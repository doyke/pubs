                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General
   1.1.1. The
25th Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) and 432d Operations Support Squadron Weather
Flight (432 OSS/OSW) are the official weather information agencies for and provide weather
services to the 432d Wing (432 WG) and other units assigned to Creech AFB NV.
Basic concepts and procedures are outlined in Air Force and Air Combat Command directives.
   1.1.2. This document establishes requirements and procedures for weather support, which
   must be coordinated at the local level to meet mission needs. It consolidates weather support
   requirements and procedures for peacetime operations and eliminates the need for written
   agreements between the weather unit and supported operations. It does not cover weather
   support procedures for emergency war operations or certain other special operations or
   procedures. These are covered in applicable plans/regulations.
1.2. Designators. All weather products disseminated by or for Creech AFB will use KINS as
the ICAO location indicator. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) index number is
72387.
1.3. Weather Operations.
   1.3.1. The 25 OWS at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, provides regional and operational-
   level weather products and information to Air Force and Army units operating in the western
   CONUS. The OSW at each Air Force and Army location will focus on providing tactical-
   level weather products and information needed for mission execution and provide weather
   products and information to the commander of deployed forces during wartime, contingency,
   and exercise operations.
1.4. Assumptions. Adequate resources and communications will be available to execute this
instruction and sufficient weather intelligence will be available from various sources on which to
base weather operations and production.
1.5. Shortfalls and Limiting Factors.
   1.5.1. There is a lack of adequate wind sensor instrumentation at Creech AFB. Currently the
   ASOS provides the official wind sensor for Creech AFB and is located on runway 08. As a
   temporary solution the 432 OSS/OSW has installed a TMOS-P located on runway 26. The
   readings from this wind sensor are unofficial, however, in the interest of flight safety, the 432
   OSS/OSW and 25 OWS utilize the wind data to support meteorological decisions.
1.6. Duty Priorities. All base weather station (BWS) tasks cannot be accomplished
simultaneously. Duty priorities are established to ensure tasks are accomplished in order of
relative importance and publicized to avoid misunderstanding among supported agencies. Duty
priorities will ensure timely response to situations under normal conditions. This list will not
replace good judgment. Weather technicians may deviate in the best interest of flight safety

and/or protection of personnel or property. Weather technicians will use the following priority

1.9. Backup Weather Support. If weather operations at 25 OWS are interrupted (e.g., power
outage, natural disaster), the 25 OWS will notify the 432 OSS/OSW. The Creech AFB terminal
aerodrome forecast (TAF), weather watch, weather warning, and advisory responsibility will be
transferred to the 432 OSS/OSW until such time the 25 OWS is postured to resume operations.
Responsibility for other 25 OWS products (e.g., graphical products) will be transferred to other
agencies as necessary to continue weather information flow to Creech AFB personnel.
1.10. Base Weather Station (BWS) Evacuation. If the 432 OSS/OSW is required to evacuate
the BWS, the team will relocate to the alternate operating location (AOL), which is located in
building 707 (11 RS) along the flight line in Room 136, DSN 384-0763.
   1.10.1. The 25 OWS will assume the following duties until the 432 OSS/OSW resumes
   operations:
       1.10.1.1. Perform Meteorological Watch (METWATCH) and MISSIONWATCH for
       432 WG operations and issue all terminal and area weather watches, warnings and
       advisories to the best of their ability.
       1.10.1.2. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF). If the 432 OSS/OSW is unable to produce
       MEFs from the alternate site, the 25 OWS will produce and update the MEFs for the
       432 WG using the 25 OWS standard format. The MEFs will be posted on the 25 OWS
       website under the Unit Tailored Pages link.
       1.10.1.3. The 25 OWS will assume responsibility for all other flight weather MEFs for
       missions departing Creech AFB and conduct limited MISSIONWATCH for these flights.
   1.10.2. Upon arrival at building 707, the 432 OSS/OSW will standup operations, take an
   observation and assume the ―eyes forward‖ function, and notify the Supervisor of Flying,
   Operations Supervisors (11 RS/42 ATKS/556 TES), Air Traffic Control Tower, 432 MOC,
   25 OWS, Airfield Operations, Creech AFB Fire Department (99 CES OL-B) , and 57 WG
   Command Post, 432 OSS OIC/Superintendent.
   1.10.3. The weather technician will provide the following services from the AOL:
       1.10.3.1. Should the ASOS be rendered unusable, take surface weather observations
       using all available resources and disseminate observations by JAAWIN, phone or email.
       An observation will be taken within 15 minutes of arriving at building 707 containing, at
       a minimum, prevailing visibility, present weather and obscurations, sky condition, wind
       direction and speed, temperature and dew point, and altimeter setting.
       1.10.3.2. Continue to issue and update MEFs if the capability exists. The MEF will
       continue to be updated on the 432 OSS/OSW webpage if possible. If the webpage is
       inaccessible, the MEF will be faxed or emailed to the squadrons.
       1.10.3.3. Provide METWATCH for Creech AFB from the AOL. Weather warnings,
       watches, and advisories will be disseminated by phone since N-TFS will not be available.

        1.10.3.4. Brief aircrew and MISSIONWATCH. Briefings will be conducted via email or
        in-person at the new location by phone or via fax.
     1.10.4. PMSV radio support is not available at Creech AFB. If needed, the 432 OSS/OSW
     communicates with the remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) aircrew via land mobile radios
     (LMR) and phones.
     1.10.5. Timeliness and accuracy of services provided from the AOL will diminish somewhat
     due to limited communications and use of backup equipment.
1.11. New-Tactical Forecast System (N-TFS). The 432 OSS/OSW is the only agency on
Creech AFB that receives weather data (i.e. watches, warning, advisories, and forecasts) via N-
TFS. All supported agencies on Creech AFB receive weather data from the 432 OSS/OSW or
Nellis AFB Command Post via telephone and/or LAN. In the event the 432 OSS/OSW has to
evacuate, supported agencies will continue to receive weather data via telephone and/or LAN.
1.12. Release of Weather Information. Support to non-governmental agencies and the general
public will not be provided until the 432 WG Public Affairs office has given approval. 432 WG
Public Affairs can be reached at: DSN 384-1371 or Commercial 702-404-1371.

                              AIRFIELD SERVICES ELEMENT

2.1. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). During normal airfield operating hours, a BWW is
normally conducted from the weather unit by weather personnel who, because of other weather
operations duties, cannot monitor the weather continuously. Due to these other weather duties,
weather personnel on duty may not detect and report all weather changes as they occur. The
BWW observing program has been implemented to establish the minimum requirements needed
to ensure the proper level of weather watch is maintained. During a BWW, weather personnel
will recheck weather conditions, at intervals not to exceed 20 minutes since the last
observation/recheck, to determine the need for a SPECI observation, when any of the following
conditions are observed to be occurring or are forecast to occur within 1 hour:
   2.1.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
   2.1.2. Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet.
   2.1.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 miles (4,800 meters).
   2.1.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 miles (4,800 meters).
   2.1.5. Precipitation (any form).
   2.1.6. Fog.
   2.1.7. In addition to the above minimum requirements, weather personnel will remain alert
   for any other changes in weather conditions that will require a Aviation Selected Special
   Weather Report (SPECI) observation. Weather personnel will also monitor local area
   observations and forecast products as often as necessary to keep abreast of changes expected
   to affect their area of responsibility.
   2.1.8. When a reliable source (ATC personnel, pilots, law enforcement, etc.) reports weather
   conditions different from the last report, weather personnel will recheck the weather and, if
   required, disseminate a new observation.
2.2. Cooperative Weather Watch. A Cooperative Weather Watch is the name given for the
cooperation between weather personnel and control tower operators in identifying significant
weather changes. The primary concern is the occurrence of previously unreported weather
conditions that could affect flight safety or could be critical to the safety or efficiency of other
local operations and resources. Due to the weather technician’s limited view of the horizon,
tower personnel will notify the weather technician of the occurrence of previously unreported
weather conditions. These include prevailing visibility which meets special criteria as listed in
Attachment 2; sector visibilities which differ from prevailing visibility, especially in the area
where the weather technician’s view of the horizon is restricted; beginning or ending of
precipitation, thunderstorms, lightning, and any other significant weather. The assistance
provided by control tower personnel will not interfere with their primary duties and does not
reduce the responsibility of weather personnel to identify changes in weather conditions. When
the control tower reports weather conditions different from the last disseminated observation, the
weather technician will re-evaluate the weather conditions. Based on reevaluation of the
different weather conditions reported and local policy, the technician will:

   2.2.1. Take and disseminate SPECI observation if different conditions warrant immediate
   dissemination.
   2.2.2. Include the report of the differing conditions in the next Aviation Routine Weather
   Report
(METAR) or SPECI observation if the different conditions alone do not warrant immediate
dissemination.
2.3. Eyes Forward.
   2.3.1. The 432 OSS/OSW integrates weather radar data, meteorological satellite imagery,
   lightning detection readouts, and non-standard weather data systems to create an integrated
   weather picture and near-term trend forecast for the 25 OWS. Eyes forward yields
   meaningful meteorological information not contained in coded observations to the 25 OWS
   and is an integral part of the METWATCH for Creech AFB and ensures collaboration
   between the 25 OWS and 432 OSS/OSW, on all forecasted products for Creech AFB. This
   collaboration ensures that all mission impacting weather elements are taken into
   consideration and ensures the most accurate and timely forecast products are provided to all
   supported units.
   2.3.2. The 432 OSS/OSW will provide the "eyes forward" function by providing significant
   information to 25 OWS concerning local area weather patterns and un-forecasted changes.
   The 432 OSS/OSW will contact 25 OWS when:
       2.3.2.1. Severe weather signatures on radar displays or Meteorological Satellite
       (METSAT) imagery are identified that will affect the Creech AFB installation or mission.
       2.3.2.2. Warning/advisory criteria are occurring or forecast to occur and 25 OWS has yet
       to issue the warning/advisory. The 432 OSS/OSW will also contact 25 OWS when
       warning/advisory criteria are forecast by 25 OWS and are not expected to occur. The 432
       OSS/OSW will ensure 25 OWS receives all severe weather reports in the area of concern
       (e.g., from National Weather Service, local news media, and unit/base personnel).
       2.3.2.3. Local weather phenomena are forecast to occur (next 30 minutes) and will affect
       25 OWS and 432 OSS/OSW products (i.e., TAFs and MEFs). The 432 OSS/OSW will
       also contact 25 OWS when significant forecast elements on 25 OWS products are not
       expected to occur. Communication is to help the 25 OWS technicians anticipate changes
       and subsequently adjust forecast products.
       2.3.2.4. Surface observations or other information (e.g., all pilot reports [PIREPs]) cause
       25 OWS issued TAFs for Creech AFB to be "out of category" or weather information
       indicates 432 OSS/OSW issued MEFs will cross operational thresholds.
2.4. Surface Observation Site Limitations. The Airfield Services Element (ASE) weather
technician is physically located inside the BWS, Building 91, Third Street. The official
observation point is located on the north side of Building 91 along runway 08-26. The field of
view from this point is limited due to buildings and the surrounding Sheep Mountains to the east,
the Spring Mountains to the south, and several smaller peaks west through north of the airfield.
CREECHAFBI 15-129 11 MARCH 2011                                                            11


2.5. Dissemination of Observations.
   2.5.1. The 432 OSS/OSW is considered an automated weather station. The Air Force
   Weather approved observation dissemination system will take and disseminate observations
   24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
   2.5.2. The latest observations for Creech AFB are available via 25 OWS webpage located at
   the following link:
https://ows.dm.af.mil/tailored_met/index.cfm?fuseaction=showunit&B_ICAO=KINS&UNIT_ID
=32&BW=H&UF=M&aor=2
   2.5.3. Weather observation code breakdown is located in Attachment 9.
      2.5.3.1. Special observation criteria are located in Attachment 2.
      2.5.3.2. Air Support Operations Squadron/Automated Surface Observing System
      (ASOS) augmentation criteria are located in Attachment 2.
   2.5.4. The ASOS has the capability to provide a ten minute Runway Visual Range (RVR),
   however, the ASOS at Creech AFB doesn’t have the proper equipment installed to utilize the
   RVR capability.
   2.5.5. During normal airfield operating hours, the 432 OSS/OSW will have a certified
   weather technician ready to sign-on to the ASOS to add operationally significant weather
   information to the observation that is not within the capability of the ASOS to report. The
   weather technician will be completely responsible for the observation even though the ASOS
   generated the report.
   2.5.6. See Attachment 12 for location of Creech AFB weather equipment.
2.6. Backup Dissemination. If the observation dissemination system is inoperative,
observations will be disseminated by phone to the control tower/SOF.

                            MISSION WEATHER ELEMENT

3.1. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF).
   3.1.1. Weather technicians at the 25 OWS will prepare and disseminate a Creech AFB TAF
   over N-TFS at 1100Z, 1900Z, and 0300Z and cover a 24-hour period. Additionally, the
   OWS produces a military operating area forecast (MOAF) for the Nevada Test and Training
   Range (NTTR). 432 OSS/OSW weather technicians will collaborate with 25 OWS weather
   technicians to develop the forecast. 432 OSS/OSW weather technicians tailor to finer detail
   the 25 OWS issued TAF and the NTTR MOAF when issuing local forecast products.
      3.1.1.1. Below is a sample Creech AFB TAF:
KINS 311919 11010G15KT 9999 SKC QNH2985INS

BECMG 0304 VRB06KT 9999 SKC QNH2982INS T40/23Z T20/12Z
      3.1.1.2. See Attachment 9 for TAF code breakdown.
      3.1.2. Specification and Amendment Criteria. The TAF Specification and Amendment
      criteria are listed in Attachment 3 and are specified IAW AFMAN 15-129 and mutually
      agreed upon criteria specific to the mission needs of customers at Creech AFB.
      3.1.3. Dissemination of TAF.
      3.1.3.1. The 25 OWS will disseminate the TAF. The current Creech AFB (KINS) TAF
      is available via the 25 OWS webpage located at the following link:
      https://ows.dm.af.mil/tailored_met/index.cfm?fuseaction=showunit&B_ICAO=KIN
      S&UNIT_ID=32&BW=H&UF=M&aor=2
   3.1.4. Backup Dissemination. If the N-TFS is inoperative, forecasts will be disseminated via
   JAAWIN, or if web access is unavailable via email, fax or phone.
3.2. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF).
   3.2.1. The MEF will be produced by the 432 OSS/OSW. Several MEFs will be issued per
   day with amendments issued when necessary or at a minimum 1000L, 1400L, 1800L, and
   2200L, if flying is expected to extend beyond 0000L. During 24 hour operations, an
   additional MEF will be issued at 0300L. The first MEF of the day will be posted to the 432
   OSS/OSW webpage before the first scheduled crew brief time or the earliest Operations
   Superintendent shift start time, whichever is first.
   3.2.2. The MEF will be amended when weather conditions cross thresholds listed below
   and/or when any Weather Watches, Warnings, or Advisories (WWAs), refer to Chapter 5,
   are issued and/or cancelled. In the absence of the above criteria the MEF will be updated
   every 2 hours by the weather technician until the end of flying for the day.
   Refer to the following 432 OSS/OSW SharePoint page for the current MEF:
   https://creech.eim.acc.af.mil/org/432d/432og/432oss/Lists/Creech%20WX%20Forecast%20

CREECHAFBI 15-129 11 MARCH 2011                                                                 13


The MEF amendment criteria are based on the RPA mission/aircraft and are based on the
following:
       3.2.2.1. Ceiling decreases to less than, or if below, increases to equal or exceed 3,000
       feet.
       3.2.2.2. Ceiling decreases to less than, or if below, increases to equal or exceed 1,500
       feet.
       3.2.2.3. Visibility decreases to less than, or if below, increases to equal or exceed 3
       miles.
       3.2.2.4. Crosswinds in excess of 17 knots.
       3.2.2.5. Gust spread in excess of 15 knots.
       3.2.2.6. Surface winds (sustained) greater than or equal to 30 knots.
       3.2.2.7. Wet runway or ice on runway.
       3.2.2.8. Light or greater icing occurs, or if forecasted, does not occur.
       3.2.2.9. Thunderstorms of few or greater in coverage, and liquid precipitation which
       can’t be avoided, to include VIRGA.
       3.2.2.10. Freezing or frozen precipitation of any intensity.
       3.2.2.11. Turbulence of moderate or greater (must be observed not forecasted).
       3.2.2.12. Density altitude of greater than or equal to 6,500 feet.
   3.2.3. Should the Creech weather forecaster disagree with the 25 OWS forecaster, the
   Creech MEF will be the decision-making product.
       3.2.3.1. IAW AFMAN 15-129, paragraph 4.2.3.3: Supervisors of Flying rely on the
       Airfield Services Element for tailored weather information to make operational decisions,
       especially when rapidly changing weather conditions are present. OWS standardized
       TAF-coded forecast products are designed to deliver forecast information based on
       common thresholds to command and control systems and provide detailed situational
       awareness for the CWT’s MEF process. This product is useful in SOF activities but may
       require further tailoring by the CWT to enhance SOF decision-making. The SOF requires
       decision-quality information that is most often based on weather impacts resulting from
       aircraft-specific or pilot-specific weather limitations, status of airfield navigation aids,
       runway conditions, and other perishable data sources not available to OWS technicians.
       The Airfield Services Element is best suited to provide this tailored information to the
       SOF.
3.3. Mission Meteorological Watch (MISSIONWATCH). The 432 OSS/OSW will conduct a
continuous MISSIONWATCH of all routes and flying areas used by Creech AFB flying units
during the times they are using them. The 432 OSS/OSW will relay Observed Weather
Advisories detailed in Table 5.4 and any significant changes in weather conditions previously
briefed to the SOF. During emergency situations or rapidly changing conditions, the 432
OSS/OSW will immediately notify the SOF and all affected flying units.

3.4. Flight Weather MEF. The 432 OSS/OSW will provide flight weather briefings verbally or
using the DD Form 175-1 to all assigned aircraft and transient aircraft (when time permits).
3.5. Space Weather Support. Space weather data and forecasts for Creech AFB customers are
available upon request. The 432 OSS/OSW provides links to Space Weather Support via the 432
OSS/OSW webpage and briefs primary products at the monthly Instrument Refresher Course
briefings. Information available includes space weather impacts on radio frequencies and the
Global Positioning System (GPS).
   3.5.1. For Space Weather Support products refer to the following Space Weather Main Page
   available via JAAWIN: https://weather.afwa.af.mil/jaawin/space/main.jsp
   3.5.2. Additional information about space weather, the ionosphere, and its affects can be

4.1. Wing Standup. The 432 OSS/OSW will present a briefing at the 432 WG daily action
report meeting. This briefing is conducted Monday-Friday in the 432 WG building. The content
of the briefing consists of weather data for ongoing operational missions as well as local weather
for Creech AFB, to include all ranges being utilized for the daily mission(s). This briefing is
classified SECRET due to operational mission sensitivities and therefore no sample format of
operational missions are included in this document. The Creech AFB and local flying ranges
portions of the daily briefing can be found in Attachment 13.
4.2. Command Support Staff. The 432 OSS/OSW, when requested, will provide weather
briefings to the Creech AFB Command Support Staff as necessary. The format of the briefing
will be tailored to the scenario driving the Command Support Staff’s formation. At a minimum,
the briefing will include current weather, 3-day outlook for Creech AFB, enroute weather and
hazards, and forecast destination weather. Other information will be briefed as requested.
4.3. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC). A 432 OSS/OSW representative will provide a
local weather effects briefing to all IRC classes. The briefing format is fixed. IRC schedulers
will provide the 432 OSS/OSW with a schedule of upcoming IRC classes as early in the process
as possible.
4.4. Climatology Support.
   4.4.1. Daily climatic data for Creech AFB will be sent to the 14th Weather Squadron, and to
   others, when requested.
   4.4.2. Other climatological data will be available upon request including data for other

                              METEOROLOGICAL WATCH

5.1. General.
   5.1.1. Certain weather conditions endanger property or life, pose a safety hazard, or
   adversely affect a supported agency’s operations. The 25 OWS and 432 OSS/OSW will
   monitor observations and forecasts for these conditions and advise supported agencies when
   these conditions are observed or forecasted. Weather watches, warnings and advisories are
   the vehicles through which supported agencies are notified of these critical weather
   conditions.
   5.1.2. The 25 OWS will generally issue forecast weather watches and warnings for Creech
   AFB. Time permitting, all watches and warnings will be coordinated with the 432
   OSS/OSW prior to issuance. The 432 OSS/OSW will issue forecast weather watches and/or
   warnings if threatening weather conditions that could impact the mission or resources are
   imminent and a forecast watch/warning has not been issued by the 25 OWS. The 432
   OSS/OSW will supersede existing 25 OWS issued forecast weather watches and warnings if
   a forecast weather watch and/or warning has been issued by the 25 OWS, but does not
   accurately reflect the onset or severity of the threatening weather conditions expected for
   Creech AFB. Additionally, the 432 OSS/OSW reserves the right to issue weather watches
   and warnings when temporal or resource constraints prevent the 25 OWS from issuing
   forecasted weather watches and warnings for Creech AFB.
   5.1.3. The 25 OWS issues weather watches, warnings, and advisories for Creech AFB via
   the Integrated Weather Warning Capability system (IWWC).
   5.1.4. Desired Lead Time. Advanced warning of threatening weather conditions allows
   local agencies to take specific actions prior to occurrence. The desired lead-time is the
   minimum amount of advanced notice an agency requires prior to the onset of a particular
   weather phenomenon.
   5.1.5. All weather watches, warnings, and advisories are issued IAW AFMAN 15-129.
   Warnings and advisories may be issued as forecast or observed. In addition, advisories may
   be issued as either Terminal (within 5nm of Creech AFB) or Flying Area (in 432 WG
   operating areas).
   5.1.6. The 432 OSS/OSW may issue or supersede a 25 OWS-issued weather warning only
   when imminent weather conditions pose a hazard to life or property and prior coordination
   with 25 OWS is not practical or communications do not allow. The 432 OSS/OSW will be
   responsible for local dissemination and contact 25 OWS as soon as possible afterward so 25
   OWS can assume responsibility/accountability.
5.2. Responsibilities.
   5.2.1. The 25 OWS will:
       5.2.1.1. Perform a continuous Terminal METWATCH for Creech AFB.

   5.5.2. Observed Weather Advisories. The 432 OSS/OSW will issue an observed terminal
   weather advisory for Creech AFB when the criteria defined in Table 5.4 occurs. Refer to
   Attachment 7 for justification and supported agencies response to observed weather
   advisories.

Table 5.4. Creech AFB Observed Weather Advisory Criteria.

Criteria                                                             Desired Lead Time
 1. *Surface winds >25 knots but <35 knots within 5 NM               Observed
 2. Surface crosswinds > 17 knots                                    Observed
 3. Moderate or Greater Turbulence within 100 NM (Surface –          Observed
10,000 ft MSL) Not Associated with Thunderstorms
 4. Any Intensity Icing within 100 NM (Surface – 10,000 ft MSL)      Observed

NOTE: Issued by 25 OWS on weekends/holidays/down days
5.6. Dissemination of Watches/Warnings/Advisories. Weather watches, warnings and
advisories are disseminated to base agencies through IWWC and are numbered sequentially by
month followed by an alphanumeric character and a two digit number, using the month of
issuance followed by the number of events issued that month. The first event in August would
be number 08-A01. (NOTE: Each warning is a separate entity and only one warning will be in
effect at one time for Creech AFB). Telephone confirmation will be used to ensure the
command post, base operations, MOC, and the tower/SOF has received them. If IWWC is
inoperative, warnings, watches, and advisories will be disseminated by phone to the same
agencies. The ―Blizzard‖ and ―Sandstorm‖ watch/warning has been removed due to non-
occurrence at Creech AFB.
5.7. Weather Warning/Watch/Advisory Text Format. The text of weather warnings,
watches, and advisories will contain the warning/watch/advisory number, the specific valid time
period (until further notice for observed products), and specific conditions expected. A warning
for observed lightning is the only criterion that will be issued separately from other warning
criteria. More than one advisory may be in effect at the same time. The following additional
requirements apply to warnings issued for criteria other than observed lightning:
   5.7.1. Only one warning will be in effect at a time (other than observed lightning), and it will
   include all elements meeting warning criteria.
   5.7.2. Warnings issued to add or delete a weather phenomenon (for example, adding hail
   greater than or equal to 1/4 inch to an existing warning for winds greater than 35 knots) will
   include the explanation ―This warning upgrades/downgrades Weather Warning # (previous
   warning).‖
       5.7.2.1. UPGRADES. The new warning forecasts more severe weather.
       5.7.2.2. DOWNGRADES. The new warning forecasts less severe weather.
       5.7.2.3. EXTENDS. The valid period of a previously issued warning is extended.

   5.7.3. Warnings and watches issued to extend the valid time will not be re-issued or re-
   numbered. These will include the explanation ―This is an extension of Weather Warning #
   (current warning).‖
   5.7.4. When the weather technician believes that phenomena meeting warning, watch, or
   advisory criteria are no longer expected during the valid time, they will be canceled with the
   explanation ―Weather Warning # (current warning) is canceled.
5.8. Severe Weather Action Program (SWAP) Procedures. These procedures are in place to
ensure sufficient personnel are available during potential/actual severe weather events or during
meteorological/operational events critical to mission success. For the purposes of these
procedures severe weather is defined as any weather phenomenon considered critical enough by
the supported unit to require advance/special notice and subsequent actions to prevent serious
injury or damage to personnel, property, or resources. It is imperative that timely and accurate
weather watches, warnings and advisories are disseminated to all Creech AFB agencies to ensure
personnel and resource protection. These procedures document a two-tier system with the 432
OSS/OSW and the 25 OWS sharing responsibilities for SWAP and resource protection.
   5.8.1. 432 OSS/OSW Responsibilities.     432 OSS/OSW will perform the SWAP
   responsibilities as defined in AFMAN 15-129 Air And Space Weather Operations -
   Processes And Procedures, AFI 10-22, Responding to Severe Weather Events, AFI 10-206
   Operational Reporting, and CAFBI 15-129. More specifically, the 432 OSS/OSW will
   accomplish the following procedures:
       5.8.1.1. Notification. The on-duty weather technician will notify the Severe Weather
       Action Team (SWAT) standby member(s) according to the following guidance:
           5.8.1.1.1. When the airfield is open 432 OSS/OSW leadership and/or a weather
           technician will be available. During normal staff duty hours (0730-1630 PDT,
           Monday-Friday, except federal holidays/authorized down days) the weather
           technician will implement SWAP by notifying the 432 OSS/OSW Flight
           Commander, NCOIC, and/or the SWAT standby member in their office or cell phone
           whenever one or more conditions in Table 5.5 are met. Due to the distance and time
           involved with recalling 432 OSS/OSW personnel, it is not feasible to recall 432
           OSS/OSW personnel during the hours of 0000L-0545L, federal holidays/authorized
           down days.
           5.8.1.1.2. During nights, weekends and federal holidays/authorized down days the
           weather forecaster will implement SWAP by notifying the SWAT standby member,
           as indicated on the current duty schedule, by home phone or cell phone whenever one
           or more conditions in Table 5.5 are met to determine if the SWAT is to be activated.

                                 TROPICAL WEATHER

7.1. General.
   7.1.1. The hurricane season lasts from June through November; however, hurricanes have
   occurred at other times throughout the year. Creech AFB is not located in a hurricane threat
   zone; however, Creech AFB may experience remnants of a tropical system that has exited the
   US Gulf Coast region or the Southern Pacific Ocean. Serious threats that can occur with the
   hurricane and other tropical systems include tornadoes, extreme wind gusts, and flash
   flooding.
   7.1.2. The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) establishes policies, procedures and
   responsibilities for the North Atlantic and Eastern Pacific. As such, the NHC is the central
   clearinghouse for all tropical cyclone forecasts and observations occurring in these areas,
   regardless of their effect on the United States.
   7.1.3. The 432 OSS/OSW will use the tropical cyclone forecasts issued by the NHC.
   Deviation from the official forecast position, track, movement, maximum wind speed, or
   intensity trend are not authorized.
   7.1.4. The 432 OSS/OSW will append the Tropical Cyclone-Threat Assessment Product
   (TC-TAP) forecasts from the 25 OWS website to the end of all MEFs when any tropical
   depression, tropical storm, or hurricane is forecasted to be within 300NM of Creech AFB.
   This information will contain any forecast probability errors from the forecast discussion
   bulletins going out to 48 hours or more. This information is for planning purposes only.

                  RESOURCE PROTECTION NOTIFICATION CHAIN

Due to limited staffing and the time-critical nature of this information, 25 OWS personnel
cannot individually notify every agency requiring weather watches, warnings, and
advisories; hence, the application of a notification chain that exploits installation command
and communications channels. Procedures developed to this end ensure weather personnel
do not spend more time communicating than monitoring weather conditions. All units
receiving these weather products must be involved in a continuous program of evaluation
and improvement of the weather dissemination system, including inter-unit dissemination.
Agencies must make certain that weather dissemination procedures ensure those needing
information receive it. Individual commanders of units in need of weather information are
responsible for having their units listed in the notification chain that follows.
