                       REQUIREMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Requirements:
   1.1.1. General. All personnel who perform Combat Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission
   Capable (BMC) duties as prescribed in AFSPCI 101202 must have the required skills and
   knowledge to perform these duties. These skills and knowledge are obtained through a
   structured training program. The required skills and knowledge are measured by an
   evaluation (CMR only) used to judge the effectiveness of training and crew force
   proficiency. AFSPC/A3 directs CMR/BMC duty positions with recommendations provided
   by 14 AF.
      1.1.1.1. A structured training and evaluation program must be developed.
      1.1.1.2. Individuals who are BMC will not perform duties involving operation of weapon
      system hardware unless under supervision of a CMR crew member who is proficient in
      the same tasks.
      1.1.1.3. Units will ensure an individual, supervised or unsupervised, who does not have a
      medical clearance, will at no time, be allowed to interact with real-world systems in
      accordance with (IAW) AFSPCI 10-1202. This does not preclude the individual, as
      approved by the certifying official, from receiving classroom training, simulator
      instruction, or instruction on real-world equipment that has been electronically isolated
      and performing in a simulator capacity.
   1.1.2. Certifications:
      1.1.2.1. CMR, BMC, and Mission Support certification IAW AFSPCI 10-1202.
   1.1.3. Task Qualifications. An individual must be qualified in all tasks for the applicable
   CMR/BMC position prior to certification.
   1.1.4. Standardization Requirements. Standardization across units, missions and functional
   areas is done to gain efficiencies in processes, to increase combat capability, and to provide
   common training products where possible.
      1.1.4.1. As much as practical, design and implement training and evaluation programs to
      ensure procedures contained in technical orders, checklists, Tactics, Techniques and
      Procedures (TTPs) and operations manuals are standardized, accurate, and effective to
      fulfill mission accomplishment.
   1.1.5. 14 AF visits will assess the unit’s readiness and ability to conduct its Designed
   Operational Capability defined mission(s). These visits ensure wing/group/unit training and
   evaluation/standardization programs meet the requirements of all Higher Headquarter (HHQ)
   training and evaluation/standardization policy and guidance, including this instruction and
   the 14 AF supplement.
      1.1.5.1. Standardization Evaluation Team (SET) Visits. 14 AF will conduct these visits

                   TRAINING AND EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Training and Evaluation Performance Standards (TEPS). Groups or Units will develop
and 14 AF will publish CMR and BMC TEPS in their respective mission areas. All TEPS will
be approved by the 14 AF and will be courtesy copied to HQ AFSPC/A3T prior to publication.
14 AF will provide guidance to wings on implementation/use within the 14 supplement to this
instruction. At a minimum, the TEPS will contain all the tasks/sub-tasks associated with mission
accomplishment. Ensure the TEPS contain all the specific performance proficiency standards
and evaluation constraints (or givens) for each task. Additionally, assign Air Force proficiency
codes, as described in AFMAN 36-2236, to each mission ready task (see Attachment 3). To
assist in development of 14 AF TEPS, reference Attachment 2.
   2.1.1. Task Standard Level Descriptions. The NAF will use three task standard levels for
   each task: A, B, and C. All tasks/subtasks will be documented in a comprehensive task/sub-
   task list developed by the units, approved by the NAF, and coordinated through AFSPC/A3T.
   Additionally, ensure the TEPS contain detailed givens/constraints, performance, and
   standards for all critical tasks/subtasks.
       2.1.1.1. Level A/Critical task/sub-task. Critical tasks are tasks that could result in
       mission failure, endangerment of human life, serious injury or death. Critical tasks have
       the greatest potential for extreme mission or personnel impacts and drive the most
       stringent training and evaluation program requirements. Critical tasks apply to time-
       sensitive tasks or tasks that must be accomplished as expeditiously as possible without
       any intervening lower priority actions that would, in the normal sequence of events,
       adversely affect task performance/outcome.
       2.1.1.2. Level B/Essential task/sub-task. Essential tasks are tasks deemed integral to the
       performance of other tasks and required to sustain acceptable weapon system operations
       and mission execution. Essential tasks drive significant training and evaluation
       requirements. Operators must accomplish Level B tasks properly without taking any
       intervening lower priority actions that would, in the normal sequence of events, adversely
       affect task performance/outcome.
       2.1.1.3. Level C/Non-Essential task/sub-task. Non-Essential tasks are rudimentary or
       simple tasks related to weapons system operations that by themselves have little or no
       impact on mission execution.             Non- Essential tasks require the least stringent
       training and evaluation requirements. Applies to tasks where no specific time standard is
       identified. The standard is to accomplish the task proficiently IAW technical orders and
       governing directives.
   2.1.2. TEPS Use Guidelines. The TEPS will detail task performance, standards (to include
   any applicable timing requirements), and constraints for the express purpose of standardizing
   training and evaluation that supports operational mission ready certification requirements.
   They are intended for the preparation of training and evaluation materials in a controlled
   environment and will not supplement technical data or instructions. They will not be used as
   guidance to accomplish a task during evaluation, training, or actual weapon system
   operation.
 16                                           AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


      2.1.2.1. TEPS Environment. TEPS will be designed for problem presentation in the
      controlled training (i.e., simulator, part task trainer) environment, however, they will
      apply to training and evaluation conducted in the operational environment. Due to the
      uncontrolled nature of the real-world operational environment, instructors and evaluators
      must be prudent in the application of TEPS during training and evaluation in these
      environments.
      2.1.2.2. TEPS Responses. TEPS may not describe the only correct crew member
      response. Correct responses are determined from technical data and command
      instructions/directives.
   2.1.3. (Added-14 AF) TEPS will consist of the following components:
      2.1.3.1. (Added-14 AF) Comprehensive Task List (CTL). List all tasks and subtasks
      required for mission accomplishment. All tasks will be classified as either Critical,
      Essential or Non-essential based on the definitions in paragraphs 2.1.1.1. through 2.1.1.3.
      The classification of the tasks will be approved by 14 AF/A3V, and coordinated through
      AFSPC/A3T.
      2.1.3.2. (Added-14 AF) Performance standards. Each task and subtask (where
      applicable) must have a concise performance standard which states the actions required to
      demonstrate correct performance of the task. These standards may be as simple as a
      statement to perform the action without error or to a list of specific criteria, depending on
      the complexity of the task. These performance standards will contain the following items
      where required:
          2.1.3.2.1. (Added-14 AF) Specific criteria for correct performance, including
          applicable parameters.
          2.1.3.2.2. (Added-14 AF) Higher headquarters or local time standards.
          2.1.3.2.3. (Added-14 AF) Specific conditions/constraints required for correct
          task/subtask presentation (if applicable).
          2.1.3.2.4. (Added-14 AF) Any trainee/evaluatee action (or lack of action) that
          results in an automatic failure to meet the performance standard.
      2.1.3.3. (Added-14 AF) Proficiency codes. Assign the appropriate AF proficiency code
      to each task (See attachment 3).
2.2. Deficiency Codes (DC). Use the following DCs to describe why a trainee/evaluatee
committed a deviation/error.
   2.2.1. DC01-Lack of Knowledge. Did not know or unable to discern requirement. May be
   indicated by failure to accomplish a required task/subtask or accomplishing an incorrect
   task/subtask.
   2.2.2. DC02-Lack of Proficiency. Knew the requirement, but experienced difficulty because
   of a skill, ability, or expertise deficiency. May be indicated by failure to meet stated time
   standards.
   2.2.3. DC03-Lack of Association. Did not associate the impact of various status. Could not
   correlate information.
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                         17


   2.2.4. DC04-Lack of Discipline. Inattention to detail, for example, skipped steps, misread
   clock, or did not detect status. May be indicated by poor checklist discipline.
   2.2.5. DC05-Other. Any identifiable deficiency not otherwise listed. If this code is used, a
   complete description of the cause of the deficiency must be included in the remarks.
   2.2.6. DC06-Faulty Prioritization. Accomplished task/subtask, but unnecessarily delayed a
   relatively more urgent task/subtask.
   2.2.7. DC07-Inadequate Crew Coordination. May be indicated when one crew member had
   incomplete status, or when the error was attributed to inadequate use of demand-response
   techniques.
2.3. Scenario Support Personnel. In addition to instructors and evaluators, those who
participate in presenting a training or evaluation scenario are considered scenario support
personnel. These may include, but are not limited to, the following: sim switch, trainer operator,
trusted agents, and other personnel necessary to ensure proper scenario presentation.
   2.3.1. Use support personnel to simulate external and internal agencies, and receive and pass
   event responses, as required.
   2.3.2. (Added-14 AF) Scenario Support Personnel Pre-Brief. Instructors/Evaluators will
   conduct a pre-brief to ensure scenario support personnel clearly understand the rules of
   engagement. At a minimum, include the following items in the pre-brief:
       2.3.2.1. (Added-14 AF) Script inputs and expected responses. These responses should
       be realistic and follow the responses expected from actual agencies.
       2.3.2.2. (Added-14 AF) Avoid prompting. Do not provide more information than what
       normally would be available. This information will always be consistent with technical
       orders, operations manuals, HHQ instructions, and the information specified by the
       script.
       2.3.2.3. (Added-14 AF) Coordinate           inputs   and    expected     responses    with
       instructors/evaluators.
       2.3.2.4. (Added-14 AF) If during the scenario, support personnel are not sure what
       response is needed, refer the trainee/evaluatee to the instructor/evaluator or ask the
       instructor/evaluator for guidance.
       2.3.2.5. (Added-14 AF) Comply with local safety policy.
       2.3.2.6. (Added-14 AF) Additional information as required by the unit.
2.4. Individual Qualification Folders (IQF). Maintain an IQF for all CMR and BMC
personnel. At a minimum, this folder will include individual training and evaluation
documentation. Electronic formatted IQFs are authorized provided proper security measures,
backup capability, and sustainment plans are in place. Software applications capturing the same
information obtained by the AFSPC Form 91/91A are authorized provided the unit gains
approval by AFSPC/A3TT prior to use. Reference AFI 33-360 for guidance on gaining
approval. For units using electronic forms, develop a plan to ensure adequate security
procedures are in place to prevent tampering by unauthorized personnel and to document timely
back-up and recovery procedures. Regardless of format (hardcopy/electronic), the unit is
ultimately responsible for the information contained on these forms.
 18                                             AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


2.4. (14 AF)Units will maintain IQFs in six-part folders, unless maintained
electronically. If IQFs are electronic in format, the unit must retain the ability to print records if
requested. If the organizational structure is such that a single folder cannot be efficiently used,
units may use more than one six-part folder for each individual. In all cases, use the format
specified in the following paragraphs. Before the permanent change of station (PCS) of an
individual, return all documents to a single IQF. For individuals transitioning to a reserve
position, annotate the date of transition on the AFSPC Form 91 and continue using the same IQF.
If the individual transitions to a reserve position and changes operational systems (i.e., is
decertified in one system and will become CMR in another), follow the requirements for a PCS.
   2.4.1. Use of the AFSPC Form 91, Individual’s Record of Duties and Qualification, is
   mandatory. Use this form to document the individual’s entire history while assigned to a
   CMR or BMC duty position. As a minimum, document the following information on the
   AFSPC Form 91:
       2.4.1.1. Arrival/Departure from unit.
       2.4.1.2. Entry into Combat Mission Ready (CMR), Basic Mission Capable (BMC),
       Mission Qualification Training (MQT), Requalification Training (RQT), or Upgrade
       Training (UT).
       2.4.1.3. Certification(s) and decertification(s) (e.g., CMR, BMC, instructor, evaluator,
       etc.). Include reason for decertification entries.
       2.4.1.4. Placement in and removal from restricted status (CMR, BMC, task, instructor,
       evaluator).
       2.4.1.5. Evaluation/Observation results.
       2.4.1.6. Instructor/Evaluator annual observation.
       2.4.1.7. Appointment/Removal as Subject Matter Expert.
       2.4.1.8. (Added-14 AF) CMR and Instructor/Evaluator Recurring Training (IRT/ERT).
       Annotate CMR Recurring Training (RT) on the AFSPC Form 91, including all
       performance scenarios (regardless of the number of tasks/subtasks included), classroom
       training, knowledge tests, and self-study as required. Documentation will include the
       results (e.g., ―satisfactory‖ or the test score). If an individual is CMR in more than one
       position(s), specify to what position the RT applies. Individual tasks trained/evaluated are
       not required to be specifically annotated on the AFSPC Form 91; however,
       accompanying training/evaluation forms should reference the appropriate script or lesson
       plan used for training/evaluation and list the trained/evaluated tasks/subtasks.
           2.4.1.8.1. (Added-14 AF) Document Dual-position certified individuals in a single
           entry on the AFSPC Form 91 (i.e. RT CCH/SCO). Document Multi-position certified
           individuals in multiple entries on the AFSPC Form 91.
       2.4.1.9. (Added-14 AF) Individual Training (IT).  IT completion date will be
       documented on the AFSPC Form 91. Any performance scenarios associated with IT will
       be documented on the 14 AF Form 14.
       2.4.1.10. (Added-14 AF) Supplemental Training (ST). ST completion date will be
       documented on the AFSPC Form 91. Identify the ST number, subject and position(s) for
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                     19


     which ST occurred (e.g., ST 07-01, Operations Capability (OPSCAP) reporting
     procedures for CMDR). Any performance scenarios associated with ST will be
     documented on the 14 AF Form 14.
  2.4.2. Use of the AFSPC Form 91A, Record of Signatures, is mandatory. Use this form to
  record all required certification and decertification signatures: CMR, BMC, instructor,
  evaluator, etc. The AFSPC Form 91A will relate signatures back to entries on the AFSPC
  Form 91.        Digital signatures are authorized provided the units institute an
  authentication/security system (e.g., card readers used with the Common Access Card
  authentication system).
  2.4.3. Provide AFSPC Form 91 and AFSPC Form 91A, or a copy of pertinent digital data, to
  individual upon permanent change of station (PCS).
  2.4.4. (Added-14 AF) Maintain only one set of records regardless of how many folders
  comprise an individual’s IQF. At all organizational levels that maintain IQFs, the training
  and stan/eval elements are jointly responsible for the quality control of the IQFs.
  2.4.5. (Added-14 AF) If an individual’s IQF is maintained in more than one folder, folders
  may be maintained in separate locations.
  2.4.6. (Added-14 AF) Contents of IQF. Divide the IQFs into six sections:
     2.4.6.1. (Added-14 AF) Section 1 – AFSPC Form 91, Individual’s Record of Duties and
     Qualification, AFSPC Form 91A, Record of Signatures, and Memoranda for Record
     (MFR). Place AFSPC Form(s) 91 on top with the AFSPC Form 91A directly underneath.
     Post MFRs in reverse chronological order (most recent on top) beneath the AFSPC
     Form(s) 91A. Document situations found in the IQF that cannot be corrected or require
     further explanation on an MFR. If AFSPC Forms 91 are electronically maintained, only
     the AFSPC Form 91A must be maintained in section 1. AFSPC Forms 91A may be
     maintained electronically only if the digital signatures comply with paragraph 2.4.2 of
     this instruction and all other applicable guidance.
     2.4.6.2. (Added-14 AF) Section 2 – Record of Training. Includes training performance
     comments documented on the 14 AF Form 14. File in reverse chronological order (most
     recent on top).
     2.4.6.3. (Added-14 AF) Section 3 – Record of Evaluation. Includes evaluation
     performance comments and corrective actions documented on the 14 AF Form 6. File in
     reverse chronological order (most recent on top).
     2.4.6.4. (Added-14 AF) Section 4 – Miscellaneous. Includes materials other than those
     listed in the preceding and following paragraphs, as determined by the unit (e.g.,
     Individual Training Plans).
     2.4.6.5. (Added-14 AF) Section 5 – Instructor/Evaluator Certification Documentation.
     Includes checklists, instructor/evaluator Initial Plan of Instruction (IPOI),
     instructor/evaluator training documentation, and annual observation material. File in
     reverse chronological order (most recent on top).
     2.4.6.6. (Added-14 AF) Section 6 – CMR Training Task Certification. This section
     includes the training documentation used to annotate CMR task certification (e.g., IPOI).
 20                                         AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


       For grades AB to TSgt, place either the Career Field Education Training Plan (CFETP) in
       this section or an optional DD Form 2861 to show the disposition.
   2.4.7. (Added-14 AF) Individual Qualification Folders (IQFs) Instructions for IQF
   documentation:
       2.4.7.1. (Added-14 AF) 14 AF Form 14. Use to document all performance training
       given as part of Mission Qualification Training (MQT), Upgrade Training, RT, IT and
       ST.
       2.4.7.2. (Added-14 AF) 14 AF Form 6. Use to document all evaluations.
2.5. Stimuli List. The training/evaluation sections will develop, maintain and coordinate a
stimuli list to document entering arguments for each performance task/subtask and assist in
standardization of performance task presentation.

                                            Chapter 3

                                           TRAINING

3.1. Training Program Requirements: Training programs, practices, and operations
procedures (e.g., training scenarios, operating instructions, procedures, techniques, etc.) will be
standardized with evaluation programs as much as practical and will follow the guidelines in
AFH 36-2235, Vol 11, Information for Designers of Instructional Systems Application to Unit
Training.
   3.1.1. General:
       3.1.1.1. Training programs must be designed and implemented using performance
       standards to:
           3.1.1.1.1. Provide and maintain the essential skills, knowledge, and motivation
           required for mission accomplishment.
           3.1.1.1.2. Instruct personnel on new or revised procedures and equipment.
           3.1.1.1.3. Provide feedback for improvement.
           3.1.1.1.4. Correct identified deficiencies.
   3.1.2. Only certified instructors or instructor trainees under direct supervision of a certified
   instructor may conduct operations training and will document operations training.
   3.1.3. Instructors must be trained, evaluated, and maintain currency in the task(s)/subtasks(s)
   they instruct.
3.2. Plan of Instruction (POI). Units will design and develop a POI to guide training. The
POI is a training guide outlining how the training program is applied and administered.
Deviation from the POI is allowed, at the Squadron Commander’s discretion, providing all
training delinquency requirements are met. Units will develop a local method that provides
verification from both instructors and students that training has been completed. For examples
of training ideas and forms, reference Air Education and Training Command Instruction
(AETCI) 36-2203, Technical and Basic Military Training Development and AFH 36-2235, Vol
11.
   3.2.1. (Added-14 AF) Units will develop initial POIs (IPOIs) to guide training during
   MQT, Upgrade Training (UT), and Requalification Training (RQT). MQT IPOIs will
   include all Critical, Essential, and Non-Essential tasks. At a minimum, UT IPOIs must
   include all Critical, Essential, and Non-Essential tasks in which the trainee is not currently
   qualified (i.e., tasks that are not common between the original position and the position to
   which the individual is upgrading).
3.3. Qualification Training (QT). QT includes IQT, MQT, Upgrade Training (UT) and
Requalification Training (RQT).
   3.3.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). Normally, AETC provides weapon system
   specific and position specific training as a prerequisite to MQT.
       3.3.1.1. IAW AFSPCI 10-1202 IQT may be waived. Process waivers IAW Chapter 9.
22                                         AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


     3.3.1.2. Familiarization Courses. AETC provides fundamental space operations courses
     as necessary when a formal IQT is not available (e.g., space lift). These courses provide
     a breadth of education on duties and responsibilities within these mission areas.
     3.3.1.2. (14 AF) The 30 SW and 45 SW will make all efforts to send personnel new to
     Spacelift to the Spacelift Fundamentals course.
  3.3.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). MQT prepares an individual for CMR or
  BMC certification.
     3.3.2.1. Training organizations will determine MQT training requirements for each CMR
     or BMC program by using the appropriate TEPS and document these MQT requirements
     appropriately in the POI. The POI contains the knowledge, tasks, method of training and
     total training time (to include estimated and maximum training times). The time spent
     per task is optional. Schedule, conduct, and document MQT in accordance with the POI.
     3.3.2.1. (14 AF) Train all tasks and subtasks on the Comprehensive Task List (Critical,
     Essential and Non-essential) during MQT.
     3.3.2.2. For CMR or BMC programs having an IQT course (or AETC familiarization
     course), MQT focuses on filling training requirements not met at IQT and increasing
     proficiency, as needed. It also focuses on local procedures and orientation to ensure a
     smooth transition from IQT to CMR or BMC status. MQT should not be designed as a
     substitute for available IQTs.
     3.3.2.3. For CMR or BMC programs not supported with an IQT course, MQT provides
     essential skills, knowledge, and motivation required to attain CMR or BMC status.
     3.3.2.4. For personnel assigned to a unit with previous position experience, but who did
     not attend IQT for the present assignment, unit training will assess the individual’s
     knowledge and proficiency on the required CMR or BMC tasks. MQT will be adjusted
     to reflect the necessary training.
     3.3.2.5. (Added-14 AF) Individuals must enter MQT within 30 calendar days after their
     date arrived station following IQT graduation. (New officer accessions) Individuals must
     enter MQT within 30 calendar days after their date arrived/returned to station following
     graduation from Undergraduate Space Training, IQT and/or Aerospace Basic Course as
     applicable. Individuals who cannot be entered into MQT pending a security or medical
     clearance do not require a waiver. Document the circumstances on an MFR placed in
     section 1 of the individual’s IQF.
        3.3.2.5.1. (Added-14 AF) While we expect units to ensure they complete MQT as
        soon as practical, as a goal, units with formal IQT should complete MQT within 60
        training days, and units without formal IQT should complete MQT within 90 training
        days. Additional time is allowed for the MFCO position at the 30 SW and 45 SW.
        These timelines may be altered for traditional reservists and guardsmen due to duty
        availability. Ensure the reason for any delay is documented on a MFR and placed in
        section 1 of the individual’s IQF.
        3.3.2.5.2. (Added-14 AF) Once an individual begins MQT, the unit commander or
        operations officer will ensure any additional duties do not interfere with training.
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                          23


   3.3.3. Upgrade Training (UT). UT is given to personnel upgrading from their current crew
   position to a new or additional position within the unit. Units may use MQT material to train
   an individual in another duty position. Tasks common to both positions do not need to be
   retrained if the knowledge and skills are duplicated. Individuals are not eligible to complete
   upgrade training unless they have completed MQT and are certified mission-ready in another
   crew position (squadron CC/DO can be initially trained directly into a crew commander or
   equivalent position).
       3.3.3.1. (Added-14 AF) Train all tasks on the Comprehensive Task List (Critical,
       Essential and Non-essential) that are not common to both positions during UT.
   3.3.4. IQT Graduate Training Verification Process. The purpose of this process is to verify
   AETC training and the graduate’s knowledge and skill through a combination of interviews,
   knowledge tests, individual tasks/subtask checkout, and/or training scenarios.
       3.3.4.1. The goals are to reduce and/or eliminate the duplication of training between IQT
       and MQT, to provide feedback to AETC, to determine if a graduate needs additional
       training on any IQT-taught task(s)/subtask(s), and to assist the unit in estimating the time
       required to bring the trainee to the CMR or BMC status. Individuals who did not attend
       IQT are exempt from IQT verification process.
       3.3.4.2. Units will conduct the same verification process for each graduate.
       Standardization of the process will identify AETC trends and assist in unit training
       requirements. The only exception to this is if a graduate arrives with an AETC
       deficiency notification. The verification process is adjusted to account for the deficiency.
       Units with like weapon systems will standardize the verification scenario to the greatest
       extent possible.
       3.3.4.3. Operational units will provide verification process feedback as directed by 14
       AF upon MQT completion for IQT and Familiarization Courses. Based on the results of
       this feedback, 14 AF will forward recommended changes to AETC courses through
       AFSPC/A3TT IAW Ch 8 of this instruction.
   3.3.5. Requalification Training (RQT). RQT is given to qualify individuals who have been
   CMR or BMC decertified, who have previous experience in a similar weapon system and
   have been waived from IQT IAW AFSPCI 10-1202 or following a major weapon system
   modification. Tailor RQT to meet the training needs of the individual and adequately cover
   the reason the individual was decertified.
3.4. Proficiency Training (PT). PT includes recurring training (RT), individual training (IT),
and supplemental training (ST). Proficiency training applies to all CMR personnel.
   3.4.1. Recurring Training (RT). RT emphasizes knowledge and skills not used on a routine
   basis, knowledge and skill deficiencies identified through feedback, and provides the
   medium for knowledge enhancement training. RT goes beyond training required for
   qualification. It increases a person’s knowledge of job related tasks, other positions, and the
   operational environment. Units will utilize their POI to guide RT. RT requirements are as
   follows:
       3.4.1.1. Train all CMR critical and essential tasks at least once every 18 months, per
       individual. Only one subtask needs to be trained to satisfy that task requirement.
24                                          AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


     Knowledge/Non-Essential level tasks/sub-tasks will be identified and approved by the
     NAF. These tasks are required to be trained once during MQT and UT. The observation
     of any task in a real-world environment, when correctly performed and when observed
     and documented by an instructor certified in the tasks may count as RT for the
     task/subtask and satisfy the RT requirements for non-critical tasks/subtasks.
     3.4.1.1. (14 AF) Units will develop an annual POI (APOI) to guide recurring training
     (RT). The APOI for RT will ensure that all Critical and Essential tasks and subtasks are
     trained to all individuals during every calendar year. The POI will be tied to the calendar
     year.
     3.4.1.2. Conduct RT at least monthly. The monthly requirement may be adjusted via a
     waiver by the OG/CC to meet mission needs, but a copy of the waiver with the rationale
     and adjusted timeline to meet the appropriate task coverage must be forwarded to 14
     AF/A3V and HQ AFSPC/A3TT. RT may include self-study guides, individual task
     presentation, classroom presentations, computer based training, and/or training
     scenarios/on-duty crew observations. Use a POI to identify minimum training
     task/subtask coverage for each training session.
        3.4.1.2.1. Crew members will begin receiving RT in the month following successful
        completion of their positional certification.
     3.4.1.3. Present a training scenario at least once per quarter. Personnel are not exempt
     from taking the periodic training scenario which they authored.
        3.4.1.3.1. Retrain and retest deficiencies noted by the instructor during training
        scenarios until corrected or the instructor terminates the session.
        3.4.1.3.2. (Added-14 AF) Recurring training scenarios must include the following,
        at a minimum:
            3.4.1.3.2.1. (Added-14 AF) Multiple related tasks/subtasks will be strung
            together to create a realistic scenario. Quarterly RT scripts must cover all
            performance tasks/subtasks IAW the POI. Non-essential tasks will be included
            when required for realism or by script flow; however, there is no requirement to
            include/train Non-essential tasks not driven by the scenario. If units choose to
            require multiple scripts within a calendar quarter, then the quarterly requirements
            may be satisfied through a combination of the required scripts or by a single
            script.
            3.4.1.3.2.2. (Added-14 AF) Present at least one multiple input to each crew
            position to allow trainees to demonstrate the ability to correctly prioritize actions.
            Although a single input may apply to multiple crew positions, enough multiple
            inputs must be presented to allow each trainee to prioritize actions.
            3.4.1.3.2.3. (Added-14 AF) Multiple inputs will consist of two or three
            simultaneous problems. Problems may be presented simultaneously; however,
            they must be presented in a manner that allows the trainee to evaluate all
            problems and determine which one to act on first.
            3.4.1.3.2.4. (Added-14 AF) Multiple inputs must be designed to allow clear
            prioritization of actions (i.e., do not present two problems of equal priority).
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                       25


     3.4.1.4. Except when training scenarios are used as RT, units will administer a
     knowledge test as part of RT. See paragraph 3.5 and Chapter 6 for further guidance on
     knowledge tests.
         3.4.1.4.1. Personnel who develop the RT knowledge test are exempt from taking the
         RT knowledge test for that period.       If tests are constructed via test generation
         software/tools which permit test construction without knowledge of the actual
         questions contained in the test, personnel who develop the test are not exempt from
         the test.
     3.4.1.5. (Added-14 AF) Dual-position certified individuals are only required to receive
     RT in the most comprehensive, task inclusive duty position. Multi-position certified
     individuals are required to receive RT in each duty position in which they are CMR.
  3.4.2. Individual Training (IT). Use IT when an individual is placed in restricted status as a
  result of evaluation deficiencies/recommendation or non-completion or failure of RT. The
  unit commander may direct IT for substandard mission performance or other situations (e.g.,
  upon return from extended temporary duty (TDY) or to correct deficiencies identified during
  a successful evaluation). Tailor IT to meet the needs of the individual.
  3.4.2. (14 AF) Any instructor or evaluator may recommend IT on the 14 AF Forms 6 and
  14. Document all IT on the AFSPC Form 91.
  3.4.3. Supplemental Training (ST). ST trains new or changed procedures, hardware, or
  software when RQT is not warranted. The unit commander may direct ST.
     3.4.3.1. Tailor ST based on the operational impact(s) of the new or changed
     procedure(s), hardware, or software.
     3.4.3.2. For changes directly affecting mission accomplishment or safety, administer ST
     to all personnel before they perform crew duty (e.g., new task, upgraded proficiency
     level, etc.).
     3.4.3.3. (Added-14 AF) When developing or changing training materials, add the
     changes to QT and PT programs.
     3.4.3.4. (Added-14 AF) The group or unit will designate a limited number of instructors
     as SMEs to develop the ST IAW Chapter 7.
  3.4.4. Mobile/Deployable Units. Requirements for training in the deployed environment
  will apply to crew members who deploy from their main operating base in their certified
  CMR/BMC positions for periods in excess of 30 days.
     3.4.4.1. Pre-Deployment Requirements. Prior to deploying operators the certifying
     official will ensure all crew members are current on training and evaluation requirements.
     The deployment commander is responsible to ensure all training requirements are met.
     3.4.4.2. Deployment Requirements. While operating in the deployed environment the
     following training requirements will apply:
         3.4.4.2.1. Supplemental Training.      For changes directly affecting mission
         accomplishment, deployed operators may receive the training while on crew. ST may
         be documented in the crew log by the deployment commander.
 26                                               AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


            3.4.4.2.2. Recurring Training. Training requirements for deployed operators will be
            altered to meet the realities of the environment. Deployed operators should tailor
            recurring training through task coverage observations. The deployment commander
            will document deployed task coverage requirements when they deviate from recurring
            training requirements based on practicality of the deployed environment. Instructors
            will document actual task coverage while deployed so that tasks not covered while
            deployed can be accounted for and trained upon return from deployment. Tasks
            unable to be observed in the deployed environment will be documented and trained
            on return to the home unit.
            3.4.4.2.3. Individual Training. For significant deficiencies noted during deployed
            operations IT will be required. The deployment commander will document the
            deficiency and the recommended corrective action. The deployment commander, or a
            deployed instructor, will then conduct the necessary training and document successful
            completion.
        3.4.4.3. Post-Deployment Requirements. Following return from deployment, operators
        will be placed in restricted status until all missed training requirements are satisfied.
        Additionally, any training conducted while deployed will be annotated in the individual’s
        IQF.
3.5. Knowledge Tests (KT). Knowledge tests are used to ensure the effectiveness of the
training conducted. KTs must comply with AFMAN 36-2236 and Chapter 6.
3.5. (14 AF)Knowledge tests are administered by certified instructors for training
purposes.
    3.5.1. (Added-14 AF) Use KTs to test knowledge level tasks/subtasks identified in the 14
    AF approved task lists/performance standards. Ensure each knowledge test contains a
    minimum of two questions per task IAW Chapter 6.
    3.5.2. (Added-14 AF) Retest individuals failing a KT using a different version of the same
    test. All tests must be approved training products.
3.6. Training Scenarios. The primary purposes of training scenarios are to support classroom
training and individual self-study, to allow students to demonstrate proficiency in performance
level tasks, and to ensure an individual’s or crew’s proficiency. Crew members should be
trained in a realistic crew environment to the maximum extent possible. Maximum emphasis
should be placed on crew training for recurring training so that the training
environment/interaction mirrors the real world environment/interaction.
3.6. (14 AF)Conduct training in a crew environment when practical/feasible. When it is not
practical to train an entire crew but practical/feasible to train a subset of the crew (e.g., a satellite
vehicle operator and a satellite system operator), units should train the subset of the crew. When
it is not practical/feasible to train an entire crew, all CMR crew positions that would be filled
during a routine operational shift must be either scripted or filled by scenario support personnel.
    3.6.1. Base training scenario results on successfully meeting each performance standard.
    3.6.2. Training will be conducted in an off-line environment (e.g., off-line simulator, part
    task trainer, etc.). Units will submit a list of tasks that need to be trained in the operational
    environment to 14 AF/A3V who will provide approval on a case-by-case basis. 14 AF/A3V
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                            27


   will notify HQ AFSPC/A3TT when making such approvals. Make every effort to limit
   requests for the use of the operational environment for training to instances when off-line
   training devices are non-existent or degraded.
   3.6.2. (14 AF) When conducting training on operational equipment, the on-duty crew
   commander maintains authority during the training session. Units will perform an ORM
   assessment prior to conducting any training in either a simulated or real-world environment
   to ensure no safety hazards exist, participants are briefed about any known hazardous
   conditions, and to determine the possible impact of training on any real-world activities.
   Details of how the assessment is to be conducted must be documented in writing.
3.7. Training Scripts. Design and use scripts to conduct training scenarios to ensure
standardization of presentation and proper application of performance standards. Include
instructions for instructors, scenario support personnel, simulated inputs, and status card inputs.
All simulation materials will be marked as such. 14 AF will identify additional script
requirements where applicable.
3.7. (14 AF)Scripts may be designed for either a single task/subtask or a group of
tasks/subtasks strung together. They may be as complex as those used for an entire crew
covering many or all required tasks. They may be used to train an individual or an entire crew.
   3.7.1. (Added-14 AF) Scripts will contain valid peacetime and wartime stimuli. Stimuli
   will be identified by area/task/subtask, estimated scenario run times, task description,
   scenario support personnel initiation/response agency, and notes/expected responses (e.g.,
   TEPS notes, trainer notes, and expected trainee response). Estimated scenario run times are
   for facilitating the presentation of multiple tasks/subtasks only and do not establish a time
   standard for completing actions. Any applicable timing standards must be annotated within
   the script.
   3.7.2. (Added-14 AF) Use input/problem cards to introduce stimuli that cannot be
   presented in a more realistic manner. They must have enough information for the trainee to
   clearly understand the input, without prompting. Clearly mark input/problem cards with
   Training Use only, but make them as realistic as possible, especially if used to present
   message traffic or changes in console displays.
   3.7.3. (Added-14 AF) Do not create actual conditions that could jeopardize personnel
   safety or cause damage to equipment. Coordinate any planned actions that could result in
   mission degradation, loss of mission data, the release of simulation information, or conflict
   with on-going operations with the required personnel (i.e., on-duty Crew Commander,
   maintenance personnel, etc.).
   3.7.4. (Added-14 AF) Script design may temporarily remove a crew member to allow for
   the training of another crew member. Do this only when the trainee is required to be
   proficient in a task associated with the vacated position. Make this presentation technique as
   realistic as possible. Instructors must ensure adequate task coverage for the trainee.
   3.7.5. (Added-14 AF) Scripts may also identify observation of real-world tasks.
   3.7.6. (Added-14 AF) Create realistic scenarios requiring the trainee to prioritize actions.
   3.7.7. (Added-14 AF) Do not use the current real-world/exercise duress words (primary,
   alternative, or exercise) in training scenarios.
 28                                            AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


   3.7.8. (Added-14 AF) Ensure all scripts are technically accurate and adhere to Instructional
   Systems Development (ISD) principles prior to their initial presentation. Instructors must
   review scripts for accuracy prior to subsequent presentations. Maintain a record of initial
   coordination, subsequent reviews (e.g., after making changes to the script), and annual
   reviews. Although instructors must review the script for accuracy prior to presentation, this
   particular review does not need to be documented.
3.8. Training Scenario Conduct:
   3.8.1. Pre-brief for Trainee. Instructors will conduct a pre-brief to ensure the trainee clearly
   understands the rules of engagement. The pre-brief sets the environment of the scenario.
   This briefing is given before the scenario (see Attachment 5).
   3.8.2. (Added-14 AF) Give the trainee the opportunity to correctly perform the action or to
   take an incorrect action.
       3.8.2.1. (Added-14 AF) Instructors will intervene to prevent a safety hazard, damage to
       equipment, mission failure or degradation, or to prevent the introduction of
       uncoordinated simulation media into the real-world operational environment.
       3.8.2.2. (Added-14 AF) Provide training to correct deficiencies and reinforce the proper
       actions for task accomplishment as soon as practical after a trainee takes an incorrect
       action.
   3.8.3. (Added-14 AF) Ensure scenario presentation is properly coordinated with the
   scenario support personnel and all other participating and approval agencies. All simulator
   activities should approximate the actual weapon system environment as closely as possible.
   3.8.4. (Added-14 AF) Instructor and sim-switch personnel will ensure all stimuli are
   presented as written in the script.
   3.8.5. (Added-14 AF) Scenarios may drive a clock advancement. Advance the clock only
   after the trainee is ready for the clock advancement. Before clock advancement, crews must
   have an opportunity to complete required actions.
   3.8.6. (Added-14 AF) Timing Constraints. TEPS provide a detailed listing of each
   task/subtask. Where applicable, TEPS provide the timing constraints necessary for task
   accomplishment. TEPS does not describe the only correct response and does not replace
   operational technical data or instructions. They are intended for a controlled scenario
   environment and are used to improve proficiency.
3.9. Training Scenario Termination. Normally, once a training scenario is started, all efforts
will be made to complete the training scenario.
   3.9.1. Early Scenario Termination. Scenarios terminated before the designated end may be
   completed from the point activity was stopped or completely re-accomplished. Terminate a
   training scenario when:
       3.9.1.1. A trainee or instructor becomes injured or ill.
       3.9.1.2. Operational or maintenance activity unduly interferes with the scenario.
       3.9.1.3. HHQ actions prevent completion of the scenario.
       3.9.1.4. Trainee actions prevent completion of written events.
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                           29


   3.9.2. Normal Scenario Termination. Reconfigure equipment used in support of the scenario
   and notify participating agencies, to include the on-duty crew (if applicable) of scenario
   termination.
   3.9.3. (Added-14 AF) Resuming a scenario following early termination. Recap the current
   status as of the time the scenario was terminated prior to re-starting. Include all actions
   accomplished prior to termination. Alternatively, at the discretion of the instructor, the entire
   scenario may be re-presented.
3.10. Post-Training Scenario Actions:
   3.10.1. IAW AFSPCI 10-415 the wing Weapons and Tactics OPR is responsible for
   establishing a debrief process for training activities. Debriefing is a trainee-led event
   reconstruction and evaluation to self-identify how to replicate success, avoid repeat mistakes
   and improve job performance. A successful debrief depends on the trainees’ ability to
   critically analyze events and the personal willingness to admit mistakes. The intent of the
   debrief process is to ensure trainees take greater responsibility for their personal proficiency
   and performance.
      3.10.1.1. As part of performance self-analysis, the debrief process should encompass a
      review of events, identification of problems, determination of root causes, and
      development of lessons learned.
          3.10.1.1.1. Review of events: In this step, trainees collect observations which may
          point to problems encountered during the event. Participants should use whatever
          sources available to assist them in faithfully recreating the event.
          3.10.1.1.2. Identification of problems (also known as Debrief Focus Points):
          Observations collected during the reconstruction are the means by which participants
          identify problems. Problems as defined here are, ―Areas or aspects of the event
          which impeded achievement of the desired outcome.‖
          3.10.1.1.3. Determination of root causes: The root cause is the main reason why the
          problem occurred. Once a problem is identified, trainees should ask themselves why
          it occurred. Each time the question is answered, the trainee should dig one layer
          deeper by again asking themselves why. At a certain point problems will boil down
          to an actionable cause.
          3.10.1.1.4. Development of lessons learned: A lesson learned is a statement
          addressing the root cause that prevents the problem from happening again. Good
          lessons learned are repeatable fix actions that lead to better job performance. A
          lesson learned should address four main points: when to enact the lesson, what
          specific actions to accomplish, how to accomplish those actions, and why to comply
          with the lesson learned. Reference AFSPCI 10-260, Tactics Development Program
          (Attachment 5) for a detailed description of the debrief process.
          3.10.1.1.5. (Added-14 AF) Units will develop a process to document debrief focus
          points, root causes, and lessons learned for trending purposes and to ensure all lessons
          learned are properly reviewed to determine if there is a need for any of the following:
          a software problem report, change to technical data (AFTO 22), recommended
          change to operational procedures via the Operations Review Board (ORB) or if a
 30                                           AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


          Tactics Improvement Proposal (TIP) should be submitted IAW AFSPCI 10-260,
          Tactics Development Program. OSOT/DOUT will review lessons learned monthly
          to ensure immediate changes to training and training products are accomplished.
   3.10.2. In addition to trainee-led post-training scenario debrief activities, instructors will
   identify, correct, and document incorrect actions and responses as deficiencies. Base
   deficiency identification on task/subtask performance. Use the Deficiency Codes in
   paragraph 2.2 to describe why a trainee committed the deficiency.
      3.10.2.1. When the trainee causes a script deviation and an incorrect action results,
      assess the deficiency.
      3.10.2.2. Do not assess a deficiency when the trainee incorrectly responds to erroneous
      status due to equipment failure or instructor error. However, instructors may recommend
      or provide training to remedy identified deficiencies.
   3.10.3. Debrief the trainee. Include discussion of positive performance, strengths, any noted
   deficiencies, probable causes, and direct/indirect impacts to the mission, personnel, and other
   organizations. Review trainee generated reconstruction, problem identification, root cause
   determination and lessons learned.
3.11. Training Documentation:
   3.11.1. Training documentation provides a means to track individual performance or
   progression, and contributes to internal and external feedback on training program
   effectiveness.
   3.11.2. Document all training and deficiencies on 14 AF developed/approved forms
   (electronic forms are authorized). Document the deficiency against the task/subtask to which
   the deficiency is attributed. Use the following guidance:
      3.11.2.1. If a crew member recognizes a status change but fails to perform a required
      task/subtask, document the deviation against the task/subtask that should have been
      performed.
      3.11.2.2. If a crew member recognizes a status change but performs the wrong
      task/subtask, document the deviation against the task/subtask that should have been
      performed. However, give task/subtask credit for the task/subtask that was performed.
      3.11.2.3. If a crew member does not recognize a status change and a resulting
      task/subtask requirement, document the deviation against the required task/subtask.
      3.11.2.4. When the task/subtask being performed directs transition to another
      task/subtask, and the trainee fails to perform the subsequent task/subtask (or fails to
      identify the requirement to transition), document the deviation against the task/subtask
      that directed the transition.
      3.11.2.5. If a crew member performs an unnecessary action which causes or results in a
      deviation, document the deviation against the task/subtask being performed when the
      unnecessary action was taken.

                           EVALUATORS AND INSTRUCTORS

4.1. General. The instruction and evaluation portions of the Weapon System’s training and
Stan/Eval Program is administered by instructors and evaluators at both the HHQ and unit levels.
   4.1.1. Only certified evaluators or evaluator trainees under direct supervision of a certified
   evaluator will be used to conduct evaluations.
   4.1.2. Only certified instructors or instructor trainees under direct supervision of a certified
   instructor will be used to conduct training.
4.2. Selection.
   4.2.1. The OG/CC will select, and designate in writing, all OGV evaluators. The certifying
   official will select, and designate in writing, squadron/GSU evaluators and instructors as
   required. Selection and designation will be annotated in the unit certification document
   AFSPC Form 91/91A.
   4.2.1. (14 AF) The OSS/CC will certify, and designate in writing, all instructors within the
   OSS and within individual squadrons. This responsibility may only be delegated to the
   certifying official at GSUs.
4.3. Functions.
   4.3.1. Conduct crew evaluations and training as required.
   4.3.2. Maintain CMR status in the specific weapon system position that they will
   train/evaluate. OGV and OSOT personnel who will not conduct training or give evaluations
   (e.g., 21 OG/OGV, 21 OSS/OSOT) are not required to maintain CMR status.
   4.3.3. Administer training/evaluations only within their weapon system and will only
   train/evaluate those tasks in which they maintain qualification.
   4.3.4. Conduct a thorough pre-mission briefing and post-mission debriefing for the
   trainee/evaluatee and applicable crew members on all aspects of the training/evaluation.
   4.3.5. Receive trainee/evaluatee debrief training, where applicable, as defined by 14 AF.
   4.3.5. (14 AF) Wings will develop a trainee debriefing program that addresses the unique
   needs of their particular mission. Instructors will be trained in proper debriefing procedures
   during the instructor certification course and during recurring instructor training. If an
   evaluate debriefing is maintained, evaluators will be trained in proper debriefing procedures
   during the evaluator certification course and during recurring evaluator training.
   4.3.6. In order to provide unbiased feedback to the training program, personnel are not
   generally certified as instructors and evaluators simultaneously. However, due to mission
   limitations, there will be instances when unit commanders must use an individual in both
   capacities. Evaluators who are also instructor certified may not evaluate an individual on
   tasks for which they conducted the training. If circumstances prevent using a different
   evaluator, certifying officials may waiver this requirement on a case-by-case basis. Waivers
   must be documented in writing on the evaluation form, to include the specific
   circumstance(s) that led to the waiver being granted.

4.4. Evaluator Training and Certification Program. The evaluator training and certification
program is designed to instruct and evaluate wing evaluators on the proper manner in which to
correctly assess crew proficiency as part of their role in the ISD process. All evaluators will
complete the appropriate training program before certification.
   4.4.1. Evaluator Training Requirements. Evaluator trainees will be observed and supervised
   by a certified evaluator. Evaluator trainees will:
       4.4.1.1. Receive instruction on the following items:
          4.4.1.1.1. Applicable equipment configuration and scheduling procedures (e.g.,
          simulator and on-line equipment configuration, test and evaluation scenario control

                                           Chapter 5

                                       EVALUATIONS

5.1. Evaluation Program Requirements. Evaluation programs, practices, and operations
procedures (e.g., checklists, operating instructions, etc.) should be standardized with training
programs.
   5.1.1. Evaluation programs must be designed and implemented using performance standards
   to:
       5.1.1.1. Measure crew member proficiency on existing, new, or revised procedures and
       equipment.
       5.1.1.2. Ensure operational procedures are being trained properly to support mission
       accomplishment, and provide feedback on training programs.
   5.1.2. Only certified evaluators or evaluator trainees under direct supervision of a certified
   evaluator may conduct operations evaluations and will document operations evaluations.
5.2. Qualification Evaluations. Qualification Evaluations consist of two structured parts,
written examination and simulator/observation. Each part requires the completion of the
required tasks. The examination portion will include a comprehensive written exam (ref
Chapter 6). The simulator/observation part will include a simulator evaluation of crew
performance where possible.
   5.2.1. Qualification Evaluation Categories. There are two types of evaluations. Periodic
   qualification evaluations are administered to ensure basic qualification in the weapon system
   and crew position (QUAL). Evaluation and certification of specific operator performance
   may also be accomplished (SPOT). QUAL evaluations will consist of an evaluation scenario
   which will include all necessary evaluation task requirements. SPOT evaluations will consist
   of a scenario that may cover a single task or groups of tasks. Attachment 4 identifies
   minimum requirements and frequency of occurrence for each type of evaluation.
       5.2.1.1. QUAL Evaluations. Given upon completion of MQT and as specified in
       Attachment 4 to maintain currency.
       5.2.1.2. SPOT Evaluations. A SPOT evaluation is an evaluation not intended to satisfy
       the requirements of a periodic evaluation. SPOT evaluations focus on a single task, a
       group of tasks or a scenario. A SPOT evaluation will reset the evaluation task currency
       for all tasks successfully accomplished, but does not reset the periodic evaluation
       delinquency date.
   5.2.2. Qualification Evaluation Prefixes.      The following prefixes will be used, when
   applicable.
       5.2.2.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a crew position (e.g., INIT
       QUAL).
       5.2.2.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
       qualification due to expiration of required periodic evaluation, following a failed periodic
       evaluation, or following a commander directed loss of qualification.
38                                          AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


         5.2.2.2.1. When a loss of qualification is for expiration of a required periodic
         evaluation, the evaluation given will be IAW the guidance for that periodic
         evaluation. Document with an RQ prefix.
         5.2.2.2.2. When loss of qualification is for failure to pass an evaluation, the recheck
         evaluation must, at a minimum, contain those critical tasks and subtasks in which all
         U graded errors were committed. Essential tasks/subtasks may be re-evaluated at the
         discretion of the certifying official. Document with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT as
         applicable.
         5.2.2.2.3. When loss of qualification is commander directed, the evaluation profile
         will be as directed by the commander. Document with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT as
         applicable.
         5.2.2.2.4. Do not use the RQ to prefix a failed INIT evaluation. No qualification was
         achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
     5.2.2.3. No-Notice (N/N). A no-notice evaluation is one where the evaluatee is notified
     of the evaluation at the in-brief. The intent is to preclude extraordinary preparation for
     the evaluation. A minimum of 10 percent of QUAL evaluations given on an annual basis
     (Calendar year from 1 Jan-31 Dec) will be no-notice.
         5.2.2.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
         daily operator performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
  5.2.3. Examination Requirements. Examination requirements and minimum passing grade
  criteria are outlined in Chapter 6. They may be closed book or open book. They may be
  oral, written, or electronic.
  5.2.4. Timing of Qualification Evaluations.
     5.2.4.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 18th
     month following the month in which the evaluation was successfully completed (e.g., a
     periodic evaluation which was completed on 6 Jun 09 expires 31 Dec 09).
         5.2.4.1.1. (Added-14 AF) Delinquency Dates.
             5.2.4.1.1.1. (Added-14 AF) INIT QUAL. A successful INIT QUAL evaluation
             establishes a periodic evaluation delinquency date for their CMR position of the
             first day of the seventh (7th) month following the INIT QUAL evaluation. For
             example, a crew member successfully completing an INIT QUAL evaluation in
             January 2010 establishes a periodic evaluation delinquency date of 1 August
             2010.
             5.2.4.1.1.2. (Added-14 AF) QUAL.          A successful completion of QUAL
             evaluation establishes a periodic evaluation delinquency date for their CMR
             position of the first day of the thirteenth (13th) month following the QUAL
             evaluation. For example, a crew member successfully completing a QUAL
             evaluation in August 2010 establishes a periodic evaluation delinquency date of 1
             September 2011.
     5.2.4.2. Scheduling. When possible, schedule periodic evaluations in the eligibility
     period (six-month period prior to expiration date). When conducting periodic evaluations
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                       39


     of a crew, it is acceptable for some crewmembers to be outside of their eligibility
     windows.
  5.2.5. Grading System. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document
  operator performance. On one level, individual scores are recorded for examinations while
  tasks/subtasks of operator performance are individually graded against established evaluation
  criteria. Performance less than fully qualified is documented. On the second level, an
  overall qualification level is determined from the compilation of these individual
  scores/grades.
     5.2.5.1. Task/Subtask Grades. Weapon System-Specific Volumes may be used to
     establish tasks/subtasks to be evaluated during evaluations - to include the appropriate
     grading criteria for those tasks/subtasks. Tasks will have a two-level (Q/U) or three-level
     (Q/Q-/U) grading system. Discrepancies will be documented against the listed
     tasks/subtasks.
     5.2.5.1. (14 AF) Units will document all tasks/subtasks and their associated grading
     criteria within the weapons system’s TEPS.
         5.2.5.1.1. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a
         satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed duties within the
         prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
         5.2.5.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned task/subtask,
         but requires debriefing or individual training as recommended to the Sq/CC by the
         evaluator. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q-
         tolerances or jeopardize safety.
         5.2.5.1.2. (14 AF) Performance that automatically warrants a downgrade, and is not
         subject to evaluator judgment, will be listed in the TEPS.
         5.2.5.1.3. U indicates a performance outside allowable parameters or deviations from
         prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely affected mission accomplishment or
         compromised safety. An examinee receiving a task/subtask grade of U normally
         requires additional training. A mission-critical error results in the crew member
         being restricted and rated U for all positions requiring that task. The crew member
         may not perform unsupervised operations duty until successful completion of a
         subsequent evaluation.
         5.2.5.1.3. (14 AF) Performance that automatically warrants an unqualified rating,
         and is not subject to evaluator judgment, will be listed in the TEPS for the specific
         task/subtask. Individual training is required for any task/subtask rated U during an
         evaluation.
     5.2.5.2. Critical Task/Subtask. Will be defined by the weapon system as areas that, upon
     failure, would most adversely affect the qualification of a crew member. Critical
     tasks/sub-tasks include, but are not limited to when evaluatee actions result, or would
     reasonably be expected to result, in operational mission failure or degradation,
     endangerment of human life, serious injury, or death. Grade all critical tasks/sub-tasks as
     either Qualified (Q) or Unqualified (U).

     5.2.5.3. Qualification Levels. Evaluation performance is graded by qualification levels
     as follows:
         5.2.5.3.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q1).      The operator demonstrated desired
         performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within
         tolerances specified in the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no
         discrepancies were noted, and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
             5.2.5.3.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any
             task/subtask.
             5.2.5.3.1.2. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the
             outbrief of that evaluation.
         5.2.5.3.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q2).    The operator demonstrated the ability to
         perform duties safely, but:
             5.2.5.3.2.1. There were one or more tasks/subtasks where additional training was
             assigned.
             5.2.5.3.2.2. A non-critical tasks/subtask grade of U was awarded.
             5.2.5.3.2.3. In the judgment of the evaluator, there is justification for the Q2
             rating based on performance in one or several tasks/subtasks.
         5.2.5.3.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q3). The operator demonstrated an unacceptable
         level of performance, knowledge or safety.
             5.2.5.3.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical task requires an overall Q3
             for the evaluation.
             5.2.5.3.3.2. An overall Q3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the evaluator,
             there is justification based on performance in one or several tasks/subtasks.
  5.2.6. Grading Policies.
     5.2.6.1. Requisite Examinations. The evaluator will consider performance on
     examinations in assigning the overall qualification level.
     5.2.6.2. Performance Areas/Sub-Areas. Use the two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U)
     grading system when applying the grading criteria definitions specified by the 14 AF.
         5.2.6.2.1. The evaluator will grade any tasks/subtasks observed during an evaluation
         if performance in the tasks/subtasks impacts the specific evaluation accomplished or
         safety.
         5.2.6.2.1. (14 AF) The evaluator will grade any task/subtask observed when, in the
         judgment of the evaluator, the evaluatee performs sufficient actions to award credit
         for the task/subtask.
         5.2.6.2.2. Minor momentary deviations from grading criteria tolerances are
         acceptable, provided the evaluatee applies prompt corrective action and such
         deviations do not jeopardize mission or safety. Consider cumulative deviations when
         determining the overall task/subtask grade.
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                        41


         5.2.6.2.3. The evaluator may further identify tasks/subtasks as ―Commendable‖ if, in
         the evaluator’s determination, the operator has demonstrated exceptional skill and
         knowledge in that particular task/subtask. Document commendable areas in the
         evaluator’s remarks section of the appropriate form.
         5.2.6.2.4. (Added-14 AF) All tasks indicated as required by the POE, the evaluation
         script, or both, must be graded.
     5.2.6.3. Overall Qualification Levels.
         5.2.6.3.1. The overall qualification level awarded on an evaluation is based on
         performance during both the simulator/observation and examination parts of the
         evaluation. An overall grade of Q1 or Q2 will be awarded only after all evaluation
         requirements have been completed and given due consideration. An overall grade of
         Q3 may be awarded at any time.
         5.2.6.3.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the operator must satisfy the
         criteria set forth for the tasks/subtasks and demonstrate ability effectively during all
         portions of an evaluation.
         5.2.6.3.3. Overall qualification grades will be a cumulative process. Evaluator
         judgment will always be the determining factor in deciding the overall qualification
         level.
     5.2.6.4. Exceptionally Qualified Designation (Q1-E). An exceptionally qualified
     designation may be awarded by the evaluator. The designation can only be applied to the
     total evaluation - not to separate parts. The designation may be awarded when:
         5.2.6.4.1. The operator has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in all
         portions of the evaluation;
         5.2.6.4.2. The operator has not failed any part and;
         5.2.6.4.3. The operator received a qualified grade with no downgrades (remedial
         action required) on all tasks/subtasks.
         5.2.6.4.3. (14 AF) Simply meeting the stated standard for all tasks is not sufficient to
         award a Q1-E rating.
         5.2.6.4.4. (Added-14 AF) The operator must achieve a 100% on the examination
         portion to be eligible for the Q1-E rating.
  5.2.7. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy the discrepancy
  and/or deficiency in performance. Remedial action includes outbriefing discrepancies and/or
  assignment of additional training.
     5.2.7.1. Outbriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during outbrief of the
     evaluation wherein the evaluator provides briefing concerning the discrepancy and
     determines that the evaluatee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to
     remedy the discrepancy. The discrepancy task/subtask description is annotated with
     ―Outbriefed‖ on appropriate form.
     5.2.7.2. Individual Training. Any training recommended by an evaluator and directed by
     the certifying official to remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
42                                          AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


         5.2.7.2.1. Individual training may include self-study, instruction, use of a simulator
         or observation. To complete individual training, the evaluatee must demonstrate
         attainment of satisfactory knowledge or proficiency.
         5.2.7.2.2. Individual training is documented in the certifying official’s decision
         section. Description of assigned individual training will include how satisfactory
         knowledge or proficiency will be demonstrated to an evaluator. (example: complete
         self study and take alternate version of test with passing score, or complete special
         evaluation of designated tasks)
         5.2.7.2.2. (14 AF) All required individual training must be documented on the
         AFSPC Form 91. Additionally, all performance-based IT must also be documented
         on the 14 AF Form 14.
         5.2.7.2.3. Due dates and dates on which individual training is completed will be
         documented in the appropriate areas of the form.
             5.2.7.2.3.1. (Added-14 AF) Due dates for individual training will be
             documented in Section II on the 14 AF Form 6.
         5.2.7.2.4. The instructor who completed the individual training will sign the form.
         5.2.7.2.5. Commanders will ensure required individual training is completed prior to
         the crew member accomplishing CMR duties.
             5.2.7.2.5.1. (Added-14 AF) For performance-based IT, the Certifying Official
             will sign block 15 on the 14 AF Form 14 acknowledging individual training is
             completed.
  5.2.8. Failure to Pass an Evaluation.
     5.2.8.1. Recheck. If an operator fails an evaluation, a successful recheck must be
     completed prior to performing CMR duties. A recheck is successfully completed when
     the operator performs to Q criteria (Q or Q- outbriefed) for each task/subtask graded U.
     Document this action on the appropriate form. Every reasonable effort must be made to
     requalify the individual. The evaluator that administered the original evaluation should
     not administer the recheck, unless there is only one evaluator available. Document such
     exceptions in writing on the evaluation form.
  5.2.9. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the judgment
  of the evaluator, restrictions will be recommended by the evaluator and imposed by the
  certifying official, on the evaluatee until successful completion of assigned additional
  training and/or a recheck.
     5.2.9.1. Restrictions should address the specific areas of operations (tasks/subtasks) that
     require supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
         5.2.9.1.1. Substandard performance in any task/subtask may require restrictions to
         ensure operational safety or mission accomplishment.
     5.2.9.2. Specific restrictions and the criteria for the removal of the restrictions will be
     documented as the first item in the certifying official’s decision section.
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                          43


       5.2.9.3. (Added-14 AF) Any individual failing an evaluation must be restricted pending
       a successful recheck.
       5.2.9.4. (Added-14 AF) Document all restrictions on the AFSPC Form 91.
   5.2.10. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an operator fails to
   complete an evaluation within the eligibility period as listed in paragraph 5.2.4.1, the
   operator loses the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph
   5.2.9 apply. Qualification may be re-established by administering a requalification
   evaluation (see paragraph 5.2.2.2) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation. OG/CCs
   may approve waivers to preclude the re-accomplishment of completed requisites to complete
   the evaluation on a case-by-case basis. Document such action.
   5.2.11. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to crew members
   who maintain qualification in two or more similar weapon systems or certified positions.
   When separate qualification is required, document certification in different entries on AFSPC
   Form 91/91A.
   5.2.11. (14 AF) Document Dual-position certified individuals in a single entry in the
   AFSPC Form 91 (i.e. CCH/SCO). Document Multi-position certified individuals in multiple
   entries in the AFSPC Form 91.
       5.2.11.1. Failure to Pass an Evaluation. A restriction resulting from a Q3 in any
       evaluation applies only to the weapon system position for which the evaluation was
       administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to
       additional weapon system positions.
       5.2.11.2. (Added-14 AF) Evaluation requirements for personnel maintaining more than
       one certification. Dual-position certified individuals receive a recurring evaluation in the
       most comprehensive, task-inclusive duty position. Multi-position certified individuals
       must receive an evaluation in each duty position for which they are CMR.
5.3. Plan of Evaluation (POE). Units will develop a POE to guide the evaluation program. All
Critical and Essential tasks and subtasks will be evaluated across the crew force every 18
months. This will not be interpreted to mean that every crew member will receive every task and
subtask, just that the tasks are presented across the crew force.
5.3. (14 AF)The POE will be tied to the calendar year. Evaluate all Critical and Essential
tasks and subtasks for each crew position every 12 months at a minimum. This requirement is
across the crew force (i.e., it will not be construed to require every crew member to be evaluated
in every task/subtask every 12 months).
   5.3.1. (Added-14 AF) This requirement must be satisfied through periodic QUAL
   evaluations. When only one periodic QUAL script is maintained it must contain 100% of the
   performance tasks/subtasks on the POE for the specified period of time. When two or more
   periodic QUAL scripts are maintained, the combination of all scripts will have 100%
   performance task/subtask coverage for the specified period of time with at least a 30%
   task/subtask variation between scripts.
5.4. Deployed Evaluations. Units should make every effort to evaluator operators who will
deploy in their certified CMR positions and will become delinquent during deployment prior to
the deployment. If time does not permit a crew member to receive an evaluation prior to
 44                                             AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


departure, the recurring evaluation requirement will be waived. Upon return to the home base,
the operator will be placed in restricted status until the required evaluation(s) is complete.
5.5. Evaluation Requirements.
   5.5.1. Conduct evaluations in a crew environment when practical, depending on the mission
   and the tasks being evaluated.
       5.5.1.1. (Added-14 AF) Conduct evaluations in a crew environment when
       practical/feasible. When it is not practical to evaluate an entire crew but is
       practical/feasible to evaluate a subset of the crew (e.g., a satellite vehicle operator and a
       satellite system operator), units should evaluate the subset of the crew. When it is not
       practical/feasible to evaluate an entire crew, all CMR crew positions that would be filled
       during a routine operational shift must be either scripted or filled by scenario support
       personnel.
          5.5.1.1.1. (Added-14 AF) For INIT QUAL Evaluations, only one INIT QUAL
          evaluatee per crew position will be evaluated at any one time. If applicable,
          additional QUAL evaluatees may be evaluated in the same crew position provided the
          evaluation script meets QUAL requirements.
   5.5.2. Schedule and conduct evaluations as soon as possible after training completion.
5.6. Evaluation Scenarios. The primary purpose of the evaluation is to provide the ISD
feedback loop to training. It also provides feedback to the individual and squadron on a crew
member’s demonstrated performance during a specific scenario on a specific set of tasks.
Evaluations should mirror the operational environment to the maximum extent possible.
   5.6.1. Evaluate performance tasks identified in the TEPS using evaluation scenarios.
   Scenarios may be for a single task or a group of tasks strung together. They may be
   administered either to an individual or a crew. For single task or grouped task evaluations
   that do not meet the intent of a full crew evaluation, the 14 AF supplement must define any
   differences for Evaluation Ratings, Delinquency Dates, and Post Evaluation Actions.
   5.6.2. Base evaluation scenario results on successfully meeting each task/subtask
   performance standard.
   5.6.3. Evaluations will be conducted in an off-line environment (e.g., off-line simulator, part
   task trainer, etc.). Units will submit a list of tasks that need to be evaluated in the operational
   environment to 14 AF/A3V who will provide approval on a case-by-case basis. 14 AF/A3V
   will notify HQ AFSPC/A3TT when making such approvals. Make every effort to limit
   requests for the use of the operational environment for evaluations to instances when off-line
   training devices are non-existent or degraded.
   5.6.3. (14 AF) When evaluations must be conducted on operational equipment, the on-duty
   crew commander maintains authority during the evaluation session. Units will perform an
   ORM assessment prior to conducting any evaluation in either a simulated or real-world
   environment to ensure no safety hazards exist, participants are briefed about any known
   hazardous conditions, and to determine the possible impact of evaluations on any real-world
   activities. Details of how the assessment is to be conducted must be documented in writing.
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                            45


5.7. Evaluation Scripts. Design and use scripts to conduct evaluation scenarios. Include
instructions for evaluators, scenario support personnel, simulated inputs, and status card inputs.
All simulation materials will be marked as such.
   5.7.1. Script stimuli will be identified by area/task/subtask, estimated scenario run times,
   task description, scenario support personnel initiation/response agency, and notes/expected
   responses (e.g., TEPS notes, evaluator notes, and expected evaluatee response). Estimated
   scenario run times are for scenario presentation only, and do not establish a time standard for
   completing actions. Applicable time standards must be annotated within the script.
   5.7.2. Problem presentation and equipment response must comply with TEPS constraints.
   5.7.3. Use status cards to introduce stimuli that cannot be presented in a more realistic
   manner. They must have enough information for the evaluatee to clearly understand the
   input, without prompting. Make cards as realistic as possible, especially if used to present
   message traffic or changes in console displays.
   5.7.4. Do not create actual conditions that could jeopardize personnel safety or cause
   damage to equipment. Coordinate any planned actions that could result in the release of
   simulation information into the real-world environment, or conflict with on-going operations
   with the required personnel.
   5.7.5. Script design may temporarily remove a crew member to allow for the evaluation of
   another crew member. Do this only when the evaluatee is required to be proficient in a task
   associated with the vacated position. Make this presentation technique as realistic as
   possible. Evaluators must ensure adequate task coverage for the evaluatee.
   5.7.6. Scripts may identify observation of real-world tasks.
   5.7.7. Create realistic operational environments requiring the evaluatee to prioritize actions.
   5.7.8. QUAL evaluations will contain multiple inputs. They will be introduced in a scenario
   to determine a crew/evaluatee’s capability to establish priorities. Stimuli will be presented
   either simultaneously, or with higher priority stimulus following soon after the lower priority
   stimulus. Do not inject unrelated tasks/subtasks (i.e., two events occurring simultaneously
   where one task does not logically lead to another) while the crew is accomplishing multiple
   inputs. This does not preclude the presentation of expected follow-on weapon system
   indications related to previous inputs, provided those indications do not directly interfere
   with the crew's ability to execute its critical actions. In short, the scenario must be written so
   that crews can prioritize these follow-on indications below the immediate critical.
       5.7.8.1. If unrelated status is presented during an execution of a task as the result of
       equipment malfunction or evaluator/sim-switch action or inaction, but the status does not
       have an impact on the crew’s ability to effectively execute its actions, the scenario event
       is considered valid. However, the evaluator should adjust the TEPS to give the crew
       credit for time spent reacting to the unrelated task.
       5.7.8.2. If unrelated status is presented during a execution of a task as the result of
       equipment malfunction or evaluator/sim-switch action or inaction, and the status has an
       impact upon the crew’s ability to effectively execute its actions, the scenario event is
       invalid. Do not assess an error if the evaluatee incorrectly responds during invalid
46                                           AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


     events. However, there may be reasons for recommending training and/or restricted
     status to ensure identified deficiencies are remedied.
     5.7.8.3. Scenarios should be designed to evaluate concepts and avoid presentation of
     excessive weapon system status. As a result, no more than three simultaneous problems
     may be included in any evaluation script.
     5.7.8.4. (Added-14 AF) Multiple related tasks/subtasks will be strung together to create
     a realistic scenario. At least one subtask from every critical task must be presented.
     Periodic QUAL evaluations must cover all performance tasks/subtasks IAW the POE.
     Non-essential tasks will be included and evaluated when required for realism or by script
     flow; however, there is no requirement to include/evaluate Non-essential tasks not driven
     by the scenario.
     5.7.8.5. (Added-14 AF) Present at least one multiple input to each crew position to
     allow evaluatees to demonstrate the ability to correctly prioritize actions. Although a
     single input may apply to multiple crew positions, enough multiple inputs must be
     presented to allow each evaluatee to prioritize.
         5.7.8.5.1. (Added-14 AF) Multiple inputs will consist of two or three simultaneous
         problems. Problems may be presented simultaneously; however, they must be
         presented in a manner that allows the evaluatee to evaluate all problems and
         determine which one to act on first.
         5.7.8.5.2. (Added-14 AF) Multiple inputs must be designed to allow clear
         prioritization of actions (i.e., do not present two problems of equal priority).
  5.7.9. Do not use the current primary or alternate real-world duress words in evaluation
  scenarios.
  5.7.9. (14 AF) Do not use designated exercise duress words during evaluation scenarios.
  5.7.10. (Added-14 AF) Additional requirements for INIT QUAL scripts.
     5.7.10.1. (Added-14 AF) All INIT evaluation scripts will contain at least one subtask
     per task for all Critical and Essential tasks. If there are no subtasks, then the task must be
     included.
     5.7.10.2. (Added-14 AF) When only one INIT script is maintained it must contain
     100% of the performance tasks/subtasks trained during qualification training. When two
     or more initial scripts are maintained, the combination of all scripts will have 100%
     performance task/subtask coverage with at least a 30% task/subtask variation between
     scripts.
     5.7.10.3. (Added-14 AF) Individuals augmenting an INIT evaluation may receive credit
     for a periodic QUAL evaluation provided the evaluation script meets all criteria of a
     periodic QUAL evaluation. Evaluators must ensure each crew member being evaluated
     demonstrates the appropriate level of proficiency in the tasks being evaluated. Additional
     evaluators are required for those individuals receiving periodic QUAL credit. See
     paragraph 5.8.7 for additional guidance.
  5.7.11. (Added-14 AF) Ensure all scripts are technically accurate and adhere to
  Instructional Systems Development (ISD) principles prior to their initial presentation.
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                         47


   Evaluators must review scripts for accuracy prior to subsequent presentations. Maintain a
   record of initial coordination, subsequent reviews (e.g., after making changes to the script),
   and annual reviews. Although evaluators must review the script for accuracy prior to
   presentation, this particular review does not need to be documented.
   5.7.12. (Added-14 AF) Maintain a record of exposure for each QUAL script. This record
   must include the name of each individual exposed, date of exposure, and type of exposure
   (i.e. coordination, evaluation, augmentation, etc.).
      5.7.12.1. (Added-14 AF) Persons may be used as evaluation augmentees multiple times,
      but will not be evaluated with a script to which they have been exposed within 90 days of
      the previous exposure. OG commanders have the authority to waive this requirement
      based on mission requirements. Waivers must be in writing and placed in the
      individual’s IQF. OG commanders may delegate this waiver authority no lower than
      squadron commanders. In order to maintain the integrity of the evaluation program,
      waivers should be granted as a last resort and when other options (e.g., another script) are
      not available.
      5.7.12.2. (Added-14 AF) At no time will persons be evaluated using a script which they
      authored. This requirement is not waiverable.
5.8. Evaluation Scenario Conduct.
   5.8.1. If during the course of an evaluation, an individual’s incorrect actions lead into
   knowledge only or non-essential tasks, then evaluate those tasks accordingly.
      5.8.1.1. The simulation/observation portion of an evaluation can be conducted entirely in
      one phase/environment (off-line or real-world), or in two separate phases/environments
      (off-line and real-world). The order of administration of a two-phase evaluation for the
      simulation/observation portion of an evaluation is optional; however, complete the
      second phase no later than 30 calendar days following completion of the first phase.
      Normally, the same evaluator will administer both phases of an evaluation. If not
      accomplished within 30 days, reaccomplish the first phase of the simulation/observation
      portion of the evaluation.
      5.8.1.2. The only reasons for training between phases are individual training to remove a
      crew member from restricted status, provide required supplemental training, or attend
      normally scheduled classroom recurring training. When conducting individual training
      between phases, limit the training to the tasks in which errors were committed.
   5.8.2. Pre-brief for Evaluatee. Evaluators will conduct a pre-brief to ensure the evaluatee
   clearly understands the rules of engagement. The pre-brief sets the environment of the
   evaluation. This briefing is given before the scenario (see Attachment 5).
   5.8.3. Evaluator Responsibilities.
      5.8.3.1. Do not allow evaluatees to use training materials, such as study guides, during
      evaluations.
      5.8.3.2. Allow the evaluatee to only ask questions to clarify a stimulus. Do not give the
      evaluatee more information than would normally be available or prompt a response.
 48                                            AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


      5.8.3.3. Give the evaluatee the opportunity to correctly perform the action or to take an
      incorrect action.
      5.8.3.4. Evaluators will intervene to prevent a safety hazard, damage to equipment,
      mission failure or degradation, or to prevent the introduction of uncoordinated simulation
      media into the real-world operational environment.
      5.8.3.5. Evaluator and scenario support personnel will ensure all scenario stimuli are
      presented as written in the script.
      5.8.3.6. During evaluations, evaluators and scenario support personnel will not
      challenge, correct, or prompt the evaluatee as to the validity of the evaluatee’s actions
      unless required to provide proper weapon system status.
      5.8.3.7. During evaluations, the evaluator can only ask questions to clarify the
      evaluatee’s response to a performance task. Ensure questions do not interfere with or
      interrupt crew actions or prompt the evaluatee.
   5.8.4. Scenarios may require clock advancement. Advance the clock only after the evaluatee
   is ready for the clock advancement. Before clock advancement, crews must have an
   opportunity to complete required actions.
   5.8.5. Timing Constraints. TEPS provides a detailed listing of each task/subtask. Where
   applicable, TEPS provides the timing constraints necessary for task accomplishment. TEPS
   does not describe the only correct response and does not replace operational technical data or
   instructions. They are intended for a controlled scenario environment and are used to
   improve proficiency. Additional guidance:
      5.8.5.1. When an event has an associated time standard, do not present new unrelated
      status until the time standard has expired or has been fulfilled. Before the expiration of
      the time standard, if the crew takes an incorrect action or positively indicates they intend
      to take no action, a subsequent event may be presented. The crew will still have the
      balance of the original time standard to recover. If the subsequent event has a time
      standard, time it normally, without adjustment for the "pending" original time standard.
      5.8.5.2. When more than one time standard is running at the same time, time
      concurrently only if specifically written for concurrent timing, otherwise, time separately
      and sequentially. This should only occur when there are multiple time standards
      associated with a task.
   5.8.6. During the evaluation, if a crew transitions to a knowledge only or basic task/subtask
   not intended for evaluation, the evaluator may brief the task/subtask accomplished when the
   crew member identifies the requirement to transition.
   5.8.7. Units will determine and document the appropriate evaluator/evaluatee ratio. The
   intent is that the evaluator(s) must be able to observe the actions of all evaluatees clearly and
   simultaneously.
   5.8.7. (14 AF) For INIT QUAL evaluations, there must be one evaluator for each evaluatee.
   For all other evaluations, there must be one evaluator per two evaluatees certified in the same
   crew position.
5.9. Real-world Evaluations.
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                            49


   5.9.1. If the evaluatee does not react to situations requiring immediate crew response to
   prevent personnel injury, damage to equipment, or mission continuation without degradation,
   the following will apply:
       5.9.1.1. If the evaluatee is not in position to note a real-world status change, the
       evaluator will immediately bring it to their attention. Do not assess a deficiency for
       bringing the status change to the evaluatee's attention.
       5.9.1.2. If the evaluatee is in position to note a real-world status change, but does not act,
       the evaluator will immediately bring it to his/her attention. If in the opinion of the
       evaluator, the individual had sufficient time to observe the status change and failed to
       recognize or take appropriate action, assess and rate the appropriate task deficiency.
   5.9.2. For real-world evaluation situations not covered by paragraph 5.9.1 and if the
   evaluatee doesn't react, apply the following:
       5.9.2.1. If the evaluatee is in position to note a real-world status change, and if the
       response has an associated time standard, bring the status change to their attention after
       the time standard has elapsed and assess the appropriate deficiency.
       5.9.2.2. If the evaluatee is in position to note a real-world status change, and if the
       response has no associated time standard, bring the status change to their attention after
       evaluation phase termination and assess the appropriate deficiency.
5.10. Evaluation Scenario Termination. Normally, once an evaluation is started, all efforts
will be made to complete the evaluation.
   5.10.1. Early Evaluation Termination. Evaluations terminated before the written end, may
   be completed from the point activity was stopped or may be completely re-accomplished.
   Terminate an evaluation when:
       5.10.1.1. An evaluatee or evaluator becomes injured or ill.
       5.10.1.2. Operational or maintenance activity unduly interferes with the evaluation.
       5.10.1.3. HHQ actions prevent completion of the evaluation.
       5.10.1.4. Evaluatee actions prevent completion of required events.
   5.10.2. Normal Evaluation Termination:
       5.10.2.1. Do not terminate the evaluation of a crew member receiving a qualified rating,
       but placed on restricted status (by certifying official), after completion of an individual
       portion of an evaluation.
       5.10.2.2. Evaluators may terminate evaluations after completing any portion of the
       evaluation if the evaluatee committed errors warranting an unqualified rating IAW
       paragraph 5.2.5.1.3
       5.10.2.3. Reconfigure equipment used in support of the scenario and notify participating
       agencies to include the on-duty crew (if applicable), of evaluation termination.
       5.10.2.4. If potential exists for the crew member in an operational environment to be
       rated Q3 or placed in restricted status, the evaluator must ensure the evaluatee is
       supervised by an instructor or evaluator certified in the same task(s) until the evaluatee's
 50                                           AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


      qualification status is determined or a CMR crew member certified in the same tasks
      relieves the evaluatee.
5.11. Post-Evaluation Actions.
   5.11.1. Upon completion of an evaluation, evaluators will determine what, if any, errors
   were committed, resolve any evaluation issues, document evaluation results and rating,
   outbrief the evaluation, then recommend training and/or certification for the evaluatee, as
   required.
   5.11.2. Assess errors (regardless of impact) IAW the TEPS and 14 AF supplements.
   Momentary mistakes due to status monitoring, inadvertent actions, or miscalculations that are
   immediately corrected, and do not result in system degradation, may be recoverable to a
   lesser severity of error, or no error, as appropriate. If an error is not listed, or a situation
   exists that may require an exception to the error, contact 14 AF for guidance.
   5.11.3. Identify, assess, and document errors upon completion of each portion of an
   evaluation.
      5.11.3.1. Error determination must be based upon the actions/inactions of the evaluatee.
      Written scenario and sequence will not affect the correctness of an evaluatee’s
      performance.
      5.11.3.2. When the evaluatee causes a script deviation and an error results, assess the
      error.
      5.11.3.3. Do not assess an error when the evaluatee incorrectly responds to erroneous
      status due to equipment failure or evaluator error. However, there may be reasons for
      recommending training and/or restricted status to ensure identified deficiencies are
      remedied.
   5.11.4. Use the Deficiency Codes in paragraph 2.2 to describe why an evaluatee committed
   an error.
   5.11.5. Determine and document the overall evaluation(s) rating.
   5.11.6. Conduct an outbrief to provide feedback to the evaluatee and training program.
      5.11.6.1. The certifying official determines corrective action (e.g., self-study, individual
      training, etc.) and any follow-on evaluation requirements for errors which do not result in
      a Q3 rating.
5.12. Evaluation Documentation.
   5.12.1. Evaluation documentation is required for each evaluated/observed individual.
   Evaluation documentation provides a means to identify trends, to track individual
   performance, and serves as a key feedback and training program tool. It provides
   performance feedback to the individual’s supervisor.
   5.12.2. Use an evaluation report to document details of administered
   evaluations/observations. The design of the evaluation report may be standardized at the 14
   AF or wing level. The following information will be included on the evaluation report:
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                          51


     5.12.2.1. Document all discrepancies. It is important to credit errors against the
     appropriate task/subtask. Document the error against the task/subtask to which the error
     is attributed.
     5.12.2.2. List all (scenario and real-world) tasks and subtasks exposed during the
     conduct of each evaluation. If the evaluatee performs any portion of a task (written in the
     script or not) and could be assessed an error, document task credit for that task or subtask.
     Technical data, MAJCOM, and Air Force directives identify the performances associated
     with specific tasks and subtasks.
     5.12.2.3. Delinquency date (when applicable).
     5.12.2.4. Provide a place for the commander to document his/her decisions about
     corrective action, restricted status, or subsequent evaluations as a result of the evaluation.
     5.12.2.5. Document evaluation errors where the cause is readily apparent. Identify the
     cause of the errors rather than just the result. Attempt to make all error descriptions
     unclassified. Accurate error documentation helps determine the deficient task or subtask
     and provides instructors enough information to effectively correct the deficiency.
     5.12.2.6. During higher headquarters administered evaluations, the administering
     headquarters will identify errors in writing to the unit.
     5.12.2.7. (Added-14 AF) All evaluations, regardless of type, will be documented on the
     AFSPC Form 91 and AFSPC/14 AF approved form(s).
 52                                           AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


                                           Chapter 6

                                      EXAMINATIONS

6.1. Examinations. Crew members will complete an examination as part of QUAL evaluations.
The minimum passing grade for these examinations is eighty-five (85) percent.
6.1. (14 AF)The minimum passing score for knowledge tests is 85%. If mathematically
impossible to achieve exactly 85%, then the next highest possible percentage is the test’s
minimum passing score (e.g., a test with 25 questions has a minimum passing score of 88%).
6.2. Types of Exams/Questions. Exams may consist of open book questions, closed book
questions, or a combination of the two.
6.2. (14 AF)Questions asked during a training scenario to clarify a crew member’s actions
are not considered a knowledge test.
   6.2.1. Open Book Exams. Open book questions will come from publications containing
   information pertinent to the operation of applicable weapon system and TEPS. The open
   book subject areas and the publications used to generate the exam will be made available to
   crew members.
   6.2.2. Closed Book Exams. Closed book exams/questions should focus on system
   knowledge and information critical to mission safety and mission accomplishment that
   cannot otherwise be referenced in the normal performance of assigned duties.
   6.2.3. Use the following minimum requirements when constructing exams:
      6.2.3.1. Twenty-five (25) four-alternative multiple-choice items.
      6.2.3.2. Two (2) four-alternative multiple-choice items per task.
   6.2.4. Units may add additional items/types of items at their discretion.
6.3. Failure to Pass an Exam.
   6.3.1. Reexamination Policy. A crew member failing an examination at any time must be
   afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination.
   6.3.2. Reexamination Period. Crew members who fail an examination must complete a
   successful reexamination prior to performing CMR duties.
6.4. Examination Management. Maintain either examinations for each crew position or
generate a unique test for each crew member requiring an exam.
   6.4.1. If examinations are maintained for each crew position:
      6.4.1.1. Appropriate Stan/Eval offices are required to develop and control a minimum of
      two versions of examinations for each crew position.
      6.4.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one version of
      the examination.
      6.4.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information, units are
      not required to maintain separate examinations for each crew position.
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                        53


   6.4.2. If a unique test is generated for each crew member requiring an exam, units will use
   14 AF standardized/approved software for test creation.
   6.4.3. (Added-14 AF) Actual examinations and knowledge tests must be maintained
   separately; however, questions for either may be derived from a single shared test bank.
6.5. Examination Question Review. The Stan/Eval office will review all questions/exams for
accuracy annually and after any changes in source documents. If a complete review was
accomplished due to a source document change it may be annotated as the annual review.
6.6. Examination Security. Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all exams,
applicable answer sheets and associated computer based/electronic media.
   6.6.1. If randomly generated tests are not used, Stan/Eval personnel will not take a test they
   author. If there is only one certified evaluator to write exams for a given position that
   evaluator is exempt from the written exam for that position. When changing over personnel
   this should be accounted for in order to minimize the need for exemption.
6.7. Computer Based or Electronic Examinations. Computer based or electronic information
management tools may fulfill the requirement for examinations as outlined in this instruction.
   6.7.1. Computer based repositories of closed book examination questions will be made
   available to the crew force.
6.8. (Added-14 AF) Documentation. Document the results of all examinations on the 14 AF
Form 6. Document the results of all knowledge tests, other than those administered as part of
MQT, on the AFSPC Form 91.
 54                                          AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


                                          Chapter 7

                   NEW OR UPGRADED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

7.1. Requirements. For new or upgraded space and missile systems, the unit training office and
standardization and evaluation office will develop training and evaluation programs to meet
requirements within this instruction, AFSPCI 10-1202, and AFSPCI 36-283, Space Training
System Management. The following activities must be accomplished by the responsible AFSPC
organization to ensure a smooth transition from program development to the Operational
Acceptance (OA) of new or upgraded space and missile systems:
   7.1.1. The unit training office will coordinate with the appropriate OSS (training office) for
   specific requirements for planning a new training program to include a validation plan and
   program approval strategy.
   7.1.2. The unit standardization and evaluation office will coordinate with the OGV for
   specific requirements for planning a new evaluation program to include a validation plan and
   program approval strategy.
   7.1.3. The unit commander will appoint a limited number of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
   in writing. The primary duties of the SME is to develop technical documentation, training
   and evaluation materials, and to conduct CMR training and evaluations. Document SME
   appointment on the individual’s AFSPC Form 91. Forward the SME designation
   memorandum through the chain of command directly to HQ AFSPC/A3TT and 14 AF/A3V
   offices.
   7.1.3. (14 AF) List position(s) for which the SME is being appointed. Under no
   circumstances will the entire initial crew force be designated as SMEs. SMEs should be
   limited to the minimum number of personnel required and should be removed from SME
   status as soon as practical. Refer to AFSPCI 10-604, Space Operations Weapon System
   Management, for complete SME guidance.
       7.1.3.1. SMEs appointed for new or upgraded systems are not required to accomplish the
       MQT they develop; however, they must accomplish contractor provided Type 1 training,
       if available, and any training directed by the OG/CC.
       7.1.3.2. SMEs who conduct CMR training/evaluations or initial (post OA) system
       operations are temporarily designated CMR. To maintain CMR status, they must be
       evaluated on all applicable tasks within 60 calendar days of removal from SME status or
       within 90 calendar days from system IOC (whichever is sooner). Once evaluations are
       complete and the individual is certified, document certification on the AFSPC Form 91.
   7.1.4. (Added-14 AF) Units must show progress in achieving the goals as established by
   this instruction and must have MR training, standardization, and evaluation programs in
   place prior to OA IAW AFSPCI 10-604, AFSPCI 10-1202, Crew Operations, AFSPCI 36-
   2202V1 and their supplements.
   7.1.5. (Added-14 AF) The following paragraphs establish guidance for individuals
   designated SME.
       7.1.5.1. (Added-14 AF) SME appointment does not require a certification briefing.
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                      55


     7.1.5.2. (Added-14 AF) Qualifications:
        7.1.5.2.1. (Added-14 AF) If an instructor/evaluator certification program exists at
        the squadron, individuals appointed SME who conduct CMR training or evaluations
        must be certified and current as an instructor/evaluator at the time of appointment and
        maintain instructor/evaluator currency during the entire period they are appointed
        SME.
        7.1.5.2.2. (Added-14 AF) If an instructor/evaluator certification program does not
        exist, individuals appointed SME who conduct CMR training or evaluations will be
        designated as an instructor or as an evaluator. Individuals will maintain this
        designation until the appropriate CMR programs are developed, coordinated and
        validated, and the initial cadre of crewmembers is certified, or they complete a formal
        instructor/evaluator certification program. Individuals who have not completed the
        instructor/evaluator certification program at the time of removal from SME status, are
        not authorized to conduct additional instruction/evaluation.
     7.1.5.3. (Added-14 AF) Once training programs are established, SMEs and non-SMEs
     will complete any unit training, for example: RT and ST.
     7.1.5.4. (Added-14 AF) CMR Status. Appointment as SME does not affect training or
     evaluation requirements for other CMR positions in which a person is currently certified.
     7.1.5.5. (Added-14 AF) For squadrons about to reach OA, individuals designated as
     SMEs for only a portion of the training/evaluation program may not be designated CMR
     and fall under the same requirements as the rest of the crew force. A certification brief
     will be required after program completion.
     7.1.5.6. (Added-14 AF) SME Evaluations and delinquency dates.
        7.1.5.6.1. (Added-14 AF) For established systems, SMEs do not require an
        evaluation in the specific task or position they are designated SME (if already CMR
        in same position). Once removed from SME status, the individual will revert to the
        normally established delinquency date.
        7.1.5.6.2. (Added-14 AF) If an individual is removed from SME status prior to OA,
        then the individual falls under the same requirements as the rest of the crew force.
     7.1.5.7. (Added-14 AF) Removal from SME status:
        7.1.5.7.1. (Added-14 AF) The Squadron/Detachment CC or Operations
        Officer/Detachment Chief removes an individual from SME status in writing. This
        will be documented on AFSPC Form 91.
        7.1.5.7.2. (Added-14 AF) Remove individuals from SME status when they fail to
        maintain an appropriate level of job proficiency.
     7.1.5.8. (Added-14 AF) Restricted Status. During periods of restriction, SMEs will not
     instruct or evaluate members in tasks for which they are designated SME. Place
     individuals in restricted status, as a SME, for the following reasons:
        7.1.5.8.1. (Added-14 AF) Failure to complete RT for the specific position
        designated SME.
56                                        AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


        7.1.5.8.2. (Added-14 AF) Failure to maintain currency as an instructor/evaluator
        when currency requirements exist.
     7.1.5.9. (Added-14 AF) Removal from restricted status. Follow guidance in AFSPCI
     10-1202 and the 14 AF Supplement for removing individuals from restricted status.
     7.1.5.10. (Added-14 AF) CMR Evaluations and delinquency dates:
        7.1.5.10.1. (Added-14 AF) Evaluations conducted prior to OA are valid to calculate
        delinquency dates, provided the evaluation materials are compliant with AFSPCI 36-
        2202V1 and this supplement.
        7.1.5.10.2. (Added-14 AF) If evaluation material used prior to IOC is not compliant
        with AFSPCI 36-2202V1 and this supplement, individuals evaluated using those
        scenarios must be reevaluated prior to conducting real-world operations after OA
        declaration. Only reevaluate individuals on tasks deemed non-compliant. Calculate
        the delinquency date based on when the individual successfully accomplishes the post
        OA evaluation.
     7.1.5.11. (Added-14 AF) Medical Guidance for SMEs. SMEs must comply with
     medical requirements IAW AFSPCI 10-1202 and the 14 AF Supplement for 13SX and
     1C6X personnel. DNIC guidance in AFSPCI 10-1202 and the 14 AF Supplement applies
     to personnel designated as SMEs.
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                      57


                                         Chapter 8

         COMMAND CHANGE PROCESS TO AETC COURSE CURRICULA

8.1. Change Process.
   8.1.1. All change requests originating from AFSPC units which are of a major nature (a
   request which drives changes in course training standard or resources such as facilities,
   costing, etc.) will be routed through the appropriate OG/OSS, to HQ AFSPC/A3TT for
   coordination and courtesy copied to the NAF.
      8.1.1.1. The AETC Training Manager (TM) is the decision authority for determining if a
      proposed change is minor or major. Once a determination has been made as to whether a
      change is minor or major, no direct communications concerning major changes is
      permitted with AETC training units. The primary point of contact for each AETC course
      is the AETC TM. This does not preclude official feedback channels such as the AETC
      Graduate Training Verification Process and Graduate Assessment Survey field evaluation
      questionnaires or field visits.
      8.1.1.2. HQ AFSPC/A3TT coordinates approval of change requests through wing and
      NAF.
      8.1.1.3. HQ AFSPC/A3T approves all formal requests to change AETC courses and
      submits to HQ USAF/A3O-ST (Operations Plans and Requirements) for coordination.
   8.1.2. Course Resource Estimate Process. Upon approval of a major change request by HQ
   AFSPC/A3TT, HQ AFSPC/A3TT will route the change to HQ USAF/A3O-ST. HQ
   USAF/A3O-ST will review and if approved, will route to the Chief, Command, Control,
   Communications, Computers, Intelligence (C4I) and Training Pipeline Manger (HQ
   AETC/A3TM). The 381 TRG will analyze the request to determine impact on training time,
   and will return their cost estimate to HQ AFSPC/A3TT for proper staffing (e.g., training
   device requirements, etc.). HQ AFSPC/A3TT will notify the originating agency of the
   results of their request. For further information, refer to AFSPCI 36-283.
   8.1.3. Changes to existing Specialty Training Standards and/or Course Training Standards
   (CTS) require review and approval by the affected unit commander, through the appropriate
   OSS or group to HQ AFSPC/A3TT for MAJCOM review and approval. HQ AFSPC/A3TT
   will coordinate the STS/CTS with HQ USAF/A3O-ST for AFCFM approval. HQ
   USAF/A3O-ST will forward the approved STS/CTS to HQ AETC/A3T who will coordinate
   appropriate follow-up actions with the 381 TRG.
   8.1.4. AFSPC units (through their appropriate OSS or group to obtain a tracking number)
   may coordinate minor change requests directly with the 381 TRG, but only with the AETC
   TM of the applicable training course. Minor changes are interpreted to mean those of an
   administrative nature or those which do not have significant impact on training curricula or
   resources. In each case, the AETC TM will determine if the request is of a minor nature or
   needs to be elevated to a major change. If the request is minor, the 381 TRG will implement
   the change at the earliest opportunity.
   8.1.5. Changes originating from the AETC TMs will be forwarded to the affected OSS or
   group for action, with a courtesy copy to HQ AFSPC/A3TT and the NAF. Once the review
58                                       AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


  is complete and OSS or group concurrence has been given, the change will be routed back
  through HQ AFSPC/A3TT for approval IAW paragraphs 8.1.2 and 8.1.3
  8.1.6. Request for course deletions must be forwarded from the appropriate group
  commander. Deletions of 381 TRG courses are reviewed, approved, and forwarded by
  HQ AFSPC/A3T to HQ USAF/A3O-ST for review and approval prior to routing to HQ
  AETC/A3TM.
  8.1.7. For all courses where ARC units participate, AFSPC/A3T will coordinate
  change/deletion packages with the affected components’ training division (HQ AFRC/A3TT
  (Training, Standardization and Evaluations) through 10 AF/A3T for AFRC units; NGB/A3S
  for Air Guard units) prior to approval.

                                  Chapter 10 (Added-14 AF)

                                  TRENDING PROGRAM

10.1. (Added-14 AF) This program minimizes the impact of recurring training and
evaluation program weaknesses on unit mission accomplishment by analyzing and
correcting operational deficiencies noted during training, evaluation, and operations. A
two-step process, the program requires units to first compile and then analyze data to determine
the root cause of a deficiency. The program applies to all squadrons with assigned CMR
personnel and to units that instruct or evaluate CMR personnel on CMR tasks.
10.2. (Added-14 AF) Trending Program Responsibilities. Collect and analyze evaluation,
real world operations, and training data separately to prevent skewing of data. The analysis
should be based on a separate deficiency scale for each category (evaluations, real world
operations, and training). The key is, once all data is compiled, there must be a process to
correlate the data to ensure all avenues are explored before determining a trend exists.
Generally, trends are identified when the number of errors/deficiencies attributed to a specific
task/subtask reaches a pre-determined percentage based on the number of times that task/subtask
is exposed during evaluation and training activities. Real world trends are generally identified
when units document real world deficiencies and therefore should have a separate threshold for
triggering a trend. It is incumbent upon Operations Groups to establish statistically significant
thresholds to ensure units are receiving the maximum benefit of this program.
   10.2.1. (Added-14 AF) 14 AF/A3V oversees the Trending Program process and will make
   final determinations on all related questions.
   10.2.2. (Added-14 AF) Wings will develop a trending process consistent with the guidance
   in this supplement.
   10.2.3. (Added-14 AF) Operations Groups administer the Trending Program process. OGV
   sections will be the Point of Contact (POC) for reports. Groups will determine when
   squadron reports are due. Groups need not coordinate solutions beyond the wing, but must
   forward a courtesy copy to the 14 AF/A3V. Reserve units must also forward a courtesy copy
   to the 10 AF/DO and AFRC/DO.
10.3. (Added-14 AF) Exposures. Count exposures based on the task/subtask level as
determined by the group.
10.4. (Added-14 AF) Trending Deficiencies. There are two types of deficiencies, an area for
review (AFR) and a trend. An AFR is a statistically relevant deficiency (based on the number of
exposures) observed at unit level. A trend is any deficiency identified across two or more
squadrons (group level) or an AFR identified a second time during a one-year period
(group/squadron level).
10.5. (Added-14 AF) Course of Action (COA). Execute COA to remedy and prevent the re-
occurrence of an AFR or trend. COA may include, but are not limited to, IT for crewmembers
committing deviations or IT or ST to all crew members in affected positions. Additionally,
training on the affected task/subtask may be accomplished during RT by incorporating the
task/subtask into performance scenarios and knowledge tests.
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                         61


   10.5.1. (Added-14 AF) The COA will correspond with the type of AFR or trend. Trends
   typically require more extensive actions. For example: A task/subtask identified as an AFR
   may result in IT for only those persons committing the errors. A task/subtask identified as a
   trend may require any or all of the following: Retraining of all crewmembers in the form of
   IT or ST, a change in the training program, a change in operational procedures, or changes to
   the MQT program. Use ST if it is discovered that the cause for the AFR/trend is inaccurate or
   insufficient existing procedures. Administer the ST after developing new or updated
   procedures and IAW AFSPCI 36-2202V1.
   10.5.2. (Added-14 AF) Provide a rationale in the COA block of the report when the group
   or squadron determines a trend does not require actions beyond IT.
10.6. (Added-14 AF) Trending Program Report. Each organizational level (group,
squadron) will provide a report. 21st, 50th, 310th and 460th Operations Groups will provide
quarterly reports. The reports will be due to 14 AF/A3V no later than the last day of the first
month of the next quarter. (For example, the first quarter report is due by 30 Apr.) 30th and 45th
Operations Groups will provide semi-annual reports (due to the limited number of evaluations
and real-world operations). The reports will be due to 14 AF/A3V no later than 31 Jul and 31
Jan.
   10.6.1. (Added-14 AF) Reports include a cover memorandum or endorsement from the
   Operations Group CC or Deputy stating Trends noted, concerns regarding AFRs or Trends,
   and request(s) for 14 AF or HQ AFSPC assistance, if necessary.
   10.6.2. (Added-14 AF) 14 AF/A3V may consolidate all group reports and forward to the 14
   AF senior leadership. The report may consist of an executive summary and a chart reviewing
   the past four quarters’ AFRs, Trends, and real-world deficiencies. 14 AF CC/CV may direct
   COAs based on the information provided.

  STANDARDIZATION EVALUATION TEAM (SET) INSPECTIONS, LIMITED SET
        INSPECTIONS (LSET), AND STAFF ASSISTANCE VISITS (SAV)

11.1. (Added-14 AF) Standardization Evaluation Team (SET) Inspections assess the
readiness of space wing’s assigned forces and to validate the wing’s ability to conduct and
support the mission. SET inspections are not an Inspector General (IG) function. The primary
focus of the SET is to assess mission effectiveness and adequacy of operations focused
programs. This includes use of SET special evaluations. As a compliance-oriented program
review, the SET inspection focuses on key areas, such as, Crew Operations, Operations
Stan/Eval, and the Mission Ready Training Program. Each area is divided into sub-areas as
identified in paragraph 11.4.1. or as directed by the 14 AF/A3V. Units will be provided advance
notice of specific areas to be inspected.
   11.1.1. (Added-14 AF) SET inspections are conducted at operational squadrons and
   detachments, as well as OSOTs and OGVs. During inspections, units will provide assistance
   with program reviews and evaluation administration. Additionally, units will provide IQFs
   (for record checks), local operating instructions and assistance during other inspection
   activities, as needed. Units will prepare binders with information as requested by 14 AF and
   have the necessary office supplies available for inspectors.
   11.1.2. (Added-14 AF) SET inspections are scheduled on a recurring basis, approximately
   every 36-48 months. SET schedules will be coordinated with AFRC/IG, AFSPC/IGI and
   NGB (National Guard Bureau)/IG for deconfliction with IG activities and AFRC Unit
   Compliance Inspections. 14 AF/A3V will provide an annual inspection schedule to
   subordinate wings. Units will be given six months notice, minimum, prior to a SET
   inspection. SET inspections will not be scheduled within six months of a HQ AFSPC/IGI
   Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI) without first coordinating with the affected Wing
   CC. Wing CCs may request a SET inspection from 14 AF at any time. Subordinate units
   may request a SET inspection through their respective wing. ANG units may request a SET
   through their RegAF operational parent wing as well as the unit’s parent ANG wing.
   Requests for out of cycle SETs are handled on a case-by-case basis and are subject to 14
   AF/A3V personnel/funding availability
       11.1.2.1. (Added-14 AF) 14 AF/A3V will provide squadrons and associated group and
       wing level agencies with a notification message 60 calendar days prior to a scheduled
       SET inspection. This message will request squadron and group POCs, provide general
       information about the inspection, special evaluation task requirements, and identify any
       additional inspection criteria. A follow-up message will be provided 30 calendar days
       prior to an inspection and provide specific details regarding the upcoming inspection such
       as team composition, briefing requirements, checklists to be used, support requirements,
       and scheduling support. (ARC squadrons require six months prior notice of any
       additional inspection requirements).
   11.1.3. (Added-14 AF) SET manning will be composed primarily of 14 AF/A3V
   evaluators/inspectors. Occasionally, augmentees may be requested from the MAJCOM,
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                          63


   NAF, or other agencies to assist with the inspection. Team size will vary based on the needs
   of a specific inspection and the size of the unit.
11.2. (Added-14 AF) SET Ratings. All squadrons are given a rating. Ratings are based on a
five-tier rating system as defined in paragraph 11.2.1.1. through paragraph 11.2.1.5. Ratings for
contractor-operated units are outlined in paragraph 11.2.2. through paragraph 11.2.2.3. Each
overall area assessed will be given a rating. Sub-areas receive a subjective score that contributes
to the overall area rating. This sub-area score will not be reflected in the final report. A
squadron's final rating will be based on the compilation of all areas IAW paragraph 11.3. An
operations group rating will be given based on group programs and, when evaluators are
assigned, evaluations. An overall operations group rating will be provided based on
consolidation of squadron and group results. Where inspections must be spread out over a period
of time, the group ratings will be provided during the SET inspection of the group. The overall
rating will be computed using subordinate squadron results added to group results.
   11.2.1. (Added-14 AF) Any squadron receiving a Marginal or Unsatisfactory rating in
   Mission Effectiveness will receive a re-evaluation from their respective OGV within six
   months of the SET inspection. The five tiers are defined as follows:
       11.2.1.1. (Added-14 AF) Outstanding: Performance and procedures in effect were
       nearly error-free and far exceeded all requirements. Serves as a model, which others
       should emulate.
       11.2.1.2. (Added-14 AF) Excellent: Performance and procedures in effect exceeded
       requirements and enhanced overall effectiveness.
       11.2.1.3. (Added-14 AF) Satisfactory: Performance and/or operations met mission
       requirements. Procedures and activities were carried out in an effective and competent
       manner. Resources and programs were efficiently managed. Minor deficiencies may have
       existed; however, they did not impede or limit mission accomplishment.
       11.2.1.4. (Added-14 AF) Marginal: Most requirements were met, but not in full
       compliance with directives. Performance and the effectiveness of the program were
       degraded by deviations from procedures.
       11.2.1.5. (Added-14 AF) Unsatisfactory: Deviations or omissions caused the function
       evaluated to be non-effective. Little compliance with appropriate directives was evident.
   11.2.2. (Added-14 AF) Ratings are given to contractor-operated units, but are not meant to
   endorse or disparage the quality of service provided by the contractor. Ratings are based on a
   three-tier rating system. SET inspections will be limited in scope, focusing on whether
   operational requirements are being met based on the Statement of Work (SOW) or the
   Performance Work Statements (PWS). Additionally, the SOW/PWS will be evaluated to
   ensure it meets the operational requirements and objectives of the 14 AF and the unit’s
   mission. Each overall area assessed will be given a rating. Sub-areas receive a subjective
   score that contributes to the overall area rating. This sub-area score will not be reflected in
   the final report. The unit's final rating will be based on the compilation of all areas. 14
   AF/A3V will coordinate these inspections with the applicable wing contractor oversight
   function to ensure no contractual interference. 14 AF/A3V will augment teams, as needed,
   with qualified personnel experienced with contract oversight requirements. The three tiers
   are defined as follows:
 64                                          AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011


       11.2.2.1. (Added-14 AF) Meets Standards: Performance and procedures in effect met or
       exceeded requirements and enhanced overall effectiveness.
       11.2.2.2. (Added-14 AF) Meets Standards with Comments (W/C): Performance and/or
       operations met mission requirements. Procedures and activities were carried out in an
       effective and competent manner. Major or minor deficiencies or Areas for Improvement
       may have existed at the Detachment, Squadron or above; however, they did not impede
       or limit mission accomplishment.
       11.2.2.3. (Added-14 AF) Does Not Meet Standards: Deviations or omissions caused the
       function evaluated to be non-effective. Little compliance with appropriate directives was
       evident.
   11.2.3. (Added-14 AF) The status of all open problem findings must be reported to 14
   AF/A3V via memorandum every 30 calendar days from the date the draft report is provided
   to the agency at the inspection outbrief. Continue to report the status of all problems until
   they are resolved and closed. The memorandum will include, at a minimum, actions being
   taken to correct the problem and an estimated completion date.
11.3. (Added-14 AF) SET Scores. For SET inspections, Mission Effectiveness (special
evaluations and observation of real-world mission activities) contributes 55% towards the total
score, while Program Effectiveness makes up the remaining 45% and is distributed as follows:
Crew Operations 15%, mission ready training 15%, and standardization/evaluation 15%. 14
AF/A3V may adjust the rating formula based on the number of crews, areas inspected, and
overall mission of the inspected unit. For SET inspections of contractor-operated units, the 14
AF/A3V the rating formula is based on the inspected areas and overall mission of the inspected
unit.
11.4. (Added-14 AF) SET Review Periods. 14 AF uses existing HHQ instructions, their
corresponding supplements, HHQ inspection checklists, and unit-developed scenario scripts to
validate compliance with established standards. SET inspectors will review program
documentation going back a minimum of one year. Where documentation is maintained for
longer than one year, the SET may inspect any documentation at the unit since the last SET
inspection, when required and as determined by the Team Chief. Reviews by the SET include
but are not limited to the following areas:
   11.4.1. (Added-14 AF) Program Effectiveness. Applicable group and squadron programs
   falling under the areas of Crew Operations, Mission Ready Training, and Operations
   Stan/Eval. Areas/sub-areas inspected will include, at a minimum, the following or as
   directed by the Team Chief. Crew Operations: Crew Information File (CIF), DNIC program,
   Operations Review Panel (ORP), Operations Review Board (ORB), Checklists/TO, and
   Temporary Procedures. Stan/Eval: IQFs, evaluator training, evaluation scripts, and
   evaluation prep/conduct. Training: IQFs, MQT, RQT, instructor training, and training
   scripts. Group inspection and oversight programs will also be reviewed during group level
   visits. Additional areas inspected, as requested by Wing or Group Commanders (e.g.,
   Weather, Spacelift Maintenance), will count toward a unit’s overall rating under Program
   Effectiveness.
       11.4.1.1. (Added-14 AF) Training and evaluation scripts (and supporting
       documentation, i.e., APOI, APOE, and IPOI) must be maintained for a minimum of two
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                        65


     calendar years from the month presented to ensure they are present for SET/LSET
     inspection. Hardcopies or scanned electronic copies are acceptable. Ensure approval
     pages/cover sheets include signatures and dates in the event that electronic copies are
     maintained.
  11.4.2. (Added-14 AF) Mission Effectiveness. Evaluations will be administered to CMR
  personnel during inspections. As a goal, 20-35% of CMR personnel at RegAF units (20-25%
  for ARC) will be evaluated. Lower percentages may be warranted in cases where other
  limiting factors exist.
     11.4.2.1. (Added-14 AF) 14 AF/A3V controls all phases of development of evaluation
     scripts. Additionally, scripts must be handled through Trusted Agent channels at all
     times. Evaluation scenarios will be crew-based and contain primarily mission-related
     tasks to reflect the unit’s ability to accomplish their assigned mission. Units will develop
     scripts as directed by 14 AF/A3V in the 60 and 30 day out messages. Units will work
     with 14 AF/A3V prior to the actual start of the inspection to ensure scripts are complete
     prior to the start of the inspection period. Off-the-shelf unit evaluation scripts, which
     meet task requirements, may be modified and used when approved by 14 AF/A3V. If
     required to attain 20-35% crew force percentages, 14 AF/A3V may observe some or all
     of the evaluations in the six months prior to the inspection visit. 14 AF/A3V will
     coordinate these evaluations with the affected organizations. Units will provide 14
     AF/A3V with crew schedules IAW 30 day out message. 14 AF/A3V will select
     crews/crewmembers to be evaluated and maintains final approval authority on evaluatees.
     Squadron/detachment commanders are required to be evaluated during all SETs.
     11.4.2.2. (Added-14 AF) 14 AF/A3V evaluators will conduct an over-the-shoulder
     observation for evaluations taking place during the SET. All phases of the evaluation
     may be observed including evaluation preparation, conduct, and follow-on administrative
     actions. Additionally, the unit will provide a 14 AF Form 6 (for each crewmember
     evaluated) to the SET for review/approval prior to outbriefing the results to the crew. 14
     AF/A3V will have final authority on all errors assessed. An assessment regarding
     evaluator performance will be determined and will contribute to the Operations Stan/Eval
     Program rating.
  11.4.3. (Added-14 AF) Mission Operations. Mission operations will be reviewed during
  scenarios, observation of real world operations (on a non-interference basis), as well as a
  review of archival information (i.e., unit logs).
  11.4.4. (Added-14 AF) 14 AF/A3V may review results of recent inspections (as applicable)
  or activities a squadron/group has been involved in to determine additional areas, if any, to
  be inspected. For example/to include:
     11.4.4.1. (Added-14 AF) Trending Program documentation or other sources, which
     identify recent training, evaluation, or operations trends.
     11.4.4.2. (Added-14 AF) Inspector General (IG) reports and other inspection-related
     reports (e.g. OST).
     11.4.4.3. (Added-14 AF) ORP minutes.
     11.4.4.4. (Added-14 AF) ORB minutes.
 66                                             AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011



11.5. (Added-14 AF) SET Inspection Results: 14 AF/A3V will out-brief final inspection
results to key leadership and staff. A draft of the formal report is provided to the unit prior to the
team’s departure. Corrections may be made during coordination before the report is published.
The report becomes official upon approval by the 14 AF/CC. The report will consist of the
following areas:
   11.5.1. (Added-14 AF) An executive summary providing the purpose of the inspection, a
   short description of the unit’s mission, overall observations of the unit, and an assessment of
   the unit’s overall mission readiness.
   11.5.2. (Added-14 AF) Section I, Unit Ratings: This area includes a rating tier definition, a
   summary of the unit’s ratings with the overall assessment, and the assessment for each area
   inspected. Sub-areas are not rated.
   11.5.3. (Added-14 AF) Section II, Assessment Findings: The unit’s write-ups are listed in
   this area. Findings are broken down into the following categories: Problems, Areas for
   Improvement, Strengths, and Commendables. Listed under each category is the category
   definition and write-ups, if any, for each mission/program area. Recommendations are
   provided as suggested courses of action for correcting Problems or Areas for Improvement.
       11.5.3.1. (Added-14 AF) Problems. Areas or programs not in compliance with
       applicable instructions or HHQ guidance. Corrective action for all problems will be
       reported in squadron and group/wing ORP minutes for tracking purposes. All identified
       problem areas will be validated with squadron or group functional areas prior to
       publishing the final report. Criticalities may be assigned to problems based on available
       checklists or the determination of the 14 AF/A3V.
       11.5.3.2. (Added-14 AF) Areas for Improvement. Areas or programs not in conflict
       with any instruction or HHQ guidance but may require further consideration.
       11.5.3.3. (Added-14 AF) Strengths. A process or activity identified by the inspection
       team that enhances the quality and effectiveness of a specific program. Team members
       will give a short description of the inspected office/section/element/personnel, if
       deserving.
       11.5.3.4. (Added-14 AF) Commendables. Programs that should be considered for
       implementation by other squadrons or groups within 14 AF.
   11.5.4. (Added-14 AF) Section III, Crew Evaluations/Mission Operations: Contains a
   summary of each observed crew evaluation or mission operation. Lists qualification rating
   by crewmember position for each evaluation with a short description of the individual’s
   performance. Observed mission operations will also be listed here.
   11.5.5. (Added-14 AF) Section IV, Training Observations: Contains a summary of each
   observed training event.
   11.5.6. (Added-14 AF) Section V, Additional Information: Identifies Outstanding
   Performers (individuals who displayed excellence while under evaluation or observations of
   mission operations.), Outstanding Contributors (individuals who displayed excellence in
   areas other than crew performance or mission operations), and any other pertinent
   information deemed necessary by 14 AF/A3V.
AFSPCI36-2202V1_14AFSUP_I 22 JULY 2011                                                       67


   11.5.7. (Added-14 AF) 14 AF/A3V distributes the report to HQ AFSPC IG/IGI, 24 AF/OV,
   NGB/IG, NGB/XO, HQ AFRC/DO, 10 AF/DOT, and associated wing/group agencies.
11.6. (Added-14 AF) LSETs. 14 AF/A3V performs limited, out of cycle inspections as
directed by the 14 AF/CC. These LSETs are conducted in a similar fashion to regular SETs, but
are limited to the areas and responsibilities specified by the 14 AF/CC.
   11.6.1. (Added-14 AF) LSETs are no-notice in nature. No messages will be sent to the unit
   until immediately prior to commencement of inspection activities. The length of the
   inspection, team composition, and scheduling of activities is dependent on the areas directed
   to be inspected.
   11.6.2. (Added-14 AF) Inspected units will receive an outbrief at the end of the inspection
   along with a draft report; however, ratings will not be assessed for the inspection.
11.7. (Added-14 AF) Staff Assistance Visits (SAV). 14 AF/A3V may perform an SAV at the
request of the wing or operations group CC. A SAV will be conducted in the same manner as a
SET, but may be smaller in scale depending on the requested focus of the visit. SAVs do not
assign ratings or criticalities. A SAV is used by the wing/operations group to evaluate their
unit's progress in achieving their stated goals. 14 AF does not consider a SAV a graded
inspection. 14 AF/A3V will attempt to fulfill all requests for SAVs based on available resources
and real world mission requirements.
   11.7.1. (Added-14 AF) SAV reports will only be distributed at the discretion of 14 AF/A3V.

Related Tasks— Events attributed to the same root cause and occurring simultaneously where
one task logically leads to another.
Scenario— Consists of a specific set of tasks presented in a coherent manner to simulate real-
world conditions and used to train and/or evaluate crew members in a crew environment to the
maximum extent possible. Scenarios are presented in an off-line simulator; however, scenarios
may be presented in a real-world environment.
Sim Switch— A support function comprised of personnel with mission or system expertise, who
interact in a realistic manner with trainees or evaluatees during a performance test. Sim Switch
is used to simulate internal and external agencies, and pass and receive event responses, as
required.
Subject Matter Expert (SME)— A person who has thorough knowledge of the material being
analyzed. He or she acts as an advisor and critic concerning subject matter during the production
and validation of training and evaluation material. A SME will be mission ready in the
respective position or another closely related position, or for newly established units, appropriate
training such as contractor-provided Type 1 training must be accomplished, if available.

                                   TEPS DEVELOPMENT

A2.1. Remove This. TEPs define the special set of skills required for mission accomplishment.
Applicable NAF-published Training and Evaluation Performance Standards (TEPS) (formerly
AFSPCI 36-2203 Volumes I and II, 14AF/20AF Training and Evaluation Performance
Standards (TEPS)) establish the minimum training and evaluation task performance standards
and provide constraints for all performance scenarios. TEPs will include all tasks/subtasks,
along with associated performance standards, conditions, proficiency codes and applicable
timing requirements.
A2.2. TEPS are the overarching guidelines detailing how to train and evaluate all the tasks
necessary for operational crew members to become and maintain mission ready status. To do
this, the NAF must develop standardized task requirements for each of their mission areas. The
below information provides assistance in developing TEPS:
   A2.2.1. Identify tasks/subtasks (TASKs) essential for mission accomplishment.
   A2.2.2. Define the task standard level (A, B, or C) for each task/subtask.
   A2.2.3. Group like tasks/subtasks and consolidate in a comprehensive task/subtask list.
   A2.2.4. For Level A tasks/subtasks (optional for Level B and C), identify the requirements
   for the task by using a set of givens/constraints, task performance requirements, and the
   standard (usually a timing requirement) for task accomplishment.
   A2.2.4. (14 AF) All tasks (Critical, Essential, and Non-essential) minimally require a
   statement of the correct performance standard. Constraints and requirements only need to be
   included for Essential and Non-essential tasks if they are necessary to ensure correct and
   standardized presentation in an evaluation environment.
A2.3. Use the sample Comprehensive Task/Subtask List and task requirements tables on the
next pages as examples only.

   A5.1.1. Instructor/Evaluator-trainee relationship.
   A5.1.2. Methods used to initiate events (e.g., status cards, telephone calls, simulation, real-
   world activity, equipment indications, etc.). All script inputs must be clearly identified as
   simulated inputs.
   A5.1.3. Responsibilities during equipment operations.
   A5.1.4. Responsibilities during actual emergencies, malfunctions, or real-world events.
   A5.1.5. External agencies, internal agencies, and crew support agencies; to include whether
   their role is actual or simulated.
