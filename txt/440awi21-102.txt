1. Policy.
   1.1. The crash recovery program is established to recover crashed, damaged and/or disabled
   aircraft in minimum time consistent with the following considerations:
       1.1.1. The requirement to open the runway for operational use.
       1.1.2. Prevention of secondary damage to the aircraft.
       1.1.3. Preservation of evidence for mishap or accident investigation.
 2                                                               440AWI21-102 24 MAY 2010


        1.1.4. Safety of personnel involved with recovery operation.
WARNING: Incidents involving aircraft made up of a composite structure may cause serious
injury or death to those in contact with it. Transient aircraft home bases should be contacted to
determine composite material risks and requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE).
CAUTION: The aircraft and crash site will be disturbed only to the extent required to eliminate
an imminently dangerous situation to the aircraft, support equipment, and personnel, and will
remain in an undisturbed state until the aircraft is released to maintenance by the on-scene
commander (OSC).
2. Procedures.
     2.1. Initial response.
        2.1.1. The Crash, Damaged, Disabled Aircraft Recovery team will respond to the
        designated holding area when called by the production supervisor. The holding area for
        runway 05 is Silver Ramp and for runway 23 is Papa Row.
        2.1.2. The CDDAR team chief will establish radio contact with the senior fire officer for
        any further instructions and monitor the fire net while maintaining radio contact with the
        Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) and applicable production superintendent,
        keeping them updated on the situation.
        2.1.3. If additional CDDAR personnel are required to recover the aircraft, the CDDAR
        Team Chief will notify the MOC and maintenance supervisor of the personnel and/or
        equipment necessary.
     2.2. Engine shut-down.
        2.2.1. When a disabled aircraft shuts down engines on the runway, the applicable
        production supervisor will determine the safest course of action to clear the aircraft off
        the runway.
        2.2.2. 440 AMXS will be prepared to tow the aircraft to final parking.
        2.2.3. If there is another emergency in progress and/or requires Crash Recovery team
        response, the production superintendent will coordinate with the MOC to address the
        situation.
     2.3. Hot brakes.
        2.3.1. When hot brakes are declared, the applicable production superintendent will
        proceed to the aircraft when directed by the senior fire officer.
        2.3.2. The base fire department will approach the wheel from either front or rear,
        depending on aircraft configuration in order to obtain an accurate temperature reading of
        the brake assembly.
        2.3.3. In accordance with TO 4B-1-1, Use of Landing Wheel Brakes and Wheels During
        Ground Operations, do not attempt to determine brake temperature using mechanical
        items such as melt sticks or chemical pencils.
        2.3.4. There is no identified temperature in tech data for hot brakes, however TO 4W1-4-
        1013 lists the tire fuse plug melting point at 390 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature
        that is considered safe is 350 degrees Fahrenheit or less.
440AWI21-102 24 MAY 2010                                                                       3


       2.3.5. If hot brakes are determined, all non-essential personnel will be withdrawn a
       minimum of 300 feet and a 30-minute cool down period will begin.
       2.3.6. If the parking brake is set (upon approval from the senior fire officer) ensure the
       aircraft is sufficiently chocked and release the parking brake. The purpose of this is to
       prevent the brake from seizing.
           2.3.6.1. If at the end of the 30-minute cool down period, the brakes are still hot, an
           additional 15-minute cool down period will begin until the brakes are determined
           safe.
           2.3.6.2. When the brakes temperature has cooled to safe levels, set the parking brake.
           After a thorough inspection and the brakes are determined safe, the aircraft can be
           moved to another location.
   2.4. Blown tire(s).
       2.4.1. In the event one or both main/nose tires are blown on the runway, the Crash
       Recovery Team will assemble.
           2.4.1.1. When directed by the on-scene senior fire officer, install new wheel and tire
           assemblies.
           2.4.1.2. When the aircraft is deemed safe to tow, the Crash Recovery Team will tow
           the aircraft clear of the runway.
   2.5. Other CDDAR responses.
       2.5.1. Prepare to immediately assemble a tow team if aircraft towing is directed by the
       OSC to remove surrounding aircraft away from the crash site.
       2.5.2. Accomplish applicable checklists (see attachments 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10)
   2.6. Safety precautions will not be abandoned to expedite removal of disabled or damaged
   aircraft.
3. Responsibilities.
   3.1. 440 MXS Aerospace Repair Section will:
       3.1.1. Ensure provisions of this instruction are applied and maintained in current status
       IAW with associated maintenance directives.
       3.1.2. Ensure a qualified CDDAR team chief, identified in writing by 440 MXG/CC, is
       available during all hours of operation.
       3.1.3. Be responsible for the overall CDDAR program management and application at
       Pope AFB.
       3.1.4. Coordinate with the MOC regarding any shortages of CDDAR personnel or
       equipment.
       3.1.5. Ensure a sufficient number of personnel are qualified in CDDAR procedures and
       documented. Training will encompass both academic and hands-on training.
           3.1.5.1. Ensure CDDAR team members meet minimum CDDAR training
           requirements.
 4                                                          440AWI21-102 24 MAY 2010


      3.1.6. Ensure all necessary equipment is maintained and ready for CDDAR operations.
      All equipment inspections will be accomplished IAW applicable TOs and owner’s
      manuals. Inspections will be tracked and documented in G081.
NOTE: Operational risk management is paramount in all decision-making.
