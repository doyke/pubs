This instruction applies to all personnel assigned to Andersen Air Force Base (AFB) including associate
units.
This instruction implements and integrates the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) as it
applies to command and control procedures at the wing leadership level. All the terms and AFIMS hierar-
chy are now included in this instruction. Refer to Attachment 11 for the Battle Staff and ICC nomencla-
ture comparison.
The instruction also implements procedures required by AFI 10-207, Command Posts. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
this manual, and are disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil. Contact supporting records managers as required.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Changes to 36 AEWI 10-207, Battle Staff Procedures and Functions include a name change to the main
document as well as a complete rewrite to incorporate the associated Air Force Incident Management Sys-
tem terms and procedures and remove the term “Battle Staff” from the document. Procedures are also
changed to reflect a functional organization for the Installation Control Center (ICC) operation, removing
the Contingency Support Staff and placing functional experts in the ICC to support the commander. Unit
commanders are no longer associated as primary members of the ICC, however they may be invited by
their respective group commanders in specific situations, as required. Finally, due to the numerous
changes and additions to this document a thorough review of the entire instruction is required.

1. Introduction.
   1.1. General. The purpose of the 36 WG Installation Control Center is to manage all 36 WG and
   Andersen AFB activities during periods of increased readiness, emergencies, or disaster situations to
   attain and maintain 24-hour operations, or any other situation as deemed necessary by the 36 WG
   Commander.
   1.2. The purpose of the Installation Control Center is:
      1.2.1. To provide timely and accurate information to assist wing leadership in its decision making.
      1.2.2. To manage wing activities including the allocation, mobilization, and generation of
      resources.
      1.2.3. To coordinate with higher headquarters and lateral/subordinate units to resolve problems or
      clarify taskings, responsibilities, and situational operating parameters.
      1.2.4. To compile and submit all required operational and status reports through Command Post
      (CP).
      1.2.5. To maintain an installation view of all incidents (military and civil) involving the base and
      serve as the focal point for base-wide notifications.
   1.3. Once activated, the Installation Control Center functions as the preeminent coordinating and
   decision-making activity in the wing. All other agencies, (Command Post, Emergency Operations
   Center, etc.) are subordinate to and will support the Installation Control Center.
   1.4. Installation Control Center positions will be manned at all times by the commander/chief or des-
   ignated representative unless released by the 36 WG/CC.

2. Organization.
   2.1. Composition. The Installation Control Center consists of three entities, the Commander’s Senior
   Staff, the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) and the Emergency Communications Center.
      2.1.1. The Commander’s Senior Staff will serve as the top governing organization within the ICC
      and will be led by the 36 WG/CC or his designated representative.
          2.1.1.1. The primary Commander’s Senior Staff is composed of personnel or their designated
          representatives listed in Table 1.

Command Chief Master Sergeant (CCM)               Installation Control Center Administrator (ICCA)

               2.1.1.1.1. Group CCs (or equivalents) will assemble/utilize any appropriate additional
               personnel, as the situation dictates, to provide the appropriate information to the ICC com-
               mander in a timely manner.
           2.1.1.2. The extended Commander’s Senior Staff is designated by the 36 WG/CC and will
           provide information, as required. The extended Commander’s Senior Staff is composed of, but
           not limited to, the personnel listed in Table 2.

Table 2. Extended Commander’s Senior Staff
Information Operations Rep (36 OSS/IO)                      Weather Representative (36 OSS/OSW)
Communication Squadron Commander (36 CS/CC)                 Intelligence Representative (36 OSS/IN)
Chief, Current Operations Flt (MPC)                         Inspector General (36 WG/IG)
Logistics Readiness Squadron CC (36 LRS/CC)                 AFOSI Representative (DET 602)

       2.1.2. The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) directs and supports the base response to inci-
       dents and crises on-base and off-base. This piece of the ICC will be stood up as directed by the 36
       WG/CC or his designated representative.
       2.1.3. The Emergency Communication Center (ECC) is the 24-hour communications capability
       for the EOC and will stand-up as required to support EOC operations. This entity does not replace
       the 36 Wing Command Post as the primary conduit of information flow from higher headquarters
       to the 36th Wing.
       2.1.4. Other wing units, as well as tenant units, will have personnel that can respond to taskings as
       the situation dictates during prolonged periods of Installation Control Center operations.
    2.2. Group Control Centers and/or Unit Control Centers (GCCs and UCCs). The Installation Control
    Center must be able to quickly disseminate information to all units for events such as Force Protection
    Condition (FPCON) changes, generation actions, emergency response actions, and natural disaster
    coordination. To facilitate this positive control of forces, each group must maintain the capability to
    operate a 24-hour control center when directed to do so. Furthermore, each unit should be ready to
ANDERSENAFBI10-207 21 MARCH 2007                                                                       5


   establish a UCC following a wing pyramid recall. The organization and personnel required to operate
   GCCs and/or UCCs is at the discretion of the group commanders.
   2.3. There are four additional entities that are key to the ICC’s success in all situations; the Emer-
   gency Support Function (ESF), the Deployment/Reception Control Center (DRCC), the Threat Work-
   ing Group (TWG), and the Information Operations Working Group (IOWG). They will be stood-up
   either together with the Installation Control Center or on their own, as directed by the 36 WG/CC or
   his designated representative.
      2.3.1. Emergency Support Function (ESF). The ESF may be recalled in the event of a disaster and
      is composed of 15 functions ranging across the spectrum of incident commander needs (see
      Attachment 12). The primary purpose of the ESF is to provide technical expertise to the incident
      commander. Additionally, the ESF will serve as the bridge between response resources both on
      and off base. The ESFs will assemble either at the location on-scene or another predetermined
      location based on the recommendation from the IC and the ICC. See Figure 1. for a Functional
      Org Chart/Information Flow diagram.
      2.3.2. Deployment/Reception Control Center (DRCC). The DRCC is the installation focal point
      for identifying, validating and distributing information regarding deployment/reception execution.
      Recommended DRCC positions include Installation Deployment Officer (IDO), Logistics Plans,
      Personnel, Transportation, Deployment Sequence of Events (DSOE) Monitors, Supply, Admin,
      Pre/Final-Load Planning, runners, and selected unit representatives. Further requirements and
      responsibilities are outlined in AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution. See Figure 1.
      for a Functional Org Chart/Information Flow diagram.
      2.3.3. Threat Working Group (TWG). The TWG may be called upon to advise the ICC when a
      threat (real or perceived) exists to wing operations. The TWG is chaired by the Anti-Terrorism
      officer and is comprised of the members listed in Table 3.:

Table 3. Threat Working Group Members
Anti-Terrorism (AT)             Intelligence                                     AFOSI

Information Assurance (IA)      Public Health Emergency Officer (PHEO)           Civil Engineering

          2.3.3.1. The primary locations for TWG assembly are the Command Post (during contingen-
          cies) or Security Forces (during peacetime). See Figure 1. for a Functional Org Chart/Infor-
          mation Flow diagram.
      2.3.4. Information Operations Working Group (IOWG). The IOWG may be called upon by the
      wing commander to assist in the protection (or exploitation) of information. The three Information
      Operations concepts are Information-in-Warfare, Offensive Counter Information and Defensive
      Counter Information. A member from Operations will typically serve as chair to the group. The
      IOWG is comprised of the primary functions listed in Table 4.

   36 MXG, 36 MSG, 36 MDG, 36 CRG, 36 WG/CP, and ICC Director. Other positions listed in para-
   graphs 2.1.1.1. and 2.1.1.2. will maintain personnel on call to respond to taskings.
   4.2. Each ICC member will be provided checklists that address actions for potential taskings, contin-
   gencies and incidents. These checklists will be tailored for each contingency and coordinated with all
   affected base agencies. The key is to ensure all ICC members perform necessary critical actions dur-
   ing any contingency.
      4.2.1. Each unit is responsible for maintaining any unit-specific checklists or reference docu-
      ments. The OPR for the Contingency/FPCON checklists is 36 SFS.
      4.2.2. ICC checklists will be updated as changes occur, and reviewed semiannually. Subordinate

5. Installation Control Center Operations.
   5.1. Notification and Reporting. Installation Control Center members will be notified of an ICC acti-
   vation either through a pyramid recall or an ICC recall IAW 36 AEWI 10-202, Pyramid Recall Proce-
   dures.
      5.1.1. During a pyramid recall, ICC members will be notified through their normal pyramid recall
      methods. ICC members will report to the Installation Control Center area in the CP as soon as pos-
      sible unless directed otherwise.
      5.1.2. During an ICC only recall, the members will be notified of either a “Primary” or “Full” ICC
      recall. Members will report to the Installation Control Center (Building 23028) as soon as possible
      unless directed otherwise. Personnel required for each Installation Control Center recall are:
18                                                          ANDERSENAFBI10-207 21 MARCH 2007


            5.1.2.1. Primary: Primary ICC members are the Commander’s Senior Staff as depicted in
            paragraph 2.1.1.1.
            5.1.2.2. Full: Incorporates the Commander’s Senior Staff and the extended Commander’s
            Senior Staff (listed in paragraph 2.1.1.2.), and other personnel as directed by 36 WG/CC.
        5.1.3. Only the individual on-call for each position will be notified directly by Command Post
        based on the type of recall. The on-call person will immediately report to the ICC for operations.
        Should operations be expected to extend beyond normal duty periods, a secondary (or alternate)
        person will be contacted and shifts developed accordingly.
        5.1.4. Once recalled, members will gather, take appropriate immediate actions, and assist other
        members as required. Members arriving first must be prepared to function without the assistance
        of the entire ICC present.
        5.1.5. The seating chart with phone numbers for the primary ICC location can be found in
        Attachment 1; the secondary ICC location can be found in Attachment 2; and the tertiary ICC
        location can be found in Attachment 3.
     5.2. Briefings. Briefings provide facts and information necessary for effective decision-making of the
     ICC Commander. They are designed to make the commander and Commander’s Senior Staff aware of
     higher headquarters taskings, current status of unit resources, actions required to implement war or
     deployment plans, and limitations which may deter expeditious accomplishment of required tasks.
     ICC briefings fall into the following three categories:
        5.2.1. Initial Situation Assessment. This briefing will allow ICC members to determine what the
        situation is and what immediate actions are required (see Attachment 8 for worksheet). This will
        be an informal briefing and may or may not include a situation briefing slide presentation.
        5.2.2. Initial ICC Briefing. This briefing is a formal presentation of the situation. The time of the
        briefing will be established by the 36 WG/CC. The briefing content will include as a minimum
        (see Attachment 9):
            5.2.2.1. Reason ICC was activated.
            5.2.2.2. Required actions and their current status.
            5.2.2.3. Intelligence.
            5.2.2.4. Weather.
            5.2.2.5. Limiting factors (i.e. operations, maintenance, support).
            5.2.2.6. Commander comments.
        5.2.3. Update Briefings. Update briefings will be scheduled as required by the commander but
        normally at 12-hour intervals. Briefings should provide a summary of major events, changes in
        status since the previous briefing, anticipated actions or taskings, and unresolved problems. Brief-
        ings will be tailored to the given situation. Additional briefings of supplemental information may
        be added at a time set by the Installation Control Center Commander.
        5.2.4. The ICC Director is normally the designated lead briefer. Portions of the briefing will be
        turned over to individual experts (e.g. weather, intelligence, AFOSI, group commanders, etc.) as
        required.
ANDERSENAFBI10-207 21 MARCH 2007                                                                     19


  5.3. Information Flow. The following procedures will be used to ensure the efficient flow of informa-
  tion to and through the ICC to enhance problem resolution, and provide proper coordination during
  ICC operations.
     5.3.1. When a ICC member receives an input, gather as much of the following information as pos-
     sible:
         5.3.1.1. Type of input (real world or exercise).
         5.3.1.2. Classification of input (Unclassified, Confidential, Secret or Top Secret). Top Secret
         inputs will not be handled in the ICC cab. All Top Secret inputs will be handled directly with
         the ICC Commander inside the Command Post cab.
         5.3.1.3. Point of origin of input. Obtain name and telephone number of person submitting
         input.
         5.3.1.4. Actual verbiage of input. If input is exercise, obtain actual wording from input card.
         If received over the telephone, write exact message down.
     5.3.2. Once an input has been received, pass all information to the ICC Director. This can be done
     verbally or by use of an “INFOGRAM” (Attachment 7). “INFOGRAMs” are used to document
     and track inputs/required actions, help focus ICC attention on input/issues, and formally tasks an
     OPR for resolution of the problem.
     5.3.3. Brief the input as soon as possible. The ICC Director must weigh the relative importance/
     priority of the specific input and decide whether to override other ICC actions. The following pro-
     cedure will be used when briefing an input:
         5.3.3.1. Fill out the INFOGRAM describing the input/situation to be briefed. INFOGRAMs
         do not have to be filled out completely to be briefed.
         5.3.3.2. Ring the ICC bell and announce whether the input is classified or unclassified. Allow
         time for members to conclude conversations and be quiet for the briefing.
         5.3.3.3. ICC Director or the appropriate ICC member will brief the input/situation quickly and
         make recommendations on immediate courses of action and/or checklists required.
         5.3.3.4. ICC Director will lead the ICC through the appropriate checklists.
         5.3.3.5. Complete the INFOGRAM with as much information as possible and archive accord-
         ingly.
  5.4. ICC Directives. When written guidance of ICC decisions must be disseminated to subordinate
  agencies (i.e. GCCs, and UCCs), members will use the Installation Control Center Directive (Attach-
  ment 6). EXCEPTION: FPCON/ INFOCON changes will use the previously accepted matrices.
  5.5. Relocation Procedures.
     5.5.1. General. Relocation could occur due to events which result in a hazard to personnel (such
     as power outages, bomb threats, fire, etc.) or possible loss of command and control over assigned
     forces. The ICC Commander will determine when relocation is necessary and to which location.
     The secondary location is Building 18006. The tertiary location is Building 25002, room 21
     (Guam Area Air Defense Control Center). If time and conditions permit, complete all checklists
     items and inform subordinate control centers of the relocation.
20                                                            ANDERSENAFBI10-207 21 MARCH 2007


        5.5.2. Procedures.
            5.5.2.1. All personnel are responsible for securing their classified material and carrying their
            checklists as well as required items to the alternate facility. NOTE: STU-III/STE terminals are
            present at the alternate sites.
            5.5.2.2. The primary and alternate exit routes from the Installation Control Center will be
            briefed as required by the ICC Director. Security Forces will clear the route to the relocation
            facility and report back that the route is clear.
            5.5.2.3. Time permitting, a small contingent will proceed to the selected alternate facility and
            ensure connectivity is possible. Upon determination the facility has connectivity; the senior
            ranking individual will notify the remainder of ICC to proceed.
            5.5.2.4. The convoy will assemble in the MSG building parking lot and proceed to the alter-
            nate facility as quickly as possible. 36 SFS personnel will provide escort.
            5.5.2.5. The on duty CP controller will accompany the ICC commander to provide command
            and control capability. All other personnel will join the convoy as directed by the checklist.
            5.5.2.6. Upon arriving at the alternate location, SFS will sweep the entrance into the building
            unless accomplished previously by the initial contingent security forces. Once clear, SFS will
            notify the ICC members to proceed to the designated room.
     5.6. Post Generation Installation Control Center Requirements:
        5.6.1. During the post generation/reconfiguration and regeneration phase, the ICC will be manned
        (as a minimum) by the following representatives (or as directed):
            5.6.1.1. 36 OG representative
            5.6.1.2. 36 MXG representative
            5.6.1.3. 36 SFS representative
        5.6.2. The ICC will remain in session until all weapons have been safely returned to the Muni-
        tions Storage Area.

6. Training.
     6.1. General. Effective, thorough, and recurring training is essential to attain the high levels of readi-
     ness required for ICC operations. Training will be given to all personnel assigned to the ICC.
     6.2. The ICC Director for Training (ICCD-T) will establish and maintain a training plan for personnel
     assigned to the ICC. The Senior ICC Director (ICCD-S) is responsible for notifying the ICCD-T of
     new personnel who require ICC orientation and/or training.
     6.3. Types of training
        6.3.1. Initial ICC Training. Initial training focuses on orientation to ICC operations and will be
        provided to all new ICC members. Initial training will, as a minimum, consist of the following
        subjects:
            6.3.1.1. Positional roles and responsibilities.
            6.3.1.2. ICC recall/activation and relocation procedures.
ANDERSENAFBI10-207 21 MARCH 2007                                                                       21


          6.3.1.3. Security procedures (FPCONs, INFOCONs, OPSEC, COMSEC, etc.)
          6.3.1.4. Communications systems, office systems, and computer software, to include fax,
          STU-III/STE, SIPRNET, display and intercom capabilities etc., as appropriate.
          6.3.1.5. Governing directives to include AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Manage-
          ment(EM) Program Planning and Operations; Full Spectrum Threat Response; AFI 10-206,
          Operational Reporting; AFI 10-207, Command Post; and AAFBI 10-207, Installation Control
          Center Procedures and Functions.
          6.3.1.6. Wing OPlans and contingency plans.
          6.3.1.7. Operations procedures to include information flow, briefing flow, and checklist usage.
          6.3.1.8. Reporting procedures to include OPREPs and SITREPs.
      6.3.2. Recurring ICC Training. Recurring training will be scheduled bi-monthly, at a minimum.
      Training topics will be designed so that all wing taskings and ICC operations are reviewed annu-
      ally. If possible, training should be scenario driven and increase the proficiency of the members.
      Wing-level exercises may fulfill the training requirement at the discretion of the wing commander.

7. Administrative.
   7.1. Appointment to ICC duties. All commanders and functional area chiefs listed in 2.1.1.1. and
   2.1.1.2. are designated as primary ICC representatives. Additional representatives must be assigned in
   writing by the appropriate commander or functional chief. See Attachment 10 for an example
   appointment letter. Failure to accomplish this may result in an unnecessary delay to access the appro-
   priate ICC information during actual operations.
   7.2. ICC Manning Concept. Although only one ICCC and ICCA is on call, extreme contingency sit-
   uations or natural disaster responses that involve consistently heavy GCC/UCC interaction, TBMCS
   entries, and multiple taskings will require a second ICCC on duty. The ICCD makes this determina-
   tion based on anticipated workload and will coordinate a schedule accordingly.
   7.3. Installation Control Center Security.
      7.3.1. All assigned ICC and support members will possess, at a minimum, a SECRET security
      clearance and display a current restricted area badge (AF Form 1199) with area “4” open. Person-
      nel requiring temporary access must possess a clearance commensurate with the briefing level,
      display a visitor badge, and be escorted while in the ICC area IAW escort procedures below. 36
      WG/CP is the signature authority for area “4” and escort privileges.
      7.3.2. During normal operations, entry to the ICC is controlled by on-duty command post (CP)
      controllers. During pyramid or ICC recalls, Command Post personnel will initially control entry
      into CP. Security Forces Control Center will dispatch a guard to the CP immediately upon pyramid
      recall notification or when directed by CP controllers. The guard will remain on duty until relieved
      by another security forces guard. This position will be manned until ICC operations are terminated
      or the guard is no longer required.
   7.4. Escort Procedures.
22                                                          ANDERSENAFBI10-207 21 MARCH 2007


        7.4.1. When arriving at the CP with the person to be escorted, the escort official and escortee will
        proceed to the waiting area, present the appropriate credentials to the guard and request access.
        The guard will verify the credentials and then allow access to the escort and escortee.
        7.4.2. If the escort official is already inside the CP when the escortee arrives, the escort official
        must vouch for the escortee to the entry controller before the escortee is allowed entry.
        7.4.3. The escort official will sign the individual in on an AF Form 1109, Visitors Register and the
        entry controller will issue an “Escort Required” badge to the escortee. The escort is now responsi-
        ble for actions of the escortee and will not let the escortee out of sight.
        7.4.4. Escort duties may be turned over to someone with an open area “4” on their restricted area
        badge.
        7.4.5. Before departure, the escortee will turn in the visitor badge to the entry controller and the
        escort will ensure the visitor is signed out on the Visitors Register.
     7.5. Access Requirements.
        7.5.1. Computer Access. All personnel assigned to perform ICC duties must have access to either
        a personal or group SIPRNET account. Individuals requiring a personal account will submit a DD
        Form 2875, Special Authorization Access Request to 36 CS Help Desk to activate the account. 36
        WG/ICCD-T will ensure personnel have access to required shared drives and e-mail accounts.
        Submit any requests to 36 WG/ICCD-T for inclusion.

A14.2. Terms defined.


Air Force Career Field Managers (AFCFM)—Enlisted AFCFMs are typically CMSgts serving at
Headquarters Air Force who are responsible for organizing and managing one or more enlisted career
fields. Their responsibilities include establishing career field entry requirements, managing trained per-
sonnel requirements and manning, as well as developing and managing career-long training plans'
requirements and programs.


Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program—The single, integrated Air Force program to
coordinate and organize efforts to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the direct
and indirect consequences of an emergency or attack. The primary missions of the Air Force EM program
are to (1) save lives, (2) minimize the loss or degradation of resources, and (3) continue, sustain, and
restore combat and combat support operational capability in an all-hazards physical threat environment at
Air Force installations worldwide. The ancillary missions of the Air Force EM program are to support
homeland defense and civil support operations and to provide support to civil and host nation authorities
IAW DOD directives and through the appropriate Combatant Command. The Air Force EM program is
managed by the Office of The Civil Engineer, AF/A7C.


Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS)—A methodology designed to incorporate the
requirements of HSPD-5, the NIMS, the NRP, and OSD guidance while preserving the unique military
requirements of the expeditionary Air Force. AFIMS provides the Air Force with an incident management
system that is consistent with the single, comprehensive approach to domestic incident management.
AFIMS provides the Air Force with the coordinating structures, processes, and protocols required to inte-
grate its specific authorities into the collective framework of Federal departments and agencies for action
to include mitigation, prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery activities. It includes a core set of
concepts, principles, terminology, and technologies covering the incident command system, EOCs, inci-
dent command, training, identification and management of resources, qualification and certification, and
the collection, tracking and reporting of incident information and incident resources. The AFIMS method-
ology is incorporated into current operating practices through revised instructions and manuals, training
products, and exercise and evaluation tools.


Antiterrorism (AT)—Defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and property to
terrorist acts, to include limited response and containment by local military and civilian forces. See also
AFI 10-245.


Area of Responsibility (AOR)—The geographical area associated with a COCOM within which a com-
batant commander has authority to plan and conduct operations.

Awareness—The continual process of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence, information,
and knowledge to allow organizations and individuals to anticipate requirements and to react effectively.


Bare Base—A base having minimum essential facilities to house, sustain, and support operations to
include, if required, a stabilized runway, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas. A bare base must have a
source of water that can be made potable. Other requirements to operate under bare base conditions form
a necessary part of the force package deployed to the bare base.


Biological Agent—A microorganism that causes disease in personnel, plants, or animals or causes the
deterioration of material.


Biological Threat—A threat that consists of biological material planned to be deployed to produce casu-
alties in personnel or animals or damage plants.

killing or harming persons, useful animals or plants.
Biological Weapon (BW)—An item of material that projects, disperses, or disseminates a biological
agent including arthropod vectors.


CBRN—Operations that include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear, either individually or in
combination. Collectively known as WMD, CBRN replaces "NBC" when used in reference to operations
or incidents limited to NBC-only issues. TIC/TIM and HAZMAT are considered part of the "C" in
"CBRN."


CBRNE—Operations or incidents involving chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield
explosives, either individually or in combination. "CBRNE" is used anytime that reference is not being
made to WMD operations or incidents.


CBRNE Environment—condition of warfare in which an adversary possesses or uses chemical, biolog-
ical, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosive weapons, by-products, infrastructure, and associated
delivery methods.


CBRNE Hazard—Those CBRNE elements that pose or could pose a hazard to individuals. CBRNE haz-
ards include those created from accidental realizes, TIM (especially air and water poisons), biological
pathogens, radioactive matter, and high-yield explosives. Also included are any hazards resulting from the
deliberate employment of WMD during military operations.
ANDERSENAFBI10-207 21 MARCH 2007                                                                          51


CBRNE High Threat Area (HTA)—Friendly forces in these areas are at high risk for attack with
CBRNE weapons by states and non-state actors, such as terrorists and criminals also known as transna-
tionals. Potential adversaries within the region either possess or are likely to possess a substantial stock-
pile of CBRNE weapons and weapons systems and may have special operations forces capable of
conducting sustained attacks on airbases. Actual or potential transnational threats exist during peacetime
or wartime. Forces are within immediate strike range of adversary theater missiles, and CBRNE strikes
using these weapons are assumed to be likely to occur. Air Force personnel and units in or deployed to
these locations will be organized, trained, exercised, and equipped to survive CBRNE attacks and conduct
sustained combat operations in CBRNE environments.


CBRNE Low Threat Area (LTA)—Friendly forces in these areas are at risk for attack with CBRNE
weapons by transnationals. Actual or potential transnational threats exist during peacetime or wartime.
Select personnel (see paragraphs 2.4.2.6. and 2.4.2.7.) and other personnel identified in CEMP 10-2 are
organized, trained, and equipped to continue critical missions and restore the primary mission. All other
personnel in these locations are trained to survive attacks.


CBRNE Medium Threat Area (MTA)—Friendly forces in these areas are at medium risk for attack with
CBRNE weapons by states and non-state actors, such as terrorists and criminals also known as transna-
tionals. Potential adversaries within the region either possess or are likely to possess CBRNE weapons
and weapons systems and may also have special operations forces capable of conducting limited attacks
on airbases. Actual or potential transnational threats exist during peacetime or wartime. Forces may be
within the extended range of adversary theater missiles, but it is assessed that CBRNE strikes using these
weapons are less likely to occur. Air Force personnel and units in or deployed to these locations will be
organized, trained, exercised, and equipped to survive CBRNE attacks and to conduct limited combat
operations in CBRNE environments.


Chemical Agent—Any toxic chemical intended for use in military operations.


Chemical Operations—Employment of chemical agents to kill, injure, or incapacitate for a significant
period of time, personnel or animals, and deny or hinder the use of areas, facilities or material; or defense
against employment of chemical agents.


Chemical Warfare (CW)—All aspects of military operations involving the employment of lethal and
incapacitating munitions or agents and the warning and protective measures associated with such offen-
sive operations. Because riot control agents and herbicides are not considered chemical warfare agents,
those two items will be referred to separately or under the broader term "chemical," which will be used to
include all types of chemical munitions or agents collectively.

        of those chemicals specified in (a) which would be released as a result of the employment of such
        munition or device;
     c. any equipment specifically designed for use directly in connection with the employment of muni-
        tions or devices specified in (b).


Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Operation—A collective term used only when referring to a
combined chemical, biological, and radiological operation.

Cold Zone—This area contains the command post and such other support functions as are deemed neces-
sary to control the incident. The zone encompassing the warm zone used to carry out all other support
functions of the incident. Workers in the cold zone are not required to wear personal protective clothing
because the zone is considered safe. The MEOC, the IC staging area, and the triage or treatment area are
located within the cold zone.


Combating Terrorism—Actions, including AT (defensive measures taken to reduce vulnerability to ter-
rorist acts) and counterterrorism (offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, and respond to terrorism),
taken to oppose terrorism throughout the entire threat spectrum.


Command and Control (C2)—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated com-
mander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. C2 functions are per-
formed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications, facilities, and procedures
employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in
the accomplishment of the mission.


Command Post (CP)—A unit or sub-unit’s headquarters where the commander and the staff perform
their activities. In combat, a unit or sub-unit’s headquarters is often divided into echelons.
ANDERSENAFBI10-207 21 MARCH 2007                                                                           53


Commander’s Senior Staff—A C2 function normally activated for a specific incident to oversee the
mission operation of the installation. The Commander’s Senior Staff is scalable to support the ICC and
coordinate with the EOC. (Note: Do not abbreviate as "CSS".)


Common Operating Picture (COP)—A single identical display of relevant information shared by more
than one command. A COP facilitates collaborative planning and assists all echelons to achieve situa-
tional awareness.


Confirmatory Identification—The determination of a CBRNE material or pathogen’s identity to the
specificity and confidence required to meet all objectives of the incident recovery.


Consequence Management (CM)—Actions taken to maintain or restore essential services and manage
and mitigate problems resulting from disasters and catastrophes, including natural, manmade, or terrorist
incidents.


Contamination—1. The deposit, absorption, or adsorption of radioactive material or of biological or
chemical agents on or by structures, areas, personnel, or objects, or in aerosolized clouds. 2. (DOD only)
Food or water made unfit for consumption by humans or animals because of the presence of environmen-
tal chemicals, radioactive elements, bacteria, or organisms, the by-product of the growth of bacteria or
organisms, the decomposing material (to include the food substance itself) or waste in the food or water.


Contamination Control Area—A area in which contaminated IPE is removed; people, equipment, and
supplies are decontaminated to allow processing between a toxic environment and a toxic free area; the
last area an individual can safely don IPE before moving into a contaminated area.


Contamination Control Station—An area specifically designated for allowing ingress and egress of per-
sonnel and equipment to or from the hazards area. The outer boundary of the CCS is the CCL, and the
inner boundary is the line segment labeled the hot line.


Contingency—An emergency involving military forces caused by natural disasters, terrorists, subver-
sives, or by required military operations. Due to the uncertainty of the situation, contingencies require
plans, rapid response and special procedures to ensure the safety and readiness of personnel, installations,
and equipment.

Contingency Operations Costs—These are the incremental costs that would not be incurred if the con-
tingency operation were not being carried out.


Continuity of Operations (COOP)—The degree or state of being continuous in the conduct of func-
tions, tasks, or duties necessary to accomplish a military action or mission in carrying out the national mil-
54                                                          ANDERSENAFBI10-207 21 MARCH 2007


itary strategy. It includes the functions and duties of the commander as well as the supporting functions
and duties performed by the staff and others acting under the authority and direction of the commander.


Control Zones—The areas at a HAZMAT incident that are designated based upon safety and the degree
of hazard.


Conventional Explosive Attack—Conventional explosives are compounds or mixtures (such as ammo-
nium nitrate, TNT, or plastic explosives) that create blast and cause fragmentation when detonated. Mili-
tary munitions and IEDs use conventional explosives. The vast majority of attacks involving conventional
explosives are simply conventional explosive attacks. "High-Yield Explosive" (HYE), is a term used to
further delineate conventional explosives and is defined by DOD as: any conventional [explosive]
weapon or device that is capable of a high order of destruction or disruption and/or of being used in such
a manner as to kill or injure large numbers of people. (HYE is the E in CBRNE.)." Note that HYE is sim-
ilar to the term "WMD" – it refers to a weapon or device, and the method in which it is used so that it kills
a large number of people. The key for HYE is how the device is constructed and employed. For purposes
of planning protective measures, the CJCS (CJCSI 3435.01) further clarified HYE as a device or incident
involving: (1) the use of a conventional explosive weapon in conjunction with a CBRN component or (2)
the terrorist use of a conventional weapon or explosive device in such a manner to inflict a large number
of casualties. Examples include a vehicle-borne IED parked adjacent to a hospital, or an explosive device
placed strategically on an aircraft. The term "explosive" or "conventional explosive" includes the term
"HYE" unless specifically noted.


Conventional Weapon—A weapon that is not chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear.


Cordon—A physical barrier surrounding the incident scene where controls are established to preclude
unauthorized entry.


Critical Infrastructures—Systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States
that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security,
national economic security, national public health or safety or any combination of those matters.


Decontamination—The process of making any person, object, or area safe by absorbing, destroying,
neutralizing, making harmless, or removing chemical or biological agents, or by removing radioactive
material clinging to or around it.


Decontamination Corridor—The area usually located within the warm zone where decontamination
procedures take place. (Also known as the contamination reduction corridor.) (NFPA Standard 471)
ANDERSENAFBI10-207 21 MARCH 2007                                                                          55

forces, DOD civilians and DOD contractor personnel, and DOD agencies and components, for domestic
emergencies and for designated law enforcement and other activities.


Deployment—1. In naval usage, the change from a cruising approach or contact disposition to a disposi-
tion for battle. 2. The movement of forces within operational areas. 3. The positioning of forces into a for-
mation for battle. 4. The relocation of forces and material to desired operational areas. Deployment
encompasses all activities from origin or home station through destination, specifically including
intra-continental United States, inter-theater, and intra-theater movement legs, staging, and holding areas.


Detection—In CBRNE environments, the act of locating CBRNE hazards by use of CBRNE detectors or
monitoring or survey teams.


Disaster Response Force (DRF)—The Air Force structure that responds to disasters or accidents, estab-
lishing C2 and supporting disaster operations.

DOD Resources—Military and civilian personnel, including National Guard members and Reservists of
the Military Services, and facilities, equipment, supplies, and services owned by, controlled by or under
the jurisdiction of a DOD component.


Domestic Emergencies—Emergencies affecting the public welfare and occurring within the 50 States,
District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, US possessions, and territories or any political sub-
division thereof, as a result of enemy attack, insurrection, civil disturbance, earthquake, fire, flood, or
other public disasters or equivalent emergencies that endanger life and property or disrupt the usual pro-
cess of government. The term domestic emergency includes any or all of the emergency conditions
defined below:


   a. Civil defense emergency. A domestic emergency disaster situation resulting from devastation cre-
      ated by an enemy attack and requiring emergency operations during and following that attack. It
      may be proclaimed by appropriate authority in anticipation of an attack.
   b. Civil disturbances. Riots, acts of violence, insurrections, unlawful obstructions or assemblages, or
      other disorders prejudicial to public law and order. The term civil disturbance includes all domes-
      tic conditions requiring or likely to require the use of Federal Armed Forces pursuant to the provi-
      sions of Chapter 15 of Title 10, USC.
   c. Major disaster. Any flood, fire, hurricane, tornado, earthquake, or other catastrophe which, in the
      determination of the President, is or threatens to be of sufficient severity and magnitude to war-

        58) to supplement the efforts and available resources of State and local governments in alleviating
        the damage, hardship, or suffering caused thereby.
     d. Natural disaster. All domestic emergencies except those created as a result of enemy attack or
        civil disturbance.


Emergency Decontamination—The physical process of immediately reducing contamination of individ-
uals in potentially life-threatening situations with or without the formal establishment of a decontamina-
tion corridor. (NFPA 471) Note: The EPA does not require runoff control when a process is used to save
lives or reduce injury.


Emergency Operations Center (EOC)—For the purposes of AFIMS, the EOC is the C2 support ele-
ments that directs, monitors, and supports the installation’s actions before, during, and after an incident.
The EOC is activated and recalled as necessary by the Installation Commander. The EOC updates the ICC
with ongoing incident status and seeks support through the ICC when on-scene requirements surpass the
installation’s inherent capability and the installation’s cumulative capabilities acquired through MAAs.
EOCs may also support MCS and joint information activities. According to the NRP, the EOC is defined
as "The physical location at which the coordination of information and resources to support attack
response and incident management activities normally takes place. An EOC may be a temporary facility
or may be located in a more central or permanently established facility, perhaps at a higher level of orga-
nization within a jurisdiction. EOCs may be organized by major functional disciplines such as fire, law
enforcement, and medical services, by jurisdiction such as Federal, State, regional, county, city, tribal, or
by some combination thereof."


Emergency Responders—The response element of a DRF that deploy to the accident scene after the
First Responders to expand C2 and perform support functions. Emergency Responders include follow-on
elements such as firefighters, law enforcement personnel, security personnel, and emergency medical
technicians, as well as CE Readiness personnel, EOD personnel, physicians, nurses, medical treatment
providers at medical treatment facilities, readiness officers, public health officers, bioenvironmental engi-
neering personnel, and mortuary affairs personnel. Emergency Responders also include specialized teams
such as the RST or SMT. Not all Emergency Responders are First Responders, but all First Responders
are Emergency Responders. Emergency Responders are not assigned to additional duties that will conflict
with their emergency duties. For the purposes of AFIMS, EOD personnel are considered Emergency
Responders but not First Responders.


Emergency Support Function (ESF)—ESFs are groupings of capabilities into an organizational struc-
ture that provides the support, resources, program implementation, and services that are most likely to be
needed during an incident. ESFs also serve as the primary operational-level mechanism that provides sup-
port during an incident.


Evacuation—1. The process of moving any person who is wounded, injured, or ill to and/or between
medical treatment facilities. 2. The clearance of personnel, animals, or materiel from a given locality. 3.
ANDERSENAFBI10-207 21 MARCH 2007                                                                         57


The controlled process of collecting, classifying, and shipping unserviceable or abandoned materiel, US
or foreign, to appropriate reclamation, maintenance, technical intelligence, or disposal facilities. 4. The
ordered or authorized departure of noncombatants from a specific area by Department of State, DOD, or
appropriate military commander. This refers to the movement from one area to another in the same or dif-
ferent countries. The evacuation is caused by unusual or emergency circumstances and applies equally to
command or non-command sponsored family members.


Expeditionary Operation—An expeditionary operation is a military operation conducted by an armed
force to accomplish a specific objective in a foreign country. The missions of military expeditions may
vary widely. Examples of missions of military expeditions include providing humanitarian assistance in
times of disaster or disruption; establishing and keeping peace in a foreign country; protecting US citizens
or commerce abroad; retaliating for an act of aggression by a foreign political group; and destroying an
enemy government by defeating its armed forces in combat.


Expeditionary Units—These designated units are formed to conduct a specific mission of limited dura-
tion in support of a combatant commander requirement. Because a standing wing, group, or squadron
does not normally deploy intact, UTCs from multiple units are deployed to create an expeditionary unit.


Explosive Ordnance—All munitions containing explosives, nuclear fission or fusion materials, and bio-
logical and chemical agents. This includes bombs and warheads; guided and ballistic missiles; artillery,
mortar, rocket, and small arms ammunition; all mines, torpedoes and depth charges; demolition charges;
pyrotechnics; clusters and dispensers; cartridge and propellant actuated devices; electro-explosive
devices; clandestine and IEDs; and all similar or related items or components explosive in nature.


Facility—A real property entity consisting of one or more of the following: a building, a structure, a util-
ity system, pavement, and underlying land.


Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)—The Federal agency tasked to establish Federal
policies for and coordinate civil defense and civil emergency planning, management, mitigation, and
assistance functions of Executive agencies.


First Receivers—Healthcare workers at a medical facility that may receive contaminated victims for
treatment.


First Responders—The DRF elements that deploys immediately to the disaster scene to provide initial
C2, to save lives, and to suppress and control hazards. Firefighters, law enforcement security personnel
and key medical personnel provide the initial, immediate response to a CBRNE incident. All First
Responders are Emergency Responders, but not all Emergency Responders are First Responders. First
Responders are not assigned as augmentees or to additional duties that will conflict with their emergency
duties.

Force Protection (FP)—Actions taken to prevent or mitigate hostile actions against Department of
Defense personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information. These
actions conserve the force’s fighting potential so it can be applied at the decisive time and place and incor-
porate the coordinated and synchronized offensive and defensive measures to enable the effective
employment of the joint force while degrading opportunities for the enemy. Force protection does not
include actions to defeat the enemy or protect against accidents, weather, or disease. Also called FP. (JP
1-02) [An integrated application of offensive and defensive actions that deter, detect, pre-empt, mitigate,
or negate threats against or hazards to Air Force air and space operations and assets, based on an accept-
able level of risk.](Definition in brackets applies only to the Air Force and is offered for clarity.) See also
AFI 10-245.


Functional Area Analysis (FAA)—The FAA identifies the operational tasks, conditions, and standards
needed to achieve military objectives. It uses the national strategies, the Family of Joint Future Concepts,
UCP-assigned missions, CONOPS, joint tasks, the capabilities list (e.g., Universal Joint Task List), the
anticipated range of broad capabilities that an adversary might employ and other sources as input. The
FAA identifies the scenarios against which the capabilities and attributes will be assessed. Scenario
sources include, but are not limited to, the Defense Planning Scenarios (DPS) published by the Office of
the Secretary of Defense (OSD). The FAA produces a prioritized list of capabilities and tasks across all
functional areas necessary to achieve the military objectives. The capabilities and their attributes should
be traceable to the Family of Joint Future Concepts and any other supporting information used to develop
the capabilities. These capabilities form the basis for integrated architectures and will be reviewed in the
follow-on functional needs analysis (FNA).


Functional Needs Analysis (FNA)—The FNA assesses the ability of the current and programmed warf-
ighting systems to deliver the capabilities the FAA identified under the full range of operating conditions
and to the designated measures of effectiveness. Using the capabilities and tasks identified in the FAA as
primary input, the FNA produces a list of capability gaps that require solutions and indicates the time
frame in which those solutions are needed. It may also identify redundancies in capabilities that reflect
inefficiencies. The FNA will also provide the relative priority of the gaps identified. The FNA serves to
further define and refine the integrated architectures. The FNA must assess the entire range of doctrine,
organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities and policy, as an inher-
ent part of defining capability needs.


Gross Decontamination—(Also known as Hasty or Expedient decontamination.) The start of the decon-
tamination process during which the amount of surface contaminants is significantly reduced. Note: This
process typically includes as a minimum completely flushing with water and the removal of most or all of
a person’s clothing while continuing to flush. When warranted, decontamination soap or other products
may be provided. The EPA does not require runoff control when this decontamination process is used to
save lives or reduce injury.
ANDERSENAFBI10-207 21 MARCH 2007                                                                           59


Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT)—Any material that is flammable, corrosive, an oxidizing agent,
explosive, toxic, poisonous, etiological, radioactive, nuclear, unduly magnetic, a chemical agent, biologi-
cal research material, compressed gases, or any other material that, because of its quantity, properties, or
packaging, may endanger life or property.


Hazardous Material Incident—A situation in which a hazardous material is or may be released into the
environment.
High Threat Area (HTA)—See CBRNE High Threat Area.


High-Yield Explosive (HE)—Any conventional weapon or device that is capable of a high order of
destruction or disruption or of being used to kill or injure large numbers of people.


Homeland Defense—The protection of United States sovereignty, territory, domestic population, and
critical infrastructure against external threats and aggression or other threats as directed by the President.
The Department of Defense is responsible for homeland defense. Homeland defense includes missions
such as domestic air defense. The Department recognizes that threats planned or inspired by “external”
actors may materialize internally. The reference to “external threats” does not limit where or how attacks
could be planned and executed. The Department is prepared to conduct homeland defense missions when-
ever the President, exercising his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief, authorizes military
actions.


Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 (HSPD-5)—A Presidential directive issued on February
28, 2003 and intended to enhance the ability of the United States to manage domestic incidents by estab-
lishing a single, comprehensive National Incident Management System (NIMS).


Homeland Security—Homeland security, as defined in the National Strategy for Homeland Security, is a
concerted national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce America’s vulnera-
bility to terrorism, and minimize the damage and recover from attacks that do occur. The Department of
Defense contributes to homeland security through its military missions overseas, homeland defense, and
support to civil authorities.


Host Nation (HN)—A nation that receives the forces or supplies of allied nations, coalition partners, or
NATO organizations to be located on, to operate in, or to transit through its territory.


Hot Zone—The area immediately surrounding a HAZMAT incident, extending far enough to prevent
adverse effects from HAZMAT releases to personnel outside the zone.


Identification—In CBRNE operations, the determination of which CBRNE material or pathogen is
present.

Incident Commander (IC)—The command function is directed by the IC, who is the person in charge at
the incident and who must be fully qualified to manage the response. Major responsibilities for the IC
include: performing command activities, such as establishing command; protecting life and property; con-
trolling personnel and equipment resources; maintaining accountability for responder and public safety, as
well as for task accomplishment; and establishing and maintaining an effective liaison with outside agen-
cies and organizations, including the EOC when it is activated.


Incident Command System—(ICS)—ICS is the model tool for command, control, and coordination of
a response and provides a means to coordinate the efforts of individual agencies as they work toward the
common goal of stabilizing the incident and protecting life, property, and the environment. ICS uses prin-
ciples that have been proven to improve efficiency and effectiveness in a business setting and applies the
principles to emergency response.


Incident—An occurrence or event, natural or human caused, that requires an emergency response to pro-
tect life or property. Incidents can, for example, include major disasters, emergencies, terrorist attacks,
terrorist threats, wildland and urban fires, floods, HAZMAT spills, nuclear accidents, aircraft accidents,
earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms, war-related disasters, public health and medical emer-
gencies, and other occurrences requiring an emergency response.


Incidents of National Significance—An actual or potential high-impact event that requires a coordinated
and effective response by an appropriate combination of Federal, State, local, tribal, nongovernmental, or
private-sector entities to save lives and minimize damage and provide the basis for long-term community
recovery and mitigation activities.


Individual Protection—Actions taken by individuals to survive and continue the mission under nuclear,
biological, and chemical conditions.


Individual Protective Equipment (IPE)—In nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare, the personal
clothing and equipment required to protect an individual from biological and chemical hazards and some
nuclear effects.


Initial Actions—The actions taken by those responders who are first to arrive at an incident site.


Initial Detection—Procedures performed by emergency responders to determine the presence of
HAZMAT. Initial detection is a field test using detection equipment to provide a reasonable basis for
acceptance of the presence of hazards.
ANDERSENAFBI10-207 21 MARCH 2007                                                                           61

Joint Force—A general term applied to a force composed of significant elements, assigned or attached,
of two or more military departments, operating under a single joint force commander.


Law Enforcement Agency—Any of a number of agencies (outside the DOD) chartered and empowered
to enforce US laws in the following jurisdictions: the United States, a State or political subdivision of the
United States, a territory or possession of the United States, or within the borders of a host nation.

mudslide, snowstorm, or drought) or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood or explosion, in any part of the
United States, which in the determination of the President causes damage of sufficient severity and mag-
nitude to warrant major disaster assistance under this act to supplement the efforts and available resources
of States, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or
suffering caused thereby.


Mass Decontamination—(or, Mass Casualty Decontamination) The physical process of rapidly reducing

logical, and chemical contamination. This posture requires personnel to wear only that protective clothing
and MOPP equipment appropriate to the threat level, work rate imposed by the mission, temperature, and
humidity.


Mitigation—Activities designed to reduce or eliminate risks to persons or property or to lessen the actual
or potential effects or consequences of an incident. Mitigation measures may be implemented prior to,
during, or after an incident. Mitigation measures are often developed IAW lessons learned from prior inci-
dents. Mitigation involves ongoing actions to reduce exposure to, probability of, or potential loss from
hazards. Measures may include zoning and building codes, flood plain buyouts, and analysis of haz-
ard-related data to determine where it is safe to build or locate temporary facilities. Mitigation can include
efforts to educate governments, businesses, and the public on measures they can take to reduce loss and
injury.


Monitoring—The process of sampling over time to identify changes in conditions.


Mutual Aid Agreement (MAA)—Written agreement between agencies, organizations, or jurisdictions
that they will assist one another on request by furnishing personnel, equipment, or expertise in a specified
manner. Reciprocal assistance by local government and an installation for emergency services under a
prearranged plan. Mutual aid is synonymous with "mutual assistance," "outside aid," "memorandums of
understanding," "memorandums of agreement," "letters of agreement," "cooperative assistant agree-
ment," "intergovernmental compacts," or other similar agreements, written or verbal, that constitute an
agreed reciprocal assistance plan for sharing emergency services. MAAs between entities are an effective
means to obtain resources and should be developed whenever possible. MAAs should be in writing, be
reviewed by legal counsel, and be signed by a responsible official.

National Defense Area (NDA)—An area established on non-Federal lands located within the United
States, its possessions, or territories for the purpose of safeguarding classified defense information or pro-
tecting DOD equipment or material. Establishment of an NDA temporarily places such non-Federal lands
under the effective control of the DOD and results only from an emergency event. The senior DOD repre-
sentative at the scene will define the boundary, mark it with a physical barrier, and post warning signs.
The landowner’s consent and cooperation will be obtained whenever possible; however, military neces-
sity will dictate the final decision regarding location, shape, and size of the NDA.


National Disaster Medical System (NDMS)—The NDMS is an integrated Federal, State, local, and pri-
vate sector medical response system for medical support during wartime or major United States domestic
disasters. NDMS provides DOD with medical care resources from the civilian sector to back up the Vet-
erans Administration and DOD medical contingency arrangement.

sistent, nationwide approach for Federal, State, local, and tribal governments; the private sector; and non-
governmental organizations to work effectively and efficiently together to prepare for, respond to, and
recover from domestic incidents, regardless of cause, size, or complexity. To provide for interoperability
and compatibility among Federal, State, local, and tribal capabilities, the NIMS includes a core set of con-
cepts, principles, and terminology. HSPD-5 identifies these as the ICS; multi-agency coordination sys-
tems; training; identification, and management of resources (including systems for classifying types of
resources); qualification and certification; and the collection, tracking, and reporting of incident informa-
tion and incident resources.


National Response System (NRS)—Pursuant to the National Contingency Plan, the mechanism for

bilities, and identify required resources.


Presumptive Identification—The tentative determination of a CBRNE material or pathogen’s identity
with sufficient specificity and confidence to make expedient, risk-based control decisions until confirma-
tory identification can be completed.


Prevention—Actions to avoid an incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring. Prevention
involves actions to protect lives and property. It involves applying intelligence and other information to a
range of activities that may include such countermeasures as deterrence operations; heightened inspec-

Regional Response Teams (RRT)—Regional counterparts to the National Response Team, the RRTs
comprise regional representatives of the Federal agencies on the NRT and representatives of each State
within the region. The RRTs serve as planning and preparedness bodies before a response and provide
coordination and advice to the Federal IC during response actions.


Response—Activities that address the short-term, direct effects of an incident. Response includes imme-
diate actions to save lives, protect property, and meet basic human needs. Response also includes the exe-
cution of emergency operations plans and of incident mitigation activities designed to limit the loss of life,
personal injury, property damage, and other unfavorable outcomes. As indicated by the situation,
response activities include: applying intelligence and other information to lessen the effects or conse-
quences of an incident; increased security operations; continuing investigations into the nature and source
of the threat; ongoing public health and agricultural surveillance and testing processes; immunizations,
isolation or quarantine; and specific law enforcement operations aimed at preempting, interdicting or dis-
rupting illegal activity and apprehending actual perpetrators and bringing them to justice.


Response Task Force (RTF)—A DOD response force appropriately staffed, trained, and equipped to
coordinate actions necessary to control and recover from a radiological accident. The specific purpose of
the RTF is to recover weapons and provide radiological accident assistance. RTFs are organized and
maintained by those Combatant Commanders whose Component Commands have custody of nuclear
weapons or radioactive nuclear weapon components. RTFs are not structured to respond to terrorist use of
CBRNE or radiological dirty bombs. HQ ACC and HQ PACAF maintain MAJCOM RTFs for specific
roles and responsibilities. See paragraphs 3.7.1. and 3.7.7.

DRF. Examples of such teams are Search and Recovery or Crash Recovery.


Standardization Agreement (STANAG)—The record of an agreement among several or all of the mem-
ber nations to adopt like or similar military equipment, ammunition, supplies and stores, and operational,
logistic and administrative procedures. National acceptance of a NATO allied publication issued by the
Military Agency for Standardization may be recorded as a STANAG.


Status-of-Forces Agreement (SOFA)—An agreement which defines the legal position of a visiting mil-
itary force deployed in the territory of a friendly state. Agreements delineating the status of visiting mili-
tary forces may be bilateral or multilateral. Provisions pertaining to the status of visiting forces may be set
forth in a separate agreement or they may form a part of a more comprehensive agreement. These provi-
sions describe how the authorities of a visiting force may control members of that force and the amenabil-
ity of the force or its members to the local law or to the authority of local officials. To the extent that
agreements delineate matters affecting the relations between a military force and civilian authorities and
population, they may be considered as civil affairs agreements.

        mentation, or internal controls that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to information
        systems.


Warm Zone—The area where personnel and equipment decontamination and hot zone support take
place. It includes control points for the access corridor and thus assists in reducing the spread of contami-
nation.


Water Vulnerability Assessment (WVA)—A method that provides a tool to understand the risk of oper-
ations and pinpoint areas where security improvements might reduce risk. The assessments focus on the
effectiveness of existing countermeasures, mitigation, and recovery capabilities.


Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD)—Weapons that are capable of a high order of destruction or of
being used in such a manner as to destroy large numbers of people. WMD can be high explosives or
nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological weapons, but exclude the means of transporting or propel-
ling the weapon where such means is a separable and divisible part of the weapon.

land security missions. These teams are comprised of 22 full-time personnel and are maintained at the
highest readiness levels and can respond rapidly to support civil authorities in an event involving a
weapon of mass destruction. Their role is to assist local officials in determining the nature of the attack,
provide medical and technical advice and help to identify follow-on Federal and State assets that might be
needed. Congress has authorized at least one team for each State and territory. These teams are Federally
funded and trained but perform their mission under the command and control of the State governor.
