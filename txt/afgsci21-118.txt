                                  GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
1.1. Introduction. This instruction defines logistics performance terms and has reporting and
review procedures to enable AFGSC to manage by fact. The focus is measurement of the many
logistics processes that provide combat capability to the unit. The result of compliance with this
instruction should be the quick and accurate identification of areas for improvement, as well as
identification of support problems beyond the scope of the unit. The unit's role emphasizes in-
depth analysis of work processes, integrity in measurement methods, timeliness in reporting, and
comprehensive remarks describing particular unit support issues requiring further analysis and
action. The headquarters' role is to assist AFGSC units in process analysis, identification of
opportunities for process improvement, identification of process standards and benchmarks, and
maintenance of guidelines for consistent unit performance measurement and reporting. This
program is called Logistics and Maintenance Performance Indicators (L-MPI). By no means
should units limit their performance reviews to only the items reported to the headquarters. There
are many other metrics available to unit managers that are helpful in determining unit health such
as repeat/recur rates, Cannot Duplicate rates, deferred discrepancy rates, maintenance scheduling
effectiveness, system reliability/capability, attrition, etc.
1.2. Applicability. This instruction applies to all AFGSC units possessing or supporting aircraft
(to include helicopters). All units will adhere to this instruction to the greatest extent possible
within the current contract requirements. CLS limitations will be identified and waivers to the
applicable portions of AFGSCI 21-118 will be requested from HQ AFGSC/A4M. AFGSC policy
is to reduce these waivers, where possible, when CLS contracts are reviewed / renegotiated.
1.3. Responsibility. Wing, Unit, and Maintenance Group and Operations Group commanders are
responsible for compliance. Commanders or their designated representative will ensure all
reports cited in this instruction are prepared and transmitted as prescribed. The preparing agency
and office of primary responsibility (OPR) is the Maintenance Data Systems Analysis (MDSA)
section (or designated contractor where required) regardless of organizational structure.
Commanders will review the accuracy of data required by this instruction and take action to
improve deficiencies. Commanders have overall responsibility for ensuring quality, in-depth
analysis of L-MPI drivers as prescribed in paragraph 3.2. References within the document to
"you" or "your" apply to the preparing agency unless otherwise noted.
1.4. Request for Waivers or Changes to Instruction. Submit recommended changes and / or
waivers to this instruction via regular mail to HQ AFGSC/A4M, 41 Orville Wright Avenue,
Suite 5341, Barksdale AFB LA 71110, or e-mail to AFGSCA4M@barksdale.af.mil.
1.5. Reporting During Minimize Conditions. Minimize conditions are controlled by a
designated communication agency. A minimize condition occurs to limit message traffic during
contingencies as needed. All reporting will continue during minimize conditions with "Minimize
Considered" entered at the bottom of each page of the report. Reports cited under this instruction
are essential and require expeditious preparation and transmission during emergency conditions.
1.6. Algorithms. Formulas used in computing rates and performance indicators are listed in
attachment 2.

                        REPORT TRANSMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
2.1. Report Transmission Methods. The Monthly Logistics Indicators Report, RCS: AFGSC-
A4M 9302 must be transmitted via the EKM System using the MPI Enterprise Portal. The EKM
is located at https://www.aekm.wpafb.af.mil. A username and password is required to access the
site. Contact your local EKM administrator for assistance or call AFGSC/A4M, DSN 781-0253.
All other reports specified in this instruction will be transmitted via electronic mail (e-mail) to:
AFGSCA4M@barksdale.af.mil. Where e-mail capability is not available, send required reports
via fax to DSN 781-9899.
2.2. Report Templates. Each wing/unit has a 9302 report template specifically designed for its
MDS(s) and reporting requirements. Use of the templates is mandatory. The templates must not
be modified in any manner. This includes adding external data links. External data links are
expressly forbidden, because they adversely affect data upload on the EKM servers. Templates
can be obtained from the EKM/MPI web site. Templates change based on HQ AFGSC reporting
requirements, so wings/units should check this web site frequently.
2.3. Enterprise Knowledge Management (EKM) System Training. EKM/MPI training is
available via the EKM website using the MPI customer support portlet. If additional training is
needed, contact AFGSC/A4M.
2.4. Restriction on Types of Information. Only UNCLASSIFIED information is acceptable.
Do not include CLASSIFIED information in the report. If we require classified information on
any report, we will specify the appropriate transmission method (usually SIPRNET e-mail).
2.4.1. Logistics Data Classification. Aircraft inventory, status, and utilization data reported
under this instruction are unclassified. AFSSI, volume 1, table 3.2, states: “Logistics information,
data concerning status and allocation of personnel and material to/from various locations (such
as unit readiness and weapon status), is considered sensitive information. “There is no distinction
between normal operations or real world operations and the classification of data does not
change.” Units are required to submit complete, timely 9302 reports during contingencies.

                        AIRCRAFT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
3.1. Types of Reports. This chapter describes the overall report concept. It provides formats for
each type of report, i.e., Monthly Logistics Indicators Report, RCS: AFGSC-A4M 9302; and
Special Requests for Logistics Data, RCS: AFGSC-A4M 9303.
3.2. Explanatory Remarks. Each report provides space for explanatory remarks. Use the space
to explain findings from staff research (analysis) into unit processes. Your unit's comments
provide background information for the L-MPI briefing to AFGSC/CC. Therefore, quality, in-
depth remarks are required. Provide explanations for your cumulative unit data. Combine all the
comments into one narrative for a given rate. For example, do not provide a separate Not
Mission Capable Maintenance (NMCM) narrative for a particular squadron and for the unit
overall. If there are key issues for a squadron, make sure those are put in with the overall unit
comments. Deployed comments must be rolled up into the overall unit comments. Comments
must be entered in the appropriate block (SEC2 NARRATIVE) of the report template.
3.2.1. Provide explanations for all indicators each month, even when key indicators meet
standards and goals. The narrative is not complete unless it covers the Who, What, When,
Where, Why, and How of the indicator. Do not simply regurgitate numbers for the narrative
explanations. Narratives must provide important details explaining why an item drove unit
performance. List the top five subsystem drivers and top three component (5-digit) drivers for
each subsystem. When addressing aircraft status, list NMCM, Not Mission Capable Supply
(NMCS), and Not Mission Capable Both (NMCB) drivers. If various inspections drove Not
Mission Capable (NMC) time, list the pacing Mission Impaired Capability Awaiting Parts
(MICAPs). Analyze the data. Long-term and short-term trends are important. Do not just focus
on the current month's data to determine if a trend exists. Look at the entire picture to make those
determinations. The direction from AFGSC leaders is to provide “predictive analysis,” which
means determining where indicators are headed over next several months. Predictive analysis
includes, among other things, identifying anticipated changes in aircraft availability, i.e.,
expected depot inductions, depot field teams, extended scheduled maintenance, or any other
issues that may impact the unit’s ability to meet mission requirements. When possible, quantify
an issue or event’s impact on mission capability, i.e., one-time inspection reduced aircraft
availability by 10%. Although the statement "No Trends Noted" is completely valid, do not use it
lightly. Your unit's report must include comments from maintenance management/sortie
production personnel (i.e., Maintenance Group/Deputy Group Commander, Maintenance
Operations, Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) OICs, Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS)
Commanders, and Maintenance Operations Officers). List pacing aircraft and unit events such as
training, exercises, stand-downs, or deployments that may have affected unit performance.
Provide projected unit plans to fix pacing items. Submit thorough comments so we can
incorporate them directly into our L-MPIs with minimal editing. For all explanations, use the full
five-digit work unit code (WUC).
3.2.2. For NMCS drivers and high cannibalization items, provide the full National Stock Number
(NSN), part number (if obtained through CLS contractor), full five-digit WUC, noun, and
explanation. This enables A4M analysts and Air Force Global Logistics Support Center
(AFGLSC) personnel to address the correct parts problems. The comment "NSN not available" is
not acceptable. Be sure components are listed under the correct subsystem/WUC. For manning
and training issues, we require the complete AFSC as well as an explanation of the problem. For
AFGSCI21-118 1 DECEMBER 2009                                                                  5

inspections and Time Change Technical Orders (TCTO), the type of inspection and TCTO
number are required.
3.3. Coordination and Correction Procedures. Unit commanders will establish coordination
procedures to ensure the on-time release of accurate data to HQ AFGSC/A4M. Route the report
through all appropriate maintenance management/sortie production personnel for their review
and comments prior to transmission to HQ AFGSC/A4M. The MPI Enterprise Portal has an
automated routing tool. It should be used to the greatest extent possible. To ensure valid MICAP
drivers are submitted, the Maintenance Supply Liaison (MSL)/Logistics Readiness Squadron
(LRS) must review and validate the top Total Not Mission Capable Supply (TNMCS) items and
ensure each one has a valid NSN as well as a complete part description. For example, instead of
saying PDU Flap/Slat, say Power Drive Unit. Instead of Cyl, Servo Hyd, Horiz Stab Lower
L&R, use Stab Actuator. To facilitate this review, the MSL/LRS should maintain close contact
with the AFGLSC weapon system manager who supports their unit's weapon system(s). The
local Logistics Readiness Squadron commander should review the report also. Tenant unit
coordination must include base supply/Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply
(COMBS) representatives responsible for MICAP support. The automated EKM/MPI process is
designed to allow only one “successful” 9302 submission per month. After a “successful” 9302
submission via the EKM/MPI process, any corrections to reports must be submitted by separate
e-mail or fax with reference to the first data as well as the corrected data. To prevent briefing
erroneous data to HQ AFGSC/A4/7 or HQ AFGSC/DS, we require a telephone "heads-up" of the
data change. The unit OPR will maintain a master file of monthly reports for the current and
previous fiscal year. If there are any reporting errors identified after the reports arrive at HQ
AFGSC/A4M, we will contact the unit OPR. The OPR, in turn, will notify the appropriate base
agency to correct erroneous data. Wing Analysis sections will ensure the timely submission of
corrected reports.
3.4. Monthly Aircraft Logistics Indicators Report, RCS: AFGSC-A4M 9302
3.4.1. Report Use. Intermediate command and MAJCOM managers use this report. It is the
official source document for MPI briefings to the HQ AFGSC/DS and the AFGSC/A4/7. It
consists of three primary sections: Section I (wing overall), Deployed (wing deployment),
Section II (drivers and narrative explanations). The comments should be specific and address
reasons why the unit did not meet standards.
3.4.2. Report Auto-Population and Manual Entries. The majority of the 9302 report data is auto-
populated via the EKM/MPI process. The report is prefilled with all required data items, except
Sorties Programmed, Hours Programmed, Total Utilization Rate (UTE) Deviations for FSE (all
categories), Average Hangar Queens and Hangar Queen Categories, Total Dedicated Crew
Chiefs (DCCs) Job Data Documentation (JDD) Error Rate, Total Maintenance Man-hours per
Flying Hour, Repeats - Recurs, Pilot Reported Discrepancy (PRDs), Total Possessed Hours, and
Deployed data. These items must be updated manually. The 9302 must be submitted via
EKM/MPI Portal. To facilitate monthly report preparation, prefilled weekly reports can be
downloaded to allow units to begin early analyses of specific drivers.
3.4.3. Home base units will report deployed aircraft information under a separate column in the
deployed section (tab) of the standard template. The EKM/MPI process does not auto-populate
the 9302 deployed data tab. It is a "stand-alone" worksheet that must be updated manually. The
deployment column will be labeled with the deployment name and MDS. When a unit is
supporting more than one major deployment, each deployment will be reported under a separate
6                                                        AFGSCI21-118 1 DECEMBER 2009

column. Deployed drivers and their impact on overall wing performance must be highlighted,
i.e., specifically referred to, and clearly identified in wing comments. For deployments, unless
otherwise stated, the programmed hours/sorties flown are equal to the actual hours/sorties flown.
Add these programmed hours/sorties in to the overall Wing total programmed hours/sorties. Do
not report zero for programmed hours/sorties if your unit had actual hours/sorties flown at a
deployed location. Do not report data for exercises, i.e., Red Flag, Air Warrior, etc., in the
deployed section of the AFGSC-A4M 9302. This section is used for wartime operations,
contingencies, and real-world crises. When exercise data is required, units will be given specific
guidance on reporting requirements.
3.4.4. Frequency of Reporting: The AFGSC-A4M 9302 report is transmitted to HQ AFGSC
monthly. Transmit the data elements (rates/raw data in template Section 1 and the Deployed tab)
via EKM/MPI NLT 1200L on the fifth duty day following the month being reported. Top drivers
and comments must be transmitted NLT the eighth duty day following the month being reported.
Please inform AFGSC/A4M as soon as you are aware of any situation that may cause a late
transmission.
3.4.5. Report Preparation. The 9302 report is auto-populated as outlined in the standard report
template specifically designed for each wing. Use of the standard report template is mandatory.
Do not deviate from the numbering system outlined in this instruction or in the template. The
standard templates for each wing are available on the EKM website at
https://www.aekm.wpafb.af.mil.
3.4.5.1. Section I. Section one contains the overall wing/MDS/Block data totals.

3.4.5.2. AMU MPI Data (Old Section II). The requirement to report aircraft maintenance
indicators by AMU is rescinded. Although units are no longer required to provide HQ AFGSC
with Section II data, Weapon System Teams (WSTs) and other staff agencies may request this
information to answer questions from senior leadership. When tasked, provide the requesting
agency with the appropriate AMU data.
3.4.6. Total Aircraft Inventory (TAI). See paragraph A2.19.
3.4.7. Automated MPI and Continuous Comments. The automated MPI tool has a Continuous
Comments feature that allows units to record the details surrounding logistics drivers throughout
the month. This feature is a key component of the EKM/MPI process. It facilitates analyses of
drivers by providing a means to record the root causes, on-line, while the details are still fresh in
the minds of those persons involved. It allows for a continuous flow of information from across
the Maintenance Group and a collection point for explanatory remarks. Then, the explanatory
remarks are integrated into the Section II Narratives portion of the 9302. The result is more
accurate, thorough analyses of drivers and timely completion of the 9302 report. Use of the
Continuous Comments feature is mandatory. All users should make inputs to the wing’s
Continuous Comments.
SECTION II - COMMENTS. Provide explanations for all indicators each month, even if key
wing/unit indicators meet HQ AFGSC standards, goals, or MDS averages. List the top five
subsystem drivers and top three 5-digit WUC drivers for each subsystem when addressing MC,
NMCM, NMCS, and NMCB. List the top five system drivers and top three 5-digit WUC drivers
for abort, break, fix, FSE, cannibalizations, and repeat-recurs. See Attachment 3. Refer to
paragraphs 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 for more information concerning narrative requirements.

AFGSCI21-118 1 DECEMBER 2009                                                                   9


                                           Chapter 4
                              DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
4.1. Applicability. This chapter outlines guidance for units with a deployment commitment for
contingencies, exercises, crises, or wartime operations. Paragraph 4.5 provides a sample report
format to collect data at deployed locations. Units may use any format they choose for local
reporting as long as it satisfies RCS: AFGSC-A4M 9302 requirements. We do not require a
weekly deployment report. However, when contingencies arise, we may re-instate the AFGSC-
A4M 9303 report to request such data. See Chapter 5.
4.2. Reporting Requirements. Units are required to report on deployed aircraft (including those
gained from other units) in accordance with Operational Plans (OPlans) under which they are
tasked for support. They must comply with guidelines on reporting established by the MAJCOM
and Joint Task Force they are tasked to support. During deployments, the unit's primary
reporting role will be to the deployed headquarters with informational copies to their home base
and supporting MAJCOM When Maintenance Data Systems Analysts are not deployed,
deployed commanders will designate an individual or activity to perform L-MPI reporting
requirements.
4.2.1. Deployed reporting to HQ AFGSC will only be required for wartime operations,
contingencies, major deployments, and real-world crises, not deployments to Red Flag,
Gunsmoke, or participation in Air Warrior, etc.
4.2.2. Personnel at homestation will report deployed aircraft information under a separate
column in the deployed tab of the RCS: AFGSC-A4M 9302, Monthly Aircraft Logistics
Indicators Report template. The EKM/MPI process does not autopopulate the 9302 deployed
data tab. It is a "stand-alone" worksheet that must be updated manually. Explanations must be
provided for deployed units even if key indicators meet AFGSC standards, goals, or averages.
The explanations must be included in the overall wing comments.
4.3. Development of Analysis Deployment Package. Each unit's MDSA section should develop
a deployment package. The package should identify equipment and supplies required for each
type of deployment commitment, i.e., bare-base operation, limited communications, or full-
blown operation. Things to consider when developing this package are the equipment needed to
operate the Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) i.e., personal computers, printers,
modems, cables, and quantity required. MDSA should also identify required software, i.e.,
InfoConnect, word-processing, spreadsheet, database, etc. How many days or months of office
supplies are required? Also needed are lists of points of contact at base level, MAJCOM,
deployed Headquarters and units, and manuals on operating the IMDS. Units should also have
written manual backup procedures for IMDS documentation. Gather all applicable instructions
and manuals the deployed analyst may need. In addition, wing or command level analysts at
deployed locations are encouraged to contact their replacement(s) at the earliest possible time to
inform them of any training or job knowledge requirements needed to perform the assigned
duties at the deployed location(s).
4.4 IMDS for Mobility (G081) Training. Maintenance Analysis responsibilities at some
deployed locations may require the use of G081. If training is needed, analysts can access the
G081 Analysis Training program via the 367th Training Support Squadron’s Interactive Course
Management System (ICMS). The 367th Training Support Squadron is located at Hill AFB. The
World Wide Web address is https://367catalog.hill.af.mil/catalog/index.aspx. The G081 Analysis
Training program will familiarize the student with G081 GUI screens, specifically the program

used to produce batch reports. Personnel must download and install the ICMS software to use the
on-line course material. The Interactive Multimedia Flight POC can be reached at DSN 586-
4014 or 777-0160, or email at 367trss.tsidp@hill.af.mil. Units can also contact AFGSC/A4M
Analysis Team, DSN 781-0253, for assistance.
4.5. Sample Deployed Operation Weekly Report. A sample report is provided below to ensure
that during deployments, a minimum set of data elements are captured for briefings to senior
leaders and analyses of problem areas. This is a sample report only. Your deployed unit’s
specific report format will depend on your deployed commander's requirements.

       SPECIAL REQUEST FOR LOGISTICS DATA, RCS: AFGSC-A4M(AR)9303
5.1. Applicability. Periodic requirements exist for recurring short-term reports to collect data in
support of special studies and analyses. We use the RCS: AFGSC-A4M 9303 report to task units
for these special requests. Units will not be tasked without prior approval of HQ AFGSC/A4M.
All units assigned to AFGSC are subject to this tasking. Reports are not required unless
specifically tasked by HQ AFGSC/A4M.
5.2. Tasking Instructions. HQ AFGSC/A4M provides instructions in the tasking notification.
Instructions will specify report format, content, procedures for data collection, and frequency of
report as well as a report termination date.
5.3. Method and Frequency of Reports. Send all RCS: AFGSC-A4M 9303 reports via e-mail
to HQ AFGSC/A4M. When e-mail is not available, fax reports to all addressees listed in the
tasking message. Applicable intermediate headquarters should receive information copies of all
reports.
                                          Chapter 6
                            STANDARDS REVIEW PROCESS
6.1. Applicability. The purpose of the Standards Review Process is to develop standards for the
Air Force, Combat Air Forces (CAF) and for Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC)
aircraft. CAF members are Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), Air Combat Command
(ACC), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Air National Guard
(ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). The collective goal is to have standards that
Air Force personnel will be motivated to obtain and exceed based on operational and resource
requirements. Standards are used to keep leadership advised of overall force readiness, to
identify and isolate breakdowns in required outside resources, and to identify units that need
further examination.
6.2. Air Force Maintenance Standards. Standards for MC, Total Not Mission Capable
Maintenance (TNMCM), and Total Not Mission Capable Supply (TNMCS) are requirements-
based and computed at Air Force level. AF standards are used to measure unit and fleet health.
Until FY04, the MC, TNMCM and TNMCS rate standards were based primarily on unit
capabilities, taking into consideration weapon system technical and support limitations. Now, the
Air Force MC Rate standard is based primarily on fleet flying hour program and training
12                                                           AFGSCI21-118 1 DECEMBER 2009

requirements. The TNMCS rate standard is based upon the aircraft availability targets and
funding streams. The TNMCM rate standard is based on known scheduled maintenance
requirements and a study of unscheduled maintenance rates over the past three years, with
adjustments based on projected NMCB rates, potential maintenance issues such as programmed
time compliance technical orders, etc. The AF maintenance standards development process
begins when MAJCOMs are tasked to provide specific information on aircraft operated in the
command. This data includes, but is not limited to; primary aircraft authorized (PAA), utilization
rates, attrition, turn patterns, fly days, spares, and scheduled maintenance factors. Subsequently,
AFGSC/A4M sends requests to all AFGSC wings to obtain their input. Wings are also highly
encouraged to provide any additional information, positive or negative, that may impact
operational requirements. Impacts should be quantified when possible. Wing input is
consolidated, reviewed and validated by weapon system teams, and finally approved for
submission to AF/A4L. AFGSC/A4M works closely with AF/A4L throughout the standards
development process. Air Force Reserve (AFRES) and Air National Guard (ANG) standards are
developed independently per AF/A4L direction.
6.3. AFGSC Standards, Goals, and MDS Averages. Standards are developed for all AFGSC
owned aircraft for the following indicators: 8 Hour Fix Rate, 12 Hour Fix Rate, Total Abort
Rate, Flying Scheduling Effectiveness Rate, Maintenance/Operations Deviation Rate,
Cannibalization Rate, and Repeat - Recur rate. AFGSC measures the Break Rate using MDS
averages. NOTE: 12 Hour Fix Rate only applies to B-2, B-52.
6.4. AFGSC Standards Review and Development Process. The review and development
process takes place annually, or as needed. These reviews usually occur during July or August.
Each review involves these basic steps:
6.4.1. The units are contacted for their inputs as needed.
6.4.2. MAJCOM analysts prepare historical data for use in the review.
6.4.3. The standards review and development process begins. MAJCOM analysts and weapon
system teams (from maintenance and supply) perform the review. Information reviewed
includes, but is not limited to, unit inputs, historical data, and expected changes in support and
the operational environment. Historical data includes current indicator average, unit and fleet
trends, frequency units meet current standard, variance, and standard deviation.
6.4.4. After MAJCOM analysts and weapon system teams develop the “preliminary” AFGSC
standards, they are forwarded to AFGSC/A4 for approval. Standards are published prior to the
beginning of each fiscal year.
6.4.5. Interim standards are established when there is an insufficient amount of historical data.
This usually occurs with new weapon systems, units still in buildup or draw down, or when there
is a significant change in mission or support.

Terms and Definitions

Aircraft Availability—Percentage of a fleet not in a Depot possessed status or NMC status (that
are unit possessed).
Air Abort—An airborne aircraft that cannot complete its primary or alternate mission.
Air Abort Rate—The number of air aborts per sorties flown. The rate only includes air aborts
caused by Maintenance or Operations.
Attrition (Aircraft)—Aircraft required to replace primary aircraft inventory losses. Do not
confuse this term with computing attrition rates (e.g., Weather) for developing the flying
schedule.
Average Hangar Queens—An average computed by dividing the total Hangar Queen days
accrued in the reporting period by the inclusive number of days in the reporting period, e.g., 20
Hangar Queen days divided by 30 days in reporting period equals 0.67 average Hangar Queens.
Hangar Queens are broken into three categories: Category I (31-59 days), Category II (60-89
days), and Category III (day 90 and above).
Awaiting Maintenance (AWM) Rate—The total deferred discrepancies for maintenance,
divided by possessed aircraft. See definition of deferred discrepancies.
Awaiting Parts (AWP) Rate—The total deferred discrepancies requiring parts and have a valid
supply requisition number, divided by possessed aircraft. See definition of deferred
discrepancies.
Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI)—Aircraft above the primary mission inventory to permit
scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, modifications, inspections, and repair without
reduction of aircraft available for operational missions.
Break Rate—This is the percentage of aircraft that land with an overall aircraft landing status of
Code-3 or 4. The term Break will refer to the sortie rather than the individual pilot reported
discrepancies.
Cannibalization Rate—The average number of cannibalization actions per 100 sorties. A
cannibalization action is the removal of a serviceable part from an aircraft or engine to replace an
unserviceable part on another aircraft or engine. Cannibalization actions also include the removal
of a serviceable part to fill Readiness Spares Packages (RSP). This rate includes all aircraft-to-
aircraft or RSP and engine-to-aircraft or RSP cannibalization actions. Per T.O. 00-20-2,
16                                                       AFGSCI21-118 1 DECEMBER 2009

paragraph 5.2.4, cannibalization actions from depot aircraft are valid and must be counted in the
cannibalization rate.
Chargeable Aircraft (CHRG)—The number of aircraft against which units should build their
flying programs and against which the UTE will be measured. Chargeable aircraft will normally
equal PAA, but in cases where the number of possessed aircraft is forecast to be significantly
different than PAA, HQ AFGSC/A3 and A4/7 will assign a chargeable aircraft number.
Contractor Logistics Support (CLS)—Non-government managed logistics processes such as
supply and/or maintenance performed by civilian contractors.
Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS)—Non-government managed
supply operation/warehouse supported by civilian contractors.
CY/FY Cumulative (CUM)—The calendar (Jan - Dec) or fiscal year (Oct - Sep) cumulative
performance of an indicator.
Deferred Discrepancy—Malfunctions or discrepancies not creating a NMC or PMC condition
for the aircraft and are not corrected "on the spot" are considered deferred discrepancies.
Deviation—Departure from the printed weekly flying schedule.
Fix Rate—The percentage of aircraft sorties landing with CAP Code-3 or 4 pilot reported
discrepancies (PRDs) in which all of the CAP Code-3 or 4 PRDs are fixed in a certain amount of
time (clock hours). Problems found by maintenance after the aircraft lands (ground found) are
not considered in the fix time. The fix time stops when all CAP Code-3 or 4 PRDs are fixed even
if the aircraft remains NMC. This includes breaks and fixes that occur at any location (off-
Station, etc.).
12-Hour Fix Rate—The cumulative percentage of aircraft breaks fixed within 12 hours. The
break is considered fixed when all CAP Code-3 or 4 PRDs are corrected. This interval is used for
aircraft other than fighters, but includes the T-38.
Flying Scheduling Effectiveness (FSE) Rate—The FSE rate is the percentage of sorties flown
as scheduled. This rate determines how efficiently the planned / printed flying schedule was
executed. It also indicates unit turmoil caused by flying schedule deviations.
Functional Check Flight (FCF)—The flight of an aircraft, in accordance with the applicable
dash -6 manual, to verify the airworthy condition of the aircraft.
Ground Abort—Event after crew show time that prevents a "crew ready" aircraft from
becoming airborne. Ground aborts are categorized as maintenance (GAA, GAB, GAC),
operations, HHQ, weather, sympathy, other, etc. The difference between a ground abort and a
cancellation is after crew show it is a ground abort, before crew show it is a cancel. A ground
abort by itself is not a deviation, but can cause a deviation such as lost sortie or late take-off.
Ground Abort Rate—The number of ground aborts per sortie attempts. This rate includes only
ground aborts caused by Maintenance, Operations, and Supply.
Hangar Queen—An aircraft that has not flown for more than 30 consecutive days. See the
definition for Average Hangar Queens.
Hourly UTE Rate—This is the average hours flown per authorized/chargeable aircraft/systems
per month.
Issue Effectiveness Rate—The percentage of parts requirements immediately satisfied by
Supply, used to measure how well customers are supported. It is used as a macro index for
effectiveness from all supply sources.
JDD Error Rate—The percentage of records found in error in the IMDS JDD subsystem during
the Data Integrity Team (DIT) review. For JDD error rate computations, a record is one Detail
AFGSCI21-118 1 DECEMBER 2009                                                                   17

Data Record (DDR). When a DDR contains more than one documentation error, the JDD error
rate will reflect one error for the entire DDR. Report the uncorrected error rate.
Logistics—This term, when used in reference to aircraft maintenance, will consider anything
concerning maintenance, weapons, supply, transportation, plans or contracting.
Maintenance/Operations (MX/OPS) Deviation Rate -- The number of maintenance and
operations deviations divided by adjusted sorties scheduled multiplied by 100. Reflects the
number of deviations within unit control. The MX/OPS deviation rate is a subset of FSE. Only
count the MX/OPS deviations used to compute the FSE rate.
Mission Capable (MC) Rate—The percent of possessed time an aircraft/system is partially or
fully mission capable.
Not Mission Capable Maintenance (NMCM) Rate—The percent of possessed time an
aircraft/system is not mission capable due to maintenance (NMCM).
Not Mission Capable Supply (NMCS) Rate—The percent of possessed time an aircraft/system
is not mission capable due to supply (NMCS).
Not Mission Capable Both (NMCB) Rate—The percent of possessed time an aircraft/system is
not mission capable due to both maintenance and supply (NMCB).
Operational Check Flight (OCF)—The first flight of an aircraft that has had extended
downtime or extensive maintenance which does not require an FCF.
Overall Base Repair Cycle Processing Time—The total time in days for an unserviceable asset
to be repaired on base or sent Not Repairable This Station (NRTS) to another repair agency. It
starts when the replacement part is issued by the flightline parts store (or Base Supply) and ends
when the asset is returned serviceable to the part store’s shelf or is sent NRTS to another repair
agency. Overall Repair Cycle Processing Time and narratives are obtained from the Supply Due
In For Maintenance (DIFM) Monitor.
Percent Of Assigned Aircraft Within 30 Percent Of No Remaining Time—The percent of
assigned aircraft within 30 percent of inspection time.
Primary Aerospace Vehicle Authorized (PAA)—Aircraft authorized for performance of the
unit’s mission (e.g. Combat, Combat Support, Training, Test and Evaluation, etc…). The PAA
forms the basis for the allocation of operating resources to include manpower, support
equipment, and flying hour funds. The operating command determines the PAA required to meet
their assigned missions.
Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI)—Aircraft assigned to meet primary aircraft authorization.
(Includes PDAI, PMAI, POAI, and PTAI.)
Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI)—Aircraft assigned to a unit for performance of
its wartime mission (Possession codes: CA, CC).
Primary Training Aircraft Inventory (PTAI)—Aircraft required primarily for technical and
specialized training of crew personnel or leading to aircrew qualification (Possession code: TF).
Primary Development/Test Aircraft Inventory (PDAI)—Aircraft assigned primarily for the
test of the aircraft or its components for purposes of research, development, test and evaluation,
operational test and evaluation, or support for testing programs (Possession code: CB).
Primary Other Aircraft Inventory (POAI)—Aircraft required for special missions not
elsewhere classified.
Reconstitution Reserve—Aircraft stored or on the ramp which are planned for return to the
operating forces in the event of mobilization, replacement, or reconstitution.
18                                                          AFGSCI21-118 1 DECEMBER 2009

Recur Rate—A recurring discrepancy on an aircraft occurs on the second through fourth sortie
or attempted sortie after corrective action has been taken and the system or subsystem is used.
The discrepancy must indicate the same malfunction as the original.
Repeat Rate—A repeat discrepancy on an aircraft occurs on the next sortie or attempted sortie
after corrective action has been taken and the system or subsystem is used. The discrepancy must
indicate the same malfunction as the original.
Scheduled Sortie—An aircraft scheduled for flight by tail number on the weekly flying schedule
and confirmed on the daily flying schedule. Incentive flights are considered scheduled sorties
and published in the weekly schedule. Functional Check Flights (FCF) and Operational Check
Flights (OCF) are excluded.
Sortie—A sortie begins when an aircraft becomes airborne or takes off vertically from rest at
any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when the aircraft returns to the surface except
for continuation sorties and: a) the engines are stopped, or b) the aircraft is on the surface for 5
minutes, whichever occurs first between a and b, or c) a change is made in the crew.
Sortie Attempts—Includes sorties flown and ground aborts.
Sortie UTE Rate—The average sorties flown per authorized/chargeable aircraft per month.

A2.10.1. Total Sorties Scheduled = Total Sorties Flown + Cancellations - Additions.
A2.10.2. For RCS: AFGSC-A4M 9302 reporting purposes, total deviations include all deviations
in the given category. Those deviations considered FSE computable are entered in the FSE
column. AFGSCI 21-165 provides guidance on these deviations. For example, a scheduled line
that ground aborts and is subsequently filled with a spare aircraft is not counted in the deviations
portion of this formula. The ground abort does count toward the Ground Abort and Total Abort
rates. If a scheduled line that ground aborts is not filled by a spare aircraft, the lost sortie is a
deviation and is counted toward FSE. The abort is also included in the Ground Abort and Total
Abort rates.
A2.10.3. Adjusted Sorties Scheduled = Sum of all scheduled sorties (home base, off station or
deployed) Minus UTE cancellations.
A2.10.4. Calculated Deviations = Sum of all deviations minus air deviations, aircraft
interchanges, aircraft spare actions, ground aborted sorties flown by spare aircraft (on-time), and
UTE cancellations.
A2.10.5. OP/MT-Deviations = Sum of all Calculated Deviations recorded using OP_ or MT_ as
the deviation cause code (include GAA, GAB and GAC).

COMMENTS: This is the chance to tell your unit's story. Include analysis of top drivers, bad
actors, or problem aircraft. Include AMU/CC's comments and explain any events that may have
affected unit performance (e.g. deployments, stand-downs, training, exercises, etc…). Example:
MC rates dropped slightly primarily due to a supply spike this month. The TNMCM rate held
steady. Phase Inspections continue to be the main driver fleet-wide due to an influx of 3-level
personnel and qualified technicians currently deployed. The only other systems that stood out
were an increase in Electrics and Airframe work. After 5 months of steady improvements, supply
rates increased in April. The Engine Monitor Display (EMD) and the Head-Up Display (HUD)
continue to be our leading MICAP drivers. A shortage of Faceplate Assemblies has hampered
repair of the Engine Monitor Displays but we are starting to see relief from the new contract that
was awarded in January. A lack of Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) has impacted HUD repair. UTE
execution was low because of reduced home station sortie generation capability due to Operation
Northern Watch.

ITEM 28A. MX/OPS DEVIATIONS (MX/OPS DEVIATION RATE OUT OF
STANDARD). List top five categories and type deviations for each category. You are required
to provide narrative outlining reasons for deviations to include trends. Do not look at one month
of data for trend information. Review previous months to determine if deviation causes are a
trend. Do not repeat this section (listing drivers) if the MX and OPS drivers were listed in Item
28. You only need to provide comments if the drivers were not previously listed.

COMMENTS: See the comment section under the MC Rate above. Example: There was a
noticeable increase in Hydraulic System aborts. Maintenance replaced 8 hydraulic pumps this
month. The main area of concern was aircraft 1234. It had three ground aborts for number 2
engine no start. After the first two aborts, maintenance was performed and the engine checked
good for three to five ground starts with no subsequent failures. After the third ground abort, the
aircraft was impounded. A dedicated troubleshooting team was unable to duplicate the condition
until the sixth ground start attempt. Extensive troubleshooting by maintenance technicians and
technical service representatives could not pinpoint a problem, though the engine failed to start
on three consecutive attempts. The engine was replaced and the aircraft has flown twice.

COMMENTS: See the comment section under the MC Rate above. Example: The primary
driver of our fix rates is a lack of experienced technicians with good trouble shooting abilities.
We are 40% manned in TSgt Crew Chiefs and 80% in SSgt Crew Chiefs. Hence, we have to
grow our own experience and take time to teach proper trouble-shooting. Although the breaks
are taking longer to fix, they are fixed properly as seen by our low repeat/recur rate.

COMMENTS: See the comment section under the MC Rate above. The repeat-recur rate is a
measure of system reliability and quality of maintenance. When addressing repeat-recur drivers
focus on component failures, maintenance processes, i.e., troubleshooting and actual fixes,
internal and external pressure to commit aircraft to flying schedule, as well as lack of
experienced qualified or trained technicians.
