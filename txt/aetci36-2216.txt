               Paragraph Changes Within Body of AETCI 36-2216, 6 Dec 2010
This instruction applies to training locations aligned under Second Air Force (2 AF), HQ
AETC/A2/3/10 OPCON, and technical training courses located at Air University and the 59th
Medical Wing (59 MDW). It applies to Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) members attending technical and flying training. Throughout this instruction,
aircrew member students are defined as students attending any 1AXXX 3-skill-level awarding
course or aircrew qualification course at an Air Force base aligned under HQ AETC/A2/3/10.
Basic military training (BMT), officer and prior service enlisted aircrew training, the Inter-
American Air Forces Academy, and the Defense Language Institute at Lackland AFB TX will
comply only with paragraph 15. Commanders at these locations must also ensure students meet
all Air Force requirements for standards and discipline. Wing commanders may temporarily
exempt students from Transition Program requirements when conditions are deemed unsafe
(such as temporary hazards and any extreme weather conditions or warnings). The responsible
commander may also exempt any student participating in simulators, flights, or hot training from
duty hour, physical training (PT), meal, and transportation provisions of this instruction for those
days where crew rest instructions take precedence. All non-2 AF units will send waiver requests,
suggested changes, and proposed supplements to HQ AETC/A3PV, 1 F Street, Suite 2, Randolph
AFB TX 78150-4325, for consideration, review, and approval.
4.1. Group commanders will ensure a standard template, Points of Contact for Students and
Trainees, is displayed on Airmen bulletin boards in military training flights (MTF) and
dormitory areas. This document encourages Airmen to follow the chain of command to resolve
issues. The standard template will include phone numbers for the following: First Sergeant,
Squadron Commander, Chaplain, Inspector General, Equal Opportunity Office, Behavioral
Health, Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC) Hotline, the Air Force Discrimination
Hotline, the Legal Assistance Office, AF Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), Security
Forces, and additional command hotlines as applicable (2 AF Abuse Hotline, wing hotlines, etc).
4.2. Units will obtain the standard template, Points of Contact for Students and Trainees from the
2 AF MTL website. Each unit will fill in local phone numbers, print the template on 8 1/2- by
11-inch bond paper (portrait style), and frame it for display (unless it is being posted on a
bulletin board). Do not print the document in color. Note: Units may customize the template to
include their emblem in the upper right-hand corner, aligned with the AETC shield. They may
also use their word processor to type in applicable phone numbers into the template. Other than
these provisions, units will not redesign the standard look and feel of the template.
5.5. Officer students are required to perform PT three times a week. One class or group PT
activity per week will be accomplished. PT sessions will consist of strength training, 30 minutes
of aerobic activity, and stretching exercises. If a student is unable to complete PT activity during
the week, he or she will be required to complete this requirement during off-duty time or on the
weekend and record it. The class senior-ranking officer will certify the PT activity in the
logbook. Battlefield Airman (BA) officers will adhere to course PT requirements.
5.6. Officer students who become due for their Air Force fitness assessment while in training
will be tested by their training squadron. Students are required to receive an Air Force fitness
assessment composite score of >75 points. Students not achieving the target composite score will
be entered into an appropriate fitness improvement program.
6.2.4. Will ensure that when MTLs counsel NPS Airmen, one-on-one in private (i.e., closed
door), will have another permanent party staff member of the same gender as the NPS Airmen
present. Furthermore, ensure alternative corrective measures (verbal counseling, training
sessions, RTP, and mandatory curfew) are used before advancing to formally documented
actions unless advancing directly to a formally documented action is appropriate under the
particular facts and circumstances. Note: Remember the gravity of formal documentation in
training is no less severe than in operational units.
6.2.6. (Added) Will initiate either removal of the SDI from the member or waiver package if an
MTL fails to meet the requirements for retention IAW the 8B100 AFECD. 2 AF units will route
waiver packages through the 2 AF/CC for decision. Non-2 AF units will route waiver packages
through the HQ AETC A2/3/10 Director.
6.2.7. (Added) Will consult with local SJA prior to disposition of all allegations of student
maltreatment, maltraining, hazing, fraternization, sexual assault, unprofessional or inappropriate
relationships.
6.2.8. (Added) Will brief the Technical Training Commander’s Arrival Briefing during
Commander’s Inprocessing. Units must use the attached, Technical Training Commander’s
Arrival Briefing, when conducting this briefing. Note: This may be conducted at the wing,
group, or squadron commander level.
6.6.1.1. Reporting procedures will be performed as follows: Airmen will assume the position of
attention and will use specific rank, and last name to open a conversation. Once acknowledged,
Airman will assume the position of parade rest and use “Sir/Ma’am” or any proper term of
address (such as, “Sergeant” or “Chief”) throughout the remainder of the conversation. Airmen
must return to the position of attention after the conversation and execute a proper facing
movement when departing. They will address civilian staff personnel as either “Mr. /Ms.” or
“Sir/Ma’am.” These procedures will be performed while addressing any permanent party
member in the training area. Note: IAW AFMAN 36-2203, there is no such command as "stand-
by" where a person immediately assumes the position of parade rest and waits for another
command. To execute rest positions, you must first be at the position of attention.
6.6.15. MTL Flight Chief and First Sergeant will initial all formal documentation (LOC, LOA,
LOR) prior to being placed in CTF. All formal documentation will be filed in airman’s
Collateral Training Folder (CTF) regardless of where it originates. In addition, file formal
documentation in any other system of record as applicable. Note: Remember the gravity of
formal documentation in training is no less severe than in operational units. Ensure Air Reserve
Component (ARC) training liaisons are notified and sent documentation when Airmen commit
offenses or incidents resulting in disciplinary actions.
7.2. Airmen who relocate because of reclassification or to attend follow-on training courses will
remain in their current transition period. Furthermore, Airmen who are removed from transition
periods will remain in their removed status. Airmen will remain on base until they receive an
initial orientation briefing, which may be provided orally or in writing.
7.4. Airmen will pass all transition requirements (open ranks, room inspections, etc.) prior to
being transitioned. MTLs will track the completion of training requirements for transition
advancement. MTLs will meet with Airmen who fail to meet all transition requirements to
discuss their failure to progress and document the session.
7.7.1. Airmen may rent or visit on- or off-base/post lodging, housing, or apartments with written
approval of the assistant flight chief or higher. ANG members must coordinate with the liaison
before entering into a lease agreement. Note: This approval is for temporary accommodations,
not permanent living quarters while attending academic training.
7.18.4. MTLs will post/brief uniform of the day that establishes the standard for students whether
marching in or out of a formation. When marching in a formation, Airmen will be in the same
uniform (e.g. sleeves up, sleeves down or PTU jackets on, jackets off). In a given formation
uniforms will not be mixed, e.g. some in PT uniform while some in uniform of the day.
7.20.2. . NPS Airmen who are removed from transition periods will be housed separately and
restricted from residing in dormitories housing NPS Airmen who remain in transition periods.
Exceptions must be approved, in writing, by the training/operations group commander. If an
exception is approved, Airmen who have been removed from transition periods will be
physically separated from NPS Airmen who remain in transition periods by the most appropriate
means (for example, a different floor or wing of a building).
7.21. NPS AFRC/ANG Airmen who are sent home between BMT graduation and the beginning
of technical training (awaiting class start date, funds, etc.) will be entered into a transition period
upon arrival at training. NPS AFRC/ANG Airmen will remain in a transition period and the NPS
dormitory until departure of 2 AF technical training, graduation from the transition program, or
completion of aircrew qualification courses aligned under HQ AETC/A2/3/10.
7.22. NPS Airmen are not normally authorized to take ordinary leave (EXCEPTION: Holiday
Exodus). In rare circumstances, the group commander may approve leave for Airmen. (The
group commander may delegate this authority to the squadron or detachment commander.)
Leave for ARC members will be coordinated through the appropriate ARC Liaison Office for
procedural guidance. When leave is authorized, Airmen will receive a pre-departure safety
briefing, which will be documented on AETC Form 29B, Predeparture Safety Briefing,
prescribed in the AETC Sup to AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.
Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
7.24.1. (Added) MTLs should not contact NPS Airmen in any way upon graduation from
Technical School until the entire training pipeline is completed, they have arrived at their first
permanent duty station, and they have been in the AF for more than 180 days except for official
reasons. When an MTL must counsel an NPS Airmen one-on-one in private (i.e., closed door),
another permanent party staff member of the same gender as the NPS Airmen will be present.
MTLs must ensure their relationship with any student/trainee/counselee/entry-level status
Airman remains professional.
7.26. Per AFI 36-2903, AETC Sup, Pagers, cellular phones, personal digital assistants, two-way
radios, MP3 players, or any other electronic devices are prohibited for NPS Airmen during the
academic day while in uniform. Electronic listening devices (e.g. IPods) may be worn during PT
on a closed running course or while at the gym while wearing the PTU.
9.4. Alcohol Possession/Consumption.
9.4.1. (Added) Airmen of legal age will not possess or consume alcohol in the dormitory or
immediate surrounding area. The unit commander will specify in writing the definition of
"immediate surrounding area".
9.4.2. (Added) Airmen who choose to drink alcohol will do so responsibly and not bring
discredit to the Air Force, in or out of uniform. Wing commanders may be more restrictive, in
writing, to this alcohol consumption privilege by extending an alcohol restriction (multiple
members in mass or for specific individuals) for up to 150 consecutive calendar days. Note:
This may not be delegated. (Exception: The 381 TRG/CC and 336 TRG/CC will approve
exceptions for their respective groups.)
9.6. Will adhere to call to quarters of 2200 to 0400 on evenings prior to duty days.
Training/operations group commanders will impose, in writing, call to quarters as determined
between the hours of 2200 to 0400 on evenings prior to non-duty days (e.g. the group
commander decides to impose a call to quarters from 0100 to 0400 on Saturday and Sunday,
etc.). Note: Training/operations group commanders will determine, in writing, call to quarters
for Airmen assigned to shifts other than a traditional day shift. Additionally, in all shift
situations, this authority cannot be delegated below the group commander.
9.12. (Added) Training/operations group commanders and deputies, in writing, may return ATP
Airmen into ITP based on an infraction whereas additional measures are deemed necessary to
emphasize the importance of Air Force values to an Airman. While not all inclusive, infraction
examples include underage drinking, contributing to underage drinking, alcohol in the dormitory,
missed CQ appointments, off-installation violations, etc. Return into ITP will last for a
mandatory 30 consecutive calendar days. Squadron, GSU, and Det commanders will counsel
(document via AF Form 174, Record of Individual Counseling) NPS Airmen prior to returning
the Airman to ITP. First Sergeants and MTLs will initial and place the AF Form 174 in the CTF.
Note: Commanders can only return NPS Airmen into ITP once during the Airmen’s duration of
technical training. This may not be delegated. Exception: Wear of military uniform will not be
mandated off-duty if returned to ITP.
10. Remedial Transition Period (RTP) Requirements and Restrictions. RTP begins when an
Airman’s performance falls below standards evidenced by failing 2 successive room and/or
uniform inspections, and/or 2 or more related 341s for discrepancy and other corrective actions
are ineffective or not warranted. The RTP is a temporary measure tailored to raise performance
to meet standards. Normally NPS Airmen will not remain in the RTP for more than 15 calendar
days. EXCEPTION: The military training flight chief may extend additional time as required
with proper documentation; however, RTP will not exceed 30 consecutive days. RTP will be
documented on Remedial Transition Period Memo, template attached. File each completed RTP
Memo in the Airman’s CTF. Do not use RTP when member is pending Article 15, court-martial
action or investigations being conducted by OSI or SF.
11.13. MTFs must maintain a military training bulletin board in a central location. This board
will be posted with the following visual aids: AETCVA 36-2, AETC Policy on Equal
Opportunity; the standard template, Points of Contact for Students and Trainees; AETCVA 90-
301, AETC IG Complaints Resolution Poster; and AFVA 10-2510, U.S. Air Force Emergency
Notification Signals (or sister-service equivalent). All MTF bulletin boards must be maintained
in a professional manner. Posted information will be reviewed and kept current. The information
will be displayed neatly.
13.2.3. Ensure each Airman receives the dietary supplement (DS) hazards information presented
in Attachment 3, and the signed and dated memo at Attachment 3 is filed in the Airman’s CTF.
Additional information on DS use may be found
at: http://champ.usuhs.mil/pdf/DietarySupplementsGuide.pdf.
13.3. MTLs will ensure each Airman receives a newcomers’ safety briefing as directed by AFI
91- 202 and document the briefing on AETC Form 29A, Commander's Newcomers' Safety
Briefing. The briefing will ensure Airmen understand the AETC High-Risk Activities Program.
In addition, Airmen who wish to participate in high-risk activities will have an activity-specific,
one-on-one briefing that will be documented on AETC Form 410, High Risk Activities
Worksheet. (AETC Form 29A and AETC Form 410 are prescribed in AFI 91-202 AETC Sup 1.
Refer to that publication for guidance filling out the forms.)
14.1. Ensure each Airman receives a pre-departure safety briefing in accordance with the AETC
Form 29B. A completed copy of this form will be filed in each Airman’s CTF upon departure.
14.3. The losing MTF will transfer CTF information to the gaining MTF for NPS Airmen being
reclassified or proceeding to follow-on technical training. No later than 24 hours prior to the
Airman’s departure, the MTL will forward a copy of the AETC Form 29B with travel itinerary to
the gaining MTF. The gaining MTF must notify the losing MTF of arrival within 24 hours.
15.3. For flying training units under HQ AETC/A2/3/10, MT procedures are only authorized as
reflected in approved supplements to this instruction. These training procedures will be
reviewed and approved annually by the applicable group, wing, and HQ AETC/A2/3/10 Training
Pipeline Manager.
18.1. The purpose of an Airman leader is to assist MTLs, improve Airman morale, and enhance
personal leadership skills. Airman leaders supervise or monitor personnel assigned to their
squadron or placed under their charge. Airmen leaders have the authority to pull an AETC Form
341 from any NPS Airman and turn it into their squadron MTL. Airmen First Class will be
considered first to perform Airman leader duties before looking at other ranks. If the Airman
leader requirement exceeds the number of assigned A1Cs, or if an A1C is ineligible, then
Airman leaders may be selected from the ranks of Airman and, subsequently, Airman Basic until
the requirement can be filled with qualified A1Cs. Ineligibility for A1Cs will be documented on
AETC Form 77, Airman Leader Application/Certification. Note: Airman’s disinterest does not
qualify for an ineligibility reason.
23.3. The ARCs will select highly qualified personnel to serve as training liaisons and ANG
liaisons are assigned at 37 TRW, Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA) Lackland TX; 82 TRW,
Sheppard AFB TX; 81 TRW, Keesler AFB MS while AFRC liaisons are assigned directly to HQ
AFRC. ARC Training Liaison assigned to 8B100 Special Duty Identifier (SDI) will attend the
initial qualification course provided by 37 TRG at Lackland AFB TX prior to being awarded the
blue aiguillette. The respective ARC headquarters (NGB/A1DC or HQ AFRC/A1K) is
responsible for the training and day-to-day management of ARC training liaisons. However,
these training liaisons are encouraged to take advantage of training opportunities at their
respective locations.

                     Technical Training Commander’s Arrival Briefing

1. Be aware, MTIs should not contact you in any way upon graduation from BMT or upon
arrival here at technical training, except for official reasons. You will ensure your relationships
with MTIs, MTLs, faculty and staff, to include DoD and international personnel, either military
or civilian, are professional. These professional relationships should continue throughout your
entire period of training or instruction received here in technical training. If any of these
individuals must counsel you one-on-one in private (i.e., closed door) another permanent party
staff member of the same gender as you will be present. Furthermore, you must maintain these
professional relationships until you report to your permanent duty station of assignment and have
been in the AF for more than 180 days.

2. Similarly, you will not establish, develop, attempt to develop or conduct a social, personal,
intimate or sexual relationship with MTIs, MTLs, faculty or staff. This includes, but is not
limited to dating, handholding, kissing, embracing, caressing and engaging in sexual activities.
Prohibited personal, intimate or sexual relationships include those unprofessional relationships,
which are conducted in person and/or via cards, letters, e-mails, telephone calls, social media
(e.g., Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, YouTube), photographs and any other means of
communication.

3. If an MTI, MTL, faculty or staff member attempts to contact you for other than official
business, immediately contact your squadron commander, first sergeant or the Sexual Assault
Response Coordinator (SARC) at XXX-XXXX, or [insert additional hotlines as applicable; e.g.
2 AF Abuse Hotline at DSN: 487-4007 or commercial: (210)-652-4007]

This instruction implements and extends the guidance in AFPD 36-22, Air Force Military
Training. It establishes procedures and responsibilities for training in military standards and
discipline for non-prior service (NPS) enlisted and officer students in initial skills resident
training courses. This instruction applies to training locations aligned under Second Air Force (2
AF), Nineteenth Air Force (19 AF), and technical training courses located at Air University and
the 59th Medical Wing (59 MDW). It applies to Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) members attending technical and flying training. Throughout this
instruction, aircrew member students are defined as students attending any 1AXXX 3 skill-level
awarding course. Basic military training (BMT), officer and prior service enlisted aircrew
training, the Inter-American Air Forces Academy, and the Defense Language Institute at
Lackland AFB TX will comply only with paragraph 15. Commanders at these locations must
also ensure students meet all Air Force requirements for standards and discipline. Wing
commanders may temporarily exempt students from Transition Period requirements when
conditions are deemed unsafe (such as temporary hazards and any extreme weather conditions or
warnings). The responsible commander may also exempt any student participating in simulators,
flights, or hot training from duty hour, PT, meal, and transportation provisions of this instruction
for those days where crew rest instructions take precedence.

Commanders responsible for implementing this instruction may supplement it to establish
specific implementing procedures including clock hour adjustments for different shifts. Any
training and/or operations group, geographically separated unit (GSU), operating location (OL),
or detachment (Det) may request a waiver of any portion of this instruction on a case-by-case
basis. A waiver must be submitted when commanders want to modify (add or restrict) Airmen’s

Section A—Introduction

1. Standards and Discipline. Training and/or operations group commanders will ensure all
graduates meet Air Force requirements of standards and discipline. Note: Items permitting
training/operations group commanders latitude to determine requirements, in writing, will be
determined by 59 TRS/CC for the 59 MDW and 82 TRW/CC, through 82 TRW/TO for the 82
TRW. Programs will be designed to reinforce training initiated during BMT and officer training
and to continually emphasize core values, equal opportunity and treatment, and environmental
awareness. Failure to observe prohibitions and mandatory provisions of this publication in
paragraphs 7 through 11 by NPS Airmen is a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of
Military Justice (UCMJ).
2. Purpose and Objectives. Military training adapts non-prior service (NPS) Airmen and
officer students to military life and provides the Air Force with highly trained, motivated, self-
disciplined, and physically fit Airmen with exceptional military bearing. Each training and/or
operations group will implement a core program that includes the following elements:
   2.1. Military customs, courtesies, and traditions. See paragraph 3 of this instruction.
   2.2. A military training standard for officers (MTSO). See Section B of this instruction.
   2.3. A military training standard for NPS enlisted (MTSE) personnel. See Section C of this
   instruction.
   2.4. A military training leader (MTL) program. See Section D of this instruction.
3. Military Customs, Courtesies, and Traditions. Officers and enlisted personnel will be
taught that customs, courtesies, and traditions play a time-honored role in the military profession
and serve as an integral part in their development as professionals and future leaders. Group
commanders will establish a program of activities that reinforces traditional military customs and
courtesies and motivates and prepares officers and enlisted personnel for future leadership roles.
This program may include parades, retreats, Airman reviews, and/or open ranks inspections
based on Airman load and training requirements.
4. Points of Contact for Students:
   4.1. Group commanders will ensure AETCVA 36-6, Points of Contact for Students and
   Trainees, is displayed on Airmen bulletin boards in military training flights (MTF) and
   dormitory areas. This visual aid encourages Airmen to follow the chain of command to
   resolve issues.
 6                                                           AETC36-2216 6 DECEMBER 2010


     4.2. Units can obtain an electronic version of AETCVA 36-6 from the MTL CoP web site at
     https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO
     -ED-AE-51-1&Filter=OO-ED-AE-51. Each unit will fill in local phone numbers, print the
     visual aid on 8 1/2- by 11-inch bond paper (portrait style), and frame it for display (unless it
     is being posted on a bulletin board). Do not print the visual aid in color. Note: Units may
     customize AETCVA 36-6 to include their emblem in the upper right-hand corner, aligned
     with the AETC shield. However, they will not redesign the visual aid.

Section B—Military Training Standard for Officers (MTSO)

5. Requirements:
     5.1. Officers are expected to maintain high standards of bearing and behavior and
     demonstrate a professional attitude toward superiors and subordinates.
     5.2. Squadron commanders will ensure officers comply with their responsibilities, to include
     Air Force and AETC policies on fraternization, and unprofessional relationships IAW
     AETCI 36-2909, Professional and Unprofessional Relationships, physical wellness, and
     military standards and training.
     5.3. Physical training (PT) is designed to help students cope with the rigors of the training
     environment and improve their physical condition to meet the standards specified in AFI 36-
     2905, Fitness Program. Group sporting events such as volleyball, softball, etc., may be
     considered for esprit de corps, but not for a group PT program.
     5.4. Squadron commanders are responsible for the overall administration of the PT program
     and will maintain a logbook for courses where PT is not part of the course. They will brief
     students on the benefits of PT as part of new class orientation.
     5.5. Officer students are required to perform PT three times a week. One class or group PT
     activity per week will be accomplished. PT sessions will consist of strength training, 30
     minutes of aerobic activity, and stretching exercises. If a student is unable to complete PT
     activity during the week, he or she will be required to complete this requirement during off-
     duty time or on the weekend and record it. The class senior-ranking officer will certify the
     PT activity in the logbook. (ANG members will comply with applicable ANG instructions.)
     Battlefield Airman (BA) officers will adhere to course PT requirements.
     5.6. Officer students who become due for their Air Force fitness assessment while in training
     will be tested by their training squadron. Students are required to receive an Air Force

MEMORANDUM FOR STUDENTS
FROM: XX TRG/CC
SUBJECT: Dietary Supplement Hazards

1. Due to the possibility of heat injuries associated with dietary supplement use in conjunction
with the physically demanding training environment, it is highly recommended that as a student
in training you refrain from using any dietary supplement (DS) that could cause or increase the
risk of suffering a medical condition (i.e., dehydration, increased blood pressure, seizures, etc.)
associated with such supplements.
2. Dietary supplements can be marketed and sold without scientific proof of safety,
effectiveness, ingredient purity, precise supplement composition, and lack of contaminants.
Many DS have side effect profiles similar to those of controlled, prescription medications.
Further, recent research on DS has shown that most have little or no health benefit, while being
able to produce serious side effects in some users. Due the risks that DS pose to training
capability and mission readiness, it is highly recommended that you do not use any DS. This
recommendation applies to all products and/or ingredients specifically marketed to induce
weight loss, gain muscle mass, boost energy and enhance performance. As an Airman in
training, it is recommended that you only use DS that have been prescribed or administered by a
military medical professional, multi-vitamins, or protein only supplements (in which the only
active ingredient is soy, whey, or casein protein).
3. If you decide to take a DS other than the ones listed above, you are required to notify your
MTL prior to taking the DS. The reason for this requirement is so your academic instructors or
MTL can notify medical professionals if you suffer from a medical condition and cannot inform
a medical professional due to unconsciousness or delirium. If you fail to disclose the use of DS,
you will be in violation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), Failure to Obey
Order or Regulation. Unauthorized DS use may result in discipline action under the UCMJ
and/or administration action, including discharge from the United States Air Force.
