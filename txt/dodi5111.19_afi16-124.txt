228   Staff, in addition to the responsibilities in section 5 of this enclosure, shall:
229
230      a. Review proposals and provide military advice to the USD(P) to contribute to the policy
231   oversight of use of the section 1206 authority. Coordinate with the Combatant Commands to
232   ensure that field-identified concerns are addressed during the annual program selection and
233   congressional notification processes.
234
235       b. Request that the Geographic Combatant Commanders (GCCs) complete the identification
236   of requirements for selected programs, according to specifics identified by DSCA and the Military
237   Departments, during feasibility assessments and pseudo-FMS case development.
238
239   8. GCCs. The GCCs, in addition to the responsibilities in section 5 of this enclosure, shall:
240
241      a. Jointly develop annual section 1206 program proposals with embassy country teams and
242   security cooperation organizations.
243
244       b. Task security cooperation officers (SCOs) to develop a needs assessment for section 1206
245   programs. The assessment is a critical part of the section 1206 program strategy. The partner
246   nation (PN) helps the SCO determine the level of support required and the sustainability
247   requirements for the articles being provided.
248
249      c. Task the SCOs to work with the PN to develop a concept of operations for each
250   SecDef-approved program, which must be submitted to the Joint Staff within 6 months of program
251   approval.
252
253       d. Coordinate the program proposal development process among theater SCOs in accordance
254   with this Instruction, the annual guidance issued by the OUSD(P), and the annual programmatic
255   guidance memorandum issued by DSCA. At a minimum, program proposals should be
256   formulated based on the Guidance for the Employment of the Force (Reference (i)), DoD
257   Contingency Plan (CONPLAN) 7500-06 (Reference (j)), theater security cooperation plans, and
258   the applicable country team’s mission strategic plan (MSP). Program proposals require the
259   concurrence of the COM, which must be provided via a cable to the DOS Bureau of Democracy,
260   Human Rights, and Labor.
261
262       e. Provide the Joint Staff J-5 with a prioritized list of program proposals for the given fiscal
263   year cycle. Should GCCs need to submit an urgent or emergent, out-of-cycle proposal, they must
264   indicate the priority of the new proposal relative to the respective original prioritized program list.
265
266      f. Develop, as part of the development of program proposals and in conjunction with the SCO,
267   quantitative and qualitative measures of performance to assess the progress and success of the
268   programs, and forward them to the Joint Staff J-5 within 6 months of program approval.
269
270      g. For approved programs, verify with SCOs that Leahy human rights vetting requirements
271   have been met in accordance with Reference (d) and section 620J of the Foreign Assistance Act of
272   1961, as amended (Reference (e)), and human rights training as required for each section 1206
273   program have been conducted.

274
275      h. Provide assessments of and recommend modifications to DoD section 1206 authority.
276
277      i. For approved programs, direct SCOs to coordinate with DSCA and the applicable Military
278   Department supporting agency to track closely the procurement, shipment, and delivery of
279   requested equipment or the scheduling of designated training.
280
281      j. Upon the request of the Joint Staff J-5, resolve issues regarding the definition of
282   requirements for selected programs, according to specifics identified by DSCA and the Military
283   Departments during feasibility assessments and pseudo-FMS case development.
284
285   9. DIRECTOR, DEFENSE INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL LEGAL STUDIES (DIILS).
286   The Director, DIILS, under the authority, direction, and control of the Director, DSCA, shall:
287
288      a. Implement a human rights element (e.g., training) for all SecDef-approved programs as
289   required by section 1206.
290
291       b. Develop and forward to country teams a curriculum covering the required section 1206
292   subjects, which include observance of and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and
293   respect for legitimate civilian authority, and the related topic of the law of armed conflict (law of
294   war). Country teams will be invited to review the DIILS curriculum and to work with DIILS to
295   tailor the curriculum, as needed.
296
297       c. Work with country teams to identify requirements for human rights training events. Draft
298   surveys that identify details including participating units, number of personnel, training location,
299   and desired time frame for conducting the training seminars. The surveys will also seek
300   assistance in identifying and scheduling DIILS-funded translators, providing logistics support
301   (including meals), and the time frame for the follow-on training event.
302
303       d. Provide country teams with curriculum that the ASD(SO/LIC&IC) and GC, DoD have
304   identified as required on the topics of observance of and respect for human rights and fundamental
305   freedoms and respect for legitimate civilian authority, which may include instruction on the law of
306   armed conflict (law of war).
307
308       e. Invite country teams to propose for consideration by DIILS additional curriculum on these
309   topics, and modification of curriculum as appropriate to accommodate local circumstances, to the
310   extent that such modifications do not delete or detract from required content. Provide this
311   additional or modified curriculum to the training audience when appropriate. The training
312   audience will include unit commanders, key staff, and noncommissioned officers, as appropriate.
313   Country teams may invite other military personnel and civilians of military forces or maritime
314   security forces to attend such training, subject to training space and resource availability.
315
316       f. Request country team confirmation that requirements for human rights vetting have been
317   met for all participants. Current Department of State-DoD guidance (Reference (l)) provides
318   human rights vetting guidance for DoD assistance, participants vetted within the past 12 months
319   for other purposes do not need to be vetted a second time to participate in the training.

321      g. Keep an up-to-date database that tracks surveys completed, in addition to any seminars
322   completed, and provide weekly reports to the ASD(SO/LIC&IC).
323
324   10. COMMANDER, U.S. TRANSPORTATION COMMAND (USTRANSCOM). The
325   Commander, USTRANSCOM, shall:
326
327      a. Execute the transportation of all section 1206-funded defense articles through the Defense
328   Transportation System, as requested.
329
330      b. Facilitate improvements to transportation processes with the ASD(SO/LIC & IC) and
331   Director, DSCA, as necessary in view of the importance of SecDef-approved section 1206
332   programs.

                                         ENCLOSURE 3

                                    PROGRAM GUIDELINES


1. GCCs and COMs will lead the annual section 1206 proposal submission effort, with Military
Departments and other DoD Components in support.

2. Section 1206 funds may only be used:

    a. To train and equip a foreign country’s national military forces, i.e., forces under the
authority of the Ministry of Defense (MOD), in order for that country to conduct counterterrorism
operations or participate in or support military and stability operations in which U.S. Armed
Forces are participating; or

   b. To build the capacity of a foreign country’s maritime security forces (including non-MOD
elements) to conduct counterterrorism operations.

3. Section 1206 funding may not be used to provide assistance that is otherwise prohibited by any
provision of law.

4. Congress has indicated that section 1206 assistance for military and stability operations should
be used to train and equip partner nations with a demonstrated need for assistance in third theaters,
such as Iraq or Afghanistan. (See section 10 of this enclosure.)

5. Programs shall comply with Leahy human rights vetting requirements, in accordance with
Reference (d) and section 620J of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (Reference (e)).
No assistance shall be provided to units that would otherwise be restricted, either legally or by
policy, from receiving security assistance. All units scheduled to receive training or equipment
provided in accordance with Reference (c) shall be vetted in accordance with DoD and DOS Leahy
human rights vetting requirements not more than 12 months before provision of such assistance.
DOS shall conduct the vetting in coordination with the country team.

6. Countries that are otherwise prohibited from receiving the proposed training and equipping
assistance (pursuant to, for example, section 7101 of Reference (e), also known as “The Victims of
Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000;” section 7012 of Public Law 111-117, also
known as “The Brooke Amendment” (Reference (k)); section 7008 of Reference (k), also known
as “The Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Act, 2010;” and
successor provisions restricting assistance to any country whose duly elected head of government
has been deposed in a coup) may not be included in section 1206 programs.

7. A pseudo LOA or a pseudo FMS case is used by the Department of Defense to track the sale of
defense articles and services under section 1206. The pseudo LOA itemizes the defense articles
and services to be provided pursuant to a program plan approved by the Secretary of Defense with


                                                 13                                ENCLOSURE 3
                  DRAFT—NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR COMPLIANCE


the concurrence of the Secretary of State and after congressional notification in accordance with
section 1206. Although pseudo-FMS cases use many of the traditional FMS procedures, these
cases are subject to unique policy requirements to ensure the cases are developed and managed
according to the particular program requirements applicable to the funding authority or other
relevant provisions of law. For example, some pseudo-FMS cases developed for training, design,
and construction services are subject to particular, additional requirements.

8. Section 1206 programs may include the provision of equipment, supplies, and training. Any
construction must be relatively minor and only as necessary and incidental to installation of critical
components that are provided (e.g., a concrete pad for a coastal radar).

9. The annual selection of programs for approval shall be undertaken as a closely coordinated
process with the DOS; all program proposals shall be jointly formulated and coordinated between
the GCC and the appropriate COM.

10. Currently, section 1206 funds may not be used for support of Iraqi or Afghan security forces.
Section 1206 funds may be used to support coalition members preparing to deploy to Iraq or
Afghanistan for military and stability operations alongside U.S. forces. Section 1206 funds
should not be used for Pakistan, provided the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund and the Pakistan
Counterinsurgency Capability Fund are in effect to meet training and equipment requirements in
Pakistan.

11. Reference (c) shall not be used to backfill or overlap with other authorities, including
lower-priority projects unfunded by FMF, DoD counter-narcotics authorities, cooperative threat
reduction authorities, or other partner capacity-building programs.

12. Section 1206 program planning shall take into account the fiscal and contracting limitations
inherent in the use of expiring DoD annual operation and maintenance (O&M) funds. DoD
7000.14-R (Reference (m)) provides guidance on the use of O&M funds; however, there are some
exceptions applicable to section 1206 that are not covered in existing DoD guidance. For
example, the investment or expense threshold does not apply, and the cross-fiscal year authority
provides an exception to the bona fide needs rule (see paragraph (c) (4) of Reference (c)).

13. Training may begin in the fiscal year in which the program is approved but must be completed
by the end of the following fiscal year. Temporary duty (TDY) expenses may be obligated in
Year One for training that will be provided into Year Two, or for training and TDY expenses
wholly measured in Year Two. The section 1206 program must begin in Year One and end in
Year Two. Civilian salaries may be obligated across fiscal years; civilian personnel are not
required to cease their section 1206-related activities at the end of Year One. If military pay is
part of the reimbursable expense, that, too, may be reimbursed from section 1206 funds.

14. Section 1206 programs shall be subject to these temporary limitations on amounts for building
capacity to participate in or support military and stability operations; not more than $75,000,000
may be used during Fiscal Year 2011, and not more than $100,000,000 may be used during Fiscal
Year 2012.

15. Military Departments will afford section 1206 pseudo FMSLOAs priority handling. With
DOS approval, DSCA will place the pseudo FMS-LOA in an “offered” status. When all
conditions for funding have been met, the Military Departments will then post the accepted status.
DSCA will complete the financial implementation processes in coordination with the Defense
Finance and Accounting Service.
