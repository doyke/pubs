  4.9. Commercial Cellular Services and Devices:
     4.9.1. The Air Force ITCC has established enterprise agreements for the acquisition of
     cellular devices and services from major US providers. This AFI encourages compliance
     with ITCC strategies and use of enterprise agreements for purchase of cellular devices
     and commercial services.
         4.9.1.1. Use commercial cellular services only when it is the most cost-effective way
         to provide necessary communications, or mobility is required.
         4.9.1.2. To take advantage of optimum volume pricing options, the host
         communications unit should use the Air Force enterprise agreements established by
         the ITCC. All service contracts with carriers covered by Air Force enterprise
         agreements shall be executed using the Air Force enterprise agreements.
         4.9.1.3. Consolidated commercial cellular services contracts should include
         provisions that enable decentralized billing to individual units. Using organizations
         are responsible for payment of their commercial cellular bills using unit funds, where
         contractually applicable. Units need to work closely with the local contracting office
         to determine the best procedure. Wings and bases should use centralized payment
         processes upon receipt of written approval from their MAJCOM/CIO or designated
         representative. MAJCOMs may elect to delegate this approval to the local wing
         commander.

        4.9.1.4. Organizations must request host base CSO approval prior to purchasing
        commercial cellular equipment and services. Commercial cellular devices used
        outside the US&P must be host nation approved. Consult your host base spectrum
        manager for guidance.
     4.9.2. The Government-Wide Purchase Card (GPC) is authorized for purchases of
     commercial cellular devices and services. The GPC may be used by contracting officers
     and designated individuals according to the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The card
     may only be used for purchases that are authorized by law or regulation (AFI 64-117, Air
     Force Government-Wide Purchase Card [GPC] Program). Such purchases must be
     made against contracts as outlined in paragraph 4.9.1.
     4.9.3. Cellular telephones have become common place and service costs have decreased.
     As the distinction between how we use CTs and land line telephones blur, it is important
     to be informed of policy and instructions governing the personal use of official cellular
     telephones.
        4.9.3.1. The same rules that govern use of other Air Force communications apply to
        use of Air Force CTs. Like land line telephones, Air Force CTs are to be used for
        official and authorized purposes. “Official” purposes include any calls in furtherance
        of the Air Force mission. In addition, subject to local command and supervisor
        restrictions, members are authorized to use CTs to make short infrequent personal
        calls when appropriate. Some examples of appropriate calls include notifying family
        members of changes in schedules, checking on medical, school, or childcare
        appointments, and inquiring as to car repair status. Emergency calls are always
        authorized. Local commanders may seek reimbursement for additional costs resulting
        from an individual’s personal use of an Air Force CT. Local commanders may also
        regulate personal CT calls depending on local contracts, cost to the government, or
        special circumstances. Such local limitations and cost reimbursement policies will be
        clearly identified to CT users as part of the original issue process.
        4.9.3.2. Members making inappropriate CT calls are subject to disciplinary action
        even if the call does not cause additional expense. Both the UCMJ and Civilian
        Personnel regulations prohibit and provide punishments for inappropriate use of
        government property regardless of cost to the government.
            4.9.3.2.1. Some examples of inappropriate calls include those related to personal
            solicitation or sales matters and those of a harassing or obscene nature. If a caller
            has any questions concerning proper use of government cell phones, it is the
            caller’s responsibility to check with a supervisor before making the call.
            4.9.3.2.2. Do not use Air Force issued CTs to conduct personal commercial
            activities.
        4.9.3.3. The responsible CSO or representative shall review past CT use at the time
        of resolicitation/renewal of contract to ensure selecting the most cost efficient plan
        meeting operational mission needs in accordance with ITCC strategies. The CSO or
        representative must approve requests to increase the monthly expenditure allotment to
        ensure additional expenditures are required to meet mission needs and do not reflect
        an increase caused by unauthorized personal use.
AFI33-106_341MWSUPSUP_I 6 December 2011                                                     15


        4.9.3.4. Government-issued CTs shall not be used while driving on or off base.
        NOTE: Use of cellular devices with or without hands-free accessories may be illegal
        in some jurisdictions.
        4.9.3.5. Local commanders will review current instructions and tailor them as needed
        to allow for local communications requirements or limitations, changing
        technological capabilities of CTs, unique requirements, local contracts, costs, etc.
        Materials provided to CT users should include these locally specific guidelines.
        4.9.3.6. Personal calls to CT service providers from the host base official service may
        be authorized according to AFI 33-111, if the Air Force does not incur a long-
        distance toll or per-call charge. Cellular telephone services that provide per-call
        charges by billing the originating (calling) party, should be limited by the host base
        voice information system to official calls only.
        4.9.3.7. According to AFI 33-111 and CJCSI 6215.01B, health, morale, and welfare
        calls are not authorized on CTs.
     4.9.4. Dual-Number Capable Cellular Telephones (CT).
        4.9.4.1. Local PWCS managers may issue dual-number capable CTs to personnel
        whose official duties require them to be immediately accessible to organizational
        elements such as command posts and operational centers, regardless of the
        individuals proximity to a wireline telephone, on a 24 hour-per-day, 7 day-per-week
        basis.
        4.9.4.2. Issue the CT with only the primary number activated and billable to a
        government account.
        4.9.4.3. Activation of the secondary number capability is at the option of the CTs
        authorized end user.
        4.9.4.4. Activation of a dual-number capability is not permitted on secure CTs.
        4.9.4.5. Local PWCS managers will ensure all personnel issued dual-number capable
        CTs are briefed regarding their personal liability for all costs associated with
        activation and use of the secondary number, and the requirement to establish a
        “personal account” for the secondary number. These costs include, but are not limited
        to: activation fees; monthly recurring charges; long distance, roaming, excess minutes
        and other airtime fees; maintenance and insurance fees; charges/fees resulting from
        misuse of a government-owned instrument; and charges/fees resulting from an
        individual’s failure to cancel the personal account when the CT is no longer
        authorized for use.
        4.9.4.6. Authorized end user of a government-owned, dual-number capable CT:
           4.9.4.6.1. Shall sign an agreement, produced in accordance with Base Judge
           Advocate and Contracting office guidance, which contains appropriate “hold
           harmless” and “personal liability” clauses, prior to being issued a dual-number
           capable CT, without regard to whether or not the user elects to immediately
           activate the secondary number capability.
           4.9.4.6.2. If a secondary number is activated, the user must make sure all bills

            associated with the personal account are mailed directly to the user’s home
            address or post office box.
         4.9.4.7. When a CT is no longer required for the performance of duties, the user shall
         make sure that the personal account is closed and the secondary number zeroized by
         the vendor, prior to returning the CT to the local PWCS manager for reuse.
     4.9.5. Refer to AFI 33-201,Volume 1, and DoDD 8100.2 for guidance on protecting
     classified and sensitive communications. Air Force PWCSs are subject to monitoring.
     4.9.6. For information assurance purposes, use a regular telephone (land line) as a first
     priority when and where available. Even though land lines are more secure than
     commercial cellular devices, all classified communications should be discussed over a
     secure telephone (i.e., secure telephone unit or secure telephone equipment).
  4.10. FRS and ISR Systems:
     4.10.1. The FCC permits the unregulated use of FRS radios within the territorial limits of
     the fifty United States (U.S.), the District of Columbia, and the Caribbean and Pacific
     Insular areas (U.S.). FRS radios may be operated on or over any other area of the world,
     except within the territorial limits of areas where radio-communications are regulated by
     another agency of the U.S. or within the territorial limits of any foreign government.
         4.10.1.1. FRS devices were intended for use by family, friends, and associates to
         communicate among themselves within a small area, or while on group outings. They
         may also be used for military-related (administrative) communications, provided they
         are not used for classified, SBU, command and control, operational, fire/crash,
         security and/or emergency response/medical communications (see Table A2.1). FRS
         units are not designed to make telephone calls. No FCC controlled FRS frequency
         channels can be assigned to any specific individual or organization. The 14
         commercial FRS channels may be used only on a “take turns” basis.
         4.10.1.2. ISR radios are nearly identical to FRS radios. They operate on 14 channels
         that located in the 380-399.9 MHz band (396.875, 397.125, 397.175, 397.375,
         397.425, 397.550, 397.950, 398.050, 399.425, 399.475, 399.725, 399.925 and
         399.975 MHz). Since this band is set aside for use by the DoD, within the US&P,
         make application through your MAJCOM spectrum management office for use of this
         ISR spectrum, prior to equipment acquisition. Obtain host nation approval to use
         these 14 frequencies, if ISR radio operation is outside the US&P. As with its FRS
         counterpart, they may be used for military-related (administrative) communications,
         provided they are not used for classified, SBU, command and control, operational,
         fire/crash, security and/or emergency response/medical communications (see Table
         A2.1).

     remaining legacy tactical radio systems. JTRS is being developed to replace while
     enhancing the capabilities of many legacy handheld, manpack, small form fit,
     airborne, vehicular, maritime and fixed-location radios. As a result, the Air Force and
     other Services are minimizing new radio-based communication programs and
     developing migration strategies for existing ones. Radio acquisition waivers (now
     known as “notifications” while the waiver process is temporarily suspended) are
     required before initiating contracting activity to modify or procure non-JTRS radios
     for programs to meet the intent of the Office of the Secretary of Defense radio
     acquisition policies. The AFC2ISRC is the Air Force lead command for JTRS and is
AFI33-106_341MWSUPSUP_I 6 December 2011                                                      19

                       DETERMINING TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS

A2.1. Overview. As the Base PWCS Manager, one of your most important tasks will be to
determine the technical solution that best satisfies your customer’s communications
requirements. This attachment provides a tool to assist your decision making process. Requiring
units/organizations may also use this tool to assist in preparing requirements documents.
A2.2. Existing Services. PWCS Managers must be aware of the wireless communications
services currently available in local areas to determine an effective technical solution. Sources
for this information include:
   A2.2.1. MAJCOM wireless communications offices (e.g., PWCS manager).
   A2.2.2. Local telephone/cellular/PCS service providers.
   A2.2.3. Electronics stores specializing in communications services/devices.
   A2.2.4. Available DoD and Air Force Enterprise PWCS contracts.
   A2.2.5. Trade and professional publications.
   A2.2.6. AFNetOPS        Architecture   Integrated    Product   team                   (AIPT)
   (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-SC-AF-42).
   A2.2.7. Infostructure Technology Reference Model (i-TRM) (https://itrm.hq.af.mil),
   AFWAY (https://afway.af.mil), and published ITCC product list.
A2.3. Types of Services. Table A2.1 lists examples of the types of wireless services that may
be considered when determining a technical solution.

Table A2.1. Types of Services.
 Type             Functions and Capabilities
 LMR              Conventional: A radio network, composed of handheld and mobile radios,
                  base stations and repeaters, in which each user group is assigned their own
                  operating frequencies.
                  Trunked: A radio network, composed of handheld and mobile radios,
                  control consoles, base stations and repeaters, that relies on computer
                  controlled time sharing of a small number of frequencies to serve a large
                  population of users.
                  ISLMR: Radios designed for operation in hazardous environments,
                  available as conventional or trunked.
 Pagers           Small devices used to deliver short voice or alphanumeric messages to the
                  user. Delivery may be restricted to a local service area, or may be global
                  via satellite. Although messages are usually one-way, two-way services
                  may be available in some areas.
 30                                           AFI33-106_341MWSUPSUP_I 6 December 2011


 Type              Functions and Capabilities
 Cellular          Radio devices that offer telephone-like services through a wireless
 Services          infrastructure. Devices may also offer pager-like (short text message)
                   functions.
 Mobile Satellite Cell phone like devices with the ability to connect with either the terrestrial
 Services         based cell phone/PCS infrastructure, or to a satellite. Existing services also
                  offer a paging only device.
 Wireless Local    Administrative telephone systems where copper phone lines are replaced by
 Loop/Wireless     a wireless RF system (in some cases, copper wires are never installed).
 Office Systems    Similar to a cellular phone system with greatly reduced mobility —
                   generally limited to a campus area or single building/office.
 JTRS              A family of software programmable, multiband/multimode radios that
                   operate from 2 MHz to 2 gigahertz. These radios offer differing levels of
                   service depending on the operating domain (Ground, Fixed, and Airborne).
 FRS Radio         One of the Citizens Band radio services intended for use by members of a
                   family or workgroup to communicate among themselves. Unregulated use
                   of FRS radios within the US&P may replace LMRs for certain
                   administrative communications, but must not be used to transmit classified,
                   SBU, command and control, operational, fire/crash, security or emergency
                   response/medical communications. Use of FRS radios outside the US&P is
                   regulated by the host nation and may not be available for military use in
                   this configuration.
 ISR               ISR radios are of similar construction and operational characteristics as
                   FRS radios. Spectrum authorization must be obtained through MAJCOM
                   Spectrum Managers and the appropriate AFFMA or host nation prior to
                   acquisition and use.

A2.4. Determining a Technical Solution. Answer the questions in Figure A2.1 using the
information contained in your customer’s requirement document. This will help you determine
the technology that may best fill their requirements. After selecting a technology, you may need
to contact local vendors to better define the actual device required. When the selected solution is
available from commercial service providers, refer to the i-TRM and/or Air Force Wireless
Handheld Services and Devices Enterprise Agreements for approved products.
A2.5. Trunked LMR Systems. Before considering a TLMR System, you must be able to
answer “Yes” to the majority of the questions listed below:
   A2.5.1. Are there other federal agencies in the area (within 30 kilometers) that would be
   willing to share a TLMR system with you?
   A2.5.2. Does your base have more than 700 nondeployable users, and/or 35 or more radio
   networks?
   A2.5.3. Are the existing radio networks overcrowded and/or restricted in number, causing
   mission degradation?
AFI33-106_341MWSUPSUP_I 6 December 2011                                                      31


   A2.5.4. Are you able to obtain new frequency authorizations to meet demand for radio
   communications?
   A2.5.5. Is your existing conventional LMR network experiencing increased levels of
   interference due to frequency congestion in the area?
A2.6. Final Considerations. When preparing a technical solution, you must consider the
following:
   A2.6.1. Can the selected device meet security requirements?
   A2.6.2. Will the selected device allow the user to interoperate with the required
   individuals/agencies? (A communication device that doesn’t talk to anyone else is useless, no
   matter how many bells and whistles it has.)
   A2.6.3. Does the selected solution make sense from a business perspective? Does it save the
   Air Force money in the long run? Is it in accordance with the ITCC commodity strategies?
   A2.6.4. Does the selected solution fit into the Base Roadmap (formerly known as the Base
   Blueprint) as developed by the Base Systems Telecommunications Engineering Manager?
   A2.6.5. If you answer “No” to any of these questions, you should reconsider your solution.

                         PLANN1NG FOR PWCS DEPLOYMENT

A6.1. In planning for PWCS deployment, the base CSO and PWCS managers will advise the
wing/base and unit level planners to consider their PWCS requirements well in advance of any
deployment.Other units must plan for deployment anywhere. Some of the factors to consider are:
A6.2. Will you need your handheld telecommunications devices? Can the host base satisfy the
requirement?
A6.3. Are your in-garrison operating frequencies usable in the deployed host area? Coordinate
overseas requirements through MAJCOM and Air Force theater command frequency
management offices.
A6.4. How will you maintain your deployed telecommunications devices?
A6.5. Do you need spares? What is the probability of combat damage or loss in transit or
handling?
A6.6. Will chargers work on host-nation or host-base power sources? (Voltages and frequencies
vary by nation.)
A6.7. Will you need fixed/mobile base stations, repeaters, and antennas? Should you preposition
them, or will you carry and install them yourself?
A6.8. Will you need special procedures and call signs?
A6.9. Will your deployed telecommunications system give you adequate geographical
coverage?
A6.10. Do you need encryption (Advance Encryption Standard (AES), Type 1, etc. )?
A6.11. What about interoperability with other units? (Frequencies, AES, Type 1, etc.)
A6.12. Is your deploying telecommunications device capable of operating within host
base/host nation standards and technical parameters (i.e., frequency, channel spacing, power,
etc.)?
A6.13. Develop a deployed continuity folder by tailoring the information in Attachment 2 to
meet your requirements.The base points of contact now become the deployed points of contact.
