     CONTRACTED SUPPORT ACTIVITY INSPECTION (CSAI) PROCEDURES

A10.1. Any contracts over $150,000 in annual value are subject to functional inspection for both
contracted services and government oversight to ensure contractor compliance with the
Statement of Work (SOW)/PWS. While contracts lower than $150,000 annually are not
typically inspected, they remain subject to inspection at the discretion of the HQ AETC
functional owner and HQ AETC/IG.
A10.2. Each inspected contracted function is rated individually in the functional area that is
responsible for quality assurance and a contractual reference is included with each deficiency.
A10.3. HQ AETC/IG coordinates with HQ AETC/PK and JA on contractual policies and other
matters that affect AETC contracts inspections. For classified contracts, HQ AETC/IG should
also coordinate with AETC/IP for information protection policies.
A10.4. Paragraphs A10.4.1 through A10.4.5.3 outline the required safeguards used by the
inspection team when inspecting contracted activities during inspections to prevent claims and
protests resulting from inspecting contracted functions. HQ AETC/IG inspectors will:
   A10.4.1. Request SOW/PWS and associated government documents from the inspected unit.
   Additional contract-related documents will be obtained from the contracting officer by the
   contracting inspector.
   A10.4.2. Develop contract inspection areas in coordination with HQ AETC functional staff
   agencies.
   A10.4.3. Inbrief the functional commander, write the inspection report inputs, and outbrief
   the functional commander.
   A10.4.4. Consult the cognizant contracting officer when contract interpretation is necessary.
   A10.4.5. For AETC administered contracts, follow these inspection report procedures:
       A10.4.5.1. Contracted activities will be included in inspection reports as a tab in the
       functional area that is responsible for quality assurance of the contracted activities.
       Contracted activities inspections will include these evaluated areas:
       A10.4.5.2. Government Oversight. This area will include all contractor surveillance
       responsibilities, including but not limited to, COR personnel and any associated
       processes and surveillance documents, functional commanders, and interface with
       contracting personnel.
       A10.4.5.3. Contractor Performance/Compliance. This includes an assessment of
       contractor compliance with contract terms and conditions. Deficiencies in this area will
       reference the governing contract. Specific comments regarding contractor performance
       will be included under a separate contractor performance tab in the CSAI report. The
       unit (or responsible organization) contracting office is responsible for addressing
       performance issues with the contractor.
A10.5. For AETC administered contracts, Functional directors and functional commanders must
reply to answerable contractor performance/compliance tab deficiencies in inspection reports.
The respective contracting officer is the OCR and will coordinate on the reply before it is
 10                                            AFI90-201_AETCSUP 28 NOVEMBER 2012


submitted to HQ AETC/IGI. At minimum, replies will address formal government actions taken
by the contracting officer in response to contractor deficiencies. Only contracting officers are
authorized to direct contractors to correct deficiencies identified during inspections.
A10.6. Inspection procedures are:
   A10.6.1. While inspecting, the contracting officer and/or COR personnel will accompany the
   IG during inspections whenever possible. Inspectors will provide feedback to all parties on
   what was found during the inspection.
   A10.6.2. Inspectors will not direct contractor performance, nor will they direct the contractor
   to correct deficiencies. If an inspector notes an imminent danger to personnel or equipment,
   he or she will take immediate action to mitigate the hazard.
   A10.6.3. Contract compliance is validated with the COR and/or the contracting
   officer/administrator.

                           SUPPORT FOR AETC INSPECTIONS

A11.1. Project Officer. Each inspected unit will designate a Project Officer when notified of a
HQ AETC/IG inspection and will forward the name to HQ AETC/IGIX NLT 150-days prior to
the inspection date. This officer will be the coordination focal point with the HQ AETC/IG
Project Officer to ensure all inspection team requirements (transportation, lodging, work areas,
admin, communication support, etc.) are met. The unit Project Officer will identify any
limitations affecting execution of the HQ AETC/IG inspection (identification of facilities/courses
requiring additional security measures, rental car/lodging availability, restricted use of dining
facilities, etc.).
A11.2. Functional Area Requirements (FARs). Requirements are tailored for each inspection.
Compliance with these requirements is mandatory.
   A11.2.1. Wings, Groups, Tenant Units and GSUs. HQ AETC/IGIO will E-mail a list of
   FARs to the unit Project Officer approximately 80 calendar days prior to the inspection. It is
   the responsibility of the unit Project Officer to ensure all functional POCs are aware of all
   requirements.
A11.3. Advanced Echelon (ADVON). For most large-scale inspections, HQ AETC/IGI will
coordinate an ADVON visit approximately 45 calendar days prior to the inspection. The
purpose of the ADVON is to identify infrastructure requirements, perform arrival walkthrough,
and identify locations for Team, Executive, and Observer briefings. Additionally, the unit
should be prepared to provide all of the FAR documents to the HQ AETC IG Project Officer.
ADVON requirements are identified in the FARs.
A11.4. Access to Restricted Areas, Material, and Entry Authorization Lists (EAL):
   A11.4.1. Core AETC IG Team members will be issued a restricted area badge (RAB) by the
   802 SFS, Lackland AFB. AETC IG Team augmentees requiring entry into AETC-owned
   restricted areas for the purpose of inspection will be issued a RAB upon arrival at the
   inspected installation. AF Forms 2586 and validation of investigative requirements will be
   completed on each augmentee by the AETC IG Unit Security Manager and transmitted to the
   Wing IG Project Officer or designated representative (NCOIC Pass and Identification).
   AETC IG Team augmentee RABs will be turned in, accounted fo,r and destroyed prior to the
   departure of the team.
   A11.4.2. Inspectors are authorized access to any material related to the inspection
   commensurate with their security clearances and special access authorization. Upon notice
   of inspection, provide the HQ AETC/IG Project Officer with requirements for access to the
   highest level of classified material used.
   A11.4.3. The IG Security Manager will provide the inspected wing’s IP office with an
   electronic EAL a minimum of three duty days prior to inspection. The electronic EAL will
   be IAW AFI 31-101, Attachement 13. The IG SF team lead will, upon team arrival, provide
   the inspected wing’s SF representative with the authenticated, signed EAL (hard-copy) for
   distribution. The hard-copy EAL will contain the inspectors’ names, ranks, last six of Social
   Security Numbers, or CPID, Badge number (if applicable), and clearance levels. This will
   suffice for entry into all inspectable areas. SFS will ensure the EAL is immediately delivered
 12                                             AFI90-201_AETCSUP 28 NOVEMBER 2012


   to all inspectable wing/group command offices. It is the responsibility of wing leadership to
   ensure proper EAL dissemination to all inspectable areas under their purview. Any clearance
   issues that arise during the inspection will be addressed to the inspected wing’s IP office with
   assistance from the IG SF team lead.
A11.5. Work Center. The inspected unit will establish an IG work center for each inspection
which must be fully functional prior to inspection team arrival. The facility identified will be
dedicated to the IG for the duration of the inspection period as well as the post-inspection,
report-processing period. Details will be worked between the HQ AETC/IG work center
manager/data base manager and the inspected unit work center Project Officer during ADVON
visits and via the FARs posted on the HQ AETC/IG page through the AF Portal.
A11.6. Administrative Personnel Support Requirements:
   A11.6.1. Wings, Groups, and Tenant Units. Wings, groups and tenant units will provide
   administrative/information technology personnel to support the inspection. Requirements and
   skill levels are outlined in the functional area requirements.
   A11.6.2. GSUs. GSUs do not typically provide administrative support. If required, details
   will be provided during pre-inspection coordination.
A11.7. Lodging Requirements:
   A11.7.1. Wings, Groups, and Tenant Units. HQ AETC/IGISL will coordinate the inspection
   team’s lodging requirements. On-base lodging is desired. However, do not displace
   authorized personnel already residing in transient quarters for the sole purpose of
   accommodating team members. The host base will use commercial lodging or establish a
   pre-priced blanket purchase agreement IAW AFI 34-246 for off-base quarters to meet IG
   team needs.
   A11.7.2. GSUs. The inspection team chief will arrange all team lodging requirements.
A11.8. Computer/Communications Requirements:
   A11.8.1. Wings, Groups, and Tenant Units. Because of variances from base to base,
   computer requirements will be provided in the notification-of-inspection package posted on
   the HQ AETC/IG page through the AF Portal 75 calendar days for AD units and 90 calendar
   days for ANG units before the inspection, and will be finalized during the ADVON visit.
   The inspected unit Project Officer should forward these requirements to the supporting
   communications unit in a timely fashion.
   A11.8.2. GSUs. GSUs do not typically provide communication support. If required, details
   will be provided during pre-inspection coordination.
A11.9. Transportation Requirements:
   A11.9.1. Wings, Groups, and Tenant Units. HQ AETC/IGIX will coordinate the number of
   vehicles required with the base transportation officer during the ADVON. The inspected unit
   is responsible for fulfilling transportation requirements. For planning purposes, base support
   plans should include the requirement for approximately one vehicle per two inspectors.
   Vehicles can be sedans, pickups, etc. However, primary emphasis should be on four-door
   vehicles. Units should make maximum use of assigned Government-Owned Vehicle fleet
   supplemented by rental cars to meet IG team requirements.
AFI90-201_AETCSUP 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                             13


   A11.9.2. GSUs. Inspection team chief will arrange all team transportation requirements for
   inspections.
A11.10. Expenses:
   A11.10.1. Wings, Groups, and Tenant Units. Expenses associated with support requirements
   during the inspection (communication support, administrative supplies, etc.) are the inspected
   unit’s responsibility. HQ AETC/IG is responsible for leased/rental vehicle costs starting
   FY13.
   A11.10.2. GSUs. All expenses are the responsibility of the inspecting agency.
A11.11. Inspection Briefings:
   A11.11.1. Arrival Brief:
   A11.11.1.1. Wings, Groups, and Tenant Units. An arrival briefing by the wing will only
   include safety, weather, local threats, and off-limits areas. This is normally accomplished
   prior to IG team training on arrival day and should not exceed 15 minutes.
       A11.11.1.2. GSUs. No arrival brief required.
   A11.11.2. Executive Inbrief:
       A11.11.2.1. Wings, Groups, and Tenant Units. Squadron and group commanders, wing
       staff agency directors, and the commander will normally attend the executive inbrief.
       The unit commander will provide an orientation brief to the inspection team chief and
       key members of the inspection staff. HQ AETC/IGI will follow with an IG executive
       inbrief.
       A11.11.2.2. GSUs. At technical training GSUs, the detachment commander/chief or
       operating location chief will provide an orientation briefing to the inspection team chief.
       The team chief will follow with an IG inbrief.
   A11.11.3. Executive Outbrief:
       A11.11.3.1. Wings, Groups, and Tenant Units. Squadron and group commanders, wing
       staff agency directors, and the commander will normally attend the executive outbrief.
       The outbrief will provide the inspection results and ratings for the various organizational
       elements and functional areas.
       A11.11.3.2. GSUs. The detachment commander/chief or operating location chief and
       appropriate staff will normally attend the outbrief. The outbrief will provide the
       inspection results and ratings for the various organizational elements and functional
       areas.
