INTRODUCTION TO MANAGEMENT OF ITEMS SUBJECT TO REPAIR (MISTR) SYSTEM

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. The Automated Budget Compilation System (ABCS) is used to prepare budget submissions for
   both buy and repair of reparables and consumables managed by the Air Logistics and Sustainment
   Centers (ALCs), Materiel Support Divisions for Depot Level Repair (DLR). It is an online, real-time
   mainframe system that provides on-screen and/or printed reports at any time, which are suitable for
   placement directly into the budget brochures. ABCS resides on the Logistics and Sustainment Man-
   agement Data Bank (LMDB) (D075). ABCS replaced the Repair Requirement Computation System
   (RRCS) (D073) as the command’s tool for MISTR requirement projections.
   1.1.2. The LMDB provides automated support to the Air Force Material Command Directorate of
   Logistics and Sustainment (AFMC/LG) and provides Logistics and Sustainment analysis for the ALC
   processes by researching information management system requirements and developing systems, as
   required for the ALCs and HQ AFMC. It is also providing online, real-time access and response capa-
   bility and providing the capability to perform timely simulations, analyses, and cost studies. It pro-
   vides for a hook-up to the Tinker Data Services (TDSC) AMDAHL mainframe and use of associated
   peripheral devices.
   1.1.3. The ABCS is used to prepare buy and repair budget submissions; however, this instruction will
   only cover the MISTR portion of ABCS-Repair:
       1.1.3.1. ABCS-REPAIR operates on two levels: Item levels (MISTR) and Summary level (Bud-
       get):
           1.1.3.1.1. MISTR (item level). ABCS provides visibility of the repair requirements at item
           level. The Secondary Item Requirement System (SIRS) (D200A) and the Classified Equip-
           ment Requirements Computation (CERC) (D039) repair requirements data can be printed and/
           or interrogated on-screen at any time. At the MISTR level, the Inventory Management Spe-
           cialist (IMS) and Production Management Specialist (PMS) work together to refine the
           D200A/D039 exchangeable requirements. The IMS ensures the requirement quantities are
           correct and adjusts the requirement based on changing scenarios and conditions not addressed
           by the D200A/D039. The PMS ensures the validity of unit repair cost, the quantities of past
           production, and the quantities that have been previously funded but not yet delivered. These
           actions, taken together, ensure that the ALC computes an adequate, valid requirement to
           present to higher headquarters for future funds.
           1.1.3.1.2. Budget (summary level). The budget area of ABCS-Repair provides summary
           reports for budget brochure preparation and directorate requirement tracking. Reports are
           available at a number of levels and report many items of interest. The budget area also gives
           the directorate monitors and the ALC office of primary responsibility (OPR) the file mainte-
           nance capability for weapon system adjustments that are a part of the budget brochure.

       provides for a hook-up to the TDSC AMDAHL mainframe and use of associated peripheral
       devices.
    1.3.2. Execution and Prioritization of Repairs Support System (EXPRESS) (D087X).
       1.3.2.1. The primary function of D087X is repair distribution and prioritization.
AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006                                                                                   5


     1.3.2.2. The functional owner is AFMC/LGY.
     1.3.2.3. System Description: EXPRESS, an automated tool to support pacer lean and the depot
     repair enhancement program (DREP), performs the following functions: prioritization of aircraft
     repairables (PARS); EXPRESS prioritization processor (EPP); and the supportability module.
     EXPRESS provides a single integrated priority list of all repair requirements at an ALC, deter-
     mines the ability of existing resources to support repair actions, and provides the data and the
     mechanism to move items into repair. The source of repair/supply uses a mathematical model in
     PARS to prioritize repair and distribution of assets to the users from the source of the consolidated
     serviceable inventory (CSI). PARS takes into account base flying activity, asset position, and the
     corporately established aircraft availability goals. EPP sets priorities for the repair of items, which
     are not addressed in PARS, and combines all priorities into a single integrated list for each repair
     shop. Assets, which do not have aircraft availability goals, are prioritized using “deepest hole”
     logic to try to fill the most critical need. EPP also provides the prioritized list to the distribution
     module, which identifies prepositioning actions for serviceable parts as they come out of repair.
     The supportability module takes the prioritized repair list from the EPP and determines whether
     the required items can be repaired based on four evaluation criteria: carcass availability; repair
     parts availability; repair funds availability, and repair resources availability. Items that meet all of
     these criteria are entered onto the “Wholesale And Retail Receiving and Shipping” (D035K)
     express table for transfer to the shop.
     1.3.2.4. Feature Description: EXPRESS performs the following functions: Prioritization of Air-
     craft Repairables (PARS); EXPRESS Prioritization Processor (EPP); and the Supportability Mod-
     ule. The source of repair/supply uses a mathematical model in PARS to prioritize repair and
     distribution of assets to the users from the source of the CSI. PARS takes into account base flying
     activity, asset position, and the corporately established aircraft availability goals. EPP sets priori-
     ties for the repair of items that are not addressed in PARS and combines all priorities into a single
     integrated list for each repair shop. Assets that do not have aircraft availability goals are priori-
     tized using a “deepest hole” logic to try to fill the most critical need. EPP also provides the priori-
     tized list to the Distribution Module, which identifies prepositioning actions for serviceable parts
     as they come out of repair. The Supportability Module takes the prioritized repair list from the
     EPP and determines whether the required items can be repaired based on four evaluation criteria:
        1.3.2.4.1. Carcass availability.
        1.3.2.4.2. Repair parts availability.
        1.3.2.4.3. Repair funds availability.
        1.3.2.4.4. Repair resources availability.
        Items that meet all of these criteria are entered onto the D035K EXPRESS Table for transfer to
        the shop.
  1.3.3. Central Secondary Item Stratification (CSIS) (D200N).
     1.3.3.1. The primary function of D200N is Requirements Management.
     1.3.3.2. The functional owner is AFMC/LGY.

       1.3.3.3. System Description: Compare peacetime and war readiness assets against requirements
       for the Air Force recoverable items. Provides printed stratification reports at item level and vari-
       ous summary levels with indication of items subject to buy, repair, termination, and disposal.
       1.3.3.4. Feature Description: The CSIS integration initiative is the chief financial feeder of the
       U.S. Air Force. Being updated to communicate with the Recoverable and Consumable Item Com-
       putation (D200A), the replacement for Recoverable Consumption Item requirements System
       (D041), and to integrate with the seamless supply system Global Command Support System
       (GCSS). It provides online maintenance and interrogations.
       1.3.3.5. Future Description: No significant changes are being made to system functionality per
       Department of Defense (DoD) FMIP.
       1.3.3.6. Technical Description: Processed on mainframe computer with access from terminals at
       ALCs and HQ/AFMC.

       1.3.4.3. System Description: The SIRS maintains visibility on all recoverable and consumable
       spares while computing buy and repair requirements on a quarterly cycle. Examples of recover-
       able items include avionics subsystems, ground communications equipment, and airborne electri-
       cal power generators. Provides indication of items subject to buy, repair, termination, and disposal.
       Provides online maintenance and interrogations. Processed on mainframe (AMDAHL 5995). In
       July 2000 the D200A replaced the D041, D041A, and D062.
       1.3.4.4. Feature Description: Included within this subsystem is the ability to perform online item
       recomputations and batch group recomputations. Approximately 200,000 items are processed by
       this subsystem. Processes performed include maintaining past usage data, forecasting trends and
       applying programs and assets in computing future buy and repair requirements. Two primary
       types of calculations are performed: a Variable Safety Level (VSL) computation and an Aircraft
       Availability Model (AAM) computation, both of which are computationally intensive.
    1.3.5. Equipment Item Process (EIP) (D200C).
       1.3.5.1. The primary function of the D200C is requirements management.
       1.3.5.2. The functional owner is AFMC/DRC.
       1.3.5.3. System Description: EIP provides information on usage factors, repair rates, item man-
       agement computations, base allocations and authorizations, and similar information needed to
       manage the Air Force equipment inventory, such as: vehicles, bolt-meters, fire extinguishers, and
       compressors. Equipment items are usually high-cost, long-life items. EIP provides for both batch
       processing of interfacing files and for the online, real-time access of data by the equipment man-
       agers. The EIP computation and summarization process provides the equipment managers with
       the necessary information to analyze budgetary impacts by organization, location, weapon sys-
       tems and overall total equipment requirements. Users are also provided with simulation capabili-
       ties for budget analysis preparation. Reference DFAS-DE BACC - DMAPS Requirements and
       Implementation Plan.

     1.3.5.4. Future Description: Migrating to Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS)
     (C001) as soon as possible per customer request.
  1.3.6. Maintenance Planning and Execution System (MP&E) (D363).
     1.3.6.1. The primary function of D363 is repair planning. The secondary functions are budget
     execution, budget formulation, depot posture planning, repair distribution & prioritization, and
     requirements management.
     1.3.6.2. The functional owner is HQ AFMC/LGY.
     1.3.6.3. System Description: In June 2000, all of the functionality of the Depot Level Mainte-
     nance Requirements and Program Management System (MRPM) (G072E) migrated to the D363
     The MP&E application provides Repair Program Managers with a standard system for performing
     the actions associated with planning for the maintenance of repairable items. This application pro-
     vides a common system for programming repair requirements, breaking out maintenance work-
     loads among organic, interservice and contract sources of repair (SOR), and providing
     management of the maintenance programs. The MP&E application contributes to improved mate-
     riel management processes by reducing repair cycle requirements and administrative lead-time,
     improving accuracy in determining the total order quantity to be procured and enhancing total
     asset visibility. Additionally, in June 2001, MP&E subsumed the functionality of the System and
     Equipment Maintenance Modification/Maintenance Program (SEMMP) (G079).
     1.3.6.4. Features Description: MP&E provides maintenance program planning, execution and
     management functionality for maintaining major and secondary items. The mission of the pro-
     gram office is to acquire a developer and manage the cost and schedule to oversee the design,
     development, testing, deployment and sustainment of the MP&E system. Also, MP&E houses the
     costs and scheduling data used by the system managers and repair program managers to manage
     maintenance and modification programs that impact the operational capability of workloads, flow
     time, budget estimates, manpower, and facility requirements for aircraft and missiles.
     1.3.6.5. Technical Description: MP&E clients and servers are located on military installations and
     are connected using the base-wide Ethernet LAN. Information is exchanged between the client
     and server via Windows Terminal Server application software. Clients are dispersed throughout
     the confines of the military installation. Servers are located within the local Defense Information
     Systems Agency (DISA) facilities. Database servers run on a HP-UNIX mid-tier platform using
     Oracle 8i Relational Database Management.

NOTES:
         1. On 19 Jun 00, MP&E (D363) subsumed all of the functionality of the G072E and the
            G072E was decommissioned on 31 Oct 00. Currently, AFMCM 20-1, Depot Level Main-
            tenance Requirements and Program Management System (G072E), dated 2 April 1999,
            serves as the mission management regulation and identifies the G072E as the source for
            all depot level maintenance requirements information. AFMCM 20-1 needs to be updated
            or rescinded by a new manual to reflect this change.
         2. On 18 June 01, MP&E (D363) subsumed all the functionality of the G079 and the G079
            was turned off on 30 September 2001. AFMCI 21-124, Systems and Equipment Modifica-
            tion/Maintenance Program (G079), dated 22 August 1996, is the current mission manage-
            ment regulation and provides HQ USAF, HQ AFMC, the DMAG customers, and ALCs

                                                  Chapter 2

                                        SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

2.1. General. MISTR is a management concept of repair whose network of systems is mainly comprised
of D075 ABCS Repair, G019C, and (CAV II). The D075 ABCS REPAIR system within MISTR is a
bridge between the requirements computation and the actual induction/production of an end item. All
exchangeable items (XD1, XD2, and ND2) requiring depot-level repair or overhaul are subject to the pro-
visions of the MISTR concept.

2.2. MISTR Overview:
     2.2.1. Requirement Interface.
        2.2.1.1. The D200C/D200A requirements systems pass to the D075 ABCS REPAIR system, the
        quarterly repair requirements by subgroup master national stock number (NSN), net input and out-
        put (D200C passes output only). Quarterly requirement validation is normally started by the load
        of computed requirements to D075 ABCS REPAIR within the first 10 days of each quarter based
        on quarterly D200C/D200A data as of the end of quarter, three months prior. For example, the
        D075 ABCS REPAIR adjustment quarter started in early October (FY 1st quarter) uses D200C/
        D200A requirements data as of 30 June (prior FY 3rd quarter), and determines the workload for
        the production quarter beginning 1 January (FY 2nd quarter). It is important to recognize this six
        to nine months’ elapsed time between the requirements computation and actual production to
        understand and apply the mechanical and manual process used in the MISTR process (D075
        ABCS REPAIR/G019C/CAV II) to refine, update, and schedule workloads during the adjustment
        and subsequent quarters.
        2.2.1.2. EXPRESS performs the following functions: Prioritization of Aircraft Reparables
        (PARS); EXPRESS Prioritization Processor (EPP) and the Supportability Module.
           2.2.1.2.1. The source of repair/supply uses a mathematical model in PARS to prioritize repair
           and distribution of assets to the users from the source of the CSI. PARS takes into account base
           flying activity, asset position, and the corporately established aircraft availability goals.
           2.2.1.2.2. EPP sets priorities for the repair of items that are not addressed in PARS and com-
           bines all priorities into a single integrated list for each repair shop. Assets that do not have air-
           craft availability goals are prioritized using a “deepest hole” logic to try to fill the most critical
           need. EPP also provides the prioritized list to the Distribution Module, which identifies prepo-
           sitioning actions for serviceable parts as they come out of repair.
           2.2.1.2.3. The Supportability Module takes the prioritized repair list from the EPP and deter-
           mines whether the required items can be repaired based on four evaluation criteria:
               2.2.1.2.3.1. Carcass availability.
               2.2.1.2.3.2. Repair parts availability.
               2.2.1.2.3.3. Repair funds availability.
               2.2.1.2.3.4. Repair resources availability.
AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006                                                                                  11


             Items that meet all of these criteria are entered onto the D035K EXPRESS Table for trans-
             fer to the shop.
  2.2.2. Requirements Update/Adjustment. The IMS and PMS review the requirement and Source of
  Repair (SOR) data. This process is more commonly referred to as “scrub,” or validation action. The
  requirements update and adjustment as applied by the IMS is based primarily on their knowledge of
  the current support status of an item and their assessment of the accuracy of the computation factors
  used by the D200A computation cycle. However, adjustments will not be made based solely on back-
  orders. Adjustments (increase or decrease) should be made based on known or anticipated changes or
  trends in the flying hour program or other factors that differ from the data used in the D200A compu-
  tation cycle. Adjustments must be based on a “what if” computation and documented, and followed
  with appropriate file maintenance actions to adjust the data in later D200A computational cycles. If
  adjustments are made to either the PT+PREP Input or Output, a corresponding quantity change must
  be made to the PT+PREP Input or Output (that is, if the Output is adjusted by a quantity of five, the
  PT+PREP Input must be adjusted by five). The PMS will review the repair quantities per line item,
  and adjust as necessary based on known or anticipated management production problems that will
  inhibit or prohibit induction/production of the planned workload. Adjustments made based on this
  knowledge must be coordinated with the IMS and documented as to reason for the adjustment. After
  the IMS/PMS complete their “scrub” process, the D075 ABCS REPAIR system will mechanically
  recalculate the repair requirement. The D075 ABCS REPAIR B21 is the final mechanized repair
  requirement product and is available after completion of file maintenance.
  2.2.3. Execution. A repair requirement is executed in one of two ways. It can either be negotiated
  (Contract or Organic) or driven through the EXPRESS System (CREP or DREP).
     2.2.3.1. EXPRESS. EXPRESS (D087X) is the daily execution system designed to make critical
     choices in a constrained depot environment. The system looks at customer needs and the repair
     environment daily using current asset and resource information.
     2.2.3.2. Negotiated. For items that do not use EXPRESS, the PMS offers a quarterly requirement
     from the B21 (Actual Repair Requirement line) to maintenance activity.
         2.2.3.2.1. It is necessary to accomplish both pre-negotiation planning and final negotiations
         with the maintenance activity to determine the proper workload mix with total resource avail-
         ability. If the PMS and maintenance shop is aware of production constraints within the negoti-
         ation quarter such as parts shortages, support equipment breakdown, etc. They will negotiate
         the supportable portion of the item’s requirement and advise the IMS of the action taken via
         the Negotiations Requirements Supporting Information screen (AB3007). Unsupportable por-
         tions of the requirement may be moved into subsequent quarter(s). When there is a difference
         between the Total Output Requirements in D075 ABCS Repair and the quantity actually
         negotiated with maintenance, the difference should be coded by inputting a Reason, Sign,
         and Quantity. These three fields are optional entry fields. If any one of these fields is used, then
         all of them must have an entry. Reason code: Negotiation code is entered - only use valid
         G019C Codes - A, B, D, E, F, K, N, O, or R. Sign: “P” or “+” equals Positive and “N” or “-”
         equals Negative will be entered. Quantity: The difference between the two requirements. A
         detailed description of the Beginning Negotiation Codes is located at Attachment 1.
         2.2.3.2.2. All non-EXPRESS items are subject to renegotiations during any MISTR drive
         period as necessary to support customer demands. In addition to changes to requirements
12                                                                AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006


     quantities that occur as a result of actual quarterly negotiations, there is a need to be able to
     respond to changes requested after those negotiations have been completed. These changes are
     normally initiated by the Product Directorate customer in response to ever-changing weapons
     system support needs or shortfalls of other anticipated support sources. It is possible, however,
     especially near the end of a fiscal year, that Workloading personnel or Production schedulers
     will need to initiate requests for changing established requirements to balance remaining
     workloads and resources or adjust obligated funds. Any renegotiations that occur after the
     beginning of the quarter must be accomplished by input through the MWMS (G004L) by
     updating the Workload Requirements Record (804). The negotiation codes on Attachment 1
     are also applicable to the 804 Renegotiation/Drive Adjustment Screen

                            MISTR ITEM MANAGEMENT (IMS/PMS)

3.1. Introduction.
   3.1.1. General. This chapter gives policies and procedures to be used by the IMS and PMS in pro-
   cessing intermediate range MISTR repair requirements. Repair procedures included in this chapter
   apply to both exchangeable and replacement type items with Expendability, Recoverability, Repara-
   bility Category (ERRC) codes “T,” “C,” and “S” scheduled for depot-level repair.
   3.1.2. Unprogrammed Requirements. Repair Group Category (RGC) “J” items are repaired
   through the MISTR System. However, special purpose repair requirements for “T,” “C,” and “S”
   ERRC coded items, such as inspection, reclamation, special projects, analytical overhaul, and tear-
   down deficiency reports (TDRs) will be processed to the SOR as an unprogrammed requirement on a
   AFMC 206, Temporary Work Request or as a Project Directive (PD). These provisions include an
   online, interactive capability to establish new MISTR workload requirements and file maintain exist-
   ing workload files that will enhance G019C processes. It applies to personnel in the Product Director-
   ates that are involved in processing temporary work requests and managing temporary workloads.
   Repair requirements for items requiring field level repair at the depot are also processed to the repair
   facility through an AFMC 206. A PD is prepared to reflect maintenance projects for Program Depot
   Maintenance, modification, check and test, return serviceability, maintenance, prototypes, analytical
   equipment overhaul, and maintenance/reclamation of Air Force equipment and parts. The PD is pre-
   pared by the buyer PMS and informs the DMAG work loader of the type of work to be accomplished,
   an input/output schedule, and quantities by FY quarter.
NOTE: The initiator of the AFMC 206 actions is responsible for correctly assigning/updating the priority
and, when applicable, downgrading the priority or canceling the AFMC 206 if the requirement no longer
exists.

3.2. Repair Projection Products:
   3.2.1. Description of ABCS-Repair (AD075 ABCS Repair. - B21).
       3.2.1.1. The entire range of repair requirements as reflected in the D200A/D200C systems will be
       displayed on ABCS-REPAIR Quarterly Projection Worksheets. These products can be pulled by
       the IMS/PMS for review, adjustment, documentation, and approval of the repair requirement. The
       method for computing D200C requirements is contained in AFMCMAN 23-4, Computation of
       Requirements for Equipment Items and the method for computing D200A requirements is con-
       tained in AFMCMAN 23-1, Requirements for Secondary Items (D200A, D200N). Detailed
       instructions for using ABCS REPAIR are found in the ABCS Users Manual provided by the ALC/
       LG/MATERIEL SUPPORT GROUP Repair OPR.
       3.2.1.2. The B21 is divided into the following sections:
           3.2.1.2.1. Basic Data.
           3.2.1.2.2. Subgroup Repair Requirements.
           3.2.1.2.3. Actual Repair Requirements.

            3.2.1.2.9. Fiscal Year Quantities and Dollar Value.
            3.2.1.2.10. Weighted Unit Sales Prices and Signature.
        3.2.1.3. A B21 is available if there is a repair requirement or a SOR record. If the item has not
        been negotiated (no hours, no unit sales price, or the last two positions of the PMS are blank), an
        801 record must be prepared to establish the item in the SOR MISTR Master File, if organic.
        3.2.1.4. The quarterly D075 ABCS REPAIR.-B21 will display projected repair requirements for
        six years (two years by quarters and four years by fiscal year).
        3.2.1.5. The IMS is responsible for validating and file maintaining the D200A/D039 PT+PREP
        lines. The PMS is responsible for validating and file maintaining the SOR data, (unit sales price,
        SOR percent, actual inductions, and production) which will be reflected on the Family Adjusted
        Requirement. The PMS will inform the IMS of the change. Detailed file maintenance instructions
        are found in the ABCS REPAIR User’s Manual. Adherence to the Manual is mandatory.
        3.2.1.6. Upon completion of the file maintenance, a final ABCS REPAIR Quarterly Projection
        Worksheet. B21 should be pulled and appropriate signatures obtained. The IMS/MM is required to
        sign all B21s regardless of whether the item is driven by EXPRESS or negotiated. If the item has
        organic repair, the PMS buyer is required to sign the B21. If the item has Contract repair, the PMS
        seller is required to sign the B21. The ES signature is required if there are changes in rates and fac-
        tors. This retention copy of the B21 will reflect the negotiated quantities (if non-EXPRESS item)
        and all signatures. The D075 ABCS REPAIR.-B21 will be retained for two years.
        3.2.1.7. The Family Adjusted input requirement by actual stock number will be passed to the
        D363 MP&E System.
     3.2.2. Basic Data Description:
        3.2.2.1. The following descriptive is the basic data narrative, source data and processing instruc-
        tions for each of the data elements contained in the D075 ABCS REPAIR System:
        A-D075-ABCS-REP-P-B21 product are as follows:
            3.2.2.1.1. Cycle: This is the asset as of cut-off date of the requirements repair cycle:

            was derived for use in the ABCS.
            3.2.2.1.3. ALC: The two-digit code of the ALC, which has been assigned IM responsibility
            for the item. The Source of Supply (SOS) ALC code managing the item.
AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006                                                                            15


       3.2.2.1.4. SGM: Subgroup Master Stock Number for the bachelor item or for the family
       group.
       3.2.2.1.5. IMS: Item Management Specialist/Material Manager responsible for the item.
       Include MM - Material Manager who is IMS and PMS together.
       3.2.2.1.6. Buy PMS: Buyer Production Management Specialist/Material Manager Code
       responsible for the item(s). The PMS/MM receives the repair requirement from the IMS and
       negotiates repair with the workload specialist or passes the requirement to the Seller PMS for
       contract repair.
       3.2.2.1.7. Sell PMS: Seller Production Manager Code responsible for the item(s). Identifies
       the PMS who is assigned when the item is being repaired by another service or civilian con-
       tract facility.
       3.2.2.1.8. Noun: Nomenclature describing the item(s).
       3.2.2.1.9. I&S Master: Interchangeability and Substitutability Subgroup Stock number identi-
       fied as the master item for the subgroup Master Stock Number for the bachelor item or the
       family group.
       3.2.2.1.10. OOU: Order of Use code is received from the D035A
       3.2.2.1.11. DMC - Differential Management Code: A one-digit code denoting the manage-
       ment category of the item. There are two DMCs:
          3.2.2.1.11.1. High activity - DMC “P” - Predictable: Items consume about 80 percent of
          AFMC’s repair resources. The Item Activity Code (IAC) received from the D200A System
          will identify the level of activity of items (AFMCMAN 23-1, Chapter 21, Requirements
          for Secondary Items (D200A, D200N)). This will be mechanically determined by the D075
          ABCS REPAIR system by recognizing IAC numbers 5 through 8 as high activity. Num-
          bers 1 through 4 will be considered as low activity.
          3.2.2.1.11.2. Low activity DMC “C” - Unpredictable: IAC numbers 1 through 4 will be
          considered as low activity. For D200C items, the DMC is manually file maintained into the
          D075 ABCS Repair System, using the same criteria as the D200A. About 20 percent of the
          items in MISTR fall into the high activity category. Low activity items consume about 20
          percent of the repair resources. About 80 percent of all MISTR items fall into this category.
          3.2.2.1.11.3. The DMC is assigned mechanically for D200N items based upon the D200A
          Item Activity Code.
       3.2.2.1.12. MIEC: Mission Item Essentiality Code is a three-digit alphanumeric code. For
       D200A items, this code is mechanically passed to the D075 ABCS REPAIR System. For
       D200C items, the IMS must manually file maintain this code into the D075 ABCS REPAIR
       System. The Equipment Specialist must assist the IMS in determining the proper code. See
       Attachment 4 for a listing of the MIEC codes.
       3.2.2.1.13. MIEC NR: Mission Essentiality Code sequence number. The D075 ABCS
       REPAIR system will mechanically convert the three-digit MIEC to a corresponding two-digit
       sequence code (MIEC). The two-digit MIEC Number code will appear on all output products,
       which display the MIEC. See the matrix converting MIEC(s) to MIEC sequence number at
       Attachment 5 (MIEC Matrix).

      group Master family is displayed by quarter for two FYs and by FY for six FYs. Input and output
      define the requirement. There are four increments reflected:
          3.2.2.2.1. D200A/D200C.
          3.2.2.2.2. PT+PREP Input And Output - This represents the peacetime plus preposition
          MISTR de-accumulated input and output lines directly from the comps or D200A initiated by
          the cut-off date.
NOTE: D200C repair requirements must be computed and file maintained by the IMS/MMS.
          3.2.2.2.3. Family Stratified Repair Input And Output - This is the above requirement after any
          coded scrub has been file maintained by the Item Manager, examples: FMS “H” coded backo-
          rders, YBQ Backorders, etc. The quarterly repair requirement computed by D200A and
          D200C. Quantities displayed are for negotiation targets for both Input and Output repair
          needed to support peacetime (POS) and prepositioned (MRSP/IRSP) requirements.
          3.2.2.2.4. Family Adjusted Requirement Input And Output - This is the final repair require-
          ment after all ABCS adjustments, prior quarters’ actual inductions/productions, current quar-
          ter negotiations, prior quarter/prior year funded undelivered quantities have reduced the
          requirement. It provides actual data that can alter or update repair requirements appearing in
          the Family Stratified lines as overlaid from D200A/D200C. This information states what actu-
          ally happened in the “first” quarter shown on the D075 ABCS REPAIR-X21; what is negoti-
          ated to happen during the “second” quarter; and what should happen in the “third” quarter and
          the five quarters that follow as they are tempered by actual repair data. The procedure used to
          update the family repair elements can be either manual or mechanical.
      3.2.2.3. Actual Repair Requirements. This section contains the total scrubbed repair requirement
      for the family. The requirement is portrayed by actual stock number, SOR, production number,
      contract line item number (CLIN), Exclusion (ICS/RIW/AFIC), directed program (DP), and
      non-programmed 206 NP Items. Also included in this part of the B21 are mod items and other
      NSNs, family members within this subgroup that are generating reparables; however a SOR, prod
      number or CLIN has not been assigned. Contracts that start with L24 are created by the system for
      items in CAV II that have a customer order quantity (COQ) that have not yet been awarded a con-
      tract.
          3.2.2.3.1. The actual stock number is the individual NSN within the family group for which a
          repair requirement has been computed.

          within the family subgroup. The five-digit control number and one-digit job designator
          assigned to the actual stock number by the SOR in accordance with G019C. The job designa-
          tor indicates the level of repair being performed by the SOR.
      3.2.2.4. Reparable_Generation (REP-GEN) History. This portrays the reparable generation his-
      tory, by actual stock number, and that NSN’s percent of generations from the D200N for the past
18                                                                   AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006


     12 months. The information contained here may be used for validating supportability of the repair
     requirement. This element reflects the total quantity of base not reparable this station (NRTS) and
     Depot Rep-Gens minus Job Routed Condemnations during the past 12-month period. The percent
     element represents the percentages of reparable generations attributed to the actual stock number
     as compared to the total reparable generations for the family group.

           3.2.2.10.1. WTD USP by Year. A Source Record Code (SRC) beside each WTD USP indi-
           cates how the WTD USP was computed. If an item has repair quantities in the FY, then the
           WTD USP = (total Repair $ for the FY) divided by (total repair quantities for the FY) and the
           SRC is “Q.” If the repair quantities are zero, but there are SOR records, then the WTD USP
           equals the sum of (each SOR USP times its SOR percent) and the SRC is “P.” If there are no
           SOR records for the item, then the WTD USP defaults to the D200A/D200C WTD USP and
           the SRC is “D.” The SRCS for all items will be “D” until the SOR data is loaded.
           3.2.2.10.2. Signatures:
     3.2.3. Responsibilities of ABCS-REPAIR Requirement Review and Validation.
        3.2.3.1. At the MISTR level, the IMS, MMS, and PMS work together to validate the D200A/
        D200C exchangeable requirement to determine funding required to support the Air Force mission.
        The IMS/MMS ensures the requirement quantities are correct and adjusts the requirement based
        on changing scenarios and conditions not addressed by D200A/D200C. The PMS is responsible
        for the SOR data.
        3.2.3.2. The budget area of ABCS-Repair provides summary reports for budget brochure prepara-
        tion and PD requirement tracking. Reports are available at a number of levels and report many
        items of interest. The budget area also gives the ALC OPR and the PD monitor file maintenance
        capability for weapon system adjustments that are a part of the budget brochure.
     3.2.4. IMS/MM Responsibilities :
        3.2.4.1. The following actions will be accomplished by the IMS/MM for each Material Support
        Division (MSD) Repair Cycle or as directed by LG immediately after the ABCS is opened for file
        maintenance. This generally occurs a few days after the final CSIS (D200N) re-summary.
           3.2.4.1.1. The “MMERROR LIST” by IMS code. This product is available as online view or
           print. Items on this list and the PMS ERROR List have repair requirements in ABCS-REP but
           there are critical errors associated with the item such as unknown or Default SOR, Invalid
           PCN, Invalid USP. The PMS/MMS must take action to input a SOR record in the ABCS - REP
           and correct all identified errors. This listing will be used to ensure all items, even if the PMS
           code is blank, are worked by the PMS/MMS. The PMS can generate an error list by PMS
           code; however, items where the PMS code is blank or wrong will not appear on individual
           PMS Error List and will not be identified for corrective action.
           3.2.4.1.2. The IMS PT + PREP Index by QTR. This product is required by the IMS/MM to
           review data and file maintain any changes. Documentation as to the reason for the adjustment
           in requirements must be annotated on the D200NRequirements Computation. Any changes to
           the PT + PREP requires a reason code (see appendix XXXXX for reason codes). If the adjust-
AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006                                                                                23


        ment applies to more than one reason code, the reason code that relates to the greatest change
        (either increase or decrease) in repair requirement dollars, will be selected as the predominant
        reason code, and will be used for all quarters being adjusted.
        3.2.4.1.3. Validate Repair Requirement reflected on the B21 or PT + PREP Index “D200A/
        D200C PT+PREP IN and OT” line. NOTE: This is the scrubbed PT+PREP MISTR INPUT/
        OT DEACCUMULATED Requirement. DO NOT INCLUDE PRESTOCKED REQUIRE-
        MENT.
            3.2.4.1.3.1. Review the final D200N computation for any error data elements such as
            pipeline days, assets, additives, factors, rates, applications, etc. Initiate a D200A “What-If”
            for any errors identified and input changes to ABCS, as necessary. The D200C IMS/MMS
            must compute the repair requirements.
            3.2.4.1.3.2. All items with repair requirements must be reviewed to ensure carcass sup-
            portability.
               3.2.4.1.3.2.1. Any requirements included in the budget must have reparable assets
               on-hand or expected to generate to ensure all MSD dollars allocated can be obligated.
               3.2.4.1.3.2.2. Suspect items that may not be reparable supportable are items with esti-
               mated rates or declining usage program.
               3.2.4.1.3.2.3. Data from the A-D075.ABCS-REP-P-B21 product or other online data
               can assist the IMS/MMS in determining carcass supportability. Refer to the ABCS
               Repair Users Guide for instructions. If non-supportable, review D200N and Factors/
               Program to determine reason for non-supportability. Contact ES to assist in the review
               of Factors/Program.
            3.2.4.1.3.3. ABCS is to be updated for D200N changes accomplished after Final CSIS
            Re-stratification and for all D200C items with projected repair requirements.
               3.2.4.1.3.3.1. Repair requirement must be updated in ABCS-REP. Any Data that is
               found in error must be file maintained in ABCS-REP. Documentation must be main-
               tained to support all changes.
               3.2.4.1.3.3.2. Changes should be file maintained on the “SCRUB IN DAC” and
               “SCRUB OT DAC” lines for all quarters/years requiring a change.
            3.2.4.1.3.4. ICS items that have transitioned with undelivered assets from the ICS contract
            require special update to compensate for undelivered assets. Requirement must be reduced
            by undelivered ICS contract assets to prevent budget overstatement. To account for the
            assets from the ICS contract, reduce the SCRUB IN DAC by the amount due in from ICS
            repair and use Reason Code (RC) 24.
            3.2.4.1.3.5. FMS “H” Coded Backorders received after the D200A cut-off and are not
            already in the computation should be file maintained into ABCS Repair.
            3.2.4.1.3.6. Adjustment additives not included in the D200A summary should be file
            maintained into the ABCS Repair such as “YBQ” backorders received after the cut-off
            date up to the available reparables in the D200A.
     3.2.4.2. Review and Validate Data. The following data elements will be reviewed and validated:
24                                                                    AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006


           3.2.4.2.1. Review and Validate I&S Groupings. Identify any erroneous I&S groupings to the
           ALC Repair OPR for file maintenance action.
               3.2.4.2.1.1. Validate the “EXCL” Code and “ICS Date.”
                  3.2.4.2.1.1.1. EXCL code “C” ensures that requirements repaired under ICS are
                  removed from the MSD Budget up to the transition date.
                  3.2.4.2.1.1.2. Validation of the ICS Date must represent the actual transition date
                  regardless of the date that passed from the D200A. Last digit must be 03, 06, 09, or 12.
                  3.2.4.2.1.1.3. Reliability Improvement Warranty (RIW) Items coded “W.” The IMS/
                  MMS accomplishes normal scrub of requirements. In conjunction with the PMS, deter-
                  mine the percentage of repair that will be covered by warranty. PMS/MMS must file
                  maintain the source of repair percents by quarter prorating to warranty and/or MSD
                  Budget to remove any projected warranty repair.
                  3.2.4.2.1.1.4. EXCL code “X” is for the items managed at the Artificial Intelligence
                  Agency, San Antonio, Texas.
                  3.2.4.2.1.1.5. EXCL code “F” allows you to file maintain the actual percentage
                  requirement that is ICS.
               3.2.4.2.1.2. Agile Logistics and Sustainment “LL” Code. Assignment of “LL” code will
               cause the following:
                  3.2.4.2.1.2.1. “D” “LL” Code will cause ABCS to use the scrubbed requirement (the
                  current Qtr requirement from the Family Stratified Repair line) as the current quarter
                  negotiated in/out. This impacts the over/under induction calculations.
                  3.2.4.2.1.2.2. Assignment of Codes
                  3.2.4.2.1.2.3. Blank “LL” Code should be used if negotiated and negotiated quantities
                  appear in G019C.
                  3.2.4.2.1.2.4. If an item is an EXPRESS item and has a zero negotiated quantity in
                  G019C you must use the “LL” code “D.”
                  3.2.4.2.1.2.5. Dual Repair. Should reflect “D.”
                  3.2.4.2.1.2.6. Organic and Contract. Should reflect LL “D.”
                  3.2.4.2.1.2.7. Organic and Other ALC Organic. If another ALC is predominate and
                  requirements are not negotiated for repair, LL is “D.”
                  3.2.4.2.1.2.8. Contract Repair Only is “D” if CREP and blank if not CREP.
                  3.2.4.2.1.2.9. IMS Code, Budget Program (BP), System Management Code (SMC),
                  Forecast Unit Price (FUP), ALC Code, Date of Last Procurement (DOLP), Shop Flow
                  Days (SFD), Depot Condemnation Percent.
     3.2.5. PMS/MM Responsibilities:
        3.2.5.1. Generally, the buyer PMS/MMS and the seller PMS act as a liaison between the item
        management and the maintenance activities. The following actions will be accomplished by the
        PMS/MM for each MSD Repair Cycle or as directed by LG immediately after the ABCS SOR
AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006                                                                              25


     data is loaded. The load occurs when ABCS Repair receives the CAV II interface, which generally
     is scheduled between the 13th and 15th day of the current quarter:
     3.2.5.2. The “PMS Error List.” This product is available as online view or print. Items on this list
     have repair requirements in ABCS-REP but there are critical errors associated with the item such
     as unknown or default SOR, invalid PCN, invalid USP. The PMS/MMS must take action to input
     a SOR record in the ABCS-REP and correct all identified errors.
        3.2.5.2.1. The Buyer PMS/Seller PMS Repair Index. This product is required by the PMS/
        MM to review data and file maintain any changes. The PMS/MMS ensures the validity of the
        following elements in D075 ABCS REPAIR:
            3.2.5.2.1.1. Unit Sales Price (USP)/Unit Repair Costs (URC). The URC/USP is important
            because it is the basis for the budget statement. The MSD repair is forecast in repair dol-
            lars. The accuracy of the URC/USP determines the accuracy of the requirement as stated in
            the budget which in turn directly affects the obligation authority allowed in the out years.
            If the URC/USP exceeds 75 percent of the Forecast Unit Price (FUP), the IM/MM must be
            notified for appropriate action to be taken.
            3.2.5.2.1.2. Actual Induction for any past quarter must be verified.
            3.2.5.2.1.3. Quantities of past production.
            3.2.5.2.1.4. Quantities which have been funded previously but not yet delivered.
            3.2.5.2.1.5. SOR percentage. Ensure the SOR percent for each quarter is valid. The SOR
            percent should be against the contract number CLIN that will produce the future require-
            ment.
            3.2.5.2.1.6. PMS Code.
            3.2.5.2.1.7. SIQ and COQ.
            3.2.5.2.1.8. Program Control Number. Corrects ABCS-REP items identified on the MM
            and/or PMS Error List as invalid PCN. If no PCN is assigned, the PMS must obtain a valid
            pseudo-code from MP&E. Items having four or more stable repair requirements per year
            will be considered programmed repair requirements. Accordingly, permanent PCNs will
            be established for these items. ALCs will retain the prerogative to define programmed
            repair requirements at less than four stable repair requirements per year. For a breakdown
            or the PCN structure by column, Attachment 2. An alternate option to the above is to use
            the already-established PCN for similar workload, either programmed or unprogrammed.
            If the item in question will be unprogrammed and the MM/PMS has an established PCN,
            which will eventually be used to fund the repair, that PCN should be file-maintained. If the
            item will be programmed, the MISTR PCN already established for similar workload
            should be used. This will avoid the “invalid PCN” error messages from generating.
            3.2.5.2.1.9. Standard Direct Product Hours (SDPH).
            3.2.5.2.1.10. End Item Direct Product Standard Hours (EIDPSH).
            3.2.5.2.1.11. Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC).
            3.2.5.2.1.12. Contractor on-hand assets.
            3.2.5.2.1.13. Production Numbers.
26                                                                   AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006


             3.2.5.2.1.14. Determines Under Induction Reason Codes.
         3.2.5.2.2. Specific Buyer PMS Duties:
             3.2.5.2.2.1. Determines and file maintains appropriate SOR Codes(s).
             3.2.5.2.2.2. File maintains PMS codes, as necessary.
             3.2.5.2.2.3. Establishes organic SOR records in ABCS-REP for those organic items lack-
             ing records in G019C.
             3.2.5.2.2.4. Reviews and ensures accuracy of organic execution data on the
             D075.ABCS-REPAIR-B21.
             3.2.5.2.2.5. SOR percentages. The Buyer/MMS file maintains the contract/organic split
             and the split among organic actual NSNs. Ensures the SOR percent for each quarter is
             valid. The SOR percent should be assigned to the production number that will produce the
             future requirement. File Maintains the SOR percent by quarter, prorating to warranty
             (RIW) and/or MSD repair. Ensure percentage and quarters excluded for ICS are valid.
             Assures accuracy of SOR percents and file maintains as necessary. Sum of SOR percents
             must equal 100 percent.
             3.2.5.2.2.6. Unit Repair Cost (URC) - This is the price that the SMAG pays the DMAG to
             repair the item. This field comes from G019C and in the G019C products this field is
             labeled “Repair Cost.” The Repair Cost for each quarter may be different; however, nor-
             mally the repair cost is constant throughout the year. The URC must be validated for each
             production number having a SOR percent and any production number having an actual
             input value.
             3.2.5.2.2.7. Actual Induction. Ensure actual inductions are correct by Production Number.
             3.2.5.2.2.8. The asset data must be verified to ensure the requirement is supportable.
             3.2.5.2.2.9. File maintenance must be taken in ABCS-REPAIR to correct any data found
             to be in error.
NOTE: All changes must be documented on the G019C products.
             3.2.5.2.2.10. Determine the appropriate code for the under inducted requirements after the
             initial file maintenance cut-off. This will be accomplished on the March and September
             D200N computations. The Under Induction report will also serve as a backlog report to
             HQ Air Force. The code will be file maintained in ABCS-REPAIR.
         3.2.5.2.3. Specific Seller PMS Duties:
             3.2.5.2.3.1. Establishes contract SOR records in ABCS-REPAIR for those contract items
             lacking records in CAV II.
             3.2.5.2.3.2. Establish correct SOR percentage for contract items based on the contracts
             and CLINs that will produce the future requirements ABCS-REPAIR computes default
             percentages based on past production. In most cases, these default SOR percentages need
             to be adjusted. If, for example, some past production came from an expiring contract/
             CLIN, the ABCS-REP (MISTR) system will assign a SOR percent to the contract/CLIN.
             The system also uses the associated USP to value that portion of the future requirement.
             Since future production will most certainly use a more current USP, the SOR percent on
AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006                                                                                 27


             the expiring contract /CLIN should be reduced to zero and a more current contract percent
             increased.
             3.2.5.2.3.3. Reviews and ensures accuracy of the contract execution data from the
             A-D075.ABCS-Repair.
             3.2.5.2.3.4. SOR percent. Ensure the SOR percent for each quarter is valid. The SOR per-
             cent should be against the Contract number CLIN that will produce the future requirement.
             3.2.5.2.3.5. Unit Sales Price (USP). This is the price the SMAG pays the DMAG to repair
             the item. This field comes from CAV II and in the CAV II products this field is labeled
             “Unit Sales Price.” The USP must include the contract costs (labor), the necessary rate to
             recover administrative costs [direct cite funding is replacing the industrial fund](other), the
             cost of GFM (if applicable). The USP must be adjusted for fees that are recorded as a sep-
             arate line item in CAV II, such as management fee. The USP for any CLIN having a SOR
             percent must be validated for accuracy. In addition, the seller PMS must assure accuracy of
             the USP for all Contract/CLIN with actual input for past quarters plus the contract/CLIN
             assigned a future SOR percent. The seller PMS is required to maintain documentation to
             support the accuracy of the USP.
             3.2.5.2.3.6. Actual inductions for any past quarter must be verified.
             3.2.5.2.3.7. Prior Funded Unproduced by Contract/CLIN must be verified.
             3.2.5.2.3.8. The asset data will be verified to ensure the requirement is supportable.
             3.2.5.2.3.9. File maintenance must be taken in ABCS-REP to correct any data found to be
             in error.
NOTE: All changes must be documented on the CAV II products.
             3.2.5.2.3.10. In coordination with the buyer, determines the reasons for under inductions.
             3.2.5.2.3.11. Customer order quantity.
   3.2.6. Processing of ABCS-REPAIR Quarterly Projection Worksheets (AD075 ABCS Repair
   -B21).
      3.2.6.1. The IMS will have approximately 10 days to review the projected repair requirements
      before forwarding the product to the PMS. The D075 ABCS REPAIR system performs a mechan-
      ical update to the Family Repair Update portion of the A-D075 ABCS REPAIR-B21 for both
      Input and Output based on induction/production, and current quarter negotiations from the G019C
      system for non Lean Logistics and Sustainment items. The system also updates contract induction/
      production from the CAV II system. The mechanical update within the D075 ABCS REPAIR sys-
      tem subtracts the sum of the first two quarters of data in the Family Adjusted Requirement, from
      the sum of the first three quarters of data in the Family Stratified Repair. The result becomes the
      quantity displayed in the third data field of the Family Repair Update for negotiation purposes. If
      the result is negative, the third data field will be zero, and the negative quantity will be deducted
      from the subsequent quarter's data fields. This applies to both Input and Output.
      3.2.6.2. When it becomes necessary to manually adjust the D200A/D200C repair requirements,
      the following procedures are used:
28                                                                AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006


     3.2.6.2.1. Any adjustments made to the D200A computed repair requirement require manual
     update to the D075 ABCS REPAIR.-B21 Family Stratified Repair and the Family Adjusted
     Requirement. If an adjustment is made to the Family Stratified Repair output, the quantity
     changed for output must also be changed for net input (either plus or minus) in an equal
     amount. Any change to these requirements must be documented by the applicable reason code
     established for the change. In addition, the Family Adjusted Requirement must be recomputed
     in the same manner as the D075 ABCS REPAIR mechanical update procedures for both output
     and input.
     3.2.6.2.2. For D200C organic items, any adjustments to the Family Stratification will be made
     in the same manner as the D200A computed repair requirements. The third update quarter (Net
     Input /Output) of the Family Repair Update must be manually computed in the same manner
     as mechanically computed for D200A items. The net input for the first quarter of the “Family
     Adjusted Requirement” data should be actual net inductions (or gross inductions less condem-
     nations). The second quarter net input data must be the actual net negotiation quantity as stated
     in the A-G019C-C26-C2MJO report or as amended by AFMC Form 804, Renegotiation and
     Drive Adjustment Record GO19C . For output data, the first quarter must be the past quar-
     ter’s actual production. The second output quarter (current processing quarter) must be the
     current output negotiated quantity.
     3.2.6.2.3. For Contract, RIW and ICS items, any adjustment made to the Family Stratified
     Repair will be the same procedure as D200A computed requirements. The Family Adjusted
     Requirement must be manually computed. The following instructions apply:
        3.2.6.2.3.1. The first update quarter of net input will be the total quantity placed on con-
        tract/funded purchase requests (PRs)/ (without regard to the FY funding) that was undeliv-
        ered as of the asset cut-off date (recommended source D363 [MP&E],), plus any quantity
        placed on contract funded PRs during the first update period.
        3.2.6.2.3.2. The second update quarter of net input will be that quantity placed or antici-
        pated to be placed on contract during the second update period.
        3.2.6.2.3.3. The first update quarter of output will be that quantity that was actually pro-
        duced during the first update quarter. (Example: if first update quarter is April, May, June,
        use the quantity actually produced during this quarter. In the event that the June data are
        not available, use the next month forecast data from the May contractor production report
        or CAV II (formerly G009) input. This will be production regardless of FY funds.
        3.2.6.2.3.4. The second update quarter for output will be that quantity anticipated or
        expected to be produced during the second update period, regardless of when the assets
        were input. During the 31 March computation (AD075 ABCS REPAIR.-B21 produced in
        July), the AD075 ABCS REPAIR.-B21 will be manually coded for over/under budget/
        induction to align funding in appropriate fiscal year. This adjustment is made in ABCS
        Repair that will be used by each ALC in preparing of the Family Adjusted Requirement
        and does not affect the quarterly amounts reflected on the A-D075 ABCS REPAIR -B21.
        After the net input in the Family Stratified Repair Requirement and the net input of the
        Family Repair Update have been validated, the over/under budget induction adjustment
        will be determined in the following sequence:
AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006                                                                               29


                3.2.6.2.3.4.1. Determine the Apportionment Year (AY) requirement by adding the
                quantities in the third and fourth quarters of the current FY Net Input in the Family
                Stratified Repair.
                3.2.6.2.3.4.2. Determine the negotiated quantity in the AY by adding the third quarter
                inductions and the fourth quarter current negotiated net input (first and second print
                position of the Family Adjusted Requirement).
                3.2.6.2.3.4.3. If the result of (2) above (negotiated quantity) is less than (1) above
                (D200A computed/scrubbed quantity) the difference will be entered in the lower por-
                tion of the D075 ABCS REPAIR.-B21 with applicable PMS adjustment reason code
                see Attachment 7 for contract or organic items. The difference will be multiplied
                times the USP on the A-D075 B21 to arrive at the dollars to be moved from the AY to
                the Budget Year.
                3.2.6.2.3.4.4. If the result of step 2 (negotiated quantity) is greater than step 1 (D200A
                computed/scrubbed quantity) the difference will be entered in the lower portion of the
                A-D075 ABCS REPAIR.-B21 with applicable PMS adjustment reason code for con-
                tract or organic items. The difference will be multiplied times the Unit Sales Price
                printed on the AD075 ABCS REPAIR.-B21 to arrive at the dollars to be moved from
                the BY to the AY. Example: Unit Sales Price: $1,200 Step 1 AY 3rd and 4th Qtr
                Requirement: 50 Step 2 AY 3rd and 4th Qtr Negotiated Qty: 80 Method of Repair:
                Contract D075 ABCS REPAIR.-B21 coding: CP200 30 $36,000 (AY) A-D075 ABCS
                REPAIR.-B21 coding: CM200 30 $36,000 (BY)
                3.2.6.2.3.4.5. Normally, the A-D075 ABCS REPAIR. -B21 coding relates only to the
                AY and the preparer of column F adjustments/narrative for the transition statements
                will accumulate the adjustments by over induction or under induction by method of
                repair (contract/organic) or FSC and will make the AY adjustment with equal amounts
                (opposite signs) adjusted in the BY. A plus to the AY is a minus to the BY and a minus
                to the AY is a plus to the BY.
                3.2.6.2.3.4.6. It is possible to have over induction in the AY which affects both the BY
                and EY. When this occurs, over/under adjustments must be shown on the A-D075
                ABCS REPAIR.-B21 that relate to all 3 years and the NSN must be identified in the
                column F narrative.
  3.2.7. Description of IMS/Buyer/Seller File Maintenance Data List (AD075 ABCS REPAIR).
     3.2.7.1. These products are identical with the exception that the M51 is routed to the IMS; the
     M52 is routed to the Buyer PMS, and the M54 is routed to the Seller PMS. The elements displayed
     in these reports reflect all the current file maintenance data contained on the D075 ABCS REPAIR
     master file. These products are produced on an as-required basis only and can be requested during
     any bi-weekly or special quarterly D075 ABCS REPAIR processing cycle by notifying the local
     MISTR monitor at the ALC.
     3.2.7.2. Since these products are the only visibility the user has to correct file maintenance to the
     D075 ABCS REPAIR master file, periodic generation of these products should be requested. The
     data elements displayed on these products are as follows:

                                               Chapter 4

                              D/LG PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT

4.1. General. This chapter provides policies and procedures for management of D/LG related workloads
processed for organic repair according to the MISTR system guidelines.

4.2. Scope. This chapter applies to all personnel within the D/LG involved with the MISTR system,
charged with the responsibility of providing workload to organic repair facilities including preplanning,
negotiating, renegotiation and production tracking and analysis. The production management specialists
(PMS) within the D/LG operation divisions involved in MISTR repair are primarily responsible for com-
plying with this chapter.

4.3. Responsibilities: AFMC OPR sent out a format for ALC representative to provide a listing of
MISTR responsibilities for each of the following areas:
   4.3.1. Contract EXPRESS. Awaiting input from ALC representative identifying the functional
   responsibilities in order to accomplish “Contract EXPRESS.”
   4.3.2. Organic EXPRESS. Awaiting input from ALC representative identifying the functional
   responsibilities in order to accomplish “Contract EXPRESS.”
   4.3.3. Non-EXPRESS Contract. The seller PMS establishes and monitors contract repair sources in
   support of MISTR requirements, including DMISA requirements. The CREP, Non-EXPRESS Con-
   tract responsibilities are as follows:
       4.3.3.1. The seller PMS implements CREP tools and principles and/or locally established policy
       and procedures for the overall management of the ALC’s Depot Level Contract Maintenance pro-
       grams.
       4.3.3.2. The seller PMS is the management focal point of the assigned repair contracts and pro-
       vides management and Contract Repair Team (CRT) members with contract repair status via
       charts, reports, briefings, e-mail messages, etc.
       4.3.3.3. After determining the CRT membership, the seller PMS schedules and chairs the CRT
       meetings, as required.
       4.3.3.4. Works with other CRT members in the formulation of the repair requirement and estab-
       lishment of a Purchase Request Package. PR packages may contain but are not limited to the fol-
       lowing documents: AFMC Form 36, Appendix A (Work Specification), Appendix B (Government
       Property Management), Appendix C (Safety Specifications, Statement of Work [SOW]), State-
       ment of Objectives (SOO), Justification and Approval Document, AFMC Form 807 (Recom-
       mended Quality Assurance Provisions and Special Inspection Requirements), Ozone Depleting
       Substance (ODS) statement, Qualification Requirements (QR) or Waiver, Memorandum for
       Record, CDRLs, etc.
       4.3.3.5. The CRT, lead by the seller PMS, determines how much and how often repair require-
       ment is placed on contract in the CREP, non-Express environment. Otherwise, the CREP, Express
       system determines the repair requirement quantity required by the contractor to induct into work
       and how often.
32                                                                     AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006


        4.3.3.6. Ensures the overall repair effort is accomplished to support the repair requirement by
        monitoring the contractor’s progress and participating in the resolution of production constraints
        (i.e., lack of parts, reparables, technical data, funding, etc).
        4.3.3.7. With the removal of repair from the Air Force Working Capital Fund (AFWCF) and the
        planned decommissioning of G072D, there will no longer be a Customer Order Acceptance List
        (COAL) processed.
        4.3.3.8. The seller PMS performs the review of the Contract Asset Visibility System ( CAV II)
        and Maintenance Planning & Execution Program (MP&E) system for accuracy and initiates
        actions to correct any erroneous data.
        4.3.3.9. The Seller PMS participates in the preparation of the repair budget via file maintenance
        of the ABCS REPAIR (D075) system.
        4.3.3.10. Prepares and executes the DMISA, as required.
     4.3.4. Non -EXPRESS Organic. Awaiting input from ALC representative identifying the functional
     responsibilities in order to accomplish “Non-EXPRESS Contract”.
        4.3.4.1. The role of the PMS in the MISTR process is to act as a liaison between the D/LG Item
        Manager and the maintenance activities. The PMS negotiates requirements with maintenance,
        monitors induction and production, resolves or helps resolve scheduling/production problems, and
        renegotiates workloads as necessary. The PMS is the local point in the D/LG for all repair related
        questions/resolutions.
        4.3.4.2. While the IMS/MM function is concerned primarily with stating and validating the repair
        requirement, the PMS is concerned with the practical aspects of getting resources with which to do
        the repairs; i.e., the PMS must make every effort to prevent overobligation of funds.
        4.3.4.3. Requirements are normally computed by the D200A or D200C systems, and are validated
        by the IMS. Upon receipt of the requirement, the PMS must first determine whether the require-
        ment should be offered to the maintenance activity. If there is a known scheduling, production,
        parts, or other problem which cannot be resolved by the negotiation period, the unsupportable
        quantity will be explained by a beginning negotiation code at the negotiation conference. The
        PMS is authorized to reduce or delete the quantities in the negotiation quarter with an equal
        increase in subsequent quarters. All changes for carcass deficits must be coordinated with the
        IMS.
        4.3.4.4. Of primary importance to the PMS is that funds must be obligated upon input of an item
        to work. Both net input and output requirements will be negotiated with maintenance.
        4.3.4.5. Specific procedures that must be followed during prenegotiation, negotiation, drive and
        analysis phases, are found in paragraphs 4.4. through 4.11.

4.4. Specific Procedures. The responsibilities of the PMS within the production management branch in
support of the MISTR system are:
     4.4.1. Receive, review, and determine the mission-essential status of repair requirements. The repair
     source of organic workloads will be assigned according to as directed by higher headquarters.
     4.4.2. Monitor maintenance production accomplishment, and act as a liaison between repair facilities
     and other LG organizations.
AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006                                                                              33


   4.4.3. Ensure, to the extent possible, that all IMS requirements are supportable before negotiation
   within the organic facility.
   4.4.4. Use MISTR data to:
      4.4.4.1. Identify and resolve scheduling and production problems.
      4.4.4.2. Determine status of accomplishments.
      4.4.4.3. Prepare necessary charts, reports, and analysis for internal use and submission to requir-
      ing activities.
   4.4.5. Ensure that the IMS is properly informed of the transition of items from ICS, CLS, or RIW into
   the MISTR system.
   4.4.6. Annotate the negotiation document with:
      4.4.6.1. PMS Adjustment Reason Code for budgeting purposes. (See Attachment 7.
      4.4.6.2. Beginning negotiation codes for each quarterly cycle.
      4.4.6.3. Other information mandated by local guidance.

4.5. Negotiation Planning.
   4.5.1. Prenegotiation Process:
      4.5.1.1. The success of any repair system depends to a large extent upon realistic negotiations
      with the SOR. Therefore, before negotiating a quarterly repair requirement with an SOR, the
      requirement must be thoroughly reviewed. This is to ensure that all factors used in the requirement
      computation are as accurate as possible, that the requirement is in support of mission-essential
      system or functions, and all known program changes affecting the requirement have been consid-
      ered. These functions are accomplished by the IM and ES during the 18-month period before the
      requirements are made known to the PMS. The ultimate goal of the workload negotiations is to
      develop a preproduction plan that identifies the essential workloads to be done within the capabil-
      ity of the SOR. Upon receipt of the PLC from each SOR, to make sure it is complete and legible.
      In the event an error is discovered, telephone coordination with the appropriate organization is
      effected before further processing. After all discrepancies have been corrected, along with the
      AD075 ABCS REPAIR.-B21 file maintenance. Submission of the PLC is optional at each ALC.
      4.5.1.2. The A-D075 ABCS REPAIR.-B21 is the first pre-negotiation document to be received by
      the PMS. This document has already been verified by the IM organization. Upon receipt, the PMS
      will carefully review each item to verify that it is an acceptable candidate for negotiation during
      that particular quarter.
   4.5.2. PMS Workload Adjustment Error List (A-D075 ABCS REPAIR.). Transactions are vali-
   dated and used to overlay the projected repair requirements shown on the A-D075 ABCS
   REPAIR.B21 worksheet or are identified as errors on the PMS Error List document. This document
   will display the erroneous adjustment transaction and the reason for the error.
      4.5.2.1. Heading:
          4.5.2.1.1. Buyer PMS - The three-digit code of the PMS responsible for initiating this transac-
          tion.
34                                                                     AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006


           4.5.2.1.2. Processing Date - The day, month, and year the product is prepared.
           4.5.2.1.3. Processing Period - Two-digit code identifying the current MISTR period.
        4.5.2.2. Columns:
           4.5.2.2.1. Transaction Image - The 80-character adjustment transaction as entered by a PMS.
           4.5.2.2.2. Error Message assigned to identify the erroneous transaction.
           4.5.2.2.3. Unmatched MSN (I, N, or O) - This transaction did not match any master stock
           number projected for repair by D075 ABCS REPAIR.
           4.5.2.2.4. Invalid Qty Fields/Qty Ident- Quantity fields contain non-numeric data or the trans-
           action quantity identifier is not “I, N, or O.”
           4.5.2.2.5. Dupe Trans NSN/Quantity ID - Two or more transactions were entered for a given
           master stock number and quantity identifier.

4.6. Negotiation.
     4.6.1. MISTR Master Files:
        4.6.1.1. The D075 ABCS REPAIR MISTR Master File is maintained by the Item Management
        Branch.
        4.6.1.2. The G019C MISTR Master File is maintained by the LGP organization. Changes to quan-
        tity fields (negotiation/renegotiation) must bear the signature of the responsible PMS, IMS, and
        Production Control as applicable before file maintenance can be authorized. The PMS must fur-
        nish changes to stock numbers, nouns, system application, DMCs, renegotiations, PMS codes, and
        quarterly requirements to LGP.
     4.6.2. Negotiation Documents:
        4.6.2.1. ABCS-REPAIR Quarterly Projection Worksheet, A-D075 ABCS REPAIR.-B21. This
        document is used to validate repair requirements before preparation of the WSO. It establishes the
        negotiation requirement, which is the validated requirement. It is also a primary document used by
        the PMS in negotiating workload requirements with the applicable SOR. Other valuable data such
        as TOC assets, F items (items which can be modified up to the actual stock number appearing on
        the A-D075 ABCS REPAIR.B21, priority 1-15 backorders, serviceable and reparable in-transit
        data, condition “G” assets, OWO, AWP, and AWN data appear on this product. The A-D075
        ABCS REPAIR.-B21 may be used as a negotiation document at the option of the ALCs.
        4.6.2.2. Negotiation Finalization. After all negotiations are computed, the negotiated net input
        and output quantities will be file maintained into G019C.* The WSO, D075 ABCS REPAIR or
        AFMC Form 800/801 must be signed by maintenance and the PMS to substantiate the quantity in
        the master file. Applicable beginning negotiation codes will be agreed upon by the PMS and main-
        tenance at this time.
        4.6.2.3. All AFMC Forms 800, Item Manager Workload Projection Summary used for nego-
        tiating new items or items currently in the G019C MISTR master file for which no mechanized
        ABCS-REPAIR Quarterly Projection Worksheet was produced, must be annotated by the IMS as
        to why the factors in the D200A/D200C systems were not adequate to produce a mechanized
        product. Additionally, a statement must be made about what corrective action is being taken.
AFMCI23-112 7 MARCH 2006                                                                                 35


   4.6.3. Post Negotiation Procedures. After negotiations have been completed, the negotiation docu-
   ment will be annotated to provide a clear statement of all workloads that could not be satisfied. Main-
   tenance will, to the extent possible, provide the capability required to satisfy all supportable customer
   requirements. When supportable requirements exceed the manpower/skill, facility, or equipment lim-
   itations, the SOR and the ALC D/LG will submit a coordinated recommendation to HQ AFMC/ to sat-
   isfy this requirement.
   4.6.4. Interim Negotiation. New requirement generating between negotiation periods will be
   worked in the Depot Maintenance Information System (DMIS). The PMS may negotiate the indicated
   workload by personal contact if the SOR is local or by telephone if the SOR is another ALC.
   4.6.5. Insurance and Numerical Stockage Objective (NSO) Type Items. These type items’ repair
   requirements are computed by the D200A System and will automatically be output on the
   ABCS-REPAIR Quarterly Projection Worksheet as a “Dummy.” Insurance/NSO identification will be
   reflected in the header portion of this product. A complete description is contained in Paragraph
   3.2.2.2..

4.7. Renegotiation.
   4.7.1. Bi-weekly Renegotiation Actions:
      4.7.1.1. Items are subject to renegotiation actions each two weeks. The PMS must initiate renego-
      tiation action immediately when a production or induction schedule cannot be met because of a
      problem, which cannot be corrected during the current quarter. When this condition occurs, the
      items-negotiated quantity will be reduced to that amount which is appropriate. When there is a
      change in requirements it will not be reduced below the amount on work order plus the amount
      produced. As with all renegotiations, the IMS and the CCA within the D/LG must coordinate on
      the renegotiation request. However, in this case, it serves as information and will not be overrid-
      den. The PMS must review the AD075 ABCS REPAIR and, along with the IMS, determine
      whether renegotiation is appropriate. Having a requirement is not a valid reason for maintaining a
      negotiated quantity when it becomes obvious that induction/production cannot be accomplished.
      If the requirement negotiated was obviously understated, the quantity may be increased.
      4.7.1.2. All renegotiations must be sent to the LG Central Control Authority for approval. See
      Chapter 3, Section D, Paragraph 3.18. for the approval criteria.
      4.7.1.3. When a validated Mission Capability (MICAP) exists on an item that can be repaired, and
      the negotiated amount is insufficient to cover the MICAP, renegotiation of the item will be
      required. If this condition occurs between bi-weekly periods, the PMS will immediately contact
      and request an increased quantity to cover the MICAP. This will be followed up with an AFMC
      804 inquiry within two workdays if an increase in the total quarters negotiation is required.

4.8. Reports and Analysis.
   4.8.1. MISTR IM Projected Workload Reports (G019C-C21 through C27 Series). These reports
   show negotiated versus actual input to date by quarter, and negotiated versus actual output to date by
   quarter. This data is produced bi-weekly plus an EOM report. These reports may be used for tracking
   the status of items, classes, etc.

        4.8.2.1. The D075 ABCS REPAIR portion of the MISTR processing cycle has Wednesday and
        Sunday runs scheduled on a bi-weekly basis. Actions and schedule time periods are as follows:
        DAY                                             ACTION


        WEDNESDAY                                      WE Process
        Inputs: D143B tape as of Thursday, the week before WE. D035/D034 tape as of Sunday before
        WE. Most current bi-weekly master tape.
        Outputs: Updated bi-weekly master tape. Local SOR data that goes into C3-G019C
        (locally). Other SOR data which is transmitted to BDN Site X for other ALCs’
        C3-G019C.


        The interface file, which is created for G019C during the WE process, contains the Precedence 5
        output requirements, priority 1-15 backorders, and the adjusted quarterly requirement. Each ALC
        transmits this data to the SOR ALCs.


        SUNDAY
        SU Process


        Inputs: Key-to-Disk (bi-weekly file maintenance) tape runs Friday prior to SU. D143B tape as of
        Thursday before SU. C2-G019C as of Saturday before SU. The CAV II built early part of each
        month. C5-G019C built on Saturday prior to SU. D035/ same as WE process. D143H same as of
        date as D035/ tape. Bi-weekly master tape (most current).


        Outputs: Local overlay tape which interfaces with C1-G019G. Other ALCs’ overlay interface
        tapes for their C1-G019C run. Bi-weekly drive data. DDDR data. Precedence 1-4 summary.
        Updated bi-weekly master tape.
        4.8.2.2. The interface file which is created for G019C during the SU process contains the SOR
        overlay data (DMC, MIEC, condemnation percent). G019C references this as the J-FILE for C1.
        Each ALC transmits this data to the SOR ALCs.
        4.8.2.3. D143B provides cataloging management data (IMS, ES, PMIC, ERRC). D035 provides
        backorders, assets, demand rates. D143H provides in-transit, TOC, incomplete asset data (repara-
        bles). The CAV II provides contractor data. G019C provides organic production data. Products
        output from the SU D075 ABCS REPAIR process are the R51, R52, R53, and the M53 as
        described in Paragraphs 3-12 and 4-16.
     4.8.3. MISTR Repair Notice Listing. A-D075 ABCS REPAIR.- products are described in detail in
     Paragraph 3-12: The AD075 ABCS REPAIR report is very similar to the A-D075 ABCS REPAIR. It
     will be used by the PMS as a tool to determine when renegotiation action is required. For instance, if
     the serviceables on-hand equal the quarter’s negotiated quantity, that item will be reviewed as a candi-

  date for a decrease renegotiation. If the item is identified for renegotiation upwards, the item must be
  supportable with due-in or on-hand carcasses. The PMS and IMS/MM must act as a team with the
  common goal of maintaining a supportable negotiation. The PMS has the authority for decreasing
  item quantities that cannot be inducted or produced because of maintenance difficulties (parts unavail-
  able for the balance of the quarter, test equipment breakdowns, etc). The PMS must advise the IMS of
  any changes in quantity.

                                         NEGOTIATION CODES

A1.1. Negotiation codes will be input to provide the reason for the difference in the D075 ABCS REPAIR
validated requirement and the negotiated requirement (requirement agreed upon by Production Manage-
ment Specialist and Workloader at face-to-face negotiation). The D075 ABCS REPAIR validated require-
ment will be taken from the D075 ABCS REPAIR.-B21 or the Workload Source Objective. This quantity
may be manually annotated. Beginning negotiation codes apply to output quantities only. These codes
will be jointly determined by Production Management Specialist and Workloader and entered on the A4
portion of the MISTR Maintenance (A-G019C-CAH-CA-MCQ) change document. Coding will be done
by Actual Stock Number and will include the following in addition to the code itself.
     A1.1.1. Codes will be prefixed with a “P” or “N” when input on the change document for G019C to
     signify that negotiation is greater “P” than the D075 ABCS REPAIR requirement or less “N” than the
     D075 ABCS REPAIR requirement.
     A1.1.2. Codes will also be accompanied with a D075 ABCS REPAIR requirement and the negotiated
     quantity. The total quantity of difference for all actual stock numbers within a subgroup must equal the
     quantity of difference for the group. The quantity may be coded against any one of the ANSN or
     spread among all ANSNs; however, the total quantity must equal the total quantity or difference for
     the subgroup.

A1.2. The following codes will be used:

 DEFICIT DEFINITION AND ACTIONS
  CODE
     A      Technical Data. Required technical information (TOs, MIL Specs, etc. as defined in
            AFLCR 66-51) was not available or was inadequate.
            MA Actions. MAS or MAP will notify MAE that the problem exists. MAE will take
            action to resolve the problem, and will provide MAWW and MAS with a statement of the
            problem and the estimated date of resolution. This information will enable MAWW and
            MAS to determine the need for renegotiation.
            MM Action. Production Management will coordinate with MAWW and Engineering/
            Reliability to ensure that the required data is provided to the D/M. If the data does not exist,
            Engineering/Reliability will provide supplemental instructions to MAWW within one
            MISTR production period.
     B      Equipment. Required production and/or test equipment was not available, inadequate,
            incomplete, or could not be used pending repair or calibration.
            MA Action. MAS and MAP will notify MAE that the problem exists. In the case of
            support equipment, MAE will provide MAWW and MAS with a statement of the problem
            and the estimated date of resolution. For test equipment, MAP will notify the responsible
            organization for repair/calibration. That organization will evaluate the problem and provide
            status information, including estimated completion date(s). This information will enable
            MAWW and MA_S to determine the need for renegotiation.
            MM Action. For support equipment, Production Management will coordinate with
            MAWW and Engineering/Reliability to ensure that help is provided to resolve the problem.
            When required, Engineering/Reliability will provide the equipment required. For test
            equipment, Production Management, in coordination with Engineering/Reliability, will
            assist maintenance as necessary. If other equipment can be made available to do the task in
            less time than is necessary to repair or calibrate the item, it will be provided.
     D      Capability. Manhours available have been applied in rank MIEC sequence to the driven
            requirement and these items could not be reached this month because their MIEC was too
            low. This deficit code will include lack of manpower, RGC “J” MICAP, repair in process
            and higher priority workload.
            MA Action. MA_S will evaluate the negotiated workload to determine if requirements are
            excessive. If renegotiation is required, MA_S/MAWW will immediately notify Production
            Management of the situation.
            MM Action. Upon notification by MAWW that the problem exists, Production
            Management will determine the workload item(s) to be reduced and will submit an AFLC
            Form 804 to reduce the requirement. This will be done in coordination with the applicable
            requirements section chief and MAWW.

    E    Software Not Available. Required software was not available, inadequate or incomplete.
         MA Action. MA_S will notify MA_E that the problem exists. MA_E will provide MAWW
         and MA_S with a statement of the problem and the estimated date of resolution. This
         information will enable MAWW and MA_S to determine the need for renegotiation.
         MM Action. Production Management will coordinate with MAWW and Engineering/
         Reliability to ensure that help is provided to resolve the problem.
    N    Parts not available. A shortage of direct or indirect material (parts) existed (late receipt of
         parts, unplanned and planned).
         MA Action. MA_S will determine the organization responsible for the parts problem and
         notify Production Management of the necessary action. MA_S will follow up to make sure
         the problem is being resolved and, as required, provide information to MAWW for possible
         renegotiation.
         MM Action. Obtain assistance from MA, DS or PM. Determine whether the shortage is
         due to insufficient distribution priorities that have inhibited acquisition, untimely buy
         actions, inadequate order quantities, or poor supplier support. Based on the problem
         encountered, take internal action, expedite shipment from the supply point or establish new
         source. The item will be renegotiated downward when the shortage cannot be corrected in
         sufficient time to allow the remaining quarterly quantity to be produced.
   O     Assets Not Available. Reparable or TOC assets were not available in depot supply to
         permit work accomplishment. This deficit case includes warehouse refusal, misidentified
         end items. Condemned assets and late receipt of assets.
         MA Action. For asset generation, MA_S will access total asset availability for support of
         quarterly negotiated requirement. If assets are not generating in sufficient quantities, advise
         MAWW of the need to renegotiate. For warehouse refusal, MA_S will coordinate with
         depot supply concerning corrective action related to supply generated assets. For
         misidentified end items, MA_S will ensure immediate turn-in of the misidentified items.
         MA_S will notify MAWW of the specific workload status and work hours requiring
         renegotiation. For condemned assets, MA_S will ensure that all condemned items are
         immediately turned in so that later reports will not reflect assets available for work that are
         actually in a condemned condition. For late receipt of assets, MA_S will determine the
         organization responsible. When D/M is causing the problem, MA_S will take immediate
         corrective action. If the D/MM is effecting timely requisition actions, MA_S will take
         immediate action to resolve the problem with depot supply.

         MM Action. Production Management will notify the IMS to determine whether the items
         are generating in the quantities anticipated. If sufficient assets do no appear to be
         generating to cover the quarters negotiation, the PMS/IMS will take action to renegotiate
         the item downward. For warehouse refusal, the IMS will contact DS directly if the problem
         cannot be corrected. The IMS may need to take inventory action. For misidentified items,
         the IMS will take action as necessary to decrease the inventory or work with depot supply
         to determine location or status of the actual end item. For condemned assets, no action is
         required. These items will be mechanically reduced from the inventory and funds will be
         obligated.
     R   Revised Requirement. Requirements have been recently increased/decreased through
         renegotiation.
         MA Action. MA_S will determine that a corresponding decrease in workload has been
         negotiated
         MM Action. If corresponding renegotiation is required, Production Management will
         determine which workload will be decreased and initiate an AFLC Form 804 for
         processing.
     Z   Error. The computer will apply this code mechanically when any insufficient quantity has
         been deficit coded.
         MA Action. The MA_S branch chief will review all Z deficit codes each month to
         anticipate errors in deficit code application and take corrective action.

                         MISSION ITEM ESSENTIALITY CODE (MIEC)
The MIEC is assigned to each MISTR item and it reflects the relative importance of the item to the mis-
sion of the Air Force. This three-position code is structured as follows:
    a. The first position is based on the AFMC Logistics Support Priority (LSP) Indexes, which are
derived using the USAF Precedence Rating. This position reflects the relative importance of the weapon
system to the mission of the Air Force.
       (1) Code 1-LSP 1.00 through 1.95
       (2) Code 2-LSP 2.00 through 2.95
       (3) Code 3-LSP 3.00 through 5.95
       (4) Code 4-LSP 6.00 through 7.95
       (5) Code 5-LSP 8.00 through 13.95
       (6) Code 6-LSP 14.00 through 25.95
    b. The second position reflects the essentiality of the subsystem to the weapon system. This position
is determined with the assistance of the using major commands.
       (1) Code A - Weapon system is not capable of any mission when subsystem is not operating.
      (2) Code B - Weapon system is not capable of its primary designed operational capability, but has
   some limited secondary capability, when subsystem is not operating.
      (3) Code C - Weapon system is limited in its primary designed operational capability, but is not
   capable of secondary capabilities, when subsystem is not operating.
       (4) Code D -Subsystem is used for peacetime training.
   c. The third position reflects the importance of the MISTR items to the operation of the subsystem:
       (1) Code E - Critical to the operation of the subsystem.
       (2) Code F - Impairs the operation of the subsystem.
       (3) Code G - Not critical to the operation of the subsystem.

The MIECs are used to establish priorities for both workloading and scheduling. During workload nego-
tiations, the capability of the Directorate of Maintenance is to be applied to workloading items in the
MIEC priority sequence. This MISTR Consolidated Schedule for S-GEN items is also arranged in MIEC
priority sequence. The scheduler will schedule items into production sequence when permitted by the
constraints of skills, repair parts and reparable asset availability. The descending priority sequence of the
MIECs is shown in the following table.
