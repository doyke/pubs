                                          Chapter 1

                                  PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Applicability.
   1.1.1. This Instruction contains the minimum elements required to implement an acceptable
   installation-level respiratory protection program and should be used as the installation-level
   (or unit if tenant on installation) respiratory protection program. It applies to operations
   performed by Department of the Air Force civilians and military employees and direct hire
   foreign nationals (as established by Status of Forces Agreements) of the AF, ANG, and
   AFRC. This Instruction does not apply to government-owned, contractor-operated
   operations. Specific requirements and procedures that apply to uniquely military respiratory
   protective devices designed for use in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN)
   contaminated environments are identified in this Instruction. Uniquely military respiratory
   protective devices shall not be used for protection of workers in non-uniquely military work
   environments such as an industrial workplace.
   1.1.2. The specific requirements outlined in this Instruction are based on 29 CFR 1910.134
   requirements at the time of publication. Should additional OSHA requirements be published
   that are more stringent than the requirements in this Instruction, they shall apply and this
   Instruction shall be changed. The respiratory protection requirements outlined for specific
   contaminants in Title 29, CFR Part 1910, Subpart Z, Toxic and Hazardous Substances, Parts
   1926.1101-1152 (not all inclusive), and Part 1926.62, Lead, shall apply. Additionally, the
   respiratory protection requirements in Title 10, CFR Part 20, Standards for Protection
   Against Radiation, also apply.
1.2. Respirator Use. Whether respirator use is required or voluntary, unless otherwise specified
in this Instruction, all requirements apply to all respirator use. Special use circumstances are
described in paragraph 4.2. (T-1)
   1.2.1. Required. Respirator use shall be required by the workplace supervisor when notified
   by Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE):
       1.2.1.1. That other means of control do not reduce exposure below the occupational or
       environmental exposure limit (OEEL); (T-0)
       1.2.1.2. That other means of control are not feasible (this may include use during
       intermittent, non-routine operations); (T-0)
       1.2.1.3. That use is specified by an OSHA standard or AF directive. Some substance-
       specific OSHA standards, such as the Lead Standard, require the employer to provide
       workers with respirators whenever they request them, even if exposures are below
       applicable OEELs; (T-0)
       1.2.1.4. For use as an interim measure while permanent controls are awaiting funding, or
       being designed or installed; (T-0)
       1.2.1.5. That, in the professional opinion of the Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE),
       exposures could potentially be greater than OEEL; (T-0)
6                                                                  AFI48-137 15 JULY 2014


       1.2.1.6. That emergency situations could dictate use of respiratory protection. See
       paragraph 4.2 for requirements for escape-only respirators. (T-0)
    1.2.2. Voluntary. Voluntary use respirators will not be worn by government employees in
    AF industrial workplaces except for filtering face-pieces as described in paragraph 4.1 and
    when authorized by BE. BE will authorize voluntary use after verifying the use does not
    create a hazard to the employee. Voluntary use of respirators must be conducted IAW 29
    CFR 1910.134. (T-0)
AFI48-137 15 JULY 2014                                                                        7

          3.3.1.3.7. Expected physical work effort involved in the process requiring respiratory
          protection. OSHA’s 29 CFR 1910.134 (e)(5)(i)(C) requires a statement on the
          expected physical work effort. See also 29 CFR 1910.134 Appendix C, Part B. (T-0)

   3.3.2. Surveillance of Respirator Use. Supervisors shall ensure that approved respirators in
   their workplace are used, are used correctly and in good condition. (T-1)
   3.3.3. Determination of Degree of Exposure. It is the supervisor's duty to inform BE of
   workplace changes such as changes in operations, processes, chemicals/materials, or
   workplace environment, so monitoring may be accomplished if necessary. (T-1)
3.4. Purchasing of Respirators.
   3.4.1. Purchase respirators through the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS). The stock
   class for respirators is 4240. Organizations that use respirators are responsible for purchasing
   approved respirators and parts for the respirator's operation and maintenance.
   3.4.2. Special levels of respirators may be established in base supply as specified in Air
   Force Handbook (AFH) 23-123, Vol 2, Integrated Logistics System-Supply, by BE and
   issued to the wearer immediately after fit testing. BE is the approval authority for
   establishing special levels and initiates the AF Form 1996, Adjusted Stock Level, as needed.
   3.4.3. BE will maintain an adequate selection of respirators to be used for fit-tests so all
   workers can be fitted; however, attempt to keep the number of respirator brands to a
   minimum. (T-2)
3.5. Inventory Control of New Respirators and Spare Parts.
   3.5.1. Inventory control should be a shared responsibility among BE, base supply, and
   supervisors who oversee respirator use on the job. Inventory control not only prevents
   untrained personnel from receiving respirators, but will also ensure that there are enough
   respirators for trained personnel.
   3.5.2. Supervisors will ensure an ample supply of spare parts are on hand so that a
   designated person can perform proper replacement or repair. Spare parts have their own
   national stock number (NSN) so the exact ones can be ordered. (T-0)
   3.5.3. Spare parts for respirator repair will be installed according to the manufacturer's
   instructions so as not to invalidate the NIOSH certification. The manufacturer of the given
   respirator and spare parts shall be the same. Using a different manufacturer's part invalidates
   the NIOSH certification, and is not authorized.
3.6. Environmental Considerations. Used respirator filters/cartridges shall be disposed of
according to applicable federal, state, and local environmental regulations. Supervisors will
consult installation environmental management for the state or local disposal guidelines. Paint

                              RESPIRATOR LIMITATIONS

4.1. Use of FFPDs
   4.1.1. Employees must request an evaluation of their individual work conditions by BE if
   they are not already on the respiratory protection program prior to wearing a voluntary use
   respirator. (T-1)
   4.1.2. FFPDs (i.e., N-95, N-99, etc.) are the only type of respiratory protection that may be
   worn at the discretion of a government employee “for comfort purposes” in an AF industrial
   workplace and must be approved and authorized by BE. Elective use FFPDs will not be used
   in place of respiratory protection specified by BE for protection against specific hazards in
   the workplace.
   4.1.3. Personnel who wear voluntary use FFPDs must receive initial and annual training
   from their supervisors on the appropriate use of the device, including its limitations per 29
   CFR 1910.134 (c)(2) and Appendix D. (T-0)
4.2. Escape-Only Respirators. See Attachment 3 (Selection Options for Escape-Only
Respirators) and the “NIOSH Guide to Industrial Respiratory Protection.”
4.3. Respirator Limitations. In addition to the following, refer to the requirements in 29 CFR
1910.134:
   4.3.1. Communications. Ambient environmental noise and communication needs shall be
   considered when specific respirators are selected. See Attachment 4. (T-2)
   4.3.2. Eye Irritation. If contaminants cause eye irritation, full facepiece respirators or
   chemical protective goggles with half facepiece respirators shall be worn. (T-0)
   4.3.3. Respirator Use in Low Temperature Environments. Low temperatures may cause
   detrimental effects on the performance of respirators. The effects of low temperatures shall
   be considered in the selection and maintenance of respirators and respirable gas supplies. See
   Attachment 5. (T-2)
   4.3.4. Respirator Use In High Temperature Environments. High temperatures may affect the
   performance of the respirator, and may add undue physiological stress. The effects of high
   temperatures shall be considered in respirator selection and for medical approvals. See
   Attachment 6. (T-2)
4.4. Spectacle Inserts. Refer to AFJI 44-117, Ophthalmic Services, for determination of
benefits and authorizations for spectacle inserts for use with respirators. (T-2)
 20                                                                  AFI48-137 15 JULY 2014


                                           Chapter 5

                                 MEDICAL EVALUATION

5.1. General Information. Potential respirator wearers will complete a respirator medical
evaluation questionnaire and may receive a physical examination prior to initial fit testing to
identify existing medical conditions that would place the worker at an increased health risk from
the use of a respirator or interfere with the use or wear of a respirator. The OSHA standard (29
CFR 1910.134 (e) and Appendix C) specifies the minimum mandatory requirements for medical
evaluations.
5.2. Respirator Questionnaires and Medical Evaluations.
   5.2.1. The medical evaluation consists, at a minimum, of completing the respirator medical
   evaluation questionnaire for PLHCP review, and is only an initial requirement. There is no
   requirement to re-accomplish respirator medical evaluation questionnaires annually,
   however, medical evaluation will need to be redone under certain circumstances (i.e., job
   duty change, respiratory protection changes, relocation to a new duty location, etc.) as
   determined by BE. At a minimum, the mandatory questions stated in the 29 CFR 1910.134,
   Appendix C, will be used. In addition to the mandatory questions, OSHA’s optional
   questions and other questions developed locally may be used. The current respiratory
   questionnaire must be filed in the individual’s medical record.
   5.2.2. All health care providers conducting medical evaluations and reviewing completed
   respirator medical evaluation questionnaires for the respiratory protection program will be
   PLHCPs, as defined in 29 CFR 1910.134 (b).
   5.2.3. PH (or OMS) will provide the evaluating PLHCP a copy of 29 CFR
   1910.134(e)(5)(i)(A-E) and at least Chapter 5 of this Instruction. PH (or OMS) will ensure a
   copy of the workplace-specific written program from the worker’s workplace is available for
   the medical evaluation. The worker should provide this when he/she turns in his/her
   completed respiratory questionnaire. The PLHCP must review the physical work effort
   statement within the workplace-specific written program as part of the medical evaluation.
   5.2.4. Following review of the respirator medical evaluation questionnaire, follow-up
   medical evaluation, if needed, and the information required in 5.2.3, the PLHCP will
   determine the worker’s ability to use a respirator.
   5.2.5. The PLHCP’s written recommendation will include only the information required in
   29 CFR 1910.134 (e)(6). To maintain the confidentiality of the respirator medical evaluation
   questionnaire, the PLHCP’s recommendation will be documented on a separate form or letter
   – not on or attached to the questionnaire itself.
       5.2.5.1. When the PLHCP recommends the worker can wear a respirator without
       restrictions, the written recommendation will be filed in the medical record and a copy
       given to the worker and the worker’s supervisor; BE will be formally notified (i.e., a copy
       of written recommendation or other notification as determined by the installation) to
       proceed with fit testing.
       5.2.5.2. When a worker recovers from a medical condition that leads to respirator wear
       restrictions, the PLHCP's recommendations will be re-accomplished and annotated in the
AFI48-137 15 JULY 2014                                                                        21


      individual's medical record; distributed to the worker, the worker's supervisor or civilian
      personnel office (if applicable); and BE will be notified (i.e., a copy of written
      recommendation or other notification as determined by the installation) to proceed with
      fit testing.
      5.2.5.3. When a worker recovers from a medical condition that lead to respirator wear
      restrictions, the PLHCP’s recommendation will be re-accomplished and annotated in the
      individual’s medical record, and distributed to the worker, the worker’s supervisor or
      civilian personnel office (if applicable), and BE will be notified (in case a new fit test
      needs to be accomplished).
      5.2.5.4. When the PLHCP recommends against respirator use, the written
      recommendation will be placed in the worker’s medical record, with copies given to the
      worker, the worker’s supervisor, and, if the worker is civilian, the civilian personnel
      office. BE will be formally notified.
5.3. Follow-up Medical Evaluations.
   5.3.1. Based on worker’s answers on the respirator medical evaluation questionnaire, a
   follow-up medical evaluation may be required. The follow-up medical evaluation is required
   if the criteria in 29 CFR 1910.134 (e)(3) are met. Additional criteria may be established
   locally.
   5.3.2. Pulmonary function studies are often included in respirator certification evaluations,
   however, they are not reliable in predicting who can and cannot wear a respirator. They
   should not be routinely performed. Thus it is recommended that spirometry, chest x-rays and
   other tests are only conducted when clinically indicated.
   5.3.3. There are no annual or periodic requirements for medical reevaluations. Refer to 29
   CFR 1910.134 (e)(7) for the minimum criteria for medical reevaluations.
 22                                                                   AFI48-137 15 JULY 2014


                                           Chapter 6

                        CARE, INSPECTION, AND MAINTENANCE

6.1. General Discussion. Each individual issued a respirator is responsible for its primary
maintenance and care. Where respirators are used collectively or kept ready for emergencies by a
workplace or operating activity, the supervisor of the activity is responsible for establishing a
respirator maintenance and cleaning program as specified in 29 CFR 1910.134. This program
shall include care, inspection, and maintenance of respirators.
6.2. Care of Respirators.
   6.2.1. Cleaning and Disinfecting. In addition to the requirements in 29 CFR 1910.134,
   respirators issued to an individual shall be cleaned and disinfected, at a minimum, using a
   respirator wipe at the end of each day in which the respirator is used. Each respirator shall be
   thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before being worn by a different individual. Emergency
   use respirators shall be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after being used. Refer to 29 CFR
   1910.134, Appendix B-2 for additional information. (T-0)
   6.2.2. Storage. All respirators shall be stored to protect them from damage, contamination,
   dust, sunlight, extreme temperatures, excessive moisture, and damaging chemicals, and they
   shall be packed or stored to prevent deformation of the facepiece and exhalation valve. (T-0)
   6.2.3. Respirable Air and Oxygen for SCBA and Air-line Respirators. Compressed gaseous
   air, compressed gaseous oxygen, liquid air, and liquid oxygen used for respiration shall be of
   high purity and tested according to T.O. 42B-1-22 and 29 CFR 1910.134(i). (T-0)
   6.2.4. Inspection.
       6.2.4.1. Inspect respirators per 29 CFR 1910.134, except for installation emergency and
       first responder SCBAs, which will follow NFPA 1852 inspection requirements. (T-0)
       6.2.4.2. OSHA and NFPA do not require a specific form to document user inspections,
       maintenance or functional tests for respirators. At a minimum, documentation will
       include the date, name of person conducting the inspection or test, and results.
       Respirators that do not meet applicable inspection criteria shall be immediately and
       clearly marked as unserviceable, removed from service and repaired or replaced. (T-1)
   6.2.5. Maintenance.
       6.2.5.1. The maintenance and repair of respirators will be accomplished per 29 CFR
       1910.134(h).
       6.2.5.2. Filters/cartridges of air-purifying respirators shall be changed before the end of
       their service life per the filter/cartridge change-out schedule developed by BE. See
       Attachment 7 for guidance on developing change-out schedules or consult USAFSAM.
       6.2.5.3. If, at any time a worker detects an increase in breathing resistance, smells or
       tastes the contaminant, or detects the irritant properties of the contaminant the worker
       should immediately leave the area and replace the filter/cartridge.
AFI48-137 15 JULY 2014                                                                       23


      6.2.5.4. If the filters/cartridges on an air-purifying respirator are not replaceable, the
      respirator shall be replaced when one of the conditions in paragraph 6.2.5.2 or
      paragraph 6.2.5.3 are met.
6.3. Ambient or Free-Air Pumps and Compressors. The workplace supervisor is responsible
for inspecting ambient or free-air pumps and compressors used with air-line (supplied-air)
systems:
   6.3.1. The pumps shall be located in a position to avoid entry of contaminated air into the
   system. (T-0)
   6.3.2. Air-line couplings shall be incompatible with outlets for other gas systems to prevent
   inadvertent servicing of air-line respirators with other gases or oxygen. (T-0)
   6.3.3. An inspection of the air-line, compressor and respirator shall be conducted to ensure
   all three components match the air pressure and other requirements specified by the
   manufacturers. (T-0)
   6.3.4. Document any maintenance activities (i.e., filter change-out, oil changes, routine
   preventive maintenance, etc.) on pumps on AF Form 1071, Inspection/Maintenance Record
   or IAW local procedures. (T-1)
 24                                                                AFI48-137 15 JULY 2014

Terms
Shall—Indicates a mandatory requirement.
Will—Indicates a mandatory requirement that expresses a declaration of intent, probability or
determination.
Should—Indicates a preferred method of accomplishment.
May—Indicates an acceptable or satisfactory method of accomplishment.
Air-line Respirator—An atmosphere-supplying respirator in which the respirable gas is not
designed to be carried by the wearer, and which uses air delivered under pressure through a hose
(formally called Supplied Air Respirators).
Ambient Air Pump—An electrical or pneumatically driven positive displacement pump which
takes ambient air and provides it to a respirator at pressures of less than 25 pounds per square
inch gauge (psig). This is also known as a "free-air" pump.
Approved Respirator—An approved device designed to provide the wearer with respiratory
protection against inhalation of harmful atmospheres. The respirator shall be tested and listed by
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Refer to the latest NIOSH
Certified Equipment List for approved respirators. If a tight-fitting respirator is used, the
respirator shall have a design which allows the following tests to be performed: (1) Positive and
negative pressure tests, and (2) Fit test.
Assigned Protection Factor (APF)—Minimum level of respiratory protection provided by a
properly functioning respirator or a class of respirators used in a specific workplace by properly
fitted and trained users.
Maximum Use Concentration (MUC)—The lowest of the following: (1) The occupational
exposure limit multiplied by the assigned protection factor; (2) The “immediately dangerous to
 28                                                                  AFI48-137 15 JULY 2014


life and health” concentration; and (3) The maximum contaminant concentration for the given
filter/cartridge (if specified).
Uniquely Military Respiratory Protective Device—A respiratory protection device which is
exempt from the requirements of the OSH Act of 1970 per Executive Order 12196 and 29 CFR
1960.2. In most cases, these devices are not approved by NIOSH and are specifically designed
for use in CBRN environments.
Occupational or Environmental Exposure Limit (OEEL)—The OEEL is the most appropriate

  Employers may select respirators assigned for use in higher workplace concentrations of a
hazardous substance for use at lower concentrations of that substance, or when required
respirator use is independent of concentration.
2
  The assigned protection factors in Table A2.1 are only effective when the employer implements
a continuing, effective respirator program as required by 29 CFR 1910.134, including training,
fit-testing, maintenance, and use requirements.

  This APF category includes filtering facepieces and half-masks with elastomeric facepieces.
4
  The employer must have evidence provided by the respirator manufacturer that testing of these
respirators demonstrates performance at a level of protection of 1,000 or greater to receive an
APF of 1,000. This level of performance can best be demonstrated by performing a WPF or
SWPF study or equivalent testing. Absent such testing, all other PAPRs and SARs with
helmets/hoods are to be treated as loose-fitting facepiece respirators, and receive an APF of 25.
NOTE: These APFs do not apply to respirators used solely for escape. For escape respirators
used in association with specific substances covered by 29 CFR 1910 subpart Z, employers must
refer to the appropriate substance-specific standards in that subpart. Escape respirators for other
Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) atmospheres are specified by 29 CFR
1910.134 (d)(2)(ii).

                   VERBAL COMMUNICATION CONSIDERATIONS

Verbal communication in a noisy industrial environment can be difficult. It is important to
ensure that respirator wearers can comfortably communicate when necessary because a worker
who is speaking very loudly or yelling may cause a facepiece seal leak, and the worker may be
tempted to temporarily dislodge the device to communicate. Both situations are undesirable.
There are several options that may be employed to aid communications when wearing
respirators:
A4.1. Speaking Diaphragms. A speaking diaphragm consists of a resonating surface and
cavity that vibrates during speech, thereby amplifying the wearer's voice outside of the
respirator. Several points must be considered when using speaking diaphragms:
   A4.1.1. There are key components in maintaining the airtight integrity of the facepiece
   requiring care when installing and handling.
   A4.1.2. Use of a respirator having a speaking diaphragm during welding, cutting, burning, or
   grinding operations is of special concern, as flying sparks may burn a hole in the diaphragm,
   thereby creating a leak. Some manufacturers have compensated for these applications by
   providing shrouds to cover the diaphragm or by using metal diaphragms.
   A4.1.3. Not all facepiece respirators are available with speaking diaphragm. Check with the
   equipment manufacturer for availability.
A4.2. Built-in Microphones. Some respirator manufacturers make available small
microphones that are mounted inside or connected to the respiratory inlet covering. The
microphone may be connected to a radio, telephone, loudspeaker, or other means of electronic
transmittal. Two considerations are:
   A4.2.1. Any component that is attached to or through the respiratory inlet covering may
   affect its function. In cases where the manufacturer provides components, strict adherence to
   the installation instructions and leak test procedures is necessary to ensure that the airtight
   integrity is maintained.
   A4.2.2. Voice actuated communication systems may cause continuous sound pickup of the
   blower, when used with powered air-purifying respirators, or air flow noise, when used with
   supplied-air devices.
A4.3. Hand or Coded Signals. A predetermined set of signals may be useful in
communicating.
A4.4. Cranial, Throat, or Ear Microphones. Cranial and throat microphones are held in place
with a harness against the wearer's head and larynx, respectively. Ear microphones are worn in
the same manner as a transistor radio earphone and function as both a microphone and speaker.
Use of these devices does not require making penetrations or attachments to the respirator, and
does not impact the NIOSH certification status. They may be used with radios, telephones,
loudspeakers, or other means of electronic transmittal, similar to facepiece microphones.
Considerations when using these devices are:
 32                                                                   AFI48-137 15 JULY 2014


   A4.4.1. Cranial microphones shall never be placed under the head harness of facepiece
   respirators since their dislodgment may loosen the respirator straps.
   A4.4.2. When connecting wires are passed underneath the bibs or neck seals of supplied-air
   hoods or helmets, they shall be attached to the worker's body to avoid disturbing the bib
   positioning.
A4.5. Use of Telephone Handsets. Since a person exhales while speaking, the exhalation valve
in a facepiece respirator is partially open. This is a perfect location to place a handset or hand-
held microphone to obtain the clearest voice transmission. An alternative is to hold the handset
or microphone to the wearer's throat while speaking.
A4.6. Safety Considerations. Electronic devices shall be selected and used with caution in
explosive atmospheres or Class I hazardous locations identified in Article 501 of the National
Electric Code (NEC). When required, ensure all such devices comply with requirements for
permissibility and intrinsically safe systems according to Article 504 of the NEC. Consider the
effects of radio frequency emissions when utilizing such devices in the vicinity of sensitive
electronic equipment.

             LOW TEMPERATURE ENVIRONMENT CONSIDERATIONS

A5.1. A low temperature environment may cause fogging of the lens in a respiratory inlet
covering and freezing or improper sealing of the valves. Coating the inside surface of the lens
may inhibit fogging at low atmospheric temperatures approaching 0 degrees Celsius (C) (32
degrees Fahrenheit (F)). Full facepieces are available with nose cups that direct the warm and
moist exhaled air through the exhalation valve without contacting the lens. Facepieces with nose
cups may provide satisfactory vision at temperatures as low as -32 degrees C (-25 degrees F).
A5.2. It is important to note that SCBA equipped with a full facepiece and certified for use
below 32 degrees F shall be equipped with a nose cup or other suitable accessory or coating to
maintain the device's NIOSH certification when it is used in environments below 32 degrees F.
A5.3. Additionally, there are several other important considerations that users should be aware
of when using SCBA in a low temperature environment. Users should thoroughly review the
manufacturer's instructions and, if necessary, consult with the manufacturer to become
thoroughly familiar with the precautions and recommendations for use of a specific SCBA in
cold weather conditions.
A5.4. Such general considerations include (in addition to moisture content requirements for air).
   A5.4.1. The checking of all connections that may be affected when exposed to low
   temperatures.
   A5.4.2. The proper storage of elastomeric components such as facepieces and breathing
   tubes that may be prone to distortion if improperly stored in cold weather; such distortion of
   components as facepieces could prevent the user from attaining an adequate fit.
   A5.4.3. The availability of accessories and other components that are specially designed to
   withstand cold temperatures. This includes special elastomeric gaskets and diaphragms that
   are designed to retain their elasticity at low temperatures.
A5.5. At very low atmospheric temperatures, the valves of a respirator may freeze open or
closed due to the presence of moisture.
A5.6. Some air-line respirators are approved with a device called a vortex tube to warm the air
supplied to the respiratory inlet covering of the respirator.
 34                                                                      AFI48-137 15 JULY 2014


                                           Attachment 6
              HIGH TEMPERATURE ENVIRONMENT CONSIDERATIONS

A6.1. Working in a high temperature environment while wearing a respirator creates additional
stress on the wearer. Using a respirator that has a low weight, offers a low resistance to
breathing, possesses a minimal dead air space, and, if feasible, provides a tempering of inlet air
should minimize the additional stress.
A6.2. Dead air volume is the volume of previously exhaled air (which is available to be inhaled)
remaining in a respiratory inlet covering. Reducing the amount of dead air volume in a respirator
reduces the level of carbon dioxide in the inhaled air, which is a major source of respirator usage
related stress. This can be accomplished through the use of powered air purifying respirators,
continuous flow air-line respirators, use of a half face-piece respirator in lieu of a full face-piece,
and use of a nose cup in full face-piece devices (regardless of the mode of operation).
A6.3. Air-line respirators are recommended for use in a high temperature environment. Air-line
respirators approved with a vortex tube will substantially reduce the temperature of the air
supplied to the respirator. If air-purifying respirators are to be used, a half facepiece respirator,
where it offers adequate protection, is preferable to the full facepiece.
A6.4. Elastomeric components of respirators stored in high temperature environments may
deteriorate at an accelerated rate and the facepiece may become permanently distorted. Special
care shall be used to prevent facepiece distortion. Inspection frequency should be established
considering the effects of high temperatures.

                           FACT SHEET FOR CBRN MASK QNFT

Q: What is CBRN mask QNFT?

A: The Air Force has implemented a program to perform “quantitative” fit training for CBRN
protective masks. This program is conducted by the Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight.
The quantitative method determines how well the mask fits the wearer. In the past the Air Force
used subjective qualitative (go/no go) methods to determine if the gas masks fit. QNFT does not
rely on an individual’s smell and taste sensitivity to a test agent. AFI 48-137, Respiratory
Protection Program, outlines the program. QNFT involves measuring the dust concentration in
the atmosphere and inside the mask cavity, and calculating a fit factor (FF). The higher the FF,
the better the fit.

Q: Why do QNFT?

A: The purpose of the CBRN mask QNFT program is to enhance CBRN defense training, help
Air Force personnel maximize their CBRN mask protection, and instill mask confidence. The
CBRN mask QNFT program applies to negative pressure masks designed specifically for use in
a CBRN environment. This program is intended to be a training aide rather than a certification
tool to ensure personnel meet or exceed the minimum target FF.

QNFT increases protection through training personnel to attain an adequate FF by:
(1) Confirming individuals’ mask sizes are correct.
(2) Teaching individuals what their mask feels like when an adequate fit is attained (for example,
head harness tension).
(3) Teaching individuals how to properly don their masks to attain an adequate fit (for example,
sequence of head harness adjustment).

Q: What is the “minimum target” FF?

A: The Air Force selected a FF of 2000 as a division between “adequate” and “poor” fitting gas
masks. The FF indicates how well the mask fits; it is not a protection factor (PF). A PF indicates
the degree to which an adequately fitted mask will reduce the concentration of a contaminant.
For a given contaminant, an adequately fitted mask with a protection factor of 10,000 will reduce
the wearer’s exposure to 1/ 10,000th of the contaminant level outside the mask. The QNFT does
not measure the protection factor. It is also important to realize that the Air Force masks were
not designed to fit 100 percent of the Air Force population; there will be persons who, due to the
size and shape of their heads, will fall outside the design percentiles for the mask. Currently there
is no capability to make custom masks.

Q: What could preclude a valid QNFT?
A1: It could be medical condition or a mask problem.
A2: If an individual reporting for QNFT has an obvious medical condition that might interfere
with a valid evaluation (for example: swelling due to dental surgery; a skin condition; or a
 40                                                                    AFI48-137 15 JULY 2014


shaving waiver), QNFT will be delayed pending a medical evaluation. The evaluation may result
in rescheduling QNFT to a later date or some other medical follow-up.
A3: There could be something physically wrong with the mask (e.g., dirt in exhalation valve).
Q: What can be done to improve fit?

A: The person conducting the fit test will determine if something can be changed to improve the
fit of the mask. This may include modifying donning procedures, or selecting a smaller or larger
mask. All of this is done at the time of the fit test. Most people who do not achieve the minimum
fit factor will be able to achieve it through these simple actions.

Q: What if a person in your unit cannot achieve the minimum target FF?

A: All feasible options (i.e., different sizes of mask, different type of mask, etc.) will be
exhausted to attain the highest FF possible for personnel assigned to or who may deploy to
medium or high threat areas.

Q: When will QNFT be repeated?

A:
(1) Every time a different-sized mask is issued.
(2) When an individual has difficulty with negative pressure self-checks.
(3) When an individual gains or loses 10% or more pounds of body weight based upon their
weight at QNFT.
(4) When an individual has extensive dental work, facial surgery, scarring, or disfigurement.
If a person has questions regarding the need for another QNFT, the person should contact the BE
Flight.
