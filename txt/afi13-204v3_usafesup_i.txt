                                            Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. HQ AFFSA (Air Force Flight Standards Agency) is the USAF‘s executive agent for
terminal area Airfield Operations (AO) matters. As such, HQ AFFSA will work with the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) to resolve AO procedural, training, standardization, and
integration issues, and issue subsequent policies to the Major Commands (MAJCOM).
1.2. Scope and Purpose of this Instruction. This instruction provides guidance on managing
and operating AO facilities and training AO personnel. Within the context of this instruction,
AO is comprised of Air Traffic Control (ATC) and Airfield Management (AM) services. All AO
flight personnel shall refer to this instruction for details regarding the technical aspects of their
responsibilities.
   1.2.1. Operations at Contingency Locations. At contingency locations, the Senior Airfield
   Authority (SAA) or equivalent may authorize deviations to AO procedures outlined in this
   AFI to support tactical or combat operations/situations. Authority must not be delegated. For
   additional supplementary information, refer to AFMAN 13-220, Deployment of Airfield
   Operations.
       1.2.1.1. In the interest of safety to airfield and flight operations, deviations to this AFI
       should be by exception only and include an Operational Risk Management (ORM)
       assessment. Factors to consider for deviations include but are not limited to the length of
       time the operation has been in place and available resources.
       1.2.1.2. If time permits, or at the discretion of the SAA or equivalent, forward proposed
       deviations to the War Fighting Headquarters (WFHQ), Air Operations Center (AOC)
       staff or equivalent for an operational review.
       1.2.1.3. Provide the AOC staff, or equivalent an information copy of approved deviations
       to assist with establishing compliance priorities, providing oversight and developing
       AOR execution activities.
   1.2.2. Contract Locations. This AFI applies to contract locations as specifically outlined in
   the contract Statement of Work (SOW) and/or Performance Work Statement (PWS).
   Locations unable to comply with these criteria due to pre-existing SOWs are exempt until
   such time that the current contract expires.
       1.2.2.1. Locations that exclude this AFI, shall specifically state rationale for the
       exclusion in the SOW.
       1.2.2.2. The MAJCOM Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for AO shall be in the
       coordination process for contract SOWs prior to approval and implementation.
   1.2.3. Overseas Locations. While Host Nation (HN) or international regulations adopted for
   USAF use in overseas areas take precedence, every effort should be made to conform to this
   instruction.
       1.2.3.1. Host regulations and procedures apply to USAF AO personnel who augment a
       civil or foreign ATC or AM facility.
 12                                               AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


      1.2.3.2. MAJCOMs must identify these procedures and international regulations in their
      supplement to this AFI. Refer conflicting procedures to HQ AFFSA prior to
      implementation.
      1.2.3.2. (USAFE) Host Nation (HN) civil and/or Air Force regulations and ICAO
      procedures may apply to USAF controllers throughout the USAFE AOR. Bilateral or
      Technical Agreements at the Department of State, Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC)
      or at wing-level will drive this requirement. The administration and required/recurring
      training for USAF air traffic controllers augmenting HN ATC facilities are outlined in
      Annex 1, 2, 3, and 4. AOF/CCs will adhere to AFI 13-204V3 to the maximum extent
      possible.
   1.2.4. USAF controllers who augment a facility operated by another branch of the US
   military will comply with the ATC regulations and procedures of the host service branch.
   1.2.5. Use of this Instruction, Supplementation, and Application of FAA ATC Directives to
   the USAF. HQ AFFSA sets the policies and procedures for internal AO facility operations.
   MAJCOMs may supplement USAF standards and procedures specified in this instruction
   with prior HQ AFFSA approval. Applicable portions of FAA Order (FAAO) Joint Order
   (JO) 7210.3, Facility Operation and Administration, and FAAO 1900.47B, Air Traffic
   Services Contingency Plan have been incorporated into this instruction.
1.3. Waivers and Recommended Changes.
   1.3.1. Waiver Authority. HQ USAF/A3O and HQ AFFSA are the waiver authorities for this
   instruction. All waivers will be submitted to HQ AFFSA/A3A (hqaffsa.a3a@tinker.af.mil)
   through the appropriate MAJCOM AO OPR for consideration. All waivers pertaining to
   safety of aircraft operations will be forwarded through the MAJCOM A3 to HQ
   AFFSA/A3A for HQ USAF/A3O consideration. Note: Waivers to this instruction will only
   be considered when deemed necessary for completion of assigned flying mission.

   FAA Orders. The FAA requires at least 6 months processing time for all FAA waivers.
      1.3.3.1. For all new waivers to FAA Policy affecting AO, units will submit an AF IMT
      4058 waiver request to their MAJCOM OPR for AO. MAJCOMs OPRs for AO, if in
      concurrence, will work with the requesting unit to establish Safety Risk Management
      Document (SRMD) processing with the applicable Air Force Representative (AFREP).
      Units will submit completed AF IMT 4058 waiver and SRMD requests through the
      MAJCOM OPR for AO for processing and forwarding to HQ AFFSA. Upon HQ
      AFFSA approval to proceed, the AFREP will forward the completed waiver package to
      HQ FAA for processing. The coordinating AFREP will then monitor the waiver process
      and inform the requesting unit, MAJCOM OPR for AO, and HQ AFFSA/A3A of the
      FAA's determination.

                 AIRFIELD OPERATIONS FLIGHT STAFF POSITIONS

2.1. Duty Titles. Duty titles are based on Unit Manpower Document (UMD) authorizations
earned through the Capabilities-Based Manpower Standard. Failure to use authorizations as
described and earned on the UMD could result in reduction of authorizations or removal of
personnel. (Not applicable to ANG and AFRC).
   2.1.1. Request a variance to the manpower standard when additional related
   responsibilities/workload levied on the AOF merit increased manpower authorizations.
2.2. AOF Staff. The typical AOF staff is comprised of an AOF/CC; Airfield Operations Flight
Operations Officer (AOF/DO); Airfield Operations Flight Systems Officer (AOF/SO); Airfield
Manager (AFM); tower/radar facility Chief Controller (CCTLR); NCOIC ATC Training
(NATCT); NCOIC ATC Standardization and Evaluation (NSE); NCOIC, Airfield Automation
Manager (NAAM); Airfield Operations System Specialist (AOSS); Terminal Instrument
Procedures (TERPS) Specialist (if not consolidated at MAJCOM); and/or civilian equivalents.
The AOF/CC will appoint all staff members in writing prior to assuming duties.
   2.2.1. Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC), or civilian equivalent. The
   AOF/CC is the Wing‘s AO focal point, responsible for managing services provided by AOF
   personnel. When more than one 13MX officer is assigned, the senior officer will normally
   be designated the AOF/CC. Additional officers assigned to the AOF will be designated IAW
   paragraph 2.2.2.
       2.2.1.1. ANG and AFRC locations with AM and/or ATC can identify those managers as
       Air Traffic Managers or Airfield Operations Managers.
       2.2.1.2. At locations where only USAF AM exists, the USAF does not provide ATC
       services, and a 13M is not authorized, the senior enlisted 1C7 or civilian equivalent will
       fulfill the responsibilities of the AOF/CC as outlined in this instruction.
   2.2.2. AOF/DO and AOF/SO. The AOF/DO and SO should focus on developing an
   understanding of flight operational and leadership issues, in addition to performing duties
   assigned by the AOF/CC.
2.3. DoD Civilians and Contractors. Note: MAJCOMs will supplement requirements for Host
Nation/Local National personnel filling AO duty positions as required.
   2.3.1. Local Bargaining Unit Agreement. At locations with GS civilian AO personnel
   assigned, managers and supervisors should review the local bargaining unit agreement
   available from Civilian Personnel Office. AFI 36-701, Labor Management Relations,
   contains the USAF procedures and guidance for managers and supervisors when dealing with
   employees represented by an exclusively recognized union. It assigns responsibilities to
   commanders, management officials, supervisors, Civilian Personnel Officers (CPOs), Labor
   Relations Officers (LROs), and Staff Judge Advocates (SJAs).
   2.3.2. DoD and Contract Civilian AM Personnel.
       2.3.2.1. For standardization, DoD and Contract civilian AM personnel will use the
       following duty titles in place of the military unique duty titles (e.g., NCOIC, Deputy, etc.)
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                            17


     throughout this AFI: Airfield Manager (AFM), Assistant Airfield Manager (AAFM),
     Airfield Management Operations Manager (AMOM), Airfield Management Training
     Manager (AMTM) and Airfield Management Shift Lead (AMSL). Qualifications for AM
     civilians are found in AFI 13-204v1, Airfield Operations Career Field Development.
     2.3.2.2. When military staffing warrants, the MAJCOM OPR for AO may approve
     temporary appointments of otherwise qualified GS-2150/54s to AM positions for a period
     not to exceed 180 days in duration. This restriction protects professional development
     opportunities for active duty personnel who require AM management knowledge and
     skills. Note 1: Does not apply to facilities exclusively staffed by DoD civilian
     personnel.
     2.3.2.3. Standard Core Personnel Documents (SCPD) designated for DoD civilian AM
     personnel, GS-2150/54-XX must be used for employment of GS-2150/54 personnel
     assigned to USAF AOF positions. Specific SCPDs are established for DoD civilian AM
     personnel. Minor modifications may be necessary to address locally assigned
     duties/responsibilities. Guidance for developing/modifying CPDs/SCPDs is available on
     the AFPC web site at: http://ask.afpc.randolph.af.mil/ and in AFI 36-1401, Position
     Classification. (Not Applicable to ANG and AFRC)
     2.3.2.4. SCPDs for DoD civilian AM personnel also list Knowledge, Skills, Abilities
     (KSA) required for designated positions. Applicants to GS-2150/54 vacant positions
     must address their expertise in meeting KSA criteria as part of the job application
     process.
     2.3.2.5. DoD civilian AM positions at CONUS locations are designated as Key
     Employees. This designation specifies that vacating the position during war or national
     emergency would seriously impair the mission as the incumbent has unique or scarce
     managerial or technical skills required by the wartime mission. Incumbents must be
     removed from their military recall status if alternatives for filling the position during an
     emergency are unavailable, as specified in AFI 36-507, Mobilization of the Civilian Work
     Force.
  2.3.3. DoD Civilian ATC Personnel.
     2.3.3.1. (Not applicable to ANG) For standardization, DoD civilian ATC personnel
     will use the following duty titles in place of the military unique duty titles (e.g., NCOIC,
     Deputy, etc.) throughout this AFI: Air Traffic Manager (ATM); Controller-in-Charge
     (CIC); Airfield Operations Automation Manager (AOAM); ATC Training Manager
     (ATCTM); or Training and Standardization Manager (TSM). Qualifications for ATC
     civilians are found in AFI 13-204v1.
     2.3.3.2. When military staffing warrants, the MAJCOM OPR for AO may approve
     temporary appointments of otherwise qualified GS-2152s to CCTLR, NATCT, NSE, and
     TSN positions for a period not to exceed 180 days in duration. This restriction protects
     professional development opportunities for active duty personnel who require ATC
     management knowledge and skills. Note 1: Does not apply to facilities exclusively
     staffed by civilian controllers.
     2.3.3.3. Standard Core Personnel Documents (SCPD) designated for ATCS (Terminal),
     GS-2152-XX must be used for employment of GS-2152 personnel assigned to USAF
 18                                                AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


      AOF positions. Specific SCPDs are established for tower, radar, Terminal Instrument
      Procedures (TERPS), or Automation Specialist duties. Minor modifications may be
      necessary to address locally assigned duties/responsibilities. Guidance for

      http://ask.afpc.randolph.af.mil/ and in AFI 36-1401, Position Classification. (Not
      applicable to ANG and AFRC)
      2.3.3.4. SCPDs for ATCS (Terminal) also list (Knowledge, Skills, Abilities) KSA
      required for designated positions. Applicants to GS-2152 vacant positions should be
      required to address their expertise in meeting KSA criteria as part of the job application
      process. GS-2152 personnel must present ATCS and/or Control Tower Operator (CTO)
      certification (as applicable to the ATC facility position being filled) as a condition of hire
      prior to being accepted for employment (Not applicable to ANG).
      2.3.3.5. ATCS (Terminal) GS-2152 positions at CONUS locations are designated as Key
      Employees. This designation specifies that vacating the position during war or national
      emergency would seriously impair the mission as the incumbent has unique or scarce
      managerial or technical skills required by the wartime mission. Incumbents must be
      removed from their military recall status if alternatives for filling the position during an
      emergency are unavailable, as specified in AFI 36-507, Mobilization of the Civilian Work
      Force. (Not applicable to ANG)
2.4. TERPS Specialist. At locations with unit-level TERPS responsibilities, the Operations
Group commander (OG/CC), or equivalent, is responsible for the base TERPS program. The
AOF/CC will appoint a TERPS specialist to manage the local TERPS program.

                           OPERATION OF USAF AIRFIELDS

3.1. Operation of USAF Airfields.
   3.1.1. Controlled Airfields. For the purposes of this instruction, airfields are considered
   controlled when the control tower is open.
   3.1.2. Uncontrolled Airfields. For the purposes of this instruction, airfields are considered
   uncontrolled when the control tower is closed.
      3.1.2.1. MAJCOM/A3s must approve flight operations at uncontrolled USAF airfields.
      Authority may be delegated no lower than the WG/CC. MAJCOM/A3s and/or WG/CCs
      (if delegated) shall address items in Attachment 4 as part of a formal ORM assessment
      before approving flight operations at uncontrolled USAF airfields.
   3.1.3. Operations when ―Essential Services‖ are not available. Operations when essential
   services (Fire/Crash, Medical, Weather, Security, ATC, AM) are not available require
   approval of the MAJCOM/A3 owning AO services. Authority may be delegated no lower
   than the installation WG/CC. WG/CCs shall address items in Attachment 4 as part of a
   formal ORM assessment before approving flight operations when other than required
   essential services are available at USAF airfields and forward to MAJCOM/A3. Requesting
   aircrew require appropriate approval through their parent MAJCOM chain of command.
   3.1.4. Auxiliary Airfields that are owned/contracted or operated by USAF. The services
   available at auxiliary airfields vary according to the flying mission of the owning unit. In
   accordance with paragraphs 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 auxiliary airfields with control towers are
   considered controlled; whereas, those with runway supervisory units only are considered
   uncontrolled. Control tower is defined as a facility with the required equipment and certified
   air traffic controllers. WG/CCs must complete a formal ORM assessment for operations at
   auxiliary fields without the required essential services as described in paragraph 3.1.3 above
   and forward to MAJCOM/A3 for approval.
      3.1.4.1. Compliance with this instruction is required for all USAF owned/operated
      auxiliary airfields. The AFM or designated representative will work with Flight Safety,
      Civil Engineer Squadron (CES), Wing Scheduling and Standardization/Evaluations
      offices to develop an airfield inspection schedule for each active landing auxiliary
      airfield.
      3.1.4.2. At auxiliary airfields, a daily airfield check is required on the active landing
      surfaces prior to starting flying operations.
          3.1.4.2.1. A locally developed checklist/diagram (or electronic equivalents) must be
          used to conduct and document airfield checks. Document and report all discrepancies
          and/or hazards identified during an airfield check for corrective action.
          3.1.4.2.2. Responsibilities for conducting airfield checks may be delegated to non-
          AO personnel (Fire Department, Supervisor of Flying (SOF), Runway Control
          Structure (RCS) personnel, etc.) working on the airfield.
              3.1.4.2.2.1. All non-AO personnel performing an airfield check must be trained
 20                                               AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


               and certified by the AFM or designated representative.
               3.1.4.2.2.2. At a minimum, non-AO personnel must complete the Airfield
               Inspection and Maintenance, and Wildlife Hazard Management CBTs.
       3.1.4.3. A joint airfield inspection will be conducted on a quarterly basis at USAF
       owned/operated auxiliary airfields and should include representatives from AM, ATC,
       Wing Safety, SOF, CES, and Security Forces. The results of this inspection will be
       briefed at the Airfield Operations Board (AOB).
       3.1.4.4. The MAJCOM OPR for AO must identify specific requirements for auxiliary
       airfields in their supplements to this instruction.
   3.1.5. Operation of Aircraft at Air Force Airfields.
       3.1.5.1. Military aero club aircraft are treated as government owned military aircraft for
       liability purposes and for gaining access to military aerodromes. Aircraft privately
       owned by members of a military aero club require authorization to use military facilities
       (see AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, and AFI 10-1002, Agreements for
       Civil Aircraft Use of Air Force Airfields).
       3.1.5.2. Civil aircraft operating at USAF airfields must comply with procedures in AFI
       10-1001, AFI 10-1002, and AFI 10-1003, Use of Air Force Installations for Non-
       Government Business by Civil Air Carriers Participating in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet
       (CRAF) Program.
       3.1.5.3. Foreign government aircraft operating at USAF airfields must comply with
       procedures in AFI 10-1801, Foreign Governmental Aircraft Landings at United States
       Air Force Installations, and have an approved aircraft landing authorization number
       (ALAN) prior to use, except for emergencies.
   3.1.6. Aircrew Violations of Airfield Restrictions. Process a written explanation of the
   incident through the host WG/CC to the WG/CC of the aircrew violating the restriction.
   Provide an informational copy to the host MAJCOM and the MAJCOM owning the aircrew.
3.2. AO Operating Requirements. AO facilities typically operate 16-24 hours per day with
assigned personnel working rotating shifts to support the unit‘s primary flying mission. While
Capabilities-Based Manpower Standard provides core manpower authorizations to support this
flying mission, it does not provide additional manpower for personnel to support unit/base details
and augmentees for base exercises, etc. For this reason, AOF personnel must not be used outside
of their UMD authorized duties and responsibilities unless waived in accordance with AFI 36-
2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).
   3.2.1. Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) Authorization. Facility rated and/or prior
   rated position certified controllers and qualified AM personnel assigned to a rotating shift
   schedule required to perform AO duties are authorized BAS due to assigned duties or
   unusual work hours. Commanders will validate BAS authorization in accordance with
   guidance established in DOD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Chapter 25, DOD Financial
   Management Regulation—Subsistence Allowance.
   3.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Personnel performing duties outside their controlled Air Force
   Specialty Code (AFSC) beyond 130 days during a 12-month period require a waiver IAW
   AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). Track personnel
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                              21


   working outside the facility on the Airfield Operations Board (AOB) minutes with a status of
   the waiver.
3.3. Published Operating Hours. AO facilities remain open to support the base flying mission.
Radar facilities that support the National Airspace System (NAS) may require 24-hour
operations. MAJCOM/A3s establish airfield operating hours. MAJCOM OPR for AO will
publish airfield operating hours in its supplement to this instruction. Units requesting to curtail
hours must comply with paragraph 3.4 The AOF/CC will ensure hours of operation are defined
in the Airfield Operations Instruction (AOI) and published in the appropriate Instrument Flight
Rules (IFR) Supplement. Note: Publish airfield operating hours in FLIP only when less than 24
hours a day, 7 days a week.
   3.3.1. The OG/CC may authorize the use of standby and on-call procedures for AO facilities.
   Outline response time requirements, periodic equipment checks, and notification methods in
   an LOP.
   3.3.1.1. Standby: Time during operating hours when AO personnel are immediately
   available to return the facility to operations within the time limit the OG/CC specifies.
   Consider standby time as ―duty time.‖
   3.3.1.2. On-call: AO personnel must remain in the local area and be able to be contacted in
   the event it becomes necessary to open their respective facility ―outside of normal operating
   hours.‖ Personnel who are on-call must comply with section 7.4 (ATC Restrictions and
   Duty Limitations). Do not consider on-call time as ―duty time.‖
   3.3.2. The OG/CC may extend operating hours at bases where facilities are open less than 24
   hours a day, as required, to meet short-term (no more than 30 days) mission requirements.
   After 30 days, AO staffs must coordinate with MAJCOM AO staff.
3.4. Curtailing AO Services
   3.4.1. ―Open‖ Airfield. Unless NOTAM‘d closed, an airfield is considered ―open‖ during
   published operating hours when all essential services are available.
   3.4.2. ―Closed‖ Airfield. Unless NOTAM‘d otherwise, an airfield is considered closed
   during periods outside of normal published operating hours when essential services are not
   available.
   3.4.3. AO Facility Closures. MAJCOM/A3s approve AO facility closures that result in
   USAF-controlled terminal airspace being permanently or temporarily returned for FAA
   control. This does not apply to requests for holiday closures that are 96 hours or less, which
   is at the discretion of the WG/CC, with FAA supporting facility concurrence.
       3.4.3.1. The overall impact on the supporting FAA facility must be given careful
       consideration when requesting FAA acceptance of terminal airspace, particularly when
       more than one USAF location/MAJCOM requires support from the same FAA Air Route
       Traffic Control Center. Note: The AOF/CC must ensure appropriate NOTAM actions
       are taken.
       3.4.3.2. The AOF/CC shall notify MAJCOM OPR for AO and Regional Air Force
       Representatives (AFREPS) when a proposal to return airspace/curtail operating hours is
       under consideration. This notification shall precede any negotiations outside USAF
 22                                               AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


      channels. To facilitate coordination with HQ FAA, include HQ AFFSA as coordination
      addressees on any proposals submitted to MAJCOM/A3s.
   3.4.4. Airfield Closures. MAJCOM/A3s approve airfield closures in excess of 96 hours.
   Airfield closures of 96 hours or less, such as holiday closures, are at the discretion of the
   WG/CC, through coordination with the FAA if terminal airspace will be impacted.
   3.4.5. Procedures for imposing airfield restrictions and closures.
      3.4.5.1. MAJCOM OPR for AO will establish procedures in their supplements to process
      (e.g., approve or deny) airfield restrictions and closures requests from subordinate bases,
      in addition to airfield restriction dissemination procedures.
          3.4.5.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Prior Permission Required (PPR) restriction authority is
          delegated to the OG/CC. OG/CC may authorize Official Business Only (OBO)
          restrictions that do not exceed six months. OBO restrictions that exceed six months
          must be approved by HQ USAFE/A3/10.
          3.4.5.1.2. (Added-USAFE) OG/CCs will publish a ―projected closure‖ message not
          less than 30 calendar days prior to the projected airfield closure date for programmed
          or planned closures (e.g., construction, etc.) in excess of 72 hours. The message will
          include: reason for closure, anticipated inclusive dates, alternate dates, and initial
          assessment of anticipated impact to wing, base, and tenant operations and other
          known operations (e.g., North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] units, Army
          operations, scheduled AMC movements, etc.). When a closure is anticipated with
          less than 90 days notice, OG/CCs will publish a "projected closure" message at least
          14 days prior to anticipated closure. Note: Due to Chievres AB‘s NATO mission
          requirements, the aforementioned notification process applies to closures in excess of
          96 hours.
          3.4.5.1.3. (Added-USAFE) OG/CCs should utilize Figure 3.1 to coordinate
          planning and final closure dates. As a minimum, contact the agencies listed in Figure
          3.1. Early notification and coordination with tenant units and other airfield users is
          essential.

   1. OG/CC will publish projected closure message.

   2. OG/CC will publish a closure request message to HQ USAFE/A3/10

   3. HQ USAFE/A3CA will submit recommendation for approval or disapproval to HQ USAFE/A3/10.

   4. OG/CC will coordinate final closure dates and planning IAW para 3.4.5.1.3.



         3.4.5.2. Bases will:
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                             25


           3.4.5.2.1. Notify the NAF/A3, host Wing/tenant units and the parent MAJCOM OPR
           for AO airfield restrictions or closures.
           3.4.5.2.2. For approved airfield restrictions or closures that exceed 60 days, send a
           Flight Information Publication (FLIP) change request to Lead Command for
           Aeronautical Publications Standards using the DoD FLIP Revision Report. Include
           pertinent data such as the effective times, dates and the approval authority. Note:
           Lead Command for Aeronautical Publications Standards will not publish FLIP
           changes for airfield restrictions or closures that exist less than 60 days.
           3.4.5.2.3. Enter approved airfield restrictions or closures into the Defense Internet
           Notice To Airmen (NOTAM) Service (DINS) NOTAM system. Develop procedures
           for entering closures or restrictions into the DINS NOTAM system when the decision
           to close or restrict is the responsibility of a civil airport manager at a shared-use
           airfields.
           3.4.5.2.4. If a restriction can be removed before the approved expiration date, send a
           NOTAM canceling the restriction and notify the MAJCOM OPR for AO and host
           Wing/tenant flying units. Notify Lead Command for Aeronautical Publications
           Standards of the change if the restriction was published in the FLIP.
3.5. Extended ATC Facility Closures or Equipment Limitations Affecting Controller
Proficiency. When qualified controllers are unable to perform ATC duties for 30 or more
consecutive days due to airfield closure, facility closure, or equipment limitations the following
conditions will be met.
   3.5.1. The AOF/CC will notify the MAJCOM OPR for AO as soon as possible when a
   facility closure or equipment limitation is expected to exceed 30 or more consecutive days.
   3.5.2. The notification will include a brief description of events, expected length of facility
   closure, and a brief summary of anticipated use of manpower resources.
3.6. Permanently Closing Runways. To permanently close a runway at an active USAF base,
the unit shall:
   3.6.1. Obtain MAJCOM/A3 and HQ USAF/A3O approval unless the USAF has directed the
   action. Provide an information copy to HQ AFFSA.
   3.6.2. Before the effective date of an approved closure:
       3.6.2.1. Notify the AFREP in the affected FAA region.

   data for inclusion in FLIP documents.
3.8. Changes in Flying Mission.
   3.8.1. MAJCOMs approve changes in the AO mission of their units after coordination with
   HQ AFFSA. AO mission changes may involve adjustments in manpower, equipment
   requirements, issues of operational impact, or military interface or services with civil or host
   nation operations. MAJCOMs coordinate changes in approach control services within the
   NAS with the AFREP at the appropriate FAA region.
   3.8.2. When notified of a Mission Design Series (MDS) change, the OG/CC, with AOF/CC
   assistance, must ensure the following actions, as a minimum, are taken prior to the arrival of
   new aircraft:
       3.8.2.1. Ensure all AO personnel are trained on new MDS aircraft characteristics.
       3.8.2.2. Develop simulator and/or static training scenarios for USAF controllers that
       emphasize integration of the new MDS aircraft operations with existing operations.
       3.8.2.3. Develop comprehensive pictorial and written guidance on new MDS, aircraft
       patterns, profiles and procedures.
       3.8.2.4. Review currently published instrument approach and departure procedures to
       ensure they will continue to meet mission requirements. As necessary, develop and
       process new or amended instrument procedures IAW AFI 11-230, Instrument
       Procedures.
       3.8.2.5. Update existing LOPs to include procedures for new MDS aircraft.
       3.8.2.6. Airfield Manager coordinates with base support agencies such as CE, FD, SF,
       SE, Aircraft Maintenance, Fuels Control and Wing Plans to determine if a modification is
       required to aircraft parking plans, taxi routes, and other support facilities (e.g., pavement
       and infrastructure additions, waivers, etc.).
3.9. Notices to Airmen (NOTAM). The AOF/CC identifies a single AO facility, in writing, as
the NOTAM monitor facility. The NOTAM monitor facility coordinates with AM to ensure
appropriate NOTAMs are sent to protect airspace when the control tower will be open outside of
published airfield operating hours, to advise of non-published airfield closures, and to ensure
notification of ATCALS interruptions and malfunctions.
3.10. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Operations.
   3.10.1. Capabilities and Limitations by Group. Table 3.1 identifies specific capabilities and
   limitations associated with current UAS/Remote Piloted Aircraft (RPA). These categorize
   the entire DoD UAS/RPA family in a joint context. Below are some generalities of each
   group.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                        27


     3.10.1.1. Group 1.
        3.10.1.1.1. Capabilities. Group 1 UAS are typically hand-launched, self contained,
        portable systems employed at the small unit level or for base security. They are
        capable of providing ―over the hill‖ or ―around the corner‖ type reconnaissance and
        surveillance. Payloads are generally fixed electro-optical infrared (EO/IR), and they
        have a negligible logistics footprint.
        3.10.1.1.2. Limitations. Group 1 UAS typically operate within the operator‘s line of
        sight (LOS) at low altitudes, generally less than 1200 feet AGL and have a limited
        local endurance.
     3.10.1.2. Group 2.
        3.10.1.2.1. Capabilities. Group 2 UAS are typically medium-sized, catapult-
        launched, mobile systems that usually support brigade and below intelligence,
        surveillance and reconnaissance/reconnaissance surveillance and target acquisition
        (ISR/RSTA) requirements. These systems operate at altitudes less than 3500 feet
        AGL with a local to medium range. They usually operate from unimproved areas and
        do not usually require an improved runway. Payloads may include a sensor ball with
        EO/IR and a laser range-finder/designator (LRF/D) capability. They usually have a
        small logistics footprint.
        3.10.1.2.2. Limitations. They may also have limited range and endurance.
     3.10.1.3. Group 3.
        3.10.1.3.1. Capabilities. Group 3 UAS are larger systems than Group 1/2 UAS.
        They operate at medium altitudes and usually have medium to long range/endurance.
        Their payloads may include a sensor ball with EO/IR, LRF/D, synthetic aperture
        radar (SAR), moving target indicator, signals intelligence (SIGINT), communications
        relay, and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high-yield explosives
        (CBRNE) detection. Some systems may be weaponized. They usually operate from
        unimproved areas and may not require an improved runway.
        3.10.1.3.2. Limitations. Group 3 UAS typically have decreased endurance when
        carrying weapons. The logistics footprint typically includes ground support
        equipment.
     3.10.1.4. Group 4.
        3.10.1.4.1. Capabilities. Group 4 UAS/RPA are relatively large systems, operate at
        medium to high altitudes, and have extended range/endurance. Group 4 payloads
        may include EO/IR, radars, lasers, communications relay, SIGINT, automatic
        identification system (AIS), and weapons.
        3.10.1.4.2. Limitations. Group 4 RPA typically have decreased endurance when
        carrying weapons. Fixed-wing RPA normally require improved areas for launch and
        recovery (e.g., runway). Group 4 UAS/RPA logistics footprint may approach that of
        manned aircraft of similar size. Group 4 UAS/RPA typically have robust airspace
        operations requirements. For those Group 4 UAS/RPA that typically operate beyond
        line of sight (BLOS), lack of satellite communications (SATCOM) could force LOS
        operations.

      3.10.1.5. Group 5.
            3.10.1.5.1. Capabilities. Group 5 UAS/RPA are typically the largest systems,
            operate in the medium to high altitude environment, and typically have the greatest
            range/endurance and airspeed. They perform specialized missions including broad
            area surveillance and penetrating attacks. Group 5 payloads may include EO/IR,
            radars, lasers, communications relay, SIGINT, AIS, and weapons.
            3.10.1.5.2. Limitations. Group 5 RPA require improved areas for launch and
            recovery. The logistics footprint may approach that of manned aircraft of similar
            size. Group 5 UAS/RPA typically have the most stringent airspace operations
            requirements. For those Group 5 UAS/RPA that typically operate BLOS, lack of
            SATCOM could force LOS operations.

   3.10.2. UAS Airfield Operations.
      3.10.2.1. Specific procedures for local UAS operations must be published in the AOI and
      any other appropriate LOPs. Address the procedures listed, proposal, as well as site
      specific procedures/data, NOTAM requirements, emergency recall of airspace or required
      landing of UAS, altitude caps, and other issues specific to base flying operations.
      3.10.2.2. The safety of manned aircraft will take precedence over unmanned aircraft in
      an emergency situation.
      3.10.2.3. To the maximum extent possible, AO personnel will handle Group 4 and 5
      RPA operations in the same manner as manned flights. Group 1, 2, and 3 UAS will
      generally have segregated airspace assigned to operate in that does not conflict with the
      normal flow of air and ground traffic.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                         29


     3.10.2.4. UAS/RPA Pilot/Operator AO Familiarization. When providing local AO
     orientation training to UAS/RPA pilots/operators, consider the UAS/RPA pilot/operator
     qualifications when deciding on the length of training required. Note: Group 4 and 5
     RPA pilots/operators will generally be rated pilots and have a greater understanding of
     AO procedures compared to Group 1, 2, and 3 UAS pilots/operators.
     3.10.2.5. Locations that support UAS operations must publish a FLIP advisory to that
     effect. Note: Example FLIP entry – ―Use extreme caution for extensive UAS ops in the
     vicinity.‖
     3.10.2.6. Airfield Markings and Signage. All changes to airfield signage/markings along
     established UAS taxi routes will be coordinated with UAS Ops prior to changes being
     made.
     3.10.2.7. Flight Planning. Flight Plans (DD175, Military Flight Plan and 1801, DoD
     International Flight Plan) will be filed for UAS flights, as applicable. Note 1: UAS
     designations in the ―Aircraft Type‖ section of DD175 and 1801 flight plans are not
     recognized by the ARTCC host computer. Therefore, include the UAS designation in the
     remarks section of all IFR flight plans. For additional guidance see the General Planning
     Guide.
     3.10.2.8. Emergency Divert Base Designation. If designated as an Emergency Divert
     Base for UAS, AOF/CC will include all such procedures in the AOI.
        3.10.2.8.1. Notify MAJCOM OPR for AO if contacted to be an Emergency Divert
        Base.
        3.10.2.8.2. Include procedures to notify the respective Operations Center of any/all
        changes in airfield status.
     3.10.2.8.3.   Include towing procedures and coordination.
     3.10.2.9. UAS pilots/operators will pre-coordinate all UAS missions with AO unless
     addressed in an LOP.
        3.10.2.9.1. UAS mission commanders, pilots, or SOFs will advise ATC of initiation
        and completion of flight operations.
     3.10.2.10. Disaster Relief Operations. The FAA issued a waiver allowing the
     NORTHCOM Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) to operate UASs in
     direct support of disaster relief operations. The Certificate of Authorization (COA) for
     UAS surveillance support above the geographic dimensions of a Disaster Relief
     Temporary Flight Restriction must be issued by the FAA IAW 14 CFR 91.137.
     3.10.2.11. Contingency Operations. Establish procedures in accordance with published
     Special Instructions (SPINs).
        3.10.2.11.1. Crash grid map should be used to develop flight sectors for UASs.
        However, until a crash grid map is available, utilize the best data available for the
        contingency location. Additionally, traditional approach/departure corridors may not
        be used in a tactical environment.
     3.10.2.12. Radio check between UAS/RPA pilot/operator and ATC will be conducted
     prior to operations.
30                                             AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


        3.10.2.12.1. All communications between ATC and UAS/RPA pilot/operator will be
        accomplished on designated primary and/or alternate ATC frequencies.
        Secondary/backup communications and/or telephone connectivity will be pre-
        coordinated.
  3.10.3. AM Procedures.
     3.10.3.1. AM will pass all airfield status changes to UAS Ops in a timely manner.
     3.10.3.2. UAS Bed Down.
        3.10.3.2.1. Coordinate with CE, Safety (SE), and TERPS to ensure that UAS bed
        down locations, including shelters/hangars and communication towers are sited IAW
        with UFC 03-260-01 and TERPs criteria.
        3.10.3.2.2. FOD Prevention. Coordinate with UAS/RPA unit(s) to incorporate
        established UAS/RPA taxi routes into the airfield sweeping schedule/plan as required.
        3.10.3.2.3. Live Ordinance. Coordinate with CE, SE, Security Forces (SF), Transient
        Alert (TA), Maintenance Operations Control Center (MOCC), and flying units to
        designate areas for loading, unloading, arming and de-arming UAS. Note: For
        airfields that do not have designated areas for loading, unloading, arming and de-
        arming, refer to paragraph 15.1.1.3.39
     3.10.3.3. Airfield Driving. All UAS support personnel that need to drive on the airfield
     must receive Airfield Drivers Training. Additionally, the Airfield Manager will
     incorporate UAS familiarization training into the Airfield Drivers Training Program.
     Note: Some UAS require special launch and recovery operations. Coordinate with ATC
     and UAS Ops to establish procedures for ―chase‖ vehicles entering the Controlled
     Movement Area (CMA)/runway to conduct launch and recovery activities. Include these
     procedures in the local AOI.
     3.10.3.4. Arresting Gear Configuration. Due to the risk of damaging fragile landing
     gear, UAS cannot taxi over arresting gear in the raised position. At locations where
     arresting gear is installed, establish procedures for arresting cable re-configuration to
     allow for UAS launch and recovery operations.
  3.10.4. ATC Procedures.
     3.10.4.1. Describe UAS/RPA to other aircraft by stating ―unmanned aircraft/unmanned
     (TYPE).‖
     3.10.4.2. Aircraft Category: For the purpose of ATC separation and sequencing, classify
     UAS as ―Category III‖, subject to change dependant on the COA or appropriate
     guidance.
     3.10.4.3. Prior to commencing and at the conclusion of UAS operations, ATC facilities
     shall advise adjacent approach control facilities that UAS operations are being conducted
     or terminated.
     3.10.4.4. Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) procedures. The ATIS must
     be updated to reflect when UAS operations are conducted and when they terminate.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                          31


        3.10.4.4.1. Include in the ATIS broadcast remarks that "unmanned aircraft operations
        are in progress.‖ This advisory is required once a UAS requests to taxi or launch, and
        15 minutes prior to its estimated time of arrival, if operating outside of the terminal
        airspace.
        3.10.4.4.2. Terminate advisory when UAS operations are complete; UAS is not
        returning for over one hour, or when the UAS lands, exits the runway, and no longer
        poses a potential impact to taxi operations.
     3.10.4.5. Separation and Sequencing.
        3.10.4.5.1. UAS cannot be instructed to follow another aircraft or UAS.
        3.10.4.5.2. Visual Separation. Use of visual separation between UAS and manned
        aircraft or UAS and UAS is not authorized. This does not restrict the tower
        controller's ability to visually separate aircraft.
        3.10.4.5.3. Special Visual Flight Rules (SVFR) is not authorized with UAS.
        3.10.4.5.4. Simultaneous Same Direction. All UAS will be treated as ―All others‖ in
        accordance with FAAO JO 7110.65.
        3.10.4.5.5. Preventative Control. May only be applied in accordance with FAAO JO
        7110.65.
        3.10.4.5.6. Issue cautionary wake turbulence advisories, and the position, altitude,
        and direction of flight to landing UAS/RPA pilot/operator, if in your opinion, wake
        turbulence may have an adverse effect on it.
            3.10.4.5.6.1. Wake turbulence rules cannot be waived by the UAS/RPA
            pilot/operator.
     3.10.4.6. During UAS lost link, the control tower may activate the Primary Crash
     Activation System (PCAS). However, it may not require the same level of rescue
     services provided for normal emergencies. Specify local procedures detailing the
     required rescue services for UAS lost link emergencies.
        3.10.4.6.1. If lost link occurs, UAS/RPA pilot/operator will immediately notify ATC
        with the following information, if applicable:
            3.10.4.6.1.1. Time of lost link.
            3.10.4.6.1.2. Last known position.
            3.10.4.6.1.3. Altitude.
            3.10.4.6.1.4. The direction of flight.
            3.10.4.6.1.5. Confirm execution of lost link procedures.
            3.10.4.6.1.6. Confirm pilot/observer has visual contact with UAS/RPA.
        3.10.4.6.2. In the event of lost link, lost communication between UAS/RPA
        pilot/operator and ATC or lost communication between UAS/RPA pilot/operator and
        observer, ATC will do the following, if applicable:
            3.10.4.6.2.1. Cease aircraft launches until status of affected UAS is determined.
 32                                               AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


              3.10.4.6.2.2. Recover other UAS as appropriate.
              3.10.4.6.2.3. Issue advisories and ATC instructions as appropriate to ensure safe
              operations for all aircraft.
              3.10.4.6.2.4. Sterilize predetermined UA Zone.
       3.10.4.7. NORDO Operations. ATC will:
          3.10.4.7.1. Notify UAS/RPA pilot/operator of any known NORDO aircraft.
          3.10.4.7.2. UAS/RPA pilot/operator, assisted by ATC, will determine the best
          method to separate UAS/RPA and NORDO aircraft. Examples of separation

                    AO FLIGHT MANAGEMENT AND PROGRAMS

4.1. Local Operating Procedures (LOPs). All regulatory guidance describing local AO
services must be published in an LOP such as a LOA, Operations Letter (OL), flight or facility
Operating Instruction (OI), or Operations Plan (OPLAN). LOPs may be internal to the flight or a
specific facility, between two or more base agencies, or between Wing agencies and external
agencies such as the FAA or another operational wing. Note 1: Changes to existing LOA‘s,
MOU‘s, and facility OI‘s must be converted to or integrated into the applicable LOP within 180
days after the date of the memorandum or the guidance will no longer be in effect.
   4.1.1. Approval Authority and Functional Review. The level of signature depends on the
   type of LOP being written or negotiated. The senior operational commander for the
   signatory agencies should approve and sign for their organization.
       4.1.1.1. MAJCOM OPR for AO must complete a functional review of all LOPs directing
       AO services prior to implementation. LOPs that are administrative in nature do not
       require functional review. AOF/CCs will send the LOP with the appropriate attachment
       from this instruction prior to submitting the final draft to the approval authority for
       signature.
       4.1.1.1. (USAFE) Units shall electronically submit draft letter of procedures (LOPs) to
       HQ USAFE/A3CA, usafe.a3ca@ramstein.af.mil. LOPs shall not be effective prior to
       the MAJCOM approval date. Joint/host-nation LOPs that govern AO should be
       forwarded to HQ USAFE for review and to obtain approval letters. The review might
       occur after the HN has implemented the LOP; however, the unit is still required to
       forward LOPs to HQ USAFE/A3CA.
       4.1.1.2. LOPs that address AO services, training, and/or operations with host nation
       agencies must be approved by the MAJCOM OPR for AO prior to implementation. This
       review ensures that such LOPs are in compliance with federal, USAF, MAJCOM, and
       host nation policies. When forwarding LOPs for approval, attach a cover letter that
       describes the purpose/background and/or rationale for changes. Note 1: Affected
       MAJCOMs must establish procedures in their supplement to this instruction on how this
       process will be conducted. Additional guidance is provided in AFI 51-701, Negotiating,
       Concluding, Reporting, and Maintaining International Agreements.
       4.1.1.2. (USAFE) Units forwarding LOPs that require HN approval shall also forward a
       copy of any applicable Technical Agreement, bilateral agreement, or other HN
       requirements when forwarding LOPs to HQ USAFE/A3CA for approval and/or review.
       HQ USAFE/A3CA has approval authority at contingency locations.
          4.1.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The servicing installation staff judge advocate (SJA)
          reviews all draft AO agreements between the USAF and the HN (including
          government agencies, military forces and civil or international organizations). Units
          shall route the agreement to the servicing SJA and to HQ USAFE A5/A8/A9
          (International Agreements), who will review the agreement to determine if the
          agreement is an administrative agreement and not a reportable agreement for
          purposes of the Case Act and its implementing regulations (AFI 51-701, USAFEI 51-
34                                               AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


        701, DoD Directive 5530). If the agreement is concluded to be administrative, then a
        letter of non-applicability should be requested from HQ USAFE A5/A8/A9. If HQ
        USAFE A5/A8/A9 concludes the agreement is an international agreement, the
        document must be processed according to AFI 51-701, Negotiating, Concluding,
        Reporting and Maintaining International Agreements.
  4.1.2. Standard LOPs.
     4.1.2.1. Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI). The ADI is a stand-alone document that
     establishes a base‘s Airfield Driving Program. The Senior Operational Commander is the
     local signatory for the ADI, and the MAJCOM OPR for AO is the final approval
     authority for the ADI. Requirements for the ADI will be available in AFI 13-213,
     Airfield Driving.
     4.1.2.1. (USAFE) All wing ADPMs will utilize the Airfield Driving Training Program
     located at https://private.amc.af.mil/ADTP/Login.aspx.
     4.1.2.2. Airfield Operating Instruction (AOI). The AOI provides guidance regarding
     airfield and terminal environment activities which directly affect flying operations. It is
     the primary source document for describing local ATC, airfield, and flying operations
     applicable to base assigned aircrews, such as Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and radar traffic
     patterns, In-Flight Emergency (IFE) response procedures, local aircraft priorities, etc.
     Guidance on format and content of AOIs is provided in, Attachment 2. The Senior
     Operational Commander is the local signatory for the AOI, and the MAJCOM OPR for
     AO is the approval authority. Note: MDS-specific instructions may direct information
     required in the AOI to also be published in a local 11-series instruction. AOF/CCs must
     work with flying standardization and evaluation offices to minimize duplication and
     ensure published procedures do not conflict.
     4.1.2.3. Training OIs (TOIs) must be developed by the AM and ATC training personnel
     to establish policy and procedures for implementing and defining AM and ATC training
     program responsibilities. The TOIs must expand those areas where further explanation is
     required and standardize local training procedures. Each unit must develop, implement,
     and administer each program in accordance with this instruction, AFI 36-2201, Air Force
     Training Program, and AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional System Development. The TOIs
     should not restate training requirements, procedures, or responsibilities already published.
     Requirements for the ATC and AM TOIs can be found in Chapter 13 and Chapter 19,
     respectively. The MAJCOM OPR for AO is the approval authority for TOIs.
     4.1.2.4. Flight or Facility OIs are established to regulate and standardize operational and
     administrative practices. Operational OIs are approved by the MAJCOM OPR for AO
     and administrative OIs are approved by the AOF/CC or respective facility managers.
     4.1.2.5. LOAs are established between USAF units or agencies on a particular base and a
     non-USAF agency from the base or any unit or agency from another location. Routinely,
     LOAs are established between a supported wing and an FAA Terminal Radar Approach
     Control (TRACON) or FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). Guidance on
     format and content of LOAs is provided by FAAO JO 7210.3. LOAs with the FAA
     should be coordinated with the Air Traffic Representative (ATREP) assigned as liaison
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                           35


       with the USAF facilities involved and reviewed by the AFREP at the Service Area office.
       The MAJCOM OPR for AO is the approval authority for LOAs.
       4.1.2.6. OPLANs provide guidance for contingency/wartime operations.             When
       applicable, AO tasks are addressed in the OPLAN annex. Guidance on format and
       content of OPLANs is contained in AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and
       Execution. OPLANS are normally managed by the Wing plans office though the AOF
       may be appointed as the OPR for certain OPLANS pertaining to airfield operations, e.g.
       snow removal or stop alert plan. The AOF/CC will review all OPLANs for AO tasks
       and prepare a plans brief that includes all AO tasks in that OPLAN. The plans brief will
       be submitted to the MAJCOM OPR for AO for review unless the AOF/CC is the
       designated OPR for the entire plan. The WG/CC is the approval authority for OPLANS.
       4.1.2.6. (USAFE) All plans, briefs or extracts submitted to HQ USAFE/A3CA will be
       in the format provided in Attachment 2 of this supplement.
       4.1.2.7. Operations letters are established between AO facilities or between an AO
       facility and another base agency to supplement operational or procedural instructions and
       to standardize operations. Operations letters describe special operating conditions or AO
       procedures that are unique to certain locations. The AOF/CC shall ensure operations
       letters are established covering tower/radar coordination procedures and ATCALS
       restoral and maintenance procedures. The MAJCOM OPR for AO is the approval
       authority for operations letters between AO facilities and operations letters between AO
       facilities and other base agencies.
   4.1.3. Implementing and Maintaining LOPs.
       4.1.3.1. Upon obtaining the appropriate level of approval for an LOP, incorporate any
       required revisions and prepare the LOP in final form. Establish an effective date that
       allows a minimum of 30 days for familiarization for all affected agencies and pre-
       implementation actions after finalized agreement is signed. Distribute copies of the
       signed LOP to all affected agencies or post to the appropriate website.
       4.1.3.2. Within 30 days of implementing a new LOP, the AOF/CC will upload the LOP
       and current index to the MAJCOM CoP/EIM. The AOF/CC must also remove the
       superseded version of the LOP from the CoP.
       4.1.3.3. LOPs must be reviewed by the AOF/CC annually and updated as appropriate.
       The AOF/CC shall maintain a comprehensive library of all current applicable LOPs and
       indexes in the ATC facilities and AM Ops that are available to all AOF personnel. The
       index must include the subject/title, effective date of each LOP, MAJCOM approval date,
       and date of annual review.
4.2. Airfield Operations Board (AOB). This board provides a forum for discussing, updating,
and tracking various activities associated with support of the flying mission. The AOB will
convene quarterly.
   4.2.1. The board is chaired by the Wing CV or designated representative. (Not to be

   applicable to each location).
4.4. AO Manning. AOF/CCs must closely monitor AO facility manning levels to ensure
uninterrupted services are provided to support the flying mission. When AO facility staffing
levels are forecasted to drop (assigned/qualified/usable manning) and have the potential to
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                               37


impact the local flying mission, the AOF/CC or OSS/CC shall take the following actions to
mitigate its impact after discussing with senior leadership (OG/CC or WG/CC).
   4.4.1. Return medically qualified personnel assigned to other base/organizational duties
   (such as first sergeant or chief enlisted manager) to AO facilities.
   4.4.2. Curtail all additional duties, e.g. unit/organizational additional duties.
   4.4.3. Exempt personnel from local exercise taskings not involving AO services, e.g. facility
   evacuations, facility security guards, and damage assessment.
   4.4.4. During known periods of low traffic density, combine ATC positions to reduce the
   number of controllers on shifts to afford adequate controller staffing during peak flying
   periods.
   4.4.5. During periods of low flying activity, pursue a waiver to the AM shift-staffing
   requirement.
   4.4.6. Use a senior controller concept where possible for all ATC facilities during periods of
   non-peak flying.
   4.4.7. Reduce ATC seven-skill level staffing to one per shift, unless a variance requires
   additional requirements.
   4.4.8. Extend the ATC duty day to 10-hour shifts and/or six/one duty day rotation schedule
   and/or reduce the Wing flying schedule, commensurate with available ATC staffing. Extend
   the AM duty day to 12-hour shifts and/or six/one duty schedule. Note: To facilitate shift
   rotations and crew rest requirements, this activity should be forecasted at least 2 weeks in
   advance.
   4.4.9. Utilize dual-certified personnel from other facilities, the facility chief controller, and
   all other personnel who hold certifications to work in the affected facility.
   4.4.10. Cancel leaves, PME attendance, and non-essential TDYs.
   4.4.11. AO personnel performing duties outside their controlled Air Force Specialty Code
   (AFSC) beyond 130 days during a 12 month period require a waiver to AFI 36-2101,
   Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). Track personnel working outside the
   facility, until return, on the AOB minutes, along with a status of the waiver.
4.5. Critical Manning Options. When a facility reaches critical manning, the following
additional actions should be taken to mitigate the impact on flying operations. These actions
require the involvement and support of base leadership from the AOF/CC to the WG/CC,
MAJCOM, and the FAA regional AFREP when support of adjacent FAA facilities is required.
MAJCOM AO staffs must ensure the AFREP is advised of critical manning issues that may
require FAA support in their respective region.

4.6. Actions Following an Aircraft Mishap. Do not disclose information related to aircraft
mishaps/incidents except as outlined below.
   4.6.1. The AOF/CC shall coordinate on and off base mishap notification procedures to
   ensure appropriate base agencies/senior leadership are notified of a mishap in a timely
   manner. To ensure ATC facilities are appropriately focused on mishap response activities
   and control of aircraft, only notification procedures directly associated with timely relay of
   data and mishap response activities should be delegated to controllers in the ATC facilities.
   4.6.2. CCTLRs will develop a facility mishap notification checklist to provide mishap
   response guidance to controllers on duty. The ATC Watch Supervisor (WS) or Senior
   Controller (SC) initiates the checklist and ensures completion of the mishap notification
   checklist. Facility checklists should contain procedures for accomplishing the following
   items as a minimum:
      4.6.2.1. Notify the CCTLR and/or AOF/CC that a mishap has occurred.
      4.6.2.2. Coordinate facility and runway status with other ATC agencies.
      4.6.2.3. Request an aircraft mishap local (SPECIAL) weather observation at non-
      automated locations or when automated systems are operating in back-up mode
      4.6.2.4. As directed, provide airspace sterilization over crash site.
      4.6.2.5. Notify ATCALS maintenance to check equipment performance, if USAF
      ATCALS were involved.
      4.6.2.6. Initiate NOTAMs, as required.

      strips, and weather data. As soon as feasible, remove, label, store, and safeguard pertinent
      digitally recorded data, cassettes, and/or discs. Notify responsible TERPS authority so
      that all files contained within the Instrument Procedures Package and any other
      documentation associated with the incident instrument procedure in use at the time can be
      preserved.
      4.6.2.8. Manning permitting, provide position relief to controllers who were on duty at
      the time of the mishap. The WS/SC determines the optimal time for position relief, giving
      consideration to continuity of services for mishap response support and human factors
      impact on controllers on duty at the time of mishap. If the WS/SC suspects a controller
      may have contributed to the mishap, the controller must be relieved from position
      immediately.
   4.6.3. As soon as possible after being notified of an aircraft mishap, the AOF/CC or CCTLR
   will assess controller involvement. If the AOF/CC or CCTLR suspects a controller‘s
   performance contributed to a mishap:

     alignment. Note: Not applicable to DTAS sites.
     4.6.5.2. ATCALS maintenance must perform an immediate and comprehensive ground
     check of equipment that remains in operation. Since ATCALS maintenance can only
     validate signals at ground level, a local flyability check should also be conducted to
     ensure appropriate airborne signal reception.
     4.6.5.3. If equipment performance remains suspect, the AOF/CC shall ensure that the
     facility is taken out of service and request an official post-accident flight inspection.
     Return the facility to service, when it is suspected of contributing to a mishap incident,
     only after a successful FAA flight inspection.
  4.6.6. Establish procedures to ensure AOF personnel do not release the names of individuals
  allegedly involved in an aircraft incident or accident to agencies outside USAF channels.
  Procedures should ensure personnel do not discuss the accident/incident beyond what is
  necessary to accomplish duties via the crash phone. All inquiries from non-mishap response
  personnel must be directed to Public Affairs.
  4.6.7. The AOF/CC shall notify their MAJCOM AO staff of any mishap involving AOF
  services as soon as feasible without impacting emergency response activities. MAJCOM AO
  staffs will coordinate with MAJCOM safety counterparts to ensure appropriate AM and ATC
  representation is afforded to the mishap Safety Investigation Board (SIB), as required in
  AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports. When the command
  responsible for the mishap investigation differs from the command providing host base
  oversight, ATC/AM representation should be provided by the command with host base
  oversight.
     4.6.7.1. (Added-USAFE) Initial notification can be in the form of a phone call or e-mail
     to HQ USAFE/A3CA at usafe.a3ca@ramstein.af.mil. If the event occurs outside of
     normal operating hours and is of a serious nature (i.e., loss of life or significant damage
     of property), contact the HQ USAFE Command Center, Defense Switched Network
     (DSN) 480-8200, and request to have them contact HQ USAFE/A3CA personnel. All e-

   support safety or accident investigations with airfield operations functional experts.
   4.7.2. All HQ AFFSA or MAJCOM AO staff personnel participating in aircraft accident
   investigations must complete the Aircraft Mishap Investigation Course (AMIC).
4.8. Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations.
   4.8.1. NVDs must not be used for providing separation services. NVDs are intended to
   enhance situational awareness only. Procedures for NVD use by AO personnel or blacked-
   out airfield operations must be published in the AOI and/or other appropriate LOP. For
   guidance on ATC and AM NVD equipment use, refer to Chapter 11 and Chapter 19
   respectively. As a minimum, the following areas must be addressed:
      4.8.1.1. Scheduling procedures.

                  RECORDS MANAGEMENT, INQUIRIES, AND DATA

5.1. Recorded Records. The AOF/CC is the custodian of all recorded records in all USAF AO
facilities.
   5.1.1. Retain all voice recorder tapes/cassettes and data extraction disc recordings for 45
   days, or IAW guidance in Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS),
   AF Records Disposition Schedule, Table 13-06, Rule 02.00, whichever is greater.
   5.1.2. At facilities where the ATC automation system has the ability to record operations on
   the system, retain all electronically recorded media (e.g., Continuous Data Recording (CDR),
   Digital Audio Tapes (DAT), Digital Audio Legal Recorder (DALR), etc.) for 45 days, or
   IAW guidance in Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS), AF
   Records Disposition Schedule, Table 13-06, Rule 02.00, whichever is greater.
   5.1.3. Radar Audio Playback Terminal Operations Recording (RAPTOR) or other CDR data
   playback/data analysis tools may be used in the investigation of an incident, suspected
   separation loss, pilot deviation, controller error, TCAS event, miscellaneous incident, or
   accident. Note: RAPTOR is a stand-alone software program that ―decodes‖ data recorded
   on STARS CDR tapes and then makes that data available for playback on a standard desktop
   computer.
       5.1.3.1. CDR data reductions, including RAPTOR, are time consuming activities;
       therefore their retrieval should be limited to those times deemed absolutely necessary, as
       determined by the AOF/CC.
       5.1.3.2. Copies of CDR data analyses, RAPTOR playbacks/files, and RAPTOR software
       are releasable, but only at the discretion of the AOF/CC.
       5.1.3.3. RAPTOR file/playback release procedures. For multiple sensor systems,
       identify the sensor in use or filter all but the primary sensor in use. In addition, identify
       and/or provide an electronic copy of the RAPTOR radar map most likely in use during
       the event.
5.2. Retaining Mishap Records. AOF/CCs file and maintain official copies of written and
recorded records pertinent to an alleged flying deviation, Military Flying Deviation (MFD) or
Hazardous Air Traffic Reports (HATRs) for six months. File and maintain copies of written and
recorded records about aircraft mishaps or accidents for two years, or on deactivation of the unit
(if sooner), according to USAF records disposition schedule (Table 91-5, rule 3) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. This file may contain the originals or
certified copies. In addition, keep other data such as crew duty schedules, controller training
records, AF IMT 1042, Medical Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational Duty,
medical waivers/profiles, etc., used in the investigation that the government might require to
defend ATC in law suit actions. This file should contain only factual data that is generated in the
ordinary course of business; it should not contain un-sworn controller statements, summaries of
events, opinions and recommendations, or privileged safety information.
   5.2.1. CDR data of automated radar systems may be used in the investigation of reported
   incidents believed to be operational errors/deviations to determine the amount of separation
 44                                                 AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


   that existed or position of the aircraft. CDR data may not be used as the primary source for
   reporting an incident or commencing an investigation. When CDR data is used in this
   capacity, the automated system clock shall be verified as being accurate at the time of the
   incident.
       5.2.1.1. Protect CDR media, CDR hard-copy printouts and all other recorded records of
       aircraft mishaps, alleged deviations or Hazardous Air Traffic Reports (HATR) to the
       degree necessary to prevent unauthorized access. Locked receptacles (file cabinets, desks
       or safes) are adequate for storing this material.
5.3. Releasing Aircraft Mishap/Incident Related Information. Persons conducting an
official safety investigation of a USAF mishap have access to all factual and non-factual
information pertinent to an aircraft mishap. These individuals may interview or request
statements/testimony from personnel who were controlling air traffic at the time of the mishap or
who observed the mishap incident. These interviews, statements and testimony are not protected
from public release in all cases. See specific guidance below and in the governing AFIs for the
type investigations that are associated with aircraft mishaps and what information is protected.
   5.3.1. AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety
   Investigations and Reports, govern the SIB process. The SIB is chartered solely for mishap
   prevention; to find causes of mishaps in order to take preventive actions.
       5.3.1.1. The SIB produces a two-part report. Part I of the report contains non-privileged
       factual information that may be disclosed outside the USAF in accordance with the
       Freedom of Information Act. If requested and available, CDR data may be included in
       Part I, Tab M.         Transcripts of recorded air-to-ground and aircraft-to-aircraft
       communications are included in Part I, Tab N. Part II contains the privileged information
       that will not be disclosed. Investigation, Analysis, Findings, and Recommendations;
       Statements and Testimony of Witnesses and Persons Involved; and Statements of Persons
       Cited in Finding (respectively) are included in Part II, Tabs T, U, and V.
       5.3.1.2. Distribution of privileged reports is restricted to those with a need to know and
       must be protected for inter-base email transmission. Refer to AFI 91-204, Chapter 3, for
       guidance on protecting privileged information.
       5.3.1.3. Privileged information contained in Part II of the SIB report may not be used as
       evidence for punitive, disciplinary or adverse administrative actions, for determining the
       misconduct or line-of-duty status of any person, in flying evaluation board hearings or
       reviews, to determine liability or liability in claims for or against the United States, or in
       any other manner in any action by or against the United States. The intent of this
       protection is to encourage open communication without fear of retribution, in order to
       expedite the discovery of causal factors and prevent future incidents.
   5.3.2. AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations, governs the Accident Investigation
   Board process. An AIB conducts a legal investigation to inquire into the facts surrounding
   Air Force aircraft and aerospace accidents, to prepare a publicly-releasable report, to gather
   and preserve evidence for use in litigation, claims, disciplinary actions, administrative
   proceedings, and for other purposes not specific to mishap prevention. AIB investigators
   have access to all the non-privileged testimony and evidence (factual data) pertaining to the
   accident, including the evidence contained in Part I of the formal SIB report. The AIB
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                              45


   investigators are provided with a list of the witnesses interviewed by the SIB. The AIB may
   interview controllers (including SIB witnesses) and obtain controller statements or testimony.
   SIB witnesses will only be interviewed by the AIB after they have been released by the SIB
   President. AIB investigators will not have access to privileged testimony or statements
   provided to the SIB and contained in Part II of the formal SIB report. Statements and
   testimony made during AIB investigations may be releasable to the public. Controllers may
   seek legal counsel before making statements or providing testimony to the AIB.
   5.3.3. Factual records about HATR, near midair collision reports, systems errors, or
   deviations are releasable to any government agency conducting the investigation without
   reference to the FOIA. Units should cooperate to the maximum extent possible to make
   factual information available to the investigating agency. The investigator may also request
   AOF personnel to provide statements as supplemental information to aid in the investigation.
   These statements should contain factual information only.
   5.3.4. FAA, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and USAF investigators have
   access to factual records pertinent to an alleged violation of flying regulations. In accordance
   with AFI 91-206 (I), Participation in a Military or Civil Aircraft Accident Safety
   Investigation, military commanders will furnish all reasonable assistance within their
   capability to other Government activities participating in an aircraft accident investigation.
   Requests for specific information should be routed through military commanders. These
   investigators may request controller statements or testimony. Controller statements and
   testimony made during this type of investigation are releasable to the public. Controllers
   may seek legal counsel before making statements or testimony to accident investigators. Do
   not release names of individuals involved without the specific approval of HQ USAF/A3O.
   5.3.5. The Department of the Air Force discloses its records to the public, unless these
   records are exempt from public disclosure. DoD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement,
   DoD Freedom of Information Act Program, outlines procedures for disclosure of records and
   lists specific exemptions for withholding records. Process any non-governmental request that
   cites the FOIA through the Wing or base FOIA office.
   5.3.6. All requests for release of safety information from foreign governments or their
   representatives, including host nation mishap investigation teams, should be referred to the
   AFSC/JAR for staffing.
5.4. Removing Original Records. With the exception of official safety investigations, do not
release recorded or written records concerning mishaps without authority from the OG/CC (or
designated representative/equivalent). Requests for safety investigations must be made to Wing
Safety. Due to the potential for recording over or deleting original recordings, original recorded
records shall be retained in the AOF files and a certified transcript or certified tape copy be
released to appropriate authorities. Release transcripts/voice recordings FOR OFFICIAL USE
ONLY to a recognized investigation authority. To ensure custodial control, written and recorded
records should not be released to an intermediary collection agency that is not a member of the
investigation board. If the original recording is released, keep a copy of the original recording
with the custodian. Note: IAW FAA guidance, a DAT recording derived from the hard drive of
the DVRS is certified as an original recording.
   5.4.1. At joint-use RAPCONs, where the USAF has furnished recorder equipment, the FAA
   maintains custodial control of recordings. If the USAF requires access to a tape of one of its
 46                                                  AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


   positions in the facility, the FAA plays back the recording. If the mishap involves an FAA
   controller, the FAA provides a copy of the original voice recording for the use of
   investigators.
   5.4.2. If there is a need for a transcript or an additional tape copy, make it from the original
   recording. Only two certified re-recordings of the original (DAT) recording should be made.
   Any additional re-recordings should be made from a certified copy of the original. When
   making a tape copy include all transmissions from initial call-up to at least 5 minutes after
   last contact. Use a speaker-to-microphone method to copy when the equipment will not
   electronically connect. Preface the reproduction with "I certify this to be a true and exact
   (copy or transcript) of the original recording on file at this office at (base name)‖ (Name and
   Grade); (Title). Also include the date and time of reproduction, the name of the person
   supervising the reproduction and a certification that the reproduction is a true copy of the
   original recording.
   5.4.3. The data extraction recordings of automated radar systems to a computer extraction
   disc are normally useless to a requesting party unless reduced to a printed hard-copy form.
   Therefore, when filling a request for computer data, the disc will be reduced to printed form
   unless the requesting party specifically requests the recorded data extraction. After a
   successful reduction to printed form, the disc may be returned to service through the normal
   rotation cycle unless a specific request is received to retain the disc in its entirety. The
   following disclaimer will be attached to any computer reproduction: ―THIS DOCUMENT IS
   DERIVED FROM COMPUTER MAGNETIC RECORDINGS OF INTERNAL
   COMPUTER PROCESSING. IT IS NOT AN EXACT REPRESENTATION OF THE
   CONTROL POSITION DISPLAY.‖ The printout data is considered an official record and
   shall be retained as part of the records identified in paragraph 5.2.1.1
5.5. How To Prepare Transcripts.
   5.5.1. Include the following in the heading of the written transcript.
      5.5.1.1. Subject.
      5.5.1.2. Identity of the recording facility.
      5.5.1.3. List of facilities and controller positions, and the abbreviation for each.
      5.5.1.4. Frequency, landline, or position being recorded.
      5.5.1.5. Date and time covered by the transcript.
      5.5.1.6. Source of time entries; for example, time announcer, radio broadcast,
      reconstruction from timing tape, etc.
      5.5.1.7. Certification statement IAW paragraph 5.4.2
   5.5.2. Abbreviate each facility in the transcript by using the location designator, followed by
   the facility and control position. Identify aircraft by an abbreviated call sign if confusion will
   not result. Precede each transmission with the time the transmission began and identity of the
   transmitting source. When the source is unknown, use UNK. Single-space the body of the
   transcription. Double-space between each transmission. Show unintelligible transmissions by
   a series of asterisks. At the end of the transcript, center the statement, ―END OF
   TRANSCRIPT‖.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                              47


   5.5.3. Certify copies of written records or tape transcripts as follows: "I certify this to be a
   true and exact (copy or transcript) of the original recording on file at this office at (base
   name)‖ (Name and Grade); (Title).
5.6. ATC Forms. Unless otherwise indicated, maintain all forms as official facility records
according to AFI 33-364, Records Disposition—Procedures and Responsibilities. Publish proper
documentation and management of forms in the appropriate LOP.
   5.6.1. If not already on requirement for FAA forms or publications, order these through the
   base publications office or the nearest FAA facility.
   5.6.2. Flight Progress Strips. Any FAA approved form, as determined by the type of
   printing system, may be used. Destroy after 6 months.
   5.6.3. AF IMT 3616, Daily Record of Facility Operation. Use AF IMT 3616 to document
   all abnormal conditions and occurrences during each shift in the AO facilities. Entries made
   by other than the WS or SC must include the controller‘s operating initials. Facilities may
   initiate a new form at the beginning of each shift or use one form for a 24-hour period.
   CCTLRs must ensure standardization and adherence to local directives by reviewing and
   initialing all AF IMTs 3616. This form may be computer generated, typed or hand written.
   Destroy after 6 months.
       5.6.3.1. WS or SC accepts responsibility for the facility by making an initial entry with
       the exact time and their operating initials in the remarks section. Document temporary
       absences during the shift unless you can immediately recall the controller to duty.
       Anytime a WS or SC is relieved, enter the first name initial and last name and indicate
       transfer of responsibility for the shift on AF IMT 3616 (e.g. "1310 T. SMITH OFF, TZ
       ON AS WS"). Entering the name of the relieved WS or SC serves the same purpose as
       signing the certification statement at the top of the actual form. The WS or SC
       responsible for the shift, when the form is printed, must sign under the certification
       statement at the top of the form. Individuals may correct or re-accomplish entries before
       making a hard copy but must not change the entries of a previous WS or SC without their
       consent.
       5.6.3.2. Use only authorized USAF, FAA, and International Civil Aviation Organization
       (ICAO) abbreviations and phrase contractions. In addition to USAF, FAA, and ICAO
       abbreviations, facility CCTLRs may develop local abbreviations provided they are
       identified in their facility OI.
       5.6.3.3. CCTLRs may authorize use of this form to log position times instead of AF IMT
       3626, Position Log. The CCTLR specifies which form to use and procedures for logging
       the position times. Use of either form will be consistent throughout the facility (use AF
       IMT 3616 all the time or AF IMT 3626 all the time).
   5.6.4. AF IMT 3626, Position Log. Use AF IMT 3626 to record individuals responsible for
   each operating position. The controller being relieved must place the relieving controller‘s
   operating initials on the form at the time they assume responsibility for the position. If
   assigning a trainee to a position, enter their initials on the form followed by the relieving
   controller‘s operating initials. CCTLRs may specify multiple positions to use a single
   position log, each position using one side of the form (positions that are side by side,
 48                                                AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


   simulator positions, etc). The WS position does not require a position log. Destroy after six
   months.
   5.6.5. AF IMT 3624, Equipment Outage Log. Use AF IMT 3624 or AF IMT 3616 to record
   equipment outages or malfunctions and maintenance notifications. Use one form until filled,
   or as directed by the CCTLR. Transfer open entries when starting a new log. Use of either
   form will be consistent throughout the facility (use AF IMT 3624 all the time or AF IMT
   3616 all the time). Destroy after 6 months.
   5.6.6. AF IMT 3615, Required Data for Performing Precision Approach Radar (PAR)
   Alignments (not applicable for GPN-22). CCTLRs must use AF IMT 3615 for PAR
   alignment voltage computations. Get correct voltages from maintenance personnel.
   Maintain one copy on file and provide extracts for controller use during PAR alignments.
   Destroy when superseded. Note: This form is primarily used by Air Traffic Control and
   Landing System (ATCALS) maintenance.
   5.6.7. AF IMT 3622, Air Traffic Control/Weather Certification and Rating Record. Use AF
   IMT 3622 to document limited weather certifications, ATC position certifications, WS/CIC
   certifications, trainer qualifications, and facility ratings.
   5.6.8. AF IMT 3623, Daily Traffic Count, see details for use in paragraph 5.8.3.
5.7. Charts, Maps, Publications and Instruction Files.
   5.7.1. Each ATC facility must maintain current FLIP documents pertinent to their area of
   responsibility. They must also display their area of control and depict the location (bearing
   and distance) and frequency of each Navigational Aid (NAVAID). Control towers and RFC
   facilities are exempt from displaying their area of control.
   5.7.2. CCTLRs must provide a Recent Information File (RIF) and ensure review by all
   controllers. The RIF may be a folder, clipboard, binder or an automated display.
   5.7.3. CCTLRs must develop a suitable RRF or display tailored to each operating position.
   Define, identify and maintain local procedures or instructions supplementing regulatory
   guidance pertinent to an operating position. Automated versions may have a backup hard
   copy maintained at the WS desk. Note: The intent of the RRF files is not to reiterate LOPs,
   operating instructions, etc., but to streamline information for rapid reference in time sensitive
   situations. Information should not be simply cut and pasted from an LOP, but extracted in an
   easy to read, checklist type format.
       5.7.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Automated version MUST have a backup hard copy available
       for each operating position. Hard copies must coincide with automated versions.
   5.7.4. Control towers must maintain:
       5.7.4.1. Current on-base crash grid maps (off-base, when available). CCTLRs shall
       verify accuracy of grid maps with base Civil Engineering (CE), at least annually.
          5.7.4.1.1. Instruction on how to read a crash grid map is located in AFPAM 10-100,
          Airman’s Manual, Section 6.
       5.7.4.2. Airport diagram (runways, ramps, barrier or arresting gear, blind spots, overrun
       information, precision approach critical areas, Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ)
       markings, etc.).
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                            49


      5.7.4.3. Visibility checkpoint chart(s) and/or visibility aids (day and night markers)

  category, type or approach being conducted. When controlling a formation through
  instructions to a single aircraft within the flight, radar facilities will record a count of one for
  the flight for each category, type or approach being conducted. When formation flights are
  split into smaller formations or single aircraft, record a count of one for each formation or
  single aircraft for each category, type of approach being conducted. Count aircraft
  operations according to category, type of activity and type of approach. Note: Do not count
  aircraft traversing Special Use Airspace (e.g. Military Operating Areas) as a separate
  operation for traffic count purposes.

7.4. ATC Restrictions and Duty Limitations: In order to manage or operate a control position
in a USAF ATC facility, individuals must comply with 14 CFR, Part 65, Certification: Airman
Other Than Flight Crew Members. Applicable requirements have been incorporated into this
instruction. Local procedures to ensure compliance with the following must be specified in an
LOP.
   7.4.1. Medical Requirements:
       7.4.1.1. Military controllers must meet physical qualifications according to AFI 48-123,
       Medical Examination and Standards. Civilian (GS-2152) controllers must obtain and
       maintain a valid Class II FAA physical examination and certificate. The physical
       examination for GS-2152s must be performed by a designated Aero Medical Examiner
       (AME). Note 1: Payment of the annual GS-2152 Class II physical examination is a unit
       responsibility as a condition of employment. Note 2: As per the Air Force Medical
       Support Agency, an AME-certified military doctor can perform duties of Aero Medical
       Examiner.
       7.4.1.2. Personnel may perform ATC duties even though they are taking innocuous
       medication, such as aspirin derivatives, vitamin preparations, nose drops and skin
       ointments.
       7.4.1.3. In general, personnel ordinarily assigned to an operating position, including
       those who directly supervise within the facility, must not use the types of drugs listed
       below within a 24-hour period before assumption of duty unless a medical waiver is
       obtained:
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                          67


        7.4.1.3.1. Sedatives.
        7.4.1.3.2. Tranquilizers.
        7.4.1.3.3. Any drug, such as but not limited to, anti-hypertensive agents or duodenal
        ulcer medications, which has an effect on the central autonomic nervous system.
        7.4.1.3.4. Any other drug and/or medication likely to affect the alertness, judgment,
        vision, equilibrium or state of consciousness.
     7.4.1.4. Controllers must not be assigned ATC duties for at least eight hours after
     donating blood (formal flight surgeon restriction not required). Controllers must
     coordinate with the CCTLR prior to giving blood to minimize mission impact.
     7.4.1.5. Controllers receiving unscheduled medical/dental treatment (e.g., emergency
     room) must be cleared by the appropriate medical authority before performing ATC
     duties. If emergency medical care/treatment is required, notify the CCTLR as soon as
     possible. Controllers must coordinate with the CCTLR prior to receiving medical/dental
     treatment or immunizations that could affect duty performance capability.
        7.4.1.5.1. Military controllers must be cleared by the flight surgeon. Civilian (GS-
        2152) controllers must be cleared by the appropriate Aero Medical Examiner.
        7.4.1.5.2. Controllers must coordinate elective medical procedures with the CCTLR
        to avoid unplanned loss of work due to Duties Not Involving Controlling (DNIC)
        status that may result from the procedure. Note: Controllers cannot perform ATC
        duties for at least 8 hours after receiving a local or regional anesthetic agent.
     7.4.1.6. Controllers must neither perform ATC duties nor directly supervise other
     controllers, while under the influence of alcohol, (Blood alcohol level of .04 or greater)
     or within 12 hours of consuming any amount of alcohol. If alcohol is used during off
     duty time, it should be conservative so an individual‘s mental alertness and ability to
     perform are not reduced by the after effects (hangover) of alcohol. Abstinence 12 hours
     before commencing ATC duties does not guarantee blood alcohol level below .04 at the
     start of duty when large amounts are consumed.
     7.4.1.7. Remote or Isolated Duty. Controllers going to a base/location that does not have
     a USAF medical treatment facility with a Physical Examination Section, complete a
     Preventive Health Assessment (PHA) or periodic medical examination as required, if the
     exam is due during the tour/deployment. Controllers assigned to remote sites where
     required interval medical examinations are not available are authorized no more than a 6
     month deferral period to allow mission completion. This deferred period is effective only
     while assigned to the remote site. Controllers must ensure currency once assigned to a
     base with medical facilities capable of performing examinations.
  7.4.2. Hours of Duty. To enhance flight safety, air traffic controllers‘ duty hours are
  restricted to ensure that they are not fatigued while performing ATC duty. CCTLRs must
  comply with the following guidance when scheduling air traffic controllers for duty.
     7.4.2.1. A normal shift should be 8 hours and must not exceed 10 hours.
     7.4.2.2. A scheduled off-duty period between shifts must occur. The duration of the off-
     duty period will be at least 12 hours for military and Unit Type Code (UTC) tasked DoD
 68                                                 AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


      (civilian Title 5 position also assigned as a Reservist to a deployable UTC) controllers,
      and at least eight hours for Civilian DoD controllers.
      7.4.2.3. When unforeseen events prevent staffing a facility as scheduled (emergency
      leaves, controllers in DNIC status, or other short-notice unexpected loss of personnel),
      controllers may be recalled to ATC duty with only 8 hours between shifts.
      7.4.2.4. Duty time begins with the first scheduled duty, either ATC or non-ATC. Once
      duty time begins, it is continuous. After 10 hours of continuous duty, controllers must
      not perform further ATC duty. A 12-hour uninterrupted break (8 hours when unforeseen
      events occur and/or for non-UTC tasked DoD civilian controllers) must occur before the
      controller‘s next scheduled duty time requiring performance of ATC duties. Controllers
      must have at least 24 hours of uninterrupted, off-duty time following 6 consecutive days
      of duty.
      7.4.2.5. MAJCOM and Numbered Air Force (NAF) commanders may direct 12-hour
      surge shifts only at locations outside the NAS, where required to support contingencies or
      exercises. When using surge shifts, controllers must have a 12-hour uninterrupted rest
      period between shifts.
7.5. ATC Certification Requirements:
   7.5.1. Only personnel, to include host nation and sister service (USN, USA or USMC), who
   have successfully completed a formal DoD or DoT basic ATC course may issue control
   instructions to aircraft or be assigned to an operating position.
   7.5.2. Only qualified controllers may work in a position without a trainer/monitor.
   7.5.3. Tower personnel must be certified by a designated weather examiner per the
   Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW) Program and document on AF IMT 3622 prior to
   receiving their initial position certification within a tower facility.
      7.5.3.1. Control tower facility managers will ensure visibility observation training is
      completed and documented in the appropriate Career Field Education Training Plan
      (CFETP)/Specialty Training Standard (STS) prior to controllers obtaining a weather
      certification.
   7.5.4. Only position certified and trainer qualified controllers may train or monitor a trainee.
   7.5.5. Controllers will not train or monitor more than one trainee in position at a time.
   7.5.6. Apprentice controllers who have not been awarded an SEI must not control
   emergency aircraft unless being formally evaluated for position certification or facility rating.
   7.5.7. Controllers who have never previously held an RFC certification will not monitor an
   instrument approach or perform as a final controller when the ceiling is less than 1,000 feet
   or the visibility is less than 3 miles, unless being formally evaluated for position certification
   or facility rating.
   7.5.8. Non-position certified controllers, regardless of previous experience, must not control
   an emergency aircraft on radar final approach when the ceiling is less than 1,000 feet or
   visibility is less than 3 miles, even when being formally evaluated.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                                 69


7.6. Proficiency Program. CCTLRs must establish monthly position time requirements and
track controller proficiency time, using the program developed and maintained by HQ AFFSA,
from the first to the last day of each calendar month, and outline additional actions to be taken
when a controller fails to meet monthly proficiency time requirements in a facility OI.
7.6. (USAFE)CCTLRs will outline HN proficiency requirements for those locations
governed by HN rules.
   7.6.1. Controllers must maintain proficiency in all positions in which they are certified.
   When positions are combined, proficiency time may count for each position provided the
   controller performs ATC duties associated with each position under normal workload
   conditions. A controller must perform air traffic control duties under normal workload
   conditions in each operating position they are certified in no later than the last day of each
   month. Facility CCTLR will define ―normal workload conditions‖ in the facility OI.
   7.6.2. Only apprentice controllers, prior to receiving initial SEI, can receive proficiency time
   while being monitored for the positions in which they are certified.
   7.6.3. Simulation scenarios may be used to maintain controller proficiency; however,
   simulation must not exceed 50% of the time requirement.
7.7. Consolidating Positions. Assign personnel to positions as required by activity, equipment
and facility function. Consolidate positions only after considering activity and qualifications of
the personnel involved (see paragraph 7.3 for facility staffing requirements). Do not combine
Local Control with any other operating position, except during periods of authorized single-
controller operations.
7.8. Operating Initials. CCTLRs must assign two-letter operating initials to controllers in
order to identify them for record purposes. Unless signatures are specifically requested,
controllers use assigned operating initials for all operating forms, interphone contacts, marking
of recordable data media, and other records. CCTLRs must maintain a listing of controller
initials. Duty rosters with name and initials can meet this requirement. ATC personnel shall use
3-letter payroll initials (e.g., JAD) to sign off tasks on the AF IMT 1098, CFETP, or AF IMT
797.
7.9. Pre-Duty Familiarization. CCTLRs must establish pre-duty familiarization procedures
that provide for smooth transition from one crew to the next. Procedures should allow for
continuity of ATC services without interruption. CCTLRs may increase the number of items
and/or the level of detail of the pre-duty briefing and the position relief checklist as deemed
necessary. Address the following areas to facility operations, as applicable:
   7.9.1. Status Information Areas/Boards.
   7.9.2. Equipment (e.g. NAVAIDs, radar, radios, weather dissemination systems, etc.).
   7.9.3. Airport Conditions/Status.
   7.9.4. Airport Activities (e.g. snow removal, vehicles on runway, etc.).
   7.9.5. Altimeter/Trends.
   7.9.6. Weather (current/forecasted).
   7.9.7. Special Activities (e.g., restricted/warning areas in use, air shows, flight checks, etc.).
 70                                               AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


   7.9.8. Special Instructions/Restrictions (e.g., due to adjacent position training, non-standard
   staffing/configuration, etc.).
   7.9.9. Facility Staffing/Training Assignments (e.g., current/proposed daily training plan).
   7.9.10. New procedures.
   7.9.11. Use of position relief checklist.
   7.9.12. NOTAMs.
   7.9.13. Controllers must read/sign off on operational procedure changes prior to assignment
   to an operational position.
7.10. Wind Information.
   7.10.1. Wind sensors must be selected for the approach end of runway unless an operational
   advantage will result from another setting. Advise pilots if reported wind is from other than
   the approach end of runway. This may be accomplished by including information on the
   ATIS broadcast and pilots advise they have current ATIS information.
   7.10.2. Issue wind direction and speed from wind displays. For example: WIND TWO-
   TWO-ZERO AT ONE-FIVE. When wind displays are unavailable, issue wind information
   contained in the latest weather sequence, prefaced with the term ―Wind Estimated.‖ Note:
   Base Weather is the authority for determining if winds should be estimated.
      7.10.2.1. Issue wind gusts when observed. For example: WIND TWO-TWO-ZERO AT
      ONE-FIVE, GUST TWO-SEVEN. Wind gust is defined as a 10-minute peak wind speed
      only when that peak exceeds the wind speed lull by 10 knots or more.
      7.10.2.2. Issue variable wind information when observed. For example: WIND
      THREE-ONE-ZERO AT ONE-FIVE, VARIABLE BETWEEN TWO-SEVEN-ZERO
      AND THREE-FOUR-ZERO. Variable wind is defined as a wind direction change of 60
      degrees or more in the preceding 2 minutes, when the wind speed is greater than 6 knots.
      For reasons of operational advantage or pattern efficiency, the OG/CC may waive the
      requirement to issue variable winds to Wing aircraft. If waived, document procedures in
      the AOI.
      7.10.2.3. Issue gust spread only if specifically requested by the pilot. For example:
      GUST SPREAD TWO-THREE. Gust spread is defined as the difference between wind
      speed lull and wind speed peak during the preceding 10 minutes.
7.11. Use of Communications. Use ATC frequencies for the transmission of authorized ATC
instructions and information.
   7.11.1. Personnel must not transmit or permit the transmission of:
      7.11.1.1. Non-ATC instructions and information, except as in paragraph 7.11.2 and
      7.11.3 below.
      7.11.1.2. Obscene, indecent or profane language.
      7.11.1.3. False or deceptive communications.
      7.11.1.4. Willful or malicious interference with other communications.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                               71


       7.11.1.5. Superfluous or unauthorized transmissions including remarks of a personal
       nature.
   7.11.2. Occasionally, it is necessary to transmit a message not directly associated with ATC,
   but pertains to safety of aircraft operation or preserving life or property. In these emergency
   situations, controllers or non-ATC individuals may transmit such a message. A non-ATC
   person may transmit this kind of message if:
       7.11.2.1. They coordinate transmissions with ATC facilities prior to transmitting.
       7.11.2.2. They do not issue ATC instructions.
       7.11.2.3. Controllers can interrupt transmissions to continue ATC services.
   7.11.3. ATC facilities relay essential non-ATC instructions to aircraft if no other source of
   communications is available and transmissions do not interfere with the controller‘s
   responsibility to prevent collision between aircraft.
       7.11.3.1. Commanders must ensure maximum use of pilot-to-dispatch, operations center,
       or similar facilities to relay non-ATC information.
       7.11.3.2. Relaying Distinguished Visitor (DV) information is necessary for military
       protocol. An ATC facility with direct landline capability may relay DV information to a
       single agency (AM, Operations Center or Command Post). The ATC facility notifies the
       agency only once. This duty is secondary to providing ATC services. The use of
       electronic flight progress strips constitutes notification if procedures are contained in a
       LOP or AOI.
       7.11.3.3. When an unauthorized agency uses an ATC frequency, make an entry on the
       AF IMT 3616. The AOF/CC must advise the proper base official for appropriate action.
   7.11.4. Unless safety of flight or necessity for the control of air traffic dictates otherwise,
   controllers should avoid transmitting to aircraft in the following critical phases of flight:
   short final, touchdown, landing roll, departure roll, and initial climb-out.
7.12. Landline Operations. ATC facilities must have direct and reliable landline
communications with adjacent terminal and en route facilities and specified base agencies. Each
telephone line and landline must terminate in a communications key system in the facility, if
possible. A direct landline is a dedicated telephone circuit that terminates in two facilities only,
with no access available by another facility. Two-digit ring lines between en route and terminal
facilities meet the above criteria. Note: The optimum configuration between ATC facilities is a
direct ring line or a "shout" line.
7.13. Radar and Tower Coordination.
   7.13.1. To ensure proper sequencing of all arriving IFR and/or VFR radar traffic, define
   radar and tower coordination procedures in an LOP.
       7.13.1.1. Establishing Local Procedures and Requirements:
           7.13.1.1.1. The distances from touchdown or end of runway specified below for the
           amber and green lights are the minimum. Adjust distances outward, if necessary, to
           meet local operating conditions in an LOP.
           7.13.1.1.2. Do not modify the meaning or use of the red light.

         7.13.1.1.3. Define multiple approach procedures, where required.
     7.13.1.2. Wake Turbulence Separation. When mixing aircraft operating in the VFR
     traffic pattern with IFR arrivals, tower controllers must ensure appropriate wake
     turbulence separation exists, or will exist, before turning an aircraft inside the IFR aircraft
     on final.
  7.13.2. At locations without an installed radar and tower coordination system, establish
  procedures that ensure tower controllers receive information in accordance with paragraph
  7.13.3.1.1
  7.13.3. If available, use an installed radar and tower coordination system to coordinate all
  arriving radar traffic as follows:
     7.13.3.1. Flashing White Light. An arriving aircraft has reached a specified point from
     the runway (normally 15 flying miles):
         7.13.3.1.1. Radar controller activates the flashing white light and furnishes the tower
         controller with aircraft identification, type, position, type of approach, and type of
         landing. State range if other than specified in the LOP. Facility managers may
         reduce or modify the information specified to meet operational needs.
         7.13.3.1.2. Tower controller steadies the white light acknowledging receipt of arrival
         information.
         7.13.3.1.3. Unless local procedures require radar monitoring using PAR equipment,
         CCTLRs may develop procedures that allow the aircraft to contact the tower after the
         tower controller steadies the white light.
     7.13.3.2. Flashing Amber Light. An aircraft is (minimum) 7 miles from touchdown or
     end of runway and the radar controller is requesting tower approval for the aircraft to
     continue:
         7.13.3.2.1. Radar controller activates the flashing amber light. State range if other
         than specified in the LOP.
         7.13.3.2.2. Tower controller steadies the amber light to acknowledge the position of
         the aircraft and to approve continuation of the approach to 3 miles.
     7.13.3.3. Flashing Green Light. An aircraft is (minimum) 4 miles from touchdown or
     end of runway and the radar controller is requesting tower clearance for landing, touch-
     and-go, stop and go, low approach or for the option.
         7.13.3.3.1. Radar controller activates the flashing green light, verbally stating type
         landing and operating position. State range if other than specified in the LOP.
         7.13.3.3.2. Tower controller steadies the green light and issues a verbal landing,
         touch-and-go, stop and go, low approach or for the option clearance when the aircraft
         is (minimum) 4 miles, but not closer than 3 miles, from touchdown or end of runway.
         The clearance includes field and traffic information if appropriate, and altitude
         restrictions for a low approach, if required.
         7.13.3.3.3. Radar controller relays the tower clearance verbatim (may simultaneously
         transmit the clearance to the aircraft and tower).
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                             73


     7.13.3.4. Red Light. A flashing red light cancels the clearance for aircraft on final
     approach. Unless otherwise stated, it applies only to the first aircraft on final approach.
         7.13.3.4.1. Tower controller activates the flashing red light when denying or
         canceling a clearance and furnishes a reason.
         7.13.3.4.2. Radar controller steadies the red light after issuing the clearance denial or
         cancellation to the aircraft (may accomplish by steadying the red light simultaneously
         with the transmission of go-around instructions).
         7.13.3.4.3. The radar controller may activate the red light and must verbally advise
         the tower of a radar-initiated go-around for the first aircraft on final. Tower steadies
         the flashing red light indicating receipt of the radar-initiated go-around.
  7.13.4. Use of QUICK LOOK Functions. QUICK LOOK functions may be used to
  coordinate aircraft arrivals, at locations where data from a system common to the servicing
  radar approach control facility and the control tower are presented on a Certified Tower
  Radar Display (CTRD), only if operational benefits will be accrued. In addition to the data
  on the CTRD, required keyboard capabilities to effect needed coordination must also be
  installed.
     7.13.4.1. QUICK LOOK coordination, without some means of ensuring tower actively
     acknowledges inbound aircraft, is not recommended at locations with high density traffic
     and/or diverse or unpredictable arrival patterns. Determination of whether or not quick
     look is operationally beneficial is best decided at the unit level. USAF VFR towers who
     receive approach control service from FAA facilities and use automation for transferring
     control of aircraft, must not enter into any agreement unless the agreement stipulates an
     alternate means of transferring control of aircraft (e.g. landline coordination) when the
     CTRD is not operational. Examples of actively acknowledging inbound aircraft include
     steadying the flash on an automated handoff or verbal acknowledgement via landline.
     7.13.4.2. The use of automated handoffs in this context constitutes a transfer of
     information only and must not be considered a radar handoff. When QUICK LOOK is
     used to coordinate arrivals, the LOP governing tower/radar coordination procedures must
     specify:
         7.13.4.2.1. Procedures for data transfer between the radar facility and tower.
         7.13.4.2.2. Communications changeover points.
         7.13.4.2.3. Hours or conditions under which facility policy prohibits use of these
         functions.
         7.13.4.2.4. The authority of the local controller or tower watch supervisor to
         determine whether use of the QUICK LOOK function is satisfactory or some other
         means of arrival coordination is required.
     7.13.4.3. Factors to be considered by the tower in determining whether to use or prohibit
     the use of the QUICK LOOK function includes, but is not limited to:
         7.13.4.3.1. Light on the face of the CTRD.
         7.13.4.3.2. Traffic volume and diversity.
 74                                                 AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


           7.13.4.3.3. The number of controllers available in the tower.
           7.13.4.3.4. Other duties requiring the controller‘s attention.
   7.13.5. Rolling/boundary notification. Automation is an authorized/approved method to
   establish nonverbal rolling/boundary notification for each departing aircraft.
   7.13.6. Initial Departure Separation (e.g. Automatic Releases). When the radar facility
   delegates automatic release authority, tower personnel must provide initial separation for
   arriving/departing aircraft provided these procedures are identified in an LOP.
       7.13.6.1. At a minimum, the LOP covering procedures for Initial Departure Separation
       (Automatic Releases) must include:
           7.13.6.1.1. Arrival/Departure minimum cut-off distances.
           7.13.6.1.2. A statement mandating ―Automatic releases are not authorized when the
           official weather for the airport is reported as less than a 1000‘ ceiling and/or less than
           3 miles official visibility or when the tower visibility is reported as less than 3 miles.‖
           7.13.6.1.3. Either facility may cancel automatic releases when deemed necessary.
7.14. Minimum Distance Without Final Clearance. Do not continue a radar or radar-
monitored approach closer than 3 miles from touchdown using PAR equipment or 3 miles from
end of runway using ASR equipment without verbal clearance from the tower controller. These
requirements must be contained in an LOP between the tower and the servicing radar facility.
7.15. Opposite Direction Traffic. Define opposite direction procedures in the AOI and when
the FAA provides radar services define in an LOA. All coordination must include the phrase
"OPPOSITE DIRECTION DEPARTURE OR ARRIVAL (as appropriate), RUNWAY
(number)."
   7.15.1. Opposite direction procedures apply to all aircraft regardless whether or not the
   aircraft is operating VFR or IFR. Locations that require opposite direction traffic must
   define minimum opposite direction cutoff points, distances, or fixes for the following
   operations:
       7.15.1.1. Arrival versus arrival.
       7.15.1.2. Arrival versus departure, low approach, etc.
   7.15.2. Consider all airfield conditions and flight profiles (tactical procedures) that may
   affect opposite direction operations.
7.16. Practice Approaches/Departures. VFR aircraft practicing instrument approaches at the
approach control's primary airport must be provided IFR separation. The primary airport is the
airport from which approach control service is provided.
   7.16.1. Tactical Approach/Departure requirements must be established in an LOP between
   participating agencies and aircraft. Guidance must include traffic patterns and cut-off point
   definitions and procedures to ensure protection of non-participating aircraft.
7.17. Clearance Delivery. The clearance delivery function must be performed by a controller
not actively controlling airborne traffic. Exception: Clearance delivery may be operated by a
controller actively controlling aircraft when facilities are staffed by a single 7-level or civilian
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                             75


equivalent in accordance with paragraph 7.3. A clearance delivery position in a RAPCON must
have a discrete frequency dedicated to clearance delivery and must not be keyed simultaneously
with other frequencies.
7.18. Emergency Frequencies. ATC facilities, except GCA and RFC, must have transmit and
receive capability on emergency frequencies 121.5 and 243.0 MHz. Continuously monitor the
emergency frequencies during operational hours. When more than one USAF ATC facility
shares the emergency radio equipment, the tower must have override capability. Tower should
have override capability on emergency radio equipment shared with FAA ATC facilities. ATC
facilities must have an override capability on emergency radio equipment shared by non-ATC
agencies. Note: Check override capability at least once daily.
   7.18.1. ATC personnel will normally handle an unscheduled personnel, emergency or crash
   locator beacon signal, as an emergency, regardless of duration. The WG/CC may require a
   lesser level of notification and response and direct ATC not to activate the PCAS. The
   WG/CC must ensure notification and response procedures are established. If controllers do
   not activate the PCAS, the ATC facility notifies a single named, base agency and the Air
   Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) or appropriate host nation equivalent. Define
   procedures in the AOI.
   7.18.2. Operational testing of a personnel, emergency, or crash locator beacon may not
   require a response when it is conducted within the first five minutes of the hour and is no
   longer than three audio sweeps.
7.19. Interruptions to ATCALS. The commander responsible for ATCALS must ensure
ATCALS are available to support the flying mission. Maintenance personnel response
times/actions must be established in an LOP. Preventive Maintenance (PM) on ATCALS
ensures the equipment performs at an optimum level. The commander responsible for ATCALS
maintenance, subject to OG/CC approval, specifies a recurring PM schedule. When developing
a standardized, recurring PM schedule, consider safety, local and adjacent base military and civil
flying support requirements, current and forecasted weather, equipment reliability, redundancy
and maintenance requirements. Publish the PM schedule in an LOP. AM submits the base PM
schedule for inclusion in the FLIPs. The AOF/CC establishes procedures for reporting and
coordinating ATCALS interruptions and malfunctions in an LOP. ATCALS electromagnetic
interference should be reported according to AFI 10-707, Spectrum Interference Resolution
Program.
   7.19.1. Before turning a facility over for PM during other than published maintenance
   periods:
       7.19.1.1. Maintenance workers must request approval for the work far enough in
       advance to allow for coordination.
       7.19.1.2. The AOF/CC or designated representative coordinates the downtime of a
       facility and notifies maintenance of approval/disapproval.
           7.19.1.2.1. Before approving downtime, obtain approval from the OG/CC and notify
           the Airfield Manager (AFM) for appropriate NOTAM/airfield advisory action.
           Schedule no more than one ATCALS facility for maintenance at a time. Exception:
           Multiple ILS facilities installed at opposite ends of the same runway.
 76                                                AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


          7.19.1.2.2. When an ATCALS component is part of the NAS, coordinate with the
          appropriate ARTCC, TRACON, and Flight Service Station (FSS). The coordinating
          agency must ensure appropriate NOTAM action is taken.
          7.19.1.2.3. At multiple base complexes, coordinate PM schedules so all bases do not
          remove similar ATCALS from service at the same time.
          7.19.1.2.4. Request planned maintenance shutdown of ATCALS during periods of
          least activity, including nighttime, as much as possible.
   7.19.2. Maintenance workers must coordinate with the affected ATC WS/SC before taking
   ATCALS off the air. Define procedures in an LOP.
   7.19.3. WS/SC must not allow maintenance personnel to perform work that disrupts or
   affects the signal of a NAVAID, unless the facility is removed from service and the
   identification feature is set to ―Test‖ or is turned off.
7.20. Monitoring Navigational Aid (NAVAID) Equipment. An internal monitor is an integral
part of each NAVAID that automatically transfers transmitters or shuts down the NAVAID when
its performance falls below established tolerances. Each NAVAID used for instrument flight
must be monitored.
   7.20.1. Designate one ATC facility to be responsible for monitoring NAVAID status and
   install a Remote Status Indicator (RSI) for each NAVAID. The RSI displays the operational
   status of each NAVAID. The ATC facility monitoring the RSI informs other facilities of
   NAVAID status changes.
   7.20.2. When an RSI is inoperative or the RSI monitoring facility is unmanned, continue to
   use NAVAIDs equipped with an internal monitor as long as pilot or maintenance reports
   show the NAVAID is operating normally.
   7.20.3. For category (CAT) II ILS facilities, when the RSI fails or the facility with the RSI is
   not staffed, even though the ILS is functioning properly, downgrade the ILS to CAT I status.
   Units affected by this requirement should specify this requirement in an appropriate LOP.
   7.20.4. Snow Effects on ILS Glide Slopes. Snow accumulation must be removed from
   specific areas around the glide slope long before causing the glide angle to go out of
   tolerance. Follow procedures outlined in the AOI and Snow and Ice Control Plan to ensure
   the snow does not impact the glide slope signal. Advise AM and/or ATCALS Maintenance,
   as appropriate, when snow accumulation or drifting on the airfield may impact system
   reliability. Remove the system from service when advised by ATCALS Maintenance that
   accumulation has exceeded technical limits in accordance with maintenance Technical
   Orders, when the RSI remains in alarm after attempted resets, or when system anomalies are
   reported by pilots on final, in accordance with FAAO JO 7110.65, Chapter 2, Section 1. The
   OG/CC determines if a local fly-ability check and/or special flight inspection is required
   before returning the system to service or if pilots continue to report anomalies in the signal.
   7.20.5. At locations where NAVAIDs operate less than 24-hours daily, publish NAVAID
   operating hours in appropriate FLIPs.
7.21. Auxiliary Power for ATCALS Facilities. The OG/CC must determine which ATCALS
and ATC communications facilities require the installation and operation of auxiliary backup
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                           77


power generators and automatic start and transfer systems to ensure long term, seamless
operation in the event of a commercial power failure.
   7.21.1. The following facilities should be considered:
       7.21.1.1. NAVAIDs.
       7.21.1.2. Radar facilities, control towers.
       7.21.1.3. Transmitter or Receiver sites and Ground Air Transmitter Receiver (GATR)
       sites.
   7.21.2. At a minimum, ensure all facilities included in the NAS are in compliance with
   FAAO JO 6950.2, Electrical Power Policy Implementation at National Airspace System
   Facilities.
   7.21.3. Include auxiliary power requirements in the AOI.
   7.21.4. When automatic start and transfer capability is not available or the OG/CC has
   determined commercial or base power is unreliable to support critical mission requirements
   and aircraft launch and recovery, units should consider placing ATCALS facilities on backup
   generator power for impending severe weather conditions.
   7.21.5. Include auxiliary power procedures for all ATCALS facilities in an LOP. Consider
   all available auxiliary power sources (generators, Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) and
   battery capability), base civil engineering support (maintenance, testing, response times and
   restorable priorities for failed auxiliary power sources), and user responsibilities.
       7.21.5.1. Maintenance personnel must obtain approval from:
          7.21.5.1.1. The facility responsible for monitoring NAVAID status before
          transferring power at a NAVAID.
          7.21.5.1.2. Affected ATC facilities before transferring power at transmitter/receiver
          sites.
          7.21.5.1.3. Affected ATC facilities before transferring power at a control tower or
          radar facility.
7.22. Alternate ATC Capabilities. The OG/CC determines if there is a need for alternate ATC
capabilities to sustain ATC services during emergency conditions. Where a need has been
established define transition procedures and any restrictions on flight operations or vehicle
movement due to alternate ATC facility limitations in an LOP.
   7.22.1. The following are requirements for fixed alternate ATC facility operations:
       7.22.1.1. UHF/VHF transmitters and receivers.
       7.22.1.2. Landline communications.
       7.22.1.3. Land Mobile Radio (LMR) with transmit/receive capability.
       7.22.1.4. Control of airfield lighting.
       7.22.1.5. Applicable publications.
       7.22.1.6. NAVAID monitoring.
 78                                                 AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


       7.22.1.7. Recording equipment (if capability exists).
       7.22.1.8. Access to pertinent airfield information (NOTAMs, weather, etc.).
   7.22.2. During emergency/contingency situations, OG/CCs must determine what minimum
   equipment is necessary for ATC operations to ensure flight safety.
7.23. Precision Approach Critical Areas. Protect the precision approach critical areas in
accordance with the AOI. The localizer (Figure 7.1), the glide slope (Figure 7.2) and ILS CAT
II/PAR touchdown area (Figure 7.3), Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ), Mobile Microwave
Landing System (MMLS) azimuth critical area (Figure 7.4) and MMLS elevation critical area
(Figure 7.5). Establish touchdown areas only when the height above threshold (HATh) is less
than 200 feet for either an ILS/MMLS or PAR approach.
   7.23.1. CAT I and II ILS Localizer Critical Areas (Figure 7.1).
       7.23.1.1. When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or the visibility is less than
       2 miles, restrict all aircraft and vehicle operations in the localizer critical area. Do not
       permit vehicles or aircraft to transit the localizer critical area when an aircraft on the ILS
       approach is inside the Final Approach Fix (FAF). Exception: A preceding aircraft,
       approaching the same runway or another runway, may pass through the area while
       landing, departing, or exiting the runway; do not allow aircraft to stop within the critical
       area.
       7.23.1.2. When the reported ceiling is less than 200 feet and/or Runway Visual Range
       (RVR) 2,000 or less (1/2 mile visibility if no RVR) do not authorize vehicle or aircraft
       operations in or over the area when an arriving aircraft is inside 1 Nautical Mile (NM)
       final approach.
   7.23.2. CAT I and II ILS Glide Slope Critical Areas (Figure 7.2 and Figure 7.3).
       7.23.2.1. When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or visibility less than 2
       miles, but at or above 200 feet and/or visibility at or above 1/2 mile (RVR 2,400), restrict
       all aircraft larger than fighter type size. Do not permit these aircraft to taxi beyond the
       instrument hold line when an aircraft executing an ILS/MMLS approach is inside the
       FAF.
       7.23.2.2. When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or visibility less than 2
       miles, restrict all vehicles. Note: Vehicles (e.g., launch essential vehicle, mission support
       vehicle and end of runway vehicle) escorting the fighter type size aircraft under the
       conditions of paragraph 7.23.2.1 are authorized to proceed into the glideslope/elevation
       critical area with the aircraft (aircraft tows are not authorized). Do not permit vehicles to
       proceed beyond the instrument hold line when an aircraft executing an ILS/MMLS
       approach is inside the FAF, unless the arriving aircraft has reported the runway in sight or
       is circling to land on another runway.
       7.23.2.3. When the reported ceiling is less than 200 feet and/or visibility less than 1/2
       mile (RVR 2,400) restrict all aircraft and vehicles. Do not permit aircraft to taxi or
       vehicles to proceed beyond the instrument hold line when an aircraft executing an
       ILS/MMLS approach is inside the FAF.
   7.23.3. PAR Touchdown Areas (Figure 7.3). When the reported ceiling is less than 200 feet
   and/or the RVR is 2,000 or less (1/2 mile visibility if no RVR), do not authorize vehicles or
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                             79


  aircraft in the PAR touchdown area when an aircraft conducting an approach or missed
  approach is inside the Middle Marker (MM) or 1 NM from touchdown if no MM.
  7.23.4. MMLS Azimuth Critical Area (Figure 7.4).
     7.23.4.1. When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or the visibility is less than
     2 miles, restrict all aircraft and vehicle operations in the azimuth critical area. Do not
     permit vehicles or aircraft to transit the azimuth critical area when an aircraft on the
     MMLS approach is inside the FAF). Exception: A preceding aircraft, approaching the
     same runway or another runway, may pass through the area while landing, departing, or
     exiting the runway; do not allow aircraft to stop within the critical area.
     7.23.4.2. When the reported ceiling is less than 200 feet and/or RVR 2,000 or less (1/2
     mile if no RVR) do not authorize vehicle or aircraft operations in or over the area when
     an arriving aircraft is inside 1 NM from touchdown.
  7.23.5. MMLS Elevation Critical Areas (Figure 7.5).
     7.23.5.1. When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or visibility less than 2
     miles, but at or above 200 feet and/or visibility at or above 1/2 mile (RVR 2,400), restrict
     all aircraft larger than fighter type size. Do not permit these aircraft to taxi beyond the
     instrument hold line when an aircraft executing an MMLS approach is inside the FAF.
     7.23.5.2. When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or visibility less than 2
     miles, restrict all vehicles. Note: Vehicles escorting (e.g., launch essential vehicle,
     mission support vehicle and end of runway (EOR) vehicle) the fighter type size aircraft
     under the conditions of paragraph 7.23.5.1 are authorized to proceed into the elevation
     critical area with the aircraft (aircraft tows are not authorized). Do not permit vehicles to
     proceed beyond the instrument hold line when an aircraft executing an MMLS approach
     is inside the FAF, unless the arriving aircraft has reported the runway in sight or is
     circling to land on another runway.
     7.23.5.3. When the reported ceiling is less than 200 feet and/or visibility less than 1/2
     mile (RVR 2,400) restrict all aircraft and vehicles. Do not permit aircraft to taxi or
     vehicles to proceed beyond the instrument hold line when an aircraft executing an MMLS
     approach is inside the FAF.
  7.23.6. Criteria for Protecting Critical Area. The DoD is authorized to define criteria for
  protection of precision approach critical areas at military controlled airports. The criteria
  apply to both military and civilian operating at that military controlled airport.
     7.23.6.1. Protection of the critical area by enforcing restrictions of the CMA is essential
     to flight safety. Units should assess current operations to ensure protection of precision
     approach capability. Unit level assessment should consist of the following items:
     7.23.6.1. (USAFE) The OG/CC will define the criteria (e.g., ICAO, NATO, AFI 13-
     204V3, etc.) applied in the base AOI. CCTLRs must ensure all facilities have weather
     minimums available in meters.
         7.23.6.1.1. Evaluate the existing critical area's footprint against available options and
         select the criteria that best suits Wing operational needs, using the following
         guidelines:

        7.23.6.1.1.1. USAF criteria or FAA criteria described in FAAO JO 6750.16,
        Siting Criteria for Instrument Landing System, may be applied at any USAF
        location. NATO criteria described in APATC-1 Version A may be applied at any
        NATO base. ICAO criteria described in ICAO Attachment C to Part I of Annex
        10 may be applied at any overseas location. Do not apply more than one criteria
        to any instrument landing system, e.g. FAA localizer criteria and ICAO glideslope
        criteria.
        7.23.6.1.1.2. Application of the footprint is system dependent, not airfield
        dependent. For example, units may use FAA criteria for one system (glideslope
        or localizer) and USAF criteria for another if that configuration best suits the
        needs of a particular location.
     7.23.6.1.2. If the footprint of the selected criteria contains a stationary object (e.g.
     fence, building), ensure the unit has a current flight inspection report on file
     conducted since the object was in place. If interference is not detected, no further
     action is required. If interference is detected, the object must be removed or the
     signal will not be valid under specified weather conditions.
     7.23.6.1.3. If the footprint of the selected criteria contains a non-stationary object(s),
     one or more of the following actions must be taken:
        7.23.6.1.3.1. Establish procedural guidance to control/prohibit operations in the
        movement area when required to protect the signal for aircraft on final.
        7.23.6.1.3.2. At locations where perimeter/access roads penetrate the critical area,
        install stop lights (or an equivalent device) to prevent intrusion of vehicles not in
        direct radio contact with the tower, when inbound aircraft on the approach require
        a protected signal.
        7.23.6.1.3.3. Use alternate approach capability (e.g., PAR) when feasible and
        restrict use of the ILS/MMLS when weather conditions dictate protection of
        critical areas.
     7.23.6.1.4. MAJCOM/A3s are granted waiver authority for protection of critical
     areas at USAF locations. This authority may be delegated to respective units, but
     only to Wing Commanders. Use the following guidelines:
        7.23.6.1.4.1. Units must conduct an operational risk assessment of factors
        involved (e.g. weather criteria, mission necessity, alternative approaches
        available, reduced level of safety, standardization of air traffic control services)
        when allowing movement in the critical areas during periods when weather
        conditions dictate the area be controlled. Unit risk assessments must specifically
        address both military and civilian aircraft operations at the base. Risk
        assessments must be included as part of any waiver request package submitted to
        the MAJCOM/A3 or designated representative.
        7.23.6.1.4.2. Upon approval, procedures for implementing waivers must be
        briefed at the Airfield Operations Board (AOB) and published in the AOI.
        Appropriate entries must be published in DoD FLIP products to ensure aircrews
        are aware of criteria that have been waived.

standard log-periodic dipole antenna array is in this category. Note: Diagram remains current;
however, bi-directional localizer is no longer applicable for USAF.

4. For 8-element localizer array with course widths less than 4 degrees and runways which
operate B-747 size and larger aircraft, the Y dimension shall be 600 feet.

5. These dimensions apply where aircraft size is equal to or less than 135 feet in length or 42 feet
in height; e.g. B-727.

                                         Chapter 8

                                    ATC EQUIPMENT

8.1. Equipment Checks.
   8.1.1. CCTLRs must ensure proper operations of all equipment, to include actions after a
   power failure and generator changeover.
      8.1.1.1. CCTLRs must, with technical assistance from the NAAM, publish procedures
      and develop a detailed checklist in an LOP to ensure proper operations of DTAS,
      automated equipment, and all locally defined systems, to include procedures for periodic
      checks, system monitoring, and actions after a power failure and generator changeover.
      8.1.1.2. The WS/SC opening the facility must complete all equipment checks, as
      applicable, prior to officially opening the facility. Additionally, each on-coming watch
      supervisor must initiate an equipment checklist at the beginning of each shift and
      complete the checklist as soon as possible.
   8.1.2. Watch supervisors must verify equipment outages daily with appropriate base agency,
   and document completion of the equipment outage check on AF IMT 3616. Locations must
   establish localized procedures in an LOP to verify outages.
      8.1.2.1. ATCALS/equipment status must be classified as either in-service or out-of-
      service. ATCALS/equipment logged as out-of-service must not be used to provide ATC
      services. Terms, such as awaiting "hot check" or similar verbiage are not valid means of
      reporting/determining equipment operational status.        When maintenance reports
      equipment as usable and indications are the equipment is usable, the equipment should be
      logged "in service" and, if necessary, an airborne check must be accomplished as soon as
      practical. ATC should not solely delay closing work orders due to aircraft non-
      availability to conduct equipment checks.
   8.1.3. (Not Applicable to DTAS) Radar and Video Map Alignment. CCTLRs provide
   detailed radar and video map and alignment procedures in the appropriate ready reference
   file and/or equipment checklist as follows:
      8.1.3.1. Method for checking range/azimuth of obstruction/Permanent Echo (PE)
      symbols. The allowable tolerance for radar/map alignment is 2 percent of the ASR
      antenna-to-PE distance. The allowable tolerance for azimuth is +/- 1.0 degrees. The PE
      target and PE symbol must be checked separately, however, the tolerances are the same.
      The PE target is checked to verify radar alignment; the PE symbol check validates map
      alignment. Calculate the range tolerance using the following formula: ASR antenna-to-
      PE distance: .02 X distance (in feet) = allowable range tolerance, for example: To
      compute the allowable tolerance if the ASR-to-PE symbol/obstruction distance is 20 NM,
      multiply .02 X 20 = 0.4 NM. Thus, the PE symbol/obstruction (checked using the cursor
      and/or range strobe) must fall within +/- 0.4 NM of the actual PE symbol/obstruction
      location.
      8.1.3.2. To preclude variances in cursor read out among indicators, designate one radar
      indicator as the primary source for determining facility radar/map alignment. Controllers
      are still required to perform radar/map alignment checks at their assigned scope,
 86                                                 AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


       however, the radar and/or map generator will not be logged out until verified on the
       primary alignment scope. Fix tolerance and map alignment must be checked on the same
       range scale for which the video map was developed. See AT-R-10, Digital Map
       Development, for map development procedures.
       8.1.3.3. TPN-19 and MPN-14K1 mobile radar systems are not capable of deriving
       distance criteria, therefore, verify that the PE symbol/obstruction is within +/- 1.0 degrees
       (using the radar cursor) of the actual PE symbol/obstruction location.
       8.1.3.4. Range scale for each video map.
   8.1.4. For automated systems, verification of the accuracy of new or modified digital maps
   must be accomplished through the use of "targets of opportunity" flying over displayed fixes,
   navigational aids, etc. Any observed discrepancies must be documented to indicate the
   observed direction and displacement. If any identified error cannot be corrected or if a
   facility is otherwise dissatisfied with the results from "targets of opportunity," request a flight
   check if necessary.
8.2. Facility Clocks. A reliable clock showing hours, minutes and seconds must be visible from
each control position. Facilities without a direct coded time source must obtain a time check at
the beginning of each shift.
   8.2.1. Acquire time checks from IFR facilities equipped with a coded time source, the US
   Naval     Observatory   (Defense    Switch      Network      (DSN)     312-762-1401)      or
   http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/simpletime.html, a radar facility that provides approach service,
   host nation ARTCC/area control center responsible for the terminal area, or a
   GPS/DVRS/DALR/DTAS source.
   8.2.2. Set clocks to within 15 seconds of time source. Check clocks immediately after the
   facility goes on backup power and again 30 minutes after. If found to be inaccurate, check
   clocks hourly until restoring normal power. Note: Wind sensor equipment that provides a
   reliable clock must be checked at the beginning of each shift unless connected to a direct
   coded time source.
   8.2.3. A direct coded time source can be connected directly to the installation Local Area
   Network (LAN). The LAN must provide a Network Time Protocol (NTP) in accordance
   with AFI 33-115V1, Communications and Information to synchronize clocks with a local
   Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver.
8.3. Weather Equipment.
   8.3.1. Warning Devices (Not Applicable to Morón AB). Current observations and pertinent
   severe weather warnings, advisories, and pilot reports must be available at all controller
   positions. Where this is not possible, set up coordination procedures to ensure changes to the
   weather promptly reach each controller position. Equip automatic weather displays with a
   visual and aural alarm system suited to local operational needs. Facilities with multiple
   weather displays need only have the aural alarms operational at one position.
       8.3.1.1. FMQ-19 Weather Equipment Display. Controllers shall only issue/use the
       altimeter setting contained in the official weather observation.
   8.3.2. Radar Displayed Weather (STARS facilities only). There are no alarms to indicate to
   the controller/Radar maintenance personnel when there is significant signal loss within the
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                           87


   weather channel. To mitigate this problem, the following procedures must supplement
   guidance located in FAAO JO 7110.65, Chapter 2 Section 6. CCTLRs and NAAMs must
   ensure these procedures are published in an LOP in accordance with paragraph 5.1
       8.3.2.1. At the beginning of every shift check the accuracy of the digitized weather
       display using the best means available.
       8.3.2.2. Relay known weather channel status during position relief for all DAAS display
       control/assist positions.
       8.3.2.3. If a weather channel discrepancy is noted, document the problem and notify
       maintenance. Ensure appropriate NOTAM is issued.
8.4. Recorders. Where capabilities exist, record by operating position, individual frequency,
and landlines as determined by facility managers.
   8.4.1. Record operating positions in the following priority:
       8.4.1.1. Precision approach radar.
       8.4.1.2. Local Control.
       8.4.1.3. Primary Crash Alarm System.
       8.4.1.4. Arrival Control.
       8.4.1.5. Departure Control.
       8.4.1.6. Approach Control.
       8.4.1.7. Coordinator.
       8.4.1.8. Flight Data.
       8.4.1.9. Approach/Arrival Assistant.
       8.4.1.10. Clearance Delivery.
       8.4.1.11. Ground Control.
       8.4.1.12. Supervisor of Flying (SOF).
       8.4.1.13. Land Mobile Radio (LMR) nets.
       8.4.1.14. Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS).
       8.4.1.15. Supervisor.
       8.4.1.16. Tower backup radios.
       8.4.1.17. Administrative telephones.
   8.4.2. Multi-channel recorders/Digital Voice Recording Systems (DVRS) must have an
   approved time source installed (e.g., Global Position Satellite).
   8.4.3. Record pilot-to-dispatch and pilot-to-metro frequencies after meeting the requirements
   of paragraph 8.4.1 Use remaining channels to record individual frequencies.
   8.4.4. DVRS: Checking and changing recorder tapes. CCTLRs must establish procedures
   for DAT change/cleaning schedules. CCTLRs must consider local conditions and ensure
88                                              AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


  DAT cassettes are changed at increments that do not exhaust cassette capacity. Digital
  Audio Tape (DAT) cassette changing cycles must not exceed 73 hours.
     8.4.4.1. CCTLRs must ensure personnel performing tape/Digital Audio Tape (DAT)
     changes are trained in the proper methods to be used and task certification is documented
     in AF Form 623.
     8.4.4.2. An identification number must be assigned to each DAT cassette. As part of the
     DAT changing procedures, a checklist identifying date, time, DAT cassette in use, the
     initials of the person accomplishing the change, and reason for the change (periodic, bad
     tape, etc.) must be developed and used. A daily entry on the AF IMT 3616 may be used
     in place of a checklist, provided all the required information is included in the entry.
     Retain all DAT for 45 days, or IAW guidance in Air Force Records Information
     Management System (AFRIMS), AF Records Disposition Schedule, Table 13-06, Rule
     05.01, whichever is greater.
     8.4.4.3. Directly after a DAT tape insertion (as a standby tape), the DVRS places a date
     created tag on the tape (current Zulu date). DAT software calculates the 45-day
     overwrite protection based on the date created tag, not the last recording on the tape. If
     the recorded content of the tape exceeds two days from the date created stamp, there is a
     potential to overwrite recorded data too soon (especially for locations using DAT longer
     than a 24-hour cycle). CCTLRs must ensure enough DATs are available in the rotation
     cycle to accommodate 45-day overwrite protection. Protection must be ensured to
     prevent inadvertent loss of data at facilities using DATs for greater than 24-hour cycles.
     Locations using a 24-hour rotation cycle must ensure a minimum of 45 days between
     initial insertion and reuse. Locations using a 48-hour rotation cycle must ensure a
     minimum of 46 days between initial insertion and reuse.
     8.4.4.4. Validate Nicelog supervision window for alarms and verify normal operations of
     equipment on digital voice recorder system on a daily basis not to exceed 25 hours.
     Audio quality checks must be accomplished monthly. If this function is performed by
     maintenance, that information should be included in facility procedures. Annotate
     Nicelog verification and quality checks on AF IMT 3616 when accomplished.
     8.4.4.5. DVRS DAT cartridges must be replaced after 35 recording cycles.
     8.4.4.6. Each user of the DVRS must be issued a user unique log-in password (e.g. LOG-
     IN: RT; PASSWORD: chosen by RT). Note: Log-in password information must not be
     shared among users (e.g., LOG-IN: A Crew; PASSWORD: shared by A Crew).
     8.4.4.7. The DVRS must only be used for accessing and editing recordings made with
     the DVRS equipment. The computer workstation and logger must not be used for any
     other purpose.
     8.4.4.8. No other programs and/or software packages are to be loaded and/or executed on
     any of the DVRS system components.
     8.4.4.9. Do not lock channel(s) longer than five hours. Locking channel(s) for extended
     periods of time will overload the hard-drive and cause system failure. Make an entry on
     AF IMT 3616 to show locking and unlocking times.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                          89


  8.4.5. DALR: Verifying and operating the DALR system. CCTLRs must establish
  procedures that ensure DALR recording quality checks are accomplished at least monthly
  and include a statement on the AF IMT 3616 when such checks are accomplished. The High
  Density Logger (HDL) establishes a 45-day protection window on recorded data
  automatically.
     8.4.5.1. CCTLRS must ensure personnel performing DALR recording checks are trained
     in the proper methods to be used and task certification is documented in AF Form 623.
     8.4.5.2. CCTLRS must establish procedures to verify that the DALR is recording daily.
     A checklist identifying date, time, and the initials of the person accomplishing the check
     must be developed and used. A daily entry on the AF IMT 3616 may be used in place of
     a checklist, provided all the required information is included in the entry. Maintain this
     checklist for 45 days, or IAW guidance in Air Force Records Information Management
     System (AFRIMS), AF Records Disposition Schedule, Table 13-06, Rule 05.01,
     whichever is greater.
     8.4.5.3. Validate Simple Network Messaging Protocol (SNMPc) Management software
     is operational and verify normal operations of equipment on a daily basis not to exceed
     25 hours. An entry on the AF IMT 3616 is required.
     8.4.5.4. Rewriteable CD‘s (CD-RWs), DVD‘s, or any type of flash media are not
     authorized for use on the DALR system. Recordings shall be on a Compact Disc-
     Recordable (CD-R) or Digital Video Disc-Recordable (DVD-R) only.
        8.4.5.4.1. CD/DVD‘s shall be marked with date extracted, date/time of incident,
        facility name, and rank/name of individual accomplishing recording.
        8.4.5.4.2. DALR recordings must adhere to the requirements of Chapter 5.
        8.4.5.4.3. DALR recordings shall not be emailed.
     8.4.5.5. Each user of the DALR must be issued a user unique log-in and password (e.g.,
     LOG-IN: RT; PASSWORD: chosen by RT). Note: Log-in and password information
     must not be shared among users (e.g., LOG-IN: A Crew; PASSWORD: shared by A
     Crew).
     8.4.5.6. The DALR must only be used for accessing and editing recordings made with
     the DALR equipment. The computer workstations must not be used for any other
     purpose.
     8.4.5.7. No other programs and/or software packages are to be loaded and/or executed on
     any of the DALR system components.
     8.4.5.8. Profile access shall be restricted as follows:
        8.4.5.8.1. System Administrator - AO staff and Airfield Systems personnel only.
        8.4.5.8.2. Organizer - 7-level AO personnel or above.
        8.4.5.8.3. Reconstruct - 5-level AO personnel or above.
        8.4.5.8.4. Monitor - All AO personnel.
 90                                                AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


8.5. Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS). Define procedures and conditions for activation
in the AOI. Limit agencies with two-way telephones to the control tower, AM (or agency
responsible for secondary crash net as required), fire department, and the medical center.
Additional agencies may have receive-only capability. The tower PCAS should have a visual
system indicating when each two-way party on the PCAS picks up the handset. If monitor
capability exists, CCTLRs must identify procedures for checking the monitor PCAS in an LOP.
During real-world emergencies, trainees may only activate the PCAS if the trainer/monitor has
the capability to monitor and transmit over the PCAS.
   8.5.1. When mobile/temporary facilities are operated and circumstances make installation of
   a PCAS impractical, establish an alternate system and procedures for emergency response
   and notification. Include these procedures in an LOP.
8.6. Land Mobile Radios (LMR). Each LMR system supporting ATC and aerodrome
operations must terminate in the control tower console if enough transmitter and receiver
selection switches and speakers are available.
   8.6.1. Control towers with digital LMRs will establish an LMR net ―Tower Talk Group‖
   dedicated for use between vehicle operators and ATC, solely for the purpose of operating on
   the CMA.
   8.6.2. In the event that a Tower Talk Group cannot be established, CCTLRs must establish
   procedures to eliminate unnecessary transmissions (background noise) in an LOP.
8.7. Airfield Lighting Systems.
   8.7.1. Equip the control tower with the capability to operate airport lighting systems and
   visual aids. Name an agency responsible and define procedures in an LOP for operating the
   airport lighting when the tower closes. Note: Where pilot controlled lighting systems are
   installed, establish a letter of agreement, as applicable.
   8.7.2. DELETED
   8.7.3. DELETED
8.8. Multiple Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) Facilities:
   8.8.1. ILS facilities installed on intersecting or parallel runways may operate simultaneously,
   provided the ILS facilities operate on separate, non-interfering frequencies and an operational
   requirement for simultaneous operation exists. Verify noninterference by FAA flight
   inspection.
   8.8.2. ILS facilities at opposite ends of the same runway must have an interlock to prevent
   simultaneous operation. Assign distinctly different identifier codes.
       8.8.2.1. If the facilities are on common frequencies, assume interference (both glide
       slope and localizer). Do not disable the interlock to allow simultaneous operation.
       8.8.2.2. If the facilities are on discrete non-interfering frequencies and weather is Visual
       Meteorological Conditions (VMC), personnel may bypass the interlock to allow
       simultaneous localizer and or glide slope operations to accommodate facility installation,
       maintenance restoration, preventive maintenance, or flight inspection. If a flight
       inspection discovers interference between localizers and documents the location of
       interference, permit simultaneous localizer radiation during VMC weather and issue a
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                           91


       NOTAM that restricts the facility to the in-tolerance portion of the ILS signal. For
       example: "RUNWAY 32 LOCALIZER UNUSABLE INSIDE MM or 1.5 DME."
       8.8.2.3. Specify conditions for bypassing interlocks in an LOP with maintenance.
   8.8.3. The CCTLR of the facility responsible for NAVAID status must set up procedures to
   verify the operational status of the inactive ILS, to include standby transmitters of each
   operating system, at least once daily during a low density traffic period.
   8.8.4. Maintenance personnel must get ATC approval before making radiation checks on the
   inactive ILS.
8.9. ILS Equipment Requirements for Operation. Loss of transmitter or monitor redundancy
of either subsystem does not affect the category. Instructions concerning temporary RSI outages
in paragraph 7.21 also apply. If the localizer Far Field Monitor (FFM) becomes inoperative on a
Category II system, ensure Airfield Management sends a NOTAM downgrading the ILS to
Category I until repair of the FFM. Temporary bypass of the FFM does not affect Category I
systems.
8.10. Automated ATC Systems.
   8.10.1. MAJCOM ATCALS OPR is the authoritative source for the implementation,
   operation, and maintenance of the automated ATC systems they support and maintain (e.g.,
   Programmable Indicator Data Processor [PIDP], Simulation and Integration of Ground,
   Network, and Air Links [SIGNAL], etc.). Operator Manuals and Version Description
   Documents (VDDs) are directive in nature.
       8.10.1.1. CCTLRs must review each PIDP/Flight Data System (FDS) VDD to determine
       any operational or procedural impact and, when necessary, issue a facility directive
       describing the functional or procedural changes.
       8.10.1.2. Prior to operational use of a new program update, the PIDP Performance
       Evaluation Test (PET) must be accomplished indicating the date and individuals
       performing the tests. If any portion of the test fails, do not initialize the new program
       until MAJCOM ATCALS OPR has authorized its use.
   8.10.2. The FAA is the authoritative source for the security and software maintenance of the
   ATC systems they support (e.g., DTAS, ETVS, DVRS, etc.). System Technical Instructions
   are directive in nature. Prior to operational use of a new program update, accomplish the
   applicable test plan, indicating the date and individuals performing the tests.
   8.10.3. Computer hardware, software programs, and databases used to provide operational
   ATC services are mission and life critical resources. Do not tamper with, alter, or use these
   resources for other than their intended purposes. Load only authorized software programs
   provided by the system software manager. All personnel share the responsibility for
   protecting these resources.
   8.10.4. Immediately withdraw from service any ATC computer resource suspected of
   malfunctioning due to tampering, abuse or introduction of unauthorized programs (e.g.,
   software viruses, etc.). Physically disconnect all interface connections to other computer
   systems and maintain the suspect computer or software for analysis. Notify the FAA/DoD
   support personnel and AOF/CC for submittal to MAJCOM ATCALS OPR.

  8.10.5. Digital Terminal Automation Systems (DTAS).
     8.10.5.1. Operational Use.
        8.10.5.1.1. Do not use STARS data when the system is released to maintenance.
        8.10.5.1.2. Verify and document the operational status of all DTAS sub-systems
        daily. Retain documentation IAW 7.1.5.5.5. above.
        8.10.5.1.3. Advise affected facilities when STARS equipment will not be operational
        at normal startup time, when it fails, is shut down, resumes operation, or when inter-
        facility data transfer (IFDT) is lost/regained.
     8.10.5.2. Data Entries. Facility directives must prescribe the use of the scratch pad and
     the specific responsibility for System Status Area (SSA) entries to include current ATIS
     alpha character, current general system information and system altimeter setting.
     8.10.5.3. Display Data.
        8.10.5.3.1. When a malfunction causes repeated discrepancies of 300 feet or more
        between the automatic altitude readouts and pilot reported altitudes, inhibit the
        automatic altitude report (Mode C) display until the malfunction has been corrected.
        8.10.5.3.2. Display Mode C on untracked (unassociated) targets within each
        controller's area of responsibility by setting the altitude filters to encompass all
        altitudes within the controller's jurisdiction. Set the upper limits no lower than 1,000
        feet above the highest altitude for which the controller is responsible. In those
        stratified positions, set the upper and lower limit to encompass at least 1,000 feet
        above and below the altitudes for which the controller is responsible. When the
        position's area of responsibility includes down to the airport field elevation, the
        facility must set the lower altitude filter limit to encompass the field elevation, so that
        provisions of FAAO JO 7110.65 Chapter 2, and Chapter 5 may be applied. CCTLRs
        may authorize the temporary suspension of this requirement when target clutter is
        excessive.
     8.10.5.4. Automation Program Changes.
        8.10.5.4.1. NAAMs must review all applicable documentation issued by the
        FAA/DoD support facility pertaining to changes in their automated system and
        database to determine any operational or procedural impact. NAAMs must notify
        facility CCTLRs and Chief of Maintenance of any changes that impact operations or
        procedures.
            8.10.5.4.1.1. When necessary, coordinate any procedural, and airspace change(s)
            with the ARTCC.
                8.10.5.4.1.1.1. DELETED
            8.10.5.4.1.2. NAAMs must coordinate functional changes with the host ARTCC
            requiring modification of inter-facility adaptation.
            8.10.5.4.1.3. DELETED
            8.10.5.4.1.4. Facilities without a dedicated NAAM or civilian equivalent must
            establish procedures in an LOP for effectively managing automation program

            changes with the FAA, DoD, or HN facilities.
            8.10.5.4.1.5. If the STARS facility CCTLR has determined the use of the satellite
            airport database feature containing emergency airport data be available for
            controller use, NAAMs must complete the following tasks:
               8.10.5.4.1.5.1. NAAMs must validate the following items listed in TI 6191-
               409; STARS FSL TCW/TDW Operator‘s Manual, paragraph 7.2.; using the
               website, http://avnwww.jccbi.gov/datasheet/; or Flight Information
               Publications (FLIP).
                 8.10.5.4.1.5.1.1. Airport/heliport elevation (in feet).
                 8.10.5.4.1.5.1.2. Longest runway or helipad identified.
                 8.10.5.4.1.5.1.3. Longest runway length (in feet) (n/a to heliports).
                 8.10.5.4.1.5.1.4. Longest runway width (in feet) (n/a to heliports).
                 8.10.5.4.1.5.1.5. Longest runway/heliport composition.
                 8.10.5.4.1.5.1.6. Universal Communications frequency.
                 8.10.5.4.1.5.1.7. Pilot controlled lighting availability.
               8.10.5.4.1.5.2. NAAMs must verify the facilities STARS satellite airport
               database no later than the 10th of each month. This may be accomplished in
               conjunction with STARS monthly checks, but must be completed no later than
               the 10th of each month. Incorporate appropriate procedures into NAAM OI
               and monthly checklists. If no discrepancies are noted, document the findings
               in a monthly report. State that the monthly airport/heliport information
               contained in the facility‘s DAAS database has been verified and is accurate as
               of the date indicated. Include the radar facility CCTLR or civilian equivalent
               as an addressee for distribution and retain a copy on file for one year.
               8.10.5.4.1.5.3. If the monthly database verification has noted discrepancies,
               NAAMs shall submit an Adaptation Change Request (ACR) to the OSF no
               later than the 10th of the month. Document in a monthly report that the
               monthly airport/heliport information contained in the facility‘s DAAS
               database has been verified and inaccuracies have been identified as of the date
               indicated. Include details in the monthly report specifying when software
               updates are expected from the OSF. Include the radar facility CCTLR as an
               addressee for distribution and retain a copy on file for one year.
        8.10.5.4.2. NAAMs must ensure, as a minimum, the three latest builds of software
        and associated documentation, to include adaptation, are available.
     8.10.5.5. Automatic Acquisition/Termination Areas.
        8.10.5.5.1. Facility CCTLRs must:
            8.10.5.5.1.1. Establish automatic acquisition areas for arrivals and over-flights at
            ranges permitting auto-acquisition of targets prior to the ARTCC/STARS-to-
            STARS automatic handoff area when the center is in the radar data processing
            mode.
94                                               AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


            8.10.5.5.1.2. Coordinate with adjacent automated facilities to ensure that
            computer handoffs will be initiated only after the aircraft is within their facility's
            automatic acquisition area. Where this is not feasible due to airspace assignment,
            facility directives must require use of an appropriate procedure specified in
            FAAO JO 7110.65 to confirm the identity of all aircraft handed off prior to auto-
            acquisition.
            8.10.5.5.1.3. Establish automatic acquisition areas for departing aircraft one mile
            or less from the runway end.
            8.10.5.5.1.4. Establish automatic termination areas for arriving aircraft one mile
            or less from the runway threshold or, at satellite airports, the minimum radar
            coverage range/altitude, whichever is greater.
            8.10.5.5.1.5. Identify which operating position is responsible for determining if
            automatic acquisition of a departure track has occurred in an LOP. Note: This is
            intended for operations where automatic acquisition responsibility could be
            confused, e.g., uncontrolled airports within a single sector or between different
            radar sectors that serve the same airport.
     8.10.5.6. Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) and Conflict Alert (CA).
        8.10.5.6.1. Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW)/ Low Altitude Alert System
        (LAAS). Radar facilities that have MSAW/LAAS capabilities must set
        MSAW/LAAS requirements in accordance with AFI 11-230.
        8.10.5.6.2. CCTLRs must ensure that aural test of the MSAW speakers located in the
        operational positions are included as part of the equipment checklist required during
        each shift. The purpose of this inspection is to ensure the aural alarm is functioning
        and audible to the appropriate operational personnel.
        8.10.5.6.3. When their continued use would adversely impact operational priorities,
        CCTLRs may temporarily inhibit the MSAW, the approach path monitor portion of
        MSAW, and/or the CA functions. Except when equipment or site adaptation
        problems preclude these functions from being used, a brief written report must be sent
        to the MAJCOM OPR for ATC whenever they are inhibited. A copy of the report
        must be forwarded to HQ AFFSA.
        8.10.5.6.4. CCTLRs are authorized to inhibit CA at specific operating positions if an
        operational advantage exists.
        8.10.5.6.5. Utilize the most current MSAW Database.
     8.10.5.7. Magnetic Variation of Video Maps/GEO Maps at STARS Facilities. CCTLRs,
     in coordination with TERPS and the NAAM, must ensure that the magnetic variation of
     radar video maps/geo maps, MSAW, Digital Terrain Maps (DTM) and radar site settings
     coincide. The magnetic variation must be verified annually and a change of two degrees
     or more requires accomplishing/recompiling the affected map(s). Note: The video map
     is the primary reference for maintaining radar antenna alignment.
     8.10.5.8. MSAW DTM Updates. Updates to DTM maps will be provided for each site
     through their supporting OSF. Note: Requests for new or recompiled DTMs requires
     approximately ten weeks to build and deliver.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                            95


     8.10.5.9. Mode C Intruder (MCI) Alert Parameters. Use the nominal value of parameters
     specified in the appropriate NAS Configuration Management Document and Site
     Program Bulletins for the MCI Alert functions, except for the base altitude parameter, as
     specified in the paragraphs below, unless a waiver to adjust the base altitude parameter
     value is received from the MAJCOM OPR for ATC.
        8.10.5.9.1. MCI Alert base altitude must be set at any value between ground level
        and 500 feet AGL at the discretion of the facility CCTLR. Any instance of base
        altitudes above 500 feet AGL must be documented and forwarded to the MAJCOM.
        8.10.5.9.2. CCTLRs are authorized to temporarily adjust the MCI Alert base altitude
        at a sector (s)/position(s) when excessive MCI Alerts derogate the separation of IFR
        traffic. For the purpose of this section, temporary is considered to be of less than 4
        hours duration, not necessarily continuous, during any calendar day. The following is
        required when MCI base altitude is adjusted:
            8.10.5.9.2.1. Log each occurrence on the facility log when this procedure is being
            used, including the sector/position and temporary altitude.
            8.10.5.9.2.2. Documentation must be forwarded to the MAJCOM OPR for ATC
            if it is determined that a temporary adjustment of the MCI base altitude does not
            meet the needs of the sector/position.
        8.10.5.9.3. CCTLRs are authorized to inhibit the display of MCI Alert at specified
        sectors/position.
            8.10.5.9.3.1. CCTLRs must develop and publish procedures for CA suppression
            and use of Military Alert Suppression Zones (MASZ).
     8.10.5.10. Operational Mode Transition Procedures.
        8.10.5.10.1. CCTLRs must develop and maintain current detailed procedures in an
        LOP for transition to and from the various automated and non-automated modes of
        operation. Note: The architecture of STARS allows for different operational modes
        during display component failures. For example, system component failure could
        result in positions within the same facility operating in a non-automated mode with
        reduced functionality. Another example, a system component failure could result in
        positions within the same facility operating in Emergency Service Level (ESL) or
        Full Service Level (FSL) mode. Facilities are encouraged to take advantage of this
        capability to minimize the impact of display system outages.
        8.10.5.10.2. The transition plans must include as a minimum:
            8.10.5.10.2.1. Transition decision authority; e.g., the individual responsible for
            making the transition decision.
            8.10.5.10.2.2. Specific transition procedures.
            8.10.5.10.2.3. Detailed checklists specifying the duties and the responsibilities for
            the Watch Supervisor and other appropriate positions. The checklist must
            include, as a minimum, the following information/procedures:
                8.10.5.10.2.3.1. Transition decision authority.
96                                               AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


                8.10.5.10.2.3.2. Coordination/notification    procedures    (intra-   and   inter-
                facility).
                8.10.5.10.2.3.3. Specific duties/responsibilities (including detection and
                resolution of potential conflicts).            Note:     Whenever possible,
                coordination/notification procedures and duties/responsibilities should be
                listed in the sequence in which they are to be accomplished.
     8.10.5.11. Radar Selection Procedures. CCTLRs must develop and maintain current
     detailed procedures for selection of radar sites in a LOP. Note: The architecture of
     STARS allows for the selection of up to 16 different radars including short range and
     long-range radars at each display. This could result in positions within the same facility
     working and receiving radar information from different radars. Facilities are encouraged
     to take advantage of this capability to minimize the impact of radar outages, blind areas,
     limited radar coverage, etc.
        8.10.5.11.1. The selection plans must include as a minimum:
            8.10.5.11.1.1. Radar selection decision authority; e.g., the individual responsible
            for making the radar selection decision.
            8.10.5.11.1.2. Specific radar selection procedures.
            8.10.5.11.1.3. Detailed checklists specifying the duties and the responsibilities for
            the watch supervisor and other appropriate positions. The checklist must include,
            as a minimum, the following information/procedures:
                8.10.5.11.1.3.1. Radar selection decision authority.
                8.10.5.11.1.3.2. Coordination/notification procedures (intra- and inter-
                facility). Specific duties/responsibilities (including detection and resolution of
                potential conflicts). Note: Whenever possible, coordination/notification
                procedures and duties/responsibilities should be listed in the sequence in
                which they are to be accomplished.
     8.10.5.12. Multi-Sensor Radar Operations. CCTLRs must develop detailed procedures
     for selection and use of multi-sensor radar operations. Note: The architecture of STARS
     allows for the use of multi-sensor radar coverage for the display presentation. This could
     result in positions within the same facility working in both single sensor slant range mode
     and multi-sensor mode. Facilities are encouraged to take advantage of this capability to
     minimize the impact of radar outages, blind areas, limited radar coverage, etc.
        8.10.5.12.1. Minimum procedures must include:
            8.10.5.12.1.1. Decision authority to use multi-sensor coverage: e.g., the
            individual responsible for making the decision.
            8.10.5.12.1.2. Specific multi-sensor radar procedures.
            8.10.5.12.1.3. Detailed checklists specifying the duties and the responsibilities for
            the watch supervisor and other appropriate positions. The checklist must include,
            as a minimum, the following information and procedures:
                8.10.5.12.1.3.1. Decision authority to use multi-sensor radar coverage.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                            97


                8.10.5.12.1.3.2. Coordination/notification   procedures    (intra-   and   inter-
                facility).
                8.10.5.12.1.3.3. Specific duties/responsibilities including detection and
                resolution of potential conflicts such as transition from a 3 mile separation
                single-sensor environment, to a 5 mile separation multi-sensor environment.
                Note:      Whenever possible, coordination/notification procedures and
                duties/responsibilities should be listed in the sequence in which they are to be
                accomplished.
     8.10.5.13. Single Site Coverage Operations. Facilities may adapt all sort boxes utilizing
     radar separation defined in FAAO JO 7110.65, Chapter 5, Section 5.
        8.10.5.13.1. This adaptation may be used provided:
            8.10.5.13.1.1. A significant operational advantage will be obtained using single
            site coverage. Consideration must be given to such aspects as terminal interface,
            radar reliability, etc.; and appropriate procedures are identified in a LOP. As a
            minimum the LOP must:

     targets when long range radar is malfunctioning, released to maintenance, or out-of–
     service (OTS):
        8.10.5.14.1. CCTLRs shall designate facility watch supervisors to notify automation
        personnel and/or radar maintenance personnel to take off line any radar site that is out
        of service or released for maintenance.
        8.10.5.14.2. If automation personnel or radar maintenance personnel are not
        immediately available to disable/take off line the radar site, the CCTLR may
        designate in a facility operating instruction for the watch supervisor to use STARS
        keyboard entry located in FAA TI 6191.409/TI 6191.410 to exclude the radar track
        data and RTQC reporting until automation/maintenance personnel arrive.
        8.10.5.14.3. An entry shall be made in the daily events log stating that the sensor was
        taken off line/data was excluded and when returned to service.

          8.10.6.2.2. Current 15 and 60 NM MSAW charts and data.
          8.10.6.2.3. Reflection discrimination data, if used.
          8.10.6.2.4. Low Altitude Alerting System (LAAS) data products for TPX-42/980B.
          8.10.6.2.5. LAAS data products for TPX-42-only versions of Digital Bright Radar
          Indicator Tower Equipment (DBRITE).
8.11. Radar Mapping Equipment. The minimum radar mapping capability for commissioning
an approach control service is a dual video mapper, adequate map overlay (if available), or
computer-generated display. Note: AN/GPA-134 Video Mapper meets the dual video mapper
requirement.
   8.11.1. Do not use grease pencil markings, plastic tape, compass rose grid lines, range marks
   or other innovations in place of an adequate map overlay, video map, or computer generated
   display.
   8.11.2. If map overlays are available and coincidental with a flight inspected video map
   presentation, they do not need to be flight-inspected.
   8.11.3. DTAS Maps.
      8.11.3.1. The designated NAAM must coordinate with DoD OSF to create and maintain
      video maps as directed by the CCTLR.

      8.11.4.1. Prior to installation, a designated representative must ensure current accurate
      data was used during the building process of digital video maps. Quality checking and
      comparing the source document data with the map data print out sheet can accomplish
      this. Ensure that the data used to build the map agrees with the data found on the source
      document. CCTLRs must certify completion of the quality measure by signing a file
      copy of the map data printout sheet.
      8.11.4.2. The CCTLR must ensure that video maps are created, uploaded, and
      maintained. Ensure locally generated MVA maps are verified against the current
      MAJCOM approved MVA chart before operational installation in the facility.
      8.11.4.3. CCTLRs must coordinate video map source information annually with TERPS
      personnel.
      8.11.4.4. Procedures.
          8.11.4.4.1. Ensure primary and backup designated airspace map and your unit's most
          critical maps are programmed and placed on separate slim line/circuits.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                             99


           8.11.4.4.2. Designate one position on the slim line panel as the maintenance test map.

                                           Chapter 9

                            CONTROL TOWER OPERATIONS

9.1. Light Gun Operations.
   9.1.1. Attach AFVA 13-221, Control Tower Light Signals, or card listing the color codes and
   meanings contained in FAAO JO 7110.65, Chapter 3, Section 2 to each light gun.
   9.1.2. If equipment allows, adjust each gun to give a red light when turned on.
   9.1.3. Do not beam signals through sunshades.
   9.1.4. Light gun operational checks must be accomplished at least once per day and when
   practical with aircraft or vehicles.
9.2. Takeoff or Landing Direction Determination. In accordance with FAAO JO 7110.65,
Chapter 3, Section 5, control tower personnel determine the runway in use, unless procedures in
an LOP delegate this function to another agency.
   9.2.1. Coordinate with terminal radar facilities before changing the runway in use.
   9.2.2. Notify the terminal radar facility, AM, base weather facility, and ARTCC (if
   appropriate) when the runway change is complete.
9.3. Control of Ground Traffic in CMAs. Specific ATC approval is required prior to entry
into CMA, as defined in the AOI.
9.4. Wind Limitations on Control Towers. The base civil engineer must make a structural
evaluation of the control tower to determine the maximum wind velocity the tower can safely
withstand. Make the evaluation a permanent part of control tower real estate records. The
OG/CC establishes a maximum safe wind velocity for control tower operations. The maximum
safe wind velocity and control tower evacuation plans must be incorporated in the AOI.
9.5. Functional Use of Certified Tower Radar Display (CTRD). In addition to criteria
established in FAAO JO 7110.65, MAJCOMs may authorize the use of the tower radar displays
to ensure separation between successive departures, between arrivals and departures, and
between over-flights and departures within the surface area for which the tower has
responsibility only if:
   9.5.1. There is no additional airspace delegated to the tower.
   9.5.2. Tower local controllers receive radar training and certification commensurate with
   their radar duties. Items/tasks trained in local control PCGs and documented in the Career
   Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) must satisfy these requirements.
   9.5.3. An LOP exists with the IFR facility having control jurisdiction, clarifying the
   additional functions tower is authorized to perform. The LOP must outline:
       9.5.3.1. The process for a transition to non-radar procedures or the suspension of
       separation authority in the event of a radar outage. Procedures must not impair the local
       controller's ability to satisfy responsibilities regarding the aircraft operating on the
       runways or within the surface area for which the tower has responsibility.
 102                                              AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


       9.5.3.2. Procedures for giving and receiving radar handoffs or point-outs that do not
       impair the local controller's ability to satisfy responsibilities regarding the aircraft
       operating on the runways or within the surface area for which the tower has
       responsibility.
       9.5.3.3. Procedures for ensuring radar separation do not require the tower to provide
       radar vectors.
   9.5.4. Operational applications of certified tower radar displays other than those outlined
   above require HQ AFFSA approval.
   9.5.5. CCTLRs may determine, on a case-by-case basis, if the DBRITE maintenance
   indicator or the STARS supplemental display is adequate to support operations during short-
   term outages. Do not use the DBRITE maintenance indicator or the STARS supplemental
   display on a permanent basis.
9.6. Wear of Sunglasses in Control Towers. Do not wear polarizing or photo activated
darkening system type sunglasses while performing ATC duties.
9.7. Protection of 360 Overhead Pattern. Locations that use the overhead pattern must
develop local procedures and coordinate ATC/aircrew requirements to protect the overhead
pattern. Procedures and coordination requirements must be published in an LOP and AOI. Such
procedures must not restrict the departing, missed approach, or go-around aircraft to a point or
altitude that, once it crosses the departure end of the runway, compromises TERPS obstacle
clearance or IFR clearance. Published (flight inspected) IFR TERPS procedures, including
missed approach instructions, must not be restricted to protect the VFR/360 overhead pattern.
Where the AOI contains specific climb-out instructions to protect the overhead pattern,
controllers may use the phrase "EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMBOUT" for locally assigned
aircraft only.
9.8. Tower Equipment Requirements. Appropriate to assigned mission functions; provide
each control tower with the following equipment:
   9.8.1. DELETED
   9.8.2. Flight progress strip holders.
   9.8.3. A landline system that includes an intercom between positions within the facility.
   9.8.4. Radio receiver and transmitter controls, and consoles.
   9.8.5. Tower radar display.
   9.8.6. Weather dissemination and display equipment.
   9.8.7. Two wind direction and speed indicators.
   9.8.8. NAVAID remote status indicators (where applicable).
   9.8.9. Tower and radar coordination system.
   9.8.10. Two air traffic control light guns.
   9.8.11. Two pair of binoculars.
   9.8.12. Airfield lighting control.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                            103

9.9. USAF VFR Tower Operations Within Class C Airspace.
   9.9.1. When conditions require USAF VFR towers to operate within Class C airspace, the
   following minimum provisions are required for providing VFR tower services and must be
   covered in an LOP with the servicing radar agency:
      9.9.1.1. Tower surface area must be defined.
      9.9.1.2. Tower controllers may provide transit authorization of the surface area in
      accordance with FAAO JO 7110.65. When approving surface area transit requests, tower
      controllers must use phraseology for operational requests in accordance with FAAO JO
      7110.65, IFR surface area transitions will remain under the control of the servicing radar
      facility.
      9.9.1.3. Tower and radar coordination procedures for arrivals must be developed in
      accordance with paragraph 7.13 of this instruction.
   9.9.2. USAF VFR towers, located within Class C airspace, are authorized and may provide
   the following services within their surface area:
      9.9.2.1. Standard separation between successive departures and between arrivals and
      departures.
      9.9.2.2. Visual separation, wake turbulence separation and traffic advisories/alerts
      between IFR and VFR aircraft.
      9.9.2.3. Mandatory traffic advisories/alerts between aircraft in the tower‘s surface area.
9.10. Aircraft Arresting Systems. Where the Air Force is responsible for control tower
services, an LOP must define the following:

   9.10.5. Responsibilities concerning use of aircraft arresting systems.
   9.10.6. A training program to include the location, capabilities, and procedures for all
   installed arresting systems.       Note:     The OG/CC may establish multiple system
   priorities/configuration to meet local operational requirements.
9.11. Restricted Runway Operations. CCTLRs must develop procedures to warn controllers
when vehicles and personnel are on the runway or flight operations to a runway are restricted.
For example: Obstruct view of wind indicators by physically placing signs over them or other
automated methods using AFAS or other automated wind displays.
9.12. Standardized Taxi Routes (STRs). USAF controllers may issue Standardized Taxi
Routes (STRs) to DoD base-assigned aircraft only, provided all of the following conditions are
met:
9.12. (USAFE)Calculated Take-off Time (CTOT). Unless local agreements dictate otherwise,
to comply with European Flow Control restrictions, tower controllers will not issue clearances
allowing aircraft to depart more than 5 minutes before or 10 minutes after assigned CTOT. The
OG/CC should consider this CTOT compliance responsibility when establishing local aircraft
operating priorities.
   9.12.1. The reduced instructions do not permit aircraft to cross any runway(s).
   9.12.2. The required operational risk assessment has been accomplished.
   9.12.3. The procedures are clearly defined in a base AOI and only in a LOP by exception.

                                           Chapter 10

                                   RADAR OPERATIONS

10.1. Radar Use.
   10.1.1. USAF ATC radar systems may be used for:
      10.1.1.1. Surveillance of aircraft to assure the effective use of airspace.
      10.1.1.2. Vectoring aircraft to provide separation and radar navigation.
      10.1.1.3. Vectoring aircraft to final approach.
      10.1.1.4. Vectoring aircraft to the airport of intended landing.
      10.1.1.5. Monitoring instrument approaches.
      10.1.1.6. Providing assistance to pilots of aircraft in distress.
      10.1.1.7. Conducting precision or surveillance approaches.
      10.1.1.8. Air Base Defense
          10.1.1.8.1. If a requirement exists, terminal ATC radar facilities perform radar
          surveillance functions to support early warning or ensure safe passage of friendly
          aircraft. Describe controller priorities, procedures, coordination requirements, and
          areas of responsibilities in an LOP.
      10.1.1.9. STARS facility CCTLRs must determine the need to use the satellite airport
      database feature containing emergency airport data. The use of this feature requires
      monthly database validation by qualified automation personnel to ensure correct data is
      contained in the STARS system. Include applicable procedures in facility OI. Note:
      Radar Ready Reference Files (RRF) may be used as a supplement for the STARS satellite
      airport database.
          10.1.1.9.1. STARS facility CCTLRs must develop alternate procedures to advise
          pilots the satellite airport database is unverified if the automation personnel have not
          completed the verification process by the 10th day of each month. Procedures must
          include the phrase: ―AIRPORT DATA UNVERIFIED.‖
          10.1.1.9.2. If STARS facility CCTLR determines the STARS satellite airport
          database will not be used, state restrictions in facility OI.
   10.1.2. A facility may remote a radar operated by non-ATC agencies and use it for ATC
   purposes if the radar is satisfactorily flight checked according to AFMAN 11-225_IP, U.S.
   Standard Flight Inspection Manual . The non-ATC agency must not alter radar information
   furnished to the ATC facility without prior notification.
   10.1.3. A controller provides radar service when they have a usable target and determine that
   presentation and equipment performance are satisfactory.
      10.1.3.1. A usable target is one where a return is not missed on more than two
      consecutive scans along the entire airway/route or arrival/departure control routes for
      which radar service is provided. For surveillance approaches, a return should be seen on
 106                                              AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


       every scan from the final approach fix to the missed approach point. Note: For
       automated radar systems, consult system specific technical manuals and FAAO JO
       7110.65, Chapter 5, Section 1. (Not applicable to STARS locations)
10.2. AN/TPX-42 Strapping. Normally strap the AN/TPX-42 1,000' higher than the transition
altitude. The negative 1,000' altitude factor applied between the point of strapping and the point
of applying local altimeter correction is an inherent part of the signal-processing chain. At
locations with low transition altitudes (below 10,000'), strap the TPX-42 2,000' above the
transition altitude. This will reduce the number of incorrect altitude read-outs below the
transition altitude during periods of low altimeter settings.
   10.2.1. Do not use AN/TPX-42 altitude read-outs for separation between the transition
   altitude and the transition level. During periods of low altimeter settings (between 28.92 and
   27.92), altitude read-outs may be unreliable at altitudes within 1,000' below the transition
   altitude.
   10.2.2. Facilities with PIDP equipment do not require strapping.
10.3. Range Azimuth Beacon Monitor (RABM).
   10.3.1. CCTLRs must provide written guidance (in the form of a facility LOP) for use of the
   AN/TPX-49A during equipment checks and when verifying beacon range accuracy before
   providing secondary radar-only service during temporary primary radar outage conditions or
   when secondary radar service is provided outside the coverage of primary radar. Continually
   display the AN/TPX-49A generated target to verify system accuracy whenever primary radar
   is inoperative and secondary radar is in use. If using a code other than 6666, ensure
   maintenance sets the displayed altitude to greater than 60,000 feet (Flight Level 600) to
   prevent erroneous TCAS alerts to TCAS-equipped aircraft.
   10.3.2. Beacon targets may be displaced at a slightly greater range than their respective
   primary returns when desirable and equipment supports this function. Issue a facility
   directive specifying the standard relationship between primary returns and the beacon control
   slash of secondary returns when beacon displacement is elected. The maximum allowable
   displacement is 1/2 mile applied in 1/4-mile increments.
       10.3.2.1. For STARS locations the maximum allowable beacon target displacement
       which may be specified by the facility CCTLR is ¼ mile applied in 1/8 mile increments.
   10.3.3. Continually display the AN/TPX-49A generated target to verify system accuracy
   when secondary radar service is provided outside the coverage of primary radar.
10.4. Radar Reflectors for Precision Approach Radar (PAR).
   10.4.1. The outage of one bracketing reflector, or the outage of the centerline reflector when
   a single centerline reflector is being used, does not make the PAR unusable provided a
   suitable alternate method of runway centerline reference is available (approach lights,
   runway lights, barrier poles, etc.). CCTLRs must determine which returns to use as a
   temporary replacement for the bracketing reflectors. Verify accuracy of the alternate
   references through local or formal flight inspection. After flight check determines accuracy,
   publish guidance for use in a facility directive.
   10.4.2. Moving Target Indicator (MTI) reflectors must be operational (refer to the
   appropriate technical order for the minimum number required) when conducting PAR
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                           107


   approaches using MTI radar. The outage of any one of these reflectors makes the PAR
   unusable in the MTI mode.
   10.4.3. The AN/GPN-22 and AN/TPN-25 do not use bracketing or touchdown reflectors;
   they rely on track reflectors to monitor track accuracy for each runway served. The PAR is
   unusable for a given runway if the system cannot track the corresponding reference reflector.
   If this condition occurs, the systems will flat-line the glideslope cursor. If the system can
   track the reference reflector, but the controller cannot view or manipulate track symbols, the
   system may still be used in the scan-only mode if it is flight checked and procedures are
   detailed in local directives.
10.5. Radar Glide Path and Course Information. Use the center of the radar target (track
symbol for phased array PARs) to determine when an aircraft exceeds the PAR safety limits.
Use minimum gain to provide the most accurate position information.
   10.5.1. The AN/GPN-22 and AN/TPN-25 use a computer tracking system. Local conditions
   and equipment performance may limit the use of this equipment to control aircraft without
   the aid of the tracking system (scan mode only). Commissioning and periodic flight
   inspections of these radar systems will identify their capabilities and limitations.
   10.5.2. During temporary loss or non-availability of the tracking symbology and the
   controller can verify the radar is otherwise operating normally, the controller may use scan
   only video to conduct radar approaches provided limitations and procedures are published in
   an LOP.
10.6. PAR Safety Zones.
   10.6.1. PAR Lower Safety Limit Zone. A PAR lower safety limit path ("B" cursor)
   originates between the end of the runway and a point not closer than 500 feet before the
   runway point of intercept (RPI) of the glide path. Where possible, "B" cursor origin should
   be at least 250 feet from the runway end. That area between the "B" cursor and the glide
   path is the safety zone.
      10.6.1.1. The "B" cursor extends upward at an angle one-half (0.5) of a degree lower
      than the commissioned glide path angle, and ends at an altitude of 250 feet below the
      established glide path intercept altitude.
          10.6.1.1.1. The ―B‖ cursor on the MPN-14K1 can only extend out approximately 6.5
          miles. If intercept altitude occurs further out than 6.5 miles, CCTLRs must establish
          local procedures to aid controllers in identifying this point.
      10.6.1.2. At some locations, the length of the ―B‖ cursor differs because of differences in
      glide path angles or intercepts altitudes for the two runways. When this occurs, use the
      longer "B" cursor length (termination point below the glide path). Using the common
      "B" cursor expedites use of PAR by reducing maintenance adjustments after a runway
      change and equipment turnaround.
      10.6.1.3. The AN/GPN-22 "B" cursor extends to the length of the "A" cursor. However,
      safety limits apply for go-around instructions only between the point on the "B" cursor
      250 feet below the established glide path intercept altitude and the normal termination
      point of the approach.
 108                                               AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


       10.6.1.4. A dashed electronic cursor displays the "B" cursor on the elevation portion of
       the PAR scope for each precision approach. If an equipment malfunction prevents
       display of the cursor, a suitable substitute may identify the lower safety limit zone.
   10.6.2. PAR Upper Safety Limit Zone. This zone is above the glide path. Its dimensions are
   the same as those established for the lower zone. The upper safety limit path starts at a point
   in space above the glide path and has the same geometrical relationship to the glide path as
   the lower path. The upper path rises at an angle one-half (0.5) of a degree greater than the
   commissioned glide path angle. There is no requirement to display the upper path on the
   scope.
   10.6.3. PAR Lateral Safety Limits. These limits refer to distances on the azimuth portion of
   the PAR scope. There is no requirement to display lateral safety zone limits on the
   radarscope; however, a drawing or table depicting lateral safe limits must be available at each
   PAR position. Table 10.1 Specifies PAR lateral safety limits and approximate displacement
   distances. The displacement distances are averages and actual distances will vary.
   Displacement distances for scan type radar are based on a maximum display range of 9 miles.
   The displacement relationship remains constant for tracking type radar, regardless of the
   display range selected (8, 15, or 20 miles). Use these distances as a guide for interpreting the
   precision radar displays.

10.7. Decision Height (DH). Mark the DH on the PAR azimuth-elevation zone paths that
represent the height above threshold (HATh) elevation approved for the runway in use. Use
grease pencil or fluorescent gummed cellophane tape to display the DH if not electronically
displayed (not applicable to GPN-22). Display only the DH for the runway in use (see Figure
10.1).

10.8. Use of Precision Approach Radar (PAR)
   10.8.1. A radar final controller must not accept more than one aircraft or flight conducting a
   PAR or ASR approach. Note: A standard formation flight conducting a PAR or ASR
   approach shall not exceed two aircraft.
   10.8.2. Monitor Instrument Final Approach Courses.
      10.8.2.1. In order to use PAR to monitor non-radar instrument approach courses, the
      PAR Runway Point of Intercept (RPI) must be within 250 feet of the ILS or MLS RPI,
      and the commissioned flight check angle of the PAR must be within two-tenths of a
      degree of the ILS or MLS commissioned glide slope angle. Additionally, the PAR final
      approach course must coincide with the NAVAID final approach course from the final
      approach fix to the runway. Where the capability exists, the OG/CC must determine if
      there is a requirement to monitor approaches at their locations in an LOP.
      10.8.2.2. A radar final controller must not monitor more than four aircraft. If units
      choose to monitor approaches using the PAR equipment, one of the following conditions
      must exist:
          10.8.2.2.1. The official weather is below basic VFR minima (1,000‘ ceiling and/or 3
          miles visibility).
          10.8.2.2.2. At night
          10.8.2.2.3. Upon request of the pilot.
 110                                              AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


       10.8.2.3. Where PAR serves a runway that has an ILS, MLS, or visual glide slope
       indicator, the glide-path, glide-slope angles and RPIs should coincide. An official flight
       inspection must determine coincidence. Where PAR, ILS, MLS, and visual glide slope
       indicators are not coincident, publish the deviation in the IFR Supplement. For example:
       RWY 30-PAR, ILS, and Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) glide-slopes are not
       coincidental.
       10.8.2.4. When the mission warrants simultaneous approach monitoring, the CCTLR
       must outline procedures in an LOP.
10.9. Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) Approach Procedures.
   10.9.1. An adequate reference to the runway centerline must be available on the ASR
   indicator. The video map is an adequate reference when the commissioning flight check
   establishes permanent echoes or targets. Facilities without a video map must have alignment
   reflectors to verify course accuracy. Use two runway bracket reflectors or a centerline
   runway reflector to verify alignment of an overlay (if available), cursor or compass grid line
   for ASR approaches. MTI reflectors must be operational when conducting ASR approaches
   using MTI radar when video maps are not available or when using MTI to determine runway
   centerline reference.
   10.9.2. Facilities must use a video map to depict the extended runway centerline. A map
   overlay (if available) may be used during map outages. Use the electronic cursor in an MPN-
   14 facility during a video map outage, if the cursor de-centering and bearing controls have
   protective covers.
   10.9.3. There is no requirement for bracketing reflectors or a video map to provide ASR
   approaches using the AN/TPN-19. The systems fixed, displayed runway cursor is based on a
   set geographic location in relation to the ASR antenna and meets reflector, video map and
   cursor requirements.
   10.9.4. Recommended altitudes for ASR approaches must be developed according to AFI
   11-230 and be immediately available at each RFC position and ASR indicators.
10.10. Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS).
   10.10.1. CCTLRS at STARS locations shall establish procedures in an LOP/LOI in the event
   of radar feed failures. Guidance shall include WS/SC actions for maintenance notification
   and STARS keyboard entries located in FAA TI 6191.409/6191.410 to exclude false radar
   track data to prevent false target returns.
   10.10.2. CCTLRs shall establish coordination procedures with radar maintenance personnel
   to determine realistic response times and maintenance actions.
10.11. Radar Performance Checks. Each radar controller is responsible for determining, on a
continuous basis, if the quality of their radar display and video fix accuracy is satisfactory for
ATC purposes.
   10.11.1. The radar performance check must be accomplished at least once each shift.
   10.11.2. Radar quality and performance are determined by comparing identified targets
   against data obtained during the commissioning flight check or by using minimum
   performance criteria determined jointly by maintenance and the CCTLR.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                             111


   10.11.3. Targets used for comparison checks should be generated by small aircraft, similar in
   size to those used during the commissioning flight check.
   10.11.4. CCTLRs must maintain commissioning flight check data and minimum
   performance reports for each radar sensor used to provide ATC services. This information
   must be made readily available for all radar controllers.
   10.11.5. CCTLRs at locations that use multi-site sensors/radars must ensure that each radar
   sensor used provides adequate radar and altitude coverage for the type of operations it will be
   used for.
   10.11.6. Automated ATC narrow-band radar systems must not be used for operational
   purposes unless they are operationally validated (certified) by ATCALS maintenance
   personnel. Non-validated radar sensors (e.g., failed or out of tolerance) must be inhibited
   from the system until validated for use. An entry must be made on AF IMT 3616 when the
   digitized radar system is validated for operational use and/or when a non-validated radar
   sensor is inhibited or restored to the operational system. Note: These procedures are not
   intended to be used during normal opening/shift change checklists, but are used when
   certifying or re-entering into service a radar system that was removed from service.
   10.11.7. Optimum Antenna Tilt. For deployable mobile radar systems, operate radar units
   with variable antenna tilt capability at the tilt angle prescribed by the official commissioning
   flight check or subsequent flight check data incorporated into the most recent ATCALS
   Evaluation Report.
10.12. Surveillance Antenna Operation in High Wind. Allow the antenna to free-wheel
whenever the forecasted/current wind exceeds the maximum defined in the system specific
technical orders and ATC conditions permit. CCTLRs must define maintenance notification
procedures, and define who is responsible for placing the antenna in the free-wheel mode in an
LOP.
10.13. Diverse Vector Area (DVA). The CCTLR must coordinate with TERPS and establish a
DVA (see FAAO JO 7110.65, Chapter 5 and AFI 11-230) before aircraft may be vectored below
the MVA/MIA while aircraft are executing a departure/climb-out instructions. A DVA provides
separation from obstacles in accordance with TERPS diverse departure criteria.
   10.13.1. When a DVA is established, CCTLRs must include in the facility OI:
       10.13.1.1. A complete description of the DVA, to include any restrictions and/or free
       vectoring areas. Note: Free vector areas are areas within a DVA in which random
       vectoring below the MVA/minimum IFR altitude (MIA) is authorized.
       10.13.1.2. Procedures for radar vectoring IFR departures below the MVA/MIA and
       within 3-5 NM of an obstacle, as applicable.
   10.13.2. Depict sectors (areas) and/or radar routes/corridors within which radar vectors are
   provided.
   10.13.3. Restrictions to a DVA must be incorporated in accordance with AFI 11-230.
   10.13.4. No IFR aircraft climbing within a DVA must be assigned an altitude restriction
   below the MVA/MIA.
 112                                               AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


   10.13.5. Headings must not be assigned beyond those authorized for DVA prior to reaching
   the MVA/MIA.
   10.13.6. For climb gradients in excess of 200 feet per nautical mile (FPNM), controllers are
   required to issue the specific climb gradient and obtain pilot concurrence prior to providing
   ATC navigational guidance on departure. Exception: For Obstacle Departure Procedures
   (ODP) and Standard Instrument Departure (SID) procedures, ATC personnel are not required
   to issue climb gradients in excess of 200 FPNM when the required climb gradient is
   published.
10.14. Designation of Sectors. The CCTLR develops airspace sectorization based on
predominant traffic flows, altitude strata and controller workload. Ensure no two controllers
provide service or advisories in the same airspace.
10.15. Multiple Radar Final Control (RFC) Requirement. The OG/CC specifies the Wing‘s
multiple RFC requirements (more than one RFC position) and ensures enough approaches are
flown to maintain controller proficiency. Detail the multiple RFC requirements in the AOI.
10.16. Radar Equipment Requirements. Appropriate to assigned mission functions, a radar
approach control or other terminal radar ATC facility has the following equipment:
   10.16.1. Flight Progress Boards.
   10.16.2. RVR equipment (for locations with CAT II/III ILS).
   10.16.3. A landline system that includes an intercom between positions within the facility.
   10.16.4. A radar display.
   10.16.5. Radio receiver and transmitter controls and consoles.
   10.16.6. Weather dissemination and display equipment.
   10.16.7. NAVAID remote status indicators (where applicable).
   10.16.8. Voice recorders and an adequate supply of recordable data media.
   10.16.9. Wind direction and speed indicators.
   10.16.10. Flight Data System (FDS), with a collocated clearance delivery position that has
   independent communications.
   10.16.11. Coordinator positions. Authorize independent coordinator positions when
   necessary due to traffic complexity.
   10.16.12. Secondary radar system.
   10.16.13. Video mapper.
   10.16.14. Battery operated emergency lighting systems or flashlights.
   10.16.15. UHF and VHF emergency alternate radio system.
   10.16.16. Radar and tower coordination system.
   10.16.17. Automated Radar Tracking System (STARS, PIDP, MEARTS, ARTS 3/A, etc.).
   10.16.18. Headsets.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                             113


10.17. PAR Associated Equipment Requirements. A readily observable and operational ASR
display must be available in the operations room at facilities providing PAR only service. At
locations where ASR displays are not available, a CTRD maintenance monitor or television
slaved from the tower CTRD meets the requirement. The ASR display will aid controllers
during radar hand-offs between approach control and PAR. When the ASR display is out of
service, PAR services may continue if the CCTLR establishes procedures in an LOP.
10.18. Turn-around for ATC Radar. CCTLRs must establish an LOP for notification of
personnel working in or around radar units during turn-around operations.
10.19. Non-Radar Board. (Not Applicable to Dobbins) Each radar facility (RFC excluded)
must maintain and utilize a current facility developed non-radar board. The following items
should be included, but not limited to:
   10.19.1. Transfer of control points.
   10.19.2. GPS coordinates (Latitude/Longitude) for significant points.
   10.19.3. Diverging radials table.
   10.19.4. Holding patterns (include applicable altitudes and maximum holding airspeed).
   10.19.5. Available NAVAIDS.
   10.19.6. Minimum IFR Altitude Chart.
   10.19.7. CCTLRs must coordinate non-radar board information annually with TERPS
   personnel.
10.20. FAA/USAF Contingency Plan Agreements. The purpose of an FAA Parent Facility
Contingency Plan, developed according to FAAO JO 1900.47, is to mitigate impact to the NAS
in the event of an ATC facility‘s loss of ability to provide ATC services. The FAA Parent
Facility Contingency Plan should address reciprocal support between USAF and FAA approach
control facilities to assume each other‘s en route/approach control services as much as feasible,
in the event of a contingency involving equipment failure. These agreements should also address
requirements for FAA assumption of USAF facility airspace, in the event of temporary facility
closure or a need to temporarily curtail operating hours, due to circumstances such as
deployments or critical staffing levels.
   10.20.1. The Air Traffic Services contingency plan authority is an agreement authorizing
   inter-facility cooperation to proceed with the contingency plan development. For USAF
   locations, the OG/CC must sign these agreements in lieu of the Facility-2 Air Traffic (AT)
   Manager and Facility-2 Airway Facilities Manager.
   10.20.2. The support facility Operational Capability Level (OCL) procedures should
   encompass each support facility's OCL site specific procedures, contain customized
   checklists and detailed data or procedures necessary to activate and support the parent facility
   contingency plan.
       10.20.2.1. The information contained in section 3, should incorporate a checklist tailored
       to each individual facility. Include detailed procedures (including non-radar, if required)
       for departures, arrivals and en route operations to/from the terminal area, adjacent areas
       and inter-facility coordination required to accomplish it.
114                                              AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


      10.20.2.2. The section labeled Information and/or Actions common to all facilities may
      contain general guidance that all facilities need in case of the parent facility's OCL
      declaration. Outline procedures for reporting to the Air Traffic Control System
      Command Center when the transfer control of airspace has been stabilized.
      10.20.2.3. Each procedures document contains administrative and operational data
      attachments needed to activate the contingency plan. Attachments include:
         10.20.2.3.1. Map of Assets. This is a geographical depiction of physical assets,
         frequency service volumes, etc. and is used as a tool for developing airspace
         divestment charts.
         10.20.2.3.2. Data Tables. Ensure this contains specific telephone, frequency,
         navigational facilities and other similar types of physical assets.
         10.20.2.3.3. Airspace Divestment Charts. Geographical depiction of airspace
         delegation derived from parent and support facility map of assets.
      10.20.2.4. Additional attachments including maps depicting departure and arrival routes
      are permitted, as long as detailed procedures are outlined within the actual plan (section
      3). Ensure requirements within Section 3 and the attachment match.
      10.20.2.5. Other important areas to include are:
         10.20.2.5.1. Facility Operating Hours (e.g., when will facilities not be available to
         participate in the contingency plan).
         10.20.2.5.2. The number of days the facility can sustain continuous operations (24
         hours, 7 days per week) before augmentation is required.
         10.20.2.5.3. A statement that USAF air traffic controllers are deployable assets and
         can be deployed at any time, affecting the terms of the agreement.
         10.20.2.5.4. Limitations of equipment (e.g., radar and radio coverage, control
         positions available, if any, and options for parent facility controllers to augment
         USAF staffing, and accepted impact on routine services.
         10.20.2.5.5. Due to the uncertain ties regarding automation capabilities, facilities
         should address the use of automated inter-facility handoff procedures and/or the use
         of manual handoff until automation capabilities are verified.
         10.20.2.5.6. Units must forward proposed support facility authority and support
         facility OCL procedures to MAJCOM for approval prior to implementation. The
         request for approval must be signed by the OG/CC (or equivalent) and must contain
         one of the following statements:
             10.20.2.5.6.1. Draft requirements (if approved) can be accomplished within
             existing resources.
             10.20.2.5.6.2. Additional (personnel, equipment, funds etc.) resources will be
             necessary.
             10.20.2.5.6.3. A mission impact statement (Will it affect the efficiency/aircraft
             movement of training mission aircraft at your base?).
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                     115


  10.20.3. Do not enter into the plan if:
     10.20.3.1. The support facility agreement is not written to a level that, stand alone,
     provides the tool to transition to/from the contingency plan.
     10.20.3.2. Entering into an agreement will require additional equipment or manpower
     that the facility is not funded for or currently do not have available. USAF units may
     support more than one parent facility. For example: An approach control could support
     two separate ARTCC facilities, or two USAF RAPCON facilities could mutually support
     a single ARTCC facility. Units must use caution when entering into more than one
     support facility agreement. Ensure support responsibilities do not overlap or override
     another plan in addition to units acting as a support facility.

                                            Chapter 11

                  SPECIAL OPS AND SUPPLEMENTAL PROCEDURES

11.1. Exercises. The AOF/CC must be briefed at least 48 hours in advance of any exercise or
inspection that involves AO personnel, facilities to include ATCALS, or airfield (i.e. Operational
Readiness Exercises [ORE], Operational Readiness Inspections [ORI] and Major Accident
Response Exercise [MARE]). The AOF/CC must approve, in advance, exercises that include
removing AO personnel to alternate facilities or to shelter areas. Consider traffic volume and
service limitations when coordinating these exercises.
   11.1.1. WS/SC must ensure ATC facility participation does not degrade services. WS/SC
   may interrupt or discontinue facility participation in any exercise if flight safety is in question
   or it interferes with the recovery of emergency aircraft.
   11.1.2. ATC personnel may wear gas masks in support of OREs/ORIs, consistent with Wing
   requirements, provided a non-masked safety observer is present. The safety observer must
   be facility rated and cannot be assigned to any position other than WS. The safety observer
   must have the authority to direct controllers to remove gas masks in the interest of flight
   safety. When an aircraft declares an emergency or is in distress, controllers in direct
   communications with the aircraft must remove the gas mask. Note: Controllers wearing a
   gas mask must be equipped with the Gas Mask Communication System Interface Equipment
   when actively controlling traffic (see paragraph 8.15). CCTLRs must establish procedures in
   an LOP.
11.2. Supervisor of Flying (SOF). When the SOF performs duties in an ATC facility, describe
details in an LOP. When advice is extremely technical, or when the SOF feels that relay of
information by the controller could cause an unacceptable delay, the SOF must coordinate with
the WS prior to using an ATC frequency to transmit directly to the affected aircraft. Instructions
should be limited to preventing a mishap. The SOF must not perform ATC functions or transmit
ATC instructions or clearances to an aircraft. A person who commandeers an ATC frequency
assumes responsibility for separation of aircraft.
11.3. Aircraft Priorities. The OG/CC establishes local aircraft operational priorities in the
AOI. Locally developed operational priorities must not take precedence over priorities listed in
FAAO JO 7110.65, Chapter 2, Section 1 and AFJI 11-204, Operational Procedures for Aircraft
Carrying Hazardous Materials.
11.4. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). USAF authority for establishing RSRS is
designated in FAAO JO 7110.65, Chapter 1, Section 1. Accordingly, MAJCOM A3s are
responsible for establishing RSRS criteria for their specific commands.
   11.4.1. RSRS criteria is based on aircraft characteristics, aircrew training requirements and
   the responsible air traffic controllers‘ ability to ensure application of established separation.
       11.4.1. (USAFE) RSRS standards do not apply to non-USAF, or non-US aircraft unless
       a LOA is signed between the host OG/CC and the non-USAF, or non-US aircraft unit
       commander (e.g., Det CC) and approved by the HQ USAFE Director of Operations,
       Strategic Deterrence, and Nuclear Integration (HQ USAFE/A3/10). The LOA must be
       coordinated/approved with 3AF/OD prior/ to OG/CC signature. The approval request for
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                              117


     HQ USAFE/A3/10 signature will be routed through HQ USAFE/A3CA and the HQ
     USAFE Standardization and Evaluation (HQ USAFE/A3TV) branch. Note: Aircrew or
     air traffic controllers may refuse RSRS when safety of flight may be jeopardized. In
     these cases, the appropriate separation standards published in FAAO 7110.65, or
     governing HN regulation shall be used.
     11.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) The OG/CC will ensure assigned military aircrew and
     supporting air traffic controllers are thoroughly familiar with authorized RSRS standards.
  11.4.2. Unit level application of RSRS must be developed by affected air traffic control
  personnel and user units, specifically outlined in either the base airfield operations instruction
  or a Wing operations letter, and approved by the MAJCOM prior to implementation.
     11.4.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS) is applicable to
     all non-formation aircraft except as outlined in this supplement. Note: For the purpose
     of applying RSRS, formation landing is defined as two aircraft crossing the threshold at
     the same time (i.e., Holding-hands).
     11.4.2.2. (Added-USAFE) RSRS may be applied to the following:
         11.4.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Full-stop behind a full-stop, low-approach, or touch-
         and-go.
         11.4.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Touch-and-go behind a touch-and-go or low-approach.
         11.4.2.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Low-approach behind a low-approach.
         11.4.2.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Low-approach behind a full-stop:
             11.4.2.2.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Fighter/attack aircraft. The succeeding aircraft
             will offset laterally as to not overfly the aircraft on the runway.
             11.4.2.2.4.2. (Added-USAFE) The succeeding C-130 must maintain at least 500
             feet lateral or vertical separation when overflying the C-130 on the runway.
     11.4.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Helicopter operations for RSRS will be according to AFI
     11-2HH-60V3, HH-60-Operations Procedures.
     11.4.2.4. (Added-USAFE) RSRS is not authorized when:
         11.4.2.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Either aircraft is an emergency.
         11.4.2.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Either aircraft is a heavy.
         11.4.2.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Either the succeeding or preceding aircraft is cleared
         for the option or a stop-and-go. Exception: RSRS is authorized when the succeeding
         aircraft is cleared for an option or a stop-and-go behind a low approach.
         11.4.2.4.4. (Added-USAFE) The runway condition reading (RCR) is less than 12 or
         braking action reports of less than ―FAIR‖ are reported.
     11.4.2.5. (Added-USAFE) The minimum RSRS authorized is:
         11.4.2.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Three thousand feet between same type fighter/attack
         aircraft (e.g., F-16 behind an F-16) during daylight hours. Note: Six thousand feet
         when reported braking action is ―FAIR.‖

           11.4.2.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Six thousand feet between:
              11.4.2.5.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Dissimilar fighter/attack aircraft (e.g., F-15
              behind an F-16).
              11.4.2.5.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Same type fighter/attack aircraft during night
              time hours.
              11.4.2.5.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Any landing (single aircraft or formation) behind
              a formation landing.
              11.4.2.5.2.4. (Added-USAFE) A formation landing behind a full stop.
              11.4.2.5.2.5. (Added-USAFE) A C-130 and another C-130 not in formation.
       11.4.2.6. (Added-USAFE) Weather must be at or above a 500 ft ceiling and 2,400
       meters visibility for nighttime RSRS operations.
11.5. Radar-in-Trail Recovery.
   11.5.1. Radar-in-trail recovery procedures must be coordinated through the AOF, Operations
   Group (and host nation, if required,) approved by the MAJCOM, and detailed in the AOI. If
   the FAA provides approach control services, procedures must be contained in an LOA and
   signed by all appropriate individuals. Procedures must address the following:
       11.5.1.1. Recovery procedures and notification requirements (to include flight lead
       coordination of trail recovery with ATC prior to taking spacing).
       11.5.1.2. Missed approach/break-out/go-around procedures.
       11.5.1.3. Lost communications procedures.
       11.5.1.4. Spacing requirement within/between flights.
       11.5.1.5. Radar-in-trail recoveries must not terminate in PAR or ASR approaches.
       11.5.1.6. Radar-in-trail recovery is limited to a maximum of four aircraft.
       11.5.1.7. Aircrews conducting radar-in-trail recoveries are responsible for their own
       separation between elements of their flight while on final for full-stop landings. To
       ensure appropriate departure separation, multiple practice radar in-trail approaches that
       do not terminate with a full-stop landing must be conducted only in VMC. During
       practice approaches in VMC conditions, after an executed low approach/landing, the
       flight is responsible for their own separation until ATC initiates flight split-ups for
       individual control.
11.6. Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft. FAAO JO 7610.4 and AFI 13-207, provides guidance
regarding unlawful seizure of aircraft. An LOP must define the base response to hijack or theft
attempts and identify a single base agency to receive ATC notification. In addition to procedures
mandated in FAAO JO 7610.4, ICAO Annexes, and host nation documents, ATCT
responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
   11.6.1. Immediately activating the primary crash alarm system, or notification via landline.
   11.6.2. Issuing current position information to fire/crash, security police, base rescue, etc.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                               119


   11.6.3. Assisting the on-scene commander by forwarding updated information and relaying
   any orders or instructions.
11.7. Min-Comm/Comm-Out. Departure/inbound procedures for minimum-communications
and communications-out operations must be established in the AOI and require MAJCOM
approval prior to implementation. Procedures that task or involve the FAA must be defined in an
LOA.
11.8. Night Vision Device (NVD) use in terminal airspace.
   11.8.1. NVDs must only be used as an aid for air traffic controllers to assist in maintaining
   air traffic situation awareness and airfield surveillance during periods of aircraft operations at
   airfields with reduced lighting configurations.
       11.8.1.1. NVDs must be binocular type and must not be affixed to any head strap, helmet
       or any other retention device.
       11.8.1.2. Minimum acceptable NVD binocular/tester configuration is available at:
       https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=
       OO-OP-AF-20-2-7&Filter=OO-OP-AF-20. NVDs other than those specified in the
       HQ AFFSA standard will require a waiver and a training package suitable to the
       particular model of NVD.
       11.8.1.3. Prior to using NVDs, controllers must complete all "Just-in-Time" training.
       Controllers may access this website from the address located in 11.8.1.2.
       11.8.1.4. ATC personnel must be trained in the proper use of NVDs. Identify NVD tasks
       on AF IMT 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS, with
       applicable Technical References (TR). Include tasks that reflect use of associated
       equipment.
11.9. Explosives Detection K-9 Teams.
   11.9.1. CONUS Locations, Alaska, Hawaii and Guam. ATC facilities will take the
   following actions if they receive a civil aircraft request for the location of the nearest
   explosives detection K-9 teams:
       11.9.1.1. Relay the pilot's request to the FAA Washington Operations Center, AEO-100,
       via telephone (DSN 851-3750 and Commercial 202-267-3333) providing the aircraft's
       identification and position.
       11.9.1.2. AEO-100 will provide the ATC facility with the nearest location. Have AEO-
       100 standby while relaying the information to the pilot.
       11.9.1.3. After determining the aircraft wishes to divert to the airport provided, the ATC
       facility will find out the estimated time of arrival and advise AEO-100.
       11.9.1.4. If a military installation has an explosives detection K-9 team, during
       emergency situations and with the concurrence of base officials, advise the pilot that such
       service is available.
   11.9.2. Overseas Locations. ATC facilities receiving a request from a military or civil
   aircraft must take action according to local resource protection plans and guidance received
   from local military authorities in accordance with host nation agreements.
 120                                                AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


11.10. Parachute Jump Operations.
   11.10.1. Define operational/procedural needs to conduct parachute jump operations in an
   LOP with parachute jump organizations or responsible individuals. As a minimum, the LOP
   should contain:
       11.10.1.1. The description and the location of the drop zone(s) and the conditions of use.
       11.10.1.2. The activity schedules.
       11.10.1.3. The maximum jump altitudes (Mean Sea Level).
       11.10.1.4. Notification procedures.
       11.10.1.5. Any other items pertinent to the needs of the ATC system and the users.
   11.10.2. Areas designated as permanent jump sites in an LOP may be used repeatedly to
   minimize coordination. Specific authorization or notification is still required, but not
   necessarily for each jump.
   11.10.3. To the extent possible, advise parachute jumping organizations or responsible
   individuals of known high traffic density areas or other airspace where parachuting may
   adversely impact system efficiency, such as IFR departure/arrival routes, airways, VFR
   flyways, military training routes, etc.
11.11. Prohibited/Restricted Areas. FAAO JO 7110.65, Chapter 9, Section 3 prescribes
separation requirements from special use and ATC assigned airspace. In recognition of the fact
that several prohibited/restricted areas are established for security reasons or to contain
hazardous activities not directly involving aircraft operations, provision is made for exempting
these areas from vertical and radar separation minima if the areas have been identified by facility
management. The intent in prescribing separation requirements from special use and ATC
assigned airspace is to establish a buffer between non-participating aircraft and aircraft
operations inside special use or ATC assigned airspace. As such, the buffer serves as an extra
safety margin in consideration of possible operational, procedural, or equipment variances.
Application of the separation prescribed in FAAO JO 7110.65 is not considered necessary
whenever the prohibited/restricted airspace does not contain aircraft operations because these
areas typically provide an internal buffer based upon the exact type of activity taking place. In
addition, instrument procedures protected areas cannot violate or penetrate SUA without meeting
criteria established in AFI 11-230. In making a determination to exempt specific areas, facility
managers must be guided by the following:
   11.11.1. Determine the exact nature of prohibited/restricted area utilization through direct
   liaison with the using agency.
   11.11.2. Coordinate with MAJCOM OPR for ATC during the analysis of area utilization.
   11.11.3. The following types of activity are examples of restricted area utilization which
   often will not require application of separation minima:
       11.11.3.1. Explosives detonation.
       11.11.3.2. Ground firing of various types.
       11.11.3.3. Drone and other unmanned aircraft flight operations.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                            121


       11.11.3.4. Aircraft operations associated with the above in a safety, observer, or
       command and control capacity only; e.g., the aircraft is not directly engaging in activity
       for which the airspace was designated and is operating under VFR.
   11.11.4. If area utilization varies between aircraft operations and other types of activity as
   described above, do not exempt the area from separation requirements unless a significant
   operational advantage can be obtained.
   11.11.5. Restricted airspace with the same number but different letter suffixes is considered
   to be separate restricted areas. Units may treat these types as one restricted area for the
   purpose of identifying areas for exemption from separation requirements in order to simplify
   application of separation minima unless a significant operational advantage can be obtained.
11.12. Reporting Laser Illumination of Aircraft. All ATC facilities must report unauthorized
laser illumination of aircraft incidents through the overlying approach control or ARTCC
facility. Terminal facilities shall include reported unauthorized laser illumination events on the
ATIS broadcast for one hour following the last report and include the following information:
   11.12.1. ZULU date and time of event.
   11.12.2. Call sign or aircraft registration number.
   11.12.3. Type aircraft.
   11.12.4. Nearest major city.
   11.12.5. Altitude.
   11.12.6. Location of event (latitude/longitude and/or fixed radial distance).
   11.12.7. Brief description of the event.
   11.12.8. Color.
   11.12.9. Direction of laser as reported by pilot.
   11.12.10. Any other pertinent information.
 122                                               AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


                                           Chapter 12

       PROCEDURES FOR ESTABLISHING VFR FLYING AREAS AND TRAFFIC
                              PATTERNS

12.1. VFR Traffic Patterns:
   12.1.1. When designing traffic patterns, be sure that:
        12.1.1.1. They conform to the requirements of paragraphs 12.2 and 12.3 below except
        when safety or noise problems require adjustments.
        12.1.1.2. No unusual or unnecessary maneuvering is required.
   12.1.2. When traffic patterns for two or more airfields are close together or overlap,
   coordinate letters of agreement regarding safe operations. The Airfield Operations Board
   reviews these LOAs.
   12.1.3. Coordinate revised traffic patterns with ATC agencies and the MAJCOM OPR for
   ATC.
12.2. VFR Traffic Pattern Types:
   12.2.1. Establish rectangular and overhead patterns at each USAF airfield, joint-use airfield
   and overseas airfield controlled by the USAF, as applicable to mission needs. Use LOAs to
   provide the desired traffic pattern at airfields under the control of foreign governments or
   agencies other than the USAF.
   12.2.2. Develop closed traffic procedures. Closed traffic is a maneuver that allows an
   aircraft making successive patterns to stay in the normal traffic flow without exiting and
   reentering the pattern.
   12.2.3. Bases may establish an additional rectangular pattern for light aircraft. This pattern
   provides adequate separation from normal rectangular and overhead pattern traffic.
   12.2.4. Establish separate helicopter patterns. These patterns are not necessary if the
   rectangular or light aircraft patterns meet operational needs without creating congestion.
12.3. VFR Traffic Pattern Altitudes. Establish traffic pattern altitudes by rounding up to the
next 100-foot level relative to airfield elevation. For example, the traffic pattern altitude for a
1,000-foot traffic pattern with a field elevation of 260 feet would be 1,300 feet above mean sea
level. Traffic pattern altitudes must provide a minimum of 300 feet obstruction clearance. Use
the traffic pattern airspace criteria as depicted in FAAO JO 7400.2, Procedures for Handling
Airspace Matters, to determine the area to be evaluated for obstacle clearance.
   12.3.1. Rectangular pattern: 1,000 feet above highest field elevation (1,500 feet if a lower
   altitude causes a noise problem).
   12.3.2. Overhead pattern: 1,500 feet above highest field elevation (2,000 feet if the 1,500
   foot rectangular pattern is used or if a lower altitude causes a noise problem).
   12.3.3. Light aircraft pattern: At least 500 feet above highest field elevation. In all cases,
   ensure adequate separation from normal rectangular pattern traffic.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                           123


   12.3.4. Helicopter patterns: Establish specific altitudes that ensure adequate separation from
   traffic in other patterns.
   12.3.5. Closed traffic: The altitude specified usually corresponds to the altitude of the
   pattern for which closed traffic is established.
12.4. Environmental Impact Analysis and Air Installation Compatible Use Zone
(AICUZ). Before making changes to local VFR flying areas, VFR traffic patterns or altitudes,
analyze proposals for impact based on the published AICUZ study and potential environmental
impact. Submit AF IMT 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, to the base civil
engineering environmental planning function for approval (see 32 CFR 989, Environmental
Impact Analysis Process). The Environmental Impact Analysis Process must be completed prior
to making any decision to implement the proposed change. Advise the base civil engineer when
the proposed change has been implemented.

                                 ATC TRAINING PROGRAM

13.1. Purpose. The purpose of training in the ATC career field is to qualify air traffic
controllers for position certifications, facility ratings, skill-level advancement and facility
management positions to support wartime readiness and peacetime operations. ATC training
programs consolidate and standardize common training tasks and doctrine while integrating Air
Force (AFI 36-2201 and AFMAN 36-2234), MAJCOM, and unit directives.
13.2. ATC Training Program Structure. ATC training program structure consists of four
parts and is designed to standardize the flow of all ATC training.
   13.2.1. Front Load Training (FLT).
       13.2.1.1. Part I - Local Area Knowledge.
       13.2.1.2. Part II - Facility Equipment.
   13.2.2. Facility Continuation Training (FCT).
       13.2.2.1. Part III - Position Certification.
       13.2.2.2. Part IV - Duty/Management Certification.
   13.2.3. After the supervisor completes an initial evaluation, CCTLRs must determine where
   controllers (all skill levels) will enter the training program, either in Part I, II, or III.
13.3. Training OI (TOI) Construction. AOF/CC must ensure a TOI is developed. The TOI
will establish policy and procedures for implementing and defining the responsibilities of all
personnel involved in the program. The TOI must expand those areas where further explanation
is required and standardize local training procedures. Each unit must develop, implement and
administer each program in accordance with this instruction, AFI 36-2201, and AFMAN 36-
2234. The TOI should not restate training requirements, procedures, or responsibilities already
published. Address all facets of ATC training in the TOI to include, but not limited to:
   13.3.1. Training Team Responsibilities.
   13.3.2. Newcomer‘s Indoctrination. CCTLRs must ensure a Newcomer‘s Indoctrination
   Program is developed in accordance with Attachment 7 and AFI 36-2201. CCTLRs may
   tailor indoctrination checklists to meet local mission requirements.
   13.3.3. Upgrade/Position certification/award of SEI and stop training circumstances.
       13.3.3.1. Requests for certification and processing channels.
       13.3.3.2. Local documentation requirements.
   13.3.4. Recurring, Review, and Supplemental Training (See Chapter 14).
   13.3.5. Radar/tower simulator usage and non-radar training requirements.
   13.3.6. Training program review procedures and documentation requirements.
13.4. Master Training Plan (MTP). MTP must be developed in accordance with AFI 36-2201
and contain the following:
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                           125


   13.4.1. CFETP/AFJQS/QTP. Document in accordance with AFI 36-2201.
   13.4.2. Master Task List (MTL)/Master Task and Technical Reference (MTTR). HQ
   AFFSA develops, maintains and publishes the USAF ATC MTTR. Each facility is required
   to maintain and publish a local MTTR. USAF/Local MTTR can serve as an MTL if the
   MTTR identifies which tasks coincide with each position.
   13.4.3. Certification Guides (Part I, II, III and IV)

 130                                             AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


       operate and maintain equipment. ATCSE Program Specialist must maintain a readily
       available copy of the most current manuals.
       13.8.2.2. Simulation Equipment. Administration level access to simulation systems will
       be limited to the authorized system administrator and designated assistants. Only
       authorized software may be loaded on ATCSE, as applicable. An outage log will be
       maintained (and retained for one year) to track and describe system/workstation
       malfunctions.
           13.8.2.2.1. Simulation and Integration of Ground, Network, and Air Links (SIGNAL)
           simulation program. Units may load additional software on the computers utilizing
           SIGNAL, with the approval of the Designated Approval Authority in coordination

13.9. Special Tactics Combat Control Team (CCT) Training. CCT personnel (AFSC
1C2X1) require ATC qualification training in USAF, ANG, or AFRC facilities. Each CCT
member must meet medical qualifications for ATC duty and possess an Airman Written Test
Report or CTO Certificate. Training of CCT personnel will follow the same local requirements
and guidelines as 1C1X1 personnel.
   13.9.1. CCT personnel may not work unmonitored until after they have obtained a CTO
   certification.
   13.9.2. CCT personnel may not be used to monitor or train 1C1X1 personnel.
13.10. Withdrawal from ATC Duty. AFMAN 36-2108, Enlisted Classification, and 14 CFR,
Part 65, require controllers to have an FAA Air Traffic Control Specialist (ATCS) certificate.
Failure to earn or to comply with the requirements to hold an FAA ATCS certificate will initiate
withdrawal action. Unit commanders initiate AFSC withdrawal and/or reclassification actions in
conjunction with ATCS certificate suspension. AFPC/DPSIT is the final approval authority of
AFSC withdrawal. The MAJCOM OPR for ATC is the final approval authority for
recommending ATCS certificate retention.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                          131


   13.10.1. ATC managers must identify controllers who demonstrate substandard performance
   to the squadron commander at the earliest time, in order to correct the substandard
   performance or obtain a suitable replacement.
   13.10.2. When withdrawal, disciplinary or other administrative actions are appropriate, do
   not allow one action to substitute for or delay the other. If more than one category of
   withdrawal is merited, the OSS commander will make the final determination of the most
   appropriate category of withdrawal in order to expedite resolution of pending actions.
   13.10.3. ATCS certificate withdrawal applies to military personnel holding a 1C1X1 or
   13M3 primary or secondary AFSC.
   13.10.4. Airfield Operations Officers holding the 13M1 AFSC, who fail to complete training
   for upgrade to 13M3 within established time limits IAW AFI 13-204 Volume I, are
   eliminated from training IAW AFI 36-2101.
   13.10.5. ATCS certificate withdrawal is not applicable to GS-2152 personnel.
   13.10.6. Contingency commanders who return a controller to home station for failure to
   comply with mission capability requirements will send an MFR to home station commander
   and MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM) documenting information IAW paragraphs
   A14.2.2, A14.4.1.2 & A14.4.1.3 A controller returned to home station for failure to obtain or
   maintain an ATC rating at a contingency location is not qualified to perform further ATC
   duties unless approved by MFM that has functional oversight. The MFM will review
   contingency commander actions and provide home station unit commanders a
   recommendation to reinstate or withdraw an individual‘s ATCS certificate.
13.11. Withdrawal Categories. There are three categories of withdrawal action applicable to
military controllers (AFSC 1C1X1 and 13M3): 1) medical disqualification, 2) failure to
maintain mandatory qualification standards other than medical, and 3) failure to obtain or
maintain a rating.         Sample memorandums and checklists associated with
suspending/withdrawing a military controller‘s FAA ATCS certificate and withdrawing ATC
AFSCs are provided at Attachment 12 - Attachment 17.
   13.11.1. Criteria for each withdrawal category are outlined below:
       13.11.1.1. Medical Disqualification.       The condition of Fear of Controlling (FOC), if
       substantiated, will be a medical category of withdrawal. FOC is a non-medical term for a
       specific phobia as listed in the most current, Air Force Surgeon General approved version
       of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). It is medically disqualifying, and a
       military psychiatrist or psychologist must diagnose this condition. If a controller
       professes a FOC (Attachment 13) the OSS Commander will accomplish the following:
          13.11.1.1.1. Suspend the individual's ATCS certificate (Attachment 12).
          13.11.1.1.2. Refer the individual to the flight surgeon.
          13.11.1.1.3. If after medical review, the individual is not diagnosed as suffering a
          specific phobia, as listed in the most current version of DSM, and the individual
          persists in the claim of FOC, consider the person as "self-eliminated" and withdraw
          from the career field under the category "failure to maintain mandatory qualification
          standards other than medical" (Attachment 17). Determine if the local flight surgeon
          considers the individual a hazard to flight safety.
 132                                               AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


          13.11.1.1.4. If the individual does not suffer from a specific phobia and abandons the
          claim of FOC, then return the controller to duty.
              13.11.1.1.4.1. A qualified controller must monitor the returned controller in every
              position in which the controller is certified until determining control practices are
              not a hazard to flying safety. The individual must successfully pass a special
              evaluation for each position certification held.
              13.11.1.1.4.2. The facility CCTLR will determine what requirements are needed
              prior to re-entering an unqualified controller into training.
       13.11.1.2. Failure to Maintain Mandatory Qualification Standards Other Than Medical
       (Attachment 17). Determination that a condition exists which could affect flying safety
       and ATCS certificate withdrawal is necessary.
       13.11.1.3. Failure to Obtain or Maintain a Rating (FTOR) (Attachment 14). Use these
       procedures for controllers in upgrade and qualification training. Do not recommend
       controllers for AFSC withdrawal until adequate training and evaluations substantiate
       FTOR. ATC managers may base withdrawal action on a controller's inability to
       complete the facility's simulator training program, if the simulator scenarios are not more
       difficult than actual routine traffic.
   13.11.2. For GS-2152 personnel, failure to obtain or maintain ratings for the position held or
   failure to maintain required medical standards, as specified in AFI 13-204v1, para 5.3.2., are
   grounds for termination of employment.
       13.11.2.1. Supervisors should carefully monitor GS-2152 controllers‗ progress in
       qualification training, in order to identify performance problems while they are in
       probationary status. DoD civilian employee controllers unable to obtain or maintain
       ratings during the probationary period do not require a PIP to be established. Supervisors
       should contact the CPF for guidance if considering terminating a DoD employee during
       the probationary hire period.
       13.11.2.2. When DoD civilian employee controllers fail to meet performance
       requirements after the probationary period, the supervisor should contact CPF for
       available options to terminate employment, based on failure to meet absolute standards as
       specified in the applicable GS-2152 SCPD. After the one year probationary period, a
       supervisor must develop a PIP to facilitate correction of the employee's performance
       deficiencies. If deficiencies are not corrected within specified time limits, the PIP (rather
       than the employee's AF Form 623 training records) will be used to support termination of
       employment. See Chapter 5 of AFI 36-1001, Managing the Civilian Performance
       Program, and contact the CPF for additional guidance.
   13.11.3. DELETED
   13.11.4. DELETED
13.12. Withdrawal and Reinstatement Procedures and Notification: (Attachment 16)

          17.1.6.6.2. Inspect pavement areas for loose aggregate or other foreign objects and
          contaminants. Ensure foreign objects and contaminants are removed promptly.
          17.1.6.6.3. The Asphalt Surfaced Airfields Pavement Condition Index Manual can be
          used to determine the severity of pavement conditions and priority for repair.
       17.1.6.7. Aircraft Arresting Systems.
          17.1.6.7.1. Inspect aircraft arresting systems for obvious conditions that could
          compromise the system‘s operation (e.g., noticeably loose cable, improper doughnut
          spacing, broken rope ties, pavement erosion beneath the cable (effective pendant
          height), etc.). If an unsafe condition exists, notify CE or Fire Department, Command
          Post and ATC facilities. Suspend runway operations until condition is corrected.
          (See Chapter 21 for additional information).
          17.1.6.7.2. Ensure system is sited and installed according to AFI 32-1043 or AC
          150/5220-9.
   17.1.7. Airfield Inspection Techniques. A varied inspection pattern is preferred to avoid
   complacency and the possibility of missing items that are in need of correction. When
   conducting an inspection on a runway and time only permits one pass on the runway,
   individuals should drive towards the direction of landing aircraft to see approaching aircraft
   and improve visibility of vehicle to pilots. However, it is highly recommended for runway
   inspection be done in both directions.
17.2. Airfield Check. An airfield check is not a substitute for the required daily airfield
inspection (except as noted in 17.1).
   17.2.1. All personnel performing an airfield check must be certified in their training record.
   Additionally, personnel must have completed the Airfield Inspection and Maintenance,
   Airfield Criteria and Wildlife Hazard Management CBTs and have an operational
   understanding of items in paragraphs (17.1.5.1 to 17.1.5.10).
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                          169


  17.2.2. Use the MAJCOM or locally developed Airfield Inspection Checklist and Diagram
  or electronic equivalents to accomplish airfield checks. Note: A separate checklist may be
  used to conduct and document the results of an airfield check. Regardless of the checklist
  used, maintain documentation in accordance with Air Force RDS, Table 33-46, Rule 31.00.
  17.2.3. Document and report all discrepancies and/or hazards identified during an airfield
  check to the appropriate agencies for correction.
  17.2.4. Conduct and document an airfield check to examine the primary takeoff, landing and
  taxi surfaces in support of:
     17.2.4.1. IFEs/GEs. Note: The AOI must clarify when local policy does not require a
     physical response by AM personnel to IFEs/GEs or if it is a "SOF‘s call". Document all
     "SOF calls" and IFE/GEs responses to the airfield on the AF IMT 3616.
     17.2.4.2. RSC and RCR determination.
     17.2.4.3. Wide body/heavy aircraft (e.g., B-52, B-747, C-17, C-5, KC-10, etc.) arrivals
     and departures as required by AOI.
     17.2.4.4. NVD Operations. Prior to the start of NVD operations, conduct an airfield
     check of the designated NVD runway, taxi routes and IR lighting configuration.
     Document and report discrepancies immediately. As a minimum, notify the Control
     Tower, CP, AFM, AOF/CC and SOF if NVD operations must be suspended due to
     airfield safety hazards.
     17.2.4.5. Other events, such as unauthorized aircraft landings, severe weather, airfield
     driving violations, checks of construction areas, natural disaster (e.g., tornado, typhoon,
     earthquake etc.) to check for conditions that could affect safe airfield operations.
  17.2.5. Conduct and document an airfield check before the start of wing flying activities
  each day and as required throughout the day to indentify, document and report
  FOD/BASH/Habitat control, ponding, etc. for correction. Note: Completion of the daily
  airfield inspection before the start of wing flying activities satisfies this requirement.
     17.2.5.1. Documentation of BASH/wildlife responses must include BWC, time of
     activity, weather conditions, location of activity, species, estimated number of
     birds/animals and dispersal method used.
  17.2.6. Conduct and document a daily lighting serviceability and marking retro-reflectivity
  check preferable between sunset and sunrise or during hours of reduced visibility.
     17.2.6.1. Check the operation of airfield lighting systems, to include the different
     intensity levels (Steps 1-5), as applicable.
     17.2.6.2. Check the operation of lighting systems that protect Instrument Critical Areas
     and Traffic Control Light Systems at the intersection of runways and taxiways.
     17.2.6.3. Check the retro-reflective characteristics (reflect light back to the source) of
     runway and taxiway markings.
     17.2.6.4. CE airfield lighting personnel may perform the lighting check when AM is
     unable to gain access due to system location such as on water. Ensure these procedures
     are included in a LOP or incorporated in the AOI.

17.3. Additional Airfield Inspections.
   17.3.1. A monthly joint airfield inspection comprised of representatives from airfield
   management (AFM/DAFM), AOF/CC, TERPS, SE (flight and ground), (SOF (host/tenant),
   CE (waivers/pavements) and SF is highly recommended.
       17.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) The AFM, Base Civil Engineer (BCE) Airfield Waiver
       Program Manager, Wing Flight Safety, and TERPS Liaison will conduct a quarterly joint
       inspection of the airfield.
   17.3.2. Conduct and document an inspection with representatives from CE and SE, before
   and after completion of any airfield construction, changes or additions to the flying mission
   or changes affecting existing aircraft parking/taxi procedures. Emphasis will be on "mission
   impact" of affected area(s) and necessary changes to the safety plan and the construction
   waiver.
   17.3.3. Conduct and document an annual Airfield Certification/Safety Inspection. See AFI
   13-204 Volume 2.

                                         Chapter 18

 DETERMINING AND REPORTING RUNWAY SURFACE CONDITION (RSC) AND
               RUNWAY CONDITION READING (RCR)

18.1. RSC and RCR procedures. Determine and report RSC and RCR, as required in this
chapter and T.O. 33-1-23, when the airfield is open.
18.1. (USAFE)Incirlik AB, Turkey, Lajes AB, Portugal, and Moron AB, Spain, are not
required to maintain Friction Measuring Equipment (decelerometer, Continuous Friction
Measuring Equipment, Mu-meter, etc).
   18.1.1. Use AFTO Form 277, Results of Runway Braking Test, when reporting RCRs.
   Maintain a file copy of the completed form in accordance with Air Force RDS, Table 10-10,
   Rule 5.00.
   18.1.2. Airfields with little or no record of snow accumulation (based on the installation‘s
   climatology record) are not required to maintain friction measuring equipment
   (Decelerometers, Continuous Friction Measuring Equipment, etc.) when approved by
   MAJCOM/A3 (normally in a MAJCOM supplement). Note: AM personnel must report the
   predominant RSC and indicate no RCR available.
   18.1.3. RSC determination and reporting procedures may differ at joint or shared use
   airfields.
NOTE: The AFM must ensure these procedures are outlined in the AOI.

   18.1.4. DELETED
   18.1.5. (Added-USAFE) At bases with limited airfield operating hours, obtain the RCR
   sufficiently in advance of aircraft operations. When the reported RCR is 12 or less,
   accomplish RCRs as frequently as traffic conditions allow during heavy traffic conditions
   and before each aircraft landing and takeoff under light traffic conditions. Determine
   taxiway and ramp values as required by OG/CC. Vehicles used to accomplish decelerometer
   readings should be equipped with four identical standard or snow tires. Tires should have at
   least 50 percent usable tread remaining and snow tires should not be equipped with studs.
   Inflate all tires to the tire manufacturer's or vehicle manufacturer‘s recommended pressure.
   The NCOIC, Airfield Management Training will ensure RCR training is documented on the
   AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, annually.
18.2. Determining RSC and RCR. Estimate and report RSC to the nearest 1/10 of an inch
according to T.O. 33-1-23. Note: Pilots determine braking action for slush and wet runways
from aircraft technical order data.
   18.2.1. Wet Runway (WR). When water is the only form of visible moisture on 25 percent
   or more of the runway surface area (whether in isolated areas or not), report the RSC as "wet
   runway" and no RCR. Note: Regardless of a Wet or Dry RSC, report the existence, location
   and depth of any standing water (ponding, water patches, puddles, etc.). Runways with
   historical drainage problems may require units to take more restrictive actions for reporting
   the RSC such as publishing restrictions or closures due to severe ponding, flooding and the
   potential for reduced braking action/hydroplaning.
172                                               AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


      18.2.1.1. Joint USAF/NASA tests have proven RCR measurements invalid where the
      only form of moisture affecting the runway is water.
      18.2.1.2. The AFM or designated representative determines and reports RSC.
      18.2.1.3. Specify in the AOI when other agencies are delegated the responsibility to
      determine and report the RSC. Regardless who determines the RSC Wet, the runway
      must be reported Wet as outlined in 18.2.1. In addition, a physical check of the runway is
      required to determine RSC Dry. Document all actions in the AF IMT 3616.
  18.2.2. Slush on Runway (SLR). When slush is on the runway and ice or snow is not
  present, report the RSC as "slush on runway‖. Do not report an RCR.
  18.2.3. Ice or Snow on Runway.
      18.2.3.1. For single type surface runway, determine the predominant RSC and the
      average RCR, when applicable, for the covered portions of the runway.
      18.2.3.2. When the runway surface consists of two pavement surfaces with significantly
      different friction characteristics, such as concrete and porous friction surfaces, determine
      the predominant RSC and RCR for the runway touchdown zones (surface one) and if
      applicable, for the middle or roll-out portion of the runway (surface two).
      18.2.3.3. The format used for transmission must clearly identify which runway portion
      has the high friction surface (HFS). For example, "PSR 12 HFS IR 08" identifies packed
      snow on runway, decelerometer reading 12 on touchdown portion, rollout portion is a
      high friction surface "HFS" with ice on runway, decelerometer reading 08. Provide two
      RSCs or RCR reports when the two types of runway surfaces have different runway
      cover.
      18.2.3.4. When using friction measuring equipment, round down if the reading is not a
      whole number (e.g., Reading 11.2, indicate 11; for 11.8, indicate 11).
  18.2.4. Water or Slush and Ice on Runway. When water or slush is present on an ice-
  covered runway, report the predominant RSC. Determine the RCR or use the value 12,
  whichever is lower.
  18.2.5. Runway Partially Covered with Ice or Snow. When the runway is partially
  covered with ice or snow, determine:
      18.2.5.1. One RSC for those parts of the runway that are completely covered.
      18.2.5.2. An RSC for the rest of the runway.
      18.2.5.3. An average RCR that is representative of those parts of the runway that are
      completely covered with snow or ice.
  18.2.6. Other Information. Identify and report other information essential to safe aircraft
  operations in clear text following the RSC and RCR data. Examples include but are not
  limited to the following:
      18.2.6.1. The extent or depth of any precipitation on the runway.
      18.2.6.2. Location of precipitation on partially covered runways (e.g., touchdown area,
      rollout area, etc.).
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                       173


      18.2.6.3. Use remarks such as sanded, patchy Wet or patchy Dry in conjunction with
      RSC conditions SLR, Loose Snow on Runway (LSR), PSR, or IR. If possible identify
      the location of the patchy conditions.
      18.2.6.4. DELETED
   18.2.7. Determine and report ramp and taxiway surface and friction readings as required in
   the Snow and Ice Control Plan.
   18.2.8. Anti-Lock Brake Systems (ABS). See T.O. 33-1-23 for vehicles equipped with
   ABS.
18.3. Reporting Runway Conditions.
   18.3.1. Disseminate RSC and RCR data to Control Tower, RAPCON or GCA facility,
   Weather and CP as a minimum.
   18.3.2. AFM determines if additional agencies should receive notification.
   18.3.3. When requested, AM will provide Control Tower and RAPCON or GCA facility
   with ICAO braking action remarks (GOOD, FAIR, POOR and NIL) as outlined in the Flight
   Information Handbook or Enroute Supplement for each value reported. Note: ICAO
   braking action reports are used by non-USAF aircraft.
   18.3.4. Send a NOTAM to report the surface condition (other than Dry) and/or friction
   reading for the following areas:
      18.3.4.1. Runway.
      18.3.4.2. Taxiway and Ramp areas as required in Snow and Ice Control Plan.
      18.3.4.3. Other information essential to safe operations. (See paragraph 18.2.6)
   18.3.5. When notified by the Snow Control Center that chemicals are being applied to
   airfield pavements (e.g., runway, taxiway, apron, etc.), as a minimum:
      18.3.5.1. Notify the Control Tower, RAPCON or GCA facility, MOCC, CP and TA.
      18.3.5.2. Send a NOTAM (e.g., Chemicals applied on runway). Work with the Snow
      Control Center to determine when the chemical agent has dissolved enough to cancel
      NOTAM.
   18.3.6. Send a Flight Advisory message and/or notify ARTCC as required to alert inbound
   aircraft of possible delays and/or poor braking action. (AFJMAN 11-213, FAAO JO 7110.10,
   Flight Services)
   18.3.7. (Added-USAFE) Conflicting braking action reports received from pilots will be
   documented on the AF IMT 3616, Daily Record of Facility Operation. Pass the conflicting
   information to appropriate ATC personnel and request their assistance in relaying the
   information to subsequent landing aircraft until AM can determine a new RCR/RSC.
18.4. Conducting RSC and RCR Checks.
   18.4.1. When the RSC is reported as WR or SLR and the possibility of freezing conditions
   exist, RCR checks are required.
174                                            AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012


  18.4.2. When the RCR is 12 or less, accomplish RCRs as frequently as normal flying
  operations allow and before each aircraft landing during low flying operations.
  18.4.3. During rapid changing conditions (e.g., increased snow fall, treatment of
  landing/taxiing surfaces, temperature changes, etc.) RSC and RCR checks must be
  conducted more frequently to ensure aircrews are provided with the most timely and accurate
  information.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                           175

      19.2.4.2. Purpose. AM PCGs are developed by HQ AFFSA/A3A and MAJCOM
      functionals to standardize training. AM PCGs are used to qualify personnel for duty
      positions and to assist personnel in meeting upgrade training requirements.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                        177


     19.2.4.3. Application. Develop PCG lessons for local training items documented on the
     AF IMT 797 or incorporate items into existing PCG lessons to meet local mission
     requirements and ensure 100% task coverage. Note: When developing local items into
     PCG lessons, use the same format as the standardized AM PCGs (e.g., AFM PCG,
     NAMO PCG, etc.). Document completion of locally developed PCGs on the AF IMT
     797. Initial completion of the PCG will be documented on the inside front cover of the
     AF Form 623 in Section II. Enter the short title and date (e.g., AFM PCG, NAMO PCG,
     etc) and the training completion date. The applicable STS items are listed on the actual
     lesson plans. PCG lessons may be rearranged and grouped together for block instruction.
     If this approach is used, provide a block overview that identifies the block objectives.
     19.2.4.4. Implementation. AM enlisted personnel will complete PCGs as a part of
     qualification training. PCGs will also be used as a part of upgrade training for enlisted
     personnel. Once an individual completes a PCG, they are not required to re-accomplish it
     due to PCS or relocation to another duty station. Each PCG has a time limit for
     completion (not to include TDY‘s, Deployments, Leaves, Hospitalizations, etc.). The
     AFM is delegated the authority to approve up to a 60-day extension for individuals
     experiencing difficulty in training (EDIT). The AOF/CC is the approval authority for
     extension that exceeds 60 days. AM military personnel that fail to complete a PCG
     within 1 year must be considered for withdrawal from the AFSC.
         19.2.4.4.1. AFM PCG. Start this PCG upon promotion to TSgt. Time limit to
         complete AFM PCG is 6 months.
         19.2.4.4.2. NAMO PCG. Start this PCG no later than 90 days after completing the
         NAMT PCG. Time limit to complete NAMO PCG is 6 months.
         19.2.4.4.3. NAMT PCG. Start this PCG as soon as the individual is entered into 7
         skill level upgrade training. Time limit to complete NAMT PCG is 6 months.
         19.2.4.4.4. AMOS/AMSL PCG. Start this PCG no later than 90 days after
         completing the AMOC PCG. Time limit to complete AMOS/AMSL PCG is six

             AIRFIELD RESTRICTIONS AND CLOSURE PROCEDURES.

21.1. Airfield Restrictions. At USAF bases, joint or shared use airfields, overseas bases and
associated airfields where AM is operated by the USAF, AM has the authority to impose the
following operational airfield restrictions. Note: These procedures must be clearly defined in
the AOI as appropriate.
   21.1.1. Close, suspend, and resume airfield, runway or taxiway operations.
   21.1.2. Temporarily suspend or close runway operations when any unsafe condition affects
   runway operations (e.g., FOD, severe bird/wildlife activity, snow and ice removal checks,
   arresting systems maintenance/configuration changes, airfield construction, pavement repair,
   etc.).
   21.1.3. Temporarily close an airfield to all traffic during hazardous weather such as
   tornadoes, hurricanes or typhoons.
   21.1.4. Limit operations to specific types of aircraft. Note: Airfield restrictions establishing
   limitations on the number or type of aircraft using an airfield will be coordinated with
   MAJCOM, host nation (as applicable), Wing/CC, OG/CC, AOF/CC and CP.
       21.1.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Limitations shall be published in the appropriate section of
       the In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan IGESP.
   21.1.5. Limit transient aircraft traffic to Official Business Only (OBO) and/or Prior
   Permission Required (PPR). Exception: Aircraft carrying a Distinguish Visitor Code 6 or
   higher or aircraft experiencing an emergency. Aircrew may use OBO/PPR facilities as an
   alternate for IFR flights when a landing at the intended destination becomes inadvisable.
   Aero medical Evacuation (AIREVAC) or Special Air Missions (SAM) are also exempt from
   OBO/PPR restrictions, but are required to obtain a PPR number for tracking and notification.
   21.1.6. Restrict use of an airfield due to classified operations when normal activity would
   compromise security.
   21.1.7. Restrict use of an airfield when facilities and services are reduced or lack sufficient
   resources (e.g., for limited transient services, limited apron parking space, major
   construction, reduced aircraft rescue and fire fighting capability, etc.).
   21.1.8. Prohibit low approaches, restricted low approaches and practice landings when
   airfield activities (e.g., construction, snow and ice removal operations, grass cutting
   activities, etc.) are in the vicinity of or on the runway. Note: Coordinate these types of
   restrictions with the OG/CC through the AOF/CC and notify Wing and tenant flying units.
   21.1.9. Restrict use of an airfield during NVD or blacked-out airfield operations to reduce
   the potential of normal activity compromising safety.
21.2. AM Procedures. AM must notify appropriate (e.g. ATC, CP, etc.) agencies and take the
following actions:
   21.2.1. Conduct a runway check and report the status prior to resuming normal operations.
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                       191


   21.2.2. Provide a time runway operations are expected to resume following the
   announcement of a suspension/closure. Note 1. A runway suspension is normally short in
   duration (e.g., in-flight/ground aircraft recovery operations, FOD removal, dispersal of
   severe bird/wildlife activity, aircraft arresting system reconfiguration, etc.). Note 2. A
   runway closure is normally for an extended period (e.g., snow and ice removal operations,
   construction/repair activities, aircraft mishap, etc.).
   21.2.3. Ensure tenant unit participation in preplanning meetings concerning airfield
   restrictions and closures.
   21.2.4. Inform MAJCOM at least 96 hours prior to the effective date for wider
   dissemination. Notify MAJCOM as soon as possible of unexpected (no-notice) restrictions.

Advanced Airfield Manager Course—This course provides training for selected USAF
AFI13-204V3_USAFESUP_I 11 MAY 2012                                                           209


personnel the knowledge and skills needed to perform the duties of the Airfield Manager.
This is an advanced AM course designed primarily for the USAF Senior NCO Airfield
Manager. Other potential candidates for this course include USAF Airfield Operations
Flight Officers, AF civilian Airfield Managers, Civil Engineering Community Planners,
Flying Safety Officers, as well as civilian contractors performing AM duties (to be
approved on case—by-case basis).
Advanced Airport Safety and Operations Specialist School—The advanced ASOS school is
designed for individuals who either have attended an earlier ASOS school or have at least two
years of supervisory experience in airport operations. The advanced school uses fewer prepared
presentations and more problem-solving workshops, role-playing scenarios and breakout groups
so that all attendees can actively participate in the proceedings. The case studies and general
discussions will cover a range of topics, including: environmental issues; winter operations
(deicing/snow removal); emergency planning; construction safety; vehicle operations; security
issues; hazmat/fuel spills; wildlife management/bird control. Course is provided by American
Association of Airport Executives (AAAE). Benefits: This hands-on interaction with industry
experts will enhance attendee‘s knowledge and problem solving skills involving critical airfield
functions.
Aerodrome—A defined area on land or water (including any buildings, installations and
equipment) intended to be used either wholly or in part for the arrival, departure, and movement
of aircraft.
Aircraft Mishap Investigation Course—This course provides aircraft mishap investigation
techniques and procedures. Course provided by HQ Air Force Safety Center, Kirtland AFB, NM.
Airfield Check—Conducted by Airfield Management personnel to the examine the primary
takeoff, landing and taxi surfaces in response to in-flight or ground emergencies, Runway
Surface Condition or Runway Condition Reading assessments, Foreign Object Damage removal,
and for Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazards and Habitat control.
Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI)—Formerly known as the flight line driving instruction.
Establishes local procedures for driving a vehicle on the airfield. Also called ADI.
Airfield Facilities—Includes runways, taxiways, aircraft parking and servicing areas, ATC
facilities, Airfield Management Operations, ATCALS, aircraft fire suppression and rescue
services, airfield lighting systems and systems to hold or stop aircraft (where required).
Airfield Inspection—Conducted by Airfield Management personnel to identify discrepancies
and/or hazards on the airfield (e.g., signs, markings, lighting, pavements, aircraft arresting
system, obstructions, obstacles, construction areas, etc.).
Airfield Management (AM)—A function that conducts airfield inspections and checks for

                  ATC NEWCOMER’S INDOCTRINATION PROGRAM

A7.1. PURPOSE: This attachment is designed to assist air traffic control managers in
developing an indoctrination program for newly assigned personnel. The goal is to orient
controllers with their new duty location. Newly assigned air traffic controllers, whether
apprentice or journeyman must be able to relate to the personnel and facilities they must work
with on a day-to-day basis. Managers can provide this information through a thorough and
comprehensive indoctrination program. A well-organized program must have a strong positive
effect on the new arrival. ATC Indoctrination Program must be completed within 30 days of
assignment. This indoctrination checklist must be maintained IAW AFI 36-2201, paragraph
6.7.1.13.
A7.2. OVERVIEW: An indoctrination program should fulfill the needs of the individual, as
well as the ATC mission. Needs must vary depending on unit of assignment. Facilities and
personnel visited, content and depth of briefings should vary depending on the new arrival‘s
experience and duty position. Make sure program is tailored to fit these needs.
A7.3. MANAGEMENT: The reporting official/rater and each member of the management
team (Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC), Chief Controller (CCTLR), NCOIC,
Air Traffic Control Training (NATCT), NCOIC, ATC Standardization and Evaluation (NSE),
and Watch Supervisors (WS)) must accomplish their portion of an indoctrination checklist when
briefing new personnel. It is very important that the new arrival be briefed on mission, training
requirements, duty schedules, etc. Each briefing should be presented by the individual most
directly responsible for a given area. The briefing given by the below individuals must cover,
but is not limited to, the following:
   A7.3.1. Reporting Official/Rater.
       A7.3.1.1. Conduct controller initial evaluation.

       A7.3.6.4. Review duty hours.
A7.4. TOURS AND VISITS. It is beneficial for new arrivals to visit other facilities and
agencies in the area and meet the people they must be working with. Newly assigned personnel
should receive a briefing on how these operations interface with the ATC mission and what they
do. Again, the amount of time spent at each facility, personnel contacted and depth of the
briefings may vary depending on the new controller‘s experience and duty position.
A7.5. OTHER ATC FACILITIES. Each individual must visit all air traffic control facilities
located at the installation. Be sure to include, if possible, nearby FAA or host nation air traffic
control facilities in the indoctrination.
A7.6. SUPPORT FACILITIES. Several non-ATC facilities support the air traffic control
mission. Day-to-day operations are affected through dealings with these agencies. As a
minimum, the indoctrination program should include these agencies, but is not limited to:
   A7.6.1. Weather Station. Provides information vital to ATC; and vice-versa. An insight into
   the overlapping responsibilities is beneficial when combined with some background of local
   meteorological phenomena. Request briefing on Weather/ATC Cooperative Weather Watch
   Program and Limited Weather Observation Criteria/Tower Visibility Training. Note: Initial
   Limited Weather Observation training will be documented on AF IMT 3622 and is signed off
   by a designated weather examiner.
   A7.6.2. Airfield Management Operations. Every airport layout has its peculiarities. Have
   airfield management personnel take the new individual on a tour of the airfield and point out
   areas where problems often arise.
   A7.6.3. Command Post/Center. This is the focal point for all installation activities. A visit
   here must put things into an installation wide perspective and show the new controller how
   ATC information plays an integral part in wing command and control.
   A7.6.4. Crash Control. Agency is the focal point for emergency responses.
   A7.6.5. Transient Alert. Tower controller‘s work directly with this agency and a visit here
   must be more beneficial for personnel assigned to tower.
   A7.6.6. Barrier Maintenance. Background information and actually seeing the barriers, must
   make barrier training more meaningful.
   A7.6.7. Runway Control Structures. All tower assigned controllers should visit this facility,
   if applicable, to develop insight into the level of involvement of the RCS officer and their
   working environment.
   A7.6.8. ATCALS Sites. All sites associated with ATC must be included in this tour.

A7.7. ATC MEETINGS. These are normally reserved for 7-levels and staff personnel. This
will help them develop an understanding of how airfield operations management fits into other
components of the unit and base. Include ATCALS Review Board meetings, Airfield Operations
Board (AOB) and the maintenance/job control briefing.
A7.8. LOCAL FLYING ORGANIZATIONS. This will enable the controller to see how they
function and how ATC interfaces with the flying community. If different organizations exist,
visit them all. Fighter, cargo, and training pilots all have different operational needs. This will
also enhance pilot/controller relations through a better understanding of the functions performed.
Don't forget to include the local Aero Club if applicable.

A8.1. PURPOSE. This attachment is designed to assist the NAMT in developing a
Newcomer‘s Indoctrination Program for newly assigned personnel. The goal of the Newcomer‘s
Indoctrination Program is to provide newly assigned personnel a work center orientation as
outlined in AFI 36-2201. The Newcomer‘s Indoctrination Program must be completed within 60
days of assignment (120 days for Air Reserve Component). Maintain a copy of the completed
Newcomer‘s Indoctrination Program in Tab F of the individual‘s training record and retain until
they PCS or PCA.
A8.2. OVERVIEW. The Newcomer‘s Indoctrination Program should fulfill the needs of the
individual, as well as the AM mission. Needs must vary depending on unit of assignment.
Facilities and personnel visited, content and depth of briefings should vary based on the newly
assigned individual‘s experience and duty position. Make sure program is tailored to fit these
needs.
A8.3. MANAGEMENT. The Airfield Operations Flight Commander, Airfield Manager,
NCOIC, Airfield Management Operations, NCOIC, Airfield Management Training and

   published four times per year and is the authoritative source for reporting identifiers and their
   applicability to airmen. Additionally, AFI 36-2201 provides further guidance. Criteria for
   RI are outlined below:
       A14.5.3.1. Disqualification reasons beyond control (Not for Cause) – RI 9A000. No
       longer meets the specialty qualifications for the awarded AFSC, and the basis for
       withdrawing the AFSC is for conditions or actions not within the member‘s control.
          A14.5.3.1.1. Medical conditions such as hearing loss, toxic chemical exposure,
          injuries, etc.
          A14.5.3.1.2. Failure to progress in training for reasons beyond the Airman‘s control
          (e.g., reading comprehension deficiency, learning disability, etc.).
       A14.5.3.2. Disqualification reasons within control (For Cause) – RI 9A100. Commander
       must consider separation for all airmen before initiating retraining.
          A14.5.3.2.1. Loss of security clearance due to misconduct.
          A14.5.3.2.2. Drug or alcohol involvement.
          A14.5.3.2.3. Failure to progress in training for reasons within their control. (e.g.,
          ability and aptitude to perform job, but doesn‘t try).
          A14.5.3.2.4. Substandard duty performance or other acts that lead to AFSC
          withdrawal.
       A14.5.3.3. RIs 9A200 (Enlisted Airman Awaiting Discharge, Separation, or Retirement)
       and 9A300 (Enlisted Airman Awaiting Discharge, Separation, or Retirement for Reasons
       Beyond Their Control) are described in the AFECD.

      A14.5.3.4. Each AFSC disqualification action stands on its own merits and, as such, the
      RI determination is based on the supporting documentation provided, to include ―For/Not
      for Cause.‖
  A14.5.4. CCTLR will print ―Void‖ across the face of the ATCS certificate.
  A14.5.5. OSS/CC will recommend retention or revocation of authority to wear the ATC
  badge or a statement that the authority to wear the badge was not given.
  A14.5.6. NATCT/TSN will notify the MAJCOM OPR for ATC once AFPC approves the
  AFSC withdrawal actions and MILPDS is updated removing the 1C1XX AFSC.
  A14.5.7. MAJCOM OPR for ATC will notify HQ AFFSA/A3A of completed ATC
  withdrawal action and include the following the information:
      A14.5.7.1. Name, Rank and Last four of SSN.
      A14.5.7.2. Skill Level (3, 5, 7 or 9 for enlisted controllers, 1 or 3 for officers).
