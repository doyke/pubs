            13 April 2001                                                               Pages: 73


This instruction reflects the change in operational construct and naming conventions at the
Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) Headquarters level from the legacy PACAF Air Mobility
Operations Control Center (AMOCC) to the Air Mobility Division (AMD) within the 613th Air
and Space Operations Center (AOC). The warfighting/contingency response functions resident
within the AOC have been added; while the peacetime functionality of the AMOCC is retained.
This instruction delineates the areas where communications and procedures are changed to
reflect this realignment.

This instruction also implements AFPD 10-21, Air Mobility Lead Command Roles and
Responsibilities, and prescribes specific guidance and information for aircrews, support
functions, and users of PACAF airlift and air refueling services. This instruction applies to all
PACAF-assigned active duty, Air National Guard (ANG), and Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC) units tasked with tanker and airlift operations under the command-and-control (C2) of
the 613 AOC/AMD. Air Force Instruction (AFI) 11-2 mission, design, series (MDS) specific
Volume 3, is the source document for weapon system specific information. This instruction
amplifies PACAF mobility operational procedures. In the event of a conflict between this
instruction and a governing MDS specific instruction, the MDS specific instruction takes
precedence. Airlift and tanker flying units will issue this instruction to all aircraft commanders
and place a copy of this instruction in their aircrew/mission trip kit.

                                 AIR MOBILITY DIVISION

1.1. Purpose. This instruction provides information, identifies functions, procedures, and tasks;
specifies organizational relationships; and contains guidance pertaining to the 613 AOC/AMD,
hereafter referred to as the 613 AOC/AMD or the AMD, and its operations. It applies to
operators and support personnel at all levels of the air mobility mission – from the AMD to the
aircrew member and all the supporting and operational units in between.
1.2. Mission. The AMD plans, coordinates, tasks, executes and controls the theater air mobility
mission across the spectrum of contingency (see Figure 1.1) – from normal, steady-state
operations (peacetime) through non-hostile contingencies to hostile contingency (wartime). The
AMD Chief leads the AMD and ensures the organization works as an effective division of the
AOC in the air and space planning and execution process. Throughout the spectrum, it is
imperative that unit members maintain combat mission readiness.

1.3. Organization. The AMD is comprised of four functionally oriented teams and two
specialty teams. The functional teams are the airlift control team (ALCT), the air refueling
control team (ARCT), the air mobility control team (AMCT), and the aeromedical evacuation
control team (AECT). The specialty teams are the air mobility support team (AMST) and the air
mobility exercise/training team. During periods of enhanced operations, members from the air
mobility operations groups (AMOG), AMC units, AFRC, ANG, ACC general-purpose
Numbered Air Forces (GPNAF), Air Force, and theater air component organizations may
augment the 613 AOC/AMD. Team compositions (e.g., numbers, specialties and skill levels) are
tailored to meet unique mission demands. See Figure 1.2 for the AMD Organizational
Schematic.
Figure 1.2. AMD Organizational Schematic. This schematic reflects how the 613 AOC/AMD
is structured. Highlighted are the contingency functions/sections required per the AOC construct.
The remaining, additional functions support AMD’s day-to-day operations. Together, this
construct allows the AMD to rapidly transition from peacetime to contingency operations.




                     * Can be filled with CV, DO, QAP or the ALCT, AMCT, AMCT, AMST Chiefs




   1.3.1. Airlift Control Team (ALCT). The ALCT provides intra-theater airlift functional
   expertise to plan and coordinate intra-theater airlift operations to support contingencies
   within the Pacific area of responsibility (AOR) and any joint operational area (JOA). The
8                                                                PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010


    ALCT is organized into six sections: airlift plans, requirements, air tasking order (ATO)
    integration, DIPCLR, EAS/OSA, and Pacific Military Airspace Reservation Function
    (PACMARF). The ALCT ensures the integration of inter-theater airlift missions with intra-
    theater air and space operations planning. When requested, the ALCT provides planning
    support to other AOC divisions, specifically strategy plans division (SRD) and combat plans
    division (CPD). The ALCT coordinates its activities with the ARCT, AMCT, and AECT to
    support the total air mobility effort.
    1.3.2. Air Refueling Control Team (ARCT). The ARCT plans and tasks air refueling
    missions to support theater air and space operations and coordinates air refueling planning,
    tasking, and scheduling to support an air bridge and/or global attack missions within the
    Pacific AOR and any JOAs that may be developed to support contingencies. The ARCT is
    organized into two sections: tanker plans and coronet operations. The ARCT is the validation
    authority for the 18WG tanker tasking for refueling operations. The ARCT ensures the
    integration of inter-theater air refueling missions with intra-theater air and space operations
    planning. When requested, the ARCT provides planning support to other AOC divisions,
    specifically SRD, CPD, and combat operations division (COD). The ARCT coordinates its
    activities with the ALCT, AMCT, and AECT to support the total air refueling effort.
    1.3.3. Air Mobility Control Team (AMCT). The AMCT provides centralized control of all
    intra-theater airlift operations within the Pacific AOR and any JOAs that may be developed
    to support contingencies. The AMCT is organized into five sections: mission management,
    flight management, logistics, airlift execution, and tanker execution. The AMCT directs or
    redirects, as required, air mobility forces in concert with air and space forces to respond to
    requirement changes, higher priorities, or immediate execution limitations. The AMCT
    maintains execution process and communications connectivity for tasking, coordinating, and
    flight following with the COD, subordinate air mobility units and mission forces. The AMCT
    ensures integration of efforts with 618th Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) to resolve
    problems and provide C2 information on air mobility operations. When needed, the AMCT
    provides airlift and tanker execution support to the COD. The AMCT coordinates its
    activities with the ARCT, ALCT, and AECT to support the total air mobility effort.
    1.3.4. Aeromedical Evacuation Control Team (AECT). The AECT provides operational
    planning, scheduling, and execution of scheduled and unscheduled aeromedical evacuation
    (AE) missions through the appropriate AE elements within the Pacific AOR and any JOAs
    that may be developed to support contingencies. It is organized into two primary functions:
    aeromedical plans and requirements (AE Plans) and aeromedical execution (AE Execution).
    The remaining function is conducted by the Theater Aeromedical Evacuation System
    (TAES) Manager, who plans and supports force flow within the AOR. The AECT
    coordinates its activities with the ARCT, AMCT and ALCT to support the total air mobility
    effort.
    1.3.5. Air Mobility Support Team (AMST). The AMST is an ad hoc team that can be
    tailored to provide various support functions to the AMD Chief and the functional teams
    within the AMD. The AMST is notional during most of the contingency spectrum. When
    needed, trained personnel are requested and brought in to augment the requisite support
    functions. There are nine support functions: intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
    (ISR), weather, airspace management, reports and briefs, information management,
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                      9


   communications, ground liaison officer (GLO), force protection (FP), and contingency
   response group (CRG) liaison. There is no standing AMST within the AMD.
   1.3.6. Air Mobility Exercise/Training Team (AME/TT). This team is a small cadre of
   trainers that maintain a high level of expertise in a particular functional position. During
   peacetime through non-hostile contingencies, they provide initial qualification training,
   mission qualification training, and continuation training to AMD personnel IAW AFI 13-
   1AOC, Volume 1, Ground Environment Training-Air and Space Operations Center, and
   provide planning for AMD participation in all levels of exercises. During hostile
   contingencies and exercises, they train augmentees and fill positions within their respective
   functional team of the AMD. The air mobility exercise/training team coordinates with the
   ALCT, ARCT, AMCT, and AECT to ensure combat mission readiness of AMD personnel
   and maximum benefits for any exercise participation.
1.4. Responsibilities. AFI 13-1AOC, Volume 3, Operational Procedures-Air and Space
Operations Center, covers the AOC weapon system that is provided by the Air Force forces
(AFFOR) and employed by the commander, Air Force forces (COMAFFOR) when designated as
a combined or joint force air component commander (C/JFACC), supporting component
commanders or when executing air and space operations and no C/JFACC is designated. The
613 AOC is responsible to provide operational-level C2 of air and space forces as the focal point
for planning, directing and assessing air and space operations. The AMD is the executive agent
within the 613 AOC that is responsible for the execution of the air mobility mission. It tasks
airlift and tanker assets to execute this mission over the entire spectrum of contingency – from
peace to war. During peacetime, operational units and required support agencies are tasked via
the Global Decision Support System (GDSS). During hostile contingencies, taskings are
accomplished through Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS) via an ATO. This
ensures the air mobility missions are de-conflicted with the combat side of the hostile
contingency. See Figure1.3. for the ATO Cycle.

Figure 1.3. Air Tasking Order Cycle.




1.5. Tasking Methods. The AMCT manages the execution of the air mobility mission during
steady state/day-to-day operations, and tasks/exercises C2 through the mobility air forces (MAF)
GDSS system. The ATO will include air mobility missions, as directed, when the AMD executes
contingency or humanitarian assistance/disaster relief (HA/DR) operations.

                                           Chapter 2

                                PACAF MOBILITY FORCES

2.1. Air Mobility Management. Safety is paramount and is everyone’s responsibility. It is
incumbent upon everyone involved with any aspect of a mission to identify the risks associated
with that mission, and take the necessary steps to reduce those risks to the maximum extent
possible. Although an acceptable level of risk is intrinsic to mission performance, unnecessary
risks that endanger resources and personnel are unacceptable.
   2.1.1. Teamwork is the lynchpin of integrated air mobility operations and provides
   continuous support to users and warfighters. All elements must work in concert to enable
   each mission to depart on time, adhere to the schedule, and provide the best possible service
   to our customers.
   2.1.2. Aircraft commanders are responsible for mission accomplishment and the safety and
   security of mobility resources under their charge. The AMD, as the tasking authority, is
   responsible for the optimum utilization of these air mobility resources.
   2.1.3. Mission planning is a collaborative effort between AMD and the respective wings.
   AMD, however, maintains overall responsibility for planning the missions it tasks. Mission
   planning duties include: ensuring airfield suitability using the airfield suitability and
   restrictions report (ASRR); reviewing notices to airmen (NOTAMS) and instrument flight
   rules (IFR) supplements; checking the PACAF Force Protection Requirements Matrix; and
   PACAF Threat Working Group (TWG) recommendations (when the mission is transiting an
   airfield that may pose increased risk to the aircraft or aircrew). AMD Planners will advise
   aircrews of any hazards and operating restrictions; provide an operational risk assessment in
   collaboration with the flying unit; request and obtain prior permission required (PPR) and
   DIPCLRs; request terminal instrument procedure (TERP), when necessary; secure required
   waivers (e.g., weight bearing capacity, etc.); ensure appropriate material handling equipment
   (MHE) is available for loading and unloading activities at scheduled stops; verify airfield
   operating hours; prepare flight plans; and load mission information into GDSS and the Joint
   Air Logistics Information System-Next Generation (JALIS-NG). The respective wing is
   responsible for actions not directly related to planning such as: submitting country clearances
   for personnel; acquiring visas or passports for aircrews or other personnel; securing billeting;
   ensuring messing availability or operating hours.
   2.1.4. Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR). ASRR information is available
   via the worldwide web to planners, aircrews and non-multi-level security (MLS) or GDSS
   equipped customers. For planners and aircrews without access to the worldwide web, contact
   the AMD Mission Manager (DSN 315-448-8888) for assistance in obtaining ASRR
   information.
   2.1.5. Operational Risk Management (ORM). PACAF and PACAF-gained MAF units will
   comply with AMC-approved (lead MAJCOM) ORM processes.
2.2. C-130 Operations.
   2.2.1. Standard and minimum en route ground times and exceptions will be IAW AFI 11-
   2C-130, Volume 3, C-130 Operations Procedures. Ground times may be shortened to 1+30
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                         13


   hours if the aircraft is only scheduled to refuel. With the concurrence of the PACAF/A3,
   standard en route ground times may be reduced by the AMD Senior Director or as authorized
   via PACAF operational orders (OPORD) for exercises and contingencies when mission
   requirements dictate. Missions that do not require onload/offload or refueling may be
   reduced to 30-minutes without seeking PACAF/A3 waiver. The AMD Mission Manager may
   authorize increased en route ground times during mission execution, or the AMD Airlift
   Planners can increase ground times during mission planning.
   2.2.2. Normally, a minimum 16-hour ground time between engine shutdown and mission
   takeoff should be planned unless extended post flight duties are anticipated. The aircraft
   commander can request the AMD Mission Manager/Senior Director modify normal ground
   times due to:
       2.2.2.1. Safety related issues.
       2.2.2.2. No less than 12-hours from the start of crew rest until mission reporting. Before
       reducing normal ground time, consider mission preparation time, time to load cargo and
       other factors peculiar to the mission. The controlling C2 agency will not ask the aircraft
       commander to accept less than a normal ground time. Waivers for exercises and
       contingencies are according to AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules.
       2.2.2.3. If practical, make the en route ground time 36-hours (maximum) after three
       consecutive near maximum FDPs. Note: Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR
       is not an alternative to a safety-of-flight delay but provides pilot-in-command (PIC) a
       means to minimize the adverse effects of a crew alert and report period outside normal
       duty time. CECR periods should be of minimum duration and are normally used during
       de-positioning legs. C2 agent shall approve PIC requests to delay alert time to normalize
       the work-rest cycle or increase messing options when mission allows. When requests are
       disapproved, the C2 agent will inform the PIC of the reason for disapproval.
2.3. C-130 Policy and Allocation Process. Scheduling is an iterative process between AMD
and the tasked airlift unit, with a goal of maximizing quality training opportunities and TWCF
missions. For operations, the allocation will be 65 percent of the possessed subtotal per the C-
130 Aircraft and Aircrew Tasking System (A/ATS), and 35 percent for maintenance. See
Attachment 2 for the C-130 allocation process.
   2.3.1. C-130 Collaboration and Tasking Process.
       2.3.1.1. C-130 airlift will not be assigned to any request without first being validated by
       the unit SAAM validator or by the U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) validator. Upon
       the validation of a time phased force deployment data (TPFDD) or SAAM request, users
       can collaborate mission specifics directly with AMD Requirements. AMD Requirements
       will then verify C-130 aircraft availability via A/ATS against the user’s requirements
       [i.e., priority, earliest arrival date (EAD) or latest arrival date (LAD)].
           2.3.1.1.1. If aircraft are available, AMD Requirements will forward the request to the
           AMD Airlift Planners for planning and execution. Once planned, the AMD Airlift
           Planners will release the GDSS Mission Detail tasking the appropriate wing.
           2.3.1.1.2. If aircraft are not available, AMD Requirements will work with the
           requester for an alternate date. If aircraft are not available or an alternate date cannot
 14                                                             PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010


          be established, AMD Requirements will notify the requester that the tasking will be
          ―non-supported.‖
       2.3.1.2. The 374 AW Current Operations will submit an A/ATS spreadsheet as required
       by the PACAF A/ATS Spreadsheet referenced in Table A2.1
   2.3.2. 96-Hour Rule. Requests for C-130 airlift assets must be received by AMD
   Requirements 96-hours prior to the requested mission execution time. If a request does not
   meet this criterion, AMD Requirements may ―non-support‖ the requirement or require the
   requestor to adjust their timing. Requests inside of 96-hours will be supported on a case-by-
   case basis. The requester, however, must first obtain written approval from the 13 AF/CV or
   13 AF/CC prior to the requirement being validated and tasked to the wing. AMD will attempt
   to task flying wings at least 96-hours prior to departure, but at a minimum, the tasking will
   meet the home-station pre-departure crew rest requirements IAW the applicable AFI 11-
   2(MDS), Volume 3 series.
2.4. C-17 Operations.
   2.4.1. Standard and minimum en route ground times and exceptions will be IAW AFI 11-
   2C-17, Volume 3, C-17 Operations Procedures. Missions that do not require onload/offload
   or refueling may be reduced to 30-minutes without seeking PACAF/A3 waiver.
   2.4.2. The aircraft commander can request the AMD Mission Manager/Senior Director
   modify normal ground times due to:
       2.4.2.1. Safety related issues.
       2.4.2.2. No less than 12-hours from the start of crew rest until mission reporting. Before
       reducing normal ground time consider mission preparation time, time to load cargo, and
       other factors peculiar to the mission. When possible, contact home station DO and
       aircraft commander for ORM assessment. The controlling C2 agency will not ask the
       aircraft commander to accept less than a normal ground time. Waivers for exercises and
       contingencies are according to AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
       2.4.2.3. If practical, make the en route ground time 36-hours (maximum) after three
       consecutive near maximum FDPs. Note: Crew Enhancement Crew Rest (CECR). CECR
       is not an alternative to a safety-of-flight delay but provides PICs a means to minimize the
       adverse effects of a crew alert and report period outside normal duty time. CECR periods
       should be of minimum duration and are normally used during de-positioning legs. C2
       agent shall approve PIC requests to delay alert time to normalize the work-rest cycle or
       increase messing options when mission allows. When requests are disapproved, the C2
       agent will inform the PIC of the reason for disapproval.
   2.4.3. C-17 missions are planned for maximum allowable cabin load (ACL). Cargo will not
   be offloaded to facilitate a nonstop flight without approval from the controlling C2 agency.
   2.4.4. All C-17 missions will depart with a minimum of 54-sidewall seats installed/stowed
   and 3-litter stanchion assemblies stowed. For airdrop missions, configuration will be IAW
   AFI 11-2C-17, Volume 3, Addenda A, C-17 Configuration and Mission Planning.
2.5. C-17 Policy and Allocation Process. Per the USTRANSCOM/USPACOM C-17
Memorandum of Agreement, the C-17 allocation within PACAF is six (6) aircraft each at 3 WG
and 15 AW for operations from a primary aircraft authorization (PAA) of eight (8) aircraft. Of
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                          15


these, four (4) aircraft will be available to AMD for tasking, and two (2) aircraft are set aside as
fenced-trainers for 3 WG and 15 AW training. In this instruction, the organizations responsible
for the allocation of airlift requirements are TACC/XOBA and AMD Requirements. For
additional information, see Attachment 3.
   2.5.1. TACC/XOBA collaborates with AMD Requirements to allocate C-17 missions based
   on the AOR and IAW the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) prioritization system.
   2.5.2. PACAF C-17s execute both inter- and intra-theater airlift missions:
       2.5.2.1. Inter-theater missions will be tasked, planned and controlled by TACC.
       TACC/XOBA is responsible for communicating this information to the appropriate
       TACC Directorate(s). TACC will contact AMD when a PACAF aircraft/aircrew is
       involved in a serious incident during a TACC controlled mission. If there is a significant
       change to a TACC controlled mission, AMD will be informed.
       2.5.2.2. Intra-theater missions will be tasked, planned and controlled by AMD. The
       GDSS Mission Detail’s, ―Mission Alias‖ will specify ―613 AOC/AMD C2‖ for AMD-
       controlled missions.
2.6. KC-135 Operations. Standard and minimum en route ground times and exceptions will be
IAW AFI 11-2KC-135, Volume 3, C/KC-135 Operations Procedures.
2.7. KC-135 Allocations. Allocation for 18 WG KC-135 aircraft is 60 percent for operations
and 40 percent for maintenance based on PAA. This equates to nine (9) aircraft available for
operations from a PAA of fifteen (15) aircraft. Of these, seven (7) aircraft will be available to
AMD for tasking, and two (2) aircraft are set aside as fenced-trainers for 18 WG training.
PACAF supplement to AFI 11-221, Air Refueling Management (KC-10 and KC-135) contains a
more detailed explanation.
   2.7.1. The AMD, through the AMD Tanker Operations, is the tasking authority for all
   PACAF-assigned and PACAF-gained tanker assets. For coronet operations, AMC and TACC
   are authorized to include PACAF-assigned active duty tankers in a TACC tanker task
   message provided prior coordination and approval with the AMD Tanker Barrel has been
   accomplished (most commonly through the quarterly ―horseblanket‖ process). Missions
   assigned through the horseblanket process are considered tasked as listed. Any requests for
   changes must be coordinated with the AMD Tanker Barrel. AMD Tanker Operations provide
   full mission planning for those missions it tasks, except coronet missions (see paragraph
   2.7.3).
   2.7.2. PACAF tanker units are responsible for mission planning local and off-station training
   missions, JCS-priority 3 and below missions, and any non-AMD tasked missions. However,
   given sufficient notice of the itinerary (at least 48-hours prior to initial departure) by the wing
   current operations office or from the crew itself, the AMD Tanker Planners may assist with
   planning these missions.
   2.7.3. Coronet Operations. Mission planning for coronet operations will be accomplished by
   the assigned tanker detail planner (TDP). The AMD Tanker Detail Planners will provide
   and/or coordinate mission-planning support for all AMC/ANG/AFRES/PACAF tankers
   performing air refueling missions in support of coronets. Once a coronet mission has
   commenced, any changes will be coordinated through the delivery control officer (DCO;
 16                                                               PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010


   fighter representative), the TACC/XOCGT and the TDP (tanker representative) responsible
   for the coronet in question. Tankers on coronets are tasked and C2 by TACC.
2.8. Airlift/Air Refueling Priority System. The airlift and air refueling priority system can be
found in Joint Publication (JP) 4-01, Joint Doctrine for the Defense Transportation System, and
AFI 11-221. To maximize the benefit of limited airlift capability, the JCS has adopted a priority
system for use in the management of Department of Defense (DOD) common user airlift
resources. Competent authority must establish an urgency of need or the existence of valid
circumstances to use a priority other than that of a normal channel airlift. When requirements for
airlift exceed capability, airlift managers are directed to apply capability to the highest priority
category first at the expense or denial of lower airlift categories.
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                      17


                                           Chapter 3

                          PACAF AIR MOBILITY OPERATIONS

3.1. Purpose. This chapter defines responsibilities and procedures for executing air mobility
operations within the USPACOM AOR. It applies to the AMD, PACAF Command Posts, and
PACAF-assigned or –gained aircrews.
3.2. Responsibilities. PACAF Command Posts and aircrew responsibilities are delineated
below.
   3.2.1. PACAF Command Post Responsibilities. PACAF Command Posts serve as the
   primary POC for PACAF-assigned or -gained C-12, C-37, C-40, C-130 and KC-135 air
   mobility aircraft that transit their base during execution of an operations and maintenance
   (O&M) mission. When PACAF-assigned or –gained C-17s, C-130s or KC-135s execute an
   USTRANSCOM Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) mission (a.k.a. AMC
   mission), aircrews will be supported via the AMCC (if assigned). If there is no AMCC or
   designated AMC representative assigned, then the PACAF Command Post is responsible for
   coordinating aircraft support outlined in this instruction. The PACAF Command Post’s will:
       3.2.1.1. Use GDSS to track missions transiting their base and to determine necessary
       support requirements. Effective coordination between the crew and CP is essential to
       ensure appropriate support (to include crew alerts) for mission execution. Once notified
       of an aircraft's inbound status, controllers must relay that information to base support
       agencies and ensure support is available upon the aircraft's arrival. Within 15-minutes of
       an aircraft’s arrival and/or departure, controllers will enter all flight arrival/departure
       times, delay codes and appropriate remarks into GDSS. For OSA mission departures,
       command post controllers will enter a zero (0) for passengers (PAX) under the
       ―DEPARTURE‖ section in GDSS when the aircraft commander reports that no PAX are
       being carried.
       3.2.1.2. Ensure mission information is entered in GDSS (to include aircraft tail number
       and call sign) twenty-four (24) hours prior to scheduled departure. If circumstances
       prevent information from being entered in GDSS, contact the AMD Mission Manager
       (DSN: 315-448-8888) and provide information for data entry.
       3.2.1.3. Coordinate with aircrew and support agencies to determine delay codes and
       applicable remarks for missions departing 15-minutes past the scheduled departure time.
       PACAF Command Posts will use delay codes specified in AMCI 10-202, Volume 6,
       Mission Reliability Reporting System. Advisories must be updated in GDSS as soon as it
       becomes known that a mission may deviate from its itinerary. Information can be voiced
       to the AMD Mission Manager when unable to update GDSS or for help in determining
       delay codes.
       3.2.1.4. Coordinate maintenance or transient alert support.
       3.2.1.5. Coordinate Prime Knight service as described in paragraph 3.15
       3.2.1.6. Coordinate cargo and passenger preparations (i.e., load briefing setup with air
       terminal operations center (ATOC), contracted air terminal operations (CATO) or aerial
       port as necessary). Since AMC owns the ATOC, aerial ports and CATO, address
 18                                                             PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010


       coordination and mission support requirements with the tenant AMS in an In-garrison
       Expeditionary Support Plan.
       3.2.1.7. Coordinate customs and agriculture (as required).
       3.2.1.8. Coordinate fleet service.
       3.2.1.9. Notify the next remain over night location of inbound aircrews and ensure copies
       of the TDY orders are obtained either by GDSS or FAX.
   3.2.2. Aircrew Responsibilities at Non-PACAF Bases. When landing at bases without a
   PACAF Command Post, the aircraft commander, or designated representative, must contact
   the AMD Mission Manager with pertinent mission information (i.e., landing time,
   maintenance status and other pertinent data). Once the aircrews establish billeting
   arrangements, the aircraft commander will call the AMD Mission Manager and provide
   necessary contact numbers. At this time, alert time and procedures, weather, flight plans, and
   any other mission support requirements for subsequent mission legs will be coordinated
   between the AMD and aircraft commander.
   3.2.3. Aircrew Responsibilities at PACAF Bases. Aircrews must be proactive in contacting
   the PACAF Command Post. When inbound to a base with a PACAF Command Post,
   aircrews are required to make inbound calls as required in Chapter 2 of the specified AFI 11-
   2(MDS), Volume 3 series instructions. Upon arrival, relay landing and block times and any
   pertinent updates to include crew alerts to C2 agent or AMD Mission Manager. For AE
   missions, inbound calls are paramount. Crews executing AE missions will contact the
   command post 2+00 hours prior to arrival so the command post can notify supporting
   medical agencies, which allows these agencies adequate time to respond.
3.3. Initial Mission Setup. The AMD enters all mission data into GDSS for AMD-tasked and
-controlled missions, whereas, the wing current operations enter GDSS mission data for O&M
missions. Twenty-four (24) hours prior to initial departure, mission control transfers from the
AMD Airlift or Tanker Planners to the AMD Flight and Mission Managers for execution. Prior
to this transfer, the respective planning cell will ensure mission planning is complete and all
issues resolved to include appropriate DIPCLRs for DIP-cleared routes, PPRs, itinerary times,
ground times, weight-bearing issues, payload, airfield operations hours, airfield suitability,
NOTAMs, waivers, RAVEN support, etc. Wing current operations will enter aircraft and crew
information to include local and off-station training missions not-later-than (NLT) 24-hours prior
to departure for all originating missions. Along with mission details and scheduled times, enter:
aircraft commander's name; last four of SSN; squadron; wing; scheduled return time (SRT);
build a ―formed crew‖ and designate crew type (B – basic, A – Augmented). C-12/C-130 units
will enter Iridium phone numbers in the leg remarks section on the Mission Detail. ―Aircraft
Commander’s Iridium phone # is: _____‖ will be annotated for each mission IAW the PACAF
Iridium concept of operations (CONOPS).
   3.3.1. Operational Risk Management (ORM) Assessment. AMD will comply with AMC-
   approved ORM processes.
3.4. Mission Changes (AMD Generated Recuts). Coordinate all mission recuts with the AMD
Mission Manager for AMD-tasked and -controlled missions. After the mission transfers from the
planning cell to the execution cell, revisions to the mission should be limited and only
accomplished after extensive coordination with affected agencies (i.e., down range calls to
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                         19


command posts, aerial port control center (APCC), ATOCs, CATOs, users, maintenance,
transient alerts, etc.). Close coordination between the planning and execution cells is essential for
any mission changes.
3.5. Mission Changes (Unit Generated Recuts). Wing current operations are responsible for
mission recuts when a local (home station to home station) training mission is recut to another
local (home station to home station) mission. No coordination with AMD is required, but all
itinerary changes must be reflected in GDSS. All sorties during off-station training missions
must be entered in the GDSS Mission Detail. For off-station missions, aircraft commanders are
responsible for relaying all departure and arrival times for each training sortie and mission flown
to their home unit/command post. If the home unit or command post is unable to input these
times, the AMD can assist. All mission changes for off-station training missions supported by
AMD will be coordinated through AMD before they take effect.
3.6. Mission Closeout. PACAF Command Post will close out all AMD-tasked missions and
wing training missions after coordination with their wing current operations. When a PACAF
Command Post is unable to enter a delay code, they must coordinate with base agencies, the
aircrew, and AMD, as necessary, to determine the proper delay code and its reason. If a mission
terminates at locations without a PACAF Command Post, the crew must contact the AMD
Mission Manager and pass pertinent mission information (i.e., arrival/take-off times, advisories,
delay codes explanations) who in turn will close out the mission.
3.7. Mission Pre-Launch Support. Mission pre-launch support is provided to crewmembers
on missions that originate from or transit a PACAF base. Types of required support include:
   3.7.1. Integrated Flight Management (IFM). When applicable, the AMD Flight Manager
   provides IFM services for PACAF-assigned or -gained air mobility assets. These services
   include:
       3.7.1.1. A comprehensive IFM mission package that contains: computer flight plans
       (International Civil Aviation Organization Flight Plans); NOTAMs; weather
       forecasts/charts from the 17th Operational Weather Squadron and assigned combat
       weather team; GDSS Mission Detail; PPR; DIPCLR; aircrew critique; and if required,
       TERP information; ASSR and Giant Reports; and electronic filing of flight plans.
       3.7.1.2. Aircrews will obtain IFM mission packages via the GDSS website. The GDSS
       website gives controllers, aircrews and base operations personnel the ability to retrieve
       mission packages. Crewmembers will have GDSS accounts, maintain currency, and
       receive the necessary training to enable access to GDSS products. GDSS accounts are the
       primary means to access mission packages. Contact the GDSS Helpdesk at Scott AFB,
       (DSN 312-576-4949) for help in resolving system problems or password/account issues.
       3.7.1.3. The AMD Flight Manager can provide computer flight plans for depot
       inputs/outputs, and off-station training missions when requested. For all flight plan
       requests, aircrews must give the AMD Flight Manager at least 24-hours notice. Requests
       within 24-hours of departure are accomplished on a workload-permitting basis. Non-
       AMD tasked air refueling flight plan requests will be coordinated at least 72-hours prior
       to departure to the appropriate AMD Airlift (DSN: 315-448-8855) or AMD Tanker
       Planners (DSN: 315-448-8857). Flight plan requests that involve air refueling must
       include the additional information listed in paragraph 13.4.1
 20                                                            PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010


3.8. Command Post and Aircrew Critiques. Constructive critiques help build an effective C2
system. As such, aircrews and command posts will submit critiques to address C2 issues or
concerns. The AMD website (see paragraph 1.6) provides links to several critique forms that can
be used to submit C2 complaints or complements. They are: AMD Aircrew Survey, Aircrew
Critique of Command Post and Command Post Critique of Aircrew. To maintain chain of
command integrity, the originating individual should provide a copy of the critique to their
supervisor or commander. This feedback provides a means for process improvement so the AMD
can better serve its customers.
3.9. Alerting Procedures and Aircrew Management. Ground times vary depending on the
aircraft type, but no less than the minimum required ground time for crews that remain overnight
(RON) IAW the applicable AFI 11-2(MDS), Volume 3 series. Ground time changes that affect
original mission timing and any other mission changes must be coordinated with the AMD
Mission Manager via the command post. Aircraft commanders must notify the PACAF
Command Post or AMCC, who in-turn will notify the AMD Mission Manager when post-flight
duties are ongoing and completed. If no PACAF Command Post or AMCC exists, aircrews must
contact the AMD Mission Manager directly via any means available (i.e., DSN/Comm, Iridium,
cell phone, HF phone patch) for follow-on mission setup. See paragraph 1.6
   3.9.1. The command post coordinates alert times with the aircraft commander upon landing
   and prior to entering crew rest. If an alert time requires a change to the scheduled takeoff
   time, contact the AMD Mission Manager. When no command post or C2 agency is available,
   crews shall coordinate alerting times and procedures with the AMD Mission Manager. Local
   unit policies will direct when and how aircrews are alerted for all sorties originating from
   home station. For Kadena home station AE departures, the AMD Mission Manager will
   notify the 18 WG Command Post to alert the aircraft commander, who will in turn alert the
   Medical Crew Director (MCD).
       3.9.1.1. C-130 aircrew alert time is normally 3+15 hours before scheduled takeoff time
       IAW AFI 11-2C-130, Volume 3 for non-tactical missions. This can be modified
       (shortened) with concurrence of the aircraft commander. At no time will command post
       personnel specifically ask an aircraft commander to accept an alert time of less than 3+15
       hours prior to scheduled takeoff. Any modification to the original mission timing will be
       coordinated with the AMD via the command post.
       3.9.1.2. Aircrew alert times for C-130 tactical missions are outlined in local unit
       publications and may vary. On tactical missions, the aircraft commander is responsible
       for coordinating their alert time with the command post or the AMD (when no command
       post is available).
       3.9.1.3. C-17 aircrew alert time is normally 3+45 hours (4+15 for airdrop missions)
       before scheduled takeoff time IAW AFI 11-2C-17, Volume 3. Operations group
       commanders (OG/CC) may establish alert procedures for local training missions.
   3.9.2. KC-135s on Coronet Missions. Ground times vary and are based on the Air Combat
   Command (ACC) Fighter Delivery ATO. Under no circumstances will ground times be less
   than that prescribed by AFI 11-2KC135, Volume 3. Alerting procedures will also vary
   depending on the local C2 infrastructure. Since TACC has C2 of coronet missions and the
   intermixing of PACAF and AMC tankers during a coronet fighter move, the TDP will
   coordinate with the AMCC for base support and C2 issues. The TDP is responsible for
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                           21


   coordinating these requirements with the resident C2 agency or PACAF Command Post if
   there is no AMCC at that station.
      3.9.2.1. KC-135 crews engaged in off-station missions that are not coronet/air refueling
      missions, will be alerted IAW AFI 11-2KC-135, Volume 3. For dual-role missions (cargo
      and air refueling), refer to AFI 11-2KC-135, Volume 3 for guidance concerning ―cargo-
      only without rollers‖ missions. Detailed coordination by the aircraft commander with the
      command post is required.
   3.9.3. Except for emergencies, crews will not be alerted before their established alert time. If
   an emergency exists and time permits, contact the AMD Mission Manager for approval prior
   to alerting a crew before the pre-established alert time. An aircrew will not be alerted if their
   aircraft is not mission capable (NMC) unless there is reasonable assurance the estimated time
   in commission (ETIC) will permit the mission to depart as scheduled. Contact the AMD
   Mission Manager to resolve questions or confusion about crews being alerted against an
   NMC aircraft.
   3.9.4. Any decision to delay alerting a crew will be coordinated with the AMD Mission
   Manager. The crew rest period may be extended (postpone alerting the crew) IAW the
   applicable AFI 11-2(MDS), Volume 3 series instructions past the legal for alert time (known
   as ―burning in the window‖) for delayed missions (due to mission changes, maintenance,
   weather, etc.).
      3.9.4.1. The aircraft commander may extend crew rest IAW the applicable AFI 11-
      2(MDS), Volume 3 series instructions. These extensions must be coordinated with the
      AMD Mission Manager.
      3.9.4.2. Aircraft commanders will not delay a mission due to a FCCs work/rest cycle
      since FCCs are not considered aircrew. Aircraft commanders will ensure FCCs have
      access to appropriate rest facilities not being used by operating aircrews during long
      flights. Flight time is considered duty time if adequate rest facilities are not available.
      Adequate rest facilities include crew rest platforms, bunks, OSA/VIPSAM reclining
      seats, or properly installed litters. The availability of adequate rest facilitates during flight
      will be considered when determining the FCCs work/rest plan per AFI 21-101, Aircraft
      and Equipment Maintenance Management, and AMC Supplement 1 to AFI 21-101. The
      aircraft commander will ensure the FCC contacts the responsible C2 agency (i.e.,
      TACC/XOCL or 613 AMD/AMDM Logistics) to expedite the recovery of a hard broke
      aircraft that is away from home station (or that transit the home station’s AMS en route)
      and requires recovery support. The aircraft commander and the C2 agency will establish
      the FCCs and MRTs (if required) work/rest cycle that maintain safe work/rest
      parameters, but are based on the recovery requirements (receipt of supplies, equipment,
      etc). This relationship ensures the aircraft commander is not disturbed during crew rest to
      address the FCCs work schedule, adds velocity to the aircraft’s recovery principally
      through direct communication and ensures the C2 agency has effective control over the
      recovery. It is essential that the FCC/MRT remain in contact with the C2 agency
      throughout the recovery. Further guidance on FCC/MRT responsibilities are delineated in
      Chapter 12.
3.10. Early Departures. Early departures must be coordinated and approved by the AMD
Mission Manager and will be IAW applicable AFI 11-2(MDS), Volume 3 series instructions.
 22                                                             PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010


   3.10.1. Early departures for frequency channel missions are normally limited to no more
   than 30- minutes from scheduled departure time. However, should sound judgment dictate
   (i.e., weather, threat, ATC restriction, airfield closures, etc.) an earlier departure may be
   authorized by the controlling agency (AMD or TACC).
   3.10.2. Unless an early departure is authorized, early arrivals must be held until scheduled
   arrival time.
   3.10.3. Distinguished visitor (DV) support missions may deviate from their planned
   schedule in support of the DVs itinerary; however, the aircraft commander is responsible for
   ensuring proper coordination is accomplished (i.e., DIPCLRs, routings, PPRs, command post
   notifications, etc.) with the AMD Mission Manager.
3.11. 65th Airlift Squadron. Procedures may vary for 65 AS EAS missions due to their unique
mission requirements. Normally, the AMD EAS Planners will load these missions into GDSS
NLT 72-hours prior to mission execution. Once the mission is in execution, the aircraft
commander will ensure the AMD Mission Manager is kept abreast of mission status, including
any changes to DV/staff and/or crew loads.
   3.11.1. The 65 AS aircrew will contact the AMD Mission Manager (see paragraph 1.6)
   directly to ensure all pertinent information to include: takeoff/landing times, any delay
   codes/remarks, takeoff gross weight, payload, MEL/CDL, maintenance status or other
   required data is relayed to the AMD Mission Manager. This also permits resolution of
   maintenance problems by AMD Logistics and the contracted logistics support (CLS)
   maintenance team.
3.12. En Route Support. For airlift missions transiting PACAF bases, PACAF Command
Posts or AMCCs will contact the necessary support agencies to meet the aircraft upon landing,
and provide any additional support requested by the crew. Types of en route support include:
maintenance or transient alert, crew transportation, cargo preparations (contingent on cargo load
changes), customs and agriculture and fleet service. PACAF C-17, C-130 and KC-135 aircraft on
a TWCF mission will be supported by the tenant AMCC (if assigned) at PACAF bases.
   3.12.1. Additionally, the landing, takeoff, and delay codes (if required) should be updated in
   GDSS within 15-minutes after the takeoff, landing or when a delay occurs. If unable to
   update, or update in a timely manner, contact the AMD Mission Manager (see paragraph 1.6)
   to coordinate data entry.
   3.12.2. When a PACAF aircraft lands at a base without a PACAF Command Post or AMCC
   and is conducting an off-station JA/ATT, exercise, or training mission, etc., the aircraft
   commander (or designated representative) will call their home base command post with
   landing times and reason(s) for any delay(s), if applicable. At this time, procedures and alert
   times (i.e., self-alert or command post alerting), weather, flight plans, and any other mission
   support requirements for subsequent mission legs will be coordinated between the command
   post and aircraft commander. If the home base command post cannot enter required
   information into GDSS, the aircrew will contact the AMD Mission Manager for data entry.
3.13. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP).
   3.13.1. Responsibility. HQ PACAF/A3T is responsible for oversight and management of
   PACAF’s MEP program.
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                      23


   3.13.2. Applicability. AMD civilian government employees or civilian contractors will only
   be authorized MEP status if their employment, company contract with the USAF, or an AFI
   verifies the requirement for the Air Force to provide airlift or for orientation flights aboard
   aircraft directly related to their duties. For guidance, refer to AFI 11-401, Aviation
   Management and PACAF Guidance Memorandum 1 to AFI 11-401.
3.14. Conference HOTEL. Conference HOTEL is a communications conference available to
aircraft commanders to assist in coping with an in-flight emergency/condition that requires
expertise not available aboard the aircraft. Only the aircraft commander may request that a
conference be established. Conferences are convened at the lowest level having the required
expertise. When expertise is not available locally, AMD should be contacted for assistance (i.e.,
if convening a conference for an aircraft type other than that operated by the parent wing or a
transient aircraft at non-flying PACAF units). Do not elevate this conference for the sole purpose
of keeping HHQ informed.
   3.14.1. Wing commanders will ensure their command post has the required communications
   infrastructure to provide the capability of rapidly convening a Conference HOTEL. This
   capability must entail the ability to phone patch and conference call several people at one
   time.
   3.14.2. Command post chiefs/superintendents will ensure a quick-reference checklist (QRC)
   is developed with established procedures to include contact information derived from MCI
   11-463, Operations Supervision. This QRC will be coordinated with all concerned agencies
   involved in establishing and conducting a Conference HOTEL.
   3.14.3. Aircraft commanders will request a Conference HOTEL from the nearest unit
   command post, AMCC, AMD or TACC and provide the following information (time
   permitting):
       3.14.3.1. Aircraft type/tail number/call sign or mission number.
       3.14.3.2. Description of situation/actions already taken/intentions.
       3.14.3.3. Fuel on board in hours.
       3.14.3.4. Position/altitude/flight conditions.
       3.14.3.5. Number of personnel/DVs and class/type and quantity of cargo.
       3.14.3.6. Aircraft commander qualifications (AC, IP).
       3.14.3.7. Planned landing base and estimated time of arrival (ETA).
       3.14.3.8. Expertise required/special requirements.
   3.14.4. When a Conference HOTEL is requested, the command post will immediately
   initiate actions to establish the conference. The number of participants may vary according to
   the situation and problem involved but as a minimum, will include the aircraft's home
   command post. The aircraft's home unit command post will then contact the aircraft's home
   base personnel to include the unit squadron commander, director of operations/operations
   group commander, aircrew standardization/evaluation, maintenance operations center
   (MOC), and weather. After initiating the call controllers will stress that the problem involves
   an airborne emergency and requires technical assistance.

   3.14.5. Each month, PACAF Command Posts will exercise/evaluate Conference HOTEL
   procedures with all local conferees and log the results and any follow-up actions. Evaluation
   factors include conferee availability, readability, voice communication quality, and the
   amount of time taken to establish the conference. Conferences must be established within 10-
   minutes of notification. Once a quarter, conference tests will be conducted with the next
   HHQ.
3.15. Prime Knight Program. This USAF program was developed to ensure high quality and
consistent transportation, lodging, and food service support to transient aircrews. The quality of
service depends upon timely notification to the host program manager of aircrew requirements.
The program is mandatory for all transient aircrews, no matter the type of mission (O&M or
TWCF) being executed (REF: AFI 34-246, Air Force Lodging Program, and AMC Supplement
to AFI 34-246). The AMS’s AMCC will coordinate with the 613 AOC/AMD Mission Manager
when local events impact a USTRANSCOM TWCF mission (a.k.a. AMC mission) under
AMD’s command-and-control; conversely, AMD Mission Managers will coordinate changes
with the AMCC.

                                 CHANNEL OPERATIONS

4.1. Common User Airlift. PACAF C-130s and C-17s, and to a lesser extent PACAF KC-
135s, are part of the DODs common user airlift system. This system is designed to provide
transportation services on a common basis for two or more DOD agencies and, when as
authorized, non-DOD agencies. This allows any authorized service or agency to use the Air
Force’s limited airlift resources to move cargo and passengers when they pay for it. Common
User missions are funded through the Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) system.
The TWCF system was set up by the DOD for users of all modes of transportation (air, land, or
sea). USTRANSCOM maintains overall responsibility for administering the TWCF program.
USTRANSCOM, in turn, designated Air Mobility Command (AMC) as the executive agent for
TWCF for common user airlift. Airlift TWCF missions are separated into four categories/types:
channels, special assignment airlift missions (SAAM), contingencies, and exercises.
4.2. Channel Missions. Joint Publication 4-01, defines channel airlift as ―Common-user airlift
service provided on a scheduled basis between two points. There are two types of channel airlift.
A requirements channel serves two or more points on a scheduled basis depending upon the
volume of traffic; a frequency channel is time based and serves two or more points at regular
intervals.‖
4.3. Channel Mission Validation. Channel missions must be validated by the respective joint
command responsible for an AOR. USPACOM, in conjunction with the service component co-
validator (primary channel user), validates all channel missions in the USPACOM AOR.
   4.3.1. USPACOM J43, in coordination with its service components and TACC/XOG,
   determines channel mission requirements within the USPACOM AOR. These requirements
   include routing and frequency of missions based on customer requirements.
   4.3.2. TACC publishes a monthly AMC Channel Sequence Listing, which lists all the
   validated channel destinations, by station name or location. Frequency channel missions can
   be both passenger and cargo-bookable, while requirements channels are generated to move
   cargo only.
4.4. AMD Responsibilities. Frequency channel missions flown by PACAF aircraft (or units
that AMD coordinates with to fly PACAF missions) are entered into GDSS by AMD Airlift
Planners. PAX-bookable frequency channels are scheduled and entered into GDSS 90-days prior
to mission execution. Cargo-bookable only frequency channel missions are scheduled and
entered into GDSS 30-days prior to mission execution.
   4.4.1. The AMD Airlift Planners will only schedule a requirements channel when requested
   by TACC/XOG (offshore bookies) and coordinated with AMD Requirements. TACC/XOG,
   normally contacts AMD Requirements for an aircraft when an excessive cargo backlog at
   AN AMS en route station.
4.5. Re-routing and Changing Frequency Channel Missions. It is generally not desirable to
change the frequency channel as they are planned well in advance and scheduled to fly on
specific days at specific times. Especially since these missions are PAX-bookable, meaning that
duty personnel are given tickets to board these aircraft, as if they were on a scheduled
 26                                                               PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010


commercial flight. However, if a high enough priority exists, changing or re-routing a frequency
channel mission is possible provided the changes are coordinated with the customer,
TACC/XOG, AMD Requirements, APCC, and down line stations (ATOCs and CATOs). Note:
Frequency channels should only be changed as a last resort if no other resource exists for filling
a customer request.
   4.5.1. Long term restructuring of channel missions is also possible and sometimes necessary.
   Since all channel missions are driven by customer requirements, a thorough analysis must
   document a need for deleting, restructuring, or adding a frequency channel. As the day-to-
   day execution and C2 agency, AMD is positioned to determine customer requirements and
   pass this information to USPACOM J43. However, USPACOM J43 is the final authority to
   determine customer requirements for newly developed channel airlift missions. In addition,
   all changes or additions to the existing channel airlift structure must be coordinated and
   agreed to by TACC/XOG.
4.6. Wing and Unit Responsibilities. Upon receipt of a GDSS Mission Detail, the tasked wing
current operations office will check the scheduled itinerary for errors or omissions, and pass the
tasking to the flying unit to ensure crews are scheduled to fly the mission. In addition to taskings
in other sections, and normal execution, the tasked wing will:
   4.6.1. Ensure the aircraft tail number, call sign and aircraft commander’s name are loaded
   into the GDSS system NLT 24-hours prior to estimated time of departure (ETD). If the local
   C2 system is not operational, the command post controller will notify the AMD Mission
   Manager by telephone and request assistance in loading the information into GDSS.
   4.6.2. Send crewmember names and passport information to the AMD Airlift Planners or
   appropriate agency [United States defense attaché office (USDAO) or JPAC], as required.
   4.6.3. Confirm final aircraft configuration, itinerary, operating times, and load information
   with user and the AMD Airlift Planners.
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                       27

         SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT AIRLIFT MISSION (SAAM) OPERATIONS

5.1. General Information. The second type of TWCF mission (reference paragraph 4.1) is the
SAAM. Joint Publication 1-02, DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms and Joint
Publication 4-01 defines special assignment airlift requirements as ―Airlift requirements,
including CJCS-directed or coordinated exercises, that require special consideration because of
the number of passengers involved, weight or size of cargo, urgency of movement, sensitivity, or
other valid factors that preclude the use of channel airlift.‖
5.2. SAAM Validation Process. The SAAM process begins when the user submits an airlift
request for validation. Each service component command has its own validator, normally located
in the Logistics Directorate. Within PACAF, the two validators are PACAF/A4RDC and
13AF/A4O. PACAF/A4RDC is the Air Force component validator who validates requests from
all Air Force units assigned to PACAF. The 13 AF/A40 validates requests for contingencies and
deployments.
5.3. AMD Responsibilities. AMD is responsible for planning and scheduling airlift to meet
validated SAAM requests.
   5.3.1. Upon receipt of a validated SAAM request from AMD Requirements, the responsible
   AMD planning cell reviews scheduling forecasts and contacts wing current operations to
   confirm the availability of aircraft and aircrew to support the mission. The responsible AMD
   planning cell provides status of aircraft availability to AMD Requirements who will either
   support or non-support a mission based on overall airlift capability or the 96-hour criteria for
   C-130s. AMD Requirements will allocate aircraft using the JCS-priority (see Joint
   Publication 4-01) assigned by the validator.
       5.3.1.1. If AMD is unable to support a SAAM during the requested period, AMD
       Requirements will contact the user to try to find another mutually agreeable date.
       5.3.1.2. If the user cannot be contacted, AMD Requirements will notify the validating
       agency that the SAAM cannot be supported.
   5.3.2. If supportable, the responsible AMD planning cell will build a GDSS Mission Detail
   and E-mail a copy to the supporting wing’s current operations office. In addition, they will
   accomplish other required planning such as: build computer flight plans and submit requests
   for TERPs, DIPCLRs and PPRs; coordinate flyaway security with PACAF/A7, as required;
   and confirm aircraft configuration.
   5.3.3. In some cases, the responsible AMD planning cell may provide the flying unit verbal
   tasking to expedite placing a crew(s) in crew rest to facilitate a short-notice mission (e.g.,
   search and rescue). The planner will follow up all verbal taskings by generating a GDSS
   Mission Detail, which is then forwarded to the respective wing current operations.
   5.3.4. At the end of each month, AMD Airlift Planners will forward a SAAM recap to
   AMC/FMFAB. This recap will list the mission number, whether the mission qualifies for a
   ten percent discount, billing information, and include remarks for missions cancelled or
   significantly changed.
 28                                                               PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010


5.4. Wing and Unit Responsibilities. Upon receipt of a GDSS Mission Detail, the tasked wing
current operations office will check the scheduled itinerary for errors or omissions, and pass the
tasking to the flying unit to ensure crews are scheduled to fly the mission. In addition to taskings
in other sections, and normal execution, the tasked wing will:
   5.4.1. Ensure the aircraft tail number, call sign and aircraft commander’s name are loaded
   into the GDSS system NLT 24-hours prior to estimated time of departure (ETD). If the local
   C2 system is not operational, the command post controller will notify the AMD Mission
   Manager by telephone and request assistance in loading the information into GDSS.
   5.4.2. Send crewmember names and passport information to the AMD Airlift Planners or
   appropriate agency [United States defense attaché office (USDAO) or JPAC], as required.
   5.4.3. Confirm final aircraft configuration, itinerary, operating times, and load information
   with user and the AMD Airlift Planners.
   5.4.4. Prior to execution of all JCS-priority one (1) SAAM missions, the squadron operations
   officer will provide the aircraft commander with a face-to-face briefing covering mission
   details and other applicable information and regulations as required.
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                         29


                                            Chapter 6

                     CONTINGENCY/CJCS EXERCISE OPERATIONS

6.1. General Information. The last two categories of TWCF are contingency and CJCS
exercise missions. Joint Publication 1-02 defines a contingency as ―A situation requiring military
operations in response to natural disasters, terrorists, subversives, or as otherwise directed by
appropriate authority to protect US interests.‖ Contingency operations, by their very nature,
normally require a rapid response and special procedures to ensure mission safety and the
readiness of personnel, installations, and equipment.
6.2. Contingency and Exercise Mission Validation. CJCS Exercise and Contingency mission
requirements are identified in the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES),
through the use of the TPFDD. In building the TPFDD, each service component identifies what
forces they need to deploy in order to accomplish their assigned task. After deciding what forces
are required, a determination is made on the mode of transportation, which will be used to move
the forces, as well as date they are available to move, and the earliest and latest required delivery
dates. The supported MAJCOM validates the movement requirements once they are entered into
JOPES. Movement requirements mode source coded ―AD‖ require a minimum of 30 passengers
or 5 short tons. Movement requirements mode source coded ―AK‖ require a minimum of 100
passengers or 15 short tons. Requirements that do not meet the minimum load criteria will be
worked on a case-by-case basis. For both exercises and contingencies, AMD Requirements
passes requirements for movements using theater-assigned air mobility assets to the respective
AMD planning cell (airlift or tanker).
6.3. AMD Responsibilities. The responsible AMD planning cell is responsible for planning
and scheduling airlift to meet validated exercise and contingency requests. This process is very
similar to that outlined for a SAAM in Chapter 5.
   6.3.1. Upon receipt of a validated contingency or exercise request, the responsible AMD
   planning cell reviews scheduling forecasts and contact wing current operations to confirm the
   availability of aircraft and aircrew to support the mission. The responsible AMD planning
   cell will either support or non-support a mission based on overall airlift capability. The JCS-
   priority for contingency missions (usually ―1B1‖) is normally such that they will be flown as
   tasked.
       6.3.1.1. If AMD is unable to support a contingency or exercise mission during the
       requested time period, AMD Requirements will contact the user to try to find another
       mutually agreeable date.
       6.3.1.2. If the user cannot be contacted, AMD Requirements will notify the validating
       agency that the mission cannot be supported. Normally, a change in the requested
       date/time of an exercise mission maybe enough to accommodate most requests.
   6.3.2. If supportable, the responsible AMD planning cell will build a GDSS Mission Detail
   and E-mail a copy to the supporting wing’s current operations office. In addition, they will
   accomplish other planning functions such as: build computer flight plans and submit requests
   for TERPs, DIPCLRs and PPRs; coordinate flyaway security, as required; and confirm
   aircraft configuration.
 30                                                             PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010


   6.3.3. In some cases, especially contingencies, the responsible AMD planning cell may
   provide the flying unit a verbal tasking to expedite placing crews in crew rest to facilitate a
   short-notice mission. The planner will follow up all verbal taskings with a GDSS Mission
   Detail, then forward the GDSS Mission Detail to wing current operations and the flying unit.
6.4. Wing and Unit Responsibilities. Upon receipt of a GDSS Mission Detail, the tasked wing
current operations office will check the scheduled itinerary for errors or omissions, and pass the
tasking to the flying unit to ensure crews are scheduled to fly the mission. In addition to normal
execution, the tasked wing will:
   6.4.1. Ensure the aircraft tail number, call sign and aircraft commander’s name is loaded into
   GDSS system NLT 24-hours prior to ETD. If the local GDSS system is not operational, the
   unit command post controller will notify the AMD Mission Manager by telephone and
   request assistance in loading the information in to GDSS.
   6.4.2. Send crewmember names and passport information to the AMD Airlift Planners or
   appropriate agency (USDAO or JPAC), as required.
   6.4.3. Confirm final aircraft configuration, itinerary, operating hours, and load information
   with user and the AMD Airlift Planners.
6.5. CJCS Exercises. These exercises are designed to test the capability of our contingency
airlift commitment. The success of our airlift performance is graded not only on departure
reliability, but also our ability to meet the PAX/cargo delivery requirements NLT the LAD.
   6.5.1. CJCS exercise/contingency departure reliability is based on the published schedule
   versus actual departure time. Any CJCS exercise/contingency mission that exceeds the
   departure time by more than 14-minutes is considered to have operated in delay. Expeditious
   handling of aircraft running behind schedule is critical for PACAF to demonstrate its
   wartime capability.
   6.5.2. Early departures may be approved only after concurrence by the user, down line
   CREs/ stations and approval of the AMD Mission Manager.
   6.5.3. Overflight of en route fuel/opportune cargo stops may be approved, if there is no
   movement requirement and: DIPCLRs are not violated; the destination’s operations hours
   and maximum on ground (MOG) are not violated; the scheduled airfields are advised of the
   decision to overfly; and the request is approved by the AMD Senior Director.
   6.5.4. Within 24-hours of execution, CJCS exercise/contingency missions will not normally
   be recut except by the AMD Mission Manager and, if deemed necessary, after coordination
   with AMD Airlift Planners.
   6.5.5. Airdrop, air refueling, and en route support team (EST) missions may require
   adjustments to the active leg(s) to meet scheduled timing (time over target, ARCT) or user
   requirements. When the adjusted timing exceeds the scheduled departure plus 14-minutes,
   the AMD Mission Manager may re-cut these specific exercise missions to reflect actual time
   of departure after appropriate coordination, and explain the reason for re-cut in the remarks
   section of the GDSS Mission Detail.
   6.5.6. Timely communications are essential to airlift flow management. Inbound crews must
   notify command posts/centers/CREs of their maintenance status, cargo offload, estimated
   fuel onload, and any other support requirements.
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                       31


   6.5.7. CJCS exercise/contingency offload reliability is also based on published schedule
   versus actual arrival time at the offload station. An early arrival or scheduled arrival plus 2-
   hours is considered on time for exercise reliability.
6.6. Exercise Priorities. For contingency operations and CJCS exercises, USPACOM J31 will
provide the CJCS priority, operation name, and supported OPLAN information for combatant
commander (COCOM) aircraft. For operational control (OPCON) aircraft, TACC/XOBA
provides this data. The TACC contingency cell will provide the mission symbols for Air Force
technical order (AFTO) Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document entry.
   6.6.1. Contingency airlift mission priorities are normally 1B1 or 1B2. CJCS exercise airlift
   missions priorities are 2B1 or 2B2.
   6.6.2. CJCS exercise missions will use "X" in the third character of the AMC mission
   number. The eighth and ninth characters will designate specific exercises. Identifying
   characters for contingencies varies.
   6.6.3. CJCS exercises will use "L" for the first alpha-numeric character of the mission
   symbol as logged in AFTO Form 781. The second and third characters will designate specific
   operations/exercises.
       6.6.3.1. CJCS exercises/contingencies are billed based on mission symbols. It is critical
       for aircrews to log the correct mission symbol in the AFTO Form 781.
   6.6.4. Contingency Operations will use "C" or "P" for the first alpha-numeric character of
   the mission symbol as logged in AFTO Form 781. The second and third characters will
   designate specific operation.
6.7. Transportation Policies. Provisions in AFIM 24-204, Chapter 3, Preparing Hazardous
Materials for Military Air Shipments, when approved, apply to contingency and CJCS exercise
missions transporting hazardous/explosive cargo. Users are responsible for informing ATOC of
the type and quantity of hazardous cargo as well as arranging for any special handling
requirements.
6.8. Safety. During exercise operations, skills and procedures necessary to successfully execute
a contingency or emergency plan are practiced. This may include user requests for non-standard
operations. If a user requests an operation that deviates from standard directives, the aircraft
commander, after an operational risk analysis, will determine if operations will still be safe. If
operations are determined safe, the aircraft commander may obtain a waiver from HQ
PACAF/A3, prior to conducting the operation. Under no circumstances will ground or flight
safety be compromised. If unusual problems or hazards are encountered, contact the nearest
CRE, command post, or local base safety representative. In matters of flight safety, the aircraft
commander's decision is final.

 EXECUTIVE AIRLIFT SUPPORT (EAS) AND OPERATIONAL SUPPORT AIRLIFT
                        (OSA) OPERATIONS

7.1. EAS Background. PACAF EAS missions are dedicated executive airlift in support of
CDRUSPACOM and other selected DV Codes 2 and 3/senior leader travelers. These travelers
are required to use military airlift (MILAIR) due to one or more of the following: a continuous
requirement for secure communications; for security; or for responsive transportation to satisfy
exceptional scheduling requirements dictated by frequent short-notice travel, which makes
commercial transportation impracticable. Scheduling, planning, and tasking support for
PACAF’s EAS requirements is provided by the AMD EAS Planners.
7.2. EAS Scope. Two EAS aircraft, a C-37A and a C-40B, are assigned to the 15th Airlift
Wing’s 65th Airlift Squadron at Hickam AFB, Hawaii to meet the transportation needs of
CDRUSPACOM and other selected DV-2 and DV-3 and designated senior leader travelers.
Requests for support are coordinated by the traveler’s respective staff and forwarded to the AMD
EAS Planners.
7.3. EAS Operations. The priority for utilizing PACAF EAS aircraft is determined IAW
appropriate priority listings and with the concurrence of CDRUSPACOM and COMPACAF.
   7.3.1. The AMD EAS Planners task the 15 AW for airlift support by the 65 AS. The DVs
   staff initiates all mission itinerary changes through the AMD EAS Planners, who review and
   coordinate the changes with the 65 AS, and then provide updated itineraries to all concerned
   parties. Prior to mission execution, the AMD EAS Planners ensure all mission planning is
   complete and any critical issues are resolved to include appropriate DIPCLRs for DIP-
   cleared routes (and revised DIPCLRs due to deviations while in execution), flight plans,
   PPRs, itinerary times, ground times, airfield weight-bearing issues, TERPs, payload, airfield
   operational hours, airfield suitability, NOTAMs, waivers, fuel requirements and type,
   Logbook entries, etc. During mission execution, the AMD Flight Manager and Mission
   Manager provide flight dispatch and C2 services, IAW Chapter 2 and Chapter 13 of this
   instruction. The AMD Flight Manager and Mission Manager will coordinate with the AMD
   EAS Planners, as necessary, to effect itinerary changes, mission re-plans, new flight plans,
   new PPRs/slot times, or other support plan modifications.
       7.3.1.1. The 15 AW/15 MXG will provide the AMD EAS Planners, CDRUSPACOM
       Aide-de- Camp/Trip Coordinator, and COMPACAF Trip Coordinator an updated 90-day
       aircraft availability schedule on a weekly basis.
       7.3.1.2. The AMD EAS Planners will receive travel forecasts from CDRUSPACOM and
       COMPACAF trip coordinators and provide those forecasts and those for any other
       approved travelers to the 65 AS, 15 AW and 15 MXG as soon as possible after receipt.
       7.3.1.3. The 65 AS will ensure 735 AMS Passenger Services receives a copy of the
       passenger manifest for all EAS missions originating at Hickam AFB. Deviations to
       planned en route DV enplane/deplane information will be passed to the 15 AW
       Command Post for proper in-transit visibility (ITV) action.
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                    33


       7.3.1.4. Upon mission completion, the 65 AS will forward copies of all DV passenger
       manifests with any revisions and mission flying hours to the AMD EAS Planners for
       retention IAW DOD and JCS guidance.
       7.3.1.5. The 15 AW will ensure procedures are in place to provide timely GDSS updates
       of takeoff and landing times from Hickam AFB. En route update responsibility is through
       the PACAF Command Posts who notify the AMD Mission Manager. Aircrews will
       notify the AMD Mission Manager, in the absence of PACAF Command Posts.
       7.3.1.6. During mission execution, the 65 AS aircraft commander, or designated
       representative, will advise the AMD Mission Manager (DSN 315-448-8888) of off-
       station contact information, billeting location, contact phone or cell numbers, time crew
       will enter crew rest, and aircraft maintenance status, as applicable.
       7.3.1.7. Based on PACAF FP requirements, PACAF/A7 will task appropriate units to
       provide flyaway security (FS) or RAVENS for EAS missions. AMD EAS Planners will
       indicate required aircraft security location(s) in the GDSS Mission Detail, Remarks
       section. If other than 15 AW Security Forces Squadron (SFS) personnel, the AMD EAS
       Planners will indicate the PACAF/A7-tasked unit, number of personnel and SFS POC in
       the GDSS Mission Detail, Remarks section.
       7.3.1.8. The AMD EAS Planners plan, coordinate and task backup aircraft support for
       EAS missions only when directed by the 13 AF/CV.
          7.3.1.8.1. AMD will task PACAF units supporting EAS backup requirements.
          Mission planning support will be provided to tasked PACAF units IAW paragraph
          2.1.3 AMD will coordinate with USTC, TACC, ANG, etc, to effect non-PACAF
          aircraft back-up requirements or alternate support means, when that support is
          necessary.
          7.3.1.8.2. Required FS or RAVEN support for PACAF-assigned backup aircraft will
          be tasked by PACAF/A7. Travel and administrative coordination with the tasked
          FS/RAVEN unit is the responsibility of the unit that provides the spare aircraft.
       7.3.1.9. All training missions, including those wholly within the Hawaiian Islands, will
       be entered into GDSS and relative information updated by the 15 AW/65 AS. The 15 OG
       will inform COMPACAF when O-6 and above passengers are scheduled to be
       transported in conjunction with 65 AS off-station training missions.
       7.3.1.10. When requested, the AMD EAS Planners will enter off-station trainer missions
       into GDSS and flight follow, to include updating GDSS times, as required. Requests for
       off-station trainer mission planning assistance and flight management services within 24-
       hours of departure will be rendered on a workload-permitting basis.
7.4. 65 AS Mission Planning Responsibilities. In addition to actions outlined in paragraph 7.3,
the 65 AS mission planners will:
   7.4.1. Coordinate 65 AS aircraft travel and administrative requirements with the tasked
   FS/RAVEN unit.
   7.4.2. Assign crews to the mission and provide a crew list to include flying crew chiefs
   (FCC) and FS/RAVENs to the AMD EAS Planners in a timely manner for inclusion in
   aircraft DIPCLR request messages.
 34                                                               PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010


   7.4.3. Send personnel clearance requests for required crewmembers when staging, to include
   FS/RAVENs when traveling concurrently. Personnel clearances for FS/RAVEN names
   received outside the 65 AS message deadlines, or when traveling separately, are the
   responsibility of the supporting SFS.
   7.4.4. Obtain required visas for crewmembers.
   7.4.5. Make billeting/hotel arrangements for crewmembers and FS/RAVENs.
   7.4.6. Coordinate ground transportation, ice and water, fleet service, and aerospace ground
   equipment (AGE) requirements with providers/USDAO, as required.
   7.4.7. Keep AMD apprised of any itinerary and aircraft status changes.
   7.4.8. Upon mission completion, promptly forward the EAS Mission Feedback form to AMD
   EAS Planners electronically via the AMD website or by fax (see paragraph 1.6).
7.5. OSA Background. OSA is travel aboard aircraft procured and operated to meet high-
priority and short-notice mission requirements that cannot be satisfied by commercial
transportation, common-user airlift, or other organic airlift. In peacetime, OSA aircraft are
primarily used to provide cost-effective training and seasoning of pilots and for logistics needs to
ensure military effectiveness in support of national defense policies. OSA provides airlift support
for movement of eligible DOD passengers and cargo at no cost to authorized, validated travelers.
DOD policy limits the use of DOD transportation resources to official DOD requirements.
Managers and commanders at all levels must prevent misuse of these resources, as well as the
perception of their misuse. Rank, grade, or positions alone are not sufficient to justify support of
MILAIR requests. Dedicated OSA is not normally provided to single travelers. DOD policy
tasks OSA Validators to combine single traveler requests with other MILAIR requests to make
OSA as cost-effective as possible, to alleviate the perception of misuse and accommodate space-
available passengers and cargo on a non-interference basis. MILAIR requests for the exclusive
use of an entire aircraft for a single traveler will be considered by exception and require detailed
justification in the request. AMD OSA Planners provide centralized scheduling and planning
support for PACAF’s fixed-wing OSA requirements.
7.6. OSA Scope. The PACAF OSA fleet consists of two C-12Fs at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska,
and three C-12Js and four UH-1N helicopters stationed at Yokota AB, JA.
   7.6.1. The designated PACAF Command OSA Validator is AMD OSA, whose personnel are
   designated transportation agents IAW DOD transportation policy. Accordingly, the PACAF
   Command OSA Validator has the duty to consider the purpose, appropriateness, cost
   effectiveness, and necessity for each OSA MILAIR request, as well as the responsibility to
   assign the priority, urgency, justification, and category (PUJC) code to each properly
   approved OSA MILAIR request. The AMD OSA Planners validate OSA requests for all
   PACAF general officers, and approve and validate OSA requests for O-6 and below
   personnel assigned to HQ PACAF, 13 AF, 15 AW, and other DOD agencies and commands
   who are tenant units on Hickam AFB. If a properly approved OSA MILAIR requirement is
   received from the OSD executive secretary, assistant SECDEF for Legislative Affairs, or
   JCS, and a PUJC-code is not assigned, the PACAF-Command OSA validator will assign a
   PUJC-code before tasking a flying unit. Additional information on PACAF validators and
   responsibilities can be found in PACAFI 10-2102, PACAF Operational Support Airlift
   Management.
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                          35


7.7. OSA Operations. Detailed guidance on the PACAF Centralized OSA program is found in
PACAFI 10-2102, PACAF Operational Support Airlift Management, and the PACAF OSA
User’s Guide. Both publications are linked under ―References‖ on the AMD website (see
paragraph 1.6). The DOD OSA priority system is used to validate, task and schedule OSA
missions. Many factors, including rank, grade, position, and especially mission justification and
purpose of travel, are used to determine the priority of an OSA mission IAW DODI 4500.43,
Operational Support Airlift (OSA), AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement, and other DOD and
Service guidance. Current OSA mission schedules will be maintained in JALIS-NG, or on the
AMD OSA web site for reference by Validators and OSA flying units with established user
accounts with the controlling agency. Regrets for support will be determined and requestors
notified as soon as possible, but normally not less than three duty days prior to the start of travel,
to allow for alternate travel plans. During mission execution, C2 services are available from the
AMD Mission Manager. The AMD Mission Manager coordinates with the AMD OSA Planners,
when necessary, to effect itinerary changes.
   7.7.1. For training missions, OSA flying units or wing current operations will normally
   accomplish mission planning and support. Units will enter all training missions into GDSS
   and keep relative information current. When requested, AMD OSA Planners may assist in
   mission planning. However, requests for planning support services within 24-hours of initial
   departure will be provided only on a workload-permitting basis.
   7.7.2. The AMD OSA Planners and flying units will closely coordinate flying training and
   aircraft maintenance schedules to ensure sufficient opportunity exists for flying units to
   accomplish desired training and maintain currency, while meeting theater OSA needs.
7.8. OSA Flying Unit Responsibilities. In addition to the coordination actions addressed in
paragraph 7.7, OSA unit planners will:
   7.8.1. Provide aircrew, CLS maintenance technician, passport and weapon information, etc.
   to AMD OSA Planners for all missions that require DIPCLRs.
   7.8.2. Obtain any required visas for the pilots and confirm all accompanying MEPs,
   maintenance technicians and FS/RAVENs have required visas.
   7.8.3. Make billeting/hotel arrangements for crewmembers, or provide crewmember
   billeting/hotel requirements, to AMD OSA Planners, when requested in conjunction with the
   aircraft DIPCLR request and/or USDAO coordination.
   7.8.4. Coordinate ground transportation, ice and water, fleet service, and AGE requirements
   with providers/USDAO, as required, or provide to AMD OSA Planners when requested in
   conjunction with the aircraft DIPCLR request or USDAO coordination.
   7.8.5. Obtain/maintain passenger lists and pass changes to scheduled passenger/cargo
   onload/offload information to the applicable C2 facility, to include AMD for tasked missions,
   when transiting locations without DOD facilities capable of those services.
   7.8.6. Upon mission completion, promptly forward the OSA Mission Feedback form to
   AMD OSA Planners electronically via the AMD website by fax (see paragraph 1.6) or
   complete the End of Mission report in JALIS-NG, as appropriate.

  7.8.7. Provide AMD OSA Planners with quarterly aircraft maintenance schedules and
  weekly updates when appropriate, as well as local and HHQ exercise schedules, which may
  impact mission scheduling.

 JOINT AIRBORNE/AIR TRANSPORTABILITY TRAINING (JA/ATT) OPERATIONS

8.1. General Information. JA/ATT is a DOD-regulated, JCS-directed, Air Force managed and
funded program designed to provide airborne and proficiency/continuation training in a joint
environment. JA/ATT offers the services an opportunity to jointly develop tactics, knowledge
and procedures necessary to increase proficiency in airdrop, assault landing, and mobility
operations. By doing so, this ensures joint combat readiness of DOD forces.
8.2. Concept of Operations. PACAF JA/ATT is an integral part of aircrew continuation
training required to maintain the combat ready status of US forces as well as aircrew mission
ready status. The skills and tactics developed in the unilateral training environment are sharpened
and refined during joint operations. For most aircrew, JA/ATT represents the first opportunity to
train with those service components with whom they will deploy, operate and support in time of
war or military operations other than war.
   8.2.1. When planning PACAF JA/ATT missions, attempt to accommodate the maximum
   number of training events for participating provider and user. PACAF has not designated
   ―Mission Critical JA/ATTs‖ that must be supported before other JA/ATTs are filled. PACAF
   prioritizes the support of competing requirements based on the JA/ATT Point System in
   Table 8.1

Table 8.1. JA/ATT Point System.

   8.2.2. Use the following as planning guidance to create the most effective training:
       8.2.2.1. JA/ATT missions should provide multiple training events per hour of flight time.
       8.2.2.2. Plan missions to operate in a simulated combat environment.
       8.2.2.3. Combat tactics and techniques should be used whenever possible, as long as they
       remain within peacetime restrictions.
 38                                                                PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010


       8.2.2.4. Plan missions to simulate austere operating conditions, however, better support
       will be realized if operations are conducted from air bases. Minimum CRE/aerial port
       support will be used and, whenever possible, a combat-operating environment simulated.
       Plan missions in conjunction with mobility exercises to test readiness and prepare for
       combat employment readiness inspections (CERI).
   8.2.3. It is imperative that airdrop forces and PACAF air mobility assets maintain
   proficiency and currency in joint airdrop. Air mobility units are encouraged as much as
   possible to make joint airdrop a priority of their semi-annual training plan in order to gain the
   highest level of interoperability and wartime readiness.
8.3. AMD Duties and Responsibilities. AMD Airlift Planners will verify that higher priority
JA/ATTs, based on the point system, are supported when two competing requirements exist.
Where possible, the AMD will:
   8.3.1. Host quarterly JA/ATT meetings (teleconference, VTCs, conferences), as required.
   Meetings will be announced by E-mail from AMD to all registered users and providers in the
   USPACOM AOR. This notification will be sent NLT 30-days prior to the meeting allowing
   time for users and providers to schedule requests. Conferences, when held, will last two days
   to give attendees sufficient opportunity to tour facilities and meet personnel associated with
   Pacific theater airlift. To register as a JA/ATT provider or user, click on the following URL;
   https://www.ops.hickam.af.mil/amocc/tools/jaatt/default.asp
   8.3.2. Validate USPACOM JA/ATT requests and assign mission numbers on the PACAF
   JA/ATT home page. Requests for validation will include (AFRC, ANG and IMA) man-day
   allocation. If required man-days are not available the mission will not be validated.
   8.3.3. The AMD Airlift Planners manage the PACAF JA/ATT mission listing posted on the
   AMD website. Users build their requirements on the JA/ATT web page, after which the
   AMD Airlift Planners validate the requirement. The airlift unit that ―buys‖ the JA/ATT then
   coordinates with the user to ensure training objectives/criteria are satisfied for all parties
   involved in the event.
   8.3.4. If highlighted by the wing, review mission commander after action reports as
   necessary to highlight and correct problem areas.
   8.3.5. Maintain a list of user airlift units and support contacts for the entire theater.
   8.3.6. Manpower authorizations (MPA) man-day requests are made through the command
   man-day allocation system (CMAS) website at https://cmas.scott.af.mil. Man-days are
   sourced through PACAF/A3.
8.4. Wing and Unit Responsibilities. The following are wing specific responsibilities
regarding JA/ATT missions:
   8.4.1. The user should coordinate with the airlift unit to determine required support for
   JA/ATT mission. Support includes, but is not limited to, special tactics squadron/combat
   control team, drop zone safety officer, crash-fire-rescue, tactical airlift liaison officer,
   medical, and load recovery.
   8.4.2. The airlift unit is responsible for entering GDSS Mission Details and performing all
   planning associated with JA/ATT execution including DIPCLRs and/or country clearances,
   PPR, ASRR, NOTAM, etc.
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                   39


  8.4.3. Ensuring the aircraft tail number and aircraft commander’s name is loaded into the
  GDSS system NLT 24-hours prior to ETD. If the local GDSS system is not operational, the
  unit command post controller will notify the AMD Mission Manager by telephone and
  request assistance in loading the information in to GDSS.
  8.4.4. Advise AMD Airlift Planners when JA/ATTs are added, rescheduled or cancelled by
  an E-mail to 613aoc.amd.jaatt@hickam.af.mil
  8.4.5. Submit mission commander after action reports or sections thereof when issues arise
  that require HHQ involvement.
  8.4.6. When non-US troops are the beneficiaries of a JA/ATT mission, ensure approval is
  obtained per DOD 4515.13R, Air Transportability Eligibility, for foreign nationals to ride on
  DOD aircraft. Such missions must compete for flying hour allocations with all other theater
  requests.

                 AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION (AE) OPERATIONS

9.1. General Information. Guidance on intratheater and intertheater AE operations is
contained in JP 4-02, Health Service Support, AFI 11-2AE, Volume 3, Aeromedical Evacuation
(AE) Operations Procedures, AFI 41-301, Worldwide Aeromedical Evacuation System, and
AFTTP 3-42.5 Aeromedical Evacuation (AE).
   9.1.1. The Pacific Theater Patient Movements Requirements Center (TPMRC) is the initial
   interface point for all patient movement requirements. TPMRC is tasked with clinical and
   administrative validation of all patient movement requirements originating in USPACOM
   AOR. TPMRC provides ITV of all patient movement with the use of TRANSCOM
   Regulating and Command and Control Evacuation System (TRAC2ES). TPMRC validates
   medical equipment requirements. The theater Validating Flight Surgeon(s) (VFS) and
   TPMRC provides clinical oversight of the theater’s AE operations.
   9.1.2. The AECT is the AMD Chief's link to all aeromedical evacuation operations in the
   USPACOM AOR. The AECT provides the critical C2 link between airlift operations and
   medical/joint interface with TPMRC. AECT personnel have extensive knowledge of flight
   physiology, airlift AE capability, and information technology such as: operational mission
   planning and tasking, scheduling, and mission monitoring of airlift and AE assets to support
   patient movement. The AECT plans, coordinates, procures and flight follows routine AE
   channel and strategic AE missions as well as Urgent and Priority patient airlift missions.
   9.1.3. AECT is tasked with analyzing all potential aircraft availabilities and determining
   optimal aircraft sourcing to meet specific AE mission requirements. Once a proposed airlift
   source is identified and it is determined to best suit the patient movement requirement under
   consideration, the AMD will task the appropriate PACAF airlift agency or coordinate with
   the TACC. The AECT may coordinate airlift sourcing with the United States Coast Guard
   through the Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC) or sister service C2 agencies. The
   AECT will provide the following functions:
      9.1.3.1. Coordinate all theater patient movement requirements with the TPMRC to assure
      airlift meets patient needs.
      9.1.3.2. Ensure 18 AES and Det 1, 18 AES maintain appropriate levels of in-flight
      medical equipment to support scheduled and unscheduled AE missions.
      9.1.3.3. When required, coordinate with TACC to use strategic airlift assets for
      Urgent/Priority patient movements.
      9.1.3.4. Coordinate the PACAF AE channel mission itinerary with AMD based on
      patient requirements. Weekly mission stops may include any or all of the following:
      Yokota AB, Misawa AB, Iwakuni MCAS, Fukuoka Int’l Airport and Osan AB. The order
      of stops will be determined by patient conditions and may vary from standard routing. If
      there is no patient requirement for the weekly AE channel mission, AECT will notify the
      AMD Mission Manager of the mission’s cancelation no later than 24-hours prior to
      execution.
      9.1.3.5. Maintain current status of alert crews and aircraft.
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                 41


         9.1.3.5.1. The AECT will pass mission information, including aircraft arrival and
         departure times to the AMD Mission Manager and Senior Director, TPMRC, the 18
         AES and AES detachments, as well as the appropriate command posts and AMCCs.
         The AECT will communicate changes to TPMRC in a timely manner to ensure
         necessary adjustments of ground transportation times to/from the flight line.
         9.1.3.5.2. The AECT will flight follow the mission and all operational aspects of AE
         and will notify the AMD Senior Director of all alert gaps. The AECT will ensure the
         AMD Chief is advised when alert gaps greater than 13-hours exist and when the
         Bravo Alert aircraft is generated.
  9.1.4. AE Mission Cut/Mission Planning. These duties are shared between AMDs
  Airlift/Tanker Planners, Flight/Mission Managers and the AECT, as appropriate. Once the
  mission is planned, the AMD Mission Manager will notify the appropriate command post to
  schedule alert times for aircrew (front-end and AE crew). Missions that originate out of
  Hickam AFB will be coordinated by the AECT with Det 1, 18 AES. The AMD will provide
  the following functions:
     9.1.4.1. Control PACAF AE assets during execution, determine method to accomplish
     mission, make final airlift decisions, schedule airlift routes and missions, and task
     mission to appropriate agency. For weekly AE channel missions, if no patient
     requirement exists, AECT will notify the Mission Manager of the mission’s cancelation
     NLT 24-hours prior to execution. The AMD Mission Manager will then notify the
     respective command posts that the mission was canceled.
     9.1.4.2. Provide support for all active PACAF AE missions, and will support AMC AE
     missions as requested by TACC (maintenance support, IFM mission packages, waivers,
     PPRs, etc.)
     9.1.4.3. Provide all planning and coordination for PACAF Alert KC-135 launches
     (mission cut, DIPCLRs, IFM mission packages, ground servicing coordination, FCG
     requirements, ASRR, PPRs, TERPs validation, etc.).
     9.1.4.4. Determine where alert crews will be pre-positioned/staged throughout theater to
     meet requirements. In the event of typhoon evacuation, inputs should be provided to
     affected agencies prior to the convening of wing strike meetings.
     9.1.4.5. Flight follows all active AE missions.
     9.1.4.6. Enter all intra-theater channel AE missions into GDSS on a quarterly basis.
     When aircraft fuel servicing is planned for en route stops on routine missions, the
     standard PACAF AE turn-time is 2+00 hours. Standard PACAF AE turn-time for en
     route stops without aircraft servicing (deplaning/enplaning patients only) is 1+00 hour.
  9.1.5. Units tasked with AE missions will:
     9.1.5.1. Provide qualified crews and properly configured aircraft to execute channel and
     Urgent/Priority theater AE missions. The MCD is responsible for communicating any
     and all mission delays to the AECT without delay. In the event the delay is due to
     correcting a medical emergency, utilize alternate non-medical crew to make the
     notification.
 42                                                              PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010


       9.1.5.2. Enter crew data into GDSS. Note: Short-notice or alert KC-135s may require
       direct coordination between AMD and the tasked wing to determine which agency will
       perform support functions. Flexibility is essential to ensure mission accomplishment.
   9.1.6. PACAF Command Posts:
       9.1.6.1. The following is applicable if there is not an AMCC tenant unit located at the
       base:
          9.1.6.1.1. Ensure aircraft and aircrew information is in GDSS, and flight follow all
          AE missions that transit their location through GDSS.
          9.1.6.1.2. Provide coordination for ground servicing and aircrew support to include
          transportation for front-end and AE crews and FCCs, station support (as required),
          and other support as requested by the aircrew or directed by AMD.
          9.1.6.1.3. Notify appropriate units of HHQs AE tasking for Urgent and Priority AE
          missions.
          9.1.6.1.4. Provide alert notification to AE crews that remain overnight at their
          station. Due to possible patient requirements that may require deviation from normal
          crew rest and alert times, the aircraft commander [after consulting with the medical
          crew director (MCD)] must provide the legal for alert time to the command post for
          the next leg of the mission. Crews will not self-alert at locations with available
          command post functions.
          9.1.6.1.5. Coordinate with AMD for any additional support required or identified.
9.2. Alert Requirements. As a minimum, the 18 AES must have one crew in Bravo alert at all
times to support unscheduled Urgent and Priority AE missions. Ideally, two flight nurses (FN)
and three aeromedical evacuation technicians (AET) will be on alert at all times. This
combination maximizes mission flexibility and provides for augmented crews, when required.
However, at least one FN and two AETs (a short crew) must be on alert at all times. When a
crew is alerted, or identified to be alerted, additional AE crewmembers (AECM) will be placed
into crew rest to maximize theater alert coverage.
   9.2.1. Alert requirements at Hickam AFB. As a minimum, the 18 AES must have one crew
   in Bravo alert to support unscheduled urgent and priority AE missions. This requirement may
   be fulfilled with one FN and two AETs. A crew may sit alert for up to 48-hours, enter crew
   rest, and then be reconstituted 12-hours later. Det 1, 18 AES, may coordinate additional/gap
   coverage by request thru HQ AFRC for AE support. Funding will be in PACAF MPA or if
   approved by AFRC, Annual Tour. Ideally, there will be at least one AE short crew on alert at
   all times. When this is not possible, Det 1 will notify the AECT without delay.
   9.2.2. As a minimum, one 18 WG KC-135 must be fully mission-capable (FMC) and
   dedicated to the AE alert requirement 24-hours a day. This aircraft must be at home station or
   within 90- minute’s response from Kadena AB. The alert aircraft may be used for inter-
   theater/strategic or intra-theater movement if an in-system select aircraft is unable to provide
   an airlift solution that meets patient time constraints as determined by the TPMRC/VFS. The
   final decision will be coordinated between the AMD Senior Director and AECT. Minimize
   alert gaps at Kadena AB to the greatest degree possible. Once an alert AE KC-135 and front-

   end crew are alerted, or identified to be alerted, the 18 WG will generate another aircraft and
   crew within 13 hours. The AMD Senior Director is the tasking authority.
   9.2.3. When additional or alternate AE alert support is required, the AMD AECT will make
   recommendations to the AMD Senior Director who will task the appropriate airlift/air
   refueling agency.
9.3. AE SAAM Missions. The AMD Mission Manager acquires a mission number from an
AMDL Requirements database, which is then validated by AECT. The AMD Mission Manager,
prior to tasking, will coordinate with the AMD Requirements and Airlift/Air Refueling Planners
for C-17, C-130 and KC-135 AE in-system select aircraft to determine tasking levels and priority
cargo.
   9.3.1. The following procedures will apply when assigning AMC mission identifier prefixes
   to KC-135/C-130/C-17 AE missions:
       9.3.1.1. In-System Select Aircraft with No Deviations. The mission will operate with the
       channel mission number but will take an AE call-sign for the patient movement leg of the
       mission.
       9.3.1.2. In-System Select Aircraft with Deviations. If a mission is rerouted to complete
       an AE movement, the mission will be recut to operate as a SAAM and the second and
       third characters of the mission number will be the letters "L" and "M," respectively. All
       legs of an AE SAAM are cut as active legs.
9.4. Medical Emergency In-Flight. The AC will report all in-flight occurrences to the AMD
through the AECT. The AECT will establish a phone patch with the theater medical authority, if
clinically applicable. Upon completion of the mission, the MCD will contact the AECT to
coordinate follow-up actions and requirements.
9.5. End of Mission (EOM) Report. All PACAF-assigned and -gained AE crews will contact
the AECT, DSN 315-449-8378/448-1607 or Commercial (808) 449-8378/448-1607 for EOM
report. The MCD is responsible for a timely ―End of Mission/Patient Status‖ report to the AECT
at the end of each channel or unscheduled AE mission. If the AE channel mission continues over
a period of days, the MCD will pass the report at the end of each travel day. On AMC missions,
the AECT will conference in TACC for EOM reports.

         JOINT POW/MIA ACCOUNTING COMMAND (JPAC) OPERATIONS

10.1. JPAC missions. JPAC is a JCS-directed DOD Repatriation (REPAT) mission conducted
throughout the USPACOM AOR in an effort to recover remains of US Service members lost
during armed conflict. The aircraft call sign for this mission is REPAT. Landing fees and
associated airfield incidental costs at Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian airfields are paid in
cash upon landing to the host nation airfield managers. The AMD Airlift Planners will advise
aircrews supporting the JPAC mission of this requirement using the mission remarks section of
the GDSS Mission Detail.
10.2. JPAC Coordination. The AMD Airlift Planners will enter JPAC missions into GDSS
once AMD Requirements receives a validated requirement.
   10.2.1. AMD Airlift Planners, IAW DOD 4500.54G, will submit DIPCLR requests as
   mission itineraries are received from AMD Requirements. As DIPCLRs are received, AMD
   Airlift Planners will enter the clearance information into GDSS.
   10.2.2. Logistics support and concerns will be coordinated through AMD Logistics when the
   mission and aircraft are under the C2 of the AMD. A mobility readiness spares package
   (MRSP) is located at Utaphao, Thailand, and contains limited spare parts for C-130H-1
   aircraft. Contact 13 AF/A4OR or PACAF/A4R to address MRSP issues. Contact 13
   AF/A4OM or PACAF/A4M to address AGE equipment issues.

                                        TRAINING

11.1. Policy. The USAF must use flight training hours in a manner that demonstrates good
stewardship of the taxpayer's money. Both Congress and the public expect us to use our
resources accordingly. Each training mission must be structured to achieve maximum training.
Any by-product airlift opportunity resulting from our training must not degrade the intended
training in any way and must comply with applicable DOD instructions. Personnel at all levels
must prevent the misuse of air mobility resources, as well as the perception of their misuse.
   11.1.1. Off Station Training (OST) Flights. OST is defined as an O&M funded training
   mission that carries passengers or remains overnight. Ideally, OST missions should be
   completely planned and coordinated by the crew(s) being trained in concert with all wing-
   operating agencies. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring that missions are properly
   planned rests with the wing current operations. Mission planners must check and comply
   with all known guidance, such as NOTAMS, en route supplements, the FCG, and any other
   restrictions such as runway closures, PPR requirements, DIPCLRs, and station flow control
   requirements. Planners must also use GDSS station workload products (available through
   wing current operations) to deconflict their mission’s arrivals and departures, and should
   allow a 1-hour separation between their mission and other missions. Once planned, the
   mission should be flown as planned. The squadron/wing training department should conduct
   post mission reviews to determine if productivity, quality, and events were accomplished as
   planned, with the purpose of improving the quality of future training missions.
   11.1.2. Wing commanders are the approval authority for off station trainers. Prior to
   approval, commanders will carefully review each proposed trainer's itinerary to ensure it
   justifies and represents the best avenue for meeting training requirements. OST will be
   conducted at DOD or joint use airfields to the maximum extent possible. Aircrews will
   utilize government facilities (billeting, POL, etc.) to the maximum extent possible.
   11.1.3. Planning and coordination should include, but not be limited to, determining each
   day’s route of flight, fields to be visited, types of approaches and landings to be flown,
   compliance with DIPCLR constraints and ensure proper security for aircraft and crew.
11.2. Training Allocation. See Attachment 2 for the PACAF C-130 training allocation
process. See Attachment 3 and the USTRANSCOM/USPACOM C-17 Memorandum of
Agreement for the PACAF C-17 training allocation process. See AFI 11-221 and AFI 11-
221_PACAF Supp 1 for KC-135 training allocation process. OSA aircraft are 100 percent
funded from the individual flying unit’s O&M budget. The availability of OSA aircraft for
training is a joint endeavor between the AMD OSA Planners and the flying units. This effort
emphasizes the priority of critical training missions and balances the need to support high-
priority and short-notice DOD requirements.

                                          Chapter 12

                                   LOGISTICS SUPPORT

12.1. Concept of Support. AMD Logistics is PACAF’s C2 element responsible for the
recovery of PACAF flight-restricted not mission-capable (NMC) and flight–impaired partial
mission-capable (PMC) air mobility aircraft, including EAS/OSA aircraft, operating away from
home station. Refer to Aircraft Recovery Command-and-Control in Attachment 4. Upon
request, AMD Logistics will assist PACAF-assigned E-3 aircraft that are disabled off-station.
PACAF AACS units should contact AMD prior to initializing any recovery operations.
   12.1.1. AMD Logistics works in concert with various wing and MAJCOM logistics
   resource-providing organizations to develop and execute aircraft recovery plans. Recovery
   support is available 24/7 by contacting AMD Logistics or the AMD Mission Manager (see
   paragraph 1.6).
   12.1.2. PACAF Operations, Maintenance, and Mission Support Group commanders will
   ensure personnel under their control are familiar with the processes and functional
   responsibilities prescribed in this instruction. Commanders will incorporate the requirements
   found in this chapter in the unit’s FCC initial and annual training programs, and consider
   placing a copy of Attachment 4 and Attachment 6 within the aircraft’s 781-series forms for
   reference.
12.2. Purpose. This chapter establishes the functional responsibilities unique to the recovery of
AMD controlled and managed aircraft executing operational missions or O&M missions.
12.3. Command-and-Control. AMD Logistics is the sole agent authorized to task PACAF
operations and logistics resources necessary to support MRTs or couriers, supply and equipment
sourcing, and resource movement requirements to recover PACAF mobility aircraft executing
channels, SAAM and JCS-directed/approved exercises and contingencies, O&M missions or
other aircraft as directed by the AMD Chief. AMD Logistics also has the authority to task
PACAF operations and logistics resources to support recovery of missions conducted by other
USAF MAJCOMS, DOD services, federal agencies and allied nations that transient the
USPACOM AOR when directed by the AMD Senior Director.
   12.3.1. AMD Logistics collaborates with the disabled aircraft’s organization to devise the
   best recovery plan prior to tasking for supply, equipment or MRT/courier resources. Supply
   requirements will be coordinated through the applicable Supply Chain Management Group
   (SCMG).
   12.3.2. AMD Logistics will collaborate with PACAF/A4 and 13 AF/A4, if required, to
   facilitate aircraft recoveries.
12.4. Responsibilities.
   12.4.1. AMD Logistics will:
       12.4.1.1. Be directly accountable for timely aircraft recoveries and aggressive
       management of logistics support requirements for NMC/PMC aircraft away from home
       station. Maintain situational awareness with key recovery agencies through telecoms and
       E-mail.
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                   47


     12.4.1.2. Provide recovery support IAW applicable instructions, agreements and
     guidance.
        12.4.1.2.1. AMD Logistics will fully support TWCF-funded missions with an AMC
        fund-cite to cover the MRTs and couriers travel and per diem costs, and a
        transportation account code (TAC) to cover shipping costs for aircraft parts and
        equipment that are processed via a DD Form 1149, The Requisition and
        Invoice/Shipping Document, through TMO at the supplying base. Except for PACAF
        C-17s, AMD Logistics will determine and task a PACAF unit if an MRT or courier is
        required to support a TWCF-funded mission.
        12.4.1.2.2. For PACAF C-17s executing a TWCF-funded mission, AMD Logistics
        will coordinate MRT support with the 618 TACC/XOCL. If AMC does not have the
        requested maintenance capability (i.e., back shop specialties) or if a courier is
        required, AMD Logistics will task a PACAF unit to provide the recovery support.
        12.4.1.2.3. AMD Logistics will coordinate support for PACAF-active and –gained
        ANG aircraft conducting O&M missions such as off-station trainers (OST), airshows
        and guard lift. Although recovery of O&M missions is the unit’s responsibility, units
        should contact AMD Logistics for support since they possess off-station recovery
        experience and capability to collaborate support and/or coordinate transportation of
        supplies and equipment. Units are required to requisition supplies and provide the
        necessary fund-cite for MRT/couriers travel orders and TAC code for
        supply/equipment shipments. AMD Logistics can provide guidance on all recovery
        aspects.
        12.4.1.2.4. Lateral supply support will be provided per applicable supply manuals. If
        the recovery site is unable to establish the due-out document number for the supply
        asset, the home station will be responsible for establishing the due-out document
        number, and the FCC, MRT or courier will be responsible for the due-in from
        maintenance (DIFM) assets return to home station. If the recovery site is able to
        establish a due-out document number for the supply asset, the FCC is responsible for
        turning in the DIFM asset to the recovery site’s supply liaison.
     12.4.1.3. Collaborate with the aircraft commander (if not in crew rest), FCC, and home
     station production supervisor to determine recovery requirements, including local
     recovery efforts, and coordinate resumption of the mission, and interface with the home
     station MOC concerning recovery activities. To expedite recovery requirements, AMD
     Logistics may communicate directly with employed or home station production
     supervisors.
     12.4.1.4. Along with the FCC, coordinate with wing MOC and/or transient alert (TA)
     agencies at the disabled aircraft’s location and determine organic support capability.
     12.4.1.5. Collaborate with the respective AMD sections to ensure mission parameters are
     adjusted with respect to the recovery timeline.
     12.4.1.6. Generate a letter to tasked units that describes the necessary resources (e.g.,
     MRT/courier support, equipment, tooling, funding, etc.) needed to facilitate the recovery.
     The letter will be faxed or E-mailed and will identify the required skill sets, funding,
48                                                           PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010


     transportation mode, and other information as appropriate. A sample tasking letter is in
     Attachment 5.
     12.4.1.7. Maintain ITV and monitor all resources employed for a recovery from dispatch
     to their return to home station and/or resolution of parts and equipment accountability.
     Priority transportation is authorized for all resources to/from the recovery site.
     12.4.1.8. Generate a ―logistics support‖ record for each recovery under the GDSS
     Aircraft Management section, and be responsible for the accuracy, reliability, and timely
     entry and update of each summary, including the aircraft’s ETIC.
     12.4.1.9. Coordinate support for the recovery of commercial-derivative aircraft when
     requested by the CLS contractor. Normally, AMD Logistics assistance is limited, but
     they can provide the CLS contractor information on available MILAIR transportation to
     move resources (e.g., CLS contractors, equipment, tooling, etc.) and support coordination
     of flight line access or assist in other CLS contractor requirements.
     12.4.1.10. Direct cannibalization (CANN) action to meet mission needs when supplies
     are not immediately available within the USPACOM AOR. Note 1: CANNs from AFRC
     or ANG aircraft is restricted. AMD Logistics will request CANN authority through the
     AFRC Command Center or the ANG Readiness Center prior to such action. Note 2:
     AMD Logistics may at any time terminate or prohibit all CANN actions against any
     aircraft.
     12.4.1.11. Coordinate with TACC/APCC to space block MRT/couriers aboard MILAIR
     or for the use of jump seats aboard AMC-contracted aircraft (e.g., DC-8, B747, L-100
     aircraft).
  12.4.2. Aircraft Commanders will:
     12.4.2.1. Immediately notify AMD Logistics when an NMC/PMC condition prohibiting
     mission continuance is encountered. Report discrepancies, identifying them as either
     mission essential (ME) or mission contributing (MC), using Chapter 4 guidance specified
     in the aircraft’s AFI 11-2 series, Volume 3 instruction.
     12.4.2.2. Be available, unless restricted by crew duty day, to receive daily status
     recovery briefings from the FCC, courier or MRT team chief. Advise AMD Logistics of
     contact numbers. Establish the FCCs work/rest cycle with AMD Logistics.
     12.4.2.3. To the maximum extent possible, make resources under their control available
     to the FCC, courier or MRT Team Chief in order to facilitate the recovery. These
     resources include, but are not limited to, manpower and communications devices such as
     an Iridium phone.
  12.4.3. Aircraft FCC and/or MRT Team Chief will:
     12.4.3.1. Immediately notify AMD Logistics when a NMC/PMC condition prohibiting
     mission continuance is discovered. Refer to Aircraft Recovery Command-and-Control in
     Attachment 4.
     12.4.3.2. Maintain periodic communication with AMD Logistics. Periodic
     communication will include duty day notification (i.e., start and end of the work period,
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                  49


     meal breaks), an end-of-day repair action recap, and when other issues are encountered at
     the recovery location.
     12.4.3.3. Review the tasking letter to ensure tasked resources and/or actions are being
     complied with as directed by AMD Logistics. Information on the letter usually comes
     from the disabled aircraft’s FCC and home station production supervisor, who informed
     AMD Logistics of specific manpower, supply and/or equipment requirements to ensure a
     successful recovery.
     12.4.3.4. Reference Attachment 6, MRT Team Chief Responsibilities for more specific
     information. Note: These responsibilities expand the MRT Team Chief’s Responsibilities
     identified in AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, Attachment
     8.
  12.4.4. Maintenance Group Organizations will:
     12.4.4.1. Ensure wing MOCs distribute AMD Logistics generated tasking letter to
     appropriate wing agencies and serve as a conduit between AMD Logistics and owning or
     tasked logistics resource functions at home station and at the recovery locations, and
     provide timely aircraft status updates as required. Upon AMD Logistics direction, the
     MOC will also recall base personnel to meet mission recovery requirements.
     12.4.4.2. Ensure qualified personnel by skill-level and certification are assigned to the
     tasked MRT as specified in the tasking letter.
     12.4.4.3. Generate the country clearance request, FP plan and TDY orders for the MRT
     or courier, as applicable, or as tasked by AMD Logistics. Ensure eligible FCC, MRT and
     courier personnel have a current U.S. Passport valid for six (6) months beyond the
     intended date of departure.
         12.4.4.3.1. Ensure the travel orders include the statement: ―MILAIR/commercial
         travel authorized…variations authorized…excess baggage authorized…MEP
         authorized…MRS authorized.‖ This enables the MRT or courier to obtain correct
         travel arrangements from passenger service functions.
         12.4.4.3.2. Mission route support (MRS) permits the bumping of cargo to allow
         space for the MRT and their equipment. Per AMCI 21-108, Logistics Support
         Operations, MEP allows MRT/couriers to bypass passenger terminals processing.
         Aircrews will manifest MEPs on DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest, and include
         anti-hijack protective measures IAW AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting/Aircraft
         Piracy (Hijacking). The MEP tasking authority is AMD Logistics.
     12.4.4.4. Provide support to tasked MRT or courier.
     12.4.4.5. Ensure transient alert flights submit a memo every two-years to the tenant AMS
     (if assigned), which affords the ―quick-release‖ of parts and equipment directly from the
     AMS to identified transient alert personnel (REF: AMCI 24-101, Volume 11, Cargo and
     Mail Policy).
     12.4.4.6. Process resources using one of the following methods as directed by AMD
     Logistics.
50                                                             PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010


         12.4.4.6.1. Aircraft Recovery Movement (ARM). This method moves supplies,
         materials, equipment, or munitions for the recovery of NMC/PMC aircraft. This
         method requires the home station production supervisor to process the resources
         using a DD Form 1149, through the base traffic management office (TMO).
         Resources are loaded in the cargo movement operations system (CMOS) and moved
         via MILAIR, worldwide express (WWX), international heavy weight express (IHX)
         or freight-forwarder.
         12.4.4.6.2. Maintenance-To-Maintenance (MX-2-MX). This method moves supplies,
         materials, equipment, or munitions required to recover NMC/PMC aircraft without
         these resources being processed through the base’s TMO. Instead, they are directly
         transported by unit-assigned aircraft to the disabled aircraft’s location or by unit
         personnel (i.e. maintenance courier or MRT) who hand-carry the resources and travel
         either by MILAIR or commercial aircraft. Maintenance couriers or MRT personnel
         will travel under MEP orders when traveling on MILAIR and process with the
         transporting aircraft’s aircrew at base operations. MX-2-MX will be used only as the
         last resort and in order to meet time-sensitive, short-notice airlift to the disabled
         aircraft’s location. Factors to consider before using MX-2-MX include the disabled
         aircraft’s mission priority, frequency of MILAIR or commercial air to the disabled
         aircraft’s location, and impact to the aircrew transporting the resources. The decision-
         making process must also consider availability of base support functions (i.e. base
         supply and TMO), which may not operate on a 24-hour basis. The owning aircraft
         home station production supervisor will provide a copy of AMD Logistics’ tasking
         letter to the aircrew justifying the MX-2-MX movement of resources. The production
         supervisor will also provide the transporting aircrew with a documented DD Form
         1149 listing all required data, including POC information at the destination base.
     12.4.4.7. When employed, units will establish a supply account with the local chief of
     supply, or utilize an AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization, if no host base support exists
     to requisition supply resources.
  12.4.5. Mission Support Group Organizations:
     12.4.5.1. Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS). Process resources and/or support
     recovery actions as directed by AMD Logistics.
         12.4.5.1.1. Supply-to-Supply. This method laterally moves supplies or munitions
         through established C2 systems for the recovery of NMC/PMC aircraft. This method
         ensures the highest level of ITV since resources are processed through the base’s
         TMO and loaded in their CMOS system for onward movement via MILAIR, WWX
         or freight-forwarder. AMD Logistics determines the source of supply, directs the
         mode of shipment (i.e., MILAIR, WWX, IHX or freight forwarder) and the
         supply/transportation priority (i.e., AMC Very, Very Important Part {VVIP) Project
         Code 196 PACAF HAUL or PACAF 999 MICAP).
         12.4.5.1.2. Base TMO-Outbound Freight and Vehicle Dispatch Flights. TMOs will
         ensure they possess capabilities to ship resources via powertrack when using WWX,
         IHX or freight-forwarder shipping modes. Supplies and equipment will be processed
         as directed by AMD Logistics. Provide U-drive-it vehicle support when required.
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                    51


           12.4.5.1.3. AMD Logistics will coordinate priorities/shipment modes with the
           respective TMO through assistance provided by the 635 SCMG, base supply, the base
           MOC and the owning aircraft home station production supervisor. Under no
           circumstances will TMO ship resources via WWX or IHX without prior approval
           from AMD Logistics. Base TMOs will contact AMD Logistics to resolve shipment
           issues.
   12.4.6. Supply and Transportation Priorities. AMD Logistics will direct the use of the most
   appropriate supply and transportation priority; shipments will be marked and processed
   accordingly. The priorities are:
       12.4.6.1. AMC VVIP Project Code 196 PACER HAUL. AMCI 23-102, Expeditious
       Movement of AMC MICAP/VVIP Assets, authorizes use of Project Code 196 to support
       high-priority USTRANSCOM airlift missions or high-visibility DV missions. Mission
       priorities for airlift are described in Joint Publication 4-01, Appendix A. Mission
       priorities for tanker aircraft are defined in AFI 11-221.
       12.4.6.2. PACAF 999 Mission Impaired Capability--Awaiting Parts (MICAP). Will be
       used support all O&M training and special event missions that do not meet the criteria
       outlined in paragraph 12.4.6.1
   12.4.7. HQ PACAF/A4, 13 AF/A4 and SCMG:
       12.4.7.1. HQ PACAF/A4. Provide assistance as required or requested; normally,
       guidance on policy, command-to-command agreements, interaction with other commands
       and services, general support agreements, exception to policy, maintenance
       communications regarding PACAF-assigned mobility air forces, transfer and
       programmed depot maintenance schedules etc. Advise AMD Logistics of time
       compliance technical orders that impact mission execution. Coordinate instructions and
       policies reviews/rewrites with AMD Logistics that impact mission execution.
       12.4.7.2. 13 AF/A4. Provide AMD assistance as required or requested. Ensure accuracy
       of wing aircraft status reporting and processes. Collaborate with AMD Logistics
       concerning exercise and contingency requirements in relation to reach-back capabilities.
       Establish DOD activity address codes (DODAAC) to support operations.
       12.4.7.3. 635th/735th Supply Chain Management Group. Source and distribute parts as
       directed by AMD Logistics.
12.5. Related Documentation and Support Requirements. Concepts of operations described
above are drawn from and expand guidance published in various Air Force-level doctrine,
instructions, manuals, pamphlets, and technical orders to implement an effective and expeditious
recovery system to support PACAF aircraft worldwide. Managers and supervisors may use other
management principles or procedures not prohibited by this instruction or Air Force-level
instructions to make informed decisions regarding recoveries.
   12.5.1. Wings seeking deviations from this guidance will coordinate with AMD Logistics.
   Conflicts between ANG/AFRC and Air Force administrative publications will be resolved
   IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.
   12.5.2. AMD Logistics performs collateral recovery management of PACAF-assigned and -
   gained air mobility and EAS/OSA aircraft conducting O&M training missions. It is important

  that operations, maintenance and mission support group commanders ensure employed forces
  on protracted off-station O&M training missions are sustained with support equipment,
  supply kits, funding authorizations and properly sized maintenance and logistics readiness
  support teams to support their training requirement.
  12.5.3. Per AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution, and AFI 21-101, AMD
  Logistics is not the primary C2 agency responsible for coordinating reach-back support
  during the employment phase of contingency and JCS-directed or approved exercise
  missions (employments); this responsibility falls on the employed unit and the 13 AF/A4.
  Employments are defined as sustained missions from one location and may not be associated
  with a formal operational or employment order. Resource replenishment is the responsibility
  of the employed force mission commander, DIRMOBFOR, JFACC, or exercise director as
  delineated in the supported OPLAN or OPORD. In the event the supporting infrastructure is
  not in place at the employment location, employed forces should contact the PACAF
  Command Center (PCC) or 13 AF/A4. Upon request, AMD Logistics will provide functional
  support to the PCC or 13 AF/A4.

        INTEGRATED FLIGHT MANAGEMENT PACKAGES/CREW PAPERS

13.1. General Information. The AMD Flight Manager will provide an IFM mission package
consisting of a CFP, NOTAMs, weather brief, DD Form 1801 and 175 (as applicable) and GDSS
Mission Details for all AMD-tasked missions. Contact the AMD Mission Manager at DSN 315-
448-8888, for all mission package coordination.
13.2. Crew Papers, Mission Packages and CFPs. The primary means of delivering these
products to the aircrew is via GDSS. Internet access is available to GDSS account users from a
military site (designated stations within base operations) via the GDSS website. In addition, IFM
mission packages or flight plans may be downloaded with assistance from the command post.
Contact the GDSS Help Desk at Scott AFB (DSN: 312-576-4949) for system or password issues.
13.3. Aircrew Responsibilities. Aircrews must comply with the flight planning provisions for
the appropriate MDS-series instructions, this instruction, and AFI 11-255 (all volumes). Specific
aircrew responsibilities are:
   13.3.1. Mission package/crew papers/CFPs must be checked for flight information
   publication (FLIP) routing compliance, to ensure routing agrees with DIPCLRs, prescribed
   terrain clearance, weather, and any other requirement unique to the mission. Notify the AMD
   Flight Manager of any discrepancies immediately for resolution.
   13.3.2. Prior to departure, aircrews should ensure they have mission packages/crew
   papers/CFPs to get them to the next major PACAF station or the next crew rest location
   capable of mission package/crew papers/CFP reception. Mission legs less than 75-nautical
   miles (NM) will not normally receive CFPs. The AMD Flight Manager will normally file
   flight plans. However, aircraft commanders have the option of filing their own flight plans.
   In any case, aircrews remain responsible for accurate and safe flight plans.
   13.3.3. Aircrew feedback is essential to an effective IFM process. Aircrews are encouraged
   to provide feedback by utilizing the AMD Aircrew Survey form available through the AMD
   website (see paragraph 1.6). Once completed, the critique will be sent to AMD Flight
   Management. The chief of flight management will process each critique, and reply to the
   originating aircrew member as needed.
13.4. Request for Special Requirements and Routings. Standard flight plan performance data
will be used unless specific mission requirements dictate otherwise. Requests for CFP support
for special requirements and/or routings must be requested at least 24-hours prior to departure to
the AMD Flight Manager at DSN 315-448-8877. Requests inside of 24-hours may be
accomplished on a workload-permitting basis.
   13.4.1. Non-AMD tasked air refueling flight plan requests will be coordinated at least 72-
   hours prior to departure with the appropriate AMD Airlift (DSN: 315-448-8855) or AMD
   Tanker Planners (DSN: 315-448-8857). The air refueling request will contain the following
   information, which will be used by the respective planner to develop the flight plan in
   advanced computer flight plan (ACFP) sent via requester’s instructions:
       13.4.1.1. Tanker or receiver.
54                                                                PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010

  for short-notice flight plan requests; however, a shorter notification time may be
  accommodated on a workload-permitting basis.
  13.4.3. The AMD Flight Manager will not provide CFPs for low-level missions, airdrops
  and flights of less than 75-NM.
  13.4.4. Local training air refueling CFPs are supported by their respective units and are not a
  product of AMD.
  13.4.5. Mission Packages/Crew Papers/CFPs.
     13.4.5.1. For large-scale exercise missions, mission packages will be provided as close to
     the planned scenario as possible. Depending on the intricacy and number of flight plans
     requested, and due to CFP processing time, requests must be at least 72-hours in advance.
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                55


  13.4.6. If requested, mission packages can be provided by the AMD Flight Manager for off-
  station training missions. Due to the processing time of these products, requests must be
  coordinated as far in advance as possible, but NLT 24-hours prior to departure. Requests
  within 24-hours of initial departure will only be provided on a workload-permitting basis.
 56                                                            PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010

                              DIPLOMATIC CLEARANCES

14.1. Policy. Actions concerning DIPCLRs and aircraft overflight are delineated below:
   14.1.1. AMD will obtain required DIPCLRs IAW DOD 4500.54G, for all AMD-tasked and
   controlled missions. The responsible AMD section will continuously monitor and update the
   status of requested or modified DIPCLRs in GDSS as information is received. New
   DIPCLRs or modifications to existing clearances will be requested by the responsible AMD
   section when an aircraft is delayed beyond the time limits permitted by the issuing country.
   14.1.2. Aircrews will obtain positive verification from AMD for AMD-tasked missions that
   an overflight clearance was granted prior to flying over any country requiring diplomatic
   overflight clearance. Normally, an aircraft will be allowed to proceed through US, allied, and
   neutral territory, while DIPCLRs are pending for countries to be overflown. Under no
   circumstances will an aircraft be authorized to proceed from one AOR to another AOR or
   theater without positive confirmation that required DIPCLR has been issued for at least the
   first diplomatic stop of the mission. Aircraft commanders must receive the required clearance
   number(s) prior to entry/overflight of a country requiring a DIPCLR.
14.2. Prescribed Forms. This publication does not prescribe any forms.

                          C-130 COMMITMENT GUIDELINES

A2.1. General.
   A2.1.1. A minimum training fence of 3 x C-130 aircraft for the 374AW is instituted.
      A2.1.1.1. The waiver authority for the training fence is PACAF/A3.
      A2.1.1.2. Before requesting a training fence waiver from PACAF/A3, the AMD Chief
      will exhaust all possible courses of action to satisfy the requirement. A waiver will only
      be coordinated to meet must move JCS-prioritized HHQ taskings. A waiver will not be
      processed if the 374 AW accepts the over commit.
   A2.1.2. TWCF tasking level will be determined by the lower of aircrew or aircraft
   availability.
   A2.1.3. The PACAF A/ATS Spreadsheet (Table A2.1) is the vehicle for the 374 AW to
   communicate status of aircraft and aircrew to the AMD, and for the AMD to determine
   resources available for tasking. Both organizations will comply with the instructions
   contained in the spreadsheet.
A2.2. Short-range TWCF/O&M Planning/Scheduling: Weekly and daily flying schedules
will be used to finalize TWCF/O&M missions. Wings will address any TWCF/O&M scheduling
conflicts with AMD immediately after their daily scheduling meeting.
   A2.2.1. If the wing's TWCF and O&M mission scheduling conflicts with the tasking table,
   the AMD Chief has the authority to cancel O&M missions that exceed the established
   baseline fence and task up to the TWCF commit rate only. When a TWCF mission cannot be
   flown as scheduled, the wing will coordinate with AMD. Authority to cancel O&M missions
   in order to execute TWCF missions rests solely with the AMD Chief and only when
   absolutely necessary. The AMD will ensure enough time is allowed from short notice
   requests for TWCF missions so as not to disrupt planned training.
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                      65

A3.1. General
   A3.1.1. A minimum training fence of 2 x C-17 aircraft for the 3 WG and 15 AW is
   instituted.
      A3.1.1.1. The waiver authority for the training fence is PACAF/A3.
      A3.1.1.2. Before requesting a training fence waiver from PACAF/A3, the AMD Chief
      will exhaust all possible courses of action to satisfy the requirement. A waiver will only
      be coordinated to meet must move JCS-prioritized HHQ taskings. A waiver will not be
      processed if the applicable unit accepts the over commit.
   A3.1.2. Tasking levels for TWCF missions will be determined by the unit’s possessed
   aircraft. The 3 WG and 15 AW will each provide four mission capable aircraft per day for
   HHQ-directed missions, unless the number of possessed aircraft (as defined in maintenance
   directives) falls below the eight assigned aircraft. Aircraft allocation will be determined by
   taking 85 percent of the total number of possessed aircraft minus two aircraft, which will be
   used for wing allocated operations and maintenance missions. Table A3.1 describes the C-17
   TWCF/O&M Allocations for PACAF-assigned C-17 Aircraft.
   A3.1.3. AMD Requirements will coordinate changes to C-17 TWCF allocation missions
   with TACC/XOB.

                AIRCRAFT RECOVERY COMMAND-AND-CONTROL

A4.1. Aircraft Recovery C2. Recovery of PACAF-assigned is based solely on the agency (i.e.,
AMD or TACC) that possesses C2 of the mission. Matrix A4.1 details this responsibility.
Matrix A4.1. Aircraft Recovery Command-and-Control




NOTES:
1. O&M Recoveries. Recovery of PACAF-assigned C-17, C-130 and KC-135 aircraft on O&M
missions will normally be supported by the home station (unless AMD Logistics can secure
support through the nearest C-NAF and/or base). AMC may, within their capabilities, provide
maintenance support to PACAF C-17s on O&M missions at AMC en routes or bases; however,
MRTs for PACAF C-17s on O&M missions is ultimately the responsibility of the home station.

2. Funding. Recovery of PACAF-assigned C-130 and KC-135 aircraft executing TWCF
missions will be funded by AMC. Funding for all O&M missions will be provided by the home
station.

3. Recovery of PACAF-assigned C-17 Aircraft under AMD Logistics Control. IAW AMC-
PACAF Command-to-Command Agreement, AMC will provide an MRT to recover a PACAF
C-17 executing a TWCF-funded mission. AMD Logistics will submit an MRT request to the 618
TACC/XOCL that recommends a MRT source; XOCL will source and task the MRT from an
AMC unit. NOTE: AMC will provide only those maintenance specialties within their
capabilities. For example, back shop specialties (e.g., NDI, structural maintenance and fuel cell)
are not available at AMC en routes. As such, AMD Logistics may task the appropriate wing for
back shop specialists and provide a TWCF fund cite authorization memo.

      MAINTENANCE RECOVERY TEAM (MRT) CHIEF RESPONSIBILITIES

A6.1. Designated MRT Chief will:
   A6.1.1. Review the MRT tasking letter and coordinate with appropriate maintenance and
   mission support group supervisors to ensure compliance with tasked actions. Contact 613
   AOC/AMD Logistics if there is a question regarding the maintenance discrepancy, tasked
   resources or any aspect of the recovery plan.
   A6.1.2. Ensure MRT members are being sourced and that temporary duty orders and travel
   requirements have been identified and are being worked.
      A6.1.2.1. Mission route support (MRS) permits the bumping of cargo to allow space for
      the MRT and their equipment. Per AMCI 21-108, Logistics Support Operations, MEP
      allows MRT/couriers to bypass passenger terminals processing. Aircrews will manifest
      MEPs on DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest, and include anti-hijack protective
      measures IAW AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting/Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking). The
      MEP tasking authority is AMD Logistics.
      A6.1.2.2. Advance per diem as required.
      A6.1.2.3. Commercial travel authorization.
      A6.1.2.4. Variations authorized as required.
      A6.1.2.5. Notify AMD Logistics when coordination is complete, or immediately in the
      event of difficulty. Provide the following:
          A6.1.2.5.1. MRT names, rank, name of team chief, Air Force specialty and skill level
          of MRT personnel, and whether MEP authorization is being utilized.
          A6.1.2.5.2. Transportation control numbers for parts and equipment processed for
          shipment.
          A6.1.2.5.3. Coordinate with AMD Logistics to determine the best mode of
          transportation and scheduled itinerary and coordinate transportation requirements
          with TMO. Note: Shipment of large or heavy items by commercial airline mandates
          prior coordination with airline personnel by the MOC or MRT. To maintain control of
          parts and equipment, they must be hand-carried or checked as baggage. If an item is
          not accepted as carry-on luggage or checked as baggage, purchase of an extra seat to
          accommodate it must be considered and is recommended per AFI 21-101.
          Coordination with the airline is the key to movement and avoids unnecessary
          surprises.
   A6.1.3. Ensure team personnel have an updated immunization record, passport valid for six
   (6) months beyond the intended date of departure, approved force protection plan (if
   required), and that the country clearance request (if required) has been submitted and
   approved.
   A6.1.4. Brief the recovery plan to MRT personnel:
      A6.1.4.1. Emphasize safety.
PACAFI10-2101 3 JUNE 2010                                                                      73


         A6.1.4.2. Normal work and rest periods at the recovery site are 12-hours of work
         followed by 12-hours rest. The 12-hour work period may be extended with concurrence
         of AMD Logistics, aircraft commander or home unit Maintenance Group Commander at
         the recovery site. Do not overwork your team and compromise safety. You are
         responsible for their safety.
         A6.1.4.3. Anti-terrorism and force protection
   A6.1.5. Upon arrival at the recovery site, contact the aircraft commander or FCC and assess
   the reported discrepancy. Call AMD Logistics to coordinate work hours and provide a
   telephone number where the team can be contacted, and initial estimated time in commission
   (ETIC). Your initial duty day begins at the time you reported to work prior to MRT tasking.
   Total duty day (home station duty, travel, and recovery site duty) will not exceed 16-hours
   for any team member. MRT work starts immediately upon arrival unless duty day has
   expired en route.
