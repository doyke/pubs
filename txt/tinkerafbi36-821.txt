assigned GS-14 and GS-15 positions and employees are being properly managed and developed.
2. Senior Leader Development Panel.

   a forum for senior leadership to review GS-14 and GS-15 career progression, manage
   positions, and track career broadening assignments. SLDP establishes a centralized forum
