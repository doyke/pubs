appropriate. This operation applies to all Airmen assigned to the 914 AW returning from an
active duty deployment. It ensures that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in
this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcssa61a/afrims/afrims/.         Refer any recommended changes and
questions about this operation to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR), 914 FSS/CC using

2. Definitions.
   2.1. In-processing – Upon return from a deployment all members must be properly
   accounted for. In-processing is the completion of all required medical evaluations, line of
   duty determinations, recertification of pay and final travel voucher turn-in, award and
   decorations updates, DD Form 214 application, reenlistment if necessary and in the case of
   hard-ships, retention on active duty.
   2.2. Special Pass – Approval may be delegated to a level no lower than squadron section
   commander, deputies, or equivalents. Refer to AFI 36-3003 for restrictions. Commanders
   may further restrict leave and passes as necessary to meet mission requirements.
   2.3. Downtime – Once re-deployed to home station/deactivation location, Air Reserve
   Command Airmen may be accorded downtime. While the purpose of downtime is allow
   Airmen to become reacquainted with their families, there are legal issues such as Line of
   Duty, medical treatment and duty status that necessarily restrict the boundaries of this
   program for some members. Downtime has been incorrectly characterized as ―free gratis‖ or
   non-chargeable leave time away from duty. However, it is not a category of leave
   recognized in statute. While it is true members must be present for duty, on leave, on
   temporary duty (TDY), on a ―special pass‖, or AWOL; it is permissible to allow members
   otherwise present for duty time to take care of family and personal matters after a
   deployment. However, if they are not present for duty, they must be on leave or ―special
   pass.‖ They may also be required to perform other duties as assigned by the unit
   commander. Post deployment downtime is a commander’s program designed to help
   maintain quality of life and retain valued Air Force members to keep our military strong and
   ready.
       2.3.1. Downtime applies to all deployed personnel in support of a contingency
       Continental United States and Outside of the Continental United States (CONUS and
       OCONUS). Members must have been deployed away from their home station. NOTE:
       Downtime does not apply to TDYs (Unit Tasking).
4                                                              914AWI36-403 4 APRIL 2012


       2.3.2. Personnel are eligible for downtime once they in-process at their home station
       after a deployment. Members who are ordered to active duty voluntarily or involuntarily
       under Title 10 USC 12301(d) or 12302, and are deployed away from home station in
       support of a named contingency or Air & Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) are eligible
       for downtime.
       2.3.3. Downtime is to be completed prior to the member’s final out-processing for
       release from active duty.
       2.3.4. For the purpose of downtime, all downtime will begin and end in the local area.
       All downtime will be taken within the established commuting area of 50 miles or one (1)
       hour. Downtime will be taken at the member’s home station upon their return from
       deployment, not at an interim duty location. Personnel whose official residence is
       outside the commuting area are prohibited from taking downtime at their residence. For
       these personnel, downtime must be taken within the local commuting area only.
       Personnel who reside outside the local commuting area must be in an official leave or
       ―special pass‖ status to travel to their residence.
           2.3.4.1. Members who conduct downtime outside this specified area must take
           chargeable leave. All rules for chargeable leave apply.
       2.3.5. Air Mobility Command (AMC) gained personnel who serve on active duty,
       voluntarily or involuntarily under Title 10 USC 12301(d) or 12302, and are deployed
       away from home station in support of a named contingency or AEF deployment will be
       afforded:
           2.3.5.1. 42 - 89 day deployment = 7 days Downtime maximum
           2.3.5.2. 90 days and over = 14 days Downtime maximum
    2.4. Post Deployment Mobilization Respite Absence (PDMRA) – Paid military time that
    applies to involuntarily mobilized members only. It is normally viewed as ―free gratis‖ time
    away from duty (non-chargeable leave). All PDMRA must be used after terminal leave and
    prior to the member returning to employment.
