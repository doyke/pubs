SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been revised in its entirety and must be completely reviewed. Major
changes include the following: the name change of the awards program to General John P.
Jumper Award for Excellence in Warfighting Integration and the Annual Information
Dominance Awards Program. There is an increase in the number of award categories to
recognize each new enlisted Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). Changes were made to the
number of personnel a unit must have to quality for the large unit and small unit award. The
award period changed from calendar year awards to fiscal year awards. The Air Force Annual
Modeling and Simulation Awards Program was deleted from this instruction because the
authority was transferred to SAF/A3/5.

   are activities directly linked to the integration of Air Force warfighting and (or) operations
   support capabilities. Participation in fundraising activities, unit and private non-profit
   organizations such as booster clubs, Top 4, Air Force Association, and the like do not qualify
   as additional duties or activities linked to warfighting integration mission accomplishments.
   Do not address the nominee’s education and degrees; attendance at courses, seminars, etc.; or
   community and cultural activities performed by the nominee.
   1.7.8. Avoid the use of broad or vague terminology in the nominations and do not
   summarize the nominee’s job description.

1.9. Selection Panels, Process, and Board Rules of Engagement.
     1.9.1. A3CF/A6CF shall administer the Air Force selection board electronically by way of a
     Community of Practice (CoP) or SharePoint site. This site shall provide for each panel
     member to view, evaluate, and score nominees on-line.
     1.9.2. A3CF/A6CF shall establish separate panels for each of the award categories. Panel
     membership shall be functional in nature and United States Air Force (USAF) military
     members and federal civilian employees assigned to units at any level of command may
     serve as members. Individuals who accept a position on the panels will be swearing to and
     expected to abide by the following oath: “I will, without prejudice or partiality, having in
     view the special fitness of the officers, airmen, or civilians, and the efficiency and
     effectiveness of the USAF, perform the duties imposed upon me.” They must also be
     available to devote the time required to evaluate and score the nomination packages within
     the time frame allowed.
     1.9.3. Each panel shall consist of at least three but no more than five members who will
     evaluate and score the nomination packages. Panel members will be senior in rank to the
     nominees they are judging and work independent of each other during the selection process.
     Members selected to participate on the board shall serve as a primary or alternate board
     member for a period not to exceed 1 year. However, members who are in any nominees’
     supervisory chain of command or in positions that could put them in a compromising
     position or cause a conflict of interest will identify and remove themselves from the panel.
AFI36-2845 29 AUGUST 2013                                                                        9


   1.9.4. The senior-ranking member on the panel shall take the role of president. The role of
   the Panel President is to collect scores from each individual board member, tabulate the final
   scores, arbitrate and reconcile any ties, certify the outcome of their respective board, and
   identify the winner back to A3CF/A6CF. Panel presidents will not score the nominations
   unless a requirement exists for the president to break a tie for first place.
   1.9.5. The board rules of engagement shall provide no room for discussions about the
   nominations or scoring decisions, in whole or part, between panel members or with anyone
   else inside or outside of the selection process. Panel members will not attempt to coerce or
   influence any other members on the panels to formulate scores or select a particular
   individual during the selection processes. Exception to the “no discussion” rule may take
   place only if and when significant differences occur between panel members’ scores or ties
   occurred and the members must communicate to resolve the differences. The panel president
   will first adjudicate the need for any discussions and rescoring actions in the event of major
   splits between panel members’ scores. Rescoring may take place, but only when it's clearly
   evident that it will change the outcome (winner) of the competition—it must be in the best
   interest of and fair to all nominees concerned. The final decision for panel members to
   discuss or rescore any nominees package will rest with the panel president.
   1.9.6. Panel members cannot disclose the outcome of the competitions to anyone prior to
   approval and formal announcement of the winners. Panel members will not disclose or share
   with others how their command nominees ranked against other unit nominees in the scoring
   process; nor will they discuss their perception of creative and (or) noncreative writing used in
   the nominations. To do so would be a “personal” opinion; no one member of the panel can
   speak for any other members on the panel. Panel members are required to destroy all
   documentation relating to the board after SAF/CIO A6 has approved the results and formally
   announced the winners.
1.10. Presenting Awards. SAF/CIO A6 will announce award recipients by message and
distribute or present the awards as appropriate.
1.11. Photographs. If requested, each individual award winner should provide one, portrait-
style, in Service Dress (head and shoulders, with the US flag in the background) 8” x 10” color
photograph by way of digital photo files to SAF/CIO A6 Awards Workflow e-mail box.

           performing duties that are consistent with their assigned AFSC and defined in the
           award category nominated for which they are nominated; civilian employees must be
           performing duties that are consistent with those described in the military information
           dominance career fields. Nominated individuals must have performed in the duty
           AFSC or civilian occupational code that corresponds with the grade held for the
           majority of the award period unless otherwise stated.
AFI36-2845 29 AUGUST 2013                                                                   11


        2.4.1.1.2. Enlisted award categories are subdivided into three rank tiers: Airman
        (Airman Basic through Senior Airman, inclusive of those selected for promotion to
        Staff Sergeant), NCO (Staff Sergeants and Technical Sergeants, inclusive of those
        selected for promotion to Master Sergeant), and SNCO (Master Sergeants and Senior
        Master Sergeants not selected for promotion to Chief Master Sergeant).
        2.4.1.1.3. Individuals promoted during the awards period may only compete in the
        grade they held for the majority of the period, normally 183 days or more.
        2.4.1.1.4. Eligibility for the Air Force information assurance element, team, and unit
        awards is the same as that defined in each of those award categories.
  2.4.2. Award Categories.
     2.4.2.1. Air Force Officer, Enlisted, and Civilian Individual Awards. These awards
     recognize officers, enlisted, and federal civilian employees working in information
     dominance and/or cyberspace career fields for sustained superior performance and
     contributions that benefited the Air Force and (or) DoD missions and operations. This
     section of the program provides for only one winner in each of the individual award
     categories. Nominating authorities defined in paragraph 2.6 may nominate one
     individual in each of the designated award categories. Individuals competing for these
     awards are not eligible to compete for the awards defined in other tables in this guidance
     where the AFSC and (or) subspecialty work performed would be the same as those
     recognized by these awards. This does not preclude nominees from being a member of a
     nominated team; nor does it restrict them from competing for other awards addressed in
     AFI 36-2845, providing the qualifying factors and basis used for other awards differ from
     those required for the information dominance officer, enlisted, and civilian individual
     awards. Junior enlisted members (E-1 through E-5) selected as Information Dominance
     Award winners will go on to compete for the Air Force Communicator and Air Traffic
     Controller Association’s Communicator of the Year Award (see paragraph 4.2 for more
     information regarding this award).

        2.4.2.2. Air Force Information Assurance (IA) Awards. These awards recognize an
        individual and an IA element for sustained superior performance and professional
        excellence while performing and managing IA programs and whose contributions most
        improved the security of information systems at the base, MAJCOM, HQ USAF, or
        national-level, or the security of United States government information. These awards
        provide for only one winner in each category and nominating authorities defined in
        paragraph 2.6 may nominate one individual and one element. Individuals competing for
        the individual IA award are not eligible to compete for the awards defined in other tables
        in this guidance where the AFSC and (or) subspecialty work performed would be the
        same as those recognized by this award. Commanders who nominate a part of a unit for
        the element award may incorporate the element into a combined nomination to qualify
        the unit for a unit award. They cannot, however, use the same accomplishments as those
        already used by the element as the sole basis of the nomination. An element is a part of a
        unit; it may be a flight, division, branch, section, or office. Contracted individuals and
        contracted IA elements are not eligible for the IA awards. The individual and the
        element selected as winners of these awards will go on to compete for the National
        Security Agency’s Information Assurance, Frank B. Rowlett trophies (see paragraph 4.3
        for more information regarding this award).

        2.4.2.3. Air Force Information Dominance Team Award. Named in honor of former
        comptroller of the Air Force and commander of the Air Force Logistics Command,
        General Edwin W. Rawlings, this award recognizes a group of Air Force information
        dominance personnel brought together to work as a team (e.g., tiger team) for
        accomplishments associated with a one-time, nonrecurring special project, process
        improvement, or short-term endeavor that resulted in tangible or intangible benefits to the
  16                                                             AFI36-2845 29 AUGUST 2013


        Air Force and produced goal-oriented results that, when put in place, would significantly
        improve information dominance/cyberspace to Air Force and (or) DoD missions and
        operations. The endeavor cannot be part of the teams daily operational work; rather, it is
        a one-time special endeavor that has a start date and a closing date and the need to repeat
        the endeavor or mission is not likely to occur again. Contracted personnel or companies
        selected or hired to perform a special (contracted) project or participate on a team are
        not eligible. This section of the program provides for only one winner and nominating
        authorities defined in paragraph 2.6 may nominate one team.

                    endeavor should not have started prior to the beginning of the award period of
                    service and the team must have completed the effort by the end of the award
                    period of service.
        2.4.2.4. Air Force Information Dominance Unit Awards. There are two unit award
        categories. One honors Major General Harold M. McClelland, a distinguished Air Force
        communications officer and airpower pioneer; the other honors Lieutenant General
        Harold W. Grant, the Director of Air Force Telecommunications (1958-1961) and the
        first commander of the Air Force Communications Service. These awards recognize
        large and small information dominance/cyberspace units for sustained superior
        performance and professional excellence while managing core information dominance
        and/or cyberspace functions, and for contributions that most improved Air Force and (or)
        DoD operations and missions. These awards provide for only one winner in each unit
        award category and nominating authorities defined in paragraph 2.6 may nominate one
        unit in each unit award category.
           2.4.2.4.1. Groups are allowed to compete. Nominated units may compete for only
           one unit award. Air Force-, Major Command-, and Numbered Air Force-level
           headquarters Information Dominance support staff directorates, divisions, branch
           offices, sections, and flights are not eligible for an Air Force information
           dominance/cyberspace unit award. Directorates, divisions, flights, and the like form
           an internal staff structure of a whole organization and are not units for the purpose of
           these unit awards. Contracted units are not eligible for an Air Force information
           dominance/cyberspace unit award.
           2.4.2.4.2. The Air Force Information Dominance Unit Awards (Grant and
           McClelland) are SAF/CIO A6 functional community awards specifically for Air
           Force groups and squadrons. Joint units may not compete for these awards.
           2.4.2.4.3. The Air Force Information Dominance Unit Awards are reserved for units
           that specifically perform a cyberspace or information dominance mission as their
           primary function. Unless a unit can demonstrate that cyberspace is its primary
           operational domain, they don't meet the threshold for submission for these awards.

 2.5. Award Period of Service and Nomination Packages.
    2.5.1. Award Period of Service. The award period is based on a fiscal year calendar, 1
    October – 30 September.
    2.5.2. Nomination Packages. Nominating Authorities listed in paragraph 2.6 may submit
    one nominee per award category listed in Tables 2.1 - 2.5. If electing to submit a
    nomination, packages must adhere to the following guidelines:
18                                                             AFI36-2845 29 AUGUST 2013


     2.5.2.1. Nomination packages consist of the latest version of AF Form 1206, Nomination
     for Award. Structure the format of the AF Form 1206 the same as that outlined in
     Attachments 3 through 5, Figures A3.1, A4.1, and A5.1. Nomination will not exceed 30
     lines (excluding headers); explain acronyms in alphabetical order on reverse side of AF
     Form 1206 or include within narrative. For team award nominations, provide the name,
     rank or grade, and unit assignment of each team member on the reverse page of the AF
     Form 1206. For each unit award, provide the number of Air Force manpower (military
     and federal civilian) funded positions authorized to the unit in the first bulleted statement
     on the AF Form 1206-exclude contract positions. All nominations must be submitted
     individually as pdf files. Nominations documenting a deployed member’s achievements,
     to include those on a 365-day TDY deployment, must compete through the deployed
     member’s home-station unit and owning command. Nominations not meeting the above
     criteria will be disqualified.
     2.5.2.2. Nominations should be accurate, succinct, and describe how the individual’s,
     team’s, or unit’s superior performance and contributions impacted cyberspace services
     and support to Air Force and (or) DoD missions and operations.
     2.5.2.3. A nomination should paint a clear, descriptive picture of the nominee’s
     accomplishments; it should tell the story. Use one line, accomplishment-result-impact
     bulleted statements when possible. Use concise, well-written statements of
     accomplishments and their impact on the unit, wing, command, Air Force, or DoD
     objectives, operations, or missions. Arrange the facts in a neat, organized manner.
     Avoid the use of broad or vague terminology. Do not write it like a job description; panel
     members should not have to search through a generic laundry list of duties to hunt for
     what the nominees achieved. The first statement should set the tone of the nomination-
     an overall assessment of the nominee’s performance, potential, and qualities. The
     remaining statements should provide an easy to read overview of the nominee’s
     accomplishments-start with the most important accomplishment; finish with the least
     important. Write the nomination in a way that will direct the panel members’ attention to
     the importance of the nominee’s efforts and not to the importance of what the systems
     can produce. Do not put classified information in the nomination packages.
     2.5.2.4. Do not include the last four numbers of the SSN on the AF Form 1206. Leave
     the SSN block blank.
     2.5.2.5. Quantify statistics by using numbers and give comparative figures such as
     “…reduced down time from 6 hours to 3 hours.” Avoid the use of percentages and do
     not use terminology such as “multiple,” “staff doubled,” etc.
     2.5.2.6. Nominations for individuals reassigned to a different unit during the award
     period of service may address efforts performed in both units.
     2.5.2.7. If the nominee deployed during the award period of service, do not base the
     nomination solely on the nominee’s deployed activities unless the member was deployed
     for the entire award period of service; address what the nominee accomplished while at
     his or her home unit as well.
     2.5.2.8. The officer, enlisted, and civilian information dominance award nominations
     should focus on how the individual’s performance exceeded expectations and how the
AFI36-2845 29 AUGUST 2013                                                                   19


     individual succeeded in maintaining and (or) improving Air Force information
     dominance standards or capabilities and the measurable, observable results the nominee
     achieved. Define how the nominee directly contributed to operational capabilities and
     enhanced mission support to the warfighter, unit, wing, command, or Air Force, linking
     relevant accomplishments with identifiable and quantifiable mission impacts. Highlight
     the nominee’s leadership and management experiences that set the nominee apart from
     others of equal or higher rank or grade. Outline how the nominee used these skills to
     overcome organizational challenges, identifying any process changes that enabled and
     (or) enhanced mission capability, while saving resources for use elsewhere.
        2.5.2.8.1. The nominations may address additional duties in the basis of the
        nomination provided they are activities directly linked to information
        dominance/cyberspace support to the warfighter, unit, base, command, Air Force,
        etc., and mission accomplishment.
        2.5.2.8.2. Using personal development in nominations is permissible provided the
        academic activities are directly linked to the information dominance/cyberspace
        support to the warfighter, unit, base, command, Air Force, etc., and mission
        accomplishment. For example: a member is pursuing a Bachelor of Science Degree
        in Information Technology and used academic theory or philosophy to develop a
        relational database. Discussions about additional training and certification are also
        permissible, provided the training is directly aligned with nominee’s job and
        leadership enhancement and linked to functional mission accomplishments.
        2.5.2.8.3. The use of base and (or) community involvement in nominations is also
        permissible provided the activities are directly linked to information
        dominance/cyberspace support to the warfighter, unit, base, command, Air Force,
        etc., and mission accomplishment. For example: a member who devoted 20 hours of
        off-duty time to prepare for the local Air Force Communications-Electronics
        Association (AFCEA) chapter vendor demonstration that resulted in a positive event
        for 800 base attendees to view emerging technology; a member who coordinated with
        a local Professional Military Education and Training office to insert curriculum on
        increasing cyberspace security through sound personal practices; or a member who
        arranged a non-duty hour tour of the base radar maintenance facility for the local Boy
        Scouts—a positive recruiting event for those considering Air Force careers.
        2.5.2.8.4. Do NOT discuss participation in fundraising activities for unit and private
        non-profit organizations such as booster clubs, Top 4, Air Force Association,
        AFCEA, and the like in any individual, team, or unit nominations. Fundraising
        activities do NOT qualify as additional duties or services linked to mission
        accomplishments; they earn zero credit for scoring purposes.
     2.5.2.9. The IA program manager and element award nominations should focus only on
     how the nominees excelled in the practice of IA during the award period of service.
     These nominations should provide evidence of the nominee’s ability to identify and solve
     significant IA problems, threats, or vulnerabilities. The nominations should demonstrate
     the nominee’s outstanding leadership and knowledge in the application of IA.
     Additionally, the award should outline any development of innovative programs for IA
     training, education, or awareness. It should also describe any innovative and creative use
 20                                                            AFI36-2845 29 AUGUST 2013


      of resources (personnel, funds, or facilities) to successfully accomplish IA-related goals
      and missions—at the organizational or national level. Finally, the nomination should
      highlight the nominee’s significant contributions to the improvement of information
      systems security at the unit, wing, command, Air Force, or national level.
      2.5.2.10. The team award nomination should focus only on one special project, process
      improvement, or short-term endeavor; a special task that does not occur in a continuing
      assignment or mission. The nomination should give a concise picture of the chartered
      project and the team’s efforts to produce goal-oriented results that, when put in place,
      improved the efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of Air Force information dominance
      and chief information officer programs, operations, missions, and support to the
      warfighter. See Attachment 4, Figure A4.1.
      2.5.2.11. The unit award nomination should focus on successes associated with
      maintaining and (or) improving information technology standards or capabilities.
      Describe how the unit’s key processes and services impacted customers and Air Force or
      DoD objectives, operations, and missions. See Attachment 5, Figure A5.1.
      2.5.2.12. The postal unit award nomination should focus on successes associated with
      maintaining and (or) improving postal service standards or capabilities. Describe how
      the unit’s key processes and services impacted customers and Air Force or DoD
      objectives, operations, and missions.
2.6. Nomination Due Date and Nominating Authorities. Nomination packages from lower
level units should channel through respective command competitive echelons. Packages from
nominating authorities must reach SAF/CIO A6 Awards workflow e-mail box electronically no
later than 14 November of the current year.

 AIR FORCE INFORMATION DOMINANCE AND CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER
                  SPECIAL RECOGNITION PROGRAM

3.1. This program provides special recognition to individuals who made significant
contributions to an Air Force special project, tiger team, and the like. This is not an annual
competitive recognition program, but rather serves as an incentive to encourage continued high
performance at all levels of command. The intent is to reward military members and federal
civilian employees at installations, intermediate headquarters, FOAs, DRUs, MAJCOMs, and
HQ USAF staff activities for specific achievements associated with the completion of a short-
term endeavor or land-marked event that benefits Air Force Information Dominance and Chief
Information Officer programs, operations, and/or missions. SAF/CIO A6 may award a small
memento, such as a coin, keychain, cup, or any other small item of minimal value, bearing the
SAF/CIO A6 organizational seal, in a fashion that is similar to that used for awarding
commanders’ coins or by any other appropriate method.
3.2. Eligibility.
   3.2.1. USAF military members and federal civilian employees, regardless of their career
   fields and organizational assignments, who perform a special act, process improvement,
   short-term endeavor, or land-marked event, or participate as members on small (10 people or
   less) Air Force tiger teams to complete a specific project are eligible for this recognition.
   Contracted personnel and companies selected or hired to perform a special (contracted)
   project or participate on a team are not eligible. However, SAF/CIO A6 may extend
   appreciation to these individuals should their contributions and efforts extend far beyond
   those specified or implied in the terms of the contract, according to AFI 36-1004, Managing
   the Civilian Recognition Program. Any letters of appreciation shall flow from SAF/CIO A6
   through the respective contracting officer to the contracted employee’s company.
   3.2.2. The need for the special act, short-term endeavor, or milestone event may have
   derived from an Air Force- or command-level task and have produced goal-oriented results
   that, when put in place, would improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of Air
   Force warfighting integration and chief information officer programs, operations, missions,
   and support to the war fighter.
       3.2.2.1. A special act or achievement means an accomplishment associated with a one-
       time, nonrecurring special project, process improvement, or other short-term endeavor,
       which is in addition to the military member’s or civilian employee’s normal job
       requirements and warrants SAF/CIO A6 recognition.
       3.2.2.2. A milestone event means special accomplishments associated with the
       completion of a test effort or multi-year project that occurs in a continuing assignment
       and warrants SAF/CIO A6 recognition.
   3.2.3. Those recommended for this special recognition are eligible to compete for the annual
   awards addressed in this publication and commanders may use the same special act and
   accomplishments as part of the basis for annual awards.
AFI36-2845 29 AUGUST 2013                                                                    23


3.3. Period of Service. The period of service is dependent on the time frame associated with
the short-term achievement, process improvement, or land-marked event.
3.4. Documentation Requirements. Managers or team leaders at any level command who
have first-hand knowledge of the individual’s or team members’ combined performance while
assigned to perform the Air Force- or command-level task may send an E-mail through
command channels to SAF/CIO A6 Workflow within 3 months of completion of the project or
event. Documentation should provide the individual’s or team member’s name, organization,
period of service, and briefly describe the purpose, accomplishments, and goal-oriented results.
