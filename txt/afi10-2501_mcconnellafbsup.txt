notice additions, and/or change names to scheduled classes within ACES (swapping students)
and cancellations can be made up to 24 hours prior to class start. Cancellations received within
24 hrs of class start time, unless due to emergency circumstances, will result in a no-show. Upon
class completion, 22 CES/CEX will identify students as either ―in attendance‖ or ―no-show‖
within the ACES Unit Schedulers module. Unit schedulers can determine unit members that
AFI10-2501_MCCONNELLAFBSUP 25 MAY 2011                                                            7

Defense Awareness Course, Explosive Ordnance Reconnaissance (EOR), and AF Counter-
Improvised Explosive Device Course (C-IED).
6.6.1.3.8. (Added) Students will arrive to CBRN Skills Survival Training (SST) class prior to
class start time with training CBRN IPE consisting of a serviceable chemical protective mask
and AFPAM 10-100.
6.6.1.3.9. (Added) Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring assigned personnel attend
scheduled training. Students will be turned away from class and re-directed to their unit
scheduler for the following reasons: Students arriving late, medically profiled specifically
prohibiting his/her participation to a particular class or to any particular component of the course
instruction (i.e. can’t wear IPE), has just completed a full-duty work shift, not having course
specific CBT completed, wearing any combination of an Air Force blue uniform, and/or showing
up for a class who are not scheduled, etc. Units will be notified of all personnel released from
training for any of the above reasons.
6.6.1.3.10. (Added) Cancellations received within 24 hrs of class start time, unless due to
emergency circumstances, will result in a no-show. Slot change requests affecting utilization
(i.e. cancellations) will only be accepted from the unit scheduler, first sergeant, or commander.
All correspondence regarding scheduling, rescheduling, cancellations and swapping of slots must
go through the appointed unit scheduler or alternate. EM Training will not deal directly with
students for the issues listed above. 22 CES/CEX, Training Section Non-Commissioned Officer
In Charge will provide unit commanders, through the 22 CES/CC, monthly attendance statistics
and quota utilization.

ensure all unit personnel receive current EM information. Unit personnel with dependents are
responsible for briefing their dependents on local conditions.
7.7.3. (Added) Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) members must perform EET duties in at least
one wing-level exercise annually not to exceed 15 months. This satisfies refresher requirements
identified in AFI 10-2501. EET personnel who have not participated in an exercise must attend

A8.1. General.
   A8.1.1. The EOC is activated and recalled at the discretion of the 22 ARW/CC.
   A8.1.2. The EOC updates the Crisis Action Team (CAT) with ongoing incident status and
   seeks support through the CAT when on-scene requirements surpass the installation’s
   inherent capability and the installation’s cumulative capabilities acquired through mutual aid
   agreements.
   A8.1.3. The EOC may also support joint information activities. The scope of responsibilities
   include: coordination, communications (including exchanging data with the UCCs, resource
   dispatching and tracking, information collection, and analysis and dissemination).
   A8.1.4. The EOC Director, in conjunction with 22 CES/CEX, is the primary custodian for
   any modifications/alterations to the infrastructure of the primary and alternate EOC.

     likely to be needed during the emergency response and recovery phases.
         A8.3.3.1. The EOC Director has the authority to activate all, some, or none of the ESFs
         depending upon the scope and magnitude of the incident and needs of the IC. Once
         activated, the ESFs operate under the authority of the EOC Director.
         A8.3.3.2. During wartime operations, the EOC structure may be tailored to meet the
         unique and specific contingency requirements outside the scope of a traditional EOC.
         The main body of the EOC will inherently be unchanged; the structure will be modified
         to meet the mission continuation/restoration needs of the commander by adding or
         removing personnel (adding the Mission Director and Minimum Operating Strip Plotter,
         removing AFOSI, etc).
