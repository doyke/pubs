This manual implements Air Force Policy Directives 36-26, Military Force Management, 36-5, Civilian Personnel
Resource Management. This manual provides guidance and procedures for functional users at all levels to operate
Personnel Concept III (PC-III). This volume applies to all civilian personnel flights (CPFs), Active, Air Force
Reserve (AFRes), and Air National Guard (ANG); it also pertains to unit personnel offices, work centers,
supervisors, and commanders with a need to access the personnel data system. PC-III is a military system which
was modified to accommodate civilian personnel actions. Both military and civilians organizations have access to
this portion of the PDS. Submit requests for change and technical assistance to HQ AFPC/DPD, 550 C Street
West, Suite 16, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4718. Submit proposed changes involving AFRes through HQ
USAF/REPP. Proposed supplements that affect any personnel function performed at major command (MAJCOM)
level or below are processed as prescribed in Air Force Instruction 37-160, The Air Force Publications and Forms
Management Programs-Developing and Processing Publications, table 2. HQ AFPC/DPDXA must approve all
supplements.

This volume does not supplement or supersede personnel management policies and procedures established and
directed by other Air Force publications. Throughout this volume, particularly in the decision logic tables (DLTs),
a necessary relationship is established with directives written by functional offices. When a conflict exists between
this volume and the prescribing or policy directive, the prescribing or policy directive takes precedence over this
publication.

This volume is affected by the Privacy Act of 1974. It gives the procedures for maintaining and collecting
information in Personnel Data System (PDS). The authority to collect and maintain the data in this system of
record is Title 10 U.S.C., Section 8013. This volume does not prescribe any forms that require a Privacy Act
Statement. System of Records Notice F030 AF MP A, A Personnel Data System (PDS), applies.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This volume is reformatted to conform with new Air Force policy.

                                                       GENERAL INFORMATION

Section A--Purpose and Scope

1.1. Purpose. This manual has been prepared primarily as a source of information and procedures for PC-III
users in the civilian personnel community assigned to various levels: CPFs, work centers, orderly rooms,
commanders, managers, and supervisors at all levels. Some users will have more opportunities to become familiar
with PC-III than will others. Therefore, a major objective is to develop the style and content of this manual for the
benefit of those who may have a limited understanding of both the personnel system and PC-III. Even though this
manual pertains to civilians personnel data system, the military will also have access to PDS.

1.2. Scope of This Chapter. This chapter contains information on Privacy Act and security, as well as PC-III
system management responsibilities; it applies equally to CPF, MPF, and CRPO PSMs unless otherwise stated.
The term "PSM" applies equally to civilian, RegAF, ANG, and AFRes system managers. Not all inclusive, this
chapter is designed to help PSMs operate and manage PC-III equipment, processes, and administration.

Section B--Privacy Act and Security

1.3. General. The Privacy Act of 1974 requires protection of records containing personal data to prevent possible
invasion of privacy and release of information to unauthorized persons. In particular, this act requires that all
agencies establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and
confidentiality of personal information and records. It is designed to protect records against any anticipated threats
or hazards to their security or integrity that could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or
unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained. Data security involves protection against
accidental or intentional disclosure, modification, or destruction.

1.4. Responsibilities. The major provisions of the Privacy Act that most directly involve the PC-III system or
network limit the disclosure of personal information to authorized persons and agencies. These controls include
methods for providing positive identification of authorized system users, authenticating their right to have access to
specific data, and preventing them from gaining access to data and programs to which they are not entitled.
AFMAN 36-2622         Volume 5      1 March 1997                                                                           9

1.4.1. PC-III remote terminals are available for commanders, managers, orderly room personnel, staff agencies,
and individuals. Commanders can run inquiries and generate reports on any or all of their assigned personnel.
Their designated representatives can update specified data items in personnel records. Individuals have inquiry
and update capability against their own records to accomplish certain functions.

1.4.2. The PC-III network greatly increases the number of personnel system terminals. Because the terminal is the
primary device for accessing personnel data, the chances for unauthorized access to personal information are also
increased.

1.4.3. Commanders at all levels with access to personnel records through PC-III must take reasonable precautions
to ensure that proper safeguards are established.

1.5. Computer Security Safeguards:

1.5.1. Physical Security. The first approach to protecting access to terminals and systems is physical security.
Wherever possible, the equipment should be in a limited access area. A simple way to prevent such access is to
physically lock the terminal location when it is not in use. As a minimum, the area must be secured at the end of
each workday. During shorter non-use periods, other physical security measures can be used.

1.5.2. Appointments. Each agency (unit, CPF, MPF, staff agency, etc.) is required to appoint a primary and
alternate computer system security officer (CSSO) and a primary and alternate terminal area security officer
(TASO) and notify the gateway system administrator (GSA) in writing. (See figures 1.1 and 1.2 for sample
appointment letters.) Submit changes to these responsibilities, in writing, to the GSA no later than 30 days prior to
the effective dates.

1.5.3. User Verification. Users are held accountable for their actions by positive identification. This is done by
writing each processed application to a log file and attaching the specific user’s login to that application.
Passwords also establish positive identification:

1.5.3.1. Login. Each user is assigned a login, which is a matter of general knowledge since it is displayed on the
terminal and various output media as a means of product distribution.

1.5.3.2. Password. Password management is vital to the physical security of PC-III. A password is a string of
characters that positively identifies an authorized user. It is restricted in that it is assigned by the computer and is
known only to the authorized user who has the corresponding login.

1.5.4. Access Requirements:

1.5.4.1. The base automated information system security manager controls access to the BLPS.

1.5.4.2. The GSA controls access to the PC-III network and issues logins for each authorized system user.
Individual logins and passwords are required to gain access to PC-III applications. Knowledge of a password
associated with a login is considered proof of authority to use the capabilities associated with that login. The
primary element of PC-III access control is the secrecy of each authorized user’s password.

1.5.4.3. The GSA can issue new passwords in situations where passwords have been forgotten or compromised.
This allows authorized users to gain access to PC-III and have the computer issue new passwords. The GSA must
have positive user identification (ID card, personal recognition, etc.) before making changes.

1.5.4.4. Controls and Policy. Activities using PC-III must strictly control the assignment and use of logins and
passwords. They must limit system access to valid users by designating them to the GSA in writing. Requests
must indicate specific system (for example, orderly room, commander, CPF customer service, wing staff etc.) and
function and data element requirements. Persons who separate, resign, etc., must be removed from access (See
figure 1.3 for PC-III Access/Deletion Request). Individual users must acknowledge receipt of their
logins/passwords. The GSA must retain these acknowledgments until they are no longer required (for example,
PCS, retirement, separation, etc.). See figure 1.4 for a sample login designation letter.
10                                                                  AFMAN 36-2622 Volume 5 1 March 1997

1.5.4.4.1. Password Management. Users are responsible for safeguarding their passwords from unauthorized
disclosure or use. Every 3 months, upon initial entry (login) into the system, each user will be informed of
password expiration. The computer will generate four random passwords, of which the user must choose one.
When the new password is entered, the user will be prompted to reenter it for confirmation. Notify the GSA
immediately to expire a password if there is any reason to believe it has been compromised.

1.5.4.4.2. Audit Trails. The PC-III audit trail is an internal system tracking mechanism that records detailed
information, such as the name of a person who logged on, the date or time of logon, and the date or time of logoff.
An accurate log of all transactions involving information flow is accumulated and monitored so that if a problem
arises, an accurate account of all events leading up to the problem may be traced.

1.5.4.4.3. Implementation. An effective security program necessitates assigning responsibilities for administering
it, establishing controls, and initiating the necessary procedures for operating it. Security concerns are an integral
part of the active planning, development, and operation of the PC-III network. The PC-III security program will be
highly successful if it receives the required amount of management support.

1.6. System Requirements. The GSA is responsible for controlling access to the PC-III network. When a request
is received, the GSA must access the appropriate EP and perform any action necessary under the User
Management utility.

Section C--System Administration Policy and Responsibilities

1.7. System Administration Policy. Overall responsibility for operation and maintenance of PC-III belongs to the
PSM who is collocated with the PC-III gateway (GW) computer. Normally, this is the active duty PSM, but in
some cases it may be the CPF PSM. In some cases, responsibilities can be delegated to non-gateway PSMs who are
geographically separated from the GW installation or PSMs whose access requirements are limited to a single
endpoint (EP).

1.7.1. Gateway System Administrator (GSA). The GSA is the host PSM and, as such, is responsible for the entire
PC-III network. The gateway and core endpoint will reside in the GSA’s office; therefore, the PSM works for the
entire base. All PC-III users are customers of the GSA, who must be responsive to all of them. Gas will use a
variety of menu-driven applications to maintain the network. Access is available to all gateway applications and
UNIX Shell. GSA are responsible for ensuring system availability and reliability. They will track transactions and
ensure products are distributed and records are updated. Table 1.1 lists GSA responsibilities.

1.7.2. Endpoint System Administrator (ESA). Normally an ESA is a PSM from the host PSM office. GSA is
used, as a login, to denote the GW only; all other EPs have an ESA. An ESA is an EP PSM responsible for that
particular EP. All PSMs from the host PSM office will have a GSA login on the GW and an ESA login on all
other EPs. In some configurations, there are EPs where it is not practical for the host PSM office (GSA) to
function as the ESA. In these cases, an on-site individual may be designated as ESA and given sufficient training
to function as such. ANG and AFRes PSM offices act as ESAs for their EPs. ESAs also have access to all
applications resident on an EP. They are responsible for all actions on their EPs including login control and
troubleshooting. Table 1.1 lists ESA responsibilities.

1.7.3. Endpoint Administrator (EPA). EPAs are persons from base units who have EPs in their offices. They are
the front-line liaisons between the GSA and base users. They have a broad base of responsibilities including
equipment custodian and trouble shooting. Applications for EPAs are mainly to view only with very few menu
items that actually involve action. EPA is an additional duty for someone in the orderly room ordinarily and PSMs
must take this into account. Table 1.1 lists EPA responsibilities.

1.7.4. Non-Host PSMs. Other PSM types are within the PC-III system. The first are AFRes and ANG PSMs
(RPSM and GPSM). The current configuration and plans expect RPSMs and GPSMs to be responsible for their
EPs and to complete all actions on them. The other PSM types are active duty and civilian PSMs (APSM and
CPSM). These are used at every Air Force installation configured with PC-III that has a collocated CPF/MPF.
AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5      1 March 1997                                                                        11

1.7.4.1. CPF Host. When the CPF is the host PSM for the installation, it becomes the GSA/ESA office. This is
only planned for the AFMC bases at this time. With the CPF PSM as the GSA/ESA, the military PSM will be
given an APSM login to use in support of MPF functions only.

1.7.4.2. MPF Host. When the MPF is the host PSM for the installation, it becomes the GSA/ESA office. This
configuration is prevalent at over 95% of the installations to receive PC-III. The CPF PSM will be given a CPSM
login, which has limited access to the system, to use in support of CPF functions only.

1.8. PC-III Design. The design of PC-III allows integration with other functional systems (existing or planned)
and allows for maximum use of computer resources already in the Air Force inventory. Interoperability exists or
will exist among PC-III, base level mainframe systems, AFPC systems, MAJCOM distributed data processing
systems, and Combat Personnel Control System (CPCS). Interoperability with other base level functional systems
is desirable.

1.9. Access Requirements. Access to PC-III will be determined by the operational need of the individual. The
approval authority for PC-III logins is the GSA, who will approve and build all logins on the network, excluding
ANG and AFRes EPs. Each base organization will be responsible for determining who within the organization
needs access and what level that access should be.

1.9.1. PSM Access. GSA and ESA logins will not be built for anyone outside the GSA office, such as ANG and
AFRes EP PSMs or extreme remote EPs. These logins have UNIX Shell access and are for PSMs only. The GSA
must ensure that no user outside the GSA office is given a login with UNIX Shell access.

1.9.2. CPF/MPF Access. CPF/MPF chiefs and section chiefs are authorized to request logins for
CPF/MPF-assigned persons, who will be assigned the appropriate CPF/MPF user class.

1.9.3. Unit Access. Unit commander or their duly authorized representative are designated to request access for
persons assigned to their units. Access should be limited to the extent required to complete a person’s taskings.
Orderly room personnel should not be granted commander access. The only persons granted this access would be
commanders, first sergeants, and executive officers. TDY approval authority access should be given to those
individuals who have the authority to approve TDYs only. Customer service access may be delegated to any person
with easy access to a terminal location to be used for orderly room customer service. Work center access is
reserved for large unit branches with a central administration position, such as an aircraft maintenance unit or a
technical administration office. Such access allows for complete updates and generation of personnel forms. Work
centers can be a great value for an orderly room’s workload problems. All access within a unit is requested under
the unit commander’s signature.

1.9.4. Staff Agency Access. Staff agencies are considered to be wing/base level agencies falling outside the
normal operating squadron. These agencies include, but are not limited to, CPF, education office, social actions,
etc. Such agency directors are authorized to sign letters of request for PC-III access. Access limit will be that of
the functional work center.

1.9.5. Wing Commander and Staff Access. Wing commander access will be granted to the wing commander and
designated (by the commander) official only. All others at this level will receive wing staff access. Wing deputies
(DO, MA, etc.) will receive the appropriate logins as requested. In these instances, the deputy may request access
via letter; the GSA will verify the position and approve the request.

                                          SYSTEM FUNDAMENTALS

Section A--Systems Overview

2.1. Systems Architecture. The PC-III systems architecture provides an automated link to the existing personnel
system. This link gives endpoint (EP) level users, orderly rooms, and designated base level agencies (for example,
security police, hospital, etc.) the ability to access data immediately. Various levels of the network (HQ USAF,
base, CPF, and EPs) are designed to maintain their own functional capabilities independently. PC-III incorporates
extensive user-friendly tutorials (menus, help screens, etc.) to help users accomplish routine personnel actions by
using terminals located in work centers and other key areas. Automated forms combine direct customer inputs
with standard information from the personnel data base. The current manually intensive unit interaction with the
base level personnel system (BLPS) is simplified for many daily activities.

2.2. System Application. Types of PC-III users include commanders and staff agencies (RM, DO, etc.); unit
orderly rooms; individuals; civilian resource managers; active, AFRes, ANG CPFs and MPFs; non-personnel
activities (for example, security police, finance, etc.); and major unit work centers. It provides more timely
information and better service to Air Force members at all levels. PC-III decentralizes over 2,000 characters of
information on each person, military and civilian; provides the ability to maintain personnel information; and
allows commanders and managers near real-time retrieval capability for alpha rosters and other routine reports.
Update of personnel data is limited to elements authorized for input at the activity level. A central gateway
computer connects with each EP processor (for example, orderly rooms, staff agencies, etc.), as well as the Phase
IV system and AFPC computers. Over this network, users can send and receive messages, letters, reports, and
other information to and from other bases, MAJCOMs, and AFPC.

2.3. Equipment Configuration. The equipment configuration that comprises a PC-III network consists of the
following:

2.3.1. Gateway (GW). The GW is a combination communications processor and mini-computer system with a
portable operating system environment (POSE) platform. It provides the software interface to several EP
processors, various host computers, and communications networks. The GW provides the key link in the PC-III
network.

2.3.2. EP Processor (EP). The EP is a communications processor and mini-computer system with a POSE
platform. It connects to a GW and directly supports PC-III work centers (staff agency, CPF, etc.). EPs interface
with the AFPC, Sperry Phase IV (base level), and other computers through the GW.

2.3.3. PC-III Communications Network. The communications network connects all terminals with an EP, all EPs
to the GW, and the GW to external systems such as AFPC, Sperry Phase IV, and other DDN hosts.

2.3.4. Terminals. A personal computer (PC) that can emulate a VT-100 terminal or an AT&T-605 terminal used
to access the PC-III network.

2.3.5. Printers. The PC-III system uses two printer types:

2.3.5.1. A high-speed (up to 10 pages per minute) letter-quality laser printer for forms and letter preparation.

2.3.5.2. A medium-speed (near letter-quality) dot matrix printer to be used as either companion (screen prints) or
as EP system printers.

2.4. Equipment Requirements. The overall objective of PC-III is to provide the best possible support for
customers by reducing time-consuming paper processes and labor-intensive personnel procedures. The standard
multi-user small computer requirements contract (SMSCRC) details specific equipment requirements to achieve
this objective. The UNIX V operating system is the primary driver.

AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5      1 March 1997                                                                      19

2.5. Virtual Managers (VMs). VMs are individual software programs that direct specific actions taking place.
These actions include but are not limited to menus, security, mail, and applications. The report VM formats
information into usable products for online review or printing. It accepts data from the application VM to
assemble and format reports in various configurations (informational, statistical arrays, etc.). It has the ability to
control the placement and format of fields, headings, footings, page numbers, and column titles. This alleviates
the need for many user-requested DESIREs, as reports are accessible at the EP level. Reports can be generated
whenever required. The PC-III report VM is not a replacement for the BLPS DESIRE system. It is an addition
which provides an alternative retrieval method. The PSM should ensure that PC-III reports are not duplicated by
DESIRE. For more information on individual VMs, see, chapter 4.

2.5.1. VM Operations. A VM has operations that act on data under its control. The data and VMs reside on each
individual EP. Each VM has a driver, its own private data, and a set of defined operations to manipulate the data.
The driver for each VM uses a standard interface procedure call (VMcall) for input and output. Each manager is
self contained and does not directly depend on another manager to function.

2.5.2. Error Handling. If an error or reject occurs outside the PC-III application, the affected record is reset to the
original value during the refresh process. Error messages are routed through OA to the input source for review and
action. The application can be reinput with correct information if the reject is returned to the CPF.

Section B--System Fundamentals

2.6. The Online System. Under PC-III, information systems technology is used to provide administrative and
personnel support to orderly rooms and work centers in operational units. Its goals are to provide timely mission
information to commanders and managers and better service to individuals. The system is designed to be on line
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

2.7. Computer System Access. The PC-III concept allows all PC-III units access to individual records. This
access may be limited to specific work centers, units, staff agencies, or base-wide access (wing commander).
Unauthorized access poses a greater risk than under BLPS. It is imperative that commanders and managers at all
levels ensure that remote access is monitored, only authorized personnel use the PC-III terminals, and retrieved
data is considered privileged and used for official business only. They must also ensure that classified information
is not introduced into the system and all personnel using PC-III terminals are aware of their responsibilities for
computer terminal access and release of data from the system.

2.8. Database and Edits. The software platform of PC-III supports five general environments: Production,
Application Development, System Management, Office Management, and External. It provides a totally
menu-driven capability so that users in the orderly room, personnel office, or a staff agency can input, process, and
output data. BLPS data identification numbers (DIN) are used to communicate with the PDS; however, they are
not visible to users. Reasons for not passing edits will be displayed in cleartext on the PC-III terminal at the time
of transaction update in most cases. In other cases, rejects occur at BLPS and are returned to the user’s EP. Audit
trails have been established for the PSM’s use to ensure database accuracy.

2.9. Record Type. PC-III records are stored on every EP; they are accessed by record type and SSN: for civilians,
officers, and airmen.

2.9.1. PC-III Database Query VM. Tables used to support PC-III operations are maintained on the database query
VM; they are used to determine database layouts, characteristics, and locations within the PC-III network. This
VM comprises three major tables: Standard Data Element Routing, Local Data Element Routing, and Database
Locator Table.

2.9.2. PC-III System VM. While each VM in PC-III has a driver that handles such things as checking security
and integrity, writing the audit trail, performing configuration management checks, dealing with other VM
communication, and performing operations as received in its queue, the system VM is the network driver. It
provides facilities to establish backups and recoveries, signals to invoke end-of-day procedures in each VM,
accumulates audit trails from each VM, and analyzes them to take actions to ensure continued integrity.

20                                                                    AFMAN 36-2622         Volume 5     1 March 1997

2.10. Data Handling. The decision logic table (DLT) VM controls data handling under PC-III. It handles data
editing and the resulting actions from successful or unsuccessful edits; fully implements the functionality of DLT
technology; and expands current BLPS implementation. The DLT language, SAMUEL, is part of the DLT VM
private memory. The database maintenance manager provides for storage of standard and unique data, a data
dictionary of EP data elements, database reorganizations, mass file conversions, and centralized local encode and
decode tables.

2.11. Database Maintenance Manager (DBMM):

2.11.1. The DBMM maintains the tables used to determine data base layouts and characteristics, which include
the following:

2.11.1.1. PC-III long and short data names.

2.11.1.2. Encode and decode table names.

2.11.1.3. Size and class of data.

2.11.1.4. Associated relationships.

2.11.1.5. File names for references not in tables.

2.11.1.6. Record types.

2.11.2. For the most part, since PC-III is an extension of the BLPS, these tables contain similar information as
those in BLPS. The major differences are that the DINs normally associated with BLPS are not visible to the PC-III
user. User-friendly screens keep users from having to revert to a DIN table for information. Help screens that
contain information necessary to complete the update and inquiry transaction are also available. The transaction
formatter VM converts data transactions from a sender’s format to a receiver’s format. It provides the means by
which data integrity is maintained between PC-III and PDS.

2.12. PC-III Processing. Update of personnel data is limited to elements authorized for input at the EP level.
Data is subjected to limited validity and compatibility editing. Unlike BLPS, PC-III can operate when the base
level (Phase IV) system is down. Each unit and agency has access to records assigned to it; for example, a supply
squadron orderly room can access records of all civilian and military personnel assigned to that unit.

2.13. PC-III Refresh. When an updated record is stored on the master file, it contains the new data. At the time
the record is being updated on the BLPS mainframe, any vertical transactions that must be sent to AFPC or
MAJCOM are generated and stored, and the record is flagged for EOD processing. During EOD processing (S00),
all flagged records are refreshed back to all EPs that contain the record. If the data being updated fails the BLPS
edits, the BLPS record is flagged but not updated. Rather, the existing (old) BLPS information is refreshed back to
the EP from which the record was updated, and a reject message explaining the transaction failure is generated to
the input source.

2.14. Access to PC-III. PC-III system access is controlled by the gateway systems administrator (GSA) or
endpoint systems administrator (ESA) who issues logins and passwords. Submit requests for access by letter as
described in figure 1.3. Unit commanders should sign letters for unit personnel; staff agency chiefs should sign
letters for staff agency personnel. When an individual no longer requires access due to retirement, reassignment,
resignation, etc., be sure to notify the GSA.

2.15. Login and Password Procedures. The login is a string of lower case, alphabetical characters normally
consisting of the first letter of the user’s first name and up to seven letters of the last name; for example, Robert M.
Jones would be assigned the login “rjones”. This login is assigned to establish and maintain accountability for all
actions taken in PC-III.


AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5     1 March 1997                                                                     21

2.15.1. The first time you use your login, the system will generate four passwords; the original one will have
expired.

2.15.2. The system will then ask you to choose one and type the number.

2.15.3. The system will prompt you to memorize the password and enter it into the system. It will not be
displayed on the screen as you enter it.

2.15.4. If you enter the login or the password incorrectly, the system will prompt you to retype it. Once your
password is successfully entered, you are ready to use PC-III.

2.15.5. Figure 2.1 contains detailed login instructions.

2.16. PC-III Screens. Four kinds of screens are available in PC-III: menu, SSN prompt, data entry, and help
screens.

2.16.1. Menu Screens. The first screen you see when accessing PC-III will be a menu screen. As the name
implies, it gives a list of topics from which to select. The menu structure was created to go from a broad, general
area to an area dealing specifically with a personnel action or program.

2.16.1.1. The first one is always called the main menu. Table 2.1 shows selections available to various user
classes.

2.16.1.2. After you make a selection, another menu called a sub-menu may appear. It may take as many as six of
them to get to the action you need. To make a selection, press the Transmit (+) key at the far right of the keyboard
to continue.

2.16.1.3. You can directly access an application (bypass sub-menus) by pressing the F4 key, selecting the Search
command, and inserting the menu name in the space which appears at the center of the screen.

2.16.2. SSN/CPCN Prompt Screens. Use these screens to identify the record or records you need to access. Type
the CPCN or the SSN and record type of the employee whose record you want. If you do not know the record type,
there is an F4 prompt that tells you the available record types. There are prompt screens for both single and
multiple (as many as 10) records.

2.16.3. Data Entry Screens. Use these screens to change data in a record or to insert information to be generated
on a printed form. Be careful when changing a record; the transaction processes immediately and cannot be
retrieved.

2.16.4. Help Screens. Several screens exist in PC-III to help you use general and function keys, make selections
on data entry screens, and provide information on the personnel application being used

2.16.4.1. Use the F9 key for information on key usage at the menu, SSN prompt, and data entry screen levels.

2.16.4.2. Use the F1, F2, and F4 keys while working with data entry screens.

2.16.4.2.1. F1 gives information on various selections and helps you make the right choice for the specific screen
with which you are working.

2.16.4.2.2. F2 gives a broad overview of the entire application with which you are working.
2.16.4.2.3. F4 contains the actual selection choices to input for a specific data field; for example, geographic
preferences, TDY reasons, etc. In some instances, F4 drives a search function to help locate certain items within a
list.

2.16.4.3. The Command Line (see paragraph 2.17) at the bottom of each screen will indicate which help keys are
available for that screen.

22                                                                  AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5      1 March 1997

2.17. Command Lines. At the bottom of each PC-III screen is a command line, which lists options to help you
make more selections in PC-III; they will vary from screen to screen. Here is a list that explains the functions of
those options.

2.17.1. F1=Help, F2=Help, and F1/2=Help. The display of any of these at a data entry screen indicates that some
kind of help screen is available. Within a Help screen, the command line tells you how to move the screen up and
down and how to exit it and return to the application on which you were working.

2.17.2. F3/Esc=Exit, F3=Exit, and Esc=Exit. The display of one of these indicates that you can use either or both
of those keys to exit from where you are to the previous screen or menu. NOTE: In some instances F3 functions as
a transmit key.

2.17.3. F4=Prompt/F4=Search. PROMPT means that there is a list of choices for a particular data entry field from
which you can select the appropriate response. SEARCH means that you can bypass menus and screens by
manually inputting a character string and go directly to the application or selection.

2.17.4. F5=Refresh. If the screen contains garbled material, you can clear it or "repaint" the screen by pressing
F5.

2.17.5. F7/PgUp and F8/PgDn. Use these keys to move to subsequent or previous pages of a multiple-page
application.

2.17.6. F9=Key Help. For a quick review of the various key functions, press F9.

2.17.7. F10-Menu. If a menu bar containing one or more options is at the top of the screen, press F10 to access it.
If a menu bar is not at the top but F10 is listed in the Command Line, press F10 to display it. In many functions,
the only option is QUIT. Some functions, particular in the systems areas, allow you to access other records, print,
and temporarily move over to Office Automation and work on other files. Use the Right and Left Arrows to move
among menu bar choices.

2.17.8. Space=Mark. This indicates that to make a selection, you must place the cursor on the line of the item to
be selected and press the Space Bar. If you press it a second time, you will deselect the item. In other instances,
you must make selections by typing an X, so make note of the Command Line to see if this command is displayed.

2.17.9. Transmit (+). This indicates that pressing this key will access, load, send, or save whatever function on
which you are currently working.

2.17.10. In Office Automation, command lines, also called menu bars, appearing across the top of the screen
display options available for Office Automation products, such as VIEW, EDIT, PRINT, DELETE, BOARDS, and
QUIT.

2.18. System Comments. Whenever you take an action in PC-III, the computer displays a message on the status
of that action. Here are some of the most frequently seen comments:

2.18.1. Working. This indicates that while you are waiting for a response to the action, the system is active. A
counter will show how long the application is taking to process.

2.18.2. Counting Records. This indicates that the system has selected records and is counting and sorting them.
2.18.3. Record Updated. This confirms that your update transaction processed within PC-III.

2.18.4. All Transactions Rejected. This tells you that the update failed and why. If the reason provided is not
clear, you may need to get in touch with the CPF for an explanation.

2.18.5. No Records Found. This indicates one of three situations: A record did not exist for the SSN input; the
SSN is good, but the record is not on your endpoint; or the report you requested did not select any records meeting
the criteria.
AFMAN 36-2622 Volume 5 1 March 1997                                                                               23

2.18.6. Application Will Complete in Background. This indicates that a report requested is being processed and
will be placed in Office Automation.

2.18.7. Screen Completed Normally. This indicates that you have transmitted your input and that the system is
acknowledging receipt of it.

2.18.8. Screen Canceled by User. This indicates that you have terminated the application, usually after pressing
Esc.

2.19. PC-III Control and Function Keys. Table 2.2 lists standard control and function keys and their uses.
Many applications in PC-III are in the ACCELL format, and key usage for them differs somewhat from that of the
standard keys. See table 2.3 for a list of those keys and their normal default uses.

2.20. Inquiries. PC-III has three kinds of inquiries: single, multiple, and reports. Immediate inquiry requests
cause data to be displayed immediately on the terminal used to enter the requests. A PC-III inquiry extracts the
contents of predefined data items from the EP record. Data is retrieved from the EP database and is currently
limited to preprogrammed requests.

2.20.1. Single Inquiry. Access one record.

2.20.2. Multiple Inquiry. Input as many as 10 SSNs/CPCNs, depending on the application, at the prompt screen
to receive information on all records selected.

2.20.3. Reports. PC-III reports provide an array of information on records selected. Some are found on the menu
under the personnel program to which they pertain; others are found under the main menu title Reports and RIPs.
After a report is completed, it goes to Office Automation, Production, and Products.

2.21. Updates:

2.21.1. You can update the EP computer, even if the BLPS mainframe is down. Data being updated to a record
must pass basic data accuracy and validity edits. If data is found to be in accordance with the edits, three different
actions may occur.

2.21.1.1. The EP data base is updated and the data is passed to the transaction formatter virtual manager (TFVM)
which arranges the data into Mailman packets and passes it to the GW where it is stored until called for by the
BLPS mainframe. Here again, the data is carefully edited. If the data passes the BLPS edits, it is accepted and
replaces the old data in the record.

2.21.1.2. The EP database is not updated, but the data is passed to the TFVM which processes it as a normal
update.

2.21.1.3. The Interactive Communications Interface (ICI) takes the transaction directly to the SBLC. If the
transaction updates the record, it will send new data back. If not, a reject will be sent immediately to the Updt-Rej
directory.

2.21.2. PC-III offers two types of updates:

2.21.2.1. Single Update. Update data on one record.
2.21.2.2. Multiple Update. Update the same data on as many as 10 records at once.

2.22. Reports. As stated in paragraph 2.20.3 reports are another form of inquiry in PC-III. Managers and
supervisors use them as sources of information to monitor various personnel programs and the status of employees
whom they supervise. PC-III reports are intended to replace reports and rosters the CPF used to provide on a
periodic basis.


24                                                                   AFMAN 36-2622         Volume 5      1 March 1997

2.22.1. Some reports have the option to limit the selection to certain grades, pay plans, periods of time, etc while
others select everyone.

2.22.2. Some reports have a Help screen (F2) behind them that shows how the report format looks.

2.22.3. PC-III reports run in the background; therefore, while a report is collecting data and formatting, the
terminal is still available for use.

2.22.4. When the report is completed, it goes to Office Automation. See paragraph 3.17 for information on
viewing reports.

2.22.5. The CRON suspense system can automatically produce frequently requested reports. Give the name of the
report and when it is to be run to the PSM, who can then set it up in CRON. The only limitation is that only
reports requiring no interaction--no parameters or variables input--can be set up in CRON.

2.22.6. See chapter 10 for a list and description of reports available under the Reports and RIPs menu.

2.23. RIPs. Two types of RIPs are produced in PC-III: user requested and automatically produced because of an
event. RIP formats have been redesigned for PC-III to tailor the products to an 80-column output format. Each
RIP is packaged, flows through the PC-III Mailman network, and resides on the EP until called for by the user,
who can review and/or print the product:

2.23.1. To request a RIP, select Reports and RIPs on the main menu and then RIPs on the sub-menu. Although no
civilian RIPs are presently available under this menu, some RIP requests are imbedded in individual applications.

2.23.2. At the next screen, type the SSN and record type and a list of RIPs will be displayed.

2.23.3. Wherever in PC-III you request a RIP, it is produced in OA Reports on Individual Personnel: In the
employee’s work center if one exists, or in the unit civilian resource manager’s office if one exists, or in the orderly
room.

2.23.4. PC-III sends the RIP request to BLPS to run; it is normally processed at night and available the next day:

2.23.4.1. RIPs which are automatically generated are also produced by BLPS and flow electronically to Office
Automation, Production and Products for viewing and printing.

2.23.4.2. RIPs run on employees assigned to non-PC-III units default to Office Automation of the CPF work center
that is the OPR for those RIPs.

2.24. Reject Notices. Information entered at a PC-III screen goes through several checks before the computer
accepts it:

2.24.1. At the screen level, edits check the validity of the input and reject it if a problem exists. A reject remark
also appears, giving the reason for the reject.
2.24.2. If the input passes the screen level edits, it is edited again when it reaches BLPS. If it fails the edits at this
level, a reject comes back through Office Automation, Updates and Rejects, with a short message as to why the
input failed.

2.24.3. Another series of edits occurs at the Headquarters Air Force (HAF) files level. If the input passes both the
PC-III and BLPS level edits but rejects at the HAF level, the reject is sent back to the appropriate CPF work center
who passes it to the initiator to correct.

2.25. Transaction Registers (TRs). Another feature of PC-III is the routing of management notices to unit
orderly rooms.

AFMAN 36-2622         Volume 5      1 March 1997                                                                       25

2.25.1. These notices, commonly called TRs, indicate actions a unit must take or information needed to make
personnel decisions affecting employees or personnel programs. Other TRs indicate that something has changed
on the data base which may impact a personnel program.

2.25.2. TRs are processed from the BLPS through PC-III to the unit. Within PC-III, TRs go to a unit’s OA
Transaction Registers. It is possible that files having several TRs will be received daily at a unit orderly room. An
orderly room should not delete a file of TRs until the actions required are taken. The CPF will receive its normal
TRs from BLPS.

2.26. Laser Forms and Letters. Several PC-III applications produce laser forms or letters.

2.26.1. Laser Forms. These are images of the cut-sheet versions of SF/DD/AF forms. Many applications
producing laser forms have menu titles such as Produce DD Form 1556, Request, Authorization Agreement,
Certification of Training and Reimbursement. The data entry screen used within an application to complete a
laser form does not look like the actual form itself. After you transmit a data entry screen that produces a laser
form, you will receive the comment Application Will Complete in the Background. Go in to the OA Production
and Products environment where you can view, edit, print, or delete the form. When requesting the form be
printed, be sure to select a laser printer as a dot matrix printer will not produce the actual form.

2.26.2. Laser Letters. These work the same way as forms. The applications which produce laser letters allow text
to be added and are produced in a standard military letter format. Laser letters also go to the OA Production and
Products where they are viewed, edited, printed, or deleted.

Section C--Menu Options

2.27. Introduction. At the PC-III Main Menu and at certain sub-menus, the top menu bar across the screen will
display the following items: CUSTOM OPTIONS, DISPLAY ENVIRONMENT, RUN APPLIC, and QUIT. Press
F10 to access this bar, use the Left and Right Arrows to make your selection, and press Transmit; or type the first
letter of the option.

2.28. Custom Options. Use this to create a customized menu, modify a menu, delete a menu, and move back and
forth between the standard menus and your customized menu. By customizing your menu, you will be able to
access frequently used items more rapidly and bypass altogether those you use infrequently or not at all:

2.28.1. Switch to Custom Menus. If you are in the standard menu mode, use this to change to your custom menu.
If you do not have a custom menu, a message will tell you.

2.28.1.2. Create/Edit/Delete Custom Menu. Use this to create a menu, add to or delete items from it, or remove it
altogether:

2.28.1.2.1. Create or Modify Custom Menu. Select this and a list of all available menu items will be displayed. If
you are creating a new custom menu, each will be coded with a V (visible). To mask each item you do not want
displayed in the customized menu, type an I (invisible) in the brackets [ ] at the left of it. If you are modifying an
existing custom menu, you can also change items previously coded I back to V by typing V in the brackets. After
you finish editing, press Transmit to save the changes. A message will tell you that your custom menu has been
created or updated, as applicable. Press return to continue.

2.28.1.2.2. Remove Custom Menu. Select this and a message will warn you that the custom menu will be deleted.
Type Y to remove it or N if you change your mind; press Transmit. A message will tell you that your custom menu
has been removed. Press return to continue.

2.28.2. Switch to Standard Hierarchical Menus. This is the reverse process of SWITCH TO CUSTOM MENUS.
Use this if you need to access an item not visible on your customized menu.



26                                                                   AFMAN 36-2622         Volume 5      1 March 1997

2.29. Other Options.

2.29.1. Display Environment. Use this to display the system under which you are running. It may be useful in
tracing system problems. A user message will display information such as unit, office, DB access, terminal,
endpoint, login ID, user ID, and group ID.

2.29.2. Run Applic. This option is used to test and run new applications before they are released to the field. If
you are able to access it, notify your PSM. Your machine is improperly configured.

2.29.3. Quit. Use this if you want to do either of two things: EXIT PC-III MENU SYSTEM and EXIT MENU
BAR. Make your choice and press Transmit.

Figure 2.1. PC-III Login Procedures:

1. You will receive your first login and password from the GSA. More than likely, you will first use it during
initial PC-III training. If you are using a smart terminal, the PC3VT emulator must be activated. When you have
done this, press Return once to look at a login prompt:

              login:

2. The login will consist of the first letter of your first name and up to seven letters of your last name. For
example, the login for Barbara Stapleton would be bstaplet. Always type it in lower case letters.

3. PC-III is very particular when it comes to accepting logins and passwords. If you make an error while typing
the login or password, you can correct it only by pressing Shift/@ and starting over or by pressing Return until you
receive a new login prompt and starting over. Never use Caps Lock when you enter your login or password.

4. After you enter your login, the system will ask for a password. It will consist of eight random letters, each of
which may be upper or lower case. Remember, if you make an error while typing in the password, press Shift/@
and reenter it or press Return to get a new login prompt. The password will not be displayed on the screen.


                  login: bstaplet
                  Password:


5. One of two things will happen. If you made an error while entering your login and password, a LOGIN
INCORRECT message and a new login prompt will appear. Just start again. If you entered the login and
password correctly, the screen should appear similar to this:


            login: bstaplet
            Password:
            Your password has expired. Choose a new one
            /bin/passwd: Changing password for bstaplet
            Old Password:


6. Type the password one more time and press Return. Remember, the password is not displayed on the screen as
it is typed.




AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5     1 March 1997                                                                   27

Figure 2.1. Continued.

After you enter the password, press Return to see the new password choices. The screen should appear similar to
this:


          login: bstaplet
          Password:
          Your password has expired. Choose a new one
          /bin/password: Changing password for bstaplet
          Old Password:
          Working . . .
          Hit return to see passwords . . .

          Pick one of the following . . .
          1. tidnffle (spelled t-i-D-n-f-f-l-e)
          2. dethysur (spelled D-E-T-H-y-S-U-R)
          3. twssatra (spelled t-w-s-s-a-t-r-A)
          4. maliswin (spelled M-A-L-i-S-W-I-N)

17    F17                             Last Record         Advance to the last record (if multiple); this
                                                          will tell how many records were selected.
18    F18                                                 No default assigned.
19    F19                                                 No default assigned.
20    F20                                                 No default assigned.
21    PgUp                            Page Up             Return to the previous record (if multiple);
                                                          same as F7.
22    PgDn                            Page Down           Advance to the next record (if multiple);
                                                          same as F8.

NOTES:
1. The above uses are programmed defaults, but they may be changed to accommodate special requirements for
particular applications. Any differences in usage for an application will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.
2. Function key F11 through F20 can be accessed by using the Shift key and F1 through F10 keys in numerical
sequence; for example, F12 = Shift/F2; F16 = Shift/F6; F19 = Shift/F9; etc.
3. In the Automated Merit Certificate Process, also in the ACCELL format, these keys differ significantly in
function.

                                             OFFICE AUTOMATION

Section A--Office Automation Environments

3.1. Introduction. Office Automation (OA) is the PC-III function through which various user processes occur
(sending files between users with electronic mail, producing rosters, etc.):

3.1.1. Environments. OA consists of 10 major areas, or environments: Reports--Production and Products,
Email--Electronic Office Mail, Updt-Rej--Updates and Rejects, SURFs-- Single Unit Rtvl Formats,
Private--Prelude Information System, Coord--Incoming Coordinations, Status--Coordination Status,
History--History Coordinations, RIPs--Reports on Individual Personnel, and TRs--Transaction Registers.

3.1.2. Directories and Files. Each OA environment will be defined and its uses described in the following
paragraphs. First, two terms need to be defined:

3.1.2.1. Directory: A list of products (reports, letters, messages, forms, etc.), that appears as soon as you enter an
environment. The first entry is the root directory, identified by .. under the Package Name or Subject heading. If
there are no products, this will be the only entry.

3.1.2.2. File: A product itself. Within PC-III, a directory contains a list of products or files.

3.1.3. Options. Specific options are accessible through the use of the F10 function key. See Section B for details
on what they do and how they work; also, see table 3.1 for a summary of which options are available in each
environment. NOTE: The Prelude Information System is in an entirely different format and only the List Private
Directory menu item has any of these options available.

3.1.4. Key Usage. Except for Prelude, in which function key usage is different, most keys in OA function
similarly to those of other PC-III applications. Some variations exist and are covered here:

3.1.4.1. Space=Mark. Use the Space Bar to place an X next to or mark one or more files in a directory before
accessing the F10 menu bar. You can mark as many files as you wish. To remove an X, press the Space Bar a
second time.

3.1.4.2. Insert=MarkAll. Use the Ins key if you want to place Xs next to or mark all files in a directory before
accessing the F10 menu bar.

3.1.4.3. Delete=UnmarkAll. Use the Del key to remove all marks or Xs; this is the reverse of using the Ins key.

3.2. Production and Products (Reports). This environment is a central collection and processing point for
forms, letters, and reports created by the various PC-III applications. When a PC-III process which generates a
printable form or report is completed, the product is sent to and saved in Production and Products. In this
environment, you can view and edit files, mail them to other users, or save them before they are printed. When
files have been reviewed and are no longer required, they should be deleted. The Production and Products
directory contains several information columns:

3.2.1. X. An X in this column indicates that a file has been selected.

3.2.2. Package Name. An external file name to help in identifying a file.

3.2.3. OA Keys. Various items of identifying information, such as a user’s logname or the name or SSN of the
person whose data is in a file.

3.2.4. Size. The number of characters of information in a file, including control information passed along with
the file.
32                                                                 AFMAN 36-2622 Volume 5 1 March 1997

3.2.5. Date/Time. The date and time a package was created or last modified. Whenever you use the EDIT,
DELETE, and MOVE commands, the date and time will change; otherwise, they will remain the same.

3.2.6. Type. The type of file:

3.2.6.1. Dir. A directory, such as .. or Trashcan.

3.2.6.2. Ascii. An ASCII file.

3.2.6.3. Prod. A production file created from a PC-III application; it can be a letter, a form, or a report.

3.2.6.4. Empty. A file containing no data; it should be deleted.

3.2.6.5. Bad. A file that OA software is unable to translate; it should be deleted.

3.2.6.6. Data. A file other than an ASCII or PC3-prod file; the data is not viewable and the file should be deleted.

3.2.7. To access a file, highlight it and press the Space Bar to mark it with an X. Repeat this for other files, if
needed, and press F10. Select the appropriate menu bar option and press Transmit. To unmark a file, press the
Space Bar again.

3.3. Electronic Office Mail (Email). Email is available to an entire office, and each mail message is stored as a
file. Files can be manipulated just as reports and forms in Production and Products can. In this environment, you
can view and edit files, mail them to other users, or save them before they are printed. The Email directory has
several information columns:

3.3.1. Subject. The file name.

3.3.2. From. The sender.

3.3.3. Size. The number of data characters in the file.

3.3.4. Data. The date the file was created.

3.3.5. Type. The type of file:

3.3.5.1. Dir. A directory, such as .. or Trashcan.

3.3.5.2. Email. An electronic mail message.

3.3.5.3. Ascii. An ASCII file.
3.3.6. To access a file, highlight it and press the Space Bar to mark it with an X. Repeat this step for subsequent
files, if needed, and press F10. Select the appropriate menu bar option and press Transmit.

3.3.7. See Section B, below, for information on options. When files are no longer required, they should be deleted.

3.4. Updates and Rejects (Updt-Rej). The directory is basically the same as Production and Products except that
it contains only BLPS updates and rejects. The Package Name is either UPDATE or REJECT, the OA Keys
column has the logname of the user who caused the transaction to flow to the BLPS, and the Type column is either
Dir or Trans. Use this the same way as you would use a transaction register checking to make sure all updates
processed correctly and you identify and correct those that did not. Endpoint users cannot retransmit a transaction
if it rejects:

3.4.1. To access an UPDATE or REJECT file, highlight it, press the Space Bar to mark it with an X, and press
F10. Select the appropriate menu bar option and press Transmit.

AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5     1 March 1997                                                                    33

3.4.2. CPF users have the capability to correct rejects and resubmit them to DCPDS; to do so, follow these steps.
Select EDIT at the menu bar and press Transmit to enter the Prelude editor; remember that the function keys work
differently. Remove all extraneous lines above and below the update transaction. Correct the rejected transaction
and press F1 to save the changes and exit. Select PROCESS at the menu bar and press Transmit. Continue to
monitor the corrected transaction to make sure it does flow to the BLPS.

3.5. Single Uniform Retvl Formats (SURFs). The directory is basically the same as Production and Products
except that it contains only SURFs. The Type column is either Dir or PC3-surf. To access a SURF, highlight it
and press the Space Bar to mark it with an X. Repeat this step for subsequent SURFs, if needed, and press F10.
Select the appropriate menu bar option and press Transmit.

3.6. Prelude Information System (Private). While Email is available to an entire office, Prelude mail is private
correspondence between two users. Prelude allows you to complete office automation functions in your private
directory. It contains a word processor for creating letters, documents, etc. which you can edit and print. It also
has a mail system that allows you to send and receive private mail to and from other system users on the endpoint.
The word processor and mail systems are interactive with PC-III, using a process called Boards. NOTE: Prelude
uses different function keys to perform its various processes. Please note the action bar menu located at the bottom
of the screen. See the GSA’s AT&T user manuals for more information:

3.6.1. Moving Files within Prelude. Choose a Prelude application that makes use of Boards. In this environment,
Boards has four sub-options; explanations of how they work follow:

3.6.1.1. Read from a Clipboard. Use this to read or copy a clipboard to your current file. If you are bringing a file
from PC-III to Prelude, be sure to set the proper margins. In PC-III, the left and right margins are 1 and 80
(ragged). Place the cursor at the position in the file where you want to copy the clipboard. Press F3; select
BOARDS and READ; at the prompt, type the name of the board and press Return. The clipboard will be added at
the cursor location.

3.6.1.2. Write to a Clipboard. Use this to "write" (copy) a text file or a block of text to a clipboard. You must be
editing the document to be copied into the clipboard. Place the cursor at the beginning of the document,
paragraph, or sentence to be copied into the clipboard. Press F3; select BOARDS and WRITE; at the prompt, type
the name of the board and press Return. Then mark the end of the text to be copied. Use the Arrow keys to
highlight the text portion and press Return; if the whole document is to be copied, use Ctrl/E to highlight it and
press Return. The text will be copied to the clipboard.

3.6.1.3. Append to a Clipboard. Use this to add or append a text block to an existing clipboard. You must be
editing the document to be appended to the clipboard. Place the cursor at the beginning of the document,
paragraph, or sentence to be appended to the clipboard. Press F3; select BOARDS and APPEND; at the prompt,
type the name of the board and press Return. At the prompt, mark the end of the text to be appended. Use the
Arrow keys to highlight the text portion and press Return; if the whole document is to be appended, use Ctrl/E to
highlight it and press Return. The text will be added to the clipboard.
3.6.1.4. Delete a Clipboard. Use this to delete a clipboard from the files. Press F3; select BOARDS and
DELETE; at the prompt, type the name of the board and press Return. The board is deleted and cannot be
recovered.

3.6.2. Moving Files from Prelude to PC-III Office Automation. Go into Prelude Information System, Word
Processor. Access the document and place the cursor at the beginning of the document or the document part that is
to be brought back to PC-III. To move files from PC-III Office Automation to Prelude, see Boards (paragraph
3.29):

3.6.2.1. Press F3 (Menu), B (Boards), and W (Write). Press F5 (Pick) and highlight the name of the board being
used. Using the Arrow keys, highlight the portion of the document to be written to the board. If writing the whole
document to the board, press Ctrl/E. Press Return. An exact copy of the portion of the document highlighted has
been written to the board named. Press F1 (Quit), Y (Yes), and Return. Press F1 (Quit) and Y (Yes); you are out
of Prelude.

34                                                                 AFMAN 36-2622         Volume 5     1 March 1997

3.6.2.2. Go into Office Automation, Production and Products. Press F10, select BOARDS, and press Transmit.
Select READ A CLIPBOARD and press Transmit. Select the board being used and press Transmit. Give the
board a new file name and press Transmit. The board has been read to Production and Products.

3.6.2.3. Press Esc to go to the Production and Products directory and mark the new file. Press F10 and V (View).
The edited document is displayed and the process is complete. This file can be modified just as any other.

3.7. Incoming Coordinations (Coord). Within this environment, some personnel actions can be processed,
routed, modified, and approved. While SF/USAFE-52 actions are processed through a system of menus (see
figures 4.1 and 5.1), others are processed through the F10 menu bar:

3.7.1. Coordination. Coordination within PC-III allows several users in different offices to review a request and
take action on it. The submitting office can route the request through these coordination points electronically.

3.7.2. Incoming Coordinations. Actions which are ready for review are sent to this directory where they can be
edited and, in some cases, the route file adjusted.

3.7.3. Initiator. The initiator is the owner which may be a unit, a work center, or a wing/staff office--wherever the
action is begun. An exception is those actions initiated by employees in customer service (for example, name
change requests). CPF Administration "owns" these actions. The initiator has overall responsibility for an action
and can track its progress in Coordination Status.

3.7.4. Reviewer. A reviewer may edit the request, add comments, indicate approval or disapproval, etc., and send
it to the next user. The last reviewer, usually the approving authority, finalizes the action and sends it to the
completion point. Reviewers receive copies of new action requests in their Incoming Coordination’s directories.

3.7.5. Routing. All actions flowing through coordination are controlled by system routing; it may be hard-coded,
dynamic, or both:

3.7.5.1. Hard-Coded Routing. Each coordination action has at least two points on its route: the origination point
(INITIATOR on the route file display) and the completion point. These start and stop points, along with any other
mandatory stops the action must make, are programmed into the system. This route is hard-coded, or fixed, and
cannot be changed by the user. Any addressee on the route file display having an R (required) in the column to the
far right cannot be deleted.

3.7.5.2. Dynamic Routing. Some routing is discretionary. You can send an action to offices outside the
hard-coded route for review, coordination, or approval or disapproval through the dynamic routing process. This
does not change the hard-coded route the request must take, but it lets you personalize the route the action takes
before it gets to the completion point by adding other reviewers who need to coordinate on the request.
3.7.6. Reviewing Coordinations. Select Office Automation, Incoming Coordinations and press Transmit. (See
paragraphs 4.53, 5.2, and 5.3 for information on SF/USAFE-52 actions.) A list of files available for review will be
displayed. To access a file, highlight it, press the Space Bar to mark it, and press F10. Select the appropriate
menu bar option and press Transmit. See Section B for an explanation of available options.

3.8. Coordination Status (Status). This environment contains the status of packages that are created as
Coordinations:

3.8.1. The Package Name is a user-friendly name that matches the Package Name of the coordination package in
Incoming Coordinations or in History Coordinations. Likewise, the OA Keys column contains a key name that
matches the OA Keys column of the coordination package in Incoming Coordinations or in History Coordinations.
The last column, Stat (Status), contains one of four entries:




AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5      1 March 1997                                                                      35

3.8.1.1. Dir. A directory, such as .. or Trashcan.

3.8.1.2. Term. A terminated package.

3.8.1.3. Comp. A completed package.

3.8.1.4. Pend. A package received that is being processed by a user identified in the route file.

3.8.2. To access a Status file, highlight it and press the Space Bar to mark it with an X. Repeat this step for
subsequent files, if needed, and press F10. Select the appropriate menu bar option and press Transmit.

3.8.3. When a coordination action has been completed, the owner and each reviewer of the package must delete
the action’s status file. Access the top menu bar, select STATUS, and press Transmit. A list of all current status
files will appear. Mark the coordination files to delete and press F10. Select DELETE from the menu bar and
press Transmit to delete the files.

3.8.4. You may delete a Status file at any time; however, until the action requested has been completed or
terminated, the status file is refreshed each time a coordination action is taken. It will continue to reappear in
Coordination Status until the action is completed and deleted.

3.9. History Coordinations (History). After an action has been completed, a copy goes to the History file at one
of two places. If a hard-coded History addressee exists, it goes to that addressee. If there is no History addressee in
the route file, it goes to the History file of whoever completes it. This copy cannot be edited:

3.9.1. The directory is basically the same as Coordination Status. To access a file, highlight it and press the Space
Bar to mark it with an X. Repeat this step for subsequent files, if needed, and press F10. Select the appropriate
menu bar option and press Transmit.

3.9.2. After you are completely finished with a file, you should delete it. However, before doing so if a problem
surfaces, you can take it out of History and place it back into Incoming Coordinations to continue processing. See
paragraph 3.31.7 for information on Reset. A COMPLETE or a TERMINATE action must be done on a
coordination file before it can be deleted. Go into History Coordinations. At the list of history files displayed,
make a note of the file name or number for reference in deleting the Status file. Highlight the file to be deleted,
mark it with an X, and press F10. Select Delete from the menu bar and press Transmit. Go into Coordination
Status. At the list of status files displayed, highlight the file to be deleted, mark it with an X, and press F10.
Select DELETE from the menu bar and Transmit.

3.10. Rpts on Individual Personnel (RIPs). The directory is basically the same as Production and Products
except that it contains only RIPs. The Package Name is the short RIP name, the OA Keys column contains the RIP
name and an SSN, and the Type column is either Dir or PC3-rip. To access a RIP, highlight it and press the Space
Bar to mark it with an X. Repeat this step for subsequent RIPs, if needed, and press F10. Select the appropriate
menu bar option and press Transmit.

3.11. Transaction Registers (TRs). The directory is basically the same as Production and Products except that it
contains only TRs. The Package Name is Transaction Registers, the OA Keys column has a dash, and the Type
column is either Dir or PC3-tr. To access a TR, highlight it; press the Space Bar to mark it with an X, repeating
for subsequent TRs, if needed; and press F10. Select the appropriate menu bar option and press Transmit.

Section B--Office Automation (F10) Commands

3.12. Introduction. Each Office Automation environment has a top menu bar, accessible by pressing F10, which
contains a series of commands to help you manage files. NOTE: The Prelude Information System has a
completely different set of commands for most of its functions; the F10 menu bar is accessible only at the LIST
PRIVATE DIRECTORY menu item. See table 3.1 for a summary of F10 options available for each Office
Automation environment. Some restrictions exist within various environments on the use of these options. When
the directory is displayed, you can select a file to manage or manipulate. Use the Up and Down Arrows to
highlight
36                                                                  AFMAN 36-2622 Volume 5 1 March 1997

it, press the Spacebar to mark it with an X, and press Transmit. To select more than one file, repeat the procedure
until all the ones you want are marked and press Transmit. To select all files in the directory, press Ins. If you
change your mind or want to select a new list of files, press Del to remove the Xs and start over. After selecting
the file or files you want, press F10 to access the menu bar. Use the Right and Left Arrows to highlight the
command you want to select and press Transmit.

3.13. View (View Marked Files). Use this to look at a file that you have marked; you cannot make any
modifications. At the directory, highlight the first file you want to view by using the Up and Down Arrows; press
the Space Bar to mark it with an X. Continue this procedure to view more than one file. Select VIEW at the menu
bar and press Transmit to view the first file. If it has more than one page, use F8 to advance and F7 to return to
previous pages. If you mark more than one file, press F3 after each to display the next. After you have finished
viewing all files, press F3 again to return to the directory.

3.14. Print (Print Marked Files). Use this to print one or more files. Highlight the file you want, press the
Space Bar to mark it with an X, and press F10 or Transmit. Select PRINT at the menu bar and press Transmit. A
screen with these headings will be displayed: PRODUCT NAME, FORM TYPE, COPIES, SELECTED
PRINTER, BANNER, and PAGES. Below will be the print information for your selected file. If you want to use
the settings listed, press Transmit. If not, follow the steps below. When the settings are satisfactory, press
Transmit. To change the printer default setting, rather than the setting for a specific file, see paragraph 3.30,
Default:

3.14.1. COPIES. The cursor will be in the COPIES column. Although the system defaults to one copy, you can
increase the number, not to exceed 99, by typing the number desired over the number 1 in the COPIES column.

3.14.2. SELECTED PRINTER. To change the printer setting, use the Right Arrow to move to the SELECTED
PRINTER column where the default printer is displayed. To change the printer for that file only, two methods are
available. Use the Space Bar to toggle among the choices until you select the one you want and press Transmit.
As an alternative, press F4 in this column for a menu of available printers; highlight the one you want, using the
Up and Down Arrows; and press Transmit.

3.14.3. BANNER. To change the banner setting, use the Right Arrow to move to the BANNER column. The
system defaults to no banner (N). If the file will be printed in an area where identifying you as the owner may be
difficult, you may want to set the banner to print. If so, press the Space Bar to change the banner from N (no) to Y
(yes) and press Transmit.

3.14.4. PAGES. To select beginning and ending pages to be printed if you do not want the entire file, use the
Right Arrow to move to the PAGES column. To begin with a page other than 1, enter it in the first blank; move to
the second blank and enter the ending page number if other than the last page. To print all pages, make no entries
in this field.
3.15. Edit (Edit Marked Files). Use this to modify the text of files within Office Automation environments.
Mark the file you want to edit in the same manner as you would when using the VIEW command; you will then
enter a Prelude editor. The marked file will be displayed and you will be able to scroll through it and make
modifications. Remember that the function keys work differently in Prelude. Press F1 to save the changes and
return to the directory. If you decide not to save the changes, press F4 instead.

3.16. Move (Move Files between Directories). Use this to move all marked files to another directory that has
been created previously with the MKDIR command. Files can be moved up or down the directory structure which
can be multi-layered:

3.16.1. Non-SF/USAFE-52 Files. Highlight each file you want to move to another directory, press the Space Bar
to mark it, and press F10. Highlight Move at the menu bar and press Transmit. At the sub-menu of existing
directories, highlight the one to which you want the files moved and press Transmit.




AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5      1 March 1997                                                                     37

3.16.2. SF/USAFE-52 Files. Highlight the directory line (..) and press the Space Bar to mark it. Do the same for
each file you want to move to another directory and press F10. If you fail to select the .. directory, you will access
the SF-52 processing menu instead. Highlight MOVE at the menu bar and press Transmit. At the sub-menu of
directories, highlight the one to which you want the files moved and press Transmit.

3.17. Delete (Delete Marked Files). Use this to remove files when they are no longer needed. Highlight the files
to be deleted, press the Space Bar to mark each, press F10, select Delete, and press Transmit. Deleted files are sent
to the Trashcan, where after seven days they are automatically and permanently deleted. To delete Dir (directory)
files, you must use RMDIR (see paragraph 3.23). If you delete a file, you can recover it as long as you do it within
the 7-day time. To delete a file from the Trashcan immediately, highlight the file at the Trashcan directory, press
the Space Bar, press F10, high-light Delete, and press Transmit. You will receive the following warning: Files in
Trashcan will be deleted permanently. Do you wish to continue (y/n)? Press y to delete or n if you change your
mind and press Transmit. If you accidentally delete a file or later need it, use Undelete to retrieve it from the
Trashcan and return it to the active directory.

3.18. Undelete (Undelete Marked Files from a Trashcan). Use this to retrieve deleted files and restore them to
the current directory. At the directory, highlight Trashcan and press Transmit. NOTE: Do not mark them with
the Space Bar. All files in the Trashcan will be displayed. To recover a file, highlight it, press the Space Bar,
press F10, highlight UNDELETE, and press Transmit. The file will then be restored to the home (..) directory.

3.19. Sortdir (Sort the Current Directory Information). Use this to specify a sort that may be more convenient
for you. The home (..) directory always remains in the first place and is excluded from any sorting modifications
you make. Highlight SORTDIR at the menu bar and press Transmit. The sub-menu that follows has several
options, listed below. Highlight the option you want and press Transmit. What you select will be automatically
saved and will remain the sort until it is changed again:

3.19.1. Marked Files - First. Place one or more specific files at the beginning of the directory. You must first
mark the files with an X by pressing the Space Bar.

3.19.2. File Name - Alpha. Sort alphabetically by file name.

AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5     1 March 1997                                                                    39

3.25.7. Transmit (Send Email to Selected Addressees). Use this to forward the completed message; press
Transmit. A copy of the message will remain until you delete it. Messages addressed to offices will be sent to their
respective Email environments; messages addressed to individual users will be sent to their respective Prelude
environments.

3.25.8. Quit (Quit Menu Bar). Use this to escape the menu bar and return to the work screen.

3.26. Inturn (Create In-Turn Coordination). Use this to move a file from Production and Products to Incoming
Coordinations. Highlight the file you want, press the Space Bar to mark it, press F10, highlight INTURN, and
press Transmit. At the prompt, type in a title and press Transmit. At this point, follow the procedures for
Incoming Coordinations. You can build a route file and send the report to other offices for coordination. Each
recipient can edit the package with the Prelude editor. When a package arrives at the last address, the addressee
must do either a COMPLETE or a TERMINATE. After one of those actions is taken, the History addressee will
get a final copy of the package in the History area.

3.27. Upload (Kermit Transfer Marked File from PC to PC-III). Use this to bring files into PC-III so they can
be processed, coordinated, forwarded, etc., through the PC-III network. Some limitations exist. You can upload
only from a PC running MS-DOS and either the MPCVT or the PC3VT emulator and only files saved in an ASCII
format can be uploaded. Also, this process will not work from an AT&T 605 terminal; you must use a "smart"
terminal:

3.27.1. When selecting UPLOAD, follow these guidelines. You must know from which drive and directory the
file is to be uploaded. Make sure the terminal is reading from that drive and directory before initiating this
application. If needed, check the drive and directory by pressing Alt/D to toggle from PC-III to the "smart"
terminal. Use the DOS commands to change to the proper directory and drive. Then type "exit," press Return, and
the system will return to the point in PC-III from which it was toggled. Remember the exact name and extension
of the file to upload and, more importantly, ensure that it was saved in ASCII format. The file will be placed into
the current directory.

3.27.2. Enter the directory or sub-directory where you want the file to be uploaded. Press F10, highlight
UPLOAD, and press Transmit. At the prompt, type in the name and extension, if any, of the file to be uploaded
and press Transmit. A Kermit processing screen will appear while the file is being uploaded. The shorter the file,
the shorter the time the screen will be displayed. After the uploading process is complete, you must exit from the
directory and reenter it again to access the file.

3.28. Download (Kermit Transfer File from PC-III to PC). Use this to mark a PC-III file and download it to a
directory on your PC. Remember, this application will place the file into the current directory and drive:
3.28.1. Use Alt/D to toggle from PC-III to the "smart" terminal and change to the proper drive and directory into
which to place the selected file. Then type "exit" and press Return to return to PC-III. After the file is
downloaded, it will be available to you for use with DOS software. Highlight the file to be downloaded, press F10,
highlight DOWNLOAD, and press Transmit. A Kermit processing screen will appear while the file is being
downloaded. The shorter the file, the shorter the time the screen will be displayed. ASCII files retain the first
eight characters of their file names. PC-III products receive the name DOWNLOAD.XXX with the XXX
representing a 2- or 3-position alphanumeric extension. Although the screen may be visible for only a few
seconds, make note of the DEST: name given so that you can locate it later.

3.28.2. To access the file, return to the C: prompt of the directory or emulator you are in.

3.29. Boards (Read/Write/Delete/Append/View Prelude Clipboard Files). Use this to transfer files between
PC-III Office Automation environments and various Prelude environments. Some applications may require taking
a letter created in PC-III into the Prelude word processor to modify it:

3.29.1. Moving Files within Office Automation. To access Boards, the cursor must not be resting on the root
directory (..); it must be on a file. In this environment, Boards has five sub-options; explanations of how they work
follow:

40                                                                  AFMAN 36-2622         Volume 5     1 March 1997

3.29.1.1. Read a Clipboard. Files moved to a clipboard must be "read" to a permanent file before you can modify
them. Highlight the file to be read, press the Space Bar to mark it, press F10, select BOARDS, and press
Transmit. At the sub-menu, highlight READ A CLIPBOARD and press Transmit. At the sub-menu, highlight the
name of the clipboard and press Transmit. Type a file name to which the clipboard will be copied and press
Transmit. The clipboard will be copied to that file.

3.29.1.2. Write to a Clipboard. Use this to copy (write) a text file onto a clipboard, either an existing one or a new
one that you create. Highlight the file to be copied, press the Space Bar to mark it, press F10, select BOARDS, and
press Transmit. At the sub-menu, highlight WRITE TO A CLIPBOARD and press Transmit. At the sub-menu,
highlight either the name of an existing clipboard or <NEW BOARD> and press Transmit. If you select the latter,
type a name for the clipboard and press Transmit. NOTE: Do not use the name of an existing one unless you want
to replace the original file text. The new file text will overlay the old. The text will be copied into the clipboard.
To use this clipboard (view, edit, etc.), use the READ A CLIPBOARD option from any Office Automation
environment.

3.29.1.3. Delete a Clipboard. Use this to delete a clipboard that you no longer need. Highlight any file, press F10,
select BOARDS, and press Transmit. At the sub-menu, highlight DELETE A CLIPBOARD and press Transmit.
At the sub-menu, highlight the clipboard to be deleted and press Transmit. The clipboard will be deleted and
cannot be recovered.

3.29.1.4. Append to a Clipboard. Use this to add or append a text file to an existing clipboard. Highlight the file
to be added, press the Space Bar to mark it, press F10, select BOARDS, and press Transmit. At the sub-menu,
select APPEND TO A CLIPBOARD and press Transmit. Then highlight the name of the board to be added and
press Transmit. The text will be added to the selected clipboard at the end of the file already on it.

3.29.1.5. View a Clipboard. Use this to look at the text or contents of a clipboard. Highlight any file, press F10,
highlight BOARDS, and press Transmit. At the sub-menu, highlight VIEW A CLIPBOARD, and press Transmit.
Then highlight the clipboard you want to look at and press Transmit. After you have finished, press F3 to return to
the menu.

3.29.2. Moving Files from Office Automation to Prelude. Go into the Office Automation environment where the
file to move resides. Mark the file, press F10, select Boards, and press Transmit. Select WRITE TO A
CLIPBOARD and press Transmit. Select the name of the clipboard if it already exists and press Transmit. If not,
select <NEW BOARD> and press Transmit; then, enter the name of the new clipboard and press Transmit. The
board named now contains a copy of the file marked. To move files from Prelude to Office Automation, see
paragraph 3.6.
3.30. Default (Change Default Printer). Use this to change the printer default--the printer to which PC-III will
send your print requests unless you tell it to do otherwise. The default will remain so until you change it again.
Press F10, select Default, and press Transmit. The next screen will display your laser and line default settings.
Use the Up and Down Arrows, as needed, to shift between laser and line printer, depending on which one you want
to change. Use the Space Bar to toggle among the choices until you select the one you want and press Transmit.
As an alternative, press F4 on this line for a menu of available printers. Highlight the one you want, using the Up
and Down Arrows, and press Transmit. Transmit again to save the changes. A message, Default Printer Update
Status, with the new settings will be displayed. Press Return to continue.

3.31. Coord (Process Marked Coordination/History Files). Use this to coordinate on other than SF/USAFE-52
actions. The mechanics are similar to those of SF-52s, except that options are accessed from the F10 menu bar
rather than from a processing menu. Select COORD and a route file screen will be displayed. Press F10 for a
sub-menu which serves the same function as the ROUTE option for SF-52 applications. It includes these options:




AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5      1 March 1997                                                                      41

3.31.1. Save (Save Changes to the Coordination Route). Use this to save changes if you are not ready to move the
file.

3.31.2. Forward (Forward the Coordination to Next Future Addressee). Use this to move the file to the next office.
When you select FORWARD, changes you made to the text or route file will be saved automatically.

3.31.3. Complete (Complete the Coordination [at the History Addressee]). If you are in the last office to
coordinate on an action, use this to finalize it. Otherwise, do not use it as no further action can be taken after
COMPLETE is activated.

3.31.4. Terminate (Terminate the Coordination - Do Not Forward). Use this to cancel an action if it has been
submitted in error or if the originator decides to discontinue it. As with COMPLETE, no further action can be
taken after TERMINATE is activated.

3.31.5. Insert (Insert Addressees after the Address at the Cursor). Use this when building a route file. Be sure to
place the cursor in the correct position or the addressee you add may not be in the sequence you wanted.

3.31.6. Delete (Delete Address at the Cursor). Use this if an addressee was added in error or if it is no longer
necessary to send the action to that addressee. Be sure to place the cursor in the correct position or you will delete
the wrong addressee.

3.31.7. Reset (Reset to First Future Addressee). Use this to reset the status of addressees designated in the Type
column of the route file as Current or Delivered if an action must be returned to a previous reviewer or if it must be
pulled from History Coordinations and returned to Incoming Coordinations. Highlight the earliest addressee to
which the action must be returned, press F10, highlight RESET, and press Transmit. This is available only in
History Coordinations.

3.31.8. Convert (Convert File to Autos Format and Save in Production). This function is used exclusively by
Travel Pay at Accounting & Finance to format TDY orders and amendments for AUTOS processing.

3.31.9. Comment (Process the Coordination Comment Section). Select this and a sub-menu will be displayed; it
contains the following options:

3.31.9.1. View. Use this to review or look at the comments file for the coordination action. If it does not contain
any comments, a message will tell you so. You cannot make any changes to the file.
3.31.9.2. Print. Use this to print a copy of the comments file. See paragraph 3.14 for more information on
printing.

3.31.9.3. Add. Use this to create a comments file or to add comments to an existing one. Select ADD and you
will be taken into a Prelude editor to enter your comments. Remember that the function keys work differently in
Prelude. After you finish, press F1 to save the text and exit.

3.31.9.4. Agree. Use this to agree or concur with the comments file. Select AGREE and your concurrence will be
entered automatically.

3.31.9.5. Disagree. Use this to disagree or nonconcur with the comments file. Select DISAGREE and your
nonconcurrence will be entered automatically.

3.32. Process (Process). Use this to retransmit corrected BLPS rejects (paragraph 3.4). After making the
appropriate revisions to a reject, press F10 to access the menu bar, select PROCESS, and press Transmit. Use is
limited to work centers in the CPF. It is available only in Updates and Rejects.

3.33. Status (Status View of Marked Files). Use this to check the progress or determine the location of a
particular file in Incoming Coordinations and in History Coordinations. Highlight the file to check the status,
mark it, and press F10. Select STATUS and press Transmit. The STATUS option for SF/USAFE-52 actions can
be accessed from the SF-52 processing menu rather than from the menu bar.

3.34. Next (Change to Next Menu Bar). Since more commands exist than can be displayed simultaneously on
the menu bar, this command is available to let you access others. Highlight NEXT and press Transmit to view
subsequent menu items.

3.35. Quit (Quit Menu Bar). Use this to escape from the menu bar and return to the screen where you were
working. Highlight QUIT and press Transmit. This serves essentially the same function as pressing F3 or Esc at
the menu bar.

                                         CPF-UNIQUE APPLICATIONS

5.1. Introduction. The contents of this chapter include applications and aspects of applications to which only the
CPF has access. Information on other civilian applications common to the CPF, management, work centers, etc.,
is contained in other chapters throughout this manual. Chapter 11 contains customer service applications.

5.2. Processing the SF-52. When an SF-52 reaches the CPF, it may be sent to work centers for editing,
coordination, and processing. Following is a list of applications and the names by which they appear in Incoming
Coordinations: SF 52 CANCEL POSITION, SF 52 ESTABLISH IDENTICAL POSN, SF 52 FILL POSITION, SF
52 RESIGNATION, SF 52 NAME CHANGE, SF 52 RETIREMENT (VOL), SF 52 OTHER, and USAFE FORM
52. The options available will be determined by the menu which appears when you select a specific SF/USAFE-52
from OA Incoming Coordinations. Explanations of those options follow; not all of them are available for each type
of SF/USAFE-52. See figure 5.1.

5.2.1. View. Use this to display SF-52 screens only; you cannot make any changes to the request or coordinate on
the action.

5.2.2. Edit. Use this to change, add, or correct information on the SF-52 screens. Fields that can be edited are
highlighted as you move through the screens. To edit and coordinate for your functional area in the same process,
use the CPF OFFICE COORDINATION option, which lets you edit an action and automatically records your
review of the request in Part C--Reviews and Approval of the SF-52 (See paragraph 5.2.8.). That block is limited
to six reviewers. The Reviews and Approval used for Part C of the SF-52 cannot be edited in order to comply with
electronic authentication requirements. (This is the Work Center Final Reviews and Approval section on the
Internal CPF Coordination screen and the Approval Official/Approval Date on the SF-52 Approval screen.) If you
are not the final reviewer for your functional area, add your coordination to the Internal CPF Coordination section
to indicate your review. Coordinations made in this section will not appear on the SF-52.

5.2.3. Remarks. Use this to complete the SF-52, Part F, Remarks for SF-50. When you select it, a SELECT
ACTION screen will appear. Select ADD to add a remark code. Use the arrows or press the highlighted letter to
move to the desired code and press Transmit. If the remark code selected from the table requires data insertions,
screens will appear to allow for the literal entries. Do not use special characters in these fields. Select QUIT from
the remarks table when done and answer Y to save the remarks file. Select CHANGE when the data insertion
fields for a remark require changing, DELETE when deleting a remark code previously added, VIEW when
wanting to display the remarks, and QUIT when finished.

5.2.4. Process Personnel Transaction. After all editing is done, all reviews and regulatory and legal requirements
met, and the action approved and authorized, use this to format and flow the applicable PTI to DCPDS. At
present, only the ESTABLISH, CANCEL, and Promotion and Reassignment natures of action on a FILL generate
transactions to DCPDS.

5.2.4.1. When an SF-52 request is an ESTABLISH or a CANCEL, the system will generate a PTI 052, based on
the data entered. The request will flow automatically to DCPDS. The transaction, together with the DCPDS
response message, will be returned to OA Updates and Rejects for the user who transmitted the PROCESS
PERSONNEL TRANSACTION option.

5.2.4.2. When an SF-52 request is a FILL and the nature of action (NOA) is 702 (Promotion) or a 721
(Reassignment), this option will generate the PTI for flowing to DCPDS through PC-III. A series of screens
provides for entry of additional information before the PTI is formatted. See paragraph 5.3 for additional details.
The transaction, together with the DCPDS response message, will be returned to OA Updates and Rejects for the
user who transmitted the PROCESS PERSONNEL TRANSACTION option. Change of appointing office (PTI
CAO) and the other PTIs for a FILL are not available for processing through PC-III at the present time.

5.2.5. Retrieve Employee Information. Use this to retrieve the From information for the SF-52. The employee’s
record must reside on your core. On the first screen, enter the SSN of the selected employee. If the SSN is found,
AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5      1 March 1997                                                                      71

the employee data is entered into the From side of the SF-52 if you select SAVE EMPLOYEE DATA by entering a
1 and pressing Transmit. Use 2 to reenter another SSN if entered in error or not found, and use 3 to quit the
retrieval process without saving.

5.2.6. Retrieve Position Information. Reserved for future use.

5.2.7. Change Position Data (052). Reserved for future use.

5.2.8. CPF Office Coordination. Use this to electronically authenticate Part C, Block 1, Reviews and Approval, of
the SF-52. The process takes two steps. In step 1, you are shown the SF-52 request screens and may move through
them to view the data or edit it as necessary. When you finish, press Transmit. You will then be asked Are You
Ready to Coordinate (y/n)? If you are the reviewer for your functional area and have completed your work on the
action, enter y and press Transmit. If you are not the reviewer or if you have to make additional changes, enter n
and press Transmit. This area is limited to six office or function approvals. If you are not the final reviewer for
your functional area, record your coordination in the Internal CPF Coordination section. When you press Transmit
with y in the field, PC-III will electronically authenticate your action by placing the office/function, your login, and
the date in the Reviews and Approval field. The next time the SF-52 is viewed or edited, the reviewing/approving
official’s office or initials and the date will appear on the screen. NOTE: If you exceed the six areas and receive
the You have no more room for Coordination message, data entered during the session will be lost. In such cases,
use the EDIT option to reenter the data.

5.2.9. Approve the SF-52. If you have the authority to approve the SF-52 action, use this to authenticate Part C,
Block 2, Reviews and Approval, electronically. When you select this, the SF-52 screens are displayed for your
review and editing. When you finish, press Transmit. The following question will appear: Are You Ready to
Approve/Disapprove the SF52 (y/n)? If not, enter n and press Transmit to return to the menu. If so, enter y and
press Transmit. PC-III will electronically authenticate the signature for this block, based on your login and will
add the date, based on the current system date. An SF 52 Approval screen will be shown. Check either
APPROVAL or DISAPPROVAL, as appropriate, and add necessary comments. This is the only time you can edit
this screen. You must be logged in as the SF-52 Approval Authority to use this option. NOTE: To view remarks
before approving the SF-52, use the VIEW or REMARKS options.

5.2.10. Route. Use this to move the SF-52 from OA Incoming Coordinations. When you select ROUTE, a routing
selection window showing addressees in the current route file and their status under TYPE will be displayed. The
status actions displayed under TYPE will consist of Initiator, Delivered, Current, Future, and History. Users who
have already seen the package will be flagged as Delivered; the user who currently has the package will be flagged
as Current; users yet to receive the package will be flagged as Future; and the office that has the file copy of the
package will be flagged as History. To move the SF-52, press F10 or Transmit, and the top menu bar will be
displayed with the following options:

5.2.10.1. Save. Use this to save any changes you make to the route file for future use without moving the file
itself.

5.2.10.2. Forward. Use this to pass the file to the next addressee listed as Future in the Status window. Be sure
that a Future addressee is in the route file before you forward it. FORWARD automatically saves new changes
made to the route file.

5.2.10.3. Complete. Use this after all internal processing has been completed and the final SF-52 is printed.
COMPLETE removes permanently the electronic SF-52 from Incoming Coordinations and sends a final update to
the Status File. For some actions (CANCEL, ESTABLISH, and FILL/702/721), ensure that the transaction has
been processed and a confirmation received that the transaction successfully updated DCPDS before using this
update.

5.2.10.4. Terminate. Use this to cancel an action submitted in error, incorrectly authorized, or cancelled by the
submitter. No further action can be taken against the request after you TERMINATE. The Status File is updated
to reflect the action.
72                                                                  AFMAN 36-2622         Volume 5     1 March 1997

5.2.10.5. Insert. Use this to add any other addressees to the route file if requirements necessitate your doing so.
Before inserting an addressee, make sure that you highlight the line above the line where the new addressee is to be
added. All addressees must be inserted after the one labeled Current. When you have the proper line highlighted,
press Transmit. A submenu listing MPF/CPF, UNIT, GROUP and TABLE will be displayed. Select the
appropriate one, and another sub-menu will display the applicable units and offices. In the same manner, select
the appropriate one and press Transmit. Be sure to SAVE the changes if you are not ready to FORWARD the file;
selecting FORWARD saves automatically.

5.2.10.6. Delete. Use this to delete addressees labeled Future from the route file. Make sure the highlight bar is
on the address to be deleted before you press Transmit.

5.2.10.7. Comment. Use this to attach comments to the SF-52. Comments can be added at any time along the
way and stay with the package through completion. Select COMMENT and press Transmit to see the sub-options.
Use VIEW and PRINT to look at and print the comments file. Use ADD to create a comments file or to add
comments to an existing one; you will be taken into a Prelude editor to enter comments. If you agree/disagree,
select AGREE/DISAGREE and your choice will be entered automatically.

5.2.10.8. Reset. This is available in OA History Coordinations only. It allows the history addressee (CPF
Administration) to restart the SF-52. This is a means to recover an SF-52 which was "Completed" too soon,
"Terminated" in error, or lost in the routing process. Prior to using this option, place the cursor on the addressee
that needs to receive the SF-52 again. This will cause that addressee, as well as any addressees that follow, to
become Future addressees. Use the FORWARD option to route the SF-52 to the first Future addressee’s OA
Incoming Coordinations for subsequent processing.

5.2.11. Status. Use this to view any movement and action taken on the SF-52 up to the Current user. When you
FORWARD it, all addressees can track the movement through OA Coordination Status.

5.2.12. Print. Use this to print the SF-52 and a copy of the SF-52 clearance/comments screen, if applicable. The
SF-52 may be printed at any time. When printing the SF-52 for filing in the OPF, make sure the approving
authority has authenticated the action. Attach a copy of the clearance sheet and a copy of the completed status file.

5.2.13. Incorrect Menu. If you select an SF-52 for CPF processing and receive the management’s PROCESS SF52
menu (figure 5.2) rather than the CPF PROCESS SF52 menu (figure 5.1), check the request carefully. It may be
an SF-52 that has been generated within the CPF and is still being coordinated (as when a unit routes the action for
internal coordination before sending it to the CPF) or the submitting organization inadvertently forwarded the
request before electronically authenticating Part A, Block 6, Action Authorized By, of the SF-52. In the latter case,
ROUTE it back to the unit for authentication and subsequent return to the CPF for processing.

5.3. Processing Fill Personnel Transactions. The SF-52 must be completed in accordance with FPM
Supplement 296-33 before selecting this option.

5.3.1. CAO Processing. CAO processing is not available in PC-III at this time. If this is a CAO, press y to back
out of the routine.

5.3.2. Remarks Processing. To process remarks, you must indicate which ones are to be sent up with the
transaction. Move the cursor to the column to the left of the remark code and X the remarks to be sent. Any
insertion DINs (VAA through VFP) with an X will also go up in the transaction. Space out the X if necessary.

5.3.3. Optional Screen. This screen contains mandatory data entry items for the additional minimum "required"
DINs necessary for the transaction to process.

5.3.4. Additional Optional Screen. If other DINs are required, answer Y when prompted. An additional screen
will appear with fields for other optional DINs most frequently used.
AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5      1 March 1997                                                                     73

5.3.5. Additional DINs Needed. If you still need to input more DINs, answer Y when prompted, and an Optional
DIN Input screen will appear, where you input both the DIN and the data in a freestyle format. A period (.) must
follow the data input; continue with this process until all necessary DINs are input.

5.3.6. Updates and Rejects. Update confirmation and reject messages are returned to OA Updates and Rejects.
Limited edits are available within PC-III to check the action before it is transmitted. Since the action is retained in
OA Incoming Coordinations until completed, you can reprocess any rejected actions. As an alternative, you can
also reprocess an action by using the PROCESS option on the top menu bar in OA Updates and Rejects.
Remember to remove all extraneous lines leaving only the transaction before you press Transmit.

5.4. Physical Exam Update - CCPO (Application: phxudt):

5.4.1. Overview. This application lets you update the date and type of an employee’s last physical examination

it to fit. Remember, the first line cannot exceed 59 characters.

8.4.1.5.2. Save the message as an ASCII file. See your word processing documentation for procedures.

8.4.1.5.3. Use MS-DOS or your word processor to move the message into the same drive and directory that
contains your PC3VT (PC-III) emulator software.
8.4.1.5.4. Since the BBS cannot load a document directly from your PC, you must first upload it to OA Production
and Products and then import it into the BBS. To do so, follow these steps:

        •    Go into OA Production and Products. Press F10 to access the menu bar. Select FILES and press
             Transmit; then select UPLOAD FROM PC and press Transmit.

        •     Go into the BBS main menu, select IMPORT FILE FROM PRODUCTION AREA, press Transmit,
             and follow the procedures.

        •    If you have not already done so, select EDIT in the BBS to add a Subject line. Press Return to get a
             blank line and type in a subject. Remember to not exceed the 60th line or the 59th character on the
             first line.

8.4.1.5.5. You can also prepare a message by using Prelude, the word processing software that comes with PC-III.
To do this, save the Prelude message to the PC-III Board (clipboard), transfer it from the clipboard to OA
Production and Products, and go into the BBS and import it.

8.4.1.5.6. If you have a problem uploading from MS-DOS, your PC-III upload software (KERMIT) or the ASCII
SAVE option in your word processor may be set incorrectly. To check Kermit, sign on to PC-III, press Alt/F10,
select KERMIT from the top menu bar, highlight KERMIT-SETUP, and press Transmit. Make sure Kermit is set
to upload by using Kerm SVI procedures. If it is incorrect, type Kerm SVI over Kerm SVX save the setup. To
check your word processor, refer to your word processor documentation and insure it is not set to Save ASCII Files
with Tabs.

8.4.2. Delete Message:



100                                                                AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5      1 March 1997

8.4.2.1. To delete an item, highlight it on the message list of the menu and press Transmit. A message with the
subject line of the item to be deleted saying Are you sure you want to delete message #_? (y or n): will appear.
Type y to delete it or n to retain it and press Transmit.

8.4.2.2. To delete all items in the BBS from the endpoints, delete everything from BBS and Transmit the empty
BBS.

8.4.3. Transmit Updated BBS to Endpoints. BBS items can be sent through PC-III to all endpoints either as
RESTRICTED TO SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS or as AVAILABLE TO ALL EMPLOYEES. If a BBS file
is restricted, only managers and supervisors, as well as authorized user classes on PC-III (orderly rooms, CPF work
centers, unit civilian resource managers, etc.), can view the file through PC-III menus. If a BBS file is
unrestricted, the message will be available to users prior to the login prompt. Enter BBS and press Transmit to
view unrestricted messages:

8.4.3.1. If you select this, press Transmit and the following message will appear: Transmission successful. [Hit
return to continue].

8.4.3.2. Everything in the BBS goes as a package every time you press Transmit. Be aware that if you place
something in the BBS as a draft, someone else in the CPF could accidentally send the BBS to the network without
realizing that your draft went too.

8.4.3.3. You may view unrestricted messages by using a login or by signing on via the bbs pseudo login. You will
then be able to see unrestricted messages.

8.4.4. Recover Deleted BBS File. Be careful when you recover a previous version of the BBS. You recover the
whole BBS, not just selected files. It is possible to recover something that someone else wanted to stay deleted:
8.4.4.1. If you select this, press Transmit and you will receive this warning: The backup is from (time) on (date).
Do you really want to replace the bbs with the backup? (y or n).

8.4.4.2. If you select y (yes), press Transmit. The following message will appear: BBS successful recovered. [Hit
return to continue]. You will be returned to the BBS main menu.

8.4.4.3. If you select n (no), press Transmit. The following message will appear: Recovery aborted. [Hit return to
continue]. You will be returned to the BBS main menu.

8.4.4.4. Each time you do a recovery think about what version is out on the endpoints. If the current one is wrong,
quickly validate the version you recovered and get it transmitted to the endpoints.

8.4.5. Import File From Production Area:

8.4.5.1. If you select this, a Production Import menu listing files you can import will be displayed.

8.4.5.2. Highlight the file you want and press Transmit. A menu with the following options will appear:
RESTRICT TO THOSE PERSONNEL WITH LOGONS, AVAILABLE TO ALL PERSONNEL AND
INTERESTED MILITARY, and DELETE NEW MESSAGE, RESTORE OLD MESSAGE. Highlight the
appropriate one and press Transmit.

8.4.5.3. You will then be returned to the BBS main menu.

8.4.5.4. To view internally documented import help, press F1 at the Production Import menu.

8.5. Exiting the BBS. When you press Esc or F3 at the BBS main menu, the following message may be
displayed: The current bbs is newer than the version on the endpoints. Do you wish to transmit the new version?
(y or n):

AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5      1 March 1997                                                                    101

8.5.1. If you enter n (no), you will simply exit the BBS. Changes made during this session will not be sent to
endpoints.

8.5.2. If you enter y (yes), the following message should be displayed: Transmission successful. [Hit return to
continue]. Press Return, Esc, or F3 to exit.

8.6. Additional Help Information. Although there is a lengthy Help screen in the system (F2) on the BBS main
menu, some expert level concepts were omitted and are discussed below:

8.6.1. F4 gives you the ability to find a word from the location of the cursor to the end of the message. Pay
attention to the location of the cursor before you press F4; when you do, the cursor will jump to the top of the
screen.

8.6.2. Ctrl/R (^R) allows you to find and change text. It is much like doing a /Change to a DESIRE. As with F4,
it operates from the location of the cursor to the end of the message; pay attention to the location when you press
Ctrl/R.

8.6.3. Ctrl/K (^K) does a Clear to End of Line.

8.6.4. Ctrl/P (^P) allows you to take what was cleared with Ctrl/K and put it anywhere on the screen and repeat it
as many times as you want, saving time by duplicating without retyping.

8.6.5. Insert is always active when you create a message. If you back up on a line and type, everything to the right
of the cursor moves off the screen. As soon as you get to the end of the line or press Return, the text will reappear
at the beginning of the next line.
8.6.6. PgDn displays the bottom line of the previous page as the first line of the next page when you are in the
EDIT mode. This can help you keep track of where you are in the message.

8.6.7. F5 repaints the screen with the contents of memory and normally restores the keyboard if the cursor locks
up or you otherwise lose control of the screen. The system may lose track of what is displayed on the screen and
where versus what is actually stored in memory.

Section C--BBS Information for Supervisors, Managers, Etc.

8.7. Procedures. Select CIVILIAN BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM at the main menu and press Transmit. A
BBS main menu will give you the following options: LIST BBS MESSAGE FOR VIEWING, PRINT BBS
MESSAGE, and COPY/DOWNLOAD FILE TO PC:

8.7.1. List BBS Message for Viewing. Press Transmit and select the message you want to read, highlight it by
using the Up and Down Arrows, if necessary, and press Transmit. After you have finished, press Esc or F3 once to
return to the message list or twice to return to the BBS main menu.

8.7.2. Print BBS Message. If you have viewed a message you want to print, select this and press Transmit:

8.7.2.1. Select the message you want to print, highlight it by using the Up and Down Arrows, if necessary, and
press Transmit.

8.7.2.2. See paragraph 3.14 for procedures on printing files on a PC-III-connected printer. If you have a
companion printer and want an immediate copy, you may use Print Screen.

8.7.2.3. After you finish, press Esc or F3 once to return to the message list or twice to return to the BBS main
menu.

8.7.3. Copy/Download File to PC. To copy one or more of the BBS messages to a PC file, select this and press
Transmit.

8.7.3.1. Select either of the following options, using the Up and Down Arrows, if necessary:

8.7.3.1.1. Entire BBS File. Press Transmit. You will receive a message similar to the following: Download
successful, PC filename is [bbs_msg.???]. Go to MS-DOS, display all the file names that start with bbs_msg and
isolate the files full name. [Hit return to continue].

8.7.3.1.2. Individual Message. Press Transmit. At the display that appears, highlight the message you want
downloaded or copied and press Transmit. You will receive a message similar to this: Download successful, PC
filename is [bbs_msg.???]. Go to MS-DOS, display all the file names that start with bbs_msg and isolate the files
full name. [Hit return to continue].

8.7.3.2. If you press Return after completing either of the above two options, you will be back at the BBS main
menu.

8.8. Employee Access to BBS. To allow employees access to BBS, enter bbs at the login prompt on any terminal
connected to PC-III and press Return. Access through this channel does not let employees view messages intended
only for supervisors and managers.

8.9. Help Screens. While you are in the BBS menus, several Help screens are available for your use and
information. While you are viewing a Help screen, use F8 or PgDn to move forward through the pages and use F7
or PgUp to return to previous ones. Use F3 or Esc to leave a Help screen and return to where you were previously:

8.9.1. F1 gives you general information on several special keystroke options available both for managers and for
viewers.

8.9.2. F2 gives suggestions to new users for creating bulletin board items.
8.9.3. F4 gives you a list of related topics including standard key usage for the BBS and information on importing

                             INFORMATION RETRIEVALS/MANAGER PLUS

Section A--Introduction

9.1. General Information. Manager Plus is a single-user data base management software package. It was
designed to give you--as a commander, a manager, or a supervisor--the capability to format information retrieved
from PC-III into user-designed products. Although Manager Plus uses information provided by PC-III, it is not a
PC-III application, as such. If you are interested in Manager Plus but do not have the software, ask your GSA to
get it for you. To access this function, select INFO RETRIEVALS/MANAGER PLUS at the main PC-III menu
and press Transmit.

Section B--Information Retrieval (Application: portal)

9.2. Overview. The Information Retrieval system lets you create and maintain special products which include the
information you select according to the limits you place on the files to be screened. In effect, it serves as a
user-friendly method of creating the equivalent of DESIRE products without having to request them from the PSM
and wait until the following day to receive them. Information Retrieval is designed neither to replace the DESIRE
system nor to eliminate the role of the PSM in providing DESIRE service.

9.3. Operation. To access this application, select INFORMATION RETRIEVAL at the Info Retrievals/Manager
Plus menu and press Transmit. To begin with, a blank screen with a menu bar will be displayed. At that menu
bar, several functions are provided for your use: EDIT, NEW, LOAD, SAVE, DELETE, RUN, OPTIONS, and
QUIT. Each of these has a Help screen which you can access by pressing F1. Each F1 screen has a directory of all
the Help screens available, which you can view by pressing F10. Use F8 or PgDn to view subsequent pages and F7
or PgUp to return to previous ones. Each of these functions will be explained in more detail in paragraphs 9.4
through 9.11.

9.4. Edit. Select this if you want to create a new file or modify an existing one and press Transmit. While in this
function, you will need to define the data fields to display and search; set the search criteria; and define the search
type, logical operator, and sort option:

9.4.1. The first screen to be displayed will be Fields to Display Selected[0 ]. This is the first of many pages of
data identification numbers (DINs) and data names from which you can select from 1 through 255 for your file.
Notice the column to the far right, which contains the tables from which the DINs and data names came. While
you are working with civilian records, be sure to use DINs which apply to civilian records or which are common to
all records; for example, comall, civpos, comciv, cytbl, and civilian:

9.4.1.1. Use F8 or PgDn to page through the list of DINs and F7 or PgUp to return to previous pages.

9.4.1.2. You can use End to go to the end of the list and Home to return to the beginning.

9.4.1.3. Use the Up and Down Arrows to highlight each DIN you want. To select, press the Space Bar at the
highlighted DIN. If you change your mind about a DIN you have selected, return to it, highlight it, and press the
Space Bar again to deselect it.

9.4.1.4. Each time you select a consecutive number will be placed within the brackets to the right of the DIN and
the counter at the top of the screen will give you the same cumulative figure. You can monitor yourself so that you
do not exceed 255. The sequence in which you select DINs will be the sequence in which the information on your
product will be displayed.

9.4.1.5. After making all your selections, press Transmit.

9.4.2. The next screen similar to the previous one will also display a list of DINs, except that it will be Fields to
Search Selected[0 ]. You may place limits on your search, such as sex, pay plan, grade, latest appraisal rating,
etc., for a maximum of 10. This can help eliminate unwanted records:
104                                                                 AFMAN 36-2622 Volume 5 1 March 1997

9.4.2.1. Use F8 or PgDn to page through the list and F7 or PgUp to return to previous pages.

9.4.2.2. You can use End to go to the end of the list and Home to return to the beginning.

9.4.2.3. Use the Up and Down Arrows to highlight each DIN you want. To select, press the Space Bar at the
highlighted DIN. If you change your mind about a DIN you have selected, return to it, highlight it, and press the
Space Bar again to deselect it.

9.4.2.4. Each time you select, a consecutive number will be placed within the brackets to the right of the DIN, and
the counter at the top of the screen will give you the same cumulative figure. You can monitor yourself so as not to
exceed 10.

9.4.2.5. If you wish to select all records and place no restrictions on your selection:

9.4.2.5.1. Press Transmit at the first page of Fields to Search Select[0 ].

9.4.2.5.2. At the next screen, a highlighted bar labeled DEFAULT will be displayed. Press Transmit.

9.4.2.6. If you wish to place limitations on the records to be selected:

9.4.2.6.1. Select the limitations among the fields by highlighting each (up to 10) and pressing the Space Bar at
each. After you have made all your search selections, press Transmit.

9.4.2.6.2. The next screen will be labeled SEARCH PARAMETER ENTRY which will contain the parameters you
entered previously:
         •    At the Search Operator column, press F4 for a menu of choices. Use the Up and Down Arrows, if
              necessary, to select the one you want to use (see table 9.1 and notes for more information) and
              Transmit. Tab to the next column; use Shift/Tab if you need to return to the previous column.

         •    At the T (search type) column, press F4 for a menu of choices. Use the Up and Down Arrows, if
              necessary, to select the one you want to use (see table 9.2 for more information) and press Transmit.
              Tab to the next column; use Shift/Tab if you need to return to a previous column.

         •    At the Search Value column, type the values you want to use (see tables 9.1 and 9.2 for more
              information) and press Transmit.

9.4.2.6.3. The next screen is Select Sort Field which will list the DINs and data names you selected for display.
Using the Up and Down Arrows, if necessary, highlight the sort you want or the DEFAULT (random selection)
and press Transmit.

9.4.3. A screen telling you the number of lines per page, the DINs selected, the tables from which they were
selected, the search operator selected, and the sort will be displayed.

9.4.4. See paragraphs 9.6, 9.7, 9.9, and 9.10 below for more information on LOAD, SAVE, RUN, and OPTIONS,
respectively.

9.5. New. Select this to clear the current query setup from memory and work on something else. Press Transmit.
This does not delete or remove the current query from the library file as long as you remember to first save it (see
paragraph 9.7).

9.6. Load. Select this to load a pre-defined query into memory. When you press Transmit, you will be asked
Name of Local Query (F4=Prompt). Either enter the name of the query or press F4 for a list of current queries in
the library file, highlight the one you want, and press Transmit.

9.7. Save. Select this to save the current query setup or definition to the library file.
AFMAN 36-2622 Volume 5 1 March 1997                                                                                 105

9.7.1. When you press Transmit, you will be asked Name of Local Query (F4=Prompt). Either enter the name of
the query or press F4 for a list of current queries in the library file, highlight the one you want, and press Transmit.

9.7.2. If you type the name of an inquiry that already exists, you will receive the following warning: [file name]
already exists - overwrite it? Enter Y if you want to overwrite it or N if you do not and select a new file name.

9.8. Delete. Select this to delete a query. When you press Transmit, you will be asked Name of Local Query
(F4=Prompt). Either enter the name of the query or press F4 for a list of current queries in the library file,
highlight the one you want to delete, and press Transmit.

9.9. Run. Select this to execute the current query. When you press Transmit, select from the following options:

9.9.1. Run query and send output to screen. If you select this, enter the name of the file at the F4 prompt and
press Transmit. The following notice will be displayed: Running query...please wait. Your file will then be
displayed.

9.9.2. Run query and send output to file. If you select this, you will receive the following message: Enter name of
target file: Enter the file name and press Transmit. The following notice will be displayed: Running query...
please wait. The output will be sent to the specified file. It will be created in your OA Production and Products,
where you can then view, edit, or print it.

9.10. Options. Select this to perform special functions. Press Transmit and highlight the option you want to
select:
9.10.1. Lines per page. The default is 24. To change it, press Transmit and overtype 24 with the new number (at
least 4) and press Transmit again. If you set the lines per page at 0, Information Retrieval will not display or write
the page header.

9.10.2. Query type Local/Central. The default is LOCAL. Press Transmit to toggle from L (local) to C (central)
and vice versa.

9.10.2.1. Central contains pre-defined queries which you can edit but not delete. You can save modified Central
queries only to Local under new names.

9.10.2.2. Local contains queries defined at base or unit level which you can load, save, or delete.

9.10.3. Automatic data menus. The default is AUTOMATIC. You can enable or disable the automatic options
menu while setting search criteria. (You can do the same thing at the selection menu by pressing F4.) Press
Transmit to toggle from Y (yes) to N (no) and vice versa.

9.10.4. Manager Plus. Use this to tell the Information Retrieval function to reformat output file date to be
compatible with Manager Plus format. Press Transmit to toggle between Y (yes) and N (no). If you set Y and
select RUN from the main menu, you will be prompted to provide a file name. This will be the file where the
query output will be stored--in OA Production and Products.

NOTES:
1. LIKE allows comparison of characters or strings to a string value. It also allows ignoring single characters or
any number of characters through the use of wild card characters: _ to ignore a single character and % to ignore a
string of characters of any length (including zero). This is an IBM operator; it works pretty much the same as
SHLIKE (NOTE 2).


         Example: Select employees with names similar to Carr:

         bba LIKE C ’CAR|


Names selected might include Carr, Card, Carl, Cary, etc., which contain that exact number of letters and no more.


         Example: Select employees with names similar to Jones:

         bba LIKE C ’JO%’

Names selected might include Jones, Jonas, Johnson, Johnston, Johanssen, Jobes, Josephs, etc., which may have
more than one letter at the wild card position.

2. SHLIKE allows comparison of characters or strings to a string value. It also allows ignoring single characters
or any number of characters through the use of wild card characters: ? to ignore a single character and * to ignore
a string of characters of any length. This is an AT&T operator; it works pretty much the same as LIKE (NOTE 1).


       Example: Select employees with office symbols DPC?:

       bch SHLIKE C ’DPC?’




AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5      1 March 1997                                                                   109

Office symbols selected might include DPCG, DPCI, DPCM, etc., which contain that exact number of letters and
no more.


       Example: Select employees with Staffing in their duty
       titles:

       jbj SHLIKE C ’*STAFFING*’


Duty titles selected might include Staffing Specialist, Staffing Technician, Staffing Supervisor, Chief of Staffing,
etc., with more than one letter at the wild card positions.

3. REGLIKE allows comparison of a string of characters returned from a search condition by using a regular
expression. The pattern contains a string that you are comparing to the value of the selected field.


       Example: Select all employees whose names begin with the
       letters A through K.

       bba REGLIKE C ^[A-K]
4. IN allows comparison of a DIN to a set of values rather than to just one value. The search type must be set at N
(non-character). Each value for which you are searching must be within single quotes and the values must be
within parentheses.


       Example: Select all personnel with office symbols DPCID,
       DPCIM, and DPCIR.

                 bch IN N (’DPCID’,’DPCIM’,’DPCIR’


5. IS allows you to search fields that are null or have no value. The search type must be set at N (noncharacter).

       Example: Select all personnel with no duty phone:

                 bcg IS N (’ ’)

                                      PC-III SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION

14.1. Introduction. This chapter is intended for the civilian personnel system manager (CPSM); it covers only
those system administration applications unique to the civilian personnel environment. Refer to AFMAN 36-2622,
Volume 6, for other applications relating to PC-III system administration.

14.2. Refresh Management. The processes discussed below are vital to maintaining PEP databases and close
coordination between the GSA and the CPSM/ESA is essential. Fully automated processes are being developed
and they should be available in a future release:

14.2.1. Backup Civilian PEP DATABASE (Application: pepback). (ESA/CPSM) This application must be run
before the PC-III database is reinitialized or reconstructed in order to prevent permanent loss of PEP data.
Selecting this will start the backup process. The following message will be displayed: PEP BACKUP
STARTED -- Any further record updates will not be included in this backup. A summary of the backup will be put
in esa/Email as PEPBKUP.

14.2.2. Restore Civilian PEP DATABASE (Application: paprest). (ESA/CPSM) This application must be run
after the PC-III database reinitialization or reconstruction is complete in order to restore the previously backed up
data. Selecting this will start the restoration process. A warning that PEP records currently on the database may
be overlayed will be displayed. Then a message giving the label of the backup file to be overlaid will be displayed.

14.3. Table Management:

14.3.1. Create Auth Code Data Entry Menu (Application: cnv463). (CPSM) This creates a data entry table from
Central Table 463 (ORIG-APPT-AUTH-CODES) for use with SF-52 applications. The data table will display both
code and cleartext when the F4 prompt is activated. Whenever Central Table 463 is changed in a release or a
patch, this table must be refreshed to PC-III, and then through PC-III this application must be processed. When
you select this, a message saying that the data entry table has been built will appear.

14.3.2. Rebuild Remarks Data Entry Menu (Application: cnv036). (CPSM) This adds local remarks from Local
Table *11 (NONSTANDARD-SF-50-REMARKS) to the remarks data entry menus for use with SF52 applications.
124                                                          AFMAN 36-2622 Volume 5 1 March 1997

The data entry table will display local remarks at the end of the table after the standard ones. If you change Local
Table *11, that table (036) must be refreshed to PC-III; then through PC-III this application must be processed.
When you select this, messages saying that the data entry tables for SF-52 remarks have been updated will appear.

14.3.3. Update Remarks Data Entry Menus (Application: cnvrmk). (CPSM) This application is used to delete
remarks from the tables used to complete the SF-50 remark sections of SF-52 actions. This capability is necessary
in the event that OPM requires a new remark code or a code is missing from the table until a PC-III release
provides an updated table. You can also use this to view the contents of the two remark tables:

14.3.3.1. Select this and a screen allowing you to pick either table rmk000 or rmk700 will appear. Table rmk000,
a generic table, contains an extract of Central Table 12 remarks and Table rmk700 contains an extract of Central
Table 12 remarks pertaining to 7## natures of action (NOAs). If a new remark pertains to a 7## NOA, add it to
both tables; otherwise, add it to rmk000 only. Similarly, if an old remark pertained to a 7## NOA, remember to
delete it from both tables.
14.3.3.2. Enter the appropriate 6-position table number rmk000 or rmk700, and press Transmit.

14.3.3.3. The next menu will display the options available: VIEW, ADD, DELETE, and QUIT. ADDs and
DELETEs are saved to a temporary file until you quit. At that time, if you indicate that you want to save these
changes, the table is replaced.

14.3.3.4. View. Select this to view the entire table. The 4-character remarks with their cleartext definitions will
be displayed. You should use this after making changes to ensure they have been updated.

14.3.3.5. Add. Select this to access a data entry screen:

14.3.3.5.1. Enter the new 4-character code and corresponding cleartext and press Transmit. If you enter a code
resident on the table, it will reject.

14.3.3.5.2. You may also include insertion DINs. Instructions on how to enter them will be on the data entry
screen, so follow them closely.

14.3.3.5.3. When the update is complete, a message indicating that the remark has been added will appear.

14.3.3.5.4. Press F3 and the message Are there more remarks to be added? (y/n) will appear. Use y to continue or
n if finished and press Transmit.

14.3.3.5.5. Select Quit and the message Do you wish to save the new remarks table? (y/n) will appear. Enter y and
press Transmit. A message saying that the new table has been saved will appear.

14.3.3.6. Delete. Select this to access a data entry screen. Be sure you do not delete any valid OPM remarks from
the table:

14.3.3.6.1. Enter the 4-character code to be deleted and press Transmit. When the update is complete, a message
indicating that the remark has been deleted will appear.

14.3.3.6.2. Press F3 and Quit. The message Do you wish to save the new remarks table? (y/n) will appear. Enter
y and press Transmit. The message New data entry table for remarks has been saved will appear.

14.3.3.7. Quit. If you use F3 or Esc to exit immediately after an update, the warning EXITING WITHOUT A
SAVE will appear. Use QUIT instead and you will be asked Do you wish to save the new remarks table? (y/n).
Choose your response and press Transmit.

14.4. CCPO Restructuring Program. These applications are to be accomplished when a CCPO-ID change
occurs; they require close coordination between the GSA and the CPSM:

AFMAN 36-2622        Volume 5     1 March 1997                                                                    125

14.4.1. Add New CCPO-ID PAS Codes-lm025 (Application: ccpoadd). (ESA) Select this to add new CCPO-IDs
(first two characters of a PAS) to the local table. Run this application on every EP that services civilians whose
CCPO-ID has changed:

14.4.1.1. Add New PAS. To add a new PAS and update the local table, enter the first two characters of the old
(existing) PAS and of the new one and press Transmit. Select QUIT and the program will update the compiled
local tables. It may take a few seconds before you are returned to the previous menu.

14.4.1.2. View Table lm025. Table lm025 is available here to review before making updates and to verify that
entered changes have been updated.

14.4.2. Chg Gp/Wkcntr Tbl for CCPO Chgs (Application: ccpochg). (ESA) Select this to modify this table to
allow database access for civilian and military records. This application is in a Prelude editor which will let you
change database access checks where a line entry exceeds 80 characters. The editor will wrap lines exceeding 80
characters but will display only 80 at a time. Run this application on every EP that services civilians whose
CCPO-ID has changed:

14.4.2.1. In most cases, the database access check is based on the PAS-Admin or PAS. If the check is against all
eight positions of a code when a civilian PAS is changed, the entry must be changed to check only the last three or
four positions to give units or work centers access to civilian records.

14.4.2.2. If the database access check within the group/work center tables is based on the last three or four
positions of a PAS-Admin or PAS, no change is required.

14.4.2.3. Below is an example of old and new work center tables/files. NOTE: The pipe symbol is represented by


         Old: /usrb/pc3/system/data/Offices/wkcntr.ls.y
         B0000000000|347th Supply Sq|RJ0JFCKS|unit|B*|bc6 = ’RJ0JFCKS’||
         BA000000000|Supply Distribution|RJ0JFCKS|wkcntr|BA*|bc6 =
         RRJ0JFCKS’ and aaj shlike ’MEM*’||


         New: /usrb/pc3/system/data/Offices/wkcntr.ls.y
         B0000000000|347th Supply Sq|RJ0JFCKS|unit|B*|bc6 shlike ’*CKS’|||
         BA000000000|Supply Distribution|RJ0JFCKS|wkcntr|BA*|bc6 shlike
         ’*CKS’ and aaj shlike ’MEM*’||


14.4.3. Add/Chg CCPO-ID For .login File (Application: ccpoid). (ESA) Select this to modify this file for each
office to ensure coordination packages can be sent to the correct CPF. Enter the first two characters of the new
PAS and of the old (existing) one and press Transmit. A new entry will be added to the .login file for each office
on that EP. Run this application on every EP that services civilians whose CCPO-ID has changed.

14.4.4. Chg CCPO-ID for O/A Addr Table (Application: ccpogw). (GSA only) Select this to change Email
address tables to indicate the new CCPO-ID. This table is used to route E-Mail and SF-52s among offices, units,
and work centers:

14.4.4.1. Enter the old and new CCPO-IDs. If the GW supports more than one CPF, this will allow for more than
one CCPO-ID change. If changing more than one, repeat the process of entering old and new CCPO-IDs. The
local.tbl located in the /usrg/pc3/oa/data/Addr directory will be changed.

14.4.4.2. After making all the necessary changes go to MAILMAN UTILITIES, CONFIGURATION, OFFICE
AUTOMATION ADDRESS MAINTENANCE, to view the CPF offices to ensure that all changes have been made.
After viewing them, press Transmit to send the new address table (local.tbl) to all EPs.

126                                                                 AFMAN 36-2622         Volume 5     1 March 1997

14.4.5. Add CCPO-ID to Mailman Prgms (Application: chccpo). (GSA) Select this so that the table will allow
ICI/EOD refresh programs to recognize the new CCPO-ID. Sign on to the GW as GSA. After selecting this, you
will receive a message stating that this change will take about 10 minutes to run. After it has finished, rebuild the
new tables and distribute them to all EPs. To do so, select Mailman Utilities, Configuration, and follow the

Terms

ACCELL--An information retrieval system within PC-III which provides on-screen responses to certain
applications. Key functions differ significantly from those used in standard PC-III applications.

Access--The capability to view and manipulate information stored in a computer system.

Application--(DOD) 1. The system or problem to which a computer is applied. Reference is ofter made to an
application as being either of the computational type, wherein arithmetic computations predominate, or of the data
processing type, ;wherein data handling operations predominate. 2. In the intelligence context, the direct
extraction and tailoring of information from an existing foundation of intelligence and near real time reporting. It
is focused on and meets specific, narrow requirements, normally on demand. (JP 1-02)

Enter/Return--A key normally used within the PC-III environment to move from data field to data field or to move
from page to page. Its functions are different from those of the Transmit key. In other environments, it is used to
load, send, or save information. Normally, it is located between the alphabetic and numeric keyboards.

Files--Products (for example, reports, personnel actions, messages, RIPs) contained in one of the directories found
in the Office Automation area.

Gateway--The center of all PC-III activity on the base. It is a communications processor that provides software
interface among its EPs, Phase IV, HAF, and other DDN host computers.

Information Retrieval--A user-friendly system designed to give commanders, managers, and supervisors the
ability to prepare the equivalent of DESIRE products and receive immediate responses rather than overnight
responses.

130               AFMAN 36-2622                          Volume 5                 Attachment 1         1 March 1997

Kermit--Software imbedded in PC-III which is used to upload and download files from other systems into PC-III.

Login--The first item needed to access PC-III. It consists of the first letter of a user’s first name and as many as
seven letters of the last name (Example: David Robertson would be assigned a login of droberts). For security
reasons, a login is assigned to all actions an individual takes in PC-III. They are not given to every person on the
base. Each organization’s commander selects who has access to PC-III.

Menu--Main menu: The first screen after accessing PC-III. It allows selection of functions from the titles listed.
Sub menu: Other menus below the main menu which are layered from broad, general topics to specific topics.
The layering makes it easier to determine where a user is within the system.
Office Automation--The environment within PC-III for sending mail. Major areas: Production and Products,
Prelude, Electronic Office Mail, Incoming Coordinations, Coordination Owner’s Copies, Unfinished Remote
Applications, and Rejects and Updates. Employees who are not supervisors do not have access to Office
Automation.

Password--(DOD, NATO) A secret word or distinctive sound used to reply to a challenge. See also challenger;
countersign; reply. (JP 1-02)

Prelude--Software incorporated into PC-III used for office automation functions such as word processing and
private mail.

Printer--Companion or PcPrint printers attached to Z-248s, Wangs, or other terminals can be used to print the
contents of screens with the Print Screen function. Laser printers that are used exclusively for PC-III are letter
quality printers attached to EPs; they can be used to produce such forms as SF-52, SF-172, and DD-1556. Draft,
endpoint, or line printers that are used exclusively for PC-III are dot matrix printers attached to EPs; they can be
used to print reports.

Report--A product that supervisors and managers can generate through PC-III. Since PC-III reports run in the
background, terminal access is still available while the computer is collecting data. When a report is completed, it
is sent to Office Automation, Production and Products.

Syntax--Rules governing the structure of a language.

Terminal--The device used to communicate with endpoints. Intelligent (smart) terminals include Zenith 248,
Unisys, Wang, Sperry PC, etc. PC-III-supplied (dumb) terminals include AT&T 605 and AT&T 700. Dumb
terminals cannot extract information from PC-III and put it onto a disk.

Transmit--A key which functions within the PC-III environment to load, send, or save information. It is different
from the Enter/Return key. Normally, it is located on the far right side of the keyboard and may be labeled with a
plus (+) sign.

User--Any person who interacts directly with a computer system.
