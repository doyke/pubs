This checklist establishes procedures for employing the Modular Airborne Fire
Fighting System (MAFFS) on C-130J aircraft employed by Mobility Air Forces
(MAF) to accomplish their worldwide mission. This checklist complements AFI 11-
2C-130J-V3, Operations Procedures, and is printed on standard 8 ½” x 11” bond
paper, and trimmed to fit the standard plastic aircrew checklist binders. This
checklist is intended to provide MAFFS certified crewmembers quick reference to
procedures required for the safe execution of MAFFS ground and flight operations.
All MAFFS certified C-130J loadmasters will carry this annex.
Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change

         C-130J MAFFS OPERATIONS
         LOADMASTER CHECKLIST

   MAFFS CHECKLIST PROCEDURES: Items on the
   MAFFS BEFORE TAKEOFF, AFTER TAKEOFF, BEFORE
   LANDING, and AFTER LANDING CHECKLISTS will be
   accomplished following completion of the normal checklist
   items from T.O. 1C-130J-1CL-2. The CL-2 checklists will not
   be called complete for MAFFS missions until items of the
   MAFFS checklist are accomplished. The loadmaster will
   verbalize the setting of the Compressor Enable Switch and the
   pressure of the MAFFS hydraulic system when calling the CL-
   2 Before Takeoff checklist complete. As always, the checklists
   and these instructions are not substitutes for sound judgment
   and special circumstances may require modifications of these
   procedures.


     PART ONE – NORMAL PROCEDURES

                              CAUTION
       Do not operate the MAFFS compressors if use of
       propeller de-icing is expected. Operation of the MAFFS
       compressors in icing conditions may exceed maximum
       generator loads. If icing conditions are anticipated,
       ensure Compressor Enable switch is in the OFF
       position. The loadmaster will obtain a verbal
       confirmation from the pilot prior to enabling
       compressors.

                     EMERGENCY DROP


1. Emergency Drop – “CLEARED TO DROP”                            (P)
2. EMERGENCY DROP SWITCH – Lift Guard and Toggle
                                                         (LM) (CP)
                              WARNING
      If nozzle fails to open after both the pilot and
      loadmaster select E-Dump, move the NOZZLE switch
      on the cabin control unit to OPEN.


                              WARNING
      If the system is in the armed state, the system must be
      disarmed prior to moving the NOZZLE switch on the
      cabin control unit to OPEN.

 To stop both compressors and all hydraulic pumps from the MAFFS
 loadmaster station:

1. Power Switch – GROUND MODE
2. EMER STOP (FWD Pallet) – IN
3. 28 VDC Power Switch (FWD Pallet) – DISABLE

 If conditions dictate complete removal of power to the MAFFS unit:

4. Generators 1 and 4 – “OFF”                                    (PM)
5. TR 2 Circuit Breaker – “PULLED”                                (P)
6. TR 4 Circuit Breaker – “PULLED”                               (CP)
 When conditions permit:
7. MAFFS Power Cables – “REMOVED”                                (LM)
8. TR 4 Circuit Breaker – “RESET”                                (CP)
9. TR 2 Circuit Breaker – “RESET”                                 (P)
10. Generators 1 and 4 – “ON”                                    (PM)
                              WARNING
       Once the MAFFS unit power cables are disconnected
       from the aircraft, pulling the MAFFS battery circuit
       breaker will remove all power from the MAFFS unit
       including power required for an emergency dump.
       Pulling this circuit breaker is only recommended if you
       have already dropped and the MAFFS DC system is
       suspected of causing smoke or fire.


11. MAFFS Battery Circuit Breaker – “PULLED” (if required) (LM)
12. EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN CHECKS – “COMPLETE”
                                        (LM, PM)
