SUMMARY OF CHANGES

1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground
work for reporting the status of aircraft. They list the minimum essential systems and subsystems
that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime, training, test or
other missions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness Status of Resources and
Training Systems (SORTS) reporting only and denotes Mission Capable (MC) aircraft capable of
being configured for a contingency mission in accordance with COMACC OMNIBUS Plan.

1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft expectations and help explain complex degraded
mission systems such as suspension equipment.
1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC. A
Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can be
configured and generated to Mission Ready Available (MRA) status at an employment site.
1.3.All ANG units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ANG MESLs. Major Command
(MAJCOM) differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another
MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify the unit’s
requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
1.4.Reading the MESL.A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work unit code
(WUC) against the Fully Mission Capable (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems Lists (BSLs)
across the page. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines
applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ANG assigned aircraft; and
therefore, it is important to compare only those columns listed in the MESL which are applicable
to the unit's assigned aircraft. For example, units with CC (combat) coded aircraft would
determine and report status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to their DOC statement.
Units with TF (training) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and
TNG columns , and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would determine and report status using
only the FSL and TST columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is reported
using the MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code.
