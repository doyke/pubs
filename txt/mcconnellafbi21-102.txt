     (22 MXG) and 931 Deputy Commander for Maintenance (931 ARG/DCM) Quality
     Assurance (QA) office.
     1.2. The wing FOD monitor is responsible for scheduling and briefing quarterly FOD
     meetings.
     1.3. All personnel are responsible for reporting potential FOD conditions or problems
     existing on the flight line, within maintenance hangars and all maintenance industrial areas to
     the wing FOD monitor.
     1.4. Potential airfield FOD conditions should be reported to the airfield manager through the
     Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), base ops or command post immediately.
        1.4.1. Airfield manager will back-brief the wing FOD monitor on follow-up actions
        taken on reported potential FOD.
     1.5. Squadron(s)/unit(s) engaged in flight line/airfield activities must:
        1.5.1. Provide the wing FOD monitor with FOD monitor appointment letters and update

2. PROCEDURES:
     2.1. Vehicle operators are required to perform vehicle FO inspections before entering the
     MAPA. This inspection includes a circumferential tire check (roll-over check) and a general
     vehicle walk around to inspect wheel wells and bumpers. The inspection will include
     removal of any FO from tire treads. Mandatory tire roll over checks will be accomplished
     before entering the Ops Ramp in front of building 1110 and when entering at the Kansas
     Street gate near the Fire Department. Tire roll over checks will be accomplished at all entry
     points into Delta Ramp (see attachment 5).
        2.1.1. Emergency and alert response vehicles are exempt from this policy when
        responding to actual emergencies or alert quick-reaction responses, simulated or real-
        world. Operators of these vehicles will notify airfield management as soon as practical
        and airfield management personnel will perform a FOD check to ensure the route is FOD
        free.
     2.2. Vehicle operators who identify foreign objects in their path will take all possible actions
     to stop and correct the foreign object condition. When unable to do so, contact airfield

     4.1.1. Ensure work areas are free of foreign objects and account for all tools and
     equipment prior to breaks in maintenance and/or when their maintenance action is
     complete. Foreign objects will be placed in containers and receptacle(s) (i.e. FOD bags,
     FOD cans, Buckets, etc.) while maintenance action is in progress. Ensure these containers
     are properly emptied after maintenance is complete and the end of the duty day.
     4.1.2. Properly store all hardware when working on the aircraft. Small parts and
     hardware removed from the aircraft will be placed in parts bags and attached to panels or
     components during breaks in maintenance. Parts bags will be labeled to identify the
     type/quantity of hardware and associated aircraft tail number/equipment identification
     information. All personnel will ensure their work area is free of FOD after performing
     maintenance.

           4.2.1.2. Restricted Area Badges will be secured to the person or uniform. Each
           individual is responsible for properly displaying and securing their RAB.
           4.2.1.3. Methods to secure RABs include a subdued nylon/cotton cord if worn
           around the neck or armband type holder for display on upper arm. When worn around
           neck the cord must be a break-away style for safety concerns. When secured to the
           uniform with only a clip, a secondary attachment point must be used – i.e.,
           nylon/cotton cord.
5. FOD WALK PROCEDURES:
    5.1. Foreign object debris in the maintenance complex and on the flight line is everyone’s
    responsibility. These guidelines provide a basic framework for keeping areas foreign object
    free.
    5.2. Building occupants are responsible for the immediate areas around their buildings,
    including smoking and trash collection areas. This includes identifying FOD hazards such as
    broken concrete and degrading asphalt. Units will contact appropriate agencies to correct

       5.4.2. FOD Boss and FOD Magnet will be used by AMXS and MXS in addition to FOD
       walks to prevent FOD. AMXS will operate the FOD Boss and Magnet on the MAPA at
       least 12 hours each month. MXS will operate the FOD Boss and Magnet in aircraft
       towing areas (throats to the MAPA and outside hangars) and around their areas of
       responsibility at least 6 hours each month.
       5.4.3. Production Supers or an NCOIC will organize and execute the FOD walk. They
       will notify the QA office upon completion of the weekly FOD walk.
       5.4.4. Perform pre and post use FOD walks of Delta, Echo and Fox ramps.
MCCONNELLAFBI21-102 17 JULY 2012                                                              5

  representatives from all base agencies. Particular attention of this FOD Walk will be to clean
  up accumulated debris from grassy and unused areas of the airfield.
6. 22 ARW MAINTENANCE BIRD STRIKE REPORTING PROCEDURES:
  6.1. All units will report bird strikes using their supervisory channels and procedures.
  6.2. All ground-found and aircrew reported bird strikes (damage or no damage) will be
