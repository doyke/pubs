                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Overview. All evaluations will be conducted IAW the provisions of AFI 11-202V2,
Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, and this instruction. Information gathering
documents will be established as forms in accordance with AFI 33-360.
     1.1.1. Cockpit Resource Management (CRM) skills will be evaluated along with technical
     skills as outlined in the Pilot grading criteria in this chapter. CRM skills are imbedded within
     the appropriate grading criteria; the use of AF FORM 4031 is not required.
1.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
     1.2.1. AF/A3/5: is approval authority for changes/revisions to this instruction.
     1.2.2. AF/A3O: is the waiver authority for this instruction. Waivers will be requested from
     the MAJCOM Stan/Eval through appropriate channels.
     1.2.3. MAJCOM A3: is the waiver authority for individual aircrew requirements, IAW AFI
     11-202V2.
1.3. General Procedures. (T-2).
     1.3.1. Flight Examiners (FEs) will use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 3 for all
     flight and emergency procedure evaluations. FEs will be thoroughly familiar with the
     prescribed evaluation criteria.
     1.3.2. Recording devices (Digital Video Airborne Data Recorder (DVADR), tape recorders,
     Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI), etc.) should be used, when available, to
     reconstruct/evaluate the mission.
     1.3.3. The FE may fly in any flight position (to include chase) to conduct a thorough
     evaluation.
     1.3.4. The FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be
     conducted. Prior to flight, the examinee will accomplish required flight planning in
     accordance with the flight position assigned during the evaluation. Higher Headquarters
     (HHQ) FEs (and unit FEs as determined locally) will be furnished a copy of necessary
     mission data and mission materials.
     1.3.5. Areas indicated with an "R" are required items for that evaluation. A required area is
     a specific area that must be evaluated to complete the evaluation. All required areas must be
     included in the evaluation profile, except as noted in the table. Required areas are shown in
     Table 2.1 and Table 2.2 When it is impossible to evaluate a required area in flight, it will be
     evaluated by an alternate method (i.e., in an aircrew training device (ATD) or cockpit
     procedure trainer (CPT) or by oral examination) in order to complete the evaluation. The
     reason why required area(s) were not evaluated inflight and the alternate method of
     evaluation used will be documented in the Additional Comments portion of the AF FORM 8,
     Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
AFI11-2A-10CV2 30 JUNE 2014                                                                       5


     1.3.6. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. At a minimum, this debrief
     will include the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other
     than qualified) and any required additional training.
1.4. Grading Instructions. (T-2) Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI
11-202V2 and this instruction. The appropriate ACFT designation that should be placed in
section I of the Certificate of Aircrew Qualification is “A-10” (further delineation of A-10C is
also acceptable).
     1.4.1. The FE will base tolerances for inflight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a
     stable aircraft. The FE will not consider momentary deviations from tolerances; provided the
     examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying
     safety. The FE will consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
     1.4.2. When grading criteria specify that airspeed/Angle of Attack (AOA) be evaluated and
     the flight manual lists only a minimum/maximum/recommended airspeed/AOA for that area,
     the examinee will brief the desired airspeed/AOA.
     1.4.3. The FE will compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during the
     evaluation with the standards provided in this instruction and assign an appropriate grade for
     the area. The FE will derive the overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on
     a composite for the observed events and tasks IAW this instruction.
        1.4.3.1. FEs will use the grading criteria in this instruction to determine individual area
        grades. FE judgment must be exercised when the wording of areas is subjective and when
        specific situations are not covered.
        1.4.3.2. If the examinee receives an area grade of "U" in any of the critical areas
        identified by this instruction, an overall grade of "Unqualified" will be assigned.
        Unsatisfactory performance in any critical area or critical subarea will result in
        qualification level of "Q-3."
        1.4.3.3. FE judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.
        1.4.3.4. The following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except as noted
        for specific events and instrument final approaches:

Table 1.1. General Criteria.

Q         Altitude         +/- 200 feet

          Airspeed         +/- 5%

          Course           +/- 5 degrees/3 NM (whichever is greater)

          TACAN Arc        +/- 2 NM

Q-        Altitude         +/- 300 feet

          Airspeed         +/- 10%
 6                                                               AFI11-2A-10CV2 30 JUNE 2014


          Course           +/- 10 degrees/5 NM (whichever is greater)

          TACAN Arc        +/- 3 NM

U                          Exceeded Q- limits

1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). (T-2) If available and configured
appropriately, ATD will be used to conduct the requisite EPE. If an ATD is not used, the EPE
will be conducted in an appropriate unit training device (UTD), FMT, or CPT, in order of
preference. If unable to use a CPT, the EPE will be given orally. This evaluation will include
areas commensurate with examinee’s ready aircrew program (RAP) training level. Table 2.2
lists standardized EPE grading areas.
     1.5.1. The following items will be included on all emergency procedures evaluations:
     1.5.1.1. Aircraft General Knowledge.
        1.5.1.2. A minimum of two emergency procedures per phase of flight (i.e., pre-takeoff,
        takeoff, cruise and landing), and include all Bold Face procedures.
        1.5.1.3. Flight Coordination (if applicable).
        1.5.1.4. Unusual attitude recoveries will be evaluated during all EPEs. This fulfills the
        Area 15, Unusual Attitude Recoveries, requirement for Pilot Instrument/Qualification
        evaluations.
     1.5.2. The following additional items will be included on EPEs as a requisite for the
     instrument and/or qualification evaluation:
        1.5.2.1. AFMAN 11-217, Vol             1,   Instrument   Procedures.    Evaluate    use   of
        standby/emergency instruments.
        1.5.2.2. Alternate/Divert Airfields. If possible, evaluate a minimum of one approach at
        other than home base.
     1.5.3. Mission evaluation scenarios should be tailored to unit tasking. The following
     additional items should be included on the emergency procedures evaluation given as a
     requisite to the mission evaluation:
        1.5.3.1. Weapons system operation.
        1.5.3.2. Electronic Attack (EA)/Electronic Protection (EP)/Radar Warning Receiver
        (RWR).
        1.5.3.3. Evasive action.
        1.5.3.4. Weapons delivery and switchology.
     1.5.4. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised status
     until recommended additional training is completed and or a reevaluation is successfully
     accomplished. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade because of an unsatisfactory
     Bold Face Emergency accomplishment will not be permitted to fly in their aircrew position
     until a successful reevaluation is accomplished. For qualified pilots that require an additional
     training EPE(s), the FE will indicate if the additional training will be accomplished before
AFI11-2A-10CV2 30 JUNE 2014                                                                     7


   the flight evaluation. Additional training and reevaluations will be accomplished IAW AFI
   11-202, Vol 2.
   1.5.5. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs:
        1.5.5.1. Q. Performance is correct. Quickly recognizes and corrects errors.
        1.5.5.2. Q-. Performance is safe, but indicates limited proficiency. Makes errors of
        omission or commission.
        1.5.5.3. U. Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability.
1.6. Documentation of Weapons Employment Results. (T-2) Weapons employment results
will be documented in the Mission Description Section of the AF FORM 8 for mission
evaluations.
   1.6.1. Air-to-Surface. Hit or Miss IAW AFI 11-2A-10V1, A-10 Aircrew Training, will be
   entered for each air-to-surface record delivery. For air scored event or for VTR assessed
   deliveries, FEs will determine weapons employment results. Air scored or VTR assessed
   deliveries will be annotated with an asterisk (or asterisks as required). Document results
   using "Hit/Miss" as in the following example:
        1.6.1.1. Weapons delivery scores were:
           1.6.1.1.1. LALD VLD LAHD
           1.6.1.1.2. Hit*    Hit** Hit/Miss
           1.6.1.1.3. *VTR assessed / **Air Scored
   1.6.2. Forward Air Control (FAC) Target Marks. For the purpose of FAC target mark,
   marks will be scored as a hit or a miss by the FE in either FAC or fighter aircraft. Marks will
   be scored as a "Hit" if they are considered usable for marking the designated target, delivered
   in a timely manner and delivery used is tactically sound. They will be scored as a "Miss" if
   they are unusable for target marking, untimely or the deliveries are tactically unsound (i.e.,
   excessive altitude loss, unnecessary exposure to the threat, excessive track time, etc.).
   Document results as in the following example:
        1.6.2.1. Weapons delivery scores were:
           1.6.2.1.1. TAC RX
           1.6.2.1.2. Hit/Hit/Hit/Miss
   1.6.3. Air-to-Air. Record the number of simulated missile/gun firing attempts and the
   number that were valid as in the following example (if applicable):

Table 1.2. Air-to Air.
                    ATTEMPTED                     VALID
AIM-9               2                               1
   1.6.4. FE Judgment. FE judgment will be the determining factor in deciding the weapons
   employment grade. If the examinee fails to qualify in any event(s), the FE may elect to award
   a higher area grade than warranted by the score(s). The FE will include justification for such

                                           Chapter 2

                             EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General. (T-2).
   2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202, Vol 2, Chapter 4. The
   procedures and flight profiles outlined in this chapter apply to all A-10 units. For all
   evaluations including initial, the AF FORM 8 will be annotated with A-10 (further
   delineation of A-10C is also acceptable) in the ACFT/CREW position. Evaluation
   requirements are depicted in Table 2.1 With the approval of the Operations Group
   Commander, the Instrument/Qualification Evaluation (2.2) and the Mission Evaluation (2.3)
   may be combined as a single evaluation. Unit Commanders, with coordination through the
   unit Chief of Stan/Eval may designate experienced pilots for this combined evaluation
   option. Evaluations flown in this manner must fulfill all current I/Q and Mission evaluation
   requirements, including ground phase requisites. This combined evaluation will have a
   single expiration date IAW AFI 11-202 volume 2.
   2.1.2. If it is impossible to accomplish a required area inflight, the FE may elect to evaluate
   the area(s) by an alternate method (i.e., UTD, cockpit procedure training (CPT), orally, etc.),
   in order to complete the evaluation. If the FE determines the required item cannot be
   adequately evaluated by an alternate method, the examinee will require an additional flight to
   complete the evaluation.
2.2. Instrument/Qualification Evaluation. (T-2). A mission flown according to instrument
flight rules (to the maximum extent practical) best fulfills the objective of the
instrument/qualification evaluation. To the maximum extent possible, this evaluation will
include approaches at airfields other than home or deployed locations (USAFE: Preferably non-
US locations). This evaluation may be administered on any compatible training mission with
the approval of the unit Chief of Stan/Eval with Commander’s concurrence. Minimum ground
phase requisites are:
   2.2.1. Instrument examination.
   2.2.2. Closed and open book qualification examinations.
   2.2.3. EPE.
   2.2.4. Publications that will be checked during the qualification evaluation are:
       2.2.4.1. T.O. 1A-10C-1CL-1.
       2.2.4.2. T.O. 1A-10C-34-1CL-1.
       2.2.4.3. Local Inflight Guide.
       2.2.4.4. Any additional publications specified in the unit supplement to AFI 11-202V2.
   2.2.5. Bold Face Written Exam. Answers must contain all Bold Face items in proper
   sequence. Abbreviations are allowed.
2.3. Mission Evaluation. (T-2). Scenarios that represent unit Designed Operational Capability
(DOC) tasking satisfy the requirements of this evaluation. The profiles will be designed to
evaluate the training/flight position/special qualifications as well as basic airmanship of the
 10                                                            AFI11-2A-10CV2 30 JUNE 2014


examinee. Initial mission evaluations will be given in the primary DOC of the unit. Mission
evaluations will normally be flown using unit formations and tactics. Examinees will only be
evaluated on those areas for which they are qualified. Examinees will be evaluated in the
position of their highest qualification. If briefed, at the FEs discretion, portions may be flown in
another position, but the emphasis is to have examinees evaluated at their highest qualification
level. Based on the examinee’s experience level, a wingman may be required to brief (to include
tactics) and/or lead certain phases of the mission, but will not be evaluated using flight lead
grading criteria. Evaluations during exercises or deployments are encouraged.
   2.3.1. Minimum ground phase requisites are:
       2.3.1.1. EPE
       2.3.1.2. Bold Face Written Exam. Answers must contain all Bold Face items in proper
       sequence. Abbreviations are allowed.
   2.3.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC) pilots. BMC pilots will only be evaluated on those
   missions routinely performed.
   2.3.3. Air to Surface. First look navigation and lookalike targets are encouraged.
   Navigation should be of sufficient length relative to unit plans, with timing appropriate to the
   tasking. Mission profiles should include actual delivery of practice or live ordnance.
   Ordnance deliveries may be dry if they can be validated. In addition, dry passes are
   permitted if, in the FE's opinion:
       2.3.3.1. Accomplishing an actual delivery would significantly decrease the realism of the
       sortie.
       2.3.3.2. The mission profile is a realistic sortie and allows a thorough evaluation of the
       examinee, but does not terminate on a range.
   2.3.4. Forward Air Control (FAC). Air to surface evaluation requirements/grading criteria
   will be used IAW paragraph 2.3.3
2.4. Formal Course Evaluation. (T-2). Syllabus evaluations will be flown IAW syllabus
mission profile guidelines if stated, or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training
objectives. Formal course guidelines may be modified, based on local operating considerations
or FE judgment, to complete the evaluation. Training objectives and related areas will be graded
using the performance criteria in Chapter 3.
2.5. Instructor Evaluation. (T-2). Instructor evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-
202V2, Chapter 4. Flight evaluations will include a thorough evaluation of the examinee’s
instructor knowledge and ability. This is a one-time check in which the examinee must
demonstrate ability to instruct in some phase of the unit’s mission. Except for requirements
delineated in Table 2.1 specific profiles and/or events will be determined by the flight examiner.
Subsequent evaluations (for example, Instrument/Qualification, Mission) will include instructor
portions during the evaluations.
   2.5.1. Instructor pilots (IPs) should demonstrate proficiency in flying a portion of the
   mission in the chase position.
   2.5.2. Formal Training Unit (FTU) and Weapons Instructor School (WIC) Instructor
   Pilot. (T-2). FTU and WIC Instructor Pilot mission evaluation profiles will normally be

* Indicates Critical Area
1. Airwork/Advanced Handling/Tactical Maneuvering. This area is required for pilots receiving
    Instrument/Qualification evaluations. Units will determine appropriate proficiency maneuvers
    for type aircraft and/or pilot experience levels. Examples are, but are not limited to:
    1. Aerobatics
    1. Confidence maneuvers
    1. Approaches to stalls
    1. Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM)
    1. Advanced handling characteristics
    1. Formation (close, tactical, trail)
1. Unusual Attitude Recoveries. Do not perform unusual attitude recoveries in flight. They will
    be evaluated during EPEs.
 Precision Approach: Both a Precision Approach Radar (PAR) and an ILS must be evaluated if
    equipment and facilities are available. However, if facilities or equipment are not available,
    the flight evaluation may be completed as long as one precision approach is flown. 
 It may be impractical to evaluate these required items on certain FTU and WIC instructor
    evaluations due to student syllabus constraints (e.g., BFM mission checks). Squadron
    commanders may approve these exceptions on a limited basis to validate instructor
    effectiveness. Document in the Comments portion of the AF FORM-8. 

     3.4.1.11. Area 61—Timing: Timing is based upon ordnance impact using Time on
     Target (TOT) or Time to Target (TTT). This area may be evaluated as a First Run Attack
     (FRA) or with FAC coordination. Adjustments in TOT/TTT may be made for non-
     aircrew caused delays. In the case of "no spot", timing will be adjusted to bomb release
     plus time of flight. If range clearance is delayed, time at a pre-planned IP may be
     substituted for TOT. The FE may widen this timing criterion if the examinee was forced
     to maneuver extensively along the ingress route due to simulated enemy air or ground
     defense reactions, ATC instructions, and/or weather.
        3.4.1.11.1. Q. ± 1 minute. Covered TOT.
        3.4.1.11.2. Q-. ± 2 minutes. Covered TOT.
        3.4.1.11.3. U. Exceeded Q- parameters. Failed to cover TOT due to inadequate
