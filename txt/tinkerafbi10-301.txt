1. Purpose: This Instruction provides guidance for the deployment and maintenance of
Automated External Defibrillators (AED) within buildings at Tinker AFB. The AED is to be
used for an emergency response to Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA), as a means to decrease
premature mortality. Key to the successful resuscitation of a cardiac arrest victim is the ―AED
Chain of Survival‖ (Attachment 2). This OI shall further identify and delineate the lines of
responsibility and provide general guidelines to initiate and maintain the Public Access
Defibrillation Program (PAD).
2. Scope: This document describes the role and responsibilities deemed necessary to ensure the
broadest training and application of the PAD Program. The scope of training and use is
applicable to all federal employees and active duty personnel at Tinker AFB.
3. Roles and Responsibilities:
     3.1. 72d Air Base Wing Commander:
        3.1.1. Has the overall responsibility for the PAD program. Appoints an installation PAD
        Coordinator.

TINKERAFBI10-301 16 MAY 2012                                                                 3


  3.5. Logistic and Maintenance:
     3.5.1. Procurement and receipt of AEDs will be coordinated by the purchasing unit with
     the nearest medical logistic office. The 72 MDG medical equipment repair center
     (MERC) will provide limited maintenance such as battery replacement (which must be
     provided by the unit) if indicated. Should an AED require further servicing, the
     Installation PAD Coordinator will arrange maintenance or service with the manufacturer.
     The MERC is responsible for periodically certifying AED accountability, monitoring
     safety recall/health device alert notification and ensuring subsequent recall remedies are
     completed.
  3.6. Unit Commander:
     3.6.1. The unit commander of each unit that purchases an AED shall appoint an AED
     POC in writing who will serve as the primary liaison between the local organization’s
     AED program, installation PAD coordinator, PAD Medical Director and medical
     logistics.
     3.6.2. The PAD program is not a ―medical‖ program. It is a ―user‖ program. Therefore,
     each unit commander is responsible for providing funds for the initial AED purchase as
     well as for replacement supplies and for training workers in each area in CPR and AED
     use.
     3.6.3. Each unit commander is authorized to purchase and deploy the numbers of AEDs
     necessary for their organization. The unit commander will coordinate with the AED
     Medical Director and installation PAD coordinator to ensure appropriate unit coverage
     and prescription for AED purchase.
  3.7. AED POC:
     3.7.1. Will be a member of the unit where the AED is deployed.
     3.7.2. Is responsible for maintenance (daily visual check IAW manufacture’s guidance,
     check expiration dates of supplies monthly, maintain a 90-day record of daily checks) of
     the AED to ensure its readiness for use and follows manufacturer’s suggested protocol
     for the particular AED.
     3.7.3. Be responsible for the re-stocking of accessory supplies after a unit has been used
     in an emergency situation (Attachment 5. This attachment is not an endorsement of a
     particular brand of AED.)
     3.7.4. Ensures validation of annual American Red Cross or biannual American Heart
     Association CPR/AED of core staff members to ensure they are properly trained,
     certified and/or recertified in CPR procedure. The AED POC will maintain a current list
     of certified personnel.
     3.7.5. Conduct and document quarterly CPR/AED exercises with feedback to
     participants to ensure staff knows AED location, that all equipment is operational and
     staff responds appropriately. If the AED POC needs additional guidance, contact the
     Installation PAD Coordinator or PAD Medical Director as the local resource (Refer to
     AFMC Instruction 10-301, Attachments 9-11.).
 4                                                            TINKERAFBI10-301 16 MAY 2012


        3.7.6. Ensures AEDs with adequate supplies are centrally located to facilitate quick
        access.
        3.7.7. Ensures universal AED signage at AED locations is installed.
        3.7.8. Ensures building occupants know the locations of the AEDs.
        3.7.9. Ensures trained first responders can administer the AEDs to victims within four
        (4) minutes.
        3.7.10. Ensures AEDs are fully mission capable.
        3.7.11. Will immediately complete the AED Coordinated Report for PAD Medical
        Director (Attachment 3) once an AED has been used in an emergency situation and
        forward it to the Medical Director for review. The PAD Medical Director should receive
        the complete report within one (1) duty day of employing the AED.
        3.7.12. Will arrange for Traumatic Stress Response (formerly known as Critical Incident
        Stress management or CISM) debriefing sessions to be offered for all individuals
        involved in providing assistance in an emergency situation (Attachment 4).
     3.8. Responders:
        3.8.1. Responders are individuals who are certified in Basic Life Support (BLS) and who
        will respond to an emergency and initiate BLS as necessary. Individuals do not need to
        be BLS trained to assist with retrieving AED or activating EMS.
        3.8.2. Follow the protocol in an emergency situation using the most current American
        Heart Association guidelines.
4. AED Selection:
     4.1. Companies offer different types of AEDs, each with a range of capabilities and prices.
     A single model, recommended by the PAD Medical Director, should be purchased for the
     installation. Standardization of models will ease responder familiarization, unit maintenance
     and supply logistics.
5. AED Location and Installation:
     5.1. The key to surviving cardiac arrest is early defibrillation. Therefore, AEDs must be
     strategically placed throughout the organization in order to facilitate early defibrillation.
        5.1.1. Although there are no thresholds to define which facilities need a certain number
        of AEDs, factors to consider include the following:
            5.1.1.1. Facility size and/ or accessibility.
            5.1.1.2. Number of employees in the facility.
            5.1.1.3. Identified high-risk environments (i.e. possibility of electrical shock, etc.).
            5.1.1.4. Number of people with public access to the facility on a daily basis.
            5.1.1.5. Average age of the facility occupants.
            5.1.1.6. Risk factors for heart disease in the population such as smoking, obesity and
            chronic health problems.
TINKERAFBI10-301 16 MAY 2012                                                                 5


     5.1.2. In order to achieve complete area coverage within a building, an AED should be
     positioned no more than one (1) minute’s travel time in one direction from any given
     point within the building.
     5.1.3. Optimal response time from the identification of a person ‖down‖ to the arrival of
     AED on-scene is three (3) minutes or less.
     5.1.4. Optimal response time from the identification of a person down to the delivery of a
     shock (i.e.; drop-to-shock) should be four (4) minutes or less.
     5.1.5. AED accessory kits should be packed with the AED so that the responder will not
     lose time deciding what to take to the emergency. These kits should provide items such
     as gloves, scissors, razor, tape, extra electrodes and a barrier mask (Attachment 5).
     5.1.6. AEDs should be stored in such a way that an alarm is activated when the unit is
     removed for use. This alarm can draw assistance to the scene.

**In Case of Emergency, Initiate Chain of Survival**
Call 9-1-1 and identify location


       1. Assess scene safety
       2. Assess responsiveness. Tap shoulder and shout, ―Are you OK?‖
       3. Activate emergency response plan: Phone 911, if using a cell phone tell the operator
          that the emergency is on Tinker AFB and Get the AED
       4. Check Breathing
       5. If person is not breathing or is only gasping, give CPR
       6. Give 30 compressions at a rate of at least 100 a minutes and a depth of at least 2 inches.
          After each compression, let the chest come back up to its normal position
       7. Open airway and give 2 breaths
       8. Keep giving sets of 30 compressions and 2 breaths until AED arrives, the person
          starts to respond, or help arrives and take over

Early Defibrillation
       When AED arrives:
              Place the AED near the head of the patient on the same side as the rescuer.
              Turn on the AED.
              Prepare the ―bare‖ chest.
                       - Cut or tear away clothing.
                       - If chest hair is excessive, shave or clip.
                       - If chest wall is wet, dry it before placing electrode pads.
              Follow the AED’s verbal and visual prompts.
              Apply electrodes.
              Allow the AED to analyze. Do not touch the victim
              If indicated, deliver shock by pressing the illuminated shock button. Make sure
              no one is touching the person before giving a shock
              Continue care per the AED prompts.


Early Advance Care Life Support

Remember—maintain a working AED on-site at all times


Contact the PAD Medical Director and provide this sheet filled out with as much
information as possible within 24 hours of the Cardiac Event.


If for scheduling reasons (night shift, holiday etc.) the above cannot be done, deliver the
completed paperwork the next working day.


Replace any used items right away. Every organization should have an extra set of pads
and an extra battery or data chip available to allow the AED to be placed back in service
once it is cleared for use by the base medical maintenance section and the PAD medical
director.

                     TRAUMATIC STRESS RESPONSE
      (FORMERLY KNOWN AS CRITICAL INCIDENT STRESS MANAGEMENT OR
                                CISM)

What is Traumatic Stress Response? It is a comprehensive system of crisis intervention
designed to assist individuals and groups affected by traumatic events (natural disasters, terrorist
events, and suicides, death - either accidental or intentional).


What events might precipitate a request for Traumatic Stress Response (TSR) services?
Many types of events have the potential to produce individual and community traumatic stress.
Events include: large scale disasters (tornadoes, bombings, hurricanes, etc.) and small scale
disasters (suicide, death or near-death of coworker, workplace violence event, etc.). TSR
services will be provided after traumatic events to help those who have experienced the events.
The goal is to assist those affected by traumatic events to cope with the normal stress reaction in
an effective manner. These actions are intended to minimize the impact of exposure to these
events and prevent or mitigate permanent disability, if possible.


What is the procedure for requesting TSR services? Contact the Mental Health Clinic,
72 MDOS/SGOW, at 734-4393.
