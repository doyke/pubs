8.4.1.1. (Added) The approving authority (56 FW/CV) designates the group commander as both
appointing and approving authority when the amount of loss or damage is less than $2,000 and
there is no evidence of negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use.
8.4.4. The ROSPM has the authority to not process an ROS when the dollar value or property
damage is under $500 and all other stipulations are met IAW AFMAN 23-220, Chapter 3.
9.1. The ROS appointing authorities are the 56th Maintenance Group Commander, 56th
Operations Group Commander, 56th Medical Group Commander, and 56th Mission Support
Group Commander (56 MSG/CC). The 56 MSG/CC is the appointing authority for tenant units.
11.2. The 56th Logistics Readiness Squadron administers the ROS Program.
11.7.1. (Added) The ROSPM will:
11.7.1.1. (Added) Brief unit commanders on ROS responsibilities and assist as requested.

ROS initiation and review through the remaining coordination channels.

Cash Collection Voucher, for cash payment, or DD Form 362, Statement of Charges for
Government Property Lost, Damaged, or Destroyed, for payroll deduction. Once completed, the
individual and unit commander will sign and return the DD Form 362 to the ROSPM.
