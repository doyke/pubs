         GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING AIRFIELD FACILITIES

1.1. Runways and Taxiways.
   1.1.1. Patterson Field has two active parallel runways oriented northeast/southwest.
   Distance between runway centerlines is 1,325 ft. Field elevation is 823 ft MSL as measured
   at the approach end of RWY 23R (See Attachment 3).
      1.1.1.1. RWY 05L/23R is a 12,600 ft long, 300 ft wide Class B precision runway with no
      shoulders and is grooved to USAF standards. It has a 900 ft overrun on the northeast end
      and 1,000 ft overrun on the southwest end. The first 2,600 ft of RWY 05L is concrete
      and is the only portion of the airfield where Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL)
      aircraft operations are authorized. The remaining surface of RWY 5L/23R and all of
      RWY 05R/23L is asphalt.
      1.1.1.2. RWY 05R/23L is a 7,000 ft long 150 ft wide Class A non-precision runway with
      no shoulders. It is a non-grooved runway with a 345 ft overrun on the southwest end.
      RWY 05R/23L may be closed during snow removal operations or heavy rainfall due to
      potential hydroplaning.
   1.1.2. Patterson Field has four taxiways designated Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, and Delta (See
   Attachment 3).
      1.1.2.1. TWY Alpha is 75 ft wide and runs parallel to RWY 05L/23R for the full length
      of the runway’s western edge. Pilots in Command (PIC) are cautioned not to mistake
      TWY Alpha for a runway. TWY Alpha 1 is 75 ft wide and connects TWY Alpha with
      the northwest entrance to the West Ramp.
      1.1.2.2. TWY Bravo is 75 ft wide except for TWY Bravo 2 (non-standard 50 ft) and
      Bravo between RWY 05L/23R and 05R/23L (non-standard 300 ft at widest point). TWY
      Bravo crosses the approach end of RWY 23L. PICs and vehicle operators are cautioned
      as this crossing point can be deceiving.
      1.1.2.3. TWY Charlie is 75 ft wide and intersects TWY Alpha, RWY 05L/23R, RWY
      05R/23L, and TWY Bravo.
      1.1.2.4. TWY Delta is 75 ft wide between TWY Alpha and RWY 05R/23L. TWY Delta
      between RWY 05R/23L and the East Ramp is non-standard 50 ft wide without shoulders.
      TWY Delta between TWY Bravo and RWY 05R/23L, is restricted to aircraft with a
      wingspan of 110 ft and smaller. Exception: C-130 aircraft are allowed to taxi on this
      portion of TWY Delta. Aircraft with four engines shall shutdown outboard engines.
1.2. Parking Plan.
   1.2.1. East Ramp Parking Plan (See Attachment 4).
      1.2.1.1. Delta parking row standard configuration is sited for A-10 aircraft and smaller.
      1.2.1.2. Echo parking row standard configuration is sited for A-10 aircraft and smaller.
      1.2.1.3. Foxtrot parking row standard configuration is sited for C-172 aircraft and
      smaller.
 8                                        WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-201 25 JUNE 2013


        1.2.1.4. Golf parking row standard configuration is sited for C-21 aircraft and smaller.
        1.2.1.5. Hotel parking row standard configuration is sited for the dimension of four C-17
        aircraft and smaller. Aircraft with a wingspan larger than 174 ft will require a non-
        standard parking plan configuration.
        1.2.1.6. India parking row standard configuration is sited for the dimension of two C-5
        aircraft and smaller.
        1.2.1.7. Hazardous Cargo Pad’s (HAZPAD) 1-4 (See Table 1.2):
            1.2.1.7.1. Any aircraft with a tail height of 49 ft or greater will not park on HAZPAD
            2. It violates the 50:1 ratio of the Approach/Departures Clearance Surface (ADCS)
            for RWY 05R/23L.
     1.2.2. West Ramp Parking Plan (See Attachment 5):
        1.2.2.1. Parking spots A1-A9 standard configuration are sited for C-17 aircraft. Parking
        spots A10-A12 standard configuration are dual sited for C-5/C-17 aircraft (See Table
        1.2).
     1.2.3. All non-standard parking of aircraft must be prior coordinated and approved by the
     Airfield Manager (AFM) or designated representative.
1.3. Permanently Closed Airfield Surfaces.
     1.3.1. Wright Field (KDWF). Wright Field is closed and arrangements must be coordinated
     to open it for USAF Museum aircraft deliveries and special aerial events IAW the LOA
     between 88 ABW and National Museum of the USAF (NMUSAF), Wright Field Operations.
     The USAF Museum originates the request to open Wright Field to the approval authority,
     HQ AFMC/A3 (See Attachment 2).
        1.3.1.1. After operation approval is received from HQ AFMC/A3, the following
        procedures and requirements apply:
            1.3.1.1.1. Landings are made on RWY 09 only (elevation 830' MSL).
            1.3.1.1.2. The operation is conducted during VFR/daylight hours and with runway
            surface condition (RSC) DRY.
            1.3.1.1.3. The length of RWY 09 (7147 x 150 ft) must be adequate to allow a safe
            landing for the type of aircraft concerned (runway is marked with yellow X’s spaced
            about 1,000 ft apart along its length and may be used by the PIC as a rough guide for
            runway distance remaining). RWY 09 runway surface is asphalt. RWY 09 runway
            markings are IAW ETL 04-2 for a closed runway.
            1.3.1.1.4. The Base Weather Station (WX) will supply a portable anemometer to
            provide wind information for relay to the aircraft. Winds must be within safe limits
            for the type of aircraft concerned (as determined by the PIC).
            1.3.1.1.5. AFM, OSS Director of Special Operations, or designated representative
            will:
               1.3.1.1.5.1. Notify the Fire Department (FD) at least one working day in advance
               for fire/crash emergency vehicle standby at Wright Field.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-201 25 JUNE 2013                                                          9


             1.3.1.1.5.2. Notify Security Forces (SFS) at least one working day in advance for
             crowd and vehicle control at Wright Field.
             1.3.1.1.5.3. Coordinate with Patterson Tower at least one business day in
             advance.
             1.3.1.1.5.4. Coordinate with the Wing Safety Office (SE) and Public Affairs
             (PA).
             1.3.1.1.5.5. Determine if foreign object debris (FOD) sweeping is required on
             RWY 09 prior to a landing and, if so, will coordinate with Base Civil Engineering
             (CE) to accomplish sweeping operations.
             1.3.1.1.5.6. Brief the PIC on the following:
             1.3.1.1.5.7. Traffic pattern direction (left-hand at Wright Field).
             1.3.1.1.5.8. Traffic pattern altitude (same as Patterson Field for type of aircraft
             concerned).
             1.3.1.1.5.9. Coordinate with Air Force Research Lab (AFRL), Bldg 622, DSN
             785-6361, before a landing is made at Wright Field to de-conflict any possible
             laser activity encompassing RWY 09.
             1.3.1.1.5.10. Be on-scene to inspect the runway before the landing, provide
             landing advisories to the arrival aircraft and exercise overall supervision.
          1.3.1.1.6. Radio frequency for communication between aircraft and AMOPS vehicle
          use 88 ABW discrete UHF 289.4/VHF 123.225, if possible.
          1.3.1.1.7. The aircraft normally lands at Patterson Field (KFFO) prior to USAF
          Museum delivery so the PIC may be taken to Wright Field for a visual inspection of
          RWY 09, with any hazards and obstructions specifically pointed out. If this is
          impractical, a visit by the aircrew to WPAFB prior to the delivery flight for a pre-site
          survey and/or a detailed visual presentation (i.e. video, PowerPoint, etc.) by the AFM
          or other authorized designated official of Wright Field’s runway is required.
          1.3.1.1.8. Flights originating at Patterson Field for a landing at Wright Field requires
          the PIC to file a flight plan with Patterson Field Airfield Management (AM).
          1.3.1.1.9. USAF Museum point of contact is the Special Events Division,
          NMUSAF/MUS.
   1.3.2. TWY Bravo 1 is closed.
   1.3.3. Aero Club Apron and Hangars are closed.
1.4. Unusable Airfield Surfaces.
   1.4.1. TWY Delta between RWY 05R Approach (APCH) end and East Ramp is unusable.
1.5. Runway Selection Procedures.
   1.5.1. RWYs 23L/R are designated the calm wind runways and are used unless an
   operational advantage makes it necessary to use RWYs 05L/R.
 10                                      WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-201 25 JUNE 2013


   1.5.2. Tower Watch Supervisor (WS) shall coordinate with Columbus (CMH) Approach
   prior to changing the runway in use. Tower WS is the final authority for runway selection.
   1.5.3. Tower shall update the Airfield Automation System (AFAS) and notify the following
   agencies when a RWY change is complete:
      1.5.3.1. CMH.
      1.5.3.2. Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS).
      1.5.3.3. WX.
      1.5.3.4. FD.
1.6. Aircraft Arresting Systems (AAS) (see Attachment 3).
   1.6.1. Patterson Field has two installed AAS: BAK-12(B)/TYPE H located 1,676 ft from the
   approach end of RWY 05L and BAK-12(B)/14 located 1,740 ft from the approach end of
   RWY 23R. Both AAS cables are bi-directional and primarily operated by Tower.
   1.6.2. There are two “Barrier Shacks” on either side of RWY 05L/23R in line with each
   AAS (4 total on the airfield) and are not equipped with evacuation bailout alarms.
   1.6.3. The AAS cables are maintained in the down position unless requested by PIC or as
   required.
   1.6.4. Barrier Maintenance (88 CEOFP) is responsible for daily AAS operating inspections,
   maintenance, and repair during normal duty hours (weekdays, between the hours of 0730L
   and 1600L). Results of all AAS daily checks will be reported to AMOPS. Barrier
   Maintenance must re-certify the AAS after each engagement regardless of date/time.
      1.6.4.1. FD assumes responsibility for AAS outside normal duty hours to include
      holidays, weekends, and during non-availability of Barrier Maintenance personnel.
   1.6.5. AMOPS will post AAS status on the AFAS and Airfield Status Display. AMOPS will
   also perform visual checks of the AAS when Tower reports a suspected malfunction.
   1.6.6. AAS Engagement:
      1.6.6.1. Engagement of any AAS by an aircraft shall be treated as an emergency except
      for those instances of planned engagements for system tests and/or certifications. (See
      paragraph 5.5).
   1.6.7. AAS Certification Procedures (Must be accomplished annually):
      1.6.7.1. AMOPS will be on-site to coordinate operations between aircraft, Tower, FD
      and any other required responders. AMOPS will also ensure aircraft tug and tow bar are
      in place. AMOPS shall solicit aircraft’s landing weight and speed of engagement from
      the PIC and relay information to IC. If possible, AMOPS will establish contact with
      aircraft on 88 ABW discreet frequency UHF 289.4/VHF 123.225. If unable, AMOPS
      will request Tower to relay data to aircraft.
      1.6.7.2. When aircraft is capable of taxiing, tail hook can be raised and the arresting gear
      cable is clear of the hook, with concurrence from the Incident Commander (IC) and PIC,
      request the aircraft to taxi clear of the runway.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-201 25 JUNE 2013                                                          11


       1.6.7.3. If the arresting system cable won't release from the tail hook, a procedure
       nicknamed "sling-shoting" may be attempted with PIC and ABW/CC approval. Clear the
       area fore and aft of the aircraft and ask the PIC to accelerate ahead slightly for a short
       distance using engine thrust, allowing the cable to reach its maximum run out distance
       and then reducing engine thrust to idle (aircraft brakes are not applied). The aircraft is
       gently pulled backward by a natural "slingshot" action of the cable, and the tail hook
       should "coast" clear of the cable.
       1.6.7.4. If aircraft engines are shut down, the tail hook cannot be raised for any reason,
       or the cable cannot be freed from the hook, then the aircraft must be towed.
       1.6.7.5. If aircraft engines are not shut down, TA will pin landing gear as required when
       cleared by the IC. If cable is free of the tail hook and the hook can be raised, with IC and
       PIC concurrence, use a "follow-me" truck and have PIC taxi aircraft to the parking ramp.
       1.6.7.6. When the aircraft is clear of the runway, inspect for FOD and reopen the runway
       as soon as possible. Ensure Barrier Maintenance inspects and resets the arresting system.
       1.6.7.7. TA responsibilities:
          1.6.7.7.1. Respond with tug, tow bar, landing gear pins and other tools and
          equipment as required.
1.7. Airfield Lighting Systems.
   1.7.1. RWY 05L/23R:
       1.7.1.1. High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRL).
       1.7.1.2. Runway Distance Markers (RDM).
       1.7.1.3. Runway Guard Lights (RGL), also known as wig-wags, are located at TWY
       Alpha/RWY 23R VFR mandatory hold line, TWY Alpha INST hold line and TWY
       Bravo/RWY 23L VFR mandatory hold line and are tied in with the runway edge lights.
       1.7.1.4. Arresting Gear Markers (AGM). AAS cable locations are indicated by 40-inch
       diameter yellow disks (arresting gear markers) on each side of the runway which are
       internally illuminated for night time use.
       1.7.1.5. Approach Light System with Sequence Flashing Lights (ALSF-1).
          1.7.1.5.1. RWY 05L/23R Sequenced Flashing Lights (SFLs) are unserviceable
          because they are not tied into ALSF-1 intensity settings IAW UFC 3-535-01 para 3-
          1.4.1.
       1.7.1.6. Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI).
          1.7.1.6.1. RWY 23R PAPIs are non-standard as they are positioned on the right side
          of RWY 23R.
          1.7.1.6.2. PAPIs are at a 3 degree angle coincidental to Instrument Landing System
          (ILS).
   1.7.2. RWY 05R/23L.
       1.7.2.1. Medium Intensity Runway Lights (MIRL). These lights are preset to the highest
       step for MIRLs and are not adjustable.

WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI13-201 25 JUNE 2013                                                            15


       1.16.3.2. The reported ceiling is below 800 ft and/or the reported visibility is less than 2
       miles.
           1.16.3.2.1. Tower will visually verify sterilization of any vehicles operating in the
           active ILS/GS critical area. All vehicles operating on the TWY must monitor the
           Tower NET (LMR) IAW the local ADI. When Tower is unable to visually check or
           contact vehicles via two-way radio, AMOPS will be contacted to physically check the
           area.
           1.16.3.2.2. Upon notification from Tower that ILS critical areas are protected,
           AMOPS will make a broadcast announcement over the BASE OPS NET (LMR)
           stating: “ILS CRITICAL AREAS ARE PROTECTED”. AMOPS will also inform
           personnel reporting entry onto the airfield, as applicable.
   1.16.4. If in doubt, the vehicle operator will contact Tower for permission to enter any
   critical area.
   1.16.5. Two-way radio contact must be maintained with Tower while operating in the
   ILS/GS critical area when any of the conditions in paragraph 1.16.3 exist.
1.17. Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ) (See Attachment 6).
   1.17.1. The POFZ is an 800 ft wide by 200 ft long rectangular area centered on the RWY
   centerline, beginning at and extending outward from the threshold, designed to protect
   aircraft flying precision approaches from ground vehicles and other aircraft when the ceiling
   is less than 300 ft, or visibility is less than three-quarter (3/4) statute mile (or Runway Visual
   Range (RVR) below 4,000 ft).
   1.17.2. Exception: vehicles less than 10 ft in height operating outside of the movement area
   and necessary for the maintenance of the airport and/or navigation facilities are allowed to
   traverse the POFZ. These vehicles will maintain radio contact with Tower when allowed to
   park in these areas. There are no normal vehicle operations in the POFZ except for mowers.
   1.17.3. Prior to access into the POFZ, all personnel will be briefed by AMOPS.
   1.17.4. Vehicles over 10 ft in height must remain outside of the POFZ during inclement
   weather. Vehicle operators must contact Tower to determine if the ceiling and visibility will
   restrict operations.

      NET and process an applicable NOTAM.
      1.27.3.2. Tower will direct all aircraft not in direct support of the event to remain clear of
      the ramp isolation area.
      1.27.3.3. SFS will report to the airfield 15 minutes prior to the activation of ramp ISO to
      prevent all non-essential vehicles/pedestrians from accessing the affected ramp at
      applicable airfield gates, and/or surrounding areas. SFS will not impede aircraft
      operations or the detail in support of the event.
1.28. Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Capabilities (ARFF).
   1.28.1. In the event the FD’s ability to provide aircraft fire coverage increases or decreases,
   due to the availability of firefighting assets, FD will provide AMOPS with ARFF vehicle and
   aircraft category set status. These procedures are IAW AFPAM 32-2004, Aircraft Fire
   Protection for Exercises and Contingency Response Operations.
      1.28.1.1. Category/Status Definitions:
          1.28.1.1.1. Red. Fire fighting forces cannot be expected to be successful in interior
          aircraft fire suppression/rescue operations. Fire fighting forces can perform only
          limited exterior fire suppression. Aircrew must exit under their own power; rescue of
          trapped personnel should not be expected.
          1.28.1.1.2. Yellow. Interior/exterior aircraft/rescue or fire suppression capability is
          severely limited. Fire fighting forces can still be expected to fight and control
          exterior fires in such a manner as to maintain a rescue path for one minute. Aircrew
          must exit under their own power; attempted rescue of trapped personnel severely
          endangers rescuers.
          1.28.1.1.3. Green. Reasonable expectation fire fighting forces will be successful at
          interior/exterior aircraft fire suppression and rescue of aircrew.

     1.32.3.5. AFM or designated representative will:
        1.32.3.5.1. Monitor airfield surfaces for snow/ice buildup during winter weather
        conditions. During changing weather conditions conduct more frequent airfield
        checks to ensure airfield is mission capable at all times.
            1.32.3.5.1.1. As a general rule, begin snow or ice removal operations when
            airfield markings become obscured or the runway is ice-covered. Contact CE
            Snow Desk or CE Service Call Desk.
            1.32.3.5.1.2. Conduct airfield inspections/checks as snow or ice conditions
            require. Ensure snow removal activities do not create windrows that interfere
            with aircraft operations on runways, taxiways, and aircraft parking aprons that

   program and is designed to minimize aircraft exposure to harmful effects of bird and wildlife.
   8.22.2. RESPONSIBILITIES. All required actions are outlined in the current WPAFB
   BASH Plan; all users on/around Wright Field and Patterson Field will adhere to the current
   BASH Plan. All personnel who work around the airfield should be alert for bird activity and
   should report such activity directly to Tower on the LMR Tower talk group, or AMOPS on
   PTD frequency (UHF 372.2, VHF 126.2), landline, or the Base Ops LMR talk group. The
   responsibility to declare a bird watch condition lies (primarily) with Airfield Management.
   Using information from any credible source, Airfield Management personnel will use the
   below definitions as a guide in determining bird watch conditions. Under MODERATE or
   SEVERE bird watch conditions, disperse bird concentrations as required.
8.23. Bird Watch Conditions (BWC).
   8.23.1. BWCs are provided to indicate the level of activity around WPAFB, estimate the
   hazard, and allow aircrews and flying units to implement their internal BASH procedures.
   BWCs are based on continuous bird activity lasting for more than one minute. Large birds
   are considered any bird that appears or is known to weigh more than four pounds each.
   Small birds are all other birds. Conditions are defined as follows:
      8.23.1.1. BWC LOW. Unless specifically notified of moderate or severe conditions, all
      agencies should assume a low condition is in effect.
          8.23.1.1.1. Definition. Normal bird activity on and above the airfield with minimal
          bird hazard.
          8.23.1.1.2. Actions required. Post conditions in AMOPS.
      8.23.1.2. BWC MODERATE. This condition requires increased vigilance by all
      agencies and supervisors and caution by aircrews.
          8.23.1.2.1. Definition. Either of the following:
              8.23.1.2.1.1. Concentration of 3-5 large birds or 15-20 small birds near the
              runways, in the approach/departure areas, in areas that are likely to infringe on
              aircraft flight paths, or in areas that may represent an increased potential for
              strike.
              8.23.1.2.1.2. Concentration of 5-20 large birds or 20-30 small birds on or in close
              proximity to taxiways and areas inside the airfield fence.
              8.23.1.2.1.3. Actions required. All aircraft takeoff and landings allowed at the
              discretion of the PIC. No transition training simulated flameout or formation
              landings/takeoffs allowed.
