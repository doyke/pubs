                                                 Preface
SCOPE
This multi-Service publication represents a significant revision of the November 1986 publication. The scope of
the previous publication was limited to the effect that weather and terrain have on nuclear, biological, and
chemical (NBC) operations and obscuration operations. This publication expands that scope to include the
doctrinal employment of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) capabilities (organizations,
personnel, technology, and information) to characterize CBRN threats and hazards, including toxic industrial
material (TIM), to the commander and the force. It is designed to provide commanders and staffs at the
operational and tactical levels with capability employment planning data and considerations to shape military
operations involving CBRN threats and hazards (CBRN shape) and a better understanding of where and when
to expect CBRN hazards by applying information management (IM) to the military decisionmaking process
(MDMP)/Marine Corps planning process (MCPP). This publication incorporates the characteristics of CBRN
shape as addressed in joint concepts and in doctrine; and it provides doctrine and tactics, techniques, and
procedures (TTP) for managing CBRN threats and hazards in the larger context of multi-Service military
operations. The chapters present a doctrinal foundation, and specific TTP are included in appendixes. This
manual also incorporates the joint doctrine elements for combating weapons of mass destruction (WMD), to
include the passive defense capabilities of CBRN shape, CBRN sense, CBRN shield, and CBRN sustain.
During military operations, this publication is subordinate to current joint publications (JPs) addressing this
topic. This document incorporates the following key guidance—
              National strategy to combat WMD.
              National military strategy to combat WMD.
              Department of Defense (DOD) protection joint functional concept.
              Joint enabling concept for CBRN defense.
              JP 3-40.

PURPOSE
The purpose of this publication is to provide commanders, staffs, key agencies, and Service members with a key
reference for understanding, characterizing, and managing CBRN threats and hazards in a particular operational
environment (OE). This manual bridges the gap between Service and joint doctrine. It contains TTP for
commanders and staff to use for characterizing and managing CBRN threats and hazards while conducting
multi-Service military operations. This manual addresses concepts, principles, fundamentals, planning,
operational considerations, and training and support functions. It serves as the foundation for developing
Service manuals and refining existing training support packages, mission training plans, training center and unit
exercises, and Service school curricula. It drives the examination of organizations and materiel developments
applicable to military support of CBRN aspects of command and control (C2).

APPLICATION
This publication is designed for use at the operational and tactical levels but has implications at the strategic
level in the implementation of CBRN supporting strategic objectives. The manual will support command staffs,
CBRN staff officers, CBRN noncommissioned officers (NCOs), non-CBRN personnel performing collateral
duties as additional-duty CBRN officers or NCOs, and employees of civilian agencies in the assessment,
planning, preparation, and execution of CBRN C2 functions. This publication is intended to provide multi-
Service C2 concepts and considerations for planning for, responding to, and recovering from CBRN events. It is
not stand-alone guidance for United States (U.S.) Air Force (USAF) CBRN actions and activities. It is
applicable to USAF units and USAF teams only in conjunction with appropriate USAF-specific publications,
installation plans, supporting checklists, and other appropriate guidance.

USER INFORMATION
A brief description of each chapter and appendix follows:
              Chapter 1 introduces Service commanders and their staffs at the tactical level to the important
               aspects of the joint and Service C2 functions. It does not cover staffs of units at echelons above
               corps and joint level.
              Chapter 2 provides an overview of the OE. It introduces the joint OE variables of political,
               military, economic, social information, and infrastructure, with two added variables used by the
               USA—physical environment and time—as translated into concepts for use by CBRN staffs,
               units, and individuals at the tactical level.
              Chapter 3 provides an overview of CBRN tactical planning considerations for the
               MDMP/MCPP. This section is not intended to replace Service guidance, but to highlight some
               CBRN-related considerations of the planning process that apply to staffs, units, and sections
               during operations.
              Chapter 4 examines the importance of preparedness activities, including key education, training,
               rehearsal, exercise, and health service support (HSS) considerations. Preparation requires the
               steady infusion of new tactical TTP, concept of operations (CONOPS), and standardized
               leadership protocols.

                                                 Chapter 1
  Fundamentals of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
             Nuclear Command and Control
       State and nonstate actors have long sought to acquire and use CBRN weapons against
       the United States and its allies. The threat is increasingly serious and complex as
       these weapons are now more readily available and harder to detect. The U.S. military
       must be diligent in protecting its assets from the effects of CBRN incidents. Effective
       C2 requires the integration with hazards planning, preparation, and execution—along
       with continuous assessment activities—to prevent CBRN incidents from occurring;
       to protect personnel, equipment, and information during a CBRN incident response;
       and to mitigate/recover from a CBRN incident that involves casualties and/or
       contamination.

FUNCTIONS
   1-1. C2 is the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over assigned and
   attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission:
             Command. Command is the authority that a commander in the armed forces lawfully exercises
              over subordinates by virtue of rank or assignment. Command includes the authority and
              responsibility for effectively using available resources and for planning the employment of,
              organizing, directing, coordinating, and controlling military forces for the accomplishment of
              assigned missions. It also includes responsibility for health, welfare, morale, and discipline of
              assigned personnel.
             Control. Control is the regulation of forces and functions to accomplish the mission according
              to the commander’s intent. It includes collecting, processing, displaying, storing, and
              disseminating relevant information for creating the COP and using information—primarily by
              the staff—to synchronize operations through a process. Control allows commanders to
              disseminate their intent, execute decisions, and adjust their operations to reflect changing reality
              and enemy actions. It allows commanders to modify their visualization to account for changing
              circumstances. Control also allows commanders to identify times and points requiring new
              decisions (decision points) during preparation and execution.
   1-2. The CBRN C2 function encompasses the related tasks and systems that support commanders in
   exercising authority and direction in CBRN environments. It includes those tasks associated with acquiring
   friendly and adversarial CBRN capabilities information, managing relevant information, and directing and
   leading subordinates. (See figure 1-1, page 1-2, for an illustration of the CBRN aspects of C2.)

SUPPORT
      1-3. C2 has two components: the commander and the C2 system. CBRN information systems include
      communications systems, prediction and modeling systems, and integrated detection networks; and they
      support the commander’s overall C2 system. CBRN information systems contribute to the prevention of a
      CBRN incident and the protection of the commander’s assets and capabilities. CBRN staffs collaborate
      with the commander and other staff sections supporting the commander’s intent to direct units and control
      resource allocations. They are alert for enemy or friendly situations that require command decisions and
      advise commanders concerning them.
      1-4. The C2 information system provides the commander a secure, real-time/near-real-time COP of the
      CBRN hazard environment within the context of the OE. This capability fuses information from the
      integrated early warning, hazard analysis, and other supporting sources, to include meteorological, terrain,
      intelligence, coalition allies, and civil support information. This capability supports timely decisionmaking
      related to situational awareness (SA); protection; the restoration of operating tempo; and casualty
      treatment, care, and evacuation.

                Fundamentals of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Command and Control



SHAPE FUNCTION
   1-5. The CBRN shape function is fundamental to C2, and supports CBRN passive defense capabilities
   through the integration of CBRN sense, CBRN shield, and CBRN sustain functions. CBRN incident
   characterization enhances situational understanding by enabling commanders to develop a clear
   understanding of the current and predicted CBRN hazard situation and visualize the sequence of events that
   move an installation or deployed force from its current state to the desired end state. It allows commanders
   to make informed decisions regarding the use of counterproliferation components of interdiction
   operations, offensive operations, active defense operations, elimination operations, and passive defense
   operations to characterize CBRN threats and hazards while conducting multi-Service military operations.
   1-6. Significant capabilities of the CBRN shape function are—
           Intelligence. This capability provides multidisciplined, all-source, fused intelligence tools for
            assessing the enemy situation, environment, and civil considerations. The objective is to develop
            a clear definition, understanding, and appreciation of potential CBRN threats and hazards, to
            including disease surveillance and injuries.
           Assessment. This capability provides an all-hazards approach that ensures interoperability;
            promotes the effective use of resources; and protects critical operations, personnel, assets, and
            the environment.
           Integrated detection networks. This capability provides a networked technological
            infrastructure/collaborative environment for sharing CBRN-related information. It consists of
            software segments operating on the information systems and hardware elements that provide the
            physical substrate for sensor connectivity and the architecture for a wired or wireless connection
            to the host C2 platforms.
           Information management. CBRN IM implements warning and reporting measures. This
            capability provides quality information to the right person at the right time in a usable form to
            facilitate understanding and decisionmaking. IM entails collecting and analyzing data from
            assessments within the CBRN sense, CBRN shield, and CBRN sustain functions to support
            CBRN counterproliferation passive defense preparations based on plans, the commander’s
            intent, and the operational context and situation. For example, the Joint Warning and Reporting
            Network (JWARN) is used primarily by CBRN centers to provide joint forces and, in the future,
            DOD incident commanders with a single standardized CBRN defense monitoring, analysis, and
            response capability. JWARN provides the operational capability to collect, analyze, identify,
            locate, report, and disseminate information on CBRN incidents and environmental hazards.
           Capability employment and management. The consideration of how CBRN threats and
            hazards shape military operations imparts an understanding of where and when to expect CBRN
            hazards by applying IM to planning activities. This allows the commander to make informed use
            of counterproliferation components of interdiction operations, offensive operations, active
            defense operations, elimination operations, and passive defense operations to optimize our
            capability to operate in a CBRN environment.
           Health surveillance. This capability provides medical SA and decision support to theater
            commanders in support of ongoing threat assessments and medical decisionmaking and
            planning. Health surveillance includes the capability to—
                Rapidly identify, report, and document CBRN agent threats through laboratory analysis in
                 theater.
                Conduct medical surveillance for health outcomes of operational importance and to conduct
                 epidemiological analysis of medical events and patterns.
                Execute preventive medicine support to food and water safety and occupational and
                 environmental health surveillance missions in a CBRN hazard environment.
                Conduct surveillance of indigenous animal populations to identify diseases of operational
                 importance and information pertaining to ongoing threat assessments.
           CBRN incident response. This capability provides measures or actions taken to save lives,
            protect property, and establish control following a CBRN incident.

Chapter 1



               CBRN incident mitigation. This capability provides measures or actions taken during response
                operations to reduce the harmful effects of the CBRN incident, decrease risks of damage, and
                finish restoring mission capability and essential public and government services interrupted by
                an event.
               Casualty management. This capability allows the planning, preparing, coordinating, and
                providing effective care and management of CBRN casualties to maximize force effectiveness
                by eliminating or reducing the effects of CBRN threats and hazards.

OPERATIONS PROCESS
      1-7. The CBRN operations process is continuous and consists of the major C2 activities that are
      performed concurrently during operations in CBRN environments. Those activities are planning,
      preparation, execution, and continuous assessment . (See figure 1-2 for an illustration of the CBRN
      operations process and chapters 2 through 5 for a thorough discussion of each key activity.)
      1-8. The CBRN operations process serves two important functions for commanders. It—
              Provides a framework that describes the exercise of CBRN aspects of C2.
              Provides a framework for organizing related CBRN information systems and using them to
               conduct operations in CBRN environments.

      1-9. Commanders and staffs conduct CBRN assessments throughout planning, preparation, and
      execution. Commanders synchronize military operations by continuously assessing CBRN threats and
      hazards, the OE, CBRN capabilities, and friendly vulnerabilities.

THREAT ASSESSMENT
      1-10. The potential for U.S. forces to encounter a CBRN incident in the OE remains a serious challenge.
      This threat can come from nation states and nonstate actors alike, sometimes simultaneously, and may
      occur in a variety of forms. These include deliberate attacks or accidental releases.

OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT
   1-11. The OE includes system variables and mission variables, PMESII, and to these variables USA
   doctrine adds two more: physical environment and time (PMESII-PT). Each set is useful to the Services at
   different echelons of command. These variables affect the manner in which multi-Service forces combine,
   sequence, and conduct military operations. Commanders tailor forces, employ diverse capabilities, and
   support different missions to succeed in this complex OE. (For a more in-depth discussion of the OE
   variables, see Field Manual [FM] 3-0.)

CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT
   1-12. Capability assessment is a process used to help identify and control resources and determine when
   and where to employ various CBRN capabilities across the full spectrum of missions, functions, operations,
   and activities.

VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
   1-13. Vulnerabilities are characteristics of an installation, unit, activity, port, ship, residence, facility, or
   other site requiring consideration for improvement to withstand, mitigate, or deter against CBRN threats
   and hazards. When improvements are not made, a risk-based approach to defense and protection activities
   must be undertaken. The primary focus is to identify threats and hazards critical to the success of the
   mission. (See chapter 2 for CBRN assessment activities.)
   1-14. Planning is based on initial CBRN assessments and enables the commander and battle staff to
   identify minimum standards for training, organizing, equipping, and protecting resources. (See chapter 3
   for CBRN planning activities.) Collaborative planning for CBRN actions ensures the preparedness and
   readiness of forces, adequate CBRN force allocation, and timely response and mitigation. The plan drives
   preparation and facilitates CBRN defense operations. Collaborative planning includes—
             Ensuring that planners and staffs have access to planning tools, data repositories, and automated
              resources necessary to perform planning functions.
             Planning for far-term contingencies, future and current operations, exercises, and training.
   1-15. Preparation implements the approved plan and relevant agreements to increase readiness through
   training, exercises, and certification. The initiation of the CBRN intelligence, surveillance, and
   reconnaissance (ISR) plan is a key preparation activity to support the commander’s critical information
   requirements (CCIR). Other key activities include implementing vulnerability reduction measures,
   conducting necessary movement, and conducting rehearsals. Interoperability is a key component of the
   integration and connectivity of preparation activities and includes ensuring access to or availability of the
   appropriate CBRN-related information technology. (See chapter 4 for CBRN preparation activities.)
   1-16. CBRN execution activities should focus the commander and battle staff on continued CCIR and
   allow the collection of relevant information and intelligence to support decisions. (See chapter 5 for CBRN
   execution activities.) Decision support systems used must be interoperable, flexible, responsive, mobile,
   disciplined, survivable, and sustainable. CBRN execution activities may include CBRN—
             Active and passive protection (incident prevention).
             Incident response.
             Hazard prediction, modeling, warning, and reporting.
             Incident mitigation.
             Resource allocation, to include—
                  Reconnaissance.
                  Surveillance.
                  Protection.
                  Decontamination.
                  Casualty processing.

      shape function is representative of the CBRN aspects of C2 for all echelons among the Services.
      1-18. Commanders and CBRN staffs synchronize the CBRN assessment activities—threat, operational
      environment, capabilities, and vulnerabilities—through the CBRN operations process. The key activities of
      the CBRN operations process, as shown in figure 1-2, page 1-4, are—
              Continuous assessment.
              Planning.
              Preparation.
              Execution.

         Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear
                     Assessment Activities
       This chapter addresses key CBRN assessment activities that commanders use to
       measure warfighter progress toward mission accomplishment and compare the results
       to their initial vision and commander’s intent.

FUNCTIONS
   2-1. CBRN C2 functions have a defined set of passive defense capabilities—CBRN shape, CBRN sense,
   CBRN shield, and CBRN sustain—that frame the discussion, assessment, and management of CBRN
   defense operations. Their definitions are as follows:
            CBRN shape. The ability to—
                 Characterize the CBRN hazard to the force commander.
                 Develop a clear understanding of the current and predicted CBRN situation.
                 Collect and assimilate information from sensors, intelligence, health, and surveillance in
                  near real time to inform personnel.
                 Provide actual and potential impacts of CBRN threats and hazards.
                 Envision critical CBRN sense, CBRN shield, and CBRN sustain end states (preparation for
                  operations).
                 Visualize the sequence of events that moves the force from its current state to those end
                  states.
            CBRN sense. The capability to continually provide information about the CBRN situation at a
             time and place by detecting, identifying, and quantifying CBRN hazards in air, in water, and on
             land, personnel, equipment, and facilities. This capability includes detecting, identifying, and
             quantifying those CBRN hazards in all physical states (solid, liquid, and gas).
            CBRN shield. The capability to shield the force from harm caused by CBRN hazards by
             preventing or reducing individual and collective exposures, applying prophylaxes to prevent or
             mitigate negative physiological effects, and protecting critical equipment.
            CBRN sustain. The ability to conduct decontamination and medical actions that enable the
             quick restoration of combat power, maintain/recover essential functions that are free from the
             effects of CBRN hazards, and facilitate the return to preincident operational capability as soon as
             possible.
   2-2. CBRN assessment, as a shape capability, is the continuous monitoring and evaluation of the current
   situation and the progress of an operation. CBRN assessments involve deliberately comparing actual events
   to forecasted outcomes to determine the overall effectiveness of force employment. Commanders and staffs
   monitor the situation and evaluate operation progress to determine if the current order is still valid or if
   there are better ways to achieve the end state. Assessments form the foundation of staff running estimates
   and assist commanders in maintaining an accurate situational understanding of their specific area of
   operations (AO) and revising their visualization as needed. The key assessments are—
             Threat assessment (intelligence preparation of the operational environment [IPOE] and
              intelligence preparation of the battlefield [IPB]).
             OE assessment (PMESII-PT/PMESII and METT-TC/METT-T).
             Capability assessment (personnel, units, equipment, networks, and logistics).
             Vulnerability assessment (analysis and reduction).

Chapter 2



THREAT
      2-3. When designing operations, commanders and staffs analyze the CBRN threat to gain an in-depth
      understanding that considers more than just enemy military capabilities, order of battle, and tactics. CBRN
      threats and hazards can range from adversarial actions to man-made incidents or accidents to natural
      disasters. Target accessibility and vulnerability are additional variables in terms of the adversary’s
      perceived net payoff and assessment of target opportunities and outcomes. During threat assessment, the
      CBRN staff assesses the enemy—
                Type and composition (CBRN-capable units) in the AO and area of interest (AOI).
                Disposition (C2 posts and threat training status).
                Capabilities (ranges and effectiveness of CBRN delivery systems, types of CBRN weapons
                 available, and CBRN protective and detection equipment available).
                Intent (national policy and CBRN employment doctrine).

            Note. This assessment will estimate how threat forces prefer to conduct operations under ideal
            conditions. A nuclear-capable threat may base employment on the weapon type, yield, and
            delivery systems available. How the enemy employs biological weapons will also depend on
            similar factors—usually, the type of agent and delivery system available. Enemy chemical
            employment can also be identified by the type of agent and delivery system. However, the use of
            chemical, nuclear, or radiological weapons could also be classified into three groups: terrain-
            oriented, force-oriented, or a combination of the two. (A terrain-oriented threat will attempt to
            use these agents to restrict terrain or shape the OE, and a force-oriented threat directly targets
            personnel concentrations. Biological agents would likely be used against personnel.)

      2-4. The threat assessment should address the types of agents and hazards within an area of responsibility
      (AOR). Additionally, the unit should expect to receive information on potential storage or production
      facilities in the vicinity and methods that could be used to deliver CBRN agents or materials. Estimates
      may also be furnished on when, where, and how agents or materials may be used. Based on that type of
      input, the unit can consider relevant factors (terrain, weather). Higher headquarters guidance may also
      provide information on previous incidents and the current threat level as established in the AOR. Threat
      assessments are required if a deliberate adversarial capability, opportunity, or intent exist.

ADVERSARIAL CAPABILITY
      2-5. An adversary’s capability to carry out a specific type of threat activity is assessed based on their
      capability to design, develop, or deliver the resources (weapon systems) used in that activity. Assessment
      information can come from intelligence sources on CBRN threats and hazards within the AOI. For
      example, a vast array of TIM facilities may exist in the AO or near the AO. Further, assessment of an
      adversary capability involves several factors that require more specifics and may generate an intelligence
      collection plan. Risk is measured when conducting assessments of the possibility of third-power
      intervention with CBRN weapons on the behalf of an adversary or the weaponization of a CBR agent or
      material, which could occur on a very rudimentary basis with an improvised dissemination device
      (handheld spray devices).

ADVERSARIAL OPPORTUNITY
      2-6. An adversary’s opportunity to carry out an attack is assessed against particular targets and the type of
      weapons or systems required for effective use against a target. Planners consider the weather, terrain,
      installation boundaries, defensive posture, and other factors to assess when or where an adversary may
      attack. An assessment of how an adversary will attack considers the objective and means of delivery. An
      adversary may attack using overt or covert systems against operational-level targets:
                 Overt systems include aircraft, cruise missiles, unmanned aircraft systems/remotely piloted
                  vehicles, tactical ballistic missiles, and small boats.
                 Covert releases include various aerosol-releasing devices, contamination of drinking water, and
                  improvised CBRN devices.

                                    Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Assessment Activities



ADVERSARIAL INTENT
   2-7. An adversary’s goals, purpose, or aims, including the decisions required and means to achieve those
   goals, are assessed in terms of desired targets and effects. Planners conduct an assessment of adversary
   intent to use CBRN weapons or TIM. Adversary intent may be to cause casualties, contamination,
   degradation, or panic or to demonstrate its ability to attack anywhere at any time.
   2-8. Thorough threat assessments allow commanders to tailor their CBRN intelligence capabilities to fit
   mission requirements. Success in these operations requires multidisciplined, all-source, fused intelligence
   because a single-source approach cannot support all CBRN intelligence requirements. Thorough mission
   analysis allows commanders to tailor their CBRN intelligence capabilities to fit mission requirements.
   Commanders adapt tactically to select the intelligence capabilities needed. They often use human
   intelligence and counterintelligence.
   2-9. In each phase of the intelligence process, CBRN considerations must be handled in ways that do not
   fit neatly into the patterns used for other forms of intelligence support. The tactical employment of military
   forces examines the arrangement of the forces and efforts in time, space, and purpose (prioritizing the
   deployment of resources and ensuring the presence of a required infrastructure). Based on the IPOE/IPB,
   the CBRN staffs anticipate what may occur within the AO and conduct coordination, as required.
   2-10. IPOE/IPB is a key tool for assessing the enemy situation, physical environment, and civil
   considerations. It begins during planning and continues during operations process activities. The
   continuous IPOE/IPB process must account for confirmed and plausible, adversary capabilities, plans, and
   actions. Adversary CBRN capabilities may result from research and development or the acquisition of
   readily usable CBRN capabilities from other countries or nonstate actors. Commanders must take into
   account these potential adversaries’ CBRN capabilities in assessments, estimates, and plans.
   2-11. The IPOE/IPB process must address the capabilities and limitations of adversary CBRN weapons
   and delivery systems; their command, control, and release procedures; the indicators of intent to employ
   CBRN weapons; and the possibility of direct or accidental release of TIM. IPOE/IPB remains the same for
   all types of military operations; however, its focus may change depending on the predominant type of
   operation or primary unit focus. Products required to portray the information may also change based on the
   type of operation. For example, threat and situation templates used to portray conventional threats differ
   from those used to portray asymmetric threats. In addition, civil considerations have assumed an
   importance on a par with the enemy and other conditions of the OE for all types of operations. IPOE/IPB
   products must provide enough detail for commanders and staffs to make informed decisions.
   2-12. The intelligence staff officer’s IPOE/IPB should focus on more than military capabilities and include
   information and analysis of OE variables. IPOE/IPB is designed to reduce the commander’s uncertainties
   concerning weather, enemy, and terrain for a specific geographic area. It analyzes the intelligence database
   in detail to determine the impact of enemy, weather, and terrain on the operation and presents this
   information in graphic format. The IPOE/IPB enables the commander to see the battlefield—where friendly
   and enemy forces can move, shoot, and communicate; where critical areas lie; and where enemy forces
   (and his/her own) are most vulnerable. IPOE/IPB guides the intelligence staff officer (S-2) in determining
   where and when to employ collection assets to detect or deny enemy activities. These assets, working
   collectively, fulfill intelligence requirements and answer the priority intelligence requirements. IPOE/IPB is
   the key for preparing for battle. It is a continuous process that supports planning and execution for
   operations.

OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT
   2-13. Command staffs strive to provide a perspective of the interrelated variables that make up their
   specific OE. An OE is a composite of the conditions, circumstances, and influences that affect the
   employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander. A thorough assessment of the OE
   includes a detailed analysis of the various CBRN threats and hazards. However, for purposes of this
   publication, the threat assessment is addressed separately due to its complex nature and criticality to the
   CBRN operations process.




28 February 2011        ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                                2-3
Chapter 2



      2-14. CBRN threats and hazards consist of complex, evolving, and adaptive systems that extend beyond
      the domain of historical operations. Joint doctrine defines a system as a functionally, physically, and/or
      behaviorally related group of regularly interacting or interdependent elements—that group of elements
      forming a unified whole. While Service forces may not adopt the joint systems analysis of the OE,
      commanders and staffs must understand this aspect of joint doctrine when participating in joint operation
      planning or assessment.
      2-15. Commander estimates, staff estimates, and collaborative information sharing help commanders
      continue to refine and deepen their situational understanding of the OE. Estimates may require a constant
      reexamination of the OE that adopts a broader perspective of the situation, problems, and local challenges
      within the unit AO. In multi-Service doctrine, major variables that commanders and staffs at all levels
      should consider using for estimating and analyzing OE information are PMESII/PMESII-PT. During
      mission analysis at the tactical level, commanders and staffs can draw most of the relevant information
      needed for mission analysis from the more comprehensive PMESII/PMESII-PT analysis of their OE, using
      the factors of METT-TC (USA) or METT-T (USMC).
      2-16. Commanders and staffs continuously analyze their OE and the progress of operations, comparing
      them to the commander’s initial vision and intent. Understanding these variables, their interaction with
      each other, and how relationships among the variables change over time helps commanders and staffs
      realize how the effects of CBRN threats and hazards on one or more variables can affect their OE.
      Assessing the specific OE consists of—
               Monitoring the current situation and the progress of operations.
               Evaluating the operation against criteria for success.

CAPABILITY
      2-17. Commanders conduct the CBRN capability assessment continuously during the operations cycle in
      determining how to employ forces and equipment in a CBRN environment. The capability assessment is a
      comparison of current unit CBRN abilities, to include the proficiency of individual CBRN staff officers,
      command posts, cells, and elements, with the proficiency and resources required to support the commander
      during full spectrum operations. It involves the continuous assessment of unit plans, organization,
      manpower, equipment, logistics, training, leadership, infrastructure, and facilities, and readiness.
      2-18. The following list provides a representative sampling of various CBRN-related capabilities that
      require continuous assessment:
                CBRN units.
                CBRN staffs.
                CBRN equipment.
                CBRN reconnaissance and surveillance (Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for
                 Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance).
                Collective protection (Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological,
                 and Chemical [NBC] Protection).
                Decontamination.
                Automated warning and reporting (JWARN).
                Hazard prediction and modeling (JWARN/Joint effects model [JEM]).
                Preventive medicine (FM 4-02.7).
                Casualty management (FM 4-02.7).
                Laboratories (FM 4-02.7).
                Technical escort (FM 3-11.20).
                Incident/hazard risks.

                                    Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Assessment Activities



VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
   2-19. CBRN vulnerability assessments are essential to force protection (FP) planning. They provide the
   commander a tool to determine the potential vulnerability of an installation, unit, activity, port, ship,
   residence, facility, or other site against CBRN threats and hazards. The CBRN vulnerability assessment
   identifies functions or activities that are vulnerable to threats and require attention from C2 authorities to
   address improvement to withstand, mitigate, or deter against the threat. When improvements cannot be
   made, a risk-based approach to defense and protection activities must be undertaken.
   2-20. The CBRN vulnerability assessment compiles the other types of assessments discussed into an
   overall snapshot of unit ability to support or conduct an operation given the specific OE and unit
   capabilities. (See figure 2-1 for an illustration of the vulnerability assessment process.)




                            Figure 2-1. Vulnerability assessment process

   2-21. The CBRN vulnerability assessment will—
            Indicate what the vulnerabilities are.
            Determine the likelihood that CBRN threats or hazards will exploit a given vulnerability based
             on knowledge, technologies, resources, probability of detection, and payoff.
            Predict the potential impact to the AO if the vulnerability is exploited.
   2-22. CBRN vulnerability assessments require a comparison of the threat with unit vulnerabilities to
   determine the efforts necessary to safely meet incident requirements. A vulnerability assessment also
   includes the integration of the commander’s guidance through a risk management process to prioritize the
   implementation of vulnerability reduction measures.
   2-23. Given the factors in the risk equation and the cost of implementing countermeasures, a determination
   may be made that the risk potential of a given vulnerability is not worth the cost of correcting or
   implementing a CBRN defensive countermeasure. (See appendix B for CBRN vulnerability assessments.)

 Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Planning
                        Activities
       Planning is the process by which commanders (and staff, if available) translate the
       commander’s visualization into a specific course of action (COA) for preparation and
       execution, focusing on the expected results. Planning begins with the analysis and
       assessment of the situation to comprehend the relationship of the factors of METT-
       TC/METT-T. It involves understanding and framing the problem and envisioning the
       set of conditions that represent the desired end state. Based on the commander’s
       guidance, planning includes formulating one or more supportable COAs to
       accomplish the mission. The basic planning process for CBRN operations remains
       the same across the full spectrum of military operations and should ensure the
       integration of CBRN considerations into the decisionmaking processes. At the
       tactical level, CBRN planning takes plans and estimates at the strategic and
       operational levels into account. One of the key facets of plans for CBRN operations,
       given the large variety of potential agents and weapons, is to limit the agents and
       weapons under consideration to those most likely to be employed during the time
       period being addressed. Planning must—
                Involve a detailed, systematic analysis to produce an optimal COA; or
                 conversely, planning may be a rapid process that reaches an acceptable
                 COA quickly by considering only critical aspects of the problem.
                Facilitate establishing or maintaining the tempo that the commander desires.
                Help to ensure the proper placement of CBRN assets in-theater before a
                 crisis or conflict and in the time-phased force and deployment sequence
                 prepared to support movement to the theater. In particular, the commander
                 should be cognizant of significant shortfalls in the capability or availability
                 of CBRN assets.
                Focus on ensuring that commanders can accomplish their mission-essential
                 tasks in CBRN environments.
PLANNING PROCESSES
   3-1. The commander, CBRN staff officer, unit leader, or section leader must provide specific CBRN
   threat and hazard information during a deliberate planning process. The purpose of this guidance is not to
   replace Service guidance, but to highlight some CBRN-related considerations of the planning process that
   apply to staffs, units, and sections during operations.
   3-2. Planning is a process that integrates the activities of the commander, staff, and subordinate
   commanders in developing a series of products that are needed to execute the CBRN operation. These
   products include updated staff estimates, intelligence products, and control measures. The application of
   planning processes matures CBRN vulnerability assessments and casualty estimates into decision briefings
   and published CBRN action plans.
   3-3. The planning process establishes appropriate command, planning, and operational relationships and
   ensures that vulnerabilities do not compromise U.S. forces or missions. Whether done at the strategic,
   operational, or tactical level, the key functions of planning are to—
             Direct and coordinate active and passive CBRN actions.
             Develop a shared SA of the AO.


28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                             3-1
Chapter 3



               Generate common expectations about how action evolves and how it will affect the desired
                outcome.
               Support the exercise of initiative.
               Shape the thinking of planners.
               Identify, assess, and estimate adversary CBRN capabilities, intentions, and most likely COAs
                based on the situation.
               Provide recommendations for the commander’s planning guidance to help ensure that forces and
                facilities are prepared to operate in CBRN environments.
      3-4. CBRN planning involves conducting assessments of the OE, CBRN threats and hazards, CBRN
      vulnerabilities, CBRN capabilities, and risk. Additionally, the IPOE/IPB, targeting, and ISR processes are
      integrated into the decisionmaking process. The unit uses the method its Service normally uses to plan
      missions. Two of these methods are the MDMP and the MCPP. (See figure 3-1 for a comparative depiction
      of the planning processes.)

      3-5. Planning CBRN and support actions are integral components of full spectrum operations.
      Commanders direct operations and synchronize the warfighting functions through plans and orders.
      Planners should always—
               Focus on the threat.
               Identify the phases or steps required to achieve the vision.


3-2                       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1              28 February 2011
                                      Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Planning Activities



            Assign objectives and CBRN vulnerability reduction measures to each phase.
            Identify the main and supporting CBRN vulnerability reduction measures in each phase.
            Assign resource priorities in each phase.
            Identify indicators of success to monitor the progress of the commander’s planning guidance.
            Assess the readiness to respond to CBRN events.
   3-6. Commanders must provide sufficient planning guidance for their staffs to develop estimates and
   feasible COAs as they relate to and support CBRN operations. To make the guidance more meaningful, the
   commander should also provide his/her vision of the operation to the staff. The following elements must be
   included:
            Threat COAs.
            Friendly COAs.
            Restated mission.
            Commander’s intent.
            Deception objective.
            Priorities.
            Time plan (produced from the analyses of available time conducted by the commander and
             staff).
            Type of order to issue.
            Type of rehearsal to conduct.
   3-7. Regardless of the amount of commander’s guidance provided, the CBRN staff must be prepared to
   receive and retain the details. A common mistake made by commanders is assuming that the CBRN staff
   understands their planning guidance when, in fact, they do not.
   3-8. The commander’s planning guidance should consider the entire AO, and it should address ways to
   enhance the protection of friendly forces and maximize combat power. (See appendix C for planning
   process considerations as they relate to CBRN operations.)

ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES
   3-9. CBRN planning support to decisionmaking is dynamic and continuous. However, it must also be
   preplanned in the sense that extensive CBRN threat, OE, capability, and vulnerability assessments must be
   completed early enough to be factored into the commander’s decisionmaking effort. The goal of the
   assessment process is to achieve the level of protection sought through the implementation of mitigation
   measures. (See appendix D for threat assessment checklists.)
   3-10. During the planning phase of the operations process, the CBRN threat or hazard is identified,
   defined, and quantified to provide information for ISR planning and potential target nominations. The
   CBRN staff should gather information about adversary capabilities, opportunities, and intent and begin
   coordination with the intelligence section to—
             Identify CBRN-related intelligence gaps and initiate actions to fill them (use the previously
              developed knowledge base and begin new intelligence collection operations).
             Determine CBRN-related gaps in the priority intelligence requirements, and add them to the
              collection plan.
             Update threat models with the CBRN-related data that has been collected.
             Convert threat doctrine into a doctrinal template.
             Describe the threat CBRN-related tactics and options.
             Identify high-value targets that may be targeted by CBRN weapons.
             Identify threat CBRN capabilities.

Chapter 3



      3-11. IPOE/IPB provides a systematic, continuous process for analyzing the threat and other conditions of
      the OE, which include terrain, weather, and civil considerations. IPOE/IPB supports the commander’s
      visualization, staff estimates, and the planning process. It takes a well-trained staff to successfully perform
      IPOE/IPB. During the planning phase, IPOE/IPB—
                Defines the OE.
                Describes the OE effects.
                Produces an evaluation of the threat.
                Develops possible enemy COAs.
      3-12. An OE assessment provides the unit commander with information on the major CBRN systems,
      friendly and adversary CBRN capabilities, vulnerabilities, threats, and physical characteristics and the
      political environment. The CBRN staff addresses the effects of weather and terrain on CBRN operations in
      the AO/AOI (soil type, surface drainage, vegetation type and distribution, precipitation, wind patterns,
      temperature, humidity, cloud cover, topography). These variables affect agent and radiation persistency and
      effectiveness and the extent of possible contamination areas. The CBRN staff must also consider these
      variables for hazard prediction and reduction measures (decontamination). Most of this information can be
      determined through a map analysis supplemented by reconnaissance (chemical, aerial, military intelligence,
      or scout assets), a chemical downwind message, effective downwind message, and supporting weather
      elements.
      3-13. During the planning phase, the consideration of operational variables can lead to the identification of
      key CBRN-related nodes, links, and vulnerabilities. When the adversary is a state actor, the variables will
      be present, with many of them possessing tangible infrastructure that is easily identified by ISR. When the
      adversary is a nonstate actor, these same variables will be present to varying degrees. Nonstate actors are
      organized in a fundamentally different way than states actor, and they manifest themselves in completely
      different ways. However, the PMESII/PMESII-PT framework for analysis applies to OEs involving state
      actors, nonstate actors, or both. (See appendix E for CBRN considerations as they relate to
      PMESII/PMESII-PT.)
      3-14. Drawing from the variables of PMESII/PMESII-PT, the factors of METT-TC/METT-T serve as a
      standard format for the identification of CBRN threats and hazards at the tactical level. The variables of
      METT-TC are used because they are institutionalized in the USA through its professional military
      education and initial-entry training systems. The USMC and joint doctrine use the term METT-T; civil
      considerations are inherently measured within the context of this acronym. METT-TC/METT-T is
      primarily used as part of the USA MDMP and USMC MCPP for tactical missions. However, the same
      thought process is equally effective when considering nontactical operations and the off-duty environment.
      (See appendix E for CBRN considerations as they relate to the factors of METT-TC and METT-T.)
      3-15. Friendly force organizations, manpower, equipment, logistics, training, leadership, infrastructure,
      facilities, and readiness are continuously monitored and updated based on the CBRN threat and OE
      assessments. During the planning phase, the commander and CBRN staff consider the following:
                 Equipment adequacy and the training of nonmilitary and non-U.S. logistics personnel to survive
                  and operate in an environment containing CBRN threats and hazards.
                 Whether forces and facilities are prepared to operate in CBRN environments, taking due account
                  of the civilian population and key host nation (HN) AOIs.
                 CONOPS and procedures associated with operating on fixed installations (aerial ports of
                  debarkation [APODs], seaports of debarkation [SPODs]).
                 Whether critical logistics throughput and transportation facilities receive adequate protection.
                 Whether plans, training, and equipment are in place for the rapid restoration of operations after
                  an attack.
                 Coordination actions to ensure that adequately integrated relationships are established between
                  separate organizations located in the same area.

            Note. See appendix C for planning processes.

   3-16. The commander establishes and implements a deliberate process for assessing the vulnerability of
   manpower, facilities, and materiel to a CBRN attack. This process will integrate offensive and defensive
   capabilities to reduce the threat of CBRN use and sustain operations if attacks occur. The process will also
   include executing mitigation and restoration plans to reduce the operational impact of CBRN
   contamination.
   3-17. Assessment tasks take different forms during planning, preparation, and execution. During planning,
   assessments allow commanders and CBRN staffs to establish initial criteria for evaluating success, assess
   the situation in terms of expectations developed during the COA analysis, and evaluate the progress of the
   plan throughout the operations cycle. Throughout the process, IPOE/IPB and continuous updates are key
   tools for assessing the enemy situation and the AO. This means that assessment measures and collection
   means have to be understood. (See table 3-1 for more information on operations process assessment tasks.)

   facilitate the decisionmaking processes.

AUTOMATED PLANNING TOOLS
   3-19. Automated planning tools use tactical unit level and installation resources to obtain and assess
   environmental background data (including climatology) for potential CBRN implications. These
   capabilities facilitate warning and alarming personnel potentially affected by the CBRN threats and hazards
   in time to assume protective posture. (See appendix F for automated planning tools.)

      3-20. The warfighter needs planning and early warning intelligence for tactical planning and response to
      incoming threats. JWARN and JEM (which is an emerging capability to begin fielding in fiscal year 2009),
      when used as planning capabilities, provide commanders and their CBRN staff with preincident and
      predictive modeling.
      3-21. JWARN will reside in C2 centers at the echelon levels defined by the Services and enable CBRN
      defense specialists and other designated personnel to update the COP with CBRN-related information.
      JWARN operators will develop likely CBRN attack scenarios reflecting the capabilities of adversary
      forces. Analyzing these scenarios in JWARN as part of current operation (near-term) planning will allow
      the JWARN operator to recommend the positioning of CBRN sensors, pre-positioning of CBRN equipment
      and consumables, and modification of JEM templates so that high-fidelity hazard predictions better reflect
      the potential capabilities of adversary forces.
      3-22. Information from the JWARN analysis of likely CBRN scenarios will support decisionmaking at the
      tactical level of warfare by increasing the timeliness and accuracy of CBRN warning and reporting.
      Increased SA will allow the commander to identify and warn units at risk, identify where CBRN units and
      equipment should move, deploy CBRN reconnaissance teams, and provide CBRN route information to
      friendly forces. (See appendix F for Service-specific CONOPS for JWARN.)

INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE
PLANNING
      3-23. ISR is an integral part of the warfighting mission. The commander and staff deploy reconnaissance
      assets early in the planning process to facilitate early collection. The information collected is analyzed and
      incorporated into the planning process. The ISR plan is not a military intelligence specific product and is
      often the most important source for information and intelligence that contributes to answering CBRN-
      specific CCIRs.
      3-24. The ISR plan is the fusion point for synchronizing intelligence collection to produce information
      requirements related to the AO and CBRN threats and hazards. Making the most effective use of available
      information and collection assets requires managing these requirements. The intelligence synchronization
      process ensures that the CBRN staff section or collection asset is tasked to collect the required information.
      It also ensures that the optimal collector is tasked and the highest priorities are satisfied first.
      3-25. Commanders integrate CBRN reconnaissance missions and surveillance means to contribute to an
      integrated ISR plan that capitalizes on their different capabilities. Reconnaissance is often the most
      important part of this activity, providing data that contributes to answering the CCIRs. As such,
      commanders conduct it with the same care as any other operation. They normally initiate reconnaissance
      operations before completing the plan. In fact, information on which the final plan is based is often
      gathered during reconnaissance operations.
      3-26. It is critical that the reconnaissance unit leaders ensure that available assets are integrated into the
      reconnaissance and surveillance plan. In addition, they must ensure that the reconnaissance plan is
      synchronized with their sustainment, communications, and medical evacuation plans.
      3-27. The quality of available information and intelligence significantly influences the ability to produce a
      viable CBRN action plan. The more intelligence available, the better the commander and staff can plan.
      Less information means that the commander has a greater chance of making a poor decision. (See
      Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance.)

TARGETING PROCESS
      3-28. The targeting process has CBRN implications when units conduct deliberate target assessments as
      part of IPOE/IPB and prepare “target folders” for each site assessed. Pertinent information collected by the
      units for each target is maintained in the target folder for use in a future response. Information could
      include floor plans, site maps, routes in and out, potential staging areas, and a determination of prevailing
      winds to produce downwind hazard predictions. Commanders and CBRN staffs use these target folders to
      facilitate the development of response plans and CBRN vulnerability reduction measures and war-game

   how they would respond if a WMD-sensitive site was discovered or if a CBRN-related incident occurred.
   (See table 3-2 for suggested target folder content [there is no standard format for these folders].)

             Site overview              Site significance

             Simulation analysis        Collection strategies
             Agent data                 Additional site exploitation
             Background information     Command guidance
             Graphics                   Transportation
             Drawings                   Roads
             Maps                       Analyst comments
             Photos                     Projects and agents
             Building plans

   3-29. According to JP 1-02, a target is an entity or object considered for possible engagement or other
   action. Targets also include the wide array of mobile and stationary forces, equipment, capabilities, and
   functions that an enemy commander can use to conduct operations. Target development, also called
   targeting, is the process of selecting targets and matching the appropriate response to them on the basis of
   operational requirements, capabilities, and limitations.
   3-30. The targeting process supports offensive operations and WMD elimination mission sets for
   combating WMD—the emphasis of targeting is to identify resources (targets) that the enemy can least
   afford to lose or that provide the greatest advantage and then identify the subset of those targets that must
   be acquired and attacked to achieve friendly success. Denying these resources to the enemy makes him/her
   vulnerable to friendly battle plans. These resources constitute critical enemy vulnerabilities. Successful
   targeting enables the commander to synchronize intelligence, maneuver, fire support systems, and special
   operations forces by attacking the right target with the best system and munitions at the right time.
   3-31. Targeting is an integral part of the planning and decisionmaking processes. The operational-level
   commander relies on his/her tactical-level commanders to effectively orchestrate the targeting process. The
   operational commander best influences the outcome of future tactical battles by setting the conditions for
   those battles and allocating resources to Service components. The targeting process is accomplished by the
   components applying Service-developed TTP within a joint framework established by the commander.

HEALTH SERVICE SUPPORT
   3-32. The medical planner is responsible for planning and coordinating HSS. The complexity of medical
   planning and execution requires full-time attention from a qualified medical planner. Medical
   considerations can adversely affect operational and tactical operations because of unique mission
   requirements and the environment that CBRN threats and hazards create. Nonmedical staffs cannot provide
   the commander with the same support as a dedicated medical planner. (See Department of Defense
   Instruction (DODI) 6200.03 for details on the assignment of public health emergency officers for DOD
   installations.)
   3-33. The medical planner should understand the capabilities and limitations of the medical assets when
   planning HSS throughout the AO. Without collective protection, medical assets will be unable to treat
   casualties in chemically contaminated environments and may suffer operational degradation in radiological
   or biological environments.




28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                                3-7
Chapter 3



      3-34. When a CBRN attack occurs on or near the AOR, the medical planner must be prepared to quickly
      and efficiently transition from planning for conventional casualty operations to conducting contaminated
      casualty operations. For this information to be obtained quickly, a medical planner must be located in the
      unit tactical operations center. He/she must monitor the unit internal command radio net and/or the
      administration/logistics radio net.
      3-35. Successful CBRN attacks may produce mass casualty events. When medical CONOPS are
      developed, planners must consider the risk of CBRN threats and hazards and the increased burden on
      medical infrastructure. The medical laydown and CONOPS for CBRN threats and hazards should be
      seamless and consistent with non-CBRN CONOPS to the extent possible. The same building block
      approach should be used, where medical CBRN-specific assets are laid over conventional medical assets.
      The flow of these assets into the theater must be driven by the mission needs of the joint force commander
      and relative health threats.
      3-36. The joint tool approved for calculating medical requirements is the joint medical analysis tool.
      Currently, the joint medical analysis tool does not include the capability to generate medical requirements
      for CBRN casualties. However, the Defense Medical Standardization Board is developing task, time, and
      treater files for use with the joint medical analysis tool for various CBRN casualty profiles. These files can
      be used to determine Class VIII equipment and supply requirements. The Services are responsible for
      generating casualty estimates and tracking casualty rates for contingency operations.

         Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear
                     Preparation Activities
       This chapter examines CBRN preparation measures and stresses the importance of
       key logistics, education, training, rehearsal, exercise, and HSS considerations.
       Preparation requires the steady infusion of new operational TTP, CONOPS, and
       standardized leadership protocols. CBRN preparation includes those activities
       undertaken by the unit before execution to improve its ability to conduct the
       operation. Preparation includes plan refinement, rehearsals, reconnaissance,
       coordination, inspections, and movement. When not executing CBRN operations,
       commanders prepare their forces for CBRN operations. These preparations include
       training and maintaining personnel and CBRN equipment. Preparation for a specific
       operation starts with the receipt of a warning order and ends when execution begins.
       CBRN staffs focus on monitoring and determining changes in friendly forces’ CBRN
       readiness status and their ability to execute the operation. Preparation is an ongoing
       process that overlaps the planning and execution phases. Preparation is evaluated
       against the commander’s criteria for success that is established during planning to
       determine variances and forecast the significance of those variances to mission
       success. Estimates begun during planning continue, enabling commanders and staff
       to understand the factors of METT-T and METT-TC in relation to each other and
       their impact on the end state. These estimates, usually drawing relevant information
       from a more comprehensive analysis of the specific OE using the PMESII/PMESII-
       PT variables, facilitate an accurate understanding of the OE and contribute to
       updating and refining the plan. New orders are issued to modify subordinates’
       mission tasks, if necessary, as commanders continue their visualization. During
       preparation, CBRN staffs continue to update and refine products developed during
       planning. IPOE/IPB focuses on providing an updated picture of the OE and the
       CBRN threats and hazards based on new information gathered through collection and
       friendly reporting. Staffs also ensure that these products are available and
       disseminated to subordinate units, which often do not have the resources available to
       higher headquarters. CBRN preparation consists of the following activities, which
       involve actions by commanders, staffs, units, and Service members:
               ISR operations.
               Assessments.
               Task organization.
               Movement.
               Coordination and liaison.
               Logistics.
               Education.
               Training.
               Rehearsals.
               Exercises.
               HSS.

Chapter 4



INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE
OPERATIONS
      4-1. ISR operations commence simultaneously with other preparation activities so that the commander
      can improve situational understanding about an adversary and other conditions of the AO and apply
      vulnerability reduction measures before executing major operations. Commanders typically employ CBRN
      reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities in advance of other capabilities to provide warning and protect
      personnel, equipment, and other key assets from the adverse effects of CBRN hazards. CBRN
      reconnaissance and surveillance operations continue concurrently with other preparation and execution
      activities according to the collection plan.
      4-2. CBRN reconnaissance and surveillance constitute intelligence collection efforts to answer CCIR and
      set the conditions to execute military operations while preventing adverse effects from CBRN hazards.
      Adverse effects are prevented by preventing the employment/release of CBRN material or avoiding
      contamination if a CBRN incident occurs. Contamination can be avoided by determining the extent of
      contamination and/or establishing a bypass route through the contaminated area. This collection effort
      supports commanders’ decision points throughout an operation. Timely and accurate intelligence of CBRN
      threats and hazards encourages audacity and facilitates actions that may negate enemy superiority in
      personnel and materiel.
      4-3. CBRN reconnaissance and surveillance are not static, single efforts that accomplish a task and stop.
      As reconnaissance forces collect information, the staff modifies the collection plan to account for new
      information and redirect ISR efforts. Commanders and staffs continuously review intelligence products and
      synchronize their CBRN reconnaissance and surveillance efforts within the overall ISR plan. They focus on
      the most critical vulnerabilities, emphasizing the established or revised CCIRs. Commanders balance the
      following factors against their need for relevant information:
                The ability of CBRN reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities to gather the information.
                The acceptable risk to these assets during the collection of information and samples.
                The ability to sustain the CBRN reconnaissance and surveillance effort over time.
                The requirement to have CBRN reconnaissance and surveillance assets available at critical times
                 and places.
      4-4. The result of the above is a continuous feed of relevant information that facilitates the commander’s
      situational understanding and, ultimately, supports his/her key decision points for the overall operation.

THREAT ASSESSMENT
      4-5. During the preparation phase of the operations process, the CBRN threat or hazard is already
      identified, defined, and quantified. The threat includes those aggressors (people or groups) that are known
      to exist and have the capability and a history or expressed intention of using hostile actions against
      potential targets that are identified in the plan. The threat also includes aggressors who are, according to
      current credible intelligence information, conducting targeting activity (surveillance of potential targets) or
      preparing for intentional acts. The CBRN staff should evaluate whether adversary capabilities,
      opportunities, or intent have changed or remain the same. Checklists for continuously evaluating and
      updating threat assessments are key tools in the preparation phase. (See appendix D for threat assessment
      checklists.)

OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT
      4-6. An updated picture of the OE and CBRN threats and hazards is developed based on new information
      gathered through continuous collection and friendly reporting during IPOE/IPB. This ongoing assessment
      during the preparation phase helps refine and deepen the commander’s situational understanding of the OE
      and the perspective of the situation, problems, and local challenges within the unit AO.

                                     Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Preparation Activities



CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT
   4-7. The capabilities and histories of friendly force organizations, manpower, equipment, logistics,
   training, leadership, infrastructure, facilities, and readiness are continuously monitored and updated based
   on the CBRN threat and OE assessments. During the preparation or preexecution phase, precombat checks
   and inspections are conducted. (See appendix G for preparation checklists that provide force readiness
   information.)

VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS
   4-8. A vulnerability assessment evaluates the potential vulnerability of critical assets against a broad
   range of identified CBRN threats and hazards. The vulnerability assessment provides a basis for
   determining mitigation measures for the protection of critical assets. These measures may reduce risk by
   deterring, detecting, denying, or devaluing the potential threat element before or during the execution of an
   enemy attack. The vulnerability assessment is the bridge in the methodology between the CBRN threat
   and/or hazard, OE, and capability and the resultant level of risk. Based on the commander’s risk-based
   guidance, vulnerability reduction and mitigation measures are implemented during the preparation phase.
   Vulnerability reduction measures occur as part of a commander’s CBRN protection strategy, to include
   corresponding CBRN protection measures. Passive defense is the focus of the vulnerability reduction
   measures discussed in this chapter.
   4-9. The highest priorities for passive defense are force survivability and successful mission
   accomplishment. Passive defense operations include measures to minimize or negate the vulnerability to,
   and minimize the effects of, CBRN use; this includes protecting assets, sustaining mission operations, and
   minimizing casualties. Passive defense vulnerability planning is supported by higher commands that
   provide available information on enemy capabilities and technical reachback capability. (See appendix H
   for technical reachback capabilities.)
   4-10. Preattack vulnerability reduction actions are critical because they increase the unit survivability to the
   greatest possible extent. These actions include selecting the right and collective protection, fortifying
   shelters, establishing procedures for warning and reporting, and protecting vital equipment to increase
   survivability.
   4-11. Additionally, whenever the tactical situation permits, units prepare defensive positions that vary from
   individual fighting positions to improved critical infrastructures at installations and fixed sites. These
   actions and prior planning protect against CBRN effects. The primary concern should be shielding
   personnel from CBRN threats and hazards. (See appendix E for vulnerability reduction measures.)

TASK ORGANIZATION
   4-12. The way that CBRN assets go to war is not always the way they execute operations. CBRN forces
   can be cross-attached or reorganized to meet mission requirements, and they are managed in a way that
   maintains the quality and overall health of our expeditionary force. CBRN forces are unique, flexible, and
   tailored for joint mission requirements—to provide defense support to civil authorities or to surge and
   conduct major combat operations when required. (See appendix I for USA capabilities and employment,
   appendix J for USAF, appendix K for USMC, and appendix L for USN.)
   4-13. Task organizing is the act of designing an operating force, support staff, or logistics package of
   specific size and composition to meet a unique task or mission. Characteristics to examine when task-
   organizing the force include—but are not limited to—training, experience, equipment, sustainability, OE,
   enemy threat, and mobility. Today’s OE of continuous operations renders the old paradigm of tiered
   readiness obsolete. Tiered readiness created “have” and “have-not” units by allocating resources according
   to unit placement in the deployment sequence for contingency war plans. Tiered readiness also cascaded
   equipment modernization by units. Commanders and staffs must align CBRN units against future missions
   as early as possible and task-organize modular expeditionary forces that are tailored to meet joint mission
   requirements.

Chapter 4



      4-14. Task organizing CBRN forces yields a significant number of advantages, which include—
               A steady-state supply of trained and ready warfighters with enablers.
               Stabilized personnel who train, deploy, and fight together in the same unit.
               Deployment planning goals to identify high-demand, low-density units.
               The opportunity to synchronize a broad range of force-generating processes.

MOVEMENT
      4-15. If necessary, the early movement of CBRN units, personnel, and equipment to support mission
      requirements will occur during the preparation phase.
      4-16. Movement includes planning, routing, scheduling, and controlling personnel and materiel
      movements into, within, and out of an AO. Maintaining movement control, keeping lines of
      communication open, managing reception and transshipment points, and obtaining HN support are critical
      to CBRN operations.
      4-17. The analysis of terrain and weather helps commanders and staffs find tactical advantages by
      analyzing and comparing the limitations of the physical environment on friendly, enemy, and neutral
      forces. Terrain includes operating surfaces and man-made features (cities, airfields, bridges, railroads,
      ports). The type of surface will be integral to determining the persistency, off-gassing, adsorbance,
      absorbance, and reactivity of agents and materials.
      4-18. Weather and terrain also have pronounced effects on maneuver capabilities, precision munitions, air
      support, and CBRN operations. The nature of CBRN operations extends the analysis of the natural
      environment (weather and terrain) into the context of the physical environment of a contaminated AO.
      Terrain directly affects the selection of objectives and the location, movement, and control of forces.
      4-19. CBRN staffs should coordinate with commanders of fixed installations (APODs, SPODs) and
      understand the CONOPS and procedures associated with operating on a fixed installation. (See
      Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
      Nuclear Defense for more guidance.)

COORDINATION AND LIAISON
      4-20. The commander will publish the appropriate guidance required to establish CBRN defense roles and
      responsibilities for separate organizations/Services located in the same area.
      4-21. Coordination is the action necessary to ensure that adequately integrated relationships are established
      between separate organizations located in the same area. (See Operational Terms and Graphics for more
      information.) The coordination of CBRN forces may include decontamination support, reconnaissance
      AORs, deconfliction of CONOPS and standing operating procedures (SOPs) in the same location with
      differing Services and nations (APOD/SPOD), obscuration measures, and area reconnaissance.
      4-22. Coordination takes place continuously throughout operations. Commands do not operate in isolation;
      they synchronize their actions with those of others. Coordination is essential to this synchronization. The
      objectives of coordination include, but are not limited to—
                Ensuring a thorough understanding of the commander’s intent and subordinate and supporting
                 force roles.
                Ensuring that affected and interested personnel have been consulted or informed, as time allows,
                 so that they may respond as desired or adjust their plans and actions.
                Ensuring that commanders and staffs consider as many relevant factors as time permits and
                 effectively employ available assets.
                Ensuring appropriate liaison with affected and potentially supportive civilian HSS facilities and
                 conducting an assessment of the capabilities and limitations of those facilities.
                Communicating with HSS for health services (medical surveillance).
                Avoiding conflict and the duplication of effort among units and reducing fratricide and resource
                 expenditures.

                                     Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Preparation Activities



LOGISTICS
   4-23. Pre-positioning, maintaining, and issuing CBRN defense equipment and supplies occur during
   preparation. Other possible logistics activities include identifying water supply points, identifying medical
   treatment facilities, ensuring the availability of system level contracted logistics support, and identifying
   resources available in the area and making arrangements to acquire them. Commanders direct operations
   security measures to conceal preparations and friendly intentions.
   4-24. Medical treatment personnel and medical treatment facilities may have a limited stock of antidotes,
   immunizations, pretreatments, and other Class VIII supplies on hand. However, resupply must be readily
   available for continuous response to the incident. (See FM 4-02.1 and JP 4-02.)

EDUCATION
   4-25. Professional military education is comprised of progressive levels of military education that prepare
   military officers and NCOs for leadership. It includes various basic level courses for new and junior
   officers; command and staff colleges for mid-level officers; war colleges for senior officers; primary, basic,
   and advanced leadership courses for enlisted personnel and junior and senior staff level NCOs; and the
   sergeants major academy for senior NCOs.
   4-26. Professional military education can develop much of the CBRN-specific knowledge and many of the
   specialized skills that commanders require. Developing leadership qualities and practicing leadership skills
   are necessary for subordinates to make effective decisions and act decisively during operations.

TRAINING
   4-27. CBRN-specific training is necessary to ensure that forces are prepared to accomplish assigned
   missions and manage CBRN threats and hazards in the OE. A CBRN training program will significantly
   reduce the overall vulnerability of a unit to CBRN threats and hazards and provide immediate payback to
   overall readiness by increasing awareness and reinforcing critical individual and collective skills. Areas
   that require training include the capability to—
             Designate proposed decontamination sites.
             Assess the CBRN threat, potential risk, and likelihood of attack; and accomplish vulnerability
              assessments.
             Implement coordinated CBRN plans.
             Prepare to provide care for casualties.
             Determine and implement the mission-oriented protective posture (MOPP) level.
             Minimize skin exposure.
             Continue good hygiene and sanitation practices.
             Deploy and activate detectors.
             Execute environmental sampling operations.
             Designate and prepare shelters.
             Watch for attack indicators.
             Cover or conceal unprotected, mission-essential equipment.
             Conduct meteorological monitoring.
             Integrate available alarm and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear warning and
              reporting systems (CBRNWRSs).
             Ensure that pretreatments, chemoprophylaxis, immunizations, insect repellents, and barrier
              creams are available and in use, as appropriate.
             Use collective protection.
             Use emergency response (fire and rescue, hazardous materials, and explosive ordnance disposal
              [EOD]) capabilities.
             Conduct medical surveillance.
             Establish baseline medical surveillance.

               Coordinate health risk assessments for the population at risk.
               Coordinate CBRN and medical capabilities.
               Establish procedures for tracking, raising, and lowering MOPP levels.
               Place and deploy active defense units.
      4-28. Training provides the means to practice, develop, and validate—within constraints—the practical
      application of multi-Service doctrine. Equally important, it provides the only peacetime basis for the
      firsthand experience essential to commanders and staffs in exercising C2.
      4-29. Commanders aggressively train to overcome institutional obstacles to mission command (frequent
      deployments of organizations comprised of units that have not trained together, personnel turbulence
      caused by operational commitments, constrained financial resources). In particular, commanders use
      training events to create common experiences that increase trust, foster teamwork and confidence, and
      allow commands to acquire competence in mutual understanding. Well-trained teams are able to
      communicate explicitly and implicitly, conduct decentralized operations, and achieve unity of effort in
      uncertain situations by operating within the commander’s intent.

REHEARSALS
      4-30. A rehearsal is a session that occurs during preparation in which a unit or staff practices expected
      actions to improve performance during execution. They are the commander’s tools used to ensure that
      staffs and subordinates understand the commander’s intent and CONOPS. Rehearsals also synchronize
      operations at times and places critical to successful mission accomplishment. The extent of rehearsals
      depends on the time available and allows participants in an operation to become familiar with the plan.
      Rehearsals translate the plan into a visual impression that orients units, staffs, and individuals to their OE
      and to other units that will execute the operation. Finally, effective rehearsals further imprint a mental
      picture of the sequence of key actions within the operation and provide a coordination forum for
      subordinate and supporting leaders and units.
      4-31. Rehearsals focused on CBRN-related, incident-response actions and linkages to C2 contribute to
      external and internal coordination. They accomplish the following:
                Reveal unidentified external coordination requirements.
                Help synchronize the operation at key points by identifying times and locations requiring
                 coordination and solutions for coordinating actions.
                Support internal coordination by identifying tasks needed to accomplish external coordination.
                Update internal coordination techniques (synchronization matrix, decision-support template).
                Practice essential tasks (improve performance).
                Reveal weaknesses or problems in the CBRN plan.
                Coordinate the actions of subordinate CBRN support elements.
                Improve the warfighter’s understanding of the CONOPS (foster confidence in warfighters).
      4-32. At the tactical level, rehearsals include subordinate leaders briefing their planned actions sequence to
      the leader, and the leader briefing the higher headquarters command hierarchy.

EXERCISES
      4-33. The CBRN unit commander or staff can use major training events (situational training exercises,
      external evaluations, deployment exercises) to provide feedback and assist commanders in assessing the
      effectiveness of their leader, individual warfighter, unit adaptiveness, and maintenance training programs.
      Exercises enable units and individuals to—
                Establish and sustain their tactical and technical training proficiency by learning how to solve
                 tactical problems and give appropriate and meaningful orders.
                Receive feedback on the quality of their decisions and obtain an understanding of the impact that
                 the frictions of the OE have on their decisions.

                                    Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Preparation Activities



   4-34. Exercises produce adaptive leaders who are tactically and technically competent, are confident in
   their abilities, and routinely demonstrate initiative within the framework of the commander’s intent.

HEALTH SERVICE SUPPORT
   4-35. According to FM 4-02.7, HSS is integrated into the preparation process to support unit readiness.
   Key elements include casualty estimation, prophylaxis (including immunizations), active medical
   surveillance, preventive medicine, diagnostics, mass casualty management, evacuation, and patient
   decontamination requirements for HSS operations. Unit plans should recognize that CBRN attacks have the
   potential to create mass casualties and that the treatment and evacuation of CBRN casualties will be
   difficult and hazardous to the patients, medical personnel, and facilities.
   4-36. HSS may include support to evaluate CBRN exposure/contamination information and characterize
   effects and associated operational risk levels. This may also include the provisions of health risk
   assessments and exposure guidelines. The analysis of health and medical services should determine how
   well a unit can provide adequate health and medical care at the CBRN attack site and within the medical
   system.
   4-37. The use of CBRN weapons or systems may create large numbers of casualties in short periods,
   compromise the quality and quantity of health care, pose a serious contamination threat to medical
   personnel, constrain mobility and evacuation, and potentially contaminate the logistical supply base. These
   factors have the potential of severely degrading health care delivery, and they require detailed planning.
   HSS analysis should observe preattack and postattack medical planning, to include how well a unit—
             Conducts prior coordination with subordinate, adjacent, and higher headquarters; HN, state, and
              local medical facilities; and aeromedical evacuation units.
             Trains medical teams in the identification, treatment, and handling of contaminated casualties.
             Detects contamination, supervises patient decontamination, and treats patients.
             Designates areas in medical facilities to segregate and treat contaminated patients.
             Assesses and identifies suspicious illnesses and diseases.
             Provides, stockpiles, and develops a plan for the distribution of antidotes, pretreatments, and
              prophylaxes for potential agents (including agents or antidotes from commercial or industrial
              sources) based on the existing threat.
             Conducts medical evacuation and incorporates contaminated patient transport and contamination
              control into litter and ambulance operations.

Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Execution
                        Activities
       This chapter provides an overview of CBRN execution activities that support C2
       functions throughout the operations cycle. The CBRN shape function is
       predominantly composed of processes for the collection, processing, correlation,
       compilation, analysis, decisionmaking, and dissemination of CBRN data and
       information. This allows the commander to make the educated use of information to
       optimize the capability of U.S. forces and operate in a CBRN environment. The
       fusion of data, coupled with visualization and decisioning tools, provides the
       commander and CBRN staff tactical-level with capability employment planning data
       and considerations for how CBRN threats and hazards shape military operations; it
       imparts an understanding of where and when to expect CBRN hazards by applying
       CBRNWRS. During the execution phase, assessment activities occur during the
       preincident and postincident phases of operations. (See appendix M for execution
       activities.)

INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE
INTEGRATION
   5-1. ISR are preincident activities that facilitate the assessment of CBRN threats and hazards; they are
   key enablers that provide a visualization of the CBRN environment to the commander and CBRN staff.
   Visualization helps to develop a clear understanding of the current and predicted CBRN situation, envision
   the end state (mission accomplishment without CBRN casualties or operating tempo degradation), and
   anticipate the sequence of events that moves the force from its current state to the desired end state.
   5-2. During execution, staffs continuously collect, assess, and evaluate CBRN-related information
   received from ISR collection requirements and friendly reports; and they use this information to update
   IPOE/IPB products, which contribute to the commander’s situational understanding. IPOE/IPB produces an
   integrated picture of the OE, including operating surfaces and terrain, to support the production of
   predictive and dynamic (near-real-time) intelligence.
   5-3. The intelligence cell evaluates the ongoing operation against the current picture produced by
   IPOE/IPB. It forecasts what, when, where, and how changes in the AO will occur based on this evaluation.
   5-4. The current operations cell integrates the IPOE/IPB products, including forecasts of change and
   implications for future operations, with other relevant information into the operations staff estimate.
   5-5. Commanders use the IPOE/IPB and other staff estimates to refine their visualization, assess the
   situation, and direct adjustments. Significant or forecasted changes in the CBRN environment or threat may
   result in changes to the order (adjustments).




28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                             5-1
Chapter 5



      5-6. The CBRN cell in the unit staff translates source information into an understanding of the CBRN
      threat and the AO for CBRN actions. This process includes tracking the status and allocation of CBRN
      resources and conducting activities to ensure the readiness and preparedness for the sustained effective
      performance of CBRN tasks within a CBRN environment. This process requires—
                Timely action to assess vulnerability.
                Specific COAs for reducing vulnerability and countering specific threats.
                CBRN warning and reporting on potential and actual CBRN attacks to facilitate risk
                 assessments.
                Actions to minimize the short- and long-term health effects of toxic exposures.
      5-7. Decisionmaking must take advantage of information available to plan, prepare, rehearse, and execute
      operations in a CBRN environment. Commanders and CBRN staffs must determine which inputs will
      affect a given decision point and the effectiveness of these inputs. They must also analyze execution
      requirements for typical decision points with relevance to CBRN contamination avoidance, CBRN
      protection, and CBRN decontamination. The application of these principles helps to minimize
      vulnerabilities, protect friendly forces, and maintain the force operating tempo to achieve tactical objectives
      while complicating adversary targeting.
      5-8. The ability to recognize the presence or absence of CBRN threats and hazards in the AO through ISR
      TTPs is essential to CBRN contamination avoidance, FP, survival, and restoration. Actionable ISR
      inputs—
              Support the commander’s execution decisions by fusing information from various sources.
              Establish requirements for other avoidance measures (sounding alarms, marking hazards,
               warning forces).
              Guide essential implementation measures designed to avoid or limit exposure (increased shelter
               use during CBRN employment windows).
              Provide key information for movement before, during, and after CBRN attacks.
      5-9. Fundamentally, CBRN protection consists of those actions taken to prevent or mitigate hostile
      actions against personnel, resources, facilities, and critical information. These actions conserve force
      fighting potential for decisive application. Offensive and defensive measures are coordinated and
      synchronized to enable the effective employment of the force while degrading opportunities for the
      adversary. CBRN protection conserves the force by providing individual and collective-protection
      capabilities. In CBRN environments, the commander’s COA must take into account a number of unique
      considerations that have a significant effect on FP. These include—
                Interdiction.
                Collateral damage planning and assessments.
                Early and sustained operations to disrupt or destroy CBRN capabilities.
                Multilayered defenses against CBRN weapons delivery.
      5-10. After a CBRN attack, commanders and CBRN staffs must prioritize requirements to restore forces
      and operations to a near-normal capability. Decontamination operations are labor-intensive, and decisions
      will depend on—
               Agent type.
               Weather and terrain conditions.
               Extent of contamination.
               Enemy situation.
               Mission.
               Decontamination assets available.
               Level of contamination/exposure and associated degree of health and operational risk.
               Time and resources available to mitigate risk to lower levels.

         provide detailed TTP for the technical aspects of contamination avoidance, individual and
         collective protection, and decontamination.


INCIDENT MANAGEMENT
   5-11. Commanders must be provided with timely, accurate, and evaluated information on contamination
   from CBRN incidents (intentional or accidental). These incidents can have a significant effect on military
   operations, plans, and decisions. Prior planning and preparation processes (to include ISR operations and
   targeting) presume success, but there is always the chance that a CBRN incident will occur. CBRN incident
   management involves the response to a CBRN threat or hazard with known or unknown factors activated
   by trigger events (decision points). Trigger events help determine when the response to a CBRN incident
   begins and may prompt immediate or delayed response actions.
   5-12. A CBRN incident is characterized on the basis of the intent, opportunity, and capability of the
   occurrence. There are three basic reasons why a CBRN incident happens, regardless of the type and
   nature—intentional, accidental, and natural—and the distinguishing difference between the three is the
   intent. Intentional releases against U.S. forces will normally be the only incident type that commanders will
   be required to respond to or support. Response to accidental and natural CBRN incidents is normally
   accomplished by local, state, and federal response units. Commanders whose units are exposed to
   accidental or natural CBRN hazards are responsible for the safety of their personnel. Terrorist acts
   involving CBRN are considered CBRN consequence management incidents. DOD support of a CBRN
   consequence management incident is limited to a few specially trained CBRN consequence management
   units. (See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
   Nuclear Consequence Management Operations.)
   5-13. An intentional CBRN incident is normally the result of an enemy’s use of CBRN weapons, but may
   include the release of TIM from, an industrial facility. An intentional CBRN incident is the primary
   concern for commanders. Protecting assets from, and mitigating the effects of, intentional CBRN agent use
   by a hostile state or nonstate actor against U.S. forces is a function of the combating CBRN passive defense
   mission area.
   5-14. An accidental CBRN incident is an event caused by human error or natural or technological reasons
   (spills, accidental releases, leakages). These accidental incidents are usually referred to as hazardous
   materials accidents.
   5-15. A natural CBRN incident includes outbreaks of infectious diseases (severe acute respiratory
   syndrome, pandemic influenza).

         Note. Other CBRN incidents that impact the agricultural and economic structure occur through
         livestock, crops, and contaminated foods. These types of incidents may occur accidentally or
         intentionally.

   5-16. Monitoring and knowing when a trigger has occurred helps shape the ability of the force to respond.
   An effective response will drive more effective restoration operations, limit the severity of the CBRN event
   on operations, and reduce the overall number of casualties. Notification, warning, and reporting will trigger
   protective actions to prevent the exposure of resources. Most preincident activities occur during the
   planning and preparation phases, and they are predominantly functions of CBRN sense and CBRN shield.
   (For a more detailed discussion of preincident activities, see applicable Service doctrine.)
   5-17. The impact of a CBRN incident can affect more than one command; therefore, each command
   affected requires relevant information on the CBRN attack (when, where, impact). Executing effective
   incident communications, IM, and information and intelligence sharing are critical aspects of C2 during
   postincident activities.



28 February 2011        ATTP 3-11.6/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                                5-3
Chapter 5



      5-18. Establishing and maintaining a COP and ensuring accessibility and interoperability across the AO are
      principal goals of communications and incident management and key activities during postincident
      operations. The COP is a unique display of information that is accurate, timely, usable, complete, precise,
      reliable, and shared by more than one command.
      5-19. CBRN-related information contributes to the COP and automated CBRNWRS/Health Plan
      Management System interoperability, providing the framework necessary to—
              Formulate and disseminate CBRN threat and hazard indications, notifications, and warnings.
              Formulate, execute, and communicate operational decisions at an operational area and between
               operational headquarters across the AO.
              Prepare for potential requirements and requests supporting CBRN capabilities.
              Develop and maintain SA.
      5-20. CBRN shape functions, or monitoring designated elements of the COP that are tied to the
      commander’s criteria for success, require special attention from staff officers during postincident
      operations. The focus of the CBRN staff is on collecting the critical information that the commander needs
      to mitigate the effects of the incident.
      5-21. Postincident awareness is achieved by the information provided, but it takes an understanding of the
      information to make prompt, correct decisions (changing a route to avoid contamination, adjusting the
      MOPP level).
      5-22. The COP also allows leaders to understand current CBRN logistics postures and supports the ability
      to respond to known requirements. Leaders at the tactical level will use the COP to analyze and share
      assessments through a collaborative planning process enabled by information technologies. This is made
      possible through a real-time, web-based information system that provides accurate, actionable visibility as
      part of a common logistics operating environment, effectively linking the operator and the logistician
      across joint forces and from the foxhole to the national level.
      5-23. Leaders must be able to conduct rapid, tactical decisionmaking and commander action-centric
      operations, from physical rehearsals to virtual training and from static counterproliferations to battle
      command on the move. Terrain and weather form the foundation of the COP, the summation of critical
      combat information within the AO. The ability of the command to achieve information superiority; conduct
      precision strikes; and execute rapid, violent, decisive engagements will hinge on the quality, fidelity, and
      freshness of the COP. Accurate terrain and weather products, with great spatial and temporal details, are
      necessary to support network sensing, mission analysis, and the MDMP/MCPP.
      5-24. As necessary, the CBRN staff recommends adjustment decisions to the commander based on its
      ongoing assessment and running estimate, in which the CBRNWRS plays a pivotal role. Maintaining the
      COP with manual or automated data inputs ensures that U.S. forces can make informed CBRN-related
      decisions. CBRNWRS input may include the following:
                Friendly CBRN air, maritime, and ground force tracks/locations within the operational area.
                Enemy air, maritime, and ground-force CBRN capabilities within the operational area.
                CBRN operational overlays.
                Meteorological and terrain overlays.
                CBRN-related nongovernmental organization products.
                Other information or graphic displays required.

            Note. Common warfighting symbology standardization is provided by Military Standard (MIL-
            STD)-2525C. Operational Terms and Graphics sets forth doctrine for the USA and USMC in
            the use of land-based warfighting symbology.

      5-25. Technical reachback is the ability to contact SMEs when a technical issue following a CBRN
      incident exceeds command and staff capability. During postincident activities, commanders and staffs
      maintain technical links with appropriate joint, federal, and state CBRN asset, and research, development,
      and technical communities to assure CBRN response success. Reachback should be conducted using
      established unit protocols.

                                      Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Execution Activities



WARNING AND REPORTING SYSTEMS
   5-26. During execution activities, CBRN warning and reporting is an IM function that entails collecting
   and analyzing data from assessments within CBRN functional areas (CBRN shape, CBRN sense, CBRN
   shield, and CBRN sustain) to support CBRN preparations based on plans, the commander’s intent, and the
   operational context and situation. The CBRNWRS is being gradually developed to automate the process of
   providing relevant, precise, accurate, timely, usable, and complete CBRN defense-related information to
   the warfighter. The CBRNWRS must be tailored to fit the unique capabilities, needs, and operating
   procedures of specific AORs.
   5-27. The CBRNWRS is the primary means of warning units of an actual or predicted CBRN hazard and
   provides the information needed to develop the COP and support the CBRN C2 process. It provides quality
   information to the right person, at the right time, and in a usable form to facilitate understanding and
   decisionmaking, allowing commanders and CBRN staffs to determine required protective measures and
   plan operations accordingly.

         Note. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) conducts CBRNWRS activities
         according to Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 2103/Allied Tactical Publication (ATP)-
         45(C), and U.S. forces have implemented this agreement in Multiservice Tactics, Techniques,
         and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Contamination Avoidance.

   5-28. CBRNWRS capabilities include manual and automated processes in the creation, collection, and
   control; dissemination; and storage and retrieval of information obtained from affected forces, coalition
   partners, and appropriate nongovernmental organizations and indigenous agencies. Capabilities may range
   from detectors and alarms that are not integrated to fully integrated sensors at selected locations, allowing
   the commander and CBRN staffs to anticipate future conditions and accurately assess risks. The vertical
   and horizontal exchange of CBRN-related information relayed through the CBRNWRS keeps different
   commands, agencies, coalition partners, and functional/staff personnel informed. The CBRN staff
   determines the need for specific types of CBRN information (the “when” and “where” of the CBRN
   attack).
   5-29. Currently, many CBRN agent detector and alarm arrays operate as independent units; therefore,
   when a CBRN attack is detected, only those personnel in the immediate vicinity hear the alarm. Adjacent
   units need to be notified by radio, wire communications, audible means, or verbal means. In contrast, other
   CBRN agent detectors may not be physically connected and may appear to be operating independently, but
   in actuality, they are operating as a network. For example, while a shipboard detector may not directly
   communicate with another detector on a vessel 40 miles away, the two ships are connected via data links
   and other communication networks. The ships are similarly connected to higher authority via the same
   means; therefore, each single ship’s detector is not independent. CBRN calculations in support of CBRN
   hazard prediction are often done manually. (For a detailed explanation of the manual method, see existing
   doctrinal publications.)
   5-30. The information received from an integrated detection network helps provide an assessment of the
   current situation by detecting/identifying CBRN threats and hazards in air, on water, or on land. The sensor
   network detects and identifies CBRN threats and hazards that are affecting personnel, equipment, or
   facilities and identifies the physical state of such hazards (gas, liquid, or solid). An automated CBRNWRS
   is also known as a CBRN IM system.
   5-31. IM supports execution activities based on plans, preparation, the commander’s intent, and the
   operational context and situation.
   5-32. CBRN IM systems focus on implementing warning and reporting measures and providing a CBRN
   COP, which are displays of relevant CBRN information that facilitate collaborative planning and the
   assessment of the effect of a CBRN incident on operations.
   5-33. CBRN IM systems—
           Provide a CBRN information-centric database, including facilities for information retrieval,
            linking CBRN sensors to C2 information systems and databases.
           Facilitate the fusion of sensor data to provide automatic alerts and inputs to hazard prediction.

               Generate CBRN information that is dynamic by the phase of operation, level in command, role,
                and function.
               Produce CBRN hazard templates and plume predictions overlaid on a digital map.
      5-34. To assist commanders and improve and automate the information-gathering and -sharing process,
      several government and commercial off-the-shelf systems have been developed and are in use throughout
      the U.S. military.

            Note. An automated version of the CBRNWRS (JWARN) is currently being integrated into
            existing information systems to collect, process, store, protect, display, and disseminate CBRN
            information.

      5-35. As a postincident automated warning and reporting tool, JWARN provides an operational capability
      to employ CBRN warning technology for collecting, analyzing, reporting, identifying, locating, and
      disseminating CBRN, environmental, and TIM information. This information is an integral element of
      information technology systems, using near-real-time information.
      5-36. JWARN functionality can be used at individual warfighter to strategic-level authorities to provide a
      means of informing friendly units about possible contamination. JWARN provides the capability to
      conduct analyses of CBRN incidents, ensuring that SA provides minimal risks to friendly forces. After a
      CBRN incident, tactical-level CBRN units (reconnaissance, surveillance, decontamination, and
      obscuration) conduct operations and use the JWARN capability to notify personnel and distribute gathered
      information to higher headquarters. Operations conducted include route decontamination; reconnaissance
      survey; contamination crossing, obscuration, MOPP, and heat stress analyses; and flame field expedient
      plans.
      5-37. For JWARN to be an effective tool in CBRNWRS, users must understand how it works, the
      importance of the different messages, and their use at each echelon. The JWARN program is based on
      STANAG 2103/ATP-45C and specific, standardized NBC report formats. These standardized reports
      include:
               Observer’s data.
               Evaluated data.
               Immediate warning data of predicted contamination and hazard.
               Reconnaissance, monitoring, and survey results.
               Areas of actual contamination.
               Detailed information.

            Note. Each report has a specific use at different levels within the tactical and operational
            environments. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological,
            Radiological, and Nuclear Contamination Avoidance.)


HAZARD PREDICTION AND MODELING
      5-38. To provide commanders with an analysis of CBRN hazards, predictions, and effects in their AO,
      CBRN staffs and CBRN reconnaissance units may use advanced CBRN modeling scenarios, in conjunction
      with JWARN, as a CBRN shape tool during execution activities. JWARN provides the ability to compute
      the transport and dispersion of chemical and biological (CB) agents and simulate hazards in a variety of
      scenarios. (See appendix F for JWARN capabilities.)
      5-39. During the execution phase of the CBRN operations process, CBRN hazard and prediction modeling
      is capable of near-real-time COA analyses and predictive evaluations under CBRN situations and provides
      CBRN staff planners with the analytical capability to determine and assess the impact of a CBRN incident
      on military operations. (See appendix F for Service-specific CONOPS, programs of record, and emerging
      CBRN hazard and prediction modeling capabilities.)

                                      Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Execution Activities



CASUALTY AND FATALITY MANAGEMENT
   5-40. Tactical plans should recognize that CBRN attacks may produce mass casualties and mass fatalities.
   With the employment of CBRN weapons/agents, a mass casualty and/or a mass fatality situation can
   present itself at anytime and at any role of care.
   5-41. The treatment for mass casualties is often limited to life- or limb-saving care, and triage must be
   conducted within strict guidelines. Medical staffs conducting triage should know the differences in triage
   priorities that occur, depending on which CBRN agent is suspected. For example, while it is important that
   patients be decontaminated before they are admitted to an uncontaminated area, radiation-contaminated
   casualties usually pose a low risk to health care workers, so treatment may be started before
   decontamination.
   5-42. Mass fatalities from CBRN attacks require that contaminated remains be processed through the
   mortuary affairs decontamination collection point. In general, an appropriate medical authority (the theater
   mortuary affairs officer, medical examiner), possibly in coordination with the joint security coordinator,
   will determine the degree of hazard and appropriate disposition of human remains.
   5-43. The movement of patients and human remains is normally a Service responsibility using organic
   assets (personnel, surface vehicles, and aircraft). This movement is complicated when the patients or
   human remains are contaminated. Personnel who are loading/unloading or moving contaminated patients
   and remains should be in appropriate personal protective equipment. The combatant commander (CCDR),
   with advice from the command surgeon and/or theater mortuary affairs officer, is responsible for moving
   casualties and human remains within theater and deciding the extent to which evacuation assets will be
   committed to contaminated areas. Evacuation/transportation assets should be designated as “dirty” after
   hauling contaminated patients or remains. Every effort should be made to limit the number of evacuation
   assets that are contaminated. (See FM 4-02.7 and JP 4-06.)

RESTORATION OPERATIONS
   5-44. Restoration operations are those actions taken by a military force immediately after a CBRN attack;
   it is the operational employment of forces to restore their combat capability to full operational readiness.
   Restoration operations provide a critical foundation for postconflict planning to eliminate adversary
   capabilities, restore forces and infrastructures to normal capability, and establish effective monitoring and
   other controls.
   5-45. Timely restoration is essential. Restoration operations after a CBRN attack must include actions to—
           Reduce MOPP.
           Effectively treat CBRN-affected personnel.
           Decontaminate affected equipment.
           Conduct CBRN vulnerability and capability assessments.
   5-46. Restoration operations include immediate measures for initial support response and measures taken
   thereafter to reestablish combat readiness and organizational functions. The execution of CBRN activities
   for the force and its components are continuously conducted from preincident to completion of restoration
   operations to deter or prevent multiple incidents, protect critical infrastructure, and support organizational
   restoration. Immediate and long-term restoration activities are defined as follows:
              Immediate. Command infrastructure has been returned to service and is capable of operations at
               some level. Activities, policies, or mitigation strategies aimed at restoration are considered
               achievable in 90 days or less. Immediate restoration activities within the impacted area also
               provide essential elements of information (EEI) needed by the command to facilitate the
               restoration of combat capability. Immediate restoration activities include the—
                   Safekeeping of vital resources, facilities, and records.
                   Improvisation or emergency acquisition of vital resources necessary for the performance of
                    missions.
                   Capability to relocate essential personnel and functions to, and sustain performance of
                    operations at, alternate work sites until normal operations can be resumed.

Chapter 5



                Long-term. Command infrastructure has been returned to preincident condition or has the
                 capacity to operate at preincident levels. Activities, policies, or mitigation strategies aimed at
                 long-term restoration may take longer than 90 days. The capability exists to continue combat
                 operations in a CBRN environment.
      5-47. Restoration activities should also be coordinated with vulnerability reduction and mitigation
      measures as an ongoing assessment process. Failure to perform or sustain these functions would
      significantly impact the organization’s ability to provide vital services or exercise authority, direction, and
      control.

         Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear
                   Vulnerability Assessments
       This appendix provides tools for conducting a CBRN vulnerability assessment and
       determining risks associated with vulnerabilities to a CBRN attack. It also provides
       the user with suggested TTP to mitigate and reduce these vulnerabilities. CBRN
       vulnerability assessment is a cyclic preventive-protection process that consists of the
       following key activities:
               Threat assessment (during planning).
               Vulnerability analysis (during planning).
               Vulnerability reduction (during preparation).

         Note. See appendix D for threat and hazard assessments.


VULNERABILITY
   B-1. Once the credible threats are identified, a vulnerability assessment must be performed. The CBRN
   vulnerability assessment considers the potential impact of loss from a successful attack and the
   vulnerability of the facility/location to an attack. The impact of loss is the degree to which the mission of
   the unit is impaired by a successful attack from the given threat. A key component of the vulnerability
   assessment is properly defining the ratings for the impact of loss and vulnerability.
   B-2. CBRN vulnerability assessment provides insight into the ability of the unit to mitigate likely CBRN
   threat situations and prompts the unit to develop procedures, acquire equipment, and/or take other actions
   to correct vulnerabilities before the mission is adversely affected and/or people are injured or killed.
   Knowing the risks and vulnerabilities in a CBRN environment allows commanders to determine the unit
   situation and provide options to mitigate those vulnerabilities.
   B-3. The current and future CBRN threat and hazard is global in nature and ranges from low to high
   intensity. Terrorists may be encountered at any level of conflict. The proliferation of CBRN-capable
   nations in contingency regions and the ready availability of toxic CBRN materials increase the likelihood
   of U.S. forces being direct or inadvertent targets of attack. These attacks may range from limited use in
   terrorist actions to planned targeting in support of military operations.
   B-4. Because CBRN proliferation is increasing, continental United States (CONUS) and outside
   continental United States (OCONUS) forces must be capable of accurately assessing the CBRN threat and
   hazard imposed by the opposing force and be capable of addressing unit vulnerability to attack.
   B-5. When planning operations, commanders must consider the potential effects of CBRN weapons on
   personnel and equipment. In conventional operations, the concentration of forces increases the chance for
   success, but this same concentration increases the effects of CBRN attacks and the likelihood of their
   occurrence. Commanders consider the timing of force concentration to reduce the effects of a CBRN
   attack.
   B-6. To assess a unit’s vulnerability to a CBRN attack, the commander determines how well protected the
   unit is and the type and size of weapon likely to be used against it. The commander then weighs various
   COAs and determines which presents an acceptable risk to allow mission accomplishment. This whole
   process starts with an initial assessment of the CBRN threat during the IPOE/IPB and concludes with the
   CBRN staff identifying the friendly force, mission-critical vulnerabilities and recommended vulnerability
   reduction measures.



28 February 2011        ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                               B-1
Appendix B



LEVELS
      B-7. CBRN vulnerability assessment processes have two levels of application: crisis action and deliberate.
      Time is the basic factor that contributes to the selection of the level of application used.

CRISIS ACTION
      B-8. Crisis action CBRN vulnerability assessment is an “on the run” mental or verbal review of the
      situation, using the basic CBRN vulnerability assessment process. The crisis action CBRN vulnerability
      assessment process is employed to consider vulnerabilities and risks while making decisions in a time-
      compressed situation. This level of CBRN vulnerability assessment is used during the execution phase of
      training or operations and in planning and execution during crisis responses. It is particularly helpful for
      choosing the appropriate COA when an unplanned event occurs.

DELIBERATE
      B-9. Deliberate CBRN vulnerability assessment is the application of the complete vulnerability
      assessment process when time is not critical. Deliberate vulnerability assessments primarily use experience
      and brainstorming to identify threats/vulnerabilities and develop reduction measures and controls and are,
      therefore, most effective when done in a group. Examples of deliberate applications include planning
      upcoming operations, reviewing SOPs, performing maintenance, conducting training, and developing
      damage control or disaster response plans.
      B-10. Whether conducting crisis action or deliberate planning to support CBRN vulnerability assessments
      at the tactical level, operation plans or operation orders are prepared and coordinated for the support of
      assigned missions. To support operation plan and OPORD development, COAs are developed within the
      framework of the assigned objective or mission, forces available, and commander’s intent.
      B-11. To develop COAs when confronting a CBRN threat, the CBRN staff must focus on the key
      information necessary to make decisions.
      B-12. A valid COA at the tactical level should be—
               Suitable. It must accomplish the mission (even in a CBRN environment) and comply with the
                supported commander’s guidance.
               Feasible. It must accomplish the mission within established time, space, and resource
                constraints. The commander and staff also assess the potential impact of casualties,
                contamination, and degradation.
               Acceptable. It must balance the cost with the advantage gained by executing a particular COA.
                The impact of the vulnerability reduction and mitigation measures is considered in this review.
               Distinguishable. Each COA must be significantly different from the others.
               Complete. It must incorporate major operations and tasks to be accomplished, to include
                considerations (forces required, employment concept, time estimates, desired end state).
      B-13. The COA development and analysis are synchronized within the staff to help ensure the unity of
      effort and direction.

FACTORS
      B-14. The CBRN vulnerability assessment provides the commander with an estimate of the potential
      severity of a CBRN attack or release. Threat assessment and vulnerability analysis occur during the
      planning component of the operations cycle; vulnerability reduction occurs during preparation once the
      commander provides guidance on the acceptable level of risk. (See figure B-1 for an illustration of the
      vulnerability assessment process.)




B-2                       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                28 February 2011
                              Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Vulnerability Assessments




                       Figure B-1. CBRN vulnerability assessment process


PRODUCTS AND FUNCTIONS
  B-15. The CBRN vulnerability assessment is conducted by integrating the specific threat assessment with
  the analysis of specific vulnerabilities and identification of potential vulnerability reduction measures or,
  more specifically, the ability of the force or facility to protect against and/or mitigate the CBRN threat or
  hazard. The end state during the planning phase of the operations cycle is typically an estimate and
  recommendation to the commander on the priorities for vulnerability reduction. (See appendix D for threat
  assessments.)

THREAT ASSESSMENT
  B-16. The assessment process is designed to satisfy the commander’s intent and reflect the main effort
  designation. Information regarding named areas of interest (NAIs) and target areas of interest and their
  constituent critical elements (C2 facilities, mobility corridors, troop concentrations, assembly areas) will
  suggest the CBRN threat or hazard. Define the CBRN threat or hazard in terms of the following
  characteristics:
            Lethality. Lethality is the ability of a hazard to cause death without treatment. The lethality of a
             hazard can be measured by its case fatality rate and the speed of death.
            Morbidity. Morbidity is the severity and duration of health effects without treatment.
            Communicability. Communicability is the ability of the hazard to cause secondary cases
             without quarantine or barrier nursing.
            Persistence. Persistence is the degree of continuing risk of exposure to individuals related to
             environmental exposures (air, water, soil, food, vectors, animals, and bodily fluids).

VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
  B-17. The CBRN vulnerability analysis assesses the strengths and weaknesses of the CBRN protective
  posture. The adequacy of individual and collective protection, detection, and decontamination resources
  against possible accidental releases is also considered.




  28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                               B-3
Appendix B



VULNERABILITY REDUCTION
       B-18. The commander and his/her CBRN staff use CBRN vulnerability analysis as an aid in developing
       vulnerability reduction measures to counter the CBRN threat and improve the command FP. The
       commander will decide which vulnerability reduction measures to implement (preattack, during attack, or
       postattack) based on considerations of the OE.

RECOMMENDATIONS
       B-19. The end states of vulnerability assessments are the coordinated CBRN, medical, and intelligence
       staff recommendations to the commander on vulnerability reduction measures. The recommendations apply
       the commander’s intent and guidance on acceptable risk and vulnerability reduction measures.

ANALYSIS
       B-20. CBRN vulnerability analysis is a continuous and integrated process of compiling and examining
       information on the protective posture of a unit or activity. The process assesses multiple factors
       (antiterrorism [AT], FP, medical surveillance, CBRN defense capabilities [strengths and weaknesses] of a
       force or activity). The assessment provides the commander with an estimate of the potential severity of a
       CBRN attack or accidental release. (See figure B-2 for a sample CBRN vulnerability analysis matrix.)

           where immediate control is possible (protection capabilities, MOPP levels, hygiene).

           unit is inside the detection “umbrella.”
     •     Determine if the assets can be repositioned to cover the operation.
     •     Determine if immunization rates are satisfactory for the total force. Typically, contract workers from whatever source
           require more immunizations than U.S. military personnel. Provide immunizations as soon as medical and political
           situations allow. Remember that immunizations require time to work effectively.

Step 1. Begin at the left column, and add the relative values from each column:
     •    The unit does not have hardened or semihardened infrastructures.
     •    The unit is currently in MOPP0.
     •    The unit has a biodetection unit attached.
     •    Approximately 30 percent of the unit has been immunized.
     •    The unit practices average hygienic measures.
     •    The weather and time are favorable for enemy CW agent use.
Step 2. Add the values as follows:
      •     6 for protective posture.
      •     4 for detection posture.
      •     4 for immunization.
      •     4 for hygiene.
      •     6 for time and weather.
Total equals 24 (high vulnerability).

 If the protective capability and posture provide the required protection for the predicted agent, use a value of 2.

                      Figure B-2. Sample CBRN vulnerability analysis matrix (continued)
     B-21. The CBRN vulnerability analysis represents an ongoing process and is a key first step in developing
     the CBRN defense plan. The CBRN defense plan is also continually updated to reflect the heightened or
     lowered defense capabilities of a force. There is no difference in vulnerability analysis procedures among
     chemical agents, biological toxins, radiological hazards, and nuclear attacks.
     B-22. Upon completion of the initial CBRN vulnerability analysis, the staff revises or develops the CBRN
     defense plan. The CBRN defense plan should provide tiered sets of response actions. The unit, activity,
     installation, base, ship, or port can then take the appropriate measures commensurate with the estimated
     severity of the existing CBRN threat level.
     B-23. Unit vulnerabilities may change based on—
              IPOE/IPB reassessments of adversary intent.
              Implementation of vulnerability reduction measures.
              Reduction of protective capabilities.
              Change in friendly force capabilities (increased CBRN training, enhanced proficiency).
     B-24. The goal of the CBRN vulnerability analysis is to enable accomplishment of the assigned mission
     with minimal disruption and degradation. CBRN vulnerability analysis is conducted by assessing multiple
     factors, which may include assessing the mission of the unit/activity, analyzing the critical assets and
     infrastructure, and analyzing the ability of a unit/activity to respond to a CBRN threat.

UNIT/ACTIVITY MISSION ASSESSMENT
     B-25. The mission vulnerability analysis assesses the mission of the unit in relation to the CBRN threat.
     The analysis also assesses the value of vulnerability reduction measures in terms of lost or reduced mission
     effectiveness. The commander then assesses the tradeoffs and the acceptable risk to units, facilities, and
     personnel given the potential estimated degradation in mission effectiveness.

Appendix B



CRITICAL ASSETS AND INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYZATION
      B-26. This analysis identifies critical assets and infrastructures (food and water sources) located within, on,
      and adjacent to the unit, activity, installation, base, ship, or port (high-value targets, lines of
      communications). It addresses the impact of temporary or permanent loss of critical assets or infrastructures
      on the ability of the unit, activity, installation, base, ship, or port to perform the mission. The staff
      determines and prioritizes critical assets. The commander approves the prioritized list. This assessment—
               Selects and prioritizes critical assets.
               Determines whether critical functions can be duplicated under various CBRN attack or
                accidental-release scenarios.
               Determines the time required to duplicate, recover, or restore critical assets or infrastructure if
                temporarily or permanently lost.
               Determines the vulnerability of critical assets or infrastructures to CBRN attack or accidental
                release.
               Determines the priority of response to critical assets and infrastructures in the event of CBRN
                attacks or accidental releases.

UNIT/ACTIVITY ABILITY TO RESPOND TO A THREAT
      B-27. This analysis determines the ability to plan for and respond to threat CBRN attacks or accidental
      releases impacting critical assets and infrastructures. The planning and response analysis examines passive
      defense measures and determines how well they are integrated into representative functional areas. The
      CBRN training readiness and proficiency must be analyzed when conducting the vulnerability assessment
      for each functional area outlined below.

Personnel
      B-28. The vulnerability analysis compares the number of personnel and units available to the number
      required to effectively respond to a CBRN attack or accidental release. Personnel and elements assigned or
      identified to respond to a CBRN attack may be subordinate to, or augmented by, HN, local, state, federal,
      or adjacent units.

Intelligence
      B-29. The vulnerability analysis of intelligence focuses on the organization’s ability to gather, evaluate,
      and disseminate CBRN threat information. It includes passive and active intelligence collection, the
      analysis of existing intelligence, and the nomination of intelligence collection efforts through the
      determination of information requirements, including priority intelligence requirements and specific
      information requirements.

Operations, Command, and Control
      B-30. The vulnerability analysis of planning also examines how a unit, activity, installation, base, ship, or
      port prepares to respond to an attack. While the preponderance of the actions is preincident, planners
      cannot disregard the continuous and ongoing nature of planning. In the event of a CBRN attack or
      accidental release that could impact military activities, the unit or activity must plan for and coordinate with
      a large contingent of internal and external support organizations for an effective response. The subtasks can
      include operation plans with medical and mortuary affairs annexes, operation orders, memorandums of
      agreement or understanding, C2 responsibilities, conventional vulnerability assessments, emergency
      operations center (EOC) functions, information dissemination, warning and reporting, and training
      exercises. An analysis of these subtasks for completeness, relevance, and effectiveness is considered when
      conducting a vulnerability analysis. Training must also be assessed to determine if the unit is trained and
      ready.

                               Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Vulnerability Assessments



Logistics Support
   B-31. The analysis of logistics support looks at the operational support required to respond to and recover
   from a CBRN attack or accidental release. This includes supporting logistics infrastructure and the ability
   to obtain, maintain, store, move, and replenish material resources. For example, transportation support is
   required to move assets (human and materiel) in response to a CBRN attack or accidental release. This
   includes the ability to protect the transport means and the operators during the response support. A CBRN
   environment should also increase the importance of alternative modes and routes. This makes centralized
   movement control imperative.

Communications
   B-32. Analyzing communications capabilities is vital to establishing the effectiveness of CBRN defense.
   An organization CBRN defensive capability must have the communications architecture and interfaces
   (JWARN) to support CBRNWRS requirements. A crucial aspect of implementing the plan is establishing,
   maintaining, and controlling communications among the forces in the incident area, the operations center,
   C2 elements, and CBRN response elements. Communications personnel must be able to respond to
   changing needs during the incident, maintain the existing infrastructure, respond to changing needs over a
   prolonged period, and maintain control of incoming and outgoing communications and communication
   channels included in the CBRN defense response plan.

Attack or Accidental-Release Response
   B-33. The response analysis addresses the ability of the unit or activity to take avoidance, protection,
   decontamination, or contamination control and other countermeasures to respond to a CBRN incident. Unit,
   activity, installation, base, ship, or port personnel should be trained to properly respond to, and notify the
   proper authorities of, a suspected or actual CBRN attack or accidental release. The proper authorities would
   then activate the response plan. A comprehensive response plan addresses the full spectrum of incidents
   that may occur. For example, an accidental release response capability includes the ability to detect an
   oxygen-deficient explosive or flammable atmosphere. Commanders should devise plans to achieve minimal
   mission degradation, as appropriate. Observer reports, physical evidence, and samples are important in
   documenting the attack; and the analysis should assess how well the unit plans address these representative
   functions.

Security
   B-34. The security plan must be analyzed to identify the unit’s ability to safeguard personnel, limit
   exposure, and restrict access at the site of the attack. Sufficient security forces must be organized, trained,
   manned, and equipped to react to security events involving CBRN weapons and to protect the physical
   security interests of the command. Additionally, security forces should receive training that prepares them
   to respond to CBRN attacks or accidental-release incidents.

Decontamination Assets
   B-35. The analysis of decontamination assets should include how well a unit can detect contamination,
   effect rescue, render lifesaving first aid, and provide decontamination support.

Health Service Support
   B-36. The analysis of health and medical services should determine how well a unit can provide adequate
   preventive medicine measures, health care, and medical care following a CBRN attack or accidental release
   at the incident site and within the medical system.

Support Services
   B-37. Support services coordinate efforts to provide shelter, food, and emergency relief supplies following
   a CBRN attack or accidental release. The provision of emergency shelter for CBRN attack or accidental-
   release victims includes the use of preidentified shelter sites in existing structures, the creation of



   28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                               B-7
Appendix B



      temporary facilities (tent cities), the construction of temporary shelters, and the use of similar facilities
      outside an area affected by a CBRN attack or accidental release if evacuation is necessary. A combination
      of fixed sites, mobile feeding units, and bulk food distribution is available to provide food to victims and
      emergency workers, if needed.

Public Works, Civil Engineers, and Fixed-Site Engineers
      B-38. Public works should ensure that facilities and supporting infrastructures remain operational, damage
      is remedied or mitigated, and the full recovery of affected elements is accomplished in a timely manner to
      allow for the recovery of unit operations after a CBRN attack or accidental release.

Support Functions
      B-39. An analysis of how a unit, activity, installation, base, ship, or port plans for and integrates support
      assets into its overall CBRN defense response plan should be conducted. An organization that takes a
      comprehensive approach to CBRN planning can take advantage of shared capabilities, resulting in the
      reduced expenditure of limited and finite resources.

Restoration and Recovery
      B-40. The analysis of restoration and recovery procedures gauges the capability to recover from the
      temporary or permanent loss of critical assets and infrastructures due to a CBRN attack or accidental
      release. Staffs establish restoration and recovery procedures to ensure the continued ability to perform
      ongoing and future missions. An analysis of how well a unit, installation, activity, base, ship, or port
      performs restoration and recovery procedures should be completed.

Mortuary Affairs
      B-41. This function includes the integration of mortuary affairs operations, to include the handling of
      contaminated remains. This in itself may affect CBRN vulnerability reduction measures. (See JP 4-06 for
      information on the decontamination of contaminated remains.)

Explosive Ordnance Disposal
      B-42. The unit or activity response plan integrates the capability of EOD assets. The possibility of
      unexploded ordnance (UXO) and secondary devices makes the integration of EOD capabilities essential.

Installation, Activity, and Fixed-Site Emergency Responders
      B-43. The unit or activity response plan integrates the capability of emergency responders (fire and rescue,
      emergency services, emergency medical services, hazardous materials teams) to respond to an incident.
      The integration of these capabilities saves lives and minimizes property damage.
      B-44. CBRN vulnerability analysis definitions are as follows if a CBRN attack or accidental release occurs
      during a mission:
               High. High vulnerability would generally be expected to result in—
                    The potential loss of the ability to accomplish the mission.
                    The probability of critical loss of equipment or personnel.
               Medium. Medium vulnerability would generally be expected to result in—
                    Significant degradation of mission capabilities in terms of the required mission standard.
                    The inability to accomplish all parts of the mission.
                    The inability to complete the mission to standard.
               Low. Losses would generally be expected to have a negligible effect on mission
                accomplishment.




B-8                       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                 28 February 2011
                              Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Vulnerability Assessments



  B-45. CBRN vulnerability analysis specifically focuses on casualty estimates. The basic steps for casualty
  estimation are estimating the delivery capability, generating effects information, and estimating casualty
  effects downwind. The casualty estimate process relies on thorough IPOE/IPB, enemy and physical
  environmental assessments, and friendly mission analysis. In many cases, the enemy’s primary objective
  may not be casualty generation. It may be target contamination and the degradation of mission capabilities.
  When critical equipment, facilities, or terrain are contaminated, operating tempo may slow dramatically.
  This is caused not only by casualties, but also by MOPP degradation, decontamination requirements,
  psychological impacts, and mission adjustments in response to the attack or anticipated attacks.
  B-46. The basic inputs for determining casualty effects are anticipated (or actual) friendly target size,
  anticipated agent and delivery system, and weather. Additional considerations may include individual
  protection, collective protection, and specific response actions. (See FM 4-02.7 for casualty estimation.)
  B-47. Apply rating measures in relationship to the probable agent of choice. Be aware that ratings do not
  consider troop motivation/morale factors. The final rating provides an estimate and can be used as one basis
  to support the vulnerability analysis process.

CHEMICAL AGENTS
  B-48. Unit vulnerability to a chemical attack depends primarily on the protection the unit has taken and the
  type and amount of chemical agents delivered. For nonpersistent agents, the risk of casualties to units in
  MOPP4 is negligible. This is also true for persistent agents if appropriate and timely decontamination
  measures are taken. Persistency, as defined in Potential Military Chemical/Biological Agents and
  Compounds, is an expression of the duration of effectiveness of a chemical agent. This depends on physical
  and chemical properties of the agent, weather, methods of dissemination, and conditions of terrain.
  Nonpersistent agents generally include choking agents, blood agents, and G-series nerve agents. Persistent
  agents generally include blister agents, viruses, soman, and thickened nerve agents. If personnel are forced
  to stay in MOPP gear, performance is degraded and heat casualties may occur. (See Multiservice Tactics
  Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Protection for detailed
  information on degradation factors.) The commander must achieve a balance between reducing the number
  of casualties from the attack, avoiding heat casualties, and reducing individual performance degradation.

BIOLOGICAL AGENTS
  B-49. Biological agents have the potential to cover thousands of square kilometers. Infective doses can be
  provided with a very small volume of biological agent due to the organism’s microscopic size, its ability to
  replicate in victims, its potential transmissibility, and the high levels of toxicity in comparison to classic
  chemical weapons.
  B-50. A biological attack is not likely to be identified until medical surveillance systems respond to
  patients presenting with clinical symptoms or until biological point detection systems provide a
  presumptive identification result that will likely be used to support detect-to-treat recommendations.
  Analyzing vulnerabilities relative to biological attacks or hazards relies heavily on thorough intelligence to
  assist commanders with decision support information for the following considerations:
           Immunization level (availability of prophylaxes for anticipated agents).
           MOPP levels.
           Detection posture (deployed biological detection capability [dry filter units, the Joint Biological
            Point Detection System]).
           Maneuver (mobility) status (fixed sites are static).
           Hygiene practices.
           Time and weather.

NUCLEAR AND RADIOLOGICAL THREATS AND HAZARDS
  B-51. Analyzing the vulnerability to nuclear threat and radiological hazards addresses the impacts from
  blasts (shock waves), thermal radiation (high-intensity light and heat), initial radiation (within the first
  minute after detonation), residual radiation (fallout and induced radiation), and electromagnetic pulse. The



  28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                              B-9
Appendix B



   intensity of nuclear explosion effects varies with the weapon yield and type of burst. The severity of their
   impact on friendly operations is, in part, a function of activities (training readiness, defensive measures
   taken to reduce vulnerability).

VULNERABILITY REDUCTION PROCEDURES
   B-52. CBRN vulnerability reduction measures are risk-based decisions made by the commander after the
   CBRN staff conducts the CBRN vulnerability analysis. Selected CBRN vulnerability reduction measures
   could include the following:
             Adjusting protective postures.
             Changing the disposition of units (dispersed versus clustered).
             Identifying NAIs at probable launch or use locations.
             Conducting medical countermeasures (prophylaxis, immunization, medical treatment).
             Conducting the assessment of friendly force CBRN protection, detection, identification, and
              warning.
   B-53. As CBRN vulnerability reduction measures are implemented, the vulnerability of a unit or activity to
   CBRN attacks or accidental-release events should be diminished. Commanders must weigh the cost of
   vulnerability reduction measures against the impact of implementing these measures. The commander
   determines his/her level of acceptable risk and the level of effort required for CBRN vulnerability/risk
   reduction measures.
   B-54. Active measures prevent the enemy from using CBRN weapons; passive measures increase
   survivability. Individual and unit collective measures are only discussed briefly in this appendix. (See
   Multiservice Tactics Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC)
   Protection.)

ACTIVE MEASURES
   B-55. Active measures are those measures taken to find and destroy the munitions or delivery systems. The
   destruction of delivery systems and munitions is the best method of reducing the chance of being attacked.

PASSIVE MEASURES
   B-56. It is not possible to destroy all threat CBRN munitions and/or delivery systems. Therefore, units must
   avoid being targeted and take precautions to reduce the effects of an attack if one does occur. These are
   passive measures. Units must use passive measures as part of normal operations to reduce the effects of
   operating under CBRN conditions.

Plan Ahead
   B-57. Tasks may become more complicated in a CBRN environment due to the degradation caused by the
   use of protective equipment. (Multiservice Tactics Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological,
   and Chemical (NBC) Protection contains tables to help commanders estimate how long it takes to
   accomplish missions in a CBRN environment.) Commanders must take time to carefully evaluate COAs
   and allow for the additional time requirement. This is commonly referred to as war gaming. A bad decision
   could cause the unit to become contaminated or suffer casualties. Use the CBRN threat status for planning
   and stocking CBRN defense equipment. Units must prepare to continue the mission after a CBRN attack.
   Following an enemy CBRN strike, commanders must quickly assess the damage and reconstitute lost or
   weakened units.

Avoid Detection
   B-58. Avoiding detection is the best way to prevent CBRN attacks. Do this by employing good operation
   security measures. These include camouflage, light discipline and, especially, signal security. Active and
   passive measures must be used to prevent the enemy from gaining target information. Use defensive
   electronic warfare (electronic countermeasures and electronic counter-countermeasures) to reduce the



B-10                   ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                28 February 2011
                               Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Vulnerability Assessments



   chances for identification and location. Once a CBRN attack is detected or suspected, commanders should
   consult higher headquarters for guidance if unit displacement is necessary.

Provide Warning
   B-59. If the unit is unable to avoid a CBRN attack, early warning of hazards in the AO is very important.
   The CBRNWRS notifies units that adjacent units have been attacked or that a downwind hazard is present.
   Automatic alarms positioned upwind to detect the arrival of an agent cloud may warn of probable attacks.
   When no CBRNWRS warning is received, these alarms let units adjust MOPP levels to meet the threat.
   Troops must be able to identify CBRN attacks and take appropriate actions. CBRN reconnaissance teams
   using the CBRN Reconnaissance System alert units on the move before they enter contaminated areas.

Maintain Discipline
   B-60. The unit must maintain discipline and confidence in their ability to survive and operate if they are to
   overcome the shock of a CBRN attack and continue the mission. Troops must be conditioned physically
   and mentally to wear MOPP gear and function in for extended periods. Commanders must be able to rely
   on their troops to wear MOPP gear, when required, and to remain in MOPP until cleared to reduce the
   level. Again, plan ahead. Develop MOPP acclimation plans within the unit. Use these plans whenever
   possible during unit training. Use the information contained in Multiservice Tactics Techniques, and
   Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Protection to assist in developing a unit
   acclimation plan.

Seek Protection
   B-61. Foxholes with overhead cover and shelters offer good protection against the explosive and liquid
   effects of CB weapons. However, overhead cover (tents, tarpaulins, ponchos) offers at least some
   protection from liquid chemical agents. Use CBRN protective covers whenever possible.

Disperse
   B-62. Installations and troops in compact assembly areas are vulnerable to CBRN weapons. Commanders
   must determine how much dispersion is needed. Dispersion must reduce vulnerability, but not hinder
   operations or prevent the unit from concentrating when necessary. Supplies must be dispersed so that they
   will not all be destroyed at once. This especially includes food; petroleum, oils, and lubricants; and
   ammunition. The more dispersed a unit is, the longer it will take to do even routine tasks. The degree of
   acceptable dispersion depends on METT-TC/METT-T.

Remain Mobile
   B-63. Tactical mobility gives the commander the best chance for avoidance. Constant movement prevents
   the enemy from pinpointing locations and accurately employing CBRN weapons. However, the AO will be
   a difficult place in which to maneuver. Units will have to deal with obstacles, including contaminated areas,
   tree blowdown, urban rubble, fires, flooding, fallout, and craters. CBRN reconnaissance teams and the
   serving intelligence staff officer can provide useful information. The best source of information on mobility
   routes, however, is the movement control center.

Cover Supplies and Equipment
   B-64. Store supplies and equipment under cover to prevent contamination. Buildings offer excellent
   protection. CBRN protective covers, tarpaulins, pallets, packing materials, dunnage, and plastic can be
   used. Field-expedient covers, especially canvas and cardboard, provide protection from liquid agents for
   short periods. Although contamination seeps through covers, the CBRN protective cover will provide
   protection for up to 24 hours. Units must replace the covers as soon as possible after heavy contamination.
   Canvas will keep out more than 95 percent of liquid contamination if it is removed within 60 minutes after
   the attack. Although these covers may provide protection against liquid agents, a contact hazard will remain
   until the agent on the ground and the protective cover has weathered.

Appendix B



Limit Exposure
   B-65. Plans should include postattack procedures for limiting exposure to CBRN threats and hazards. The
   longer a person is exposed to CBRN contamination, the greater the chance of becoming a casualty. Only
   personnel required to accomplish a mission are sent into a contaminated area. Limit exposure with time. By
   waiting to enter a contaminated area; the contamination level and chance of exposure are usually reduced
   by time. Exposure can also be accidental. Personnel may not know that equipment is contaminated.
   Usually, this can be prevented by always marking contaminated equipment, but there are places where
   CBRN contamination hazards can accumulate (air filters). Engines have air filters, which trap CBRN
   contaminants. These contaminants accumulate. Therefore, even if the hazard area is small, it can be deadly.
   Persons working around equipment should be aware of hidden hazards. Always dispose of contaminated
   collectors (air filters) as contaminated waste.

Prevent the Spread of Contamination
   B-66. Limit the number of personnel and amount of equipment in the contaminated area. Confine CBRN
   contamination to the smallest area possible. This begins with monitoring to determine the amount and
   extent of contamination. Units moving from a contaminated area into a clean area should decontaminate at
   or near the edge of contamination. Mark contaminated areas, and report them to higher headquarters and
   adjacent units to prevent them from entering the contaminated area unknowingly. If the situation permits,
   contaminated material can be left in the area and allowed to weather. If the equipment is mission-essential,
   it must be decontaminated or moved to the rear for decontamination. Decontaminate as far forward as
   possible. If contaminated material must be moved, the unit runs the risk of transferring contamination to
   road networks or ground surfaces. The risk of contamination transfer is proportional to the amount of
   contaminant on the material, location of the contamination, type of contamination, and type of surface on
   which the contaminant is present. When moving this equipment—
             Notify the movement control center of contaminated vehicles or contaminated routes.
             Use as few transport vehicles as possible.
             Use one route (especially around congested areas).
             Monitor the route periodically for contamination.
             Cover the material to keep contaminants from being blown onto the road. (Weigh the risk of
              ground contamination against the additional burden of decontaminating/disposing of potentially
              contaminated covering material.)
             Warn personnel downwind if a vapor hazard is present.
             Monitor and decontaminate transport vehicles before transporting noncontaminated material.
             Ensure that transport crews wear appropriate MOPP gear.
   B-67. Burn or bury contaminated or waste material when it must be destroyed. Agents destroyed by
   burning produce a vapor hazard—if material is burned, send a warning to downwind units. Burial is
   effective for contamination. Mark and avoid the area where contaminated waste is buried. The procedures
   for marking contaminated-waste burial sites are outlined in Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and
   Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Decontamination. This consists
   of submitting an NBC-5 Chemical Report outlining the contaminated-waste burial site. However, this
   report must be sent by the chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear center (CBRNC) so that a line
   item alpha (strike serial number) may be assigned. The unit that closes the decontamination site must notify
   the CBRNC.

                                                Appendix C
                                     Planning Processes
       This appendix provides tools to assist in moving the decisionmaking process from
       concept to execution. Decisionmaking is the cognitive process leading to the
       selection of a COA among variations—then knowing when and what to decide. It
       includes understanding the consequences of decisions. Decisions are the means by
       which a commander translates his/her visions of the end state into action. Planning
       considerations will revolve around the CBRN passive defense activities common to
       military missions. The planning process does not, for example, single out weapons,
       WMD elimination operations, sensitive-site exploitation, or even CBRN
       consequences, since other multi-Service tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTPs)
       address the unique planning considerations for these missions. Many aspects of
       military operations (movement rates, fuel consumption, weapons effects) are
       quantifiable. They are part of the science of war. Other aspects (impact of leadership,
       complexity of operations, uncertainty of enemy intentions) belong to the art of war. It
       is essential that leaders, from the newest Service member to senior officers,
       familiarize themselves with the art of clear, logical thinking. It is more valuable to be
       able to analyze one battle situation correctly, recognize its decisive elements, and
       devise a simple, workable solution for it than to memorize the doctrine written about
       war.

REQUIREMENTS
   C-1. CBRN operations require detailed planning to be successful. The planner must consider the hazards
   that may result from CBRN contamination. Assessments include mission analysis, COA development, and
   the analysis and comparison of enemy and friendly COAs. CBRN planning is dynamic and continuous
   from preattack to postattack. The unit CBRN personnel and staff work together to ensure that CBRN
   planning is fully integrated into deliberate and crisis action planning.

TACTICAL PLANNING
   C-2. At the tactical level, CBRN planning takes into account strategic- and operational-level planning.
   Tactical-level CBRN defense planning focuses on ensuring that commanders can accomplish their mission-
   essential tasks in CBRN environments.
   C-3. The size and location of the AO are influenced by the physical location of adversary land, air, naval,
   and space that could pose a direct threat to the security of the friendly force or the success of its mission.
   C-4. The extent to which the effects of the OE are analyzed at the tactical level largely depends on the
   mission and planning time available. At a minimum, tactical-level forces should analyze the OE in terms of
   military objectives; avenues of approach; and the effects of a CBRN environment on personnel, military
   operations, weapons systems, and force mobility.
   C-5. The tactical-level assessment of a military adversary should concentrate on factors (capability,
   disposition, tactics, and training status of tactical units or factional groups that could interfere with mission
   accomplishment). Also, units should include an assessment of potential TIM hazards from local activities
   (industrial pipelines, storage and shipping facilities).

Appendix C



CONSIDERATIONS
      C-6. CBRN defense planning and analysis assists the commander and staff in visualizing and assessing
      the full spectrum of adversary offensive CBRN weapons capabilities across the AO. Commanders, with
      staff input, assess their units’ vulnerability to CBRN attacks. Commanders determine the unit protection
      required to counteract enemy capability. They estimate the likely impact of CBRN attacks, and based on
      the CONOPS, determine methods of reducing the impact to allow mission accomplishment. This includes
      planning decontamination operations to mitigate the effects of a CBRN attack. The following should be
      considered when planning CBRN defense:
                Intelligence collection, analysis, and production. Assessments should identify threat agents
                 and weapons and industrial sites containing TIM that would present a hazard to deployed forces
                 if sabotaged or destroyed.
                SA. CBRNWRS should be activated as quickly as possible after entry into a theater. Systems
                 (Biological Integrated Detection System) should be deployed to monitor high-value assets.
                 Detection systems for CBRN agents should be deployed and networked to provide a warning of
                 attack.
                Common planning, training, and equipment standards. Gaps in the CBRN defense
                 capabilities of multinational forces are identified to promote effectiveness in planning and
                 operations.
                Medical CBRN defense. Medical CBRN defense is integrated into the planning process to
                 support unit readiness.
                Protection of the joint security area and theater sustainment capabilities. A successful
                 adversary CBRN attack on an essential port of debarkation or other critical logistics facility can
                 degrade joint force operating tempo and force generation capabilities.
                Logistics burden of CBRN attacks. The resupply of protective clothing, equipment, repair
                 parts, medical supplies (antidotes and antibiotics), and other resources must be factored into the
                 computation of resource requirements.
                In-theater active defense systems. Planners should consider deployment configurations and
                 CONOPS that maximize the use of active defense systems.
                Preplanning for attack operations. Attack operations are prioritized and may be a high
                 strategic or national priority at any point in a crisis, during the transition to war, or during
                 hostilities as a means to deny an adversary the capability to produce, store, transport, or employ
                 CBRN weapons.
                Effects of CBRN attacks on information and communication systems. Limitations will result
                 from the requirement to operate in CBRN protective equipment, from the effects of
                 electromagnetic pulse on electrical and electronic equipment to the contamination of equipment.
                Capabilities and limitations of multinational forces. The planning process should consider the
                 implications and feasibility of diverting U.S. assets and capabilities to support HNs and other
                 multinational members in meeting common operational objectives.
                In-theater consequence. Plans for in-theater consequence include the mitigation and
                 management of the effects of CBRN attacks within a theater of operations. (See Multiservice
                 Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear
                 Consequence Management Operation.)

OPERATIONAL IMPLICATIONS
      C-7. At the operational level, the analysis of the OE should concentrate on—
               The capability of transportation networks to support movement.
               Logistics support to CBRN weapons.
               Zones of entry into and through the operational area and AOI.
               The impact of large geographic features (mountains, forests, deserts, archipelagos) on military
                operations.
               Seasonal climatic impacts on CBRN weapon effects.

                                                                                           Planning Processes



TACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
  C-8. At the tactical level, the size and location of the AO are influenced by the physical location of
  adversary land, air, naval, and space that could pose a direct threat to the security of the friendly force or
  the success of its mission. The extent to which the effects of the OE are analyzed at the tactical level largely
  depends on the mission and planning time available. At a minimum, tactical-level forces should analyze the
  OE in terms of military objectives; avenues of approach; and the effects of a CBRN environment on
  personnel, military operations, weapons systems, and force mobility. CBRN defense at the tactical level
  will be based on, and result in, a higher degree of detail than would be necessary at higher levels of military
  operations.

HOMELAND DEFENSE IMPLICATIONS
  C-9. A challenge for commanders conducting consequence operations is the requirement to adequately
  protect personnel and materiel from a CBRN incident. There is a need for a response capability to save
  lives, contain an incident, and recover to a point that permits operations to resume. Confronting this
  challenge requires a comprehensive and integrated approach—from threat mitigation to incident response
  and recovery. Military units develop deliberate plans to respond to CBRN attacks within their assigned
  regions. Response plans should be updated regularly and coordinated with the appropriate response
  agencies in the region. Plans should focus on unanticipated events and potential terrorist targets (special
  events, high-profile buildings, medical and scientific research centers, air and rail transportation platforms).
  Response elements should also prioritize planning efforts in coordination with the other response agencies
  within their region. Planning efforts should be prioritized based on the most likely threats.

CHEMICAL DEFENSE PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS
  C-10. When conducting chemical defense planning, operational, tactical, and homeland defense
  implications must be considered.

OPERATIONAL IMPLICATIONS
  C-11. Chemical warfare can be used to contaminate the ground and resources with persistent chemical
  hazards. Nonpersistent vapor hazards and the vapor from persistent contamination can spread downwind
  and pose a hazard over a significant portion of the AO, given the right meteorological conditions.
  Commanders need to consider the avoidance and evacuation of hazard areas. Chemical warfare protection
  will be needed for forces that remain in the area. Operational capability and tempo are likely to be degraded
  because of the need for the force to adopt CBRN defense detection, warning, protection, and control
  measures. Chemical detection, identification, protection, and decontamination will put a burden on the
  theater logistics system.

TACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
  C-12. Forces remaining in or near chemical warfare hazard areas will probably need to remain in CBRN
  protection until the commander determines that personnel should reduce their MOPP level. This may
  decrease operating tempo because it may—
            Cause personnel to work in individual protective equipment, degrading performance, increasing
             fatigue, and possibly lowering force cohesion and morale.
            Reduce the overall speed, cohesion, and freedom of movement of forces in the local area
             because of contaminated areas and assets.
            Restrict the local use of ground and operational assets, cause resource-intensive decontamination
             of key assets, and distort the logistics chain.




  28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                                C-3
Appendix C



HOMELAND DEFENSE IMPLICATIONS
      C-13. The use of chemical agents can cause psychological and physiological effects and contamination or
      damage that will restrict the use of facilities, equipment, or supplies. Fear and panic are normal reactions to
      discussions of chemical agents, and most civilian authorities will need considerable assistance in locating,
      containing, and recovering from a chemical incident.

BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS
      C-14. The potential impact of biological warfare attacks at the operational level can be wide-ranging and
      significant, particularly if the detection and identification of an attack proves difficult and countermeasures
      are hard to implement. Large numbers of casualties can reduce the operational capability of the joint force,
      reduce morale, and divert medical and logistics resources from current operations. When combined, these
      factors may reduce operating tempo.
      C-15. There will be some loss of operational capability by those forces remaining in or near biological
      warfare hazard areas. The following factors may hinder personnel effectiveness:
               Remaining in CBRN protection for long periods of time.
               Maintaining frequent and regular health monitoring of personnel, increased standards of
                hygiene, and protection of rations and water.
               Avoiding the use of contaminated areas and assets.
               Decontaminating key assets.
      C-16. The inherent danger of biological warfare is amplified by the fact that exposure to the agents would
      probably not be known until symptoms appear (sentinel casualty). Personal protection generally consists of
      individual protection and medical measures (immunization, the application of postincident medical
      treatment [antibiotics]). Biological-agent dissemination could be accomplished by aerosol dissemination,
      food or water contamination, or vector release. Biological-agents can be produced in the laboratory or
      purchased from a number of medical research firms. For planning purposes, individual protection at a
      suspected biological incident is of the utmost importance. Mobile laboratories can process samples and
      identify pathogens. Early identification is essential to begin treatment protocols.

NUCLEAR DEFENSE PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS
      C-17. The devastation resulting from a nuclear burst will likely require that a significant portion of the joint
      force assets be deployed to assist in recovery in the area. The fallout from the nuclear detonation will cover
      a portion of the joint operations area, and measures to control the contamination and exposure of personnel
      in the area will be needed. The operational capability of the joint force is likely to be degraded for a
      considerable period. The potential for mass casualties in the local civilian population is also likely to place
      a burden on the operational command and staff.
      C-18. In the area of a nuclear detonation, the operational capability of the joint force will be seriously
      degraded. Degradation will be caused by the loss of personnel, equipment, and resources. The need to
      rescue and treat injured personnel and possibly fight fires will require a significant expenditure of
      resources. The blockage of transportation routes and mobility corridors by debris and trees may degrade
      recovery. There will also be a need to deploy assets to assist other agencies and/or the HN. The immediate
      area of the nuclear detonation is likely to be highly contaminated, and movement, except to save lives, will
      be severely limited. Fallout and induced radiation patterns will require that units follow the prescribed
      operational exposure guide.
      C-19. While the detonation of a nuclear device is perhaps the least likely scenario for a terrorist incident, it
      has the potential to cause the greatest damage in terms of destruction and psychological impact (fear and
      panic). The effects of a nuclear detonation include thermal, blast, and nuclear radiation. Even for a small
      nuclear device, the number of casualties from blast, thermal, and initial nuclear radiation could number in
      the hundreds. The presence of an induced radiation pattern and downwind fallout will require a large
      number of monitors using radiac equipment and might require the evacuation of a large number of people
      until the radiation decays to a safe level.

                                                                                           Planning Processes



RADIOLOGICAL WEAPONS DEFENSE PLANNING
CONSIDERATIONS
  C-20. Radiological warfare can be used to contaminate ground and resources with radioactive hazards.
  Commanders will need to consider the avoidance and evacuation of the hazard areas, particularly in
  stability operations and civil support operations. Radiological protection will be needed for forces that
  remain in the area. Operational capability and tempo are likely to be degraded because of the need for the
  joint force to adopt CBRN defense detection, warning, protection, and control measures.
  C-21. There will be some loss of operational capability by those forces remaining in or near radiological
  hazard areas. This will be caused by the need to—
           Remain in CBRN protection for long periods of time.
           Manage exposure to radioactive hazards and rotate personnel, particularly during support
            operations.
           Avoid the use of contaminated routes, areas, and assets.
           Decontaminate key assets.
  C-22. There are two potential scenarios for the use of radiological weapons:
           Improvised explosive device. A terrorist could wrap an improvised explosive device with
            radiological materials to create an incident in which the initial explosion may kill or injure
            persons in the immediate vicinity of the device. Following the incident, the possible ingestion
            and inhalation of radioactive particles would pose a health risk to responders and others
            remaining in the area.
           Simple dispersal. Simple radiological dispersal is an act intended to spread radioactive material
            without using an explosive device. A terrorist need only secure a supply of radiological material
            (gamma, beta, alpha emitters) from a medical laboratory, industrial facility, or other site and
            disperse the material.

ACCIDENTAL-RELEASE AND TOXIC INDUSTRIAL MATERIAL
DEFENSE PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS
  C-23. The locations of significant TIM facilities in the joint operations area need to be plotted and avoided
  during operations whenever and wherever possible. Contingency plans need to be coordinated with the HN
  to control and contain the hazards if TIM facilities are damaged. Whatever the circumstances of a TIM
  release, the impact on military capability will need to be assessed. A large-scale release from a TIM
  facility, particularly if accompanied by large fires, has the potential to spread toxic aerosols and obscuration
  across a significant percentage of the operational area. Such hazards will need to be avoided by the joint
  force or protection will be needed, particularly during support operations. This is likely to restrict the
  freedom of action of the joint force and may degrade operating tempo. Damage to nuclear facilities, even
  without a breach to core containment, may also spread radioactive aerosols and obscuration. In addition, if
  threat CBRN weapon production or storage sites are targeted and hit, downwind hazard prediction should
  be accomplished to determine if there is a threat to U.S. forces or HN personnel.
  C-24. Forces that remain in the area will probably need to adopt protection. Because of the nature of the
  TIM, countermeasures may not exist within the CBRN defense capability of the joint force. In this case, a
  specialist in the field of hazardous materials management will be needed from the HN or outside the
  theater. If conflict takes place in the area of TIM storage facilities, the risk of collateral damage and the
  release of TIM must be assessed. Unused industrial sites with hardstands and warehouses often provide
  ideal logistics facilities, but need to be checked for forms of TIM before use. Particular note of TIM needs
  to be taken when selecting accommodations for personnel.
  C-25. TIMs are substances that may create signs and symptoms similar to CBRN exposure. These materials
  are found throughout the normal transaction of daily business in the United States and are transported on
  our railways, roadways, and waterways. They may or may not be precursors to CBRN agents. Most of the
  materials contain volatile organic compounds, which are materials that contain hydrocarbons and possibly
  other hazardous elements. They may be naturally occurring or man-made and may evaporate easily based
  on agent characteristics. Testing has proven that extended exposure may lead to debilitating injury. Some


  28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                                C-5
Appendix C



      are carcinogenic (benzene) or mutagenic (hexane, causing a nervous system disorder). Technological
      innovations and the widening proliferation of CBRN hardware and scientific expertise increase the
      likelihood that states, nonstate actors, or transnational groups could threaten the U.S. homeland and
      population directly and, in times of conflict, deny U.S. access to critical overseas and domestic
      infrastructures. Terrorism remains one of the deadliest and most persistent threats to U.S. security. The
      motives and methods of terrorist groups are evolving in ways that complicate analysis, collection, and
      counteraction and require the ability to respond flexibly and quickly. Sophisticated detection and analytical
      equipment is required to detect and identify the TIM, and special protective equipment may be needed.

MEDICAL PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS
      C-26. The medical planner is responsible for developing and identifying medical countermeasures,
      coordinating HSS, and conducting integrated assessments of the risks posed by CBRN threats and hazards.
      C-27. The operational and tactical planner should understand the capabilities and limitations of the medical
      assets when planning HSS throughout the theater of operations. Unless otherwise indicated, medical assets
      without collective protection will be unable to treat casualties in chemically contaminated environments
      and may suffer operational degradation in radiological or biological environments.
      C-28. The HSS assessment is comprised of the following tasks:
               Determine the health threat/risk in the incident area, identify medical countermeasures, and
                recommend exposure guidelines/criteria for protection, unmasking, and decontamination
                decisions.
               Document exposures in individual medical records and in medical event reports, and submit the
                reports to the designated DOD exposure archive at the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion
                and Preventive Medicine.
               Identify the population at risk in the incident area.
               Identify local health care facility capabilities.
               Determine DOD augmentation needs for mass casualties.
               Determine the types and numbers of medical units/personnel required to provide support at the
                incident location.
      C-29. The CBRN staff should coordinate with the medical planner to prioritize the following key tasks:
               Determine the types and numbers of medical units/personnel required to provide support at the
                incident location.
               Establish detector and sensor systems as identified in base plans (accomplished by medical units,
                including medical treatment facilities). The systems should be established outside the medical
                treatment facilities to identify potential contamination before it enters the treatment facilities.
               Establish radiation detection capability to ensure that the deployed medical facility is equipped
                to detect radiation if the unit is deployed in a location where a nuclear/radiological threat is
                expected.
               Establish chemical detection and reporting capability for the medical units within medical areas
                or sectors.
               Establish CBRN sampling capability.
               Establish a confirmatory biological agent identification capability, to include chain-of-custody
                requirements.
               Initiate medical surveillance to support early biological-agent detection and disease and
                nonbattle injury reporting.
               Establish communication links with medical intelligence and CBRN reporting systems.
               Establish medical collective-protection capability where available.
               Establish patient decontamination capability.
               Determine the population at risk and CBRN casualty estimates.
               Tailor personnel and equipment to meet command-required capabilities.




C-6                       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                 28 February 2011
                                                                                            Planning Processes



            Ensure that appropriate deploying-unit CBRN training has occurred. Medical personnel must
             also complete additional medical-specific CBRN training.
            Ensure that medical personnel can don/doff individual protective equipment and conduct
             mission-essential tasks at appropriate MOPP levels.
            Identify CBRN-related shortfalls.
  C-30. In planning for a CBRN incident, the planner must possess a variety of references and experience
  with the medical aspects of CBRN threats and hazards. In the planning stage, the CBRN staff officer,
  public health officer, and command surgeon work together with the public affairs officer to develop tools
  (press releases to communicate risks).

KEY SUSTAINMENT PLANNING FACTORS
  C-31. Adequate logistics planning is a key element in operations and requires planning for a continuous
  resupply of consumable and expendable items. Planning for the use of collective-protection systems is one
  example of a key sustainment requirement. Survival under CBRN conditions is not a question of merely
  maintaining special-purpose supplies; it is a matter of obtaining needed quantities of existing supplies. Plan
  for the needed supplies, and stockpile them before an attack.
  C-32. As a minimum, these supplies should include protective clothing, expedient contamination avoidance
  items, decontamination kits, detector kits, and filters. Provide adequate food and water if the warfighter will
  operate for long periods within the contaminated area. If the equipment requires fuel, ensure that it is
  requisitioned and stored.

PLANS AND ORDERS
  C-33. Commanders direct operations and synchronize the warfighting functions through plans and orders.
  Commanders use factors (METT-T, METT-TC) to assess the CBRN situation. Collaborative information
  sharing and staff estimates help commanders refine and deepen their situational understanding of the OE.
  Commanders then visualize the operation, describe it within their intent, and direct their subordinates
  toward mission accomplishment.

MISSION RECEIPT
  C-34. The planning process begins with receiving or anticipating a new mission. This mission can come
  from an order issued by higher headquarters or be derived from an ongoing operation. For example, the
  commander may determine—based on a change in enemy dispositions, friendly force dispositions, or other
  battlefield factors—that there is an opportunity to accomplish the higher commander’s intent by a means
  different from the original CONOPS. (See figure C-1 for more information on mission receipt.)

MISSION ANALYSIS
  C-35. Mission analysis is the most important step of the planning process. Mission analysis allows the
  commander and staff to visualize the battlefield—to see the troops, the enemy, and the terrain/environment.
  The goal of mission analysis is to develop SA that is relative to the mission. Along with conducting a staff


  28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                               C-7

      estimate, the CBRN staff begins developing the CBRN vulnerability analysis, MOPP analysis, CBRN
      threat status, CBRN vulnerability reduction and protection measures, employment status, and task
      organization of CBRN units and assets.
      C-36. To help the commander analyze and restate the mission quickly, the CBRN staff begins analysis as
      soon as the order is received. The CBRN staff identifies constraints, restrictions, and specified and implied
      tasks contained in their portion of the order.
      C-37. The commander or CBRN staff identifies the essential tasks, which define mission success, and
      includes them in the restated mission. The restated mission contains the elements of what, when, where,
      and why the unit will execute.
      C-38. Mission analysis consists of multiple tasks, which are not necessarily sequential. This gives the
      CBRN staff a frame of reference to assess the commander’s work and develop their own visualization. (See
      figure C-2 for more information on mission analysis.)

COURSE-OF-ACTION DEVELOPMENT AND ANALYSIS
      C-39. COA development is the foundation of the CBRN defense plan. Effective COA development ensures
      that planning time is well spent and facets of relevant information are considered. COA analysis allows the
      staff to synchronize the warfighting function for each COA and identify the COA that best accomplishes
      the mission.

MISSION ANALYSIS
   C-40. Mission analysis comprises the following steps:
            Analyze the order from higher headquarters.
            Perform initial IPOE/IPB.
            Determine specified, implied, and essential tasks.
            Review available assets.
            Determine constraints.
            Identify critical facts and assumptions.
            Conduct risk assessment.
            Determine initial CCIRs.
            Determine the initial ISR plan.
            Update the operational timeline.
            Write the restated mission.
            Deliver a mission analysis briefing.
            Approve the restated mission.
            Develop the initial commander’s intent.
            Issue the commander’s guidance.
            Issue a warning order.
            Review facts and assumptions.

ANALYZE THE ORDER FROM HIGHER HEADQUARTERS
   C-41. The order from higher headquarters is thoroughly analyzed by the CBRN staff to completely
   understand the commander’s intent, mission, and CONOPS (including the deception plan). The CBRN staff
   coordinates with higher headquarters regarding—
            Procedures for requesting CBRN assets.
            Estimated response time for CBRN support.
            C2 of assigned CBRN assets.
            Linkup points and procedures for CBRN assets.
            Locations of external decontamination assets throughout each phase of the battle.
            Requests for and use of HN support.

PERFORM INITIAL INTELLIGENCE PREPARATION OF THE OPERATIONAL
ENVIRONMENT/INTELLIGENCE PREPARATION OF THE BATTLEFIELD
   C-42. IPOE/IPB is an integrated process completed by each member of the battle staff and normally
   coordinated with the intelligence staff officer. The CBRN staff officer contributes to each of the four steps
   of the IPOE/IPB process. The process is continuous, and many of the following steps and associated
   subelements may be performed simultaneously.

Step 1. Define the Operational Environment
   C-43. The AO and AOI must first be identified. The AO for the supporting force is normally the same as
   that of the supported force. The CBRN AOI encompasses threat forces and systems that are capable of
   delivering CBRN into the AO. It also includes industrial and research facilities (TIMs). Next, an in-depth
   evaluation of the area is conducted to describe the OE. The CBRN staff officer addresses the following
   areas by answering key questions:
             Threat forces and capabilities. What types and ranges of CBRN agents does the threat force
              possess? Where are the threat CBRN defense forces and CBRN weapons and delivery systems?
              When can those systems affect the unit on the battlefield?
             Population demographics. Where are the densely populated areas?



   28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                             C-9
Appendix C



             Political/socioeconomic factors. Do the threat forces have allies that might enhance their
              capabilities or trading partners that might sell weapons to them? Do the threat forces have a
              history of CBRN use?
             Infrastructure. Does the infrastructure network operate efficiently, or is it cumbersome? Are
              there industrial chemical plants or nuclear power facilities that may be targeted by threat forces?
              What is the civil response capability of hospitals, clinics, and medical treatment facilities to
              handle patients from a CBRN incident? Are facilities and water sources available to support
              decontamination operations?
             Rules of engagement and legal restrictions. Is the threat force a treaty or agreement signatory?
              Are there significant moral or religious sanctions for or against the use of CBRN weapons by the
              threat force?

Step 2. Describe the Effects of the Operational Environment
   C-44. The following tasks should be completed when describing the effects of the OE on military
   operations:
             Determine the effects of CBRN agents. The CBRN staff should determine how CBRN agents
              and obscurants affect threat and friendly operations.
             Conduct terrain analysis. The terrain should be analyzed to determine its military significance
              and predict its effect on CBRN operations. For example, terrain containing large forests tends to
              magnify the obstacle-producing effects of nuclear and chemical weapons, whereas defiles serve
              as likely employment areas for chemical weapons. Soil type, vegetation, and drainage should be
              described, and critical terrain features (defiles, choke points, rivers) should be identified. Water
              sources suitable for decontamination should be located. Mobility corridors and avenues of
              approach should be analyzed for areas that are vulnerable to CBRN weapons and areas that are
              especially suitable for the use of obscurants. The CBRN staff officer should answer the
              following questions:
                  What effect will the terrain have on CBRN weapons?
                  Where will the use of CBRN weapons cause the most problems for the operation?
                  What effects will CBRN agents have in open terrain? In heavily vegetated areas? In urban
                   terrain?
                  Can/will enemy forces use CBRN weapons to cause populations to panic? To impede
                   movement of attacking forces? To impose increased protective requirements on forces and
                   civilian populations?
                  Will reduced sanitary conditions enhance the available growth medium for biological
                   organisms, resulting in an increased probability that naturally occurring biological agents
                   and vectors will pose elevated health risks to warfighters and civilians?
                  How many civilian laboratories and major industrial facilities are located in populated
                   areas?
                  Where are critical terrain features (defiles, choke points, rivers, high ground) located?
                  To what degree does the terrain provide protection through cover and concealment?
                  Where are water sources and areas suitable for decontamination of equipment located?
             Conduct weather analysis. Detailed weather information must be obtained to determine its
              effects on the employment of CBRN weapons and materials. For example, thermometer readings
              are used to estimate the effect of temperature on agent duration; data regarding wind speed and
              direction is used for hazard and obscuration prediction; and information about atmospheric
              conditions (humidity, air stability) is useful to predict their influence on the use of obscurants.
              The CBRN staff should answer the following questions on weather analysis:
                  What effect will weather have on the employment of CBRN weapons?
                  How will weather affect the behavior of TIMs?
                  When will the weather be favorable or unfavorable for the use of CBRN weapons during the
                   next 72 hours?




C-10                    ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                  28 February 2011
                                                                                            Planning Processes



Step 3. Evaluate the Threat
   C-45. Threat force capabilities must be identified and doctrinal principles and TTP employed by the threat
   force. These factors, along with the specifics of the current situation, determine the CBRN threat condition.
   It is important that enemy unit type, composition, disposition, capabilities, and intent are well understood.
   An evaluation of the threat requires that the CBRN staff answer the following questions:
             What types of CBRN weapons, obscurants, and delivery means do the threat forces possess?
             What are the minimum and maximum ranges of the various threat force delivery systems?
             Where are the TIMs located, and how might the threat forces employ them?
             Where are the units that possess the delivery systems located, and where are their command
              posts and communications nodes?
             What types of CBRN protection and detection equipment does the threat force have?
             What type of CBRN protective posture does the threat force have?
             Is threat force CBRN weapon employment terrain-oriented, force-oriented, or a combination of
              both?
             What details are available regarding the previous use of CBRN weapons by the threat force—
              especially during recent operations?
             Are there probable employment indicators?
             Is the threat force willing and able to fight “dirty”? What is the intent of the threat force?

Step 4. Determine Threat Courses of Action
   C-46. The CBRN staff identifies likely objectives and predicts the desired end state of the threat force.
   During this phase, the information previously collected by the CBRN and intelligence staff officers is
   combined to identify possible enemy COAs. The full set of COAs for CBRN/obscurant employment
   available to the threat force is considered, and situation templates depicting probable target areas are
   created for each potential COA.
   C-47. Tasks involved in the creation of a situation template can include identifying—
            Locations on the situation template where a terrain-oriented threat force may employ persistent
             chemical agents.
            Lines or decision points where a force-oriented threat force may employ chemical agents.
            Identify high-payoff targets based on information obtained from threat-force nuclear or
             biological employment doctrine.
            Heavily populated areas that could be targeted by the threat force.
            Major agricultural, bioresearch, or pesticide facilities that could be targeted by the threat force.
            Nuclear power plants and other facilities containing radiological sources that could be targeted
             by the threat force.
   C-48. The CBRN and intelligence staff officers delineate areas on the situation templates where they
   suspect the threat force may employ CBRN weapons, and they indicate when that employment might
   occur.
   C-49. Each potential COA is evaluated and prioritized based on information concerning likely areas of
   ground force penetration by forward lines, friendly assets that the threat force is likely to consider highs for
   engagement by CBRN weapons, and existing contaminated areas that may indicate which COA was
   adopted by the threat force.
   C-50. Following situation template development, additional information requirements should be identified.
   The CBRN staff determines specific areas and activities that, when observed, might reveal which COA the
   threat has selected. These become NAIs. Templated CBRN events become NAIs and are placed on the
   situation template for each COA. The situation templates for each enemy COA are then collated; and the
   differences between NAIs, indicators, and time phase lines form the basis of the event template.
   Information requirements that require gaining information about the enemy are designated as NAIs.
   Consider using obscurants to protect infrared systems.

Appendix C



   C-51. Once completed, the CBRN IPOE/IPB provides the foundation for—
           Vulnerability analysis.
           Automatic masking criteria.
           CBRN threat status.
           MOPP analysis.
           CBRN protective measures.
           CBRN asset employment.
           Task organization.

DETERMINE SPECIFIED, IMPLIED, AND ESSENTIAL TASKS
   C-52. Specified CBRN tasks are those tasks assigned by higher headquarters. Examples of specified tasks
   include providing obscuration in support of a deception plan or providing a list of decontamination sites to
   higher headquarters for approval. Specified tasks can be found in the base plan, annexes, and overlays.
   Additionally, the commander may direct a specified task while issuing guidance.
   C-53. Implied CBRN tasks are those tasks that—although not stated in the order—must be accomplished to
   carry out a specified task. Implied tasks can be determined by analyzing doctrinal considerations that are
   necessary to perform a specified task. Implied tasks can also be derived by analyzing the current location of
   the unit in relation to the area where the specified task is likely to be performed. Only those implied tasks
   that require allocation of CBRN resources should be kept. Coordinating for water support to conduct
   decontamination operations is an example of this type of task.
   C-54. Essential CBRN tasks are those tasks that must be executed to accomplish the mission. Essential
   tasks drive the planning and allocation of assets. An example of an essential task is locating a bypass route
   for a vehicle to allow freedom of maneuver along an axis.

REVIEW AVAILABLE ASSETS
   C-55. The CBRN staff must determine what CBRN units and assets are available, including estimated
   supplies required to accomplish specified and implied tasks. They identify command and support
   relationships—organic, assigned, and attached. If insufficient assets are available to accomplish specified
   and implied tasks, alternative methods may be developed, additional assets may be requested, or the risk
   associated with failure to complete certain tasks may be determined. The CBRN staff must be prepared to
   provide the commander or operations staff officer with a description of the units, assets, and capabilities
   available for the mission.

DETERMINE CONSTRAINTS
   C-56. Higher headquarters normally places some constraints on subordinate units. Other constraints may
   take the form of a requirement or a prohibition to do something. Insufficient resources should be
   determined during the review of available assets; however the lack of resources is not necessarily a
   constraint.

IDENTIFY CRITICAL FACTS AND ASSUMPTIONS
   C-57. It is important to identify the following information as it relates to known CBRN intelligence
   indicators and enemy doctrine:
             Facts. Facts are statements containing known data about a situation, including enemy and
              friendly dispositions, unit strengths, and material readiness.
             Assumptions. Assumptions are suppositions assumed to be true in the absence of facts.




C-12                   ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                 28 February 2011
                                                                                          Planning Processes



CONDUCT RISK ASSESSMENT
   C-58. The commander and staff identify accident risks. The commander also makes an initial assessment of
   where he/she might accept tactical risk. The CBRN staff updates the vulnerability and MOPP analyses and
   advises the commander about accidental risk associated with the plan, tactical risks pertaining to CBRN
   defense and obscurants, and the risks of CBRN attacks and hazards.

DETERMINE THE INITIAL COMMANDER’S CRITICAL INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS
   C-59. CCIR identify information that the commander needs to support his/her battlefield visualization and
   to make critical decisions—especially to determine or validate COAs. CCIRs, which should be limited to
   10 items or less, consist of two types: priority intelligence requirements and essential elements of friendly
   information.

DETERMINE THE INITIAL INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE PLAN
   C-60. CBRN-templated areas of possible contamination that could affect operations are designated as
   NAIs. An NAI may be a specific point, route, terrorist target, industrial facility, or, in the case of a
   templated chemical strike, an area. The CBRN staff ensures that templated CBRN events become NAIs and
   are placed on the situation template for each COA. NAIs and other gaps in intelligence are addressed in a
   collection plan, in which responsibility for collecting information is assigned. Initial collection
   requirements are subsequently modified following the analysis of specific areas and activities that are
   expected to reveal the COA selected by the threat force.

UPDATE OPERATIONAL TIMELINE
   C-61. The commander and staff refine the initial timeline. They compare the time needed to accomplish
   essential tasks to the time allocated by higher headquarters. They also compare their timeline to the enemy
   timeline developed during the IPOE/IPB.

WRITE THE RESTATED MISSION
   C-62. The CBRN staff writes a restated CBRN mission directed at the CBRN assets assigned.

DELIVER A MISSION ANALYSIS BRIEFING
   C-63. The CBRN staff must know the status of subordinate and supporting units, and they must conduct a
   mission analysis briefing to relay relevant information. The unit SOP usually specifies the structure of the
   briefing.

APPROVE THE RESTATED MISSION
   C-64. Immediately after the mission analysis briefing, the commander approves a restated mission. This
   may be the restated mission recommended by the staff, a modified version of the staff recommendation, or
   a mission that the commander has developed. Once approved, the restated mission becomes the unit
   mission.

DEVELOP THE INITIAL COMMANDER’S INTENT
   C-65. Normally, the commander develops his/her intent during the mission analysis; he/she may modify
   that intent after the mission analysis briefing, if necessary. The commander’s intent is a clear, concise
   statement of what the force must do with respect to the enemy and terrain to achieve the desired end state.

ISSUE THE COMMANDER’S GUIDANCE
   C-66. The CBRN staff may recommend that particular items be included in the commander’s guidance.
   The guidance, once issued, directs the CBRN staff on the use of obscurants, reconnaissance,
   decontamination, MOPP, and other aspects of CBRN defense and obscuration operations.



   28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                            C-13
Appendix C



ISSUE A WARNING ORDER
   C-67. Examples of CBRN staff input to a warning order include—
           CBRN reconnaissance initiated (Fox and Biological Integrated Detection System).
           CBRN priorities and timelines.

REVIEW FACTS AND ASSUMPTIONS
   C-68. Because mission analysis is a continuous process, the CBRN staff officer must review the CBRN
   facts and assumptions to determine whether anything has changed. Whenever facts or assumptions change,
   the commander and staff must assess the impact of these changes on the plan and make the necessary
   adjustments.

COURSE-OF-ACTION DEVELOPMENT
   C-69. It is difficult to develop COAs that are complete, feasible, unique, consistent with doctrine, and in
   compliance with the commander’s guidance based on the results of the mission analysis. The CBRN staff
   fully participates in this process to ensure that CBRN defense and obscurant operations are properly
   integrated and synchronized with the tactical plan.
   C-70. Tasks performed by the CBRN staff during COA development include the following:
            Continue to refine the CBRN threat, providing input to one or more of the following intelligence
             staff products:
                 Situation template.
                 Event template.
                 Reconnaissance and surveillance plan.
                 Priority intelligence requirements.
            Develop a tentative plan for the integration of obscuration, decontamination, reconnaissance, and
             flame field-expedient assets that supports the developing COA scheme of maneuver.
            Complete the task organization of CBRN assets for each COA.
            Develop a unit vulnerability assessment. (See appendix B for vulnerability assessments.)
            Analyze the synchronization feasibility of artillery, mechanized, and potted obscuration units in
             support of each COA.
            Locate operational/thorough decontamination sites that support the scheme of maneuver
             throughout the depth of the AO.
            Develop a tentative plan for the movement of chemical defense equipment/protection equipment
             from combat trains to forward unit locations—particularly for light forces.
            Make recommendations, based on the commander’s guidance, for automatic masking criteria
             and FP measures, balancing the level of protection against the threat.
            Develop a tentative CBRN casualty management plan.
            Develop branch plans for avoidance. Based on a bypass decision by the commander, describe
             changes that will take place to the scheme of maneuver if confronted with contamination.
            Determine risk factors due to crossing contamination.
   C-71. After developing COAs, the staff may conduct a COA briefing. The optional COA briefing provides
   the CBRN staff with an opportunity to ensure that they followed the commander’s guidance correctly in
   developing COAs. A collaborative session facilitates the planning process by ensuring that the CBRN staff
   does not enter the war game or invest a lot of time and intellectual energy into a COA or multiple COAs
   that do not follow the commander’s intent.
   C-72. After the briefing, the commander may give additional guidance. If COAs are rejected, the CBRN
   staff begins again. If one or more of the COAs are accepted, CBRN staff members begin COA analysis.
   The commander may create a new COA by incorporating elements of one or more COAs developed by the
   staff. The CBRN staff then prepares to war-game this new COA.




C-14                   ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1               28 February 2011
                                                                                           Planning Processes



COURSE-OF-ACTION ANALYSIS (WAR GAMING)
  C-73. Following COA development, the CBRN staff analyzes each COA. The analysis consists of
  feasibility checks, war gaming, risk assessment, and comparisons of war-game results. War gaming results
  in the identification of tasks, combat power requirements, critical events, priority efforts, task organization,
  command and support relationships, decision points, and possible fratricide locations. The CBRN officer,
  along with the rest of the staff, assists in war-gaming each COA against the anticipated enemy action or
  reaction. The CBRN staff should be prepared to provide the following input, knowledge, or information
  during the war-gaming session:
             CBRN threat integration for each enemy COA.
             Available CBRN assets and an explanation of how they might be used to support each friendly
              COA.
             Unit vulnerability assessment.
  C-74. COA analysis assists the CBRN officer in completing the following actions and answering associated
  questions.
  C-75. Anticipate critical CBRN events/actions, and conduct vulnerability assessments, including probable
  targets and agent effects. Ask the following:
            Will concentrated friendly forces present a target whose contamination or destruction is worth
             the enemy expense of CBRN weapons?
            Are friendly forces located close to an industrial facility that could be a hazard?
            Does the enemy have time to locate, analyze, and attack before friendly forces can be displaced
             or dispersed?
            Will friendly forces be moving at such a rate of speed that the enemy cannot hit them?
            Will friendly forces be so close to enemy troops that the enemy will be required to violate
             doctrinal constraints to attack—or even contaminate themselves?
            What type of CBRN munitions (if nuclear, with what yield) will the enemy use to attack?
            What types of industrial compounds/substances are present at industrial facilities in the AO?
            Will the enemy use of chemical or nuclear weapons restrict maneuverability?
            Have possible chemical attack locations or possible industrial/chemical facility locations been
             identified during the action-reaction-counteraction phase of war gaming?
  C-76. Consider the initial deployment and focus of reconnaissance, decontamination, obscuration, and
  biological units. Produce a tentative CBRN defense overlay, to include unit employment and a concept for
  their use. Perform the following:
             Assign reconnaissance assets or subordinate units with reconnaissance elements to perform the
              reconnaissance of suspected chemical, biological, or radiological weapons/container locations
              and/or industrial facilities in the AO.
             Assign CBRN reconnaissance and biological units to cover critical CBRN-related NAIs
              identified during the war-gaming process.
             Assign CBRN reconnaissance units to monitor known civilian chemical/industrial hazards for
              possible damage that can affect friendly operations. Consider detection and protection
              capabilities.
             Assign decontamination assets or subordinate units with decontamination elements to perform
              the reconnaissance of possible water sites and decontamination locations in the AO.
             Assign decontamination units to plan decontamination operations in areas where chemical
              contamination may occur as a result of an enemy attack or contamination from an
              industrial/chemical facility.
             Coordinate with the fire support officer on obscurant missions to cover potential obscuration
              targets identified during the war-gaming process (suspected enemy observation points, river-
              crossing operations, deception operations).
             Tentatively develop the concept for CBRN support, and determine the critical CBRN priorities
              and tasks for subordinate units.



  28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                              C-15
Appendix C



              Tentatively determine CBRN task organization and command/support relationships.
              Integrate the CBRN collection plan into the intelligence collection plan.
              Recommend the MOPP level and provide operational exposure guidance that is consistent with
               mission accomplishment.
              Recommend locations for CBRN units and the headquarters command post.
   C-77. COA analysis (war gaming) is a disciplined process. It includes rules and steps that help commanders
   and staffs visualize the flow of an operation. The process considers friendly CBRN dispositions, strengths,
   and weaknesses; enemy CBRN assets and probable COAs; and characteristics of the AO. It relies heavily
   on an understanding of CBRN doctrine, tactical judgment, and experience. War gaming focuses CBRN
   staff attention on each phase of the operation in a logical sequence. It is an iterative process of action,
   reaction, and counteraction.

WAR-GAME BRIEFING (OPTIONAL)
   C-78. Time permitting, the CBRN staff delivers a briefing to ensure that everyone understands the results
   of the war game. This briefing is normally not given to the commander. The CBRN staff uses it for review
   and ensures that relevant points of the war game are captured for presentation to the commander in the
   COA decision briefing.

COURSE-OF-ACTION COMPARISON AND APPROVAL
   C-79. The CBRN staff considers the characteristics of CBRN planning, the principles of CBRN, and the
   commander’s guidance in analyzing and evaluating the COAs. The staff compares the COAs, determining
   the advantages and disadvantages of each. Based on the analysis and comparison, the staff presents
   recommendations and then briefs the commander. The commander may select a COA, select a modified
   COA, or reject the COAs—in which case the staff begins the process once again. (See figure C-3 for more
   information on all COA comparison.)

   C-80. The CBRN staff must compare COAs correctly to provide viable recommendations to the
   commander. Detailed analysis during comparison may identify a COA that satisfies the criteria better than
   one the staff believed was best.
   C-81. The actual comparison of COAs is critical. The CBRN staff may use a technique that facilitates
   reaching the best recommendation and helps the commander to make the best decision. The most common
   technique is the decision matrix, which uses evaluation criteria to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of
   each COA.
ORDERS DEVELOPMENT/PRODUCTION
   C-82. The CBRN staff produces a CBRN annex and provides input to the base order. (See figure C-4 for a
   sample annex.)

                                    Threat Assessments
       The CBRN threat assessment is an analysis of the likelihood that tactical units will
       confront CBRN threats and hazards. Consequently, CBRN threat assessments need to
       address avoidance, protection, and decontamination functions within a command AO
       and across the AOI. A deliberate adversarial CBRN threat is the possibility that some
       individual, state, or organization will attempt to harm U.S. military personnel or
       contaminate U.S. property through purposeful, often life-threatening action. Many
       CBRN hazards, however, originate from technological or natural disasters. The
       CBRN threat assessment must address potential threats and hazards.

THREATS AND HAZARDS
   D-1. Commanders and CBRN staffs must be prepared to go into any AO and perform their full range of
   missions while dealing with a wide range of CBRN threats and hazards, each with unique characteristics
   that could threaten the force. While conducting missions, military personnel may be at risk for exposure to
   the intentional use of CBRN weapons, the intentional or accidental release of TIM, or many environmental
   biological and radiological hazards.
   D-2. CBRN weapons and materials present different implications. CBRN threats are intentional and
   include enemy actions using CBRN weapons and accidents involving exposure to TIM. Assessments must
   include the impacts of weather and environmental conditions, including the potential for natural disasters,
   and the current level of health and sanitation in the AO. (See Potential Military Chemical/Biological
   Agents and Compounds and FM 4-02.7.)
   D-3. Potential CBRN hazards include, but are not limited to, chemical agents, biological agents, and
   radiological material that can cause death, serious bodily injury, or disfigurement. Hazards of concern
   include high and low levels of chemical warfare agents in air, soil, and water and are usually the result of
   an accidental release. To reduce vulnerabilities to CBRN hazards, commanders and CBRN staffs must
   continually assess the long- and short-range risks and the amount and manner of exposure that may produce
   such risks to identify prevention and mitigation strategies.

DELIBERATE-ADVERSARIAL THREAT ASSESSMENT
   D-4. The assessment of a deliberate-adversarial CBRN threat addresses three primary components:
   capability, opportunity, and intent. Capability is defined as the adversary’s capability to carry out a specific
   type of threat activity based on their ability to design, develop, or deliver the resources (weapon systems)
   used in that activity. The staff examines available intelligence on potential CBRN hazards, weapons
   systems, storage facilities, production facilities, research and development programs, and delivery methods.
   The assessment of an adversary’s capability involves several factors that require more specific information
   and will require ISR planning. An adversary capability assessment should address the following:
             Who. Type of adversary possessing CBRN weapons.
             What. Type of CBRN use.
             When. Timing for use in crises and conflicts.
             Where. Types and locations of targets.
             Why. Broad objectives for the use of CBRN weapons.
             How. Concept for CBRN employment.
   D-5. Opportunity is defined as the adversary’s opportunity to carry out an attack in relation to particular
   targets and the type of weapons or systems required to be effective against a target. The commander and
   CBRN staff assess factors (when, where, and how an adversary may use a CBRN weapon or agent).


28 February 2011        ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                                  D-1
Appendix D


      Planners consider the weather, terrain, operational boundaries, defensive posture, and other factors to assess
      when or where an adversary may attack. An adversary may attack by—
               Overt means. Overt means include the application of overt systems (aircraft, cruise missiles,
                unmanned aircraft systems/remotely piloted vehicles, tactical ballistic missiles, small boats)
                against operational-level targets.
               Covert releases. Covert releases include, but are not limited to, various improvised CBRN
                devices or contamination of resources (drinking water).
      D-6. Intent is defined as adversary goals, purpose, or aims, including the decisions required and means to
      achieve those goals, in terms of desired targets and effects. Commanders and CBRN staff conduct an
      assessment of adversary intent to use CBRN weapons. Adversary intent may be to cause casualties,
      contamination, degradation, or panic or to demonstrate its ability to attack anywhere, at any time.

ACCIDENT OR NATURAL-DISASTER THREAT ASSESSMENT
      D-7. Major accidents and natural disasters occur on a continuing basis and may involve CBRN agents or
      materials. A tactical unit should conduct direct observation to obtain information on the industrialization in
      their AO or gather intelligence on other hazards within the AOI. For example, a vast array of toxic
      industrial facilities may exist in or near the AO.

IMPACT ASSESSMENT
      D-8. Planners assess the impact of a CBRN attack or incident on the AOR. Attack templates identify
      whether the attack is conducted on or off the installation. Attack scenarios could include points source
      attacks on an AOR or line source attacks upwind of the target. The impact assessment may occur at the
      installation level by using decision support tools or exercising technical reachback.

OPERATIONAL-ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT
      D-9. Planners assess civil-military considerations to identify the type of OE. The OE may be permissive,
      uncertain, or hostile:
                Permissive. The military and/or law enforcement agencies should have the control, intent, and
                 capability to assist operations.
                Uncertain. The host government forces, whether opposed or receptive to operations, probably
                 do not have effective control of the territory and population in the intended AO.
                Hostile. Adversarial forces have a degree of control, the intent, and the capability to effectively
                 oppose or react to operations.

PREVIOUS-INCIDENT/PAST-USE ASSESSMENT
      D-10. The planner collects information on previous uses of CBRN agents or weapons and accidents that
      may have occurred in the AO. The planner’s assessment also considers how an AOR may be affected by
      secondary hazards from accidental, incidental, or intentional releases by enemies or U.S. forces. Given the
      prevalence of TIM throughout the world, civilian and DOD planners should use area studies and integrate
      intelligence estimates to assess possible hazards.
      D-11. CBRN threat assessment considers the full spectrum of CBRN threats and hazards (natural, criminal,
      terrorist, accidental) for a given facility/location. The CBRN threat assessment should examine supporting
      information to evaluate the likelihood of occurrence for each threat.
      D-12. CBRN threat assessments help commanders make better-informed decisions about which protective
      measures to adopt. They do so by identifying the most likely CBRN threats that units and personnel will
      face, allowing units to identify the protective and vulnerability reduction measures most likely to keep them
      safe. When deciding on protective and vulnerability reduction measures, commanders and staffs face two
      competing goals:
                Effectiveness. Effectiveness is adopting appropriate protective measures that will protect units
                 from specific threats that they are most likely to face.




D-2                        ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                 28 February 2011
                                                                                        Threat Assessments


            Efficiency. Efficiency is avoiding the adoption of unnecessary protective measures that have
             significant “costs” (financial costs or diversion of staff time, effort, and focus).
   D-13. CBRN threat assessment is not a one-time event, but a process of continuous reevaluation of CBRN
   threats and hazards throughout each cycle of the operations process to ensure that units continue to have
   appropriate protective measures in place. Units should—
             Conduct an initial CBRN threat assessment when operations begin and then adopt the
              appropriate protective measures.
             Update the CBRN threat assessment at regular intervals (to help avoid subconsciously becoming
              habituated to previously identified threats and hazards) and whenever threats or hazards change.
             Change CBRN protective measures as appropriate.
   D-14. The CBRN threat status is a flexible system used to assign the threat a serial number that is
   determined by the most current enemy situation as depicted by the continuously updated IPOE/IPB process.
   This system allows local commanders to increase the threat status as conditions change in their AO. Threat
   status governs the initial deployment of CBRN assets (equipment, units) and the positioning of those assets
   in the AO. The probability of threat is defined below.

Serial 1 (Zero Probability)
   D-15. The opposing force does not possess CB defense equipment, is not trained in CB defense or
   employment, and does not possess the capability to employ CB warfare agents or systems. Further, the
   opposing force is not expected to gain access to such weapons; and if they were able to acquire these
   weapons, it is considered highly unlikely that the weapons would be employed against U.S. forces.
   D-16. Under this status, a deploying force would not have to carry CB defense equipment or
   decontamination assets. However, protective masks should be carried. CBRN personnel should concentrate
   efforts on monitoring threat communication channels for CB threat indicators.

Serial 2 (Low Probability)
   D-17. The opposing force has an offensive CB capability and has received training in defense and
   employment techniques, but there is no indication of the use of CB weapons in the immediate future. An
   indication may be the dispersal or deployment of CB munitions or the stated objectives and intent of
   opposing forces.
   D-18. Given this threat status, two options are available: personnel carry their individual protective
   equipment, or chemical defense equipment stockpiles are identified and readily available for deployment to
   the operational area if the threat status should increase. CBRN reconnaissance systems deploy to the
   operational AOI to provide a monitoring capability. Chemical personnel continue to concentrate their
   efforts on CBRN planning and analysis for threat indicators.

Serial 3 (Medium Probability)
   D-19. The opposing force is equipped and trained in CB defense and employment techniques. CB weapons
   and employment systems are readily available. CB weapons have been employed in other areas of the
   theater. The continued employment of CB weapons is considered probable in the immediate future.
   Indicators would be as follows:
             CB munitions deployed to field storage sites or firing units.
             Enemy troops wearing or carrying protective equipment.
             CB reconnaissance elements observed with conventional reconnaissance units.
             CB decontamination elements moved forward.




   28 February 2011      ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                            D-3
Appendix D


      D-20. Unit CB defense equipment should be prepalletized and located forward for easy access or issued to
      the Service members who are responsible for their use within the unit. Individual Service members should
      be at MOPP1 or MOPP2 and MOPP0, if MOPP gear is readily available. Erect collective-protection
      systems if the tactical situation permits. Personnel and equipment should be kept under cover as much as
      possible to protect them from contamination. Chemical downwind messages should be sent to subordinate
      units. Decontamination assets, CB reconnaissance assets, and obscuration support should be deployed as
      part of the force structure. Detection and monitoring equipment should be issued to the operators. Units
      should prepare/distribute decontamination equipment.

Serial 4 (High Probability)
      D-21. The opposing force possesses CB warfare agents and delivery systems. CB defense equipment is
      available and training status is considered at par or better than that of U.S. forces. CB weapons have
      already been employed in the theater, and attack is considered imminent. Indicators are—
                CB attack in progress, but not in the current AO.
                CB warnings/signals to enemy troops.
                CB munitions delivered to firing units within range of friendly forces.
                Movement of surface-to-surface missiles to a launch site.
      D-22. Unfortunately, this traditional approach to threat levels—using one threat level chart as the only
      assessment technique—can be problematic. Merely describing the threat as high, medium, low, or zero
      probability can be dangerous. These terms mean different things to different people and are, by themselves,
      not useful in identifying appropriate protective measures. If the CBRN threat level is tied inextricably to a
      set of protective procedures that must be implemented, the procedures adopted may be inappropriate
      because they do not consider the types of CBRN incidents, the situation in which they will be encountered,
      their cause, and the likelihood that they will be faced.
      D-23. The CBRN threat assessment provides five types of information about the CBRN threats and hazards
      a unit may face:
               Types of CBRN attacks. There are intentional and unintentional releases. Units may take
                different types of precautions against conventional warfare agents and industrial releases.
               CBRN threat situations. Threats may be encountered on installations, in urban environments,
                aboard watercraft, and other locations. Faced with the threat of a CBRN release or attack, units
                may take different precautions at installations (collective protection) than they would when
                conducting operations in combative territories (shelter in place).
               CBRN threat causes. The following are the main causes that define the threat environment:
                    Crime/banditry. These actions (pranks) are taken by persons with malicious or personal
                     motivations not connected with larger political or military efforts.
                    Direct threats. These actions are taken by a belligerent (usually to aid in a political or
                     military effort) for which U.S. territories, faculties, or units are the intended target (attacking
                     a naval base).
                    Indirect threats. These actions are taken by a belligerent for which the local population or
                     other belligerents are the intended target, but military units are unintentionally affected
                     (military units hitting an improvised chemical device on a road).
               CBRN threat level. This is defined as the likelihood that a unit will face a threat (high, medium,
                or low). Faced with the possibility of adversarial assault, limited protective measures may be
                adopted if there is a low threat, but extensive protective measures (collective protection) may be
                adopted if there is a high threat.
               Potential changes in the CBRN threat or hazard. As an example, the protective measures you
                adopted for a situation with a credible nuclear missile threat will no longer be appropriate if
                there is a new biological warfare agent threat.
      D-24. The CBRN staff incorporates CBRN-related intelligence collection information into the ISR efforts
      to collect the required information and to confirm or deny enemy COAs. Templated targets are designated
      as NAIs that may confirm or deny a particular enemy activity. NAIs are shown on the collection plan. (See
      figure D-1 for a sample collection plan.)

   The CBRN and intelligence staffs and the surgeon provide the indicators for each NAI.
   D-26. The CBRN staff addresses the effects of the OE on CBRN operations (soil type, surface drainage,
   vegetation type and distribution, precipitation, wind patterns, temperature, humidity, cloud cover,
   topography). This information is key for CBRN staffs to conduct a CBRN hazard assessment. These
   variables affect agent and radiation persistency and effectiveness and possible contamination areas.

   D-27. Upon completion of the initial CBRN threat assessment, the staff recommends changes or revises the
   CBRN threat condition, allowing the unit, activity, installation, base, ship, or port the opportunity to take
   the appropriate measures commensurate with the estimated severity of the existing CBRN threat level. (See
   table D-1, page D-6, for a CBRN threat condition matrix that provides standards for assessing the level of
   CBRN threat and the protective actions necessary according to STANAG 2984.)

  D-28. CBRN threat assessments must be continuously updated to ensure that protective measures remain
  appropriate; therefore, the threat condition is also continually updated to reflect the heightened or lowered
  capabilities of a force. A unit CBRN threat condition may change based on—
            The IPOE/IPB reassessments of adversary intent.
            The implementation of vulnerability reduction measures.
            The reduction of protective capabilities.
            A change in friendly-force capabilities (increased CBRN training and enhanced proficiency).
  D-29. Throughout the CBRN threat assessment process, information has been gathered to make one final
  determination—the probability of the use of CBRN weapons or an accidental release.
  D-30. A CBRN threat assessment of the probability of the use of CBRN weapons (low, medium, or high) is
  input for the vulnerability analysis process and other information developed in the vulnerability assessment.
  (See appendix B for vulnerability assessments.) The vulnerability analysis process is used to determine the
  overall vulnerability and risk to land, sea, and air forces. (See figures D-2 through D-5, pages D-8 through
  D-11 for estimations on the probability of use of CB agents and nuclear and radiological weapons.) (See
  figure D-6, page D-12, for a sample CBRN threat assessment summary.)

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
THREAT ASSESSMENT PROCESS
  D-31. Commanders and staffs must consider the CBRN threat assessment during the planning, preparation,
  and execution process. The CBRN threat assessment process is continuous and directly tied to the
  commander’s decisions throughout the conduct of operations. The CBRN threat assessment considers—
          Who. The first step in conducting a threat assessment is to identify the adversary. The number of
           nations capable of developing and possessing CBRN weapons is steadily increasing, and it is
           very difficult to form assessments of nations or groups that have the capability to employ agents.
               CBRN-capable nations. A CBRN-capable nation is one that has the capability to produce
                or acquire and employ one or more types of CBRN weapons to achieve political and
                military objectives. Inherent in this capability are varying degrees of abilities to conduct
                research and development; improve technology; and stockpile, weaponize, and deliver
                CBRN weapons.
               CBRN-capable groups or individuals. There is significant intelligence and factual data to
                support the contention that terrorist groups or individuals are also attempting to obtain
                CBRN capabilities—and succeeding.

        Note. The March 1995 sarin attack in the Tokyo subway by the Aum Shinrikyo religious cult
        demonstrated this capability.

           What. An assessment of the adversary CBRN capability that may be used will likely depend on
            adversary goals. For example, adversary-induced releases in the operational area could be
            low-technology, high-impact events intended only to disrupt or halt operations. Each CBRN
            capability has advantages and disadvantages.
               Chemical. The effects of chemical agents are primarily casualty-producing effects and
                contamination. The personnel performance degradation produced by the prolonged wear of
                MOPP gear can also have a significant impact on friendly forces. (See Multiservice Tactics,
                Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Protection for a
                detailed explanation of MOPP levels.)
               Biological. Biological agents can produce large numbers of casualties. Additional effects
                resulting from a biological attack (infectious diseases, mass casualties, large-area effects,
                degradation from MOPP gear wear, restriction of movement) can also have significant
                impacts on friendly forces.

 Subject: Corps CBRN Treat Assessment and Summary

 1.    (U) Purpose. To provide forces with the monthly CBRN threat assessment and summary to attempt to forecast
       potential CBRN threats, hazards, and enemy intent for the next 30 to 60 days to develop mitigation measures
       necessary to protect the force.

 2.    (U) Overall Assessment.
       a. (U) THREATCON Levels. The Corps CBRN threat assessment working group continues to assess the overall
            CBRN attack threat as low. Minimum MOPP is ready. See the table below for the CBRN THREATCON levels:

                            Chemical                       White/Green/Amber/Red/Black
                            Biological                     White/Green/Amber/Red/Black
                            Radiological                   White/Green/Amber/Red/Black
                            Nuclear                        White/Green/Amber/Red/Black
                            Weaponized hazardous           White/Green/Amber/Red/Black
                            materials

                            White                          Negligible
                            Green                          Possible
                            Amber                          Probable
                            Red                            Imminent
                            Black                          Attack has already occurred

       b.   (U) Capability. Enemy forces possess the ability to employ conventional chemical weapons, but appear to have
            limited stockpiles. They do not possess the technology to employ biological weapons or radiological-dispersal
            systems, but reportedly have been experimenting with methods to use toxic industrial chemical-enhanced IEDs on
            coalition forces. (No change.)
       c.   (U) Opportunity. Although the normal cold temperatures and humidity this time of year could be favorable for
            using chemical weapons, the extreme wind speeds and unpredictable wind direction cancels its potential
            effectiveness against coalition forces in desert and mountainous terrain. However, large urban areas with tight
            building structures, narrow streets, and narrow valleys will tend to favor the duration of nonpersistent chemical
            agents. With the enemy in a defensive mode of the past several months, limited offensive chemical strikes against
            coalition targets or covert employment of TIC-enhanced IED might be seen as a timely option.
       d.   (U) Intent. Currently, national army leaders do not appear to be willing to support an offensive campaign of this
            nature due to significant CB defense training and equipment shortfalls. Independently operating local militia or
            rogue elements are spread thin, disorganized, and poorly equipped, but seem to be looking for new ways to flex
            their muscle.

 3.    (U) Trend Summary. Small to medium caches of conventional chemical munitions are still being found on the average
       of 1 every 6 to 8 weeks, which is a significant decrease from this time last year. No new IED manufacturing facilities
       containing potential chemical rounds or TIC have been found in the last 3 months.

                                              [Insert a chart or spreadsheet if available]

 4.    (U) Potential Enemy COA.
       a. (U) Chemical Weapons. National army forces may employ conventional chemical weapons using artillery in
            delivery systems or tied in with IEDs. Potential targets would be along main supply routes, at ports, and in forward
            operating bases. Rogue elements may also attempt to use conventional chemical weapons or TIC-enhanced
            IEDs in urban areas to cause widespread fear and panic.
       b. (U) Biological Weapons. N/A.
       c. (U) Radiological-Dispersal Devices. N/A.

 5.    (U) Enemy Most Likely COA. Due to the increased disruption of enemy C2 systems, field commanders will most likely
       not be able to carry out offensive operations using conventional chemical weapons. Rogue elements continue to face
       many challenges and may seriously consider taking the opportunity to demonstrate power to gain some much-needed
       momentum. Increased experimental use of TIC-enhanced IEDs in urban areas will most likely be the greatest threat to
       coalition forces. Due to the low temperatures and restricted terrain, chemicals may be somewhat effective in causing
       many casualties on both civilians and coalition forces.

6.   (U) Enemy Most Dangerous COA. The enemy employment of chemical weapons on seaports of entry would be the most
     devastating to coalition forces in terms of sheer military and civilian casualties and the long-term disruption of logistics
     support.

7.   (U) Neighboring Countries and Transnational Entities. Covert assistance on the northern border in the form of
     chemical weapons or weaponized hazardous materials is possible, but not likely at this time. There have been no reports
     of any such activity.

8.   (U) Vulnerability or Former WMD Sites. All known WMD storage and production facilities have been destroyed or are
     under direct coalition control.

9.   (U) Weather Impacts on CBRN Agents.
     a. (U)Temperature. Average temperatures are 5°C, which is favorable.
     b. (U) Humidity. Relative humidity is 25 percent, which is favorable.
     c. (U) Wind Speed. Average wind speed is 15 to 20 mph, which is favorable.

10. (U) Key events. 1 Dec 09, medium-sized cache (30 rounds) of unmarked munitions were found. Several of them were
    leaking. Two Soldiers experienced redness of the skin on their hands and face and were evacuated to the nearest MTF.
    The presence of a blister agent in 5 of the rounds was identified using ICAM and confirmed with hazardous materials
    identification.

11. (U) CBRN Defense Assets.

                      Radiological and nuclear. The effects of a nuclear detonation are primarily in three areas:
                       thermal radiation, blast, and radiological. Additional effects (electromagnetic pulse) can
                       break down electronics system protection, disrupt communications, and have a significant
                       psychological impact on friendly forces. The short- and long-term effects of radiological
                       exposure of personnel must be monitored to minimize the degradation of individual and unit
                       performance.
                      Unintentional releases. The effects of unintentional releases can produce casualties in
                       humans and animals and damage plants, wildlife, and other material. Consequences from an
                       unintentional release (infectious diseases, mass casualties, large-area effects, restriction of
                       movement, contamination, degradation from MOPP gear wear, quarantine) can have
                       significant impacts on friendly forces. Unintentional releases can also have long-term
                       effects on personnel and the natural environment.

             When. Understanding adversary CBRN weapons employment concepts can enhance the ability
              to predict if and when an adversary may use CBRN weapons. Many of the former Soviet-
              influenced doctrinal precepts have been learned by potential enemies and still remain even after
              the end of the Cold War; however, defining when an adversary may use CBRN weapons largely
              remains only an estimate. The enemy employment of CBRN weapons could occur at unexpected
              times and locations.
             Where.
                  Ports, airfields, supply depots, railheads, maintenance facilities, and major command
                   headquarters are potential targets for CBRN attacks. Fixed-site commanders and staffs will
                   assess their vulnerability and may use vulnerability checklists to support that process.
                  Enemy forces operating in the rear area could contaminate critical command headquarters or
                   supply facilities and significantly affect the responsiveness of support organizations.
                   Additionally, because of the proliferation of CBRN weapons, future campaign locations
                   may be fought on an asymmetric battlefield.
             Why. The motivation behind the threat to use CBRN weapons can assist the commander and
              his/her staff in assessing adversary intent to use CBRN weapons. The motivation to use these
              weapons may be to cause casualties, contamination, or degradation or strictly for the
              psychological impact. For example, the psychological impact of CBRN weapons may cause
              panic or mob behavior among civilians.
             How. The employment of CBRN weapons may depend on the perceived advantage gained by
              their use at the tactical level.
                  Persistent and nonpersistent agents. The use of nonpersistent agents against front-line
                   positions or against amphibious forces operating in littoral (situated or growing on or near a
                   shore) areas; use of persistent agents on bypassed positions, strong points, and flanks; or use
                   of persistent or nonpersistent chemical agents in barrier and denial plans could impact
                   operations. These tactics may be favored by combatants from developing nations who have
                   adequate chemical stocks and use former Soviet doctrine.
                  Radiological agents. The select use of casualty-producing biological agents could cause
                   casualties within hours versus days.
                  Nuclear devices. The use of tactical nuclear devices could cause large numbers of
                   casualties, damage, and contamination through thermal radiation, blast, and nuclear
                   radiation. Injuries to personnel can range from skin burns and flash blindness to radiation
                   sickness, extreme psychological effects, and death.
   D-32. CBRN battle staffs and subordinate leaders help commanders by monitoring the numerous factors
   that can influence the outcome of operations and by providing timely information that is needed for
   decisions. They focus their assessments on identified effects and specified tasks issued to subordinates.
   Generally, the level at which a specific operation, task, or action is directed should be the level at which it
   is assessed. This reduces redundancy and enhances the efficiency of the overall assessment process.
   D-33. Most of the information required for CBRN threat assessments will not be based on personal,
   firsthand experience. The following techniques are used to obtain this information (each approach has its
   own strengths and limitations; therefore, it is important to use all four together to conduct a credible threat
   assessment).
             Conducting interviews. Careful, structured interviews on the CBRN threats or hazards other
              units have faced can provide human intelligence, basic information, and a frame of reference for
              focusing other CBRN assessment techniques. In some cases, this approach will not lead to
              meaningful conclusions because the validity of answers to the questions is unknown. (See table
              D-2 for other questions that may indicate whether the information is accurate.)

About the person providing the information:
    •     Does he/she have direct access to the information?
    •     Has information that he/she reported in the past been reliable?
    •     Does he/she believe you could verify the information?
    •     Will he/she benefit from your reaction to the information?
    •     Does he/she expect to have a continuing relationship with you?
    •     Have you known him/her for some time?
About the information:
   •     Does it make sense, given what you already know about the situation?
    •     Do you have information consistent with it?
    •     Do you have information that contradicts it?

              Analyzing patterns and trends. The examination of quantitative information on past CBRN
               incidents helps identify the most common features of CBRN incidents (patterns) and changes in
               them (trends). Pattern/trend analysis may yield sufficiently reliable and specific information on
               threats (what areas or types of units are attacked) on which to base protective measures. A
               CBRN incident data collection worksheet can help collect data and present it clearly for analysis.
               (See figure D-7 for a sample CBRN incident data collection worksheet.)

              Gauging the threat level. CBRN threat levels serve as markers for establishing the level of
               CBRN threat posed by an adversary. In most instances, you will not be able to draw exclusively
               on pattern/trend analysis to gauge the CBRN threat level; therefore, the CBRN staff must
               develop information for integration into the various staff estimates. There are many such factors
               for each of the three major causes of threats.
              Looking for indicators that CBRN threats may change. Threat indicators and events that
               suggest possible changes in the CBRN threat or hazard environment are useful tools for
               considering future CBRN threats.
   D-34. The CBRN threat to military forces from terrorist organizations is not definitive. Intelligence
   reporting indicates that nearly 40 terrorist organizations, insurgent groups, or cults have used, possessed, or
   expressed an interest in CBRN agents or weapons. However, the level of competence of these terrorist
   organizations in developing and effectively employing CBRN is not well understood. It is also true that
   military forces present challenges that might cause a terrorist to consider, more favorably, a softer, civilian
   target. Nevertheless, military resources are vital to national security and it is prudent to provide a
   responsible level of CBRN protection to military personnel and infrastructure that balances the cost of
   providing that protection with the security improvements that result.

   28 February 2011         ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                           D-15
Appendix D


   D-35. The CBRN staff must analyze the protection level required for friendly forces to withstand a CB
   attack. This information is vital to the commander for the successful accomplishment of the mission
   because the commander may be required to reallocate or reposition units in the AO to reduce vulnerability
   to an attack. The appropriate protection level is established by analyzing the following mission,
   environment, and warfighter factors:
            Mission and commander’s intent for friendly forces.
            Capabilities and level of training of friendly forces.
            MOPP analysis and work degradation factors contained in Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and
             Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Protection.
            Availability of chemical defense equipment and decontamination assets. In this regard,
             information may be obtained from the plans staff officer.
            Location and availability of desalination plants (for arid areas).
            Location of civilian chemical manufacturing and storage facilities. Chemicals at these facilities
             may be used, through civilian contract, for supplementary decontamination supplies. Further,
             chemicals or hazardous materials stored in these facilities may produce areas of contamination if
             storage containers leak (intentional or unintentional).
            Availability of civilian contracted labor and water transport for decontamination operations.
            Location of car washes for urban areas. Car washes may be used in lieu of hasty
             decontamination stations.
            Data on local fire hydrants (location and hookups). Hydrants may be used to provide water for
             decontamination operations.

CHECKLIST
   D-36. Principal CBRN staff elements of operational and tactical commands can use a checklist to evaluate
   the readiness of assigned forces; commanders and staffs may use the checklist for characterizing and
   dealing with CBRN threats and hazards while conducting multi-Service military operations. This checklist
   is not all-inclusive and is organized to provide a series of considerations and questions that will provide
   insight into functional area readiness. (See Table D-3 for CBRN threat assessment checklist questions.)

                Table D-3 CBRN threat assessment checklist questions (continued)
       Do we have the capability to monitor for changes to the threat and rapidly disseminate major
       changes?
       What types and ranges of CBRN agents does the threat force possess?
       Where are the threat CBRND forces and CBRN weapons and delivery systems?
       When can those systems affect the unit in the OE?
       Do the commander, CBRN staff officer, and unit leaders integrate and link good environmental
       actions to sound tactical doctrine and TTP as the standard for military operations?
       Are military actions for environmental protection an essential part of military planning, training,
       and assessment operations?
       Are environmental threats to population safety and well-being recognized? (U.S. and HN citizens
       value and demand a clean and healthy environment.)
       As described in NEPA, are the environmental consequences of the commanders’ proposed
       actions considered before making decisions?
       The level of environmental consideration exercised depends on the scope of the action, the extent
       of public interest, and the potential for environmental impacts. Are leaders consulting operational
       staff on NEPA- and HN-related issues? (NEPA concerns are usually installation- or operational-
       level unit considerations.)
       Major accidents and natural disasters occur on a continuing basis and may involve CBRN agents
       and materials. Are potential, naturally occurring hazards that may affect operations (recent
       outbreaks of illness or contaminated patients in hospitals) identified?
       What is the time period of interest?
       What are adversary probable threat COAs and intent?
       What are the NAIs and TAIs?
       What is the summary of enemy activity, including CBRN attacks, movements of CBRN equipment
       or material, presence and level of training of threat forces, or indicators of enemy CBRN warfare
       interest (queuing-up weather radar)?
       What is the direction and speed of prevailing winds?

       munitions?
       What is the availability and location of industrial assets capable of producing and/or weaponizing
       CBRN warfare agents?

       What are the casualty percentages, based on target size?
       What are the casualty percentages, based on weapon systems?
       What is the availability of CBRND equipment to enemy forces? (If no protective equipment is
       available [MOPP, antidotes, masks], it may indicate that the enemy does not intend to use CBRN
       weapons).
       What is the amount of overhead cover or COLPRO shelters or systems? (If enemy forces seek
       overhead cover or move into COLPRO shelters, it may indicate that the enemy intends to use
       CBRN weapons.)
       What is the stated national policy or philosophy on the use of CBRN weapons? Has the enemy
       declared a policy of no use, first use, or limited use only for retaliation in kind? Does the enemy
       consider the use of flame or OBS as CBRN agents?
       Is the enemy national or military leadership willing to use CBRN weapons on their own territory or
       expose their own populations to the hazards generated by CBRN munitions?

                 Table D-3. CBRN threat assessment checklist questions (continued)
       What is the future potential for CBRN use? If the enemy does not possess CBRN munitions, the
       capability to produce agents, or expertise to employ munitions, have attempts been made to gain
       this ability? (Reports indicating the presence of advisors from other nations working with enemy
       forces, international trade agreements, or shipments of agricultural equipment [sprayers,
       fertilizers, insecticides, or raw chemicals] may provide insight in to enemy intent.)

    operations staff officer. However, AOIs that require collaboration with the surgeon general, public affairs,
    civil-military operations, and legal staffs are also included. The questions that follow will lead to
    identification of mission areas that are strongly postured for dealing with CBRN threats and hazards or
    capabilities that are in need of improvement. (See tables D-4 through D-7, pages D-20 through D-23, for
    additional CBRN threat assessment considerations.)

                               Operational Environment
       This appendix provides an overview of the OE. It introduces the operational variables
       of PMESII/PMESII-PT that provide relevant information for use by CBRN staffs,
       units, and individuals at the tactical level. The DOD defines an operational
       environment as a composite of the conditions, circumstances, and influences that
       affect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander.

   E-1. The complex framework in which the United States views the adversary and the adversary views the
   United States is an OE consisting of PMESII/PMESII-PT variables. The joint systems approach described
   in JP 3-0 is only valid for joint force campaign planning; however, understanding the PMESII/PMESII-PT
   variables enables commanders, CBRN staffs, and unit leaders to visualize an OE beyond the traditional
   military paradigms. The PMESII/PMESII-PT variables provide a framework for understanding,
   characterizing, and managing CBRN threats and hazards in a specific OE; assessing actions needed to
   determine the range of possible CBRN effects; and planning chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear
   defense (CBRND) and vulnerability reduction measures encompassing various lines of operation to achieve
   tactical objectives.
   E-2. Vertical and horizontal SA increases the understanding of an OE, providing the basis for
   decisionmaking. It ensures an adequate understanding of oneself, the enemy, the terrain, and other aspects
   of the OE.
   E-3. During mission analysis at the tactical level, METT-TC/METT-T analysis methodologies focus more
   narrowly on the mission, enemy, troops, time, terrain, and civil considerations. Tactical-level
   responsibilities and execution enable the force to survive, fight, and win under CBRN conditions.
   E-4. Commanders will use the conditions of their OE as planning considerations for inclusion in tactical-
   level plans and exercises. The tactical setting for U.S. military operations is a diverse and complex OE that
   includes the PMESII/PMESII-PT variables.
   E-5. The elements and the attributes of the PMESII/PMESII-PT systems, tactically translated into METT-
   TC/METT-T domains, collectively form the basis for the complete OE, including friendly and enemy
   forces and other actors or elements that have been identified and selected for representation in the
   operational cycle of planning, preparation, execution, and assessment. Incorporating relevant information
   from the analysis of the variables into METT-TC/METT-T emphasizes OE human aspects, most obviously
   in civil considerations, but in the other factors as well. This requires critical thinking, collaboration,
   continuous learning, and adaptation.

VARIABLES
   E-6. Consideration of the variables of PMESII/PMESII-PT can lead to the identification of key CBRN
   nodes, links, and vulnerabilities. When the adversary is a state, all of these variables will be present, with
   many of them possessing tangible infrastructure that is easily identified by ISR. When the adversary is a

Appendix E



      nonstate actor, these same variables will be present to varying degrees, but the nature of the variables may
      be quite different. Nonstate actors are organized in a fundamentally different way than states, and they
      manifest themselves in completely different ways. However, the utility of the PMESII/PMESII-PT
      construct remains, even when the adversary is a nonstate actor. For deterrence, the political, psychological,
      and economic characteristics of an OE assume increased importance at the operational and tactical levels.
      For example, on the political scale, if an adversary has possessed CBRN weapons during past crises, it
      becomes important to understand the effect of those weapons on region politics and their effects on the
      decision to use or withhold such weapons.

POLITICAL
      E-7. The political environment addresses political decisions made during the conduct of military
      operations and their strategic, operational, and tactical implications. Likewise, the impact of each strategic,
      operational, and tactical action directly or indirectly affects the political variables of an OE. On the
      psychological scale, it is vital to understand adversary motivations and values to estimate the pressure that
      the adversary might feel to use or withhold CBRN weapons in a particular situation. Political,
      psychological, and economic considerations that influence deterrence may be the dominant factors
      influencing the adversary COAs.

National/Strategic Considerations
      E-8. U.S. military forces do not function independent of political policy and the desires of the people; they
      reflect the national values and obey the laws. Therefore, the U.S. military must have skills and programs for
      environmental protection. At this level, adversary analysis of strategic capabilities will concentrate on
      considerations (psychology of political leadership, national will and morale, ability of the economy to
      sustain warfare, possible willingness to use CBRN weapons, possible intervention by third-party countries
      and nonstate groups).

Operational/Tactical Considerations
      E-9. Warfighters must be prepared to operate and respond across the full spectrum of military operations
      and activities, to include homeland defense. From combat to humanitarian operations (in the four
      operational categories of offense, defense, stability, and support) the CBRND planner must be able to
      recommend—to the combatant, joint task force (JTF), or unit commander—measures that conform to
      environmental protection requirements—without impairing combat effectiveness. U.S. forces will
      increasingly operate in or near urban and populated environments. They must be able to execute combat
      operations; apply protection measures appropriate to the situation; and conform to laws, regulations, and
      international agreements.

Other Considerations
      E-10. The political structure is an overlay of formal and informal organizations. Other factors (treaties,
      international law, the capability of adversary propaganda to influence U.S. public support, world opinion)
      are also addressed. Determine the following:
                Is the threat force a treaty or agreement signatory?
                Are there significant moral or religious sanctions for or against the use of CBRN weapons by the
                 threat force?

MILITARY
      E-11. The military variable looks at essential aspects of the OE (armed forces, security forces, insurgent
      groups, paramilitary organizations, criminal groups). It includes an analysis of the specific AO in terms of
      military objectives; avenues of approach; and the effects of a CBRN environment on personnel, military
      operations, weapons systems, and force mobility.

                                                                                     Operational Environment



  E-12. Munitions are increasingly lethal, and target acquisition systems are more precise. The proliferation
  of CBRN weapon systems requires the commander to integrate the capabilities of highly modernized
  organizations with less-modernized and multinational units.
  E-13. Commanders must also realize that they do not have a monopoly on advanced technology. Even
  adversaries lacking research and development programs can purchase sophisticated systems in the global
  marketplace and gain selected parity or superiority to U.S. systems. Determine the following:
            What is the tactical-level assessment of the military adversary in terms of capability, disposition,
             tactics, and training status?
            What tactical units or factional groups could interfere with mission accomplishment?
            What is the size and location of the AO?
            What is the physical location of adversary land, air, naval, space, and other forces that could
             pose a direct threat to the security of the friendly force or the success of its mission?
            What types of CBRN weapons, obscurants, and delivery means do the threat forces possess?
            What are the minimum and maximum ranges of the various threat force delivery systems?
            Where are the TIMs located, and how might the threat forces employ them?
            Where are the units that possess the delivery systems located, and where are their command
             posts and communications nodes?
            What types of CBRN protection and detection equipment does the threat force have?
            What type of CBRN protective posture does the threat force exhibit?
            Is threat force CBRN weapon employment terrain-oriented, force-oriented, or a combination of
             both?
            What details are available regarding previous uses of CBRN weapons by the threat force—
             especially during recent operations?
            Are there probable employment indicators?
            What is the intent of the threat force? Is the threat force willing and able to operate in a
             contaminated environment?

ECONOMIC
  E-14. The economic variable looks at the formal economy, including production, distribution,
  consumption, labor force, and trade. Determine the following:
          What is the impact of trade outside the control of the government in goods and services,
           including illegal trade?
          What industrial and technological capabilities exist?
          Is the adversary interdependent within the nation or region?
          If social structure is an overlay of identity and affinity groups—
               How do members of this society construct their identities?
               Do the threat forces have allies that might enhance their capabilities or trading partners that
                might sell weapons to them?
               Do the threat forces have a history of CBRN use?

INFORMATION
  E-15. The information environment includes information derived from nongovernmental individuals and
  organizations (the media) that produce and disseminate information that affects public opinion and can alter
  the conduct and perceived legitimacy of military operations.
  E-16. ISR, IM, psychological operations, and information operations provide a common framework for
  determining how to plan, task, and control assets; how and where to report information; and how to use
  information.




  28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                               E-3
Appendix E



      E-17. Technology is a core capability that enables comprehensive situational understanding of CBRN
      threats and hazards and generates a strategic-to-tactical infosphere (a collection of interfaces, software
      tools, data, appliances, servers, and collaborators). Technology enhances leader, unit, and Service member
      ability to manage information and affects how forces plan, prepare, and execute operations in peace,
      conflict, and war. It has significantly increased our ability to conduct ISR operations, and it greatly
      enhances the ability to conduct battle command through modern telecommunications and microprocessing.
      Technology and technological systems provide supporting capabilities essential to implementing and
      continuously refining the CBRN threat assessment, including voice and data communications systems, IM
      systems (record keeping, resource tracking), and data display systems. Included are specialized
      technologies that facilitate ongoing operations and CBRN C2 activities in situations that call for unique
      technology-based capabilities.
      E-18. Situational understanding is achieved by applying judgment, experience, expertise, and intuition; it
      allows the commander to understand the current state of friendly and enemy forces. Situational
      understanding includes the relationships among friendly and enemy forces and the variables of the OE that
      represent potential opportunities or threats for the warfighting unit. To maintain vertical and horizontal
      exchange of CBRN-related information, the commander and CBRN staff maintain constant SA and updates
      to the COP; therefore, intelligence assessments must be integrated among military, domestic, and foreign
      civil sources. (See table E-1 for examples of the required functional staff interfaces.)
                                   Table E-1. Functional staff interfaces
Information Environment                                           Description
                                   •    The HR officer, medical officer, and CBRN staff assess the probability
                                        and impact of CBRN-related casualties and CBRN personnel readiness
                                        issues. This is especially critical when a majority of U.S. forces are
                                        reserve component members arriving in-theater at various times and are
HR                                      spread across warfighting functions.
                                   •    The medical officer ensures that medical support is available in the event
                                        of a CBRN attack.
                                   •    The CBRN staff checks with the personnel officer to determine the
                                        impact of CBRN casualties on the unit throughout operation phases.
                                   •    The CBRN staff works with the intelligence officer on weather and terrain
                                        data. They assess whether environmental factors are conducive to
                                        enemy use of CBRN weapons.
                                   •    The intelligence section PIR address the enemy situation and the enemy
                                        ability to use CBRN weapons. The CBRN staff supports the intelligence
                                        section in the development of PIR.
Intelligence
                                   •    The CBRN staff assists in the IPOE/IPB process for operation phases—
                                        determining and/or evaluating enemy capabilities, types of agents, types
                                        of obscurants and sensors, protective posture, line-of-sight influences on
                                        direct fire, and friendly vulnerabilities to enemy strengths.
                                   •    The intelligence section provides information on enemy vulnerability to
                                        friendly operations (OBS).
                                   •    The CBRN staff recommends proper MOPP guidance, troop safety
                                        criteria, and the OEG. The staff also recommends priorities for the use of
                                        limited CBRND resources to the operations section through phases of
                                        operations.
                                   •    The CBRN staff supports the operations staff by recommending task
                                        organizations for CBRN units and coordinating OBS, decontamination,
                                        and CBRN reconnaissance efforts.

                                   •    The CBRN staff advises the commander on the impact of CBRN-related
                                        attacks on the current and future CONOPS. They provide input to the
                                        commander on hazard predictions, vulnerability, control of CBRN units,
                                        and mitigating techniques; and they recommend priorities for actions
                                        (decontamination, CBRN reconnaissance support, CDE resupply).
                                   •    The CBRN staff provides recommendations on CBRN reconnaissance,
                                        decontamination, and OBS unit employment.

                                •   The CBRN staff must coordinate with the logistics section concerning
                                    MOPP gear, decontaminants, and resupply requirements throughout
                                    phases of operations.
                                •   The logistics section and CBRN staff must know the rate and extent of
                                    the unit decontamination capability.
                                •   The logistics section and CBRN staff must plan to decontaminate
Logistics                           contaminated supplies or equipment. In addition, the CBRN staff keeps
                                    the logistics section abreast of reported CBRN contamination to MSRs,
                                    critical supply facilities, and maintenance facilities that affect unit

                                •   The CBRN staff advises the logistics section on ways to limit the need for
                                    the decontamination of supplies, which includes the use of disposable
                                    protective wraps or covers.
                                •   The CBRN staff works with the CA officer (USA, USMC, and USAF) on
                                    estimating the impact of CBRN events on the civilian population in the

                                    the correct force mixture to deliver the right weapon to defeat adversary
                                    CBRN capability with minimum collateral effects.
                                •   Prior to target nomination and selection, coordination addresses the type
                                    of enemy CBRN agents, their containment within facilities and vehicles,
                                    their proximity to population centers, and adversary active and passive
Fire support                        defenses.
                                •   The law of armed conflict and its relation to noncombatants and friendly
                                    forces provides key targeting guidance.
                                •   Target planning also requires knowledge of the types of agents,

Information Environment                                          Description
                                  •   The CBRN staff, military law enforcement officer, and FP officer
                                      coordinate and exchange needed information on CBRND, especially data
                                      on CBRN identification, detection, and warning.
Security
                                  •   Timely information exchange on CBRND is especially important for land
                                      force movement in the AO. Personnel at traffic control points should be
                                      well informed on contamination locations.
                                  •   The command surgeon advises the commander on the health effects of
                                      CBRN and TIM agents and the medical effects of immunizations,
                                      pretreatments, chemoprophylaxis, and treatment.
                                  •   Environmental sampling of the air, water, and soil must occur to provide
                                      input into the quantitative health risk assessment and the commander’s
                                      composite risk assessment.
                                  •   The HSS staff provides recommendations on associated concerns (heat
                                      stress and psychological effects of CBRN weapons use). The plans help
Medical/HSS                           to ensure that required HSS is available in the event of a CBRN attack.
                                  •   The HSS staff also oversees the PVNTMED mission, which includes the
                                      establishment of laboratories to handle CBRN sample analyses and
                                      ensures that PVNTMED services are provided to the commander.
                                  •   The HSS staff ensures casualty treatment, and PVNTMED personnel
                                      coordinate plans with CBRND personnel.
                                  •   The medical staff provides medical guidance on the establishment of
                                      radiation exposure levels.
                                  •   The public affairs portion is crucial to the success of the overall operation.
                                      We can win the battle and lose the war of public opinion.

INFRASTRUCTURE
    E-19. The infrastructure is more than just a collection of physical assets. The importance of the individual
    or collective assets is drawn from the situation and their relationship to the other PMESII/PMESII-PT
    variables. Determine the following:
              What are the potential accidental-release hazards from local activities (industrial pipelines,
               storage, and shipping facilities)?
              Does the infrastructure network operate efficiently, or is it cumbersome?
              Are there industrial chemical plants or nuclear-power facilities that may be targeted by threat
               forces?
              What is the civil response capability of hospitals, clinics, and medical treatment facilities to
               handle patients from a CBRN incident?
              Are facilities and water sources available to support decontamination operations?

PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
    E-20. JP 3-0 defines the physical environment as land, maritime, air, and space domains. Humans live,
    breathe, and walk in the physical environment; and they see, hear, and touch objects that are real. The
    physical environment includes weather, terrain, geography, and man-made structures within the operational
    area. The enemy understands the effects of CBRN agents on weather and terrain; therefore, they may try to
    counteract U.S. military advantages by using CBRN agents during favorable weather conditions to deny
    operational uses of urban or other essential terrain. Weather and terrain effects must be continuously
    assessed so that decision support tools and predictive modeling capabilities can integrate environmental
    conditions. (See table E-2 for more information on physical-environment variables.)
                              Table E-2. Physical-environment variables
 Physical Environment                                            Description
                            Detailed weather information must be obtained to determine its effects on the
                            employment of CBRN weapons and materials. Examples include, but are not
                            limited to—
                                 •    Thermometer readings to estimate the effect of temperature on agent
                                      duration.
                                 •    Data regarding wind speed and direction for hazard and OBS prediction.
Weather considerations           •    Information about atmospheric conditions (humidity, air stability) to
                                      determine their influence on the use of obscurants.
                                 •    The effect weather will have on the employment of CBRN weapons.
                                 •    Weather effects on the behavior of CBRN threats and hazards.
                                 •    Weather will be favorable or unfavorable for the use of CBRN weapons
                                      during the next 72 hours.
                            The CBRN staff identifies critical terrain that must be avoided, actively protected, or
                            exploited temporarily to accomplish the mission; fixed facilities, structures, or other
                            real property required by operations for logistics, C2, administration,
                            communications, billeting, base camp, or other mission purposes; and potential
                            enemy CBRN targets or NAIs and plan contingency responses. The analysis
                            should concentrate on characteristics that impact operations, to include—
                                 •   Capability of road, rail, air, and sea transportation networks to support the
Terrain considerations               movement of, and logistics support to, CBRN weapons.

                                 •   Operational impact of large geographic features (mountains, large forests,
                                     deserts, archipelagos).
                                 •   Impact of seasonal climate on CBRN weapon effects.
                                 •   Water supply and source.
                                 •   Soil type and land cover.

TIME
      E-21. Time is a significant consideration in military operations. The analysis of time as an operational
      variable focuses on the benefits and liabilities of the duration of operations to each side. CBRN threats and
      hazards have implications at every level of planning. Some enemies view protracted conflict as
      advantageous to them. They may focus on surviving and inflicting friendly and civilian CBRN casualties
      over time. This creates opportunities to affect the way that the CBRN weapon usage is viewed by domestic

  and international audiences. Essentially, today’s enemies wage conflict in the information environment as
  much as, or more than, the physical domains.

MISSION, ENEMY, TERRAIN AND WEATHER, TROOPS AND
SUPPORT AVAILABLE, TIME AVAILABLE, AND CIVIL
CONSIDERATIONS VARIABLES
  E-22. Upon receipt of a warning order or mission, leaders narrow their focus to METT-TC/METT-T
  variables. These variables describe the relevant information for a given mission and form the framework
  for mission analysis. Relevant information is all information of importance to commanders and staffs in the
  exercise of C2. (See FM 3-0 for more information.) Leaders use METT-TC/METT-T to synthesize
  operational- and tactical-level information with local knowledge relevant to their mission.

        Note. The USMC uses the acronym METT-T. Civilian considerations are inherently measured
        within the context of this acronym.


MISSION
  E-23. The nature of the tactical mission may imply specific CBRN threats and hazards. Some missions are
  inherently more dangerous than others. Leaders look for hazards associated with the complexity of higher
  headquarters plans and orders (a particularly complex scheme of maneuver). The use of a fragmentary
  order in lieu of a detailed operation order or operation plan also may raise the risk due to the possibility of
  misunderstanding.

ENEMY
  E-24. The AO is influenced by the physical location of adversary land, air, naval, space, and other forces
  that could pose a direct threat to the security of the friendly force or the success of its mission. It is
  important that enemy unit type, composition, disposition, capabilities, and intent are well understood.
  Commanders look for enemy presence or CBRN capabilities that pose hazards to the operation or mission.

TERRAIN AND WEATHER
  E-25. The factors of observation and fields of fire, avenues of approach, key and decisive terrain, obstacles,
  and cover and concealment are used to identify and assess the CBRN threats and hazards impacting
  mission-type operations. Terrain should always be addressed when planning a tactical mission, and leaders
  should also assess weather conditions for mission and nonmission activities:
            Terrain. Common terrain factors are elevation, altitude, road surfaces, curves, grades, and
             traffic density.
            Weather. Common weather factors are cold, ice, snow, rain, fog, heat, humidity, wind, dust,
             visibility, and illumination.

        Note. See Potential Military Chemical/Biological Agents and Compounds for additional
        information on the effects of terrain and weather on the dispersion of CBRN agents and
        materials.


TROOPS AND SUPPORT AVAILABLE
  E-26. Troops and support considerations CBRN threats and hazards that are associated with the level of
  training, staffing, equipment, and equipment maintenance and condition. They also include morale,
  availability of supplies and services, and the physical and emotional health of the warfighter.
  E-27. U.S. forces should deploy with CBRND equipment in the unit load. Personnel should carry the
  overgarments in their CBRN bag or wear the overgarments. This will depend on the CBRN threat to the
  airfield or port on which they land. Personnel should change protective mask filters before deployment.
  Decontamination and CBRN reconnaissance assets should be task-organized and moved forward.


  28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                               E-9
Appendix E



   Contingency stocks of CBRND equipment, including medical countermeasures, may be moved forward to
   the battalion trains. Chemical downwind messages/effective downwind messages are initiated, and
   collective-protection systems are placed into a state of readiness, including those systems in combat
   vehicles.
   E-28. U.S. forces may not have to carry CBRND equipment (individual protective equipment) based on the
   initial threat estimate. If the threat conditions were to change and indicators were present to suggest the
   possible use of CBRN agents by threat forces, CBRND equipment would be deployed forward (division,
   brigade support area). These stocks may be prepalletized for immediate deployment by aircraft to the
   affected unit, if required. However, this decision must be made based on available aircraft or other
   transportation systems. This could be done so that the forces would not have to carry the MOPP ensemble
   in their field packs or CBRN bags.

TIME AVAILABLE
   E-29. Insufficient time for mission preparation often forces commanders to accept greater risk in the
   planning, preparation, and execution of plans and orders associated with mission planning. To avoid or
   mitigate the risk associated with inadequate time for planning, leaders should allow subordinates two-thirds
   of the available planning time as a control. For nonmission activities, insufficient time is usually due to
   haste rather than availability.

CIVIL CONSIDERATIONS
   E-30. This function expands the consideration of CBRN threats and hazards to include those hazards that a
   tactical mission may pose to the civilian population and noncombatants in the AO. The objective is to
   reduce the amount of collateral damage to civilians and noncombatants. CBRN hazards are also created by
   the presence of a large civilian population and their efforts to conduct day-to-day activities during the
   course of a mission. High civilian traffic densities may present hazards to convoys and maneuver
   schemes. Such diverse elements as insurgencies, riots, and criminal activity must also be assessed.
   E-31. For nonmission activities, the term “legal” is used to address those legal, regulatory, or policy
   considerations that may impact a desired activity or limit a leader’s or an individual’s COA.

WEATHER AND TERRAIN EFFECTS ON CHEMICAL,
BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR THREATS AND
HAZARDS
   E-32. Weather and terrain can affect CBRN hazards in various ways. They may prolong the agent’s
   presence in the AO or shorten the time that agents pose a hazard to the warfighter. By knowing how
   weather and terrain affect CBRN weapons, threats, and hazards, commanders, leaders, and staffs can plan
   CBRN vulnerability reduction measures. (See Potential Military Chemical/Biological Agents and
   Compounds for detailed information and technical data on CB agents and other compounds of military
   interest, including their uses; classification; and physical, chemical, and physiological properties.)

CHEMICAL HAZARDS
   E-33. Adversaries will seek to employ chemical agents under favorable weather conditions, if possible, to
   increase their effectiveness. Considerations of weather effects also influence commander’s decisions and
   the CBRN staff recommendations for threat conditions. (See table E-3 for weather effects on aerosol

E-34. The following are weather effects on chemical hazards:
         Atmospheric stability. One of the key factors in using chemical weapons is the determination
          of the atmospheric stability condition that will exist at the time of attack. This determination can
          be made from a meteorological report or by observing field conditions as follows:
              Unstable conditions. Unstable conditions (many rising and falling air currents, great
               turbulence) quickly disperse chemical agents. Unstable is the least favorable condition for
               chemical agent use because it results in a lower concentration, thereby reducing the area
               affected by the agent. Many more munitions are required to attain the commander’s
               objectives under unstable conditions than under stable or neutral conditions.
              Stable conditions. Stable conditions (low wind speeds, slight turbulence) produce the
               highest concentrations. Chemical agents remain near the ground and may travel for long
               distances before being dissipated. Stable conditions encourage the agent cloud to remain
               intact, thus allowing it to cover extremely large areas without diffusion. However, the
               direction and extent of cloud travel under stable conditions are not predictable if dependable
               local wind data is not available. A very stable condition is the most favorable condition for
               achieving a high concentration from a chemical cloud being dispersed.
              Neutral conditions. Neutral conditions are moderately favorable. With low wind speed and
               smooth terrain, large areas may be effectively covered. The neutral condition occurs at dawn
               and sunset and, generally, is the most predictable. For this reason, a neutral dispersion
               category is often best from a military standpoint.
         Vapor concentration and diffusion. Agent concentration is governed by the volume of the
          agent cloud. Since clouds continually expand, agent concentration levels decrease over time.
          Wind speed determines the downwind growth of the cloud. Vertical and horizontal turbulence
          determines the height and width of the cloud. The rate at which the downwind, vertical, and
          horizontal components expand governs the cloud volume and the agent concentration. To be
          effective at a specific concentration level, the agent cloud must remain in the target area for a
          definite period. Wind in the target area mixes the agent and distributes it over the target after
          release. For ground targets, high concentrations and good coverage can best be achieved with
          low turbulence and calm winds when the agent is delivered directly on target. A steady,
          predictable wind drift over the target is best when the agent is delivered on the upwind side of
          the target. Conditions other than these tend to produce lower concentrations and poorer target
          coverage. However, unless the weather conditions are known within the target area, the effects
          of the agent on the target will be approximations. The concentration and diffusion of a chemical-
          agent cloud are also influenced by the following:
              Hydrolysis. Hydrolysis is a process in which (chemical) compounds decompose and split
               into other compounds by taking up the elements of water. Chemical agents with high
               hydrolysis rates are less effective under high-humidity conditions.
              Absorption and adsorption. Absorption is the process by which an agent is taken into the
               vegetation, skin, soil, or material. Adsorption is adding a thin layer of agent to vegetation or
               other surfaces. This is important in dense vegetation. Absorption and adsorption of chemical
               agents may kill vegetation, thus defoliating the area of employment.
              Meandering. When a chemical cloud is released into the air, shifting air currents and
               horizontal turbulence blow it from side to side. The side-to-side motion of the air is called
               meandering. While the agent cloud meanders, it also spreads laterally. Lateral spreading is
               called lateral diffusion. In more unstable conditions, the lateral spread tends to be greater
               than in stable conditions.
              Drag. Wind currents carry chemical clouds along the ground with a rolling motion. This is
               caused by the differences in wind velocity. Wind speeds increase rapidly from near zero at
               the ground to higher speeds at higher elevations above the ground. The drag effect by the
               ground, together with the interference of vegetation and other ground objects, causes the
               base of an agent cloud to be impeded as the cloud stretches out in length. When clouds are
               released on the ground, the drag amounts to about ten percent of the vertical growth over
               distance traveled over grass, plowed land, or water. It amounts to about 20 percent over




28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                              E-11
Appendix E



                   gently rolling terrain covered with bushes, growing crops, or small patches of scattered
                   timber. In heavy woods, the drag effect is greatly increased.
                  Wind shear. Wind speeds can vary at different heights. The wind direction can also change
                   with an increase in height; this is known as wind shear. Because of wind shear, a puff (or
                   chemical cloud) may become stretched in the downwind direction and may travel in a
                   direction different from that of the surface wind. Additionally, a chemical cloud released in
                   the air may be carried along faster than it can diffuse downward. As a result, air near the
                   ground on the forward edge of the cloud may be uncontaminated, while the air a few feet up
                   may be heavily contaminated. This layering effect becomes more pronounced and increases
                   proportionately with the distance of the forward edge of the cloud from the source.
                  Density. Density is the mass found in a volume of gas, liquid, or solid. Since atoms and
                   molecules weigh something (have mass), the more of them packed into a given space, the
                   greater the density. The vertical rise of a chemical cloud depends on the weather variables
                   (temperature gradient, wind speed, turbulence) and the difference between the densities of
                   the clouds and the surrounding air. As mentioned earlier, the temperature of the cloud and
                   the air influences their relative densities. Hotter gases are less dense and lighter than cooler
                   gases and air. Therefore, they rise until they are mixed and somewhat diluted and attain the
                   same temperature and approximately the same density as the surrounding air. The vapor
                   cloud formed by an agent normally employed for a persistent effect rises in a similar
                   manner, but vapor concentrations build up more gradually.
             Wind. High wind speeds cause a rapid dispersion of vapors or aerosols, thereby decreasing the
              effective coverage of the target area and time of exposure to the agent. In high winds, larger
              quantities of munitions are required to ensure effective concentrations. Agent clouds are most
              effective when wind speeds are less than 4 knots and steady in direction. The clouds move with
              the prevailing wind as altered by terrain and vegetation. Steady, low wind (speeds of three to
              seven knots) enhances the coverage area unless an unstable condition exists. With high winds,
              chemical agents cannot be economically employed to achieve casualties. The evaporation of
              liquid agents due to wind speed depends on the amount of the liquid exposed to the wind (the
              surface of the liquid) and the rate that the air passes over the agent. Therefore, the duration of
              effectiveness is longer at places of greater liquid agent contamination and in places where the
              liquid agent is sheltered from the wind. The rate of evaporation of agents employed for persistent
              effect in a liquid state is proportional to the wind speed. If the speed increases, evaporation
              increases, thus shortening the duration of the effective contamination. Increased evaporation
              creates a larger vapor cloud. The vapor cloud is dispersed by higher winds.
             Temperature. Vaporization increases with higher temperatures. Also, the rate of evaporation of
              remaining liquid agent from an exploding munition can vary with the temperature.
             Humidity. Humidity has little effect on most chemical-agent clouds. Some agents (phosgene
              and lewisite) hydrolyze quite readily. Hydrolysis causes these chemical agents to break down
              and change their chemical characteristics. High humidity combined with high temperatures may
              increase the effectiveness of some agents due to body perspiration-absorbing agents and allow
              for better transfer.
             Precipitation. Precipitation can dilute and disperse chemical hazards, but can spread
              contamination.

BIOLOGICAL HAZARDS
   E-35. The following are weather effects on biological hazards:
            Air stability. The effects of temperature gradients on biological agents are similar to those on
             chemical agents. However, temperature gradients have less effect on a biological-agent cloud
             than a chemical-agent cloud because biological agents are effective in lower concentrations than
             chemical agents. A stable atmosphere (inversion) produces the greatest effects. Under unstable
             (lapse) and neutral conditions, greater atmospheric mixing reduces cloud concentration, but
             concentration is still sufficient to inflict casualties. Predictions of these effects require specific
             knowledge of the agent and its potential carriers. (See table E-4 for information on how weather
             affects biological-agent dissemination [see JP 3-11].)

        Temperature. Air temperature in the surface boundary layer is related to the amount of sunlight
         that the ground has received. Normal atmospheric temperatures have little direct effect on the
         microorganisms of a biological aerosol. Indirectly, however, an increase in the evaporation rate
         of the aerosol droplets normally follows a temperature increase. There is evidence that the
         survival of most pathogens decreases sharply in the range of -20°C to -40°C and above 49°C.
         High temperatures kill most bacteria, viral, and rickettsial agents. However, these temperatures
         will seldom be encountered under natural conditions. Subfreezing temperatures tend to quick-
         freeze the aerosol after its release, thus decreasing the rate of decay. Ultraviolet light (one form
         of the radiation from the sun) has a destructive effect on the biological aerosol because exposure
         to ultraviolet light increases the decay rate of microorganisms. Most toxins are more stable than
         pathogens and less susceptible to the influence of temperature.
        Relative humidity. The relative humidity level favoring the employment of a biological-agent
         aerosol depends on whether the aerosol is distributed wet or dry. For a wet aerosol, a high
         relative humidity retards the evaporation of tiny droplets containing microorganisms. This
         decreases the decay rate of wet agents, as drying results in the death of these microorganisms. A
         low relative humidity is favorable for the employment of dry agents. When the humidity is high,
         the additional moisture in the air may increase the decay rate of the microorganisms of dry
         aerosol. This is because moisture speeds up the life cycle of the microorganisms. Most toxins are
         more stable than pathogens and are less susceptible to the influence of relative humidity.
        Pollutants. Atmospheric pollutant gases have been found to decrease the survival of many
         pathogens. These gases include nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide.
         This could be a significant factor on an AO over which the air is often polluted.
        Cloud coverage. Cloud coverage in an area influences the amount of solar radiation received by
         the aerosol because clouds decrease the amount of destructive ultraviolet light that the
         microorganisms receive. Cloud coverage also influences other factors (ground temperature,
         relative humidity).
        Precipitation. Precipitation may wash suspended particles from the air. This washout may be
         significant in a heavy rainstorm, but minimal at other times. High relative humidity associated
         with mist, drizzle, or very light rain is also an important factor. This may be favorable or
         unfavorable, depending on the type of agent. The low temperatures associated with ice, snow,
         and other winter precipitation prolongs the life of most biological agents.
        Sunlight. Most biological pathogens and some toxins are affected by ultraviolet rays in sunlight.
         Therefore, most attacks will likely occur at night, during extended twilight, or during overcast
         conditions. Pathogens may be encapsulated (enclosed in a natural or man-made protective
         covering) or genetically engineered to increase resistance to direct sunlight. Thus, agents
         delivered during conditions of direct sunlight or after morning nautical twilight should be a
         sunlight-resistant agent.

Appendix E



             Wind. High wind speeds increase the area covered by biological agents, but they also dilute the
              agent, thereby lowering the casualty percentages within an area. Most biological warfare attacks
              occur under conditions of moderate wind speed because the most effective wind speeds for
              target coverage are 12 to 30 kilometers per hour. As the agent cloud travels downwind, it
              gradually loses its effectiveness due to dilution caused by agent fallout, dispersal, and death of
              the pathogen agent or neutralization of the toxin. However, the downwind hazard areas of
              biological weapons will be much larger than those of chemical weapons because most biological
              agents are lighter and more potent (weight-to-effect basis) than chemical agents. If delivered
              directly on target, as with a bomblet attack, the wind direction and speed will have a more
              limited effect on coverage; however, downwind effects must still be considered. If dissemination
              occurs far upwind from the target area in a more elevated manner, downwind effects can be even
              more dramatic.

RADIOLOGICAL AND NUCLEAR HAZARDS
   E-36. Conditions that significantly affect the visibility or the transparency of the air also affect the
   transmission of thermal radiation. Clouds, obscuration (including artificial), fog, snow, and rain absorb and
   scatter thermal energy. Depending on the concentration, they can stop as much as 90 percent of the thermal
   energy. On the other hand, clouds above the burst may reflect additional thermal radiation onto the target
   that would have otherwise traveled harmlessly into the sky. The following are effects on radiological and
   nuclear hazards:
              Precipitation. Rain on an area contaminated by a surface burst changes the pattern of
               radioactive intensities by washing off higher elevations, buildings, equipment, and vegetation.
               This reduces intensities in some areas and possibly increases intensities in drainage systems, on
               low ground, and in flat or poorly drained areas. Rain and fog may lessen the blast wave because
               energy dissipates as it heats and evaporates the moisture in the atmosphere. Clouds and air
               density have no significant effects on fallout patterns. Precipitation scavenging, known as
               rainout, can cause the removal of radioactive particles from the atmosphere. Because of the
               uncertainties associated with weather predictions, the locations that could be affected by rainout
               cannot be accurately predicted. Rainout may occur near ground zero, or the contaminants could
               be carried aloft for tens of kilometers before deposition. Rainout is most likely to occur from a
               surface or subsurface burst. Vast quantities of radioactive debris will be carried aloft and
               deposited downwind. However, rainout may cause the fallout area to increase or decrease and
               also cause hot spots within the fallout area. For airbursts, rainout can increase the residual
               contamination hazard. Normally, the only residual hazard from an airburst is a small neutron-
               induced contamination area around ground zero. However, rainout will cause additional
               contaminated areas in unexpected locations. Yields of 10 kilotons or less present the greatest
               potential for rainout, and yields of 60 kilotons or more offer the least. Yields between 10 and 60
               kilotons may produce rainout if the nuclear clouds remain at or below rain cloud height.
              Wind speed and direction. Wind speed and direction at various altitudes are two factors that
               determine the shape, size, location, and intensities of the fallout pattern on the ground, because
               contaminated dirt and debris deposit downwind. Surface winds also play an important role in the
               final location of the fallout particles. Local winds cause localization of fallout material in
               crevices and ditches and against curbs and ledges in the same manner that snow piles up in
               drifts. This effect is not locally predictable, but personnel must be aware of the probability that
               highly intense accumulations of radioactive material will occur at their natural locations.

                                                                                     Operational Environment



COLD-WEATHER EFFECTS ON CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
HAZARDS
  E-37. Cold-weather environments create diverse conditions that must be overcome to accomplish an
  assigned mission in a CBRN environment. The following paragraphs describe cold-weather effects on
  chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards:
           Chemical. In arctic conditions, chemical agents act differently, but they are primarily more
            persistent. Chemical agents include—
                Blister agents. Some forms of blister agents are ineffective casualty producers when the
                 ambient temperature is well below their normal freezing points. This is not true for all
                 blister agents, some of which can be effective as harassing or casualty-producing agents.
                Nerve agents. Low levels of contamination may remain at low temperatures for hours or
                 days. In severely cold conditions, nerve agents will remain liquid and can be absorbed
                 through normal, cold-weather clothing. However, agent data indicates that liquid absorption
                 into soil and concrete is not significantly affected by temperature and that snow absorbs
                 agents within minutes—to the point that less than 2 percent of the agent remained as a
                 pickup/transfer hazard.
                Blood and choking agents. Blood and choking agents remain extremely hazardous and
                 nonpersistent throughout the low-temperature ranges.
           Biological. Biological warfare in the arctic is a possibility, and biological agents are effective in
            cold-weather environments (with few exceptions). However, most vectors (infected insects) will
            not survive the extreme environmental conditions, and it is more difficult to aerosolize live
            biological agents in freezing temperatures. Toxins, on the other hand, are less susceptible to the
            cold. At these temperatures, spore-forming bacteria and certain viruses survive and remain
            dormant. Upon warming, they become an active hazard to personnel. Temperature inversions
            that exist over snowfields tend to prolong the integrity of an aerosolized biological cloud. It
            disperses more slowly and remains a threat for a longer period.
           Radiological and nuclear. The winter environment influences the effects of a nuclear
            detonation regarding blast, thermal, and radiation effects as follows:
                Blast. At subzero temperatures, the radius of damage to material targets can increase as
                 much as 20 percent. Tundra, irregular terrain features, and broken ice caps will break up the
                 pressure wave and reduce the effects of this powerful wave. Blast waves can drastically
                 interfere with movement by breaking up ice covers and causing thaws, which can trigger
                 avalanches in mountainous areas. Avoid avalanche-prone areas after the blast. Avalanches
                 can be triggered up to 30 kilometers away and may cause massive flooding in valleys due to
                 the instability caused by the blast effects.
                Thermal. Ice and snow have a high reflectivity. This may increase the minimum safe
                 distance as much as 50 percent for unwarned personnel. This reflectivity may increase the
                 number of personnel whose vision is affected by the brilliant flash or light dazzle, especially
                 at night. Cold temperatures reduce thermal effects on materials by reducing the possible
                 heat signature. Snow, ice, and frost coverings on combustible materials greatly reduce the
                 tendency of materials to catch fire. However, this thermal effect will dry out exposed tundra
                 areas and grass fires may result. Again, avoid avalanche-prone areas after the blast.
                 Avalanches can be triggered up to 30 kilometers away due to the rapid warming and
                 instability caused by the thermal effects.
                Radiation. The number of passable roadways is limited by cold-weather conditions, and
                 radiological contamination on roadways may further restrict resupply and mobility.
                 Seasonal high winds in the arctic may present problems when predicting radiological
                 contamination and crossing contaminated areas. These winds may reduce dose rates at
                 ground zero. At the same time, they extend the area coverage and create a problem for
                 survey and monitoring teams. Hot spots or areas of concentrated accumulation of
                 radiological contamination may also occur in the areas of heavy snow and snow drifts.

DESERT EFFECTS ON CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR HAZARDS
   E-38. Desert daytime temperatures can vary from 90° to 125°F (32° to 52°C), creating an unstable
   temperature gradient that is not particularly favorable to CBRN attacks. However, with nightfall, the desert
   cools rapidly, resulting in a stable temperature gradient that increases the possibility of night or early
   morning attacks. Planners should understand that hot temperatures can adversely impact CBRND
   equipment/supplies during transit or storage. The following paragraphs describe desert effects on CBRN
   hazards:
            Chemical. Chemical agents can be used in point or on-target attacks. Chemical-agent attacks
             can be used at high temperatures because of rapid agent evaporation. For example, with a neutral
             temperature gradient (90°F [32°C]) and light wind, sarin evaporates rapidly. Desert soil may be
             very porous. If an attack with an unthickened liquid agent occurs in support of a predawn
             conventional attack, soil may absorb the agent. However, when the sun rises and begins to heat
             the surface, the agent may evaporate and create a vapor hazard. A nonpersistent agent attack is
             unlikely during daylight hours because weather conditions may rapidly dissipate agents. Night
             brings about a reversal of weather conditions and creates ideal conditions for an attack. At night,
             agents linger and settle into low areas (fighting positions).
            Biological. Most aerosolized, live biological agents are ineffective weapons in the high
             temperatures of desert areas. An exception is spore-forming biological agents. This is a result of
             low humidity and the ultraviolet radiation of direct sunlight. Personnel crossing or occupying
             desert terrain face little danger from long-term, live biological contamination except for spore-
             forming agents. However, a covert aerosolized attack could occur during more favorable night
             conditions. Toxins are resistant to this harsh environment and could be employed in the same
             way as chemical agents.
            Radiological and nuclear. Nuclear defense planning is much the same in a desert as in other
             areas. The lack of vegetation and permanent fixtures (forests, buildings) make it necessary to
             consider the construction of fortifications. Construction may be difficult because of sand
             inconsistencies, but sand, in combination with sandbags, will give additional protection from
             radiation exposure. Blowing winds and sand make widespread radiological survey patterns
             likely.

JUNGLE EFFECTS ON CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR HAZARDS
   E-39. Tropical climates require the highest degree of individual discipline and conditioning to maintain
   effective CBRND readiness. Dominating climatic features of jungle areas are constant high temperatures,
   heavy rainfall, and very high humidity. There is usually little or no wind in a thick jungle, and the canopy
   blocks much of the sunlight from the ground. Commanders must expect and plan for a rapid decrease in
   unit efficiency and an increase in heat casualties. In addition, they must ensure that special precautions are
   taken to maintain unit CBRN defensive equipment in usable condition and avoid the rapid effects of
   mildew, dry rot, and rust that is inherent in jungle areas. The following paragraphs describe jungle effects
   on CBRN hazards:
              Chemical. Chemical agents used in jungle areas can cause extreme problems for friendly forces.
               Persistent agents delivered by artillery shells and aircraft bombs may penetrate the canopy
               before dissemination. These agents can remain effective on jungle floors for extremely long
               periods. High temperatures can increase vapor hazards from liquid agents. Nonpersistent agent
               vapors hang suspended in the air for extended periods because of low wind speeds. However,
               these wind speeds minimize downwind vapor hazards. Chemical agents employed in jungle
               areas make MOPP gear necessary for ground operations, and high temperatures and humidity
               combined with the heat-loading characteristics of MOPP gear degrade performance.
              Biological. Jungles provide excellent conditions for threat use of live biological agents. Warm
               temperatures, high humidity, and protection from sunlight increase the survivability of disease-
               causing microorganisms. Low wind speeds and jungle growth limit downwind hazards. Strict
               adherence to field sanitation procedures (especially vector and rodent control), the use of skin
               and clothing repellents, and the use of permethrin-treated bed nets are essential in jungles. These
               procedures will help control the naturally occurring diseases that abound. Personnel should don



E-16                    ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                  28 February 2011
                                                                                    Operational Environment



            masks and roll down sleeves to cover exposed skin and prevent possible contact with live
            biological agents.
           Radiological and nuclear. Dense vegetation has little influence on the initial effects of nuclear
            detonations, except that the heavy canopy provides some protection against thermal radiation.
            The blast wave creates extensive tree blowdown and missile effects. Some falling particles are
            retained by the jungle canopy, and reduced radiation hazards may result. However, subsequent
            rains will wash these particles to the ground. Particles will concentrate in water collection areas
            and produce radiation hot spots.

MOUNTAIN EFFECTS ON CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
HAZARDS
  E-40. Mountainous areas require a high degree of CBRND preparedness. Rugged terrain limits the
  employment of large forces. Adjacent units may not be able to provide mutual support. Also, there may be
  reduced logistical support and difficulty in achieving rapid maneuver. In these circumstances, small U.S.
  units can impede, harass, or canalize numerically superior threat forces. The intention is to dissipate threat
  strength and compel threat forces to fight a decisive battle under unfavorable circumstances. Mountain
  warfare requires friendly units to be almost completely self-sufficient in CBRN protection. The following
  paragraphs describe mountain effects on CBRN hazards:
            Chemical. Aerial delivery is a likely means of chemical munitions employment in mountain
             warfare. Personnel should be constantly alert for aerial strikes, and they should take protective
             actions immediately. Defense against chemical attacks in mountains is similar to that in flat
             terrain; however, the compartmentalization and micrometeorological effects in mountainous
             terrain will affect the cloud’s downwind travel. For example, the wind could be blowing in
             different directions in adjacent valleys. Consequently, a chemical strike in one valley may not
             affect units in an adjoining valley.
            Biological. Defense against biological agents does not differ in principle in mountains from that
             in flat terrain.
            Radiological and nuclear. Nuclear targeting is easier in mountainous areas than in flat terrain
             because there are fewer roads and trails and personnel must move at slower speeds. Preparing
             fighting positions and building other protective shelters are difficult in rocky or frozen ground.
             Improvised shelters built of snow, ice, or rocks may be the only possible protection. Because of
             rapidly changing wind patterns, radiological contamination deposits may be very erratic. Hot
             spots may occur far from the point of detonation, and low intensity areas may occur very near it.
             Limited mobility makes radiological surveys on the ground difficult, and the difficulty of
             maintaining a constant flight altitude makes air surveys highly inaccurate. Natural shelters
             (caves, ravines, cliffs) provide some protection from nuclear effects and radiological
             contamination. Clear mountain air extends the range of casualty-producing thermal effects.
             Added clothing required by cool mountain temperatures, however, reduces casualties from these
             effects. Units operating under nuclear-warfare conditions should also carefully select positions
             where they will not be hit or trapped by avalanches or rock/mud slides.

URBAN-AREA EFFECTS ON CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
HAZARDS
  E-41. To plan CBRND, commanders must understand how urban terrain will affect their mission in a
  CBRN environment. For example, TIM density will likely increase in an urban area, the downwind
  transport of aerosols will be influenced by the unique micrometeorological considerations in urban terrain
  (increased thermal buildup, thermal islands), and there will be a larger number of noncombatants. The
  following paragraphs describe urban-area effects on CBRN hazards:
            Chemical. Urban structures can protect against spray attacks, but this exchange for overhead
             cover creates other problems. Generally, chemical agents tend to find and stay in low areas
             found in urban locations (basements, sewers, subway tunnels). Personnel should avoid these low
             areas. Once an attack occurs, the detection of chemical contamination becomes very important.
             Personnel must thoroughly check areas before attempting to occupy or traverse them.



  28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                             E-17
Appendix E



              Conversely, chemical-agent concentrations will generally decrease with an increase in structure
              height, and personnel on the higher stories of a tall building should experience lower agent
              concentrations.
             Biological. Buildings and other urban structures can provide some immediate protection from
              direct spray. However, the stable environment of these structures may increase the persistency of
              biological agents. Toxins are very effective in an urban environment, and personnel should take
              the same precautions prescribed for chemical agents. Pound for pound, biological agents are
              more toxic than chemical agents; and agent effects are especially magnified in an enclosed area.
              Covert operations are particularly well suited for urban terrain. Existing water and food supplies
              are prime targets. Personal hygiene becomes increasingly important. Urban terrain increases the
              potential for person-to-person transmission of contagious biological agents. Commanders must
              establish and consistently enforce sanitary and personal-hygiene measures, including
              immunizations. They must also ensure that personnel drink safe water and must never assume
              that hydrant water is safe.
             Radiological and nuclear. Without additional preparation, unreinforced buildings do not
              provide adequate shelter from a nuclear blast. If used correctly, ground floors and basements of
              steel or reinforced concrete offer excellent protection from most effects, except overpressure.
              Personnel should avoid windows due to possible injuries from flying debris and glass. Personnel
              also may receive severe burns through openings facing ground zero. Storm drains and subway
              tunnels are readily available in most urban areas. These provide better protection than ground
              level buildings. Personnel should not use structures of wood or other flammable materials
              because they could burst into flames. Buildings do provide a measure of protection against
              radiological contamination; and personnel may travel through buildings, sewers, and tunnels.
              However, they should consider the dangers of collapse in the event of a blast.

LITTORAL EFFECTS ON CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
HAZARDS
   E-42. During operations at the sea-land interface, multiple considerations impact CBRND operations. For
   example, land and sea breezes occur almost daily in tropical and mid-latitude regions on the coasts of
   islands and continents. This occurs because the land cools and heats more rapidly than the adjacent water.
   Therefore, the commander must be concerned about potential offshore CBRN agent threats and hazards.
   The following paragraphs describe littoral environmental effects on CBRN hazards:
             Chemical. Blister agents (especially mustards) may cause casualty-producing effects if
              personnel encounter them in salt or fresh water. Generally, water will cause some blister agents
              to hydrolyze; however, the temperature and relative acidity or basal content of the water will
              affect the rate of hydrolysis. Further, littoral operations in tropical areas (high temperatures, high
              humidity) can also enhance the casualty-producing effects of chemical agents.
             Biological. During littoral operations, meteorological conditions can be especially favorable for
              the use of biological agents. The offshore line release of a biological agent can cover larger
              areas. Biological-agent surveillance assets monitor for the presence of biological agents in the
              littoral environment. Even if the littoral environment is in an extreme temperate (cold or hot)
              climatic zone, a biological-agent aerosol can cause casualty-producing effects.
             Radiological and nuclear. The blast effects from a nuclear detonation can cause significant
              damage to military operations ashore and afloat, and ships could be damaged by tidal surges in
              such an attack. Reflective surfaces (water) can also enhance weapon thermal effects. Residual
              contamination can contaminate and hinder critical logistics over-the-shore operations.

Automated Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear
           Information Management Systems
       This appendix identifies the programs of record and emerging capabilities managed
       by the JPM-IS under JPEO-CBD.

INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
   F-1. A number of IM systems with core capabilities for integrated early warning, battlespace
   management, battlespace analysis, modeling and simulation, and medical surveillance are currently under
   development or have been fielded for testing by the JPEO-CBD/JPM-IS, including JWARN, JEM, and
   Joint Operational Effects Federation (JOEF).

JOINT WARNING AND REPORTING SYSTEM
   F-2. The JWARN primarily provides an integrated early warning capability, an IM system, and a
   capability to analyze the OE. It provides the capability to query and disseminate critical, time-sensitive
   CBRN defense information throughout the OE to enhance overall FP. There are five primary mission-
   essential functions performed by JWARN: SA, warning, reporting, hazard prediction; and “basic” battle
   management analysis. The JWARN implements these functionalities to provide an enhanced CBRN
   defense capability for the warfighter.

JOINT EFFECTS MODEL
   F-3. The JEM provides a single, DOD-approved methodology and model that provides common
   representation of CBRN hazard areas and effects resulting from CBRN weapons and TIM. Operationally,
   JEM supports operational and crisis action planning to mitigate the effects of WMD, to include weapons
   with CBRN payloads and accidental TIM releases.
   F-4. Additionally, JEM assists DOD components and allied or coalition forces by providing CBRN and
   TIM hazard predictions and effects to the warfighter during and after an incident. Analytically, JEM assists
   DOD components and allied or coalition forces to train jointly develop doctrine and tactics; and assess
   warfighting, technology, materiel development proposals, and force structure.
   F-5. The JEM is interoperable with selected command, control, communications, computers, and
   intelligence (C4I) systems. Software applications on those C4I systems (JWARN) use JEM to provide an
   enhanced prediction of hazard areas to provide detailed warning to U.S. forces within those areas.
   Operational effects systems on those C4I systems (JOEF) uses JEM to predict hazard areas. JEM may also
   be operated as a stand-alone application that is not interfaced or networked with a C4I system.

JOINT OPERATIONAL EFFECTS FEDERATION
   F-6. The JOEF provides automated decision support tools that enable the joint force commander to more
   effectively and efficiently assess risk and allocate scarce resources in preparation for and during operations
   involving CBRN and TIM hazards.
   F-7. The JOEF supports the assessment of military operations with CBRN-related risk levels and the
   preparation for the employment of CBRN defenses and resources. It JOEF provides deliberate (long-term)
   planning and analytical products to support the commander’s evaluation of CBRN impacts and operational
   planning. As operations move into the crisis action phase, JOEF provides products allowing the
   commander to plan for likely CBRN and TIM hazards and then assess and respond to actual hazards and
   impacts on warfighting missions.


28 February 2011        ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                                F-1
Appendix F



      F-8. As an analytical tool, JOEF assists the commander in the warfighting-mission decision process and is
      employed at operational commands and in CBRN command centers for the assessment of operational risk
      levels and allocation of resource needs. These tools assist operations planners in assessing and mitigating
      CBRN and TIM hazard operational degradation and vulnerabilities. The tools incorporate the interrelated
      effects of mission requirements, CBRN hazards, logistical concerns, medical implications and support
      needs (casualty estimation, troop exposures, casualty care, treatment) and the deployment of CBRN
      defense resources. The use of JOEF as an analytical tool allows the commander to conduct a
      comprehensive visualization of the joint battlespace in the CBRN environment.

JOINT WARNING AND REPORTING NETWORK CONCEPT OF
OPERATIONS
      F-9. The JWARN resides in C2 centers at the echelon levels defined by the Services. It transfers data
      from existing sensors and to and from future sensors; provide alerts for potential CBRN risks to
      commanders, units, and C2 systems; activate alarms for personnel at risk; and send warning (dewarning)
      reports to affected units throughout the OE. Service-specific CONOPS for JWARN are described below.

U.S. ARMY
      F-10. The JWARN is located in C2 centers at the appropriate echelon and employed by CBRN defense
      specialists and other designated personnel who are trained in the system. The capability is available at
      theater to platoon level echelons. The JWARN (mission application software only) interoperates with the
      C2 systems located on vehicles that carry sensors and may completely reside on these vehicles in future
      increments. It is located in areas where CBRND warning and reporting, analysis, and planning are required
      and where information is displayed on the COP. JWARN requires network or direct connectivity to receive
      timely detection information from deployed sensors and NBC reports from observers and CBRN
      reconnaissance assets.
      F-11. The JWARN relies on network connectivity to disseminate CBRN hazard warning, reports,
      contamination overlays, and related products. JWARN software is capable of interoperating or residing on
      the Services’ C2 systems of choice, which include the Maneuver Control System; Global Command and
      Control System–Army; and Force XXI Battle Command, Brigade and Below (FBCB2) (and future FBCB2
      products) in vehicles, tactical operations center, and unit command posts. JWARN is able to use, publish,
      and subscribe service and, later, use the Defense Dissemination System for sending and receiving
      information and data. Subsequent increments require that these products be developed as Net-Centric
      Enterprise Services—compliant services that would be hosted on the Battle Command Common Services
      infrastructure in support of the USA technical vision for implementing the Battle Command Migration Plan
      to transition to Net-Centric Enterprise Services.
      F-12. The JWARN is operated by personnel who are currently operating the host C2 system. At battalion
      and above, the software is operated by a CBRN officer.

U.S. MARINE CORPS
      F-13. The USMC employs JWARN mission application software only. USMC CBRN defense personnel
      assigned to CBRN centers and sections use the JWARN mission application software. The JWARN
      mission application software is used to provide the Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF) commanders
      with a comprehensive analysis and warning capability to access, assimilate, and disseminate CBRN and
      TIM information throughout the COP.
      F-14. The JWARN mission application software provides the operational capability to employ CBRN
      warning technology, which collects, analyzes, identifies, locates, reports, and disseminates CBRN threats.
      It allows the operator to predict and track the actual movement of CBRN hazard areas within a
      multidimensional battlespace.
      F-15. The JWARN mission application software may be used as a planning and training tool and is
      integrated into the Global Information Grid; Global Command and Control System–Joint, Joint Command
      and Control, Intelligence Operations System; and Intelligence Operations Workstation and interfaced via



F-2                       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1               28 February 2011
          Automated Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Information Management Systems



   Command and Control Personal Computer. MAGTF commanders can use this information operationally to
   take immediate actions necessary to protect personnel and equipment in the affected area, thus enabling
   decision superiority.

U.S. NAVY
   F-16. The USN intends to employ only the JWARN mission application software at present. The JWARN
   mission application software resides on USN C2I/command, control, communications, computers,
   intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems throughout the fleet, expeditionary, and
   shore facilities as necessary. The JWARN is operable with the USN C2I/C4ISR systems, and be compatible
   with those systems with respect to databases, maps, and shipboard displays. After requisite training, the
   USN expects JWARN to be operated by Seamen in the operations specialist, intelligence specialist, and
   aerographer’s mate ratings.

U.S. AIR FORCE
   F-17. For peacetime mission profile/deployment, JWARN is fielded to civil engineer readiness flights,
   engineer squadrons (RED HORSE), Silver Flag training sites, Civil Engineering Readiness Technical
   School, USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, civil engineering readiness positions not within a flight, and
   CBRN staff sections at combined air operations centers, numbered air forces, major commands, and Air
   Staff. JWARN is provided to units with UTCs that require a designed operational capability for deployment
   to medium- and high-threat areas. JWARN is employed in the readiness control center and/or the CBRN
   cell (primary, alternate, and tertiary) portion of the EOC at wing operational locations.
   F-18. The JWARN is maintained in an operational status with networked sensors and C2 functions at high-
   and medium-threat installations when intelligence dictates a near-term or immediate CBRN threat. CONUS
   locations may use JWARN for the modeling and prediction of TIM hazards and to respond to the use of
   WMD. Configurations of JWARN integrates CBRN sensors and provide automated operation.
   F-19. Readiness (Air Force specialty 3E9X1) and bioenvironmental (Air Force Specialty 4B0X1)
   technicians use JWARN to access and monitor the performance of CBRN sensors on the air base. Detection
   data transfers automatically or with human intervention from the actual sensors to C2 systems.
   Commanders use the analyzed data to make decisions for disseminating warnings down to the lowest level
   of the OE.
   F-20. For wartime mission profile/employment, civil engineer readiness flights, RED HORSE squads,
   bioenvironmental flights, and CBRN staff sections at combined air operations centers, numbered Air
   Forces, major commands, and headquarters, is responsible for operational employment, analysis, and
   update of CBRN hazard information. Upon the escalation of CBRN activities, operators run the JWARN
   software within the CBRN cell to analyze, plot, and report CBRN attack information up, down, and
   laterally along the military command structure. Operators also use JWARN products to support briefings to
   commanders covering CBRN warfare hazards within the immediate AOR and, to some extent, the theater.
   Contamination persistency or intensity plots provide commanders with a definitive picture to match written
   guidance contained in the current version of ATP-45.
   F-21. Each USAF installation that is subject to deployment to a high or medium CBRN threat area
   establishes/maintains a deployable UTC. The following deployable UTCs: 4F9DA, 4F9DB, 4F9E9, 4F9R2,
   4F9R5, and FFGL7 is provided to the JWARN software (current version) and to sufficient interfaces
   required to support the networking of detection sensor systems contained on the UTC. When employed at a
   fixed site with a high/medium threat, in-place and deployable assets is merged to create one CBRN
   detection grid network.

JOINT EFFECTS MODEL CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
   F-22. Operational units collect and report CBRN information to a CBRN cell. Through CBRN warning
   systems (JWARN), the CBRN cell collects and correlates this information. The JEM is used automatically
   or manually to calculate the transport and dispersion. For example, the plumes of CBRN events, taking into
   account the terrain and weather information collected from appropriate agencies. The plumes of CBRN



   28 February 2011      ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                           F-3
Appendix F



      events are formatted and processed by the warning system and broadcast to operational units’ COPs to
      provide a standardized picture of the effects of the CBRN event throughout the battlespace. When a
      network is unavailable, JEM may also be operated as a stand-alone application that is not interfaced or
      networked with a C4I system,. Service-specific CONOPS for JEM are described in the following
      paragraphs.

U.S. ARMY
      F-23. The JEM is used by CBRN officers (74A) and CBRN NCOs (74D) of the chemical staff sections at
      the battalion, brigade, division, corps, and echelons above corps levels, and Special Forces chemical
      reconnaissance detachments. Brigade, division, and corps levels also have a stand-alone version of JEM
      that is used by CBRN staff planners. The JEM operates within USA Service organizations on computer
      systems operating within local area networks and wide area networks, including Non-Secure Internet
      Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) and Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) systems.
      The JEM is operationally imbedded within the Global Command and Control System (GCCS), joint tactical
      COP workstation hosted on a Command and Control Personal Computer Air and Missile Defense Planning
      and Control System, Medium Extended Air Defense System, or Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense
      Systems and follow-on air defense artillery theater missile defense systems, unified combatant commands,
      and air defense artillery.

U.S. MARINE CORPS
      F-24. The JEM, along with other battle management systems, provide commanders with information on
      possible CBRN hazards throughout their AO.
      F-25. The primary purpose of JEM is to provide the MAGTF commander with an operational tool whose
      outputs can be used to support planning and assessment decisions to mitigate the effects of WMD, to
      include CBRN and TIM agents. JEM assists the MAGTF commander to train jointly; develop doctrine and
      tactics; and assess warfighting, technology, materiel development proposals, and force structure. A
      commander uses CBRN incident information from JEM to assist in deciding what actions are necessary to
      protect personnel and equipment from the potential damaging effects of CBRN and TIM hazards. It is also
      used to conduct planning and training by providing the MAGTF commander with a tool that is capable of
      modeling CBRN and TIM threats within an AO.
      F-26. The JEM is integrated with JWARN and, communicate via standard USMC communications systems
      to the appropriate command chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear control center (CBRNCC). The
      JEM is also used by USMC operating forces as a predictive model that provides a higher level of fidelity of
      actual ground contamination and can be used to simulate urban releases of military significant agents and
      accidental TIM releases.
      F-27. The JEM is resident on USMC C4I systems loaded with JWARN at the major subordinate command
      (MSC) level and above. It operates with the current version of Command and Control Personal Computer
      and be capable of functioning with USMC GCCS applications. JEM is resident on the intelligence
      operations workstations and operate with the Intelligence Operations Server.

U.S. NAVY
      F-28. The JEM is used at each step of the dynamic planning and execution cycle. Based on the
      commander’s intent and guidance, the current and future planning staff would use JEM in the assessment
      and development of CBRN effects on current and future plans. In addition, the intelligence staff would use
      JEM for CBRN effects analysis. The future operations and strike planning staffs would use JEM to update
      the current plans according to the optimized individual and collective CBRN effects on the current plans
      and target strike packages. Once operational plans are executed, the current operations staff would use JEM
      to assess the effects of enemy CBRN attacks and to access CBRN battle damage. The commander would
      select and execute an optimized alternative COA plan to successfully accomplish the mission. The CBRN
      effects lessons learned would be used in the next planning cycle.




F-4                       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1               28 February 2011
          Automated Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Information Management Systems



   F-29. For consequence and strike planning, JEM uses intelligence and operational SA data to prepare
   consequence analysis dispersion forecasts, according to theater guidance before the mission, for operational
   planning purposes. After the mission is completed, JEM incorporates battlefield intelligence data to prepare
   consequence plume forecast products for follow-on operations.
   F-30. At sea, JEM supports the JTF, deployed forces (carrier strike groups, and expeditionary strike
   groups, and independent units where shipboard detectors and data are networked across the theater of
   operations and data integration and analysis is conducted at a higher level C2 center). In ports where there
   is no local military CBRN command, ships coordinate with local civil disaster preparedness organizations
   and notify the established military chain of command for CBRN events. Unit C2 personnel receive JEM
   plume dispersion products via Global Command and Control System–Maritime, according to theater and
   Naval component commander guidance to assess probable CBRN effect vulnerabilities.
   F-31. For CONUS shore installations, initial JEM plume dispersion forecasts are produced by the Navy
   Atlantic Mission Essential Meteorological and Oceanographic Center, Norfolk (Naval Meteorology
   Oceanography Center) until the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) assumes responsibility as head
   of the CBRN cell. The Naval Meteorology Oceanography Center or DTRA forwards plume products
   according to respective Department of Homeland Security/JTF-Civil Support agreements for distribution
   by U.S. Northern Command. JEM data requirement reports and plume products for outside the continental
   United States (OCONUS) is prepared and distributed according to established theater and Naval component
   guidance.
   F-32. During tactical or mobile situations, unit C2 personnel receive JEM application data via Global
   Command and Control–Maritime to assess probable CBRN effect vulnerabilities to better position the unit
   for CBRN contamination avoidance and deploy sensors and assets against a probable CBRN attack threat
   axis.

U.S. AIR FORCE
   F-33. The JEM, used in conjunction with JWARN, provides commanders and warfighters with integrated
   near-real-time early warning capability. It is a DOD-accredited hazard prediction model and supports
   consequence and COA analysis for a CBRN event. The JEM supports multiple deployment strategies and is
   capable of functioning as a stand-alone, networked, or web-based application. It is integrated and fully
   interoperable with JWARN and also provides a capability to transmit vital CBRN information to the theater
   COP.

JOINT OPERATIONAL EFFECTS FEDERATION CONCEPT OF
OPERATIONS
   F-34. The JOEF supports tactical mission environment users in deliberate and, to a lesser degree, crisis
   action planning by calculating resources needed, recommending COAs, and providing deliverables
   (checklists, impact and risk assessments). It supports these users in their near-real-time crisis planning
   during and after a CBRN event by supplying consequence tools and services. JOEF decision support tools
   complement the decision support tools provided by the JWARN at the tactical level of warfare in current
   operations and during consequence phases.
   F-35. The JOEF is developed in three increments:
            Increment 1. APODs/fighter bases, SPODs, and medical and mobile forces; auto TTP and
             COE; deliberate planning (operational and strategic); and crisis planning (operational).
            Increment 2. Military consequence, deliberate and crisis action planning (operational), common
             operating environment, and uncommon operating environment.
            Increment 3. Civilian consequence (nonnetworked).

                 sector agencies.

THEATER MEDICAL INFORMATION PROGRAM
      F-39. The Theater Medical Information Program is a multi-Service system used by the USA, USMC, USN,
      and USAF. It provides information to deployed medical forces to support medical functional areas,
      including C2, medical logistics, blood management, patient regulation and evacuation, health
      threat/intelligence, health care delivery, manpower and training, and medical capabilities assessment and
      sustainment analysis.
      F-40. The Theater Medical Information Program provides a global capability which links information
      databases and integration centers that are accessible to the warfighter anywhere, anytime, and in any
      mission. The program links information from echelons of medical care in support of time-sensitive
      decisions that are critical to the success of theater operations. This information is made available to theater
      commanders through integration with the GCCS, Global Combat Support System, and Global Military
      Health System. The Theater Medical Information Program supports—
                The integration of medical capabilities under a joint CONOPS to assist the medical
                 commander/theater surgeon and to support the delivery of seamless combat medical care.
                Field medical operations and decisionmaking concerning theater medical capability by providing
                 integrated health decision support systems to ensure readiness for mission execution.
                Echelons of care through an aggregation of medical data and situation reports that serves the
                 theater of operations and sustaining base medical missions in CONUS.

         Automated Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Information Management Systems



BATTLEFIELD MEDICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS
TELEMEDICINE–JOINT
  F-41. The battlefield Medical Information Systems Telemedicine–Joint provides medics with enhanced
  data collection on the battlefield by improving data accuracy, reducing paperwork, supporting the
  collection of more complete information, eliminating redundant data entry, allowing faster adaptation to
  changing conditions, and providing access to previously unavailable information. This application allows
  the combat medic to record patient encounters to mission requirements and transfer patient records to
  higher echelons.

ARMED FORCES HEALTH LONGITUDINAL TECHNOLOGY
APPLICATION–THEATER
  F-42. The Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application–Theater is a component of Theater
  Medical Information Program. Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application-Theater is a tri-
  Service (USA, USN, and USAF) medical management automated information system that is used in
  medical treatment facilities worldwide, and it provides anytime and anywhere delivery of patient records to
  the point of care. The Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application–Theater, along with the
  Theater Medical Information Program, makes true clinical surveillance and decision support possible.

MEDICAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, DISEASE, INTELLIGENCE, AND
COUNTERMEASURES
  F-43. Medical, Environmental, Disease, Intelligence, and Countermeasures is a government, off-the-shelf
  application. It is an automated medical reference tool that is designed to provide information on worldwide
  disease and environmental health risks.

MEDICAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR COMBAT CASUALTY CARE
  F-44. The Marine aircraft wing integrates, fields, and supports a medical IM system for U.S. tactical
  medical forces, enabling a comprehensive, lifelong electronic medical record for Service members and
  enhancing medical SA for operational commanders.

GLOBAL EXPEDITIONARY MEDICAL SYSTEM
  F-45. Global Expeditionary Medical System is an integrated biohazard surveillance and detection system
  that keeps a global watch over our forces. It incorporates an electronic medical record as a basis for real-
  time data analysis and serves as the foundation of a USAF integrated surveillance and medical IM network.
  Through the Global Expeditionary Medical System, data collection, assessment, and trend analysis are
  automatically performed at the operational, tactical, and strategic levels—at units, bases, and U.S.-based
  centers of excellence. Individual, specific analysis provide quick patient diagnosis and treatment. With
  ongoing site and regional data review, population-specific analysis identifies disease trends to provide an
  early warning of outbreaks or biological attacks. The Global Expeditionary Medical System contains four
  modules.

PATIENT ENCOUNTER MODULE
  F-46. The patient encounter module collects and creates the electronic medical record. It can synchronize
  with a handheld computer platform to enhance mobility and agile documentation of patient care. The
  patient encounter module maps symptom complexes and diagnostic information for the deployed-
  population database to epidemiological tracking and analysis software in a Global Expeditionary Medical
  System unit, and it prints reports (patient encounters for the permanent record, disease and injury data). The
  Global Expeditionary Medical System does not require a dedicated server, and each laptop module has
  stand-alone capability and can support multiple handheld platforms.

Appendix F



THEATER EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODULE
      F-47. The theater epidemiological module takes the data collected by the other modules and provides
      powerful, easy-to-use analysis tools to enable the users to make fact-based decisions regarding FP, medical
      conditions or events, occupational and environmental exposure, environmental impact, and disease
      management. Primarily designed as a management tool for the prevention and aerospace medicine team
      and the JTF surgeon, the theater epidemiological module offers the automated surveillance and reporting of
      deployed force health and readiness. The theater epidemiological module is also web-enabled for IM
      capability in stability and civil support operations. It converts patient encounter data entered from the
      Global Expeditionary Medical System Patient Encounter Module into a graphic display and analysis of the
      patient data. Geographic AORs are mapped to show separate points of care, and then user-defined
      surveillance queries are automatically run on medical data from each location in the database. The first
      indication of a biological warfare release may come from the expert analysis of clinical medical data for
      military and civilian populations with symptoms that indicate exposure to a biological warfare agent.

THEATER OCCUPATIONAL MODULE
      F-48. The theater occupational module documents industrial and environmental exposures. It is a far-
      forward extension of the USAF Command Core System functionality. The Theater Occupational Module is
      able to record, track, and monitor occupational and environmental concerns in the expeditionary setting.
      Working in concert with the patient Encounter Module and the Theater epidemiological module, industrial
      health and environmental issues may be linked to individual patients or analyzed for work group, location,
      and theater events and trends.

PUBLIC HEALTH DEPLOYED MODULE
      F-49. The public health deployment module documents preventive medicine-related information and
      exposures. It can be expanded to work from a handheld unit for most evaluations. Information is
      aggregated at progressively higher levels, allowing for accurate theater assessment, epidemiological
      monitoring, and decisionmaking. The public health deployment module is an intuitive data-linked tool for
      public health personnel and/or independent duty medical technicians to record preventive medicine
      assessments. It is applicable to—
               Food inspections.
               Operational rations.
               Food facility inspections.
               Public facility inspections.
               Medical entomology.
               Communicable diseases.

NOTIFICATION OF COMMUNITY-BASED EPIDEMICS
      F-50. The purpose of the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based
      Epidemics is to provide early warning of abnormal health conditions that may be the result of bioterrorism
      or disease outbreak. In addition, it is a valuable medical SA tool for epidemiologists and health officials
      who continually monitor the health of their communities. It receives a variety of health indicator data
      (doctor visit information, emergency room primary complaints, sales of over-the-counter drugs, school
      absenteeism). The system integrates clinical and nonclinical human behavior indicators as a means of
      identifying the abnormality as close to the time of symptoms onset as possible.




F-8                       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1               28 February 2011
                                            Appendix G
                                 Preparation Activities
       The basic element for maintaining adequate preparedness is a clear understanding of
       the CBRN threat, hazards, and operational requirements, CONUS and OCONUS. To
       support operational requirements, commanders’ preparation activities must identify
       specific mission-essential CBRN tasks that facilitate operations in CBRN
       environments. During preparation activities, the emphasis is on evaluating operation
       progress, identifying variances, and determining the significance of those variances.
       Preparation allows friendly forces to improve their chances of success.

CONSIDERATIONS
   G-1. Commanders of forces and facilities must assess vulnerabilities that may compromise peacetime
   preparedness. The actions that commanders take to reduce vulnerabilities depend on their assigned
   missions and supporting plans. During preparation, commanders use the understand-visualize-describe-
   direct methodology to exercise C2. Commanders update and validate their visualization as relevant
   information and assessments based on the running estimates received. Commanders’ SA changes as they
   receive new information—assumptions may prove true or false, intelligence may confirm or deny enemy
   actions and conditions in their OE, or the status of friendly forces may change. As their SA changes,
   commanders apply judgment to determine the significance of the changes and their possible effects on the
   operation. Significant new information produces a new situational understanding and requires commanders
   to make one of the following assessments with respect to the order:
             New information validates the order with no further changes.
             New information requires adjusting the order.
             New information invalidates the order.
   G-2. The preparation for operations in CBRN environments includes the measures taken by commanders,
   with appropriate emphasis on—
            Conducting CBRN threat assessment.
            Evaluating force and unit status.
            Assessing training readiness.
            Ensuring coordinated planning.
            Conducting training.
            Taking medical protective measures.
            Verifying and exercising warning and reporting information networks.
            Preparing CBRND units, equipment, and supplies.
            Coordinating for HN support, as required.
            Verifying responsibility for coordinating CBRN defensive activities within an AO (determining
             which unit provides the base cluster commander and who is responsible for terrain
             management).
            Revising and refining the order or plan.
            Conducting rehearsals.
            Task-organizing.
            Conducting troop movements.
            Conducting preoperation checks and inspections.
            Conducting logistics preparations (during execution, this includes recovery and rearming).




28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                           G-1
Appendix G



               Integrating new warfighters and units.
               Providing subordinate confirmation briefs and backbriefs.

RECONNAISSANCE AND SURVEILLANCE OPERATIONS
      G-3. Reconnaissance and surveillance operations often begin during planning to fill information gaps that
      are identified during mission analysis and support the integrating processes. Such operations are evaluated
      against operation security considerations so that friendly operations are not compromised. CBRN units
      prepare by providing reconnaissance for their specific mission areas. Timely reporting allows the CBRNC
      to assess the total status of mission resources and assign recovery forces where they are most effective.
      Unit CBRN reconnaissance teams and individuals generally do not begin operations until directed to do so
      by the CBRNC.

ORDER OR PLAN REVISION OR REFINEMENT
      G-4. Plan refinement consists primarily of revising the plan based on changes in the situation and
      command and staff visits to subordinate elements.

COORDINATION AND LIAISON
      G-5. Battle rhythm is a control measure and integrative process that assists with synchronizing the
      continuing activities and integrating processes during preparation. It establishes a schedule for commanders
      and staffs that synchronize routine meetings, working groups, and reports. Mission coordination must be
      thorough and detailed since CBRN reconnaissance assets act semi-independently, temporarily move
      beyond direct-fire support of the supported unit, and occasionally operate forward of friendly units.
      G-6. Close coordination with the supported unit is also necessary during defensive operations. This will
      reduce the possibility of fratricide. Items to coordinate with the supported unit include—
                Changes and updates in the enemy and friendly situations.
                The best use of terrain for CBRN operations.
                Light and weather data.
                Rehearsal areas and times.
                Special equipment requirements.
                HSS, including medical evacuation.
                Logistics support.
                Signal plan call signs, frequencies, code words, pyrotechnics, challenges, and passwords.
                Identification tools to reduce the incidence of fratricide.
      G-7. Operations may require the application of specialized CBRN assets which have detection capabilities
      that exceed those found in most military units (lower detection thresholds). These activities may require
      intensive coordination and cooperation with multinational forces, HN civil authorities, and other U.S.
      government agencies that offer specialized capabilities and skills.

REHEARSALS
      G-8. Rehearsals are the commander’s tool for ensuring that staffs and subordinates understand the
      commander’s intent and CONOPS. Rehearsals allow subordinate units and leaders to analyze the tactical
      plan to confirm its feasibility, and practicality and the adequacy of its C2 measures. For CBRN units and
      staff to be effectively and efficiently employed in combat, rehearsals need to become habitual in training.
      Units at every level should routinely train and practice a variety of rehearsal types and techniques. Local
      SOPs should identify appropriate rehearsal types, techniques, and standards for their execution.
      G-9. Time is the key to conducting rehearsals, and time is probably the most precious resource available
      to commanders and units. When time is at a premium, the CBRN battle staff conducts reduced rehearsals,
      focusing only on critical events, using the backward planning cycle.

  G-10. Key support factors need to be part of the rehearsal, including plans for casualty evacuation, routes,
  ambulance exchange point locations, refuel on the move, Class IV and Class V resupply points, and
  logistics release points. These items should be injected into the rehearsal at the appropriate times by the
  coordinating CBRN staff officer. Summarizing these actions at the end of the rehearsal weakens the value
  of the rehearsal as a coordination tool.

PRECOMBAT CHECKS/INSPECTIONS
  G-11. At the tactical level, precombat checks and inspections provide a start point for readiness. Unit SOPs
  and equipment operations and maintenance manuals should be used as a basis for conducting precombat
  checks/inspections.
  G-12. These procedures can be conducted in three different fashions: by the team leader, by the unit leader,
  and by a CBRN SME. When the team leader conducts precombat checks/inspections, it reinforces the
  warfighters’ trust in their team leader and ensures that the warfighters report ready to execute the mission
  when they report for duty. When the unit leader executes precombat checks/precombat inspections, it
  ensures that the leadership is comfortable that the warfighters and their equipment are ready to execute the
  mission. Finally, when a subject matter expert conducts the precombat checks/inspections (mechanics
  performing preventive-maintenance checks and services, medics inspecting the combat lifesaver bags for
  readiness), it enhances the chance of a successful mission.
  G-13. The following are some of the tasks that should be considered when conducting precombat
  checks/inspections:
           Vehicles. Each vehicle must be inspected for serviceability. At a minimum, a complete
            preventive-maintenance checks and services inspection should be conducted before mission
            execution. Check fluid levels, personnel equipment storage, and load plans.
           Weapons. Weapons must be inspected for cleanliness and serviceability. Ensure that Service
            members can perform proper maintenance and function checks on their assigned weapons.
            Check each Service member’s qualification record to ensure that the Service member is qualified
            on the weapon. Finally, check the ammunition and magazines to ensure cleanliness and
            serviceability.
           Individual. Leaders must ensure that their team’s personal equipment is serviceable, including
            uniforms, personal-hygiene items, food, and water.
           Communications. Communications equipment must be serviceable. Ensure that each radio has
            the proper frequencies programmed, to include team, company, battalion, and supported unit
            command. Ensure spare hand microphones, batteries, and cables are available.
           CBRN. Check the serviceability of identification and detection equipment, and ensure that it is
            positioned so that the crew can easily use it. Ensure sufficient spare batteries are present.
           SA. Team members need to maintain SA of the operations being conducted. This includes
            understanding applicable orders, call signs and frequencies, challenges and passwords, and
            support element operations.
  G-14. Unit or team level precombat checks/inspections checklists are useful to ensure that areas of concern
  are addressed during the preparation phase of an operation. Such checklists provide members of the unit
  with a standardized format to assist leaders in preparing their teams for operations.

EXERCISE CONSIDERATIONS
  G-15. The exercise experience is a dynamic and interactive way to learn the intricate parts of warfighter
  procedures and skills. CBRN principles, decision support tools, and TTP must be integrated into significant
  exercises and war games to offer additional opportunities to develop and evaluate individual and unit
  CBRN competencies. Commanders should continually assess the impact of training, exercises, and war
  games on their units’ abilities to conduct wartime missions.
  G-16. To ensure effectiveness, CBRN education and training must be validated through exercises and war
  games, using time-tested principles and experience. Providing an exercise environment for warfighters to
  hone CBRN knowledge and skills is critical. Exercises and war games serve as effective methods of



  28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                            G-3
Appendix G



      developing individual experience and organizational capabilities under controlled conditions. In addition to
      providing instruction, they may also aid in evaluating performance and the effectiveness of training and
      education programs.
      G-17. Exercises and war games should include a realistic CBRN element, emphasize critical thinking, and
      require participants to demonstrate their skills in personal protection, performing wartime functions and
      working together as an integrated unit in a simulated CBRN-contaminated area. CBRN exercises and war
      games should emphasize the aspects of operations in a CBRN environment, to include C2, emergency
      management, postattack ISR, planning, logistics, medical response, FP, and individual and collective
      protection. When possible, units should also conduct joint, allied, and coalition CBRN exercises to develop
      and improve interoperability.

TRANSITION TO EXECUTION
      G-18. There are multiple preparatory considerations that support the actions involved in the transition to
      sustained operations. CBRN preparatory considerations can include the following:
                Intelligence. Commanders and CBRN staffs use IPOE/IPB to direct CBRN operations. They
                 gain information that is critical to making decisions in defined areas and specific locations
                 (assigning CBRN reconnaissance elements to cover specific NAIs).
                Force organization and training. Units train and exercise CBRN detection and identification
                 capabilities as part of their integrated CBRN warning and reporting network. Leaders understand
                 CBRN detection capabilities, and staffs prepare effective employment plans that maximize the
                 probability of detection. Unit leaders assess team and overall unit performance and ensure that
                 CBRN-related factors (environmental impact on detections) are understood.
                Theater access maintenance. Contingency planning ensures that required CBRN assets are
                 included on the time-phased force and deployment list. The list is also evaluated to ensure
                 inclusion of technical escort, medical laboratory, and CBRN unit resources (C2 elements, C2
                 control centers) as appropriate.
                Logistics support and sustainment. Commander and staff planning sustains CBRN
                 capabilities, ranging from designating decontamination points for CBRN decontamination assets
                 to ensuring system level contracted logistics support.
                Physical environment. Seasonal effects on terrain, weather, and sea conditions are carefully
                 assessed before and during operations to determine the potential impact on CBRN capabilities.




G-4                       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                28 February 2011
                                            Appendix H
            Technical Reachback and Other Capabilities
        Technical reachback is the ability to contact a technical SME when an issue exceeds
        the on-scene SME’s capability. Reachback should be conducted by using established
        unit protocols. Many of the listed reachback resources included in this appendix have
        other primary missions and are not specifically resourced for reachback functions.

ISSUES
   H-1. Issues appropriate for technical reachback may include the following:
           Identification of nonstandard CBRN warfare agents. Military responders are trained to detect
            and identify certain military warfare agents. If a TIM is used or suspected, military personnel
            must obtain nonstandard technical information. This information could include persistency,
            medical effects, and decontamination or protection requirements.
           Modeling. Technical reachback should provide the ability for detailed analysis of the area to
            assist in determining downwind hazard areas and locating staging areas, operations centers, and
            decontamination sites.
           CBRN agent sample evacuation. Technical evaluation of evacuated samples can provide
            critical information for patient treatment and/or be used as evidence for prosecution.
           Hazard prediction. Technical experts can use modeling to provide a better indication of where
            vapor, liquid, or aerosolized hazards may occur.
   H-2. Reachback can be accomplished through various means, from the telephone to broadband satellites;
   however, IM protocols and the chain of command must be followed before using a hotline number. (See
   table H-1 for some common technical reachback numbers.)

NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL
HOTLINE
   H-3. The CB hot line is a joint effort of the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Federal Bureau of Investigation,
   Federal Emergency Management Agency, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Health
   and Human Services, and DOD. The National Response Center is the entry point for the CB hot line.
   H-4. The intended users of the hot line include trained emergency personnel (emergency operators, first
   responders [firefighters, police, emergency medical technicians]) who arrive at the scene of a CB terrorist
   incident. Other potential users may include state EOCs and hospitals that may treat victims of agent
   exposure.
   H-5. The USCG staffs the hot line 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. Trained operators use extensive
   databases and reference material in addition to having immediate access to the nation’s top SMEs in the CB
   agent field. National Response Center duty officers take reports of actual or potential domestic terrorism
   and link emergency calls with applicable DOD SMEs for technical assistance and with the Federal Bureau
   of Investigation to initiate the federal response actions. The National Response Center also provides reports
   and notifications to other federal agencies as necessary. Specialty areas include the following:
             Detection equipment.
             Personal protective equipment.
             Decontamination systems and methods.

      acquisition and fielding of CB detection and reconnaissance systems; individual and collective-protection
      systems; decontamination systems; IM systems; medical devices, drugs, and vaccines; and installation
      protection programs and FP systems. As true “joint” project managers, there is no “Service lead” in
      developing and procuring capabilities. Each JPM is responsible to the Services for delivering required
      capabilities. Located throughout the United States, joint project offices leverage the talents and expertise of
      the Services under a single chain of command. Each JPM ensures that system developments focus on
      customers’ needs within cost, schedule, and performance parameters.

CONTAMINATION AVOIDANCE
      H-21. The JPM for NBC contamination avoidance is responsible for the development, production, testing,
      and fielding of CBRN detection, obscuration, and reconnaissance systems. The JPM for contamination
      avoidance has the additional responsibility for fielding of and training on new equipment.
      H-22. The earliest possible warning is fundamental in avoiding CB agent contamination. The goal of
      contamination avoidance is to provide a real-time capability to detect, identify, map, quantify, and avoid
      CB agents in the OE, including selected TIMs.
      H-23. The Chemical-Biological Defense Program pursues technologies that incorporate and integrate
      standoff and early warning, reconnaissance, CB point detection, and information processing. The
      technology focus is on increased detection sensitivity, lower detection thresholds, specificity across the
      evolving spectrum of threat agents, reduced false-alarm rates, and integration of detectors into various
      mapping and communication networks to provide common warning and reporting to the joint force.

BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE
      H-24. The JPM for biological defense provides defensive equipment and technology to detect and identify
      biological threats in near real time and collect and assimilate data for commanders who require an
      understanding of the biological threat situation in their AO. Their biological defensive systems are critical
      to the areas of CBRN sense, shield, and sustain; to meet the needs of U.S. forces; to warn personnel of
      imminent hazards (preattack); and to aid in the treatment of personnel exposed to a biological hazard
      (postattack). The JPM for biological defense covers defense systems within areas of biological point
      detection, standoff detection, and surveillance.

U.S. Army Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear
             Capabilities and Employment
          This appendix provides an overview of U.S. Army Chemical Corps and related
          organizational capabilities that conduct CBRN operations in support of USA and
          joint force commanders and doctrinal employment. It provides the organizational
          structure, doctrinal mission, corresponding key tasks, organizational capabilities and
          dependencies, and tactical employment considerations for CBRN units and staffs,
          from platoon to theater level. In addition, this appendix incorporates the USA
          modular force transformation for CBRN units and staffs. Tables of organization and
          equipment (TOE) and tables of distribution and allowances data are specifically
          excluded as they may change during modular force transformation initiatives.
          Specific TOE or tables of distribution and allowances reference data is provided so
          that the user can research the latest automated, approved authorization documents on
          the U.S. Army Force Management Support Agency Web site at
          <https://webtaads.belvoir.army.mil/usafmsa/>.

U.S. ARMY OPERATIONAL CONCEPT
   I-1. The USA operational concept is full spectrum operations—the simultaneous execution of offense,
   defense, and stability or civil support. Commanders apply the elements of combat power through a
   combination of leadership, information, and the six warfighting functions. Commanders primarily conduct
   CBRN operations in support of the protection warfighting function, although CBRN operations also apply
   to the remaining warfighting functions—intelligence, movement and maneuver, C2, sustainment, and
   fires—to some degree. (See FM 3-0 for more information.)

U.S. ARMY MODULAR FORCE
   I-2. The USA modular force incorporates organizational CBRN capabilities into company, battalion,
   brigade, division, corps, and Army level echelons. Modular brigade echelons include three types: brigade
   combat teams, support brigades, and functional brigades. The following are the three types of brigade
   combat teams:
             Infantry brigade combat team (IBCT).
             Heavy brigade combat team (HBCT).
             Stryker brigade combat team (SBCT).
   I-3.    The following are modular support brigades:
              Maneuver enhancement brigade.
              Battlefield surveillance brigade.
              Sustainment brigade.
              Combat aviation brigade.
              Fires brigade.
   I-4. Finally, there are various functional brigades, to include the CBRN brigade. (See FM 3-0 for more
   information on USA modular organizations and employment.)

Appendix I



CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
OPERATIONAL CONCEPT
      I-5. The USA Chemical Corps’ operational concept is to conduct CBRN operations in support of
      combating WMD and the protection warfighting function by employing platoon-size CBRN forces and
      specialized technical elements or teams, task-organized to an appropriate CBRN or other C2 headquarters.

MODULAR CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND
NUCLEAR FORCES
      I-6. The USA Chemical Corps maintains three major force capabilities: CBRN units, CBRN staffs, and
      specialized teams and task forces. (See figure I-1 for the three categories.)




               Legend:

                                     Figure I-1. Major force capabilities

      I-7. The USA Chemical Corps CBRN units include platoon, company, battalion, functional brigade, and
      special operations organizations. This diverse group provides a CBRN operational capability that is tailored
      with functional and multifunctional units to protect the force from CBRN threats and hazards during the
      conduct of full spectrum operations (USA) and during joint operations.
      I-8. The USA Chemical Corps supports the USA modular force design by incorporating staff personnel
      in a combination of CBRN officers, CBRN NCOs, and/or CBRN specialists at the company, battalion,
      brigade, division, corps, and Army service component command echelons. In addition, the CBRN
      coordination element (CBRN-CE) provides staff augmentation to Army Service Component Command
      echelons.
      I-9. The USA also provides a number of additional specialized capabilities to support CBRN operations,
      to include a CBRNE operational headquarters, special operating forces, and medical and civil support.
      These are discussed in more detail later in this appendix.

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
UNITS IN THE MODULAR FORCE
      I-10. CBRN units support land-based operations from the platoon to brigade level and also support special
      operations. The platoon is the functional unit module for CBRN passive defense and battlefield
      obscuration. CBRN platoons are organized as organic assets to brigade combat teams (CBRN
      reconnaissance platoons) or to CBRN companies. The CBRN company is the smallest CBRN operational
      unit that has its own dedicated TOE. (See figure I-2 for the various CBRN operational units.)

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
RECONNAISSANCE PLATOONS
   I-11. The USA Chemical Corps maintains multiple variants of the CBRN reconnaissance platoon in the
   modular force design. The platoons vary by mission, crew size, assigned equipment, and mobility platform.
   If organic to the brigade combat teams, they are assigned to the brigade special troops battalion for IBCTs
   and HBCTs, or to the reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition squadron in the SBCT.
   I-12. CBRN reconnaissance platoons fall into two general categories—light and armored. The light CBRN
   reconnaissance platoons employ a light or up-armored wheeled platform (for example, a high-mobility,
   multipurpose, wheeled vehicle) and are organic to the IBCT with two crews and to the the CBRN company
   (area support) with six crews. The armored CBRN reconnaissance platoons employ an armored wheeled
   platform (for example, M93-series Fox or Stryker NBC reconnaissance vehicle) and are organic to the
   HBCT with two crews, SBCT with three crews, and CBRN company (maneuver support [MANSPT]) with
   six crews. (See figures I-3 through I-7, pages I-4 through I-8, for more information on CBRN
   reconnaissance platoons.)

EQUIPMENT DECONTAMINATION
   I-16. The primary mission of decontamination platoons is military equipment decontamination at the
   operational and thorough levels. Some equipment (USA aircraft, sensitive equipment) requires unique
   decontamination planning and execution. (See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for
   Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Decontamination for more information.)

PERSONNEL AND CASUALTY DECONTAMINATION
   I-17. CBRN decontamination platoons have an organic capability to decontaminate personnel by
   employing an accessory shower assembly (if equipped).
   I-18. Some CBRN decontamination platoons may even be equipped with mass casualty decontamination
   systems similar to those used by civil authorities. Such equipment is generally limited to civil support mass
   casualty decontamination and the process is best conducted under medical supervision. (See Multiservice
   Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Consequence
   Management Operations for more information on mass casualty decontamination.)

PATIENT DECONTAMINATION
   I-19. CBRN decontamination platoons may support medical operations by augmenting designated patient
   decontamination sites according to the HSS plan. (See FM 4-02.7 for more information.)

CONTAMINATED-REMAINS DECONTAMINATION
   I-20. CBRN decontamination platoons may support mortuary affairs operations by providing
   augmentation to contaminated-remains decontamination at the designated mortuary affairs decontamination
   collection point. (See JP 3-06 for more information.)

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
PLATOONS (BIOLOGICAL)
   I-21. The USA Chemical Corps maintains biological platoons that employ Biological Integrated Detection
   Systems in a surveillance mode of operation. The biological platoon is organized with a platoon
   headquarters and subordinate biological teams.
   I-22. Biological platoons may operate in an area array configuration to protect key troop concentrations
   (reception, staging, onward movement, integration, staging, tactical assembly areas). They may also
   operate in a critical node configuration to protect installations, key C2 facilities, or other strategic sites.
   (See figure I-10, page I-12, for more information on the CBRN platoon [biological].)

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
PLATOONS (OBSCURATION)
       I-23. The USA Chemical Corps maintains two variants of the CBRN obscuration platoon in the modular
       force design. The primary difference lies with the mobility platform—one variant is mechanized, and the
       other variant is wheeled. Each platoon is organized with a platoon headquarters section and two squads,
       with a third squad operating as the support element. Obscuration platoons provide large-area obscuration to
       protect the supported force and enable movement and maneuver. CBRN obscuration platoons typically
       provide temporary obscuration for single, short-term missions. They may also provide sustained
       obscuration by integrating on-line fog oil resupply into the operation. Obscurants include visual- or
       infrared-defeating obscuration or a combination of the two. (See FM 3-11.50 for more information.)
       I-24. Mechanized obscuration platoons operate primarily in support of brigade combat teams due to their
       greater survivability and rough-terrain mobility capability. Wheeled obscuration platoons operate primarily

       I-38. A CBRN staff section or element performs the same basic duties at most echelons of command. In
       addition to common staff responsibilities, CBRN staff-specific responsibilities fall into the four basic
       activities of the operations process: assessment (continuous), planning, preparation, and execution. (See
       table I-1 for the core functions of a CBRN section.)

Appendix I



CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR SPECIAL STAFFS
       I-39. CBRN special staffs exist at the battalion and brigade levels. These staff sections provide technical
       advice to the commander for the unit employment of capabilities for the conduct of CBRN operations, and
       they supervise the organizational readiness of the command for operations in CBRN environments.

BATTALION CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR SPECIAL STAFF
       I-40. The battalion CBRN staff typically includes a CBRN officer (lieutenant) and CBRN NCO (staff
       sergeant); and in some organizations, may only include a CBRN NCO (staff sergeant or sergeant first
       class). Many battalion-size units also have a CBRN specialist assigned to assist in the employment of
       organic operational-level decontamination capabilities. This staff performs core CBRN staff functions, as
       applicable, with emphasis on the following key tasks:
                 Advise the commander on all CBRN hazards, ranging from WMD to TIM.
                 Implement CBRN protective measures.
                 Provide CBRN warning and reporting.
                 Prepare CBRN plans and orders.
                 Plan operational-level decontamination missions.
                 Train and mentor company level CBRN Soldiers.

BRIGADE CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR SPECIAL STAFF
       I-41. The brigade CBRN staff typically includes a CBRN officer (captain or major) and CBRN NCO
       (sergeant first class); and in some organizations, may only include a senior CBRN NCO (sergeant first
       class). Brigade combat teams have organic CBRN reconnaissance platoons, so the CBRN staff
       recommends its employment and the employment of any additional CBRN assets that may be task-
       organized as a part of the combined arms team. Maneuver enhancement brigade CBRN staffs are more
       robust and complex than the brigade combat team or functional brigade staffs (see FM 3-90.31 for more
       information on MEBs). This staff performs core CBRN staff functions, as applicable, with emphasis on the
       following key tasks:
                 Advise the commander on all CBRN hazards, ranging from WMD to TIM.
                 Plan CBRN unit employment.
                 Prepare and process CBRN warning and reporting information.
                 Prepare contamination predictions.
                 Plan thorough-level decontamination operations.
                 Plan sensitive-site operations for CBRN-related activities.

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH-YIELD EXPLOSIVES
ELEMENTS
       I-42. Division and higher echelon specialty staffs include a more robust CBRN staff that is integrated with
       EOD personnel to form CBRNE elements.

DIVISION CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH-YIELD
EXPLOSIVES ELEMENT
       I-43. The division CBRNE element (TOE 87000G900) operates as a part of the division protection cell
       located in the main command post. This element provides CBRNE personnel to support tactical command
       post functions as required. In addition, it provides support to the division plans cell as needed. The division
       CBRNE element performs most of the core CBRNE staff functions as required and as necessary to support
       division level operations or a joint task force if designated.

CORPS CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, HIGH-YIELD EXPLOSIVES
ELEMENT
   I-44. The corps CBRNE element (TOE 52400G900) operates in a similar manner to that of the division,
   but operates as a part of the operational protection cell located in the main command post. This element
   provides CBRNE personnel to support alternate command post functions as required. In addition, it
   provides support to the corps plans cell as needed and will participate as a member of the targeting board in
   considering actions related to WMD sensitive sites. The corps CBRNE element performs most of the core
   CBRN staff functions as required for tactical-level operations, and as necessary to support Corps level
   operations or as a joint task force if designated.

ARMY SERVICE COMPONENT COMMAND CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL,
NUCLEAR, AND HIGH-YIELD EXPLOSIVES ELEMENT
   I-45. The Army Service Component Command (ASCC) CBRNE element (TOE 51600G000) supports a
   unified or combatant command and operates in a similar manner to that of the Corps as a part of the
   Operational Protection Cell located in the main command post. This element provides CBRNE personnel to
   support alternate command post functions as required. In addition, it provides support to the plans cell as
   needed, and will participate as a member of the targeting board in considering actions related to WMD
   sensitive sites. The ASCC will typically be augmented by the CBRNE coordination element, to support
   continuous operations consistent with information management associated with WMD and other CBRNE
   hazards in the operational area. The ASCC CBRNE element performs most of the core CBRNE staff
   functions as required with an operational-level focus and as necessary to support ASCC level operations or
   as a joint task force if designated.

SPECIALIZED TEAMS AND TASK FORCES
   I-46. The USA Chemical Corps maintains the predominance of the organization CBRN capabilities for the
   USA; and in some cases, for the Joint force. In addition, the USA maintains other organizational capbilities
   related to CBRN operations (operational commands, special operating forces, medical, EOD, civil support).
   This section highlights these additional capabilities and directs the reader to additional references related to
   their missions, tasks, capabilities, and employment considerations.
CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR,                             AND    HIGH-YIELD EXPLOSIVES
OPERATIONAL HEADQUARTERS
   I-47. The CBRNE operational headquarters is designed, staffed, and trained to be the controlling
   headquarters to identify, target, plan, and coordinate service response to WMD threats in support of
   national combating WMD objectives. By design, this headquarters executes, tracks, and manages the
   response and provides C2 for Army and/or joint specialized CBRNE forces; executes WMD-elimination
   missions; and provides techical capabilities and CBRNE subject matter expertise to joint and Army
   commanders. Elements of this headquarters are designed to deploy and provide the core elements of a JTF
   headquarters in support of WMD-elimination or similar missions. The inclusion of a joint elimination
   coordination element that is provided by the U.S. Strategic Command is an essential element of a JTF
   headquarters. (See FMI 3-90.10 for more information.)
CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR RECONNAISSANCE
DETACHMENT
   I-48. The CRD plans, conducts, and provides CBRN reconnaissance and surveillance support for special
   operating forces in support of strategic, operational, and tactical objectives in all environments to support
   functional and geographic combatant commanders’ intents and objectives. (See FM 3-05.132 for more
   information on CRDs and other CBRN-related, special-operations capabilities.)
MEDICAL
   I-49. The USA maintains several organizational capabilities to provide HSS in CBRN environments.
   Examples include casualty prevention, casualty care and management, patient movement, patient

       decontamination, veterinary service support, food and water safety, medical laboratory support, combat and
       operational stress control, health service logistics support, civil support, and individual and collective
       protection. (See FM 4-02.7 for more information.)
CIVIL SUPPORT
       I-50. The USA in concert with other Services, may contribute to the DOD support to other lead federal
       agencies (Department of Homeland Security for domestic CBRN incidents). The National Guard Bureau
       maintains CBRN response forces that are under state government control according to Title 32 United
       States Code (USC), but may be federalized to respond to CBRNE incidents under Title 10 USC. The USA
       also provides forces to support the commander U.S. Northern Command Title 10 USC response plan which
       employs joint task force-combat support (JTF-CS) and potentially other JTFs for consequence
       management. These forces include—
                 Weapons of mass destruction–civil support teams (WMD-CST). The WMD-CSTs consist of
                  both ARNG and ANG personnel, and are designated to provide a specialized capability in
                  response to a CBRN incident, primarily within Title 32 USC operations status within the United
                  States and its territories, as established by Title 10 USC. Responding under the authority of the
                  governor, they support civil authorities at a domestic CBRN incident site by identifying CBRN
                  agents, assessing current and projected consequences, advising on response measures, and
                  assisting with appropriate requests for additional support. The WMD-CSTs may also be
                  federalized and deployed as a part of a federal response to an incident within or outside the
                  WMD-CST assigned state. (See FM 3-11.22 for more information.)
                 Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives emergency response
                  force package (CERFP). The CERFP is a battalion-size task force tailored with existing ARNG
                  units that are mobilized under Title 32 USC to provide a regional response in the event of a
                  CBRNE incident. The CERFP follows WMD-CST capabilities during the immediate and
                  reinforcing response phases of the response spectrum. The CERFP deploys to CBRNE incident
                  sites to provide civil support to incident commanders by conducting consequence management
                  operations to save lives and prevent human suffering. The CERFP units maintain additional
                  specialized equipment and receive specialized training to perform safe operations in a CBRN
                  environment. (See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological,
                  Radiological, and Nuclear Consequence Management Operations for more information.)
                 Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives consequence
                  management response force (CCMRF). The CCMRF mission under the JTF-CS or other
                  designated JTF includes brigade-size combined arms task forces tailored as a reinforcing effort
                  in response to CBRNE incidents, and operates under Title 10 USC authority and in support of
                  the commander U.S. Northern Command. A CCMRF task force constitutes most of the JTF-CS
                  task force response requirements, and provides force-tailored capabilities (casualty
                  decontamination, security operations, medical triage and treatment, aviation, logistics,
                  transportation). (See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical,
                  Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Consequence Management Operations for more
                  information.)
CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR COORDINATION ELEMENT
       I-51. The CBRN-CE (TOE 03579LA00) provides staff augmentation to the ASCC for theater Army level
       CBRN staff planning, operations, and logistics support. The CBRN coordination element is a five-person
       cell, consisting of CBRN personnel who are led by a CBRN officer (typically a captain). (See figure I-22
       for CBRN-CE.)

                                              Appendix J
    U.S. Air Force Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
             Nuclear Capabilities and Employment
       This appendix provides an overview of the capabilities that USAF CBRN units and
       staffs provide to commanders. USAF CBRN defense operations provide a multitiered
       capability to combat WMD. Through complementary structures, these USAF
       capabilities ensure that the USAF will prevail in conflicts when an adversary
       possesses or uses CBRN weapons or devices. USAF capabilities to counter the
       CBRN threat are described within five interlinked counter-CBRN pillars:
       proliferation prevention, counterforce, active defense, passive defense, and
       consequence. These pillars, specific to the USAF mission, complement the broader
       pillars of nonproliferation, counterproliferation, and consequence identified in the
       National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction and the eight mission
       areas described in the National Military Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass
       Destruction. Specific to this document are the USAF pillars of passive defense and
       consequence, which provide the framework for describing USAF CBRN defense
       capabilities.

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
DEFENSE CAPABILITIES
   J-1. The USAF emergency management program provides the capabilities to shape the OE, sense threats,
   shield resources from the deleterious effects of contamination, and sustain force survivability and mission
   continuation—in a CBRN environment—in support of passive defense and consequence. Warrior Airmen
   with CBRN-unique equipment and assigned to specific UTCs achieve goals within this structure by
   executing incident-specific, installation-wide, and theater-wide TTP in support of CCDRs.
   J-2. These UTCs provide scalable, tailorable, and flexible options for commanders at all echelons through
   the five phases of emergency management: prevent, prepare, respond, recover, and mitigate. The UTC
   capability descriptions described below are typical, but not all-inclusive. USAF civil engineer squadrons
   and civil engineer groups at installation level are staffed by expert CBRN personnel in the Air Force
   specialty 3E9X1, USAF Emergency Management. Therefore, the readiness and emergency management
   flight in civil engineer squadrons and/or civil engineer groups manages and executes “W-Series” UTC
   capabilities. At major command and Air Staff levels, CBRN defense capabilities reside primarily on the
   installations and mission support (A7) staffs. The UTCs are as follows:
              Personnel UTC 4F9WA. This UTC consists of one consequence sergeant/E9 that provides
               strategic emergency management and counter-CBRN theater management to the JTF
               commander and the air operations center.
              Personnel UTC 4F9WB. This UTC consists of one senior master sergeant/E8 that provides
               operational emergency management and counter-CBRN theater management to the JTF
               commander and the air operations center.
              Personnel UTC 4F9WC. This UTC consists of one master sergeant/E7 that provides an
               emergency management and counter-CBRN installation manager to the installation control
               center, EOC, or readiness and emergency management flight.
              Personnel UTC 4F9WD. This UTC consists of one technical sergeant/E6 and one staff
               sergeant/E5 that provide core operational and tactical leadership for counter-CBRN response for
               a single, fixed installation in the tactical AO.

Appendix J



               Personnel UTC 4F9WE. This UTC consists of two junior NCOs or Airmen (E3–E5) that
                provide a core tactical team for CBRN incident response, ranging from sensitive-site
                exploitation to large-area reconnaissance, following a CBRN theater ballistic missile attack. This
                UTC provides the bulk of USAF CBRN defense forces.
               Equipment UTC 4F9WL. This UTC provides equipment for active CBRN response
                capabilities to conduct area, site, and facility survey; CBRN and TIM downwind hazard
                analysis; contaminated-area cordon definition, reduction, and expansion; identification of
                unknown substances and preliminary vapor, aerosol, solid, and liquid detection; and hazard
                plume modeling, investigation, and contamination extent.
               Equipment UTC 4F9WN. This UTC provides CBRN detection equipment for warning,
                reporting, and notification capabilities to forces supporting major contingency operations or
                asymmetrical threat responses.
               Equipment UTC 4F9WP. This UTC provides additional CBRN equipment to support UTC
                4F9WN during major contingency operations or equipment/supplies necessary for CBRN
                detection, warning, reporting, and notification capabilities to bases located in medium- and low-
                threat areas.
               Equipment UTC 4F9WS. This UTC provides initial equipment for CBRN personnel
                decontamination capability for an installation with up to 3,300 personnel.
               Equipment UTC 4F9WM. This UTC provides in-garrison CBRN equipment to support force
                survivability and critical mission continuation response capabilities. It provides the ability to
                conduct response staging area assessment, downwind hazard analysis, initial cordon definition,
                cordon reduction/expansion, ground survey assessment, site/facility assessment/investigation,
                and unknown substance response. The UTC also provides preliminary vapor/aerosol and
                solid/liquid detection, hazard modeling with COP inputs, and hazard investigation and defines
                the extent of contamination for the incident commander, EOC director, and installation control
                center in support of mission requirements.

INSTALLATION LEVEL MEDICAL AND PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
SUPPORT CAPABILITIES
      J-3. The “F-Series” UTC health risk assessment capabilities support the emergency management
      program; they are managed/executed by the USAF bioenvironmental function within medical squadrons
      and groups at installation level and on strike group staffs at headquarters level. USAF bioenvironmental
      specialists serve in Air Force specialty 43EX (officer) and 4B0X1 (enlisted), USAF bioenvironmental. The
      UTCs are as follows:
                 UTC FFPM1/2/3 Preventive Aerospace Medicine Team. This UTC conducts public health,
                  occupational, environmental, disease assessment, and surveillance, intervention, and abatement
                  activities. It performs health risk assessments to support/enable mission effectiveness.
                 UTC FFGLB Wartime Medical Decontamination Team. This UTC provides support
                  personnel to remove or neutralize CBRN agents on wartime casualties prior to admission to

              from radiation/nuclear events.

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
DEFENSE SUPPORT ASSETS
   J-5.   The following are CBRN defense support assets:
             Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency. The emergency management division plans, trains,
              equips, and conducts USAF emergency management programs that include CBRNE, WMD, and
              hazardous materials incidents; natural disasters; and major accidents. The emergency
              management division also coordinates homeland security issues and is the lead U.S.
              representative for international CBRN defense standardization. (For more information, visit <
              http://www.afcesa.af.mil>.)
             Air Force Medical Service. The Air Force Medical Service has robust home station medical-
              response capabilities in support of the installation mission during a CBRN event. Capabilities
              include equipment and personnel for CBRN hazard surveillance/health risk assessment, patient
              decontamination, casualty prevention/management, and quick identification of endemic
              disease/biological agents.
             Air Force Technical Applications Center. The Air Force Technical Applications Center is the
              sole DOD agency operating and maintaining a global network of nuclear-event integrated
              detection networks. This global network is the U.S. Atomic Energy Detection System. Once the
              U.S. Atomic Energy Detection System senses a disturbing event underground, underwater, in
              space, or in the atmosphere, the Air Force Technical Applications Center experts analyze the
              event for nuclear identification and report findings to the national command authorities through
              Headquarters, USAF.
             Air Force Nuclear Weapons and Counterproliferation Agency. The Air Force Nuclear
              Weapons and Counterproliferation Agency provides the warfighter with CBRN science and
              technology to ensure effective nuclear stockpile stewardship and operational and technical
              options for combating WMD threats. The Air Force Nuclear Weapons and Counterproliferation
              Agency supports air staff customers and stakeholder agencies in the national capital region on
              matters concerning stockpiled systems and combating WMD technologies.
             Air Force Weather Agency. The Air Force Weather Agency designates specific units to notify
              specific installations of severe weather patterns affecting installations. The Air Force Weather
              Agency ensures that—
                  Installation weather squadrons can provide weather data for CBRN material dispersion
                   models, including TIM assessments.
                  Operational weather squadrons provide meteorological information necessary to produce
                   chemical downwind messages and effective downwind messages for radiological fallout.
             Air Force Research Laboratory. The Air Force Research Laboratory, Human Effectiveness
              Directorate, Biosciences and Protection Division, Counterproliferation Branch, CB Defense
              Office, acts as a USAF science and technology advisor to the USAF counter-CBRN education,
              training, and exercise working group.
             Air Force Institute for Operational Health. The Air Force Institute for Operational Health

                readiness/mission effectiveness. The Air Force Institute for Operational Health
                develops/implements creative solutions to operational health problems through
                health/environmental surveillance, risk analysis, process reengineering, consultation, and
                technological innovations. It also provides CBRN consultation/health risk assessment, lab
                services, and comprehensive disease surveillance.

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
REPORTING
      J-6. To prepare for, respond to, recover from and, when possible, mitigate the effects of contamination on
      USAF operations, detailed notification procedures are established. These procedures ensure that the
      national command authorities of the United States and/or HN send and receive timely and accurate
      decisionmaking CBRN weapons information.
      J-7. At the installation level, the highest level of command resides in the installation control center, from
      which air operations are planned and executed by the commander’s senior staff. (See figure J-1 for the
      USAF national CBRN reporting chain of command.) CBRNE support operations (personnel survivability
      and mission continuation, response, recovery, mitigation) are controlled from the installation EOC.
      CBRNE C2 tasks reside within the installation EOC and, more specifically, the majority of those tasks are
      executed through the CBRNE control center located physically within or virtually connected to the EOC.

   J-8. The installation CBRNE control center, also known as the CBRN cell, should not be confused with
   the NATO definition of CBRN control center, which is the highest level of CBRN C2 during NATO-led
   operations. Additionally, the installation CBRNE control center is staffed with CBRN specialist personnel
   as a primary duty. Their tasks include CBRN warning, reporting, plotting, evaluation, analysis,
   communications, notification, and other associated execution tasks.
   J-9. Each CBRNE C2 center at every level of command is responsible for reporting CBRN events to the
   next higher level of command. The following defines the scope of the various levels of CBRNE C2 within
   the USAF.

SOURCE LEVEL
   J-10. This is the first level in the CBRN defense system and is best defined as being the individual warrior
   Airman. This includes those Airmen manning observation posts and sites, reconnaissance teams, detection
   teams, and postattack reconnaissance teams. These source level Airmen may or may not be CBRN
   specialist personnel, but have been fully trained to report indications of a CBRNE incident to their
   respective functional C2 formation in their unit control center. The unit control center then reports
   collective findings directly to the installation EOC and/or CBRNE control center. Airmen at the source
   level accomplish the following tasks:
             Report the initial enemy use of CBRN weapons, devices, or agents by the most expeditious
              means available.
             Immediately report further CBRN attacks and subsequent data to their respective unit control
              center.
             Receive notification and timely warning of predicted hazard areas to enable forces to increase
              their CBRN state of readiness; to conduct monitoring; and to prepare for reconnaissance, survey,
              and decontamination.
             Report monitoring and reconnaissance survey results to the respective unit control center.
             Submit detailed information on CBRN incidents within their capability.

INSTALLATION CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR CONTROL
CENTER
   J-11. These C2 centers function at air division headquarters, sector operation centers, or main operating air
   bases for task force commanders. CBRNE control centers (or NATO Subcollection Centers) receive reports
   from many source level Airmen and have personnel to execute the following tasks:
             Advise installation leadership on CBRNE defense.
             Report the initial enemy use of CBRN weapons, devices, or agents by the most expeditious
              means available.
             Clarify, consolidate, and evaluate CBRN attack data reported from the source level or other
              CBRN centers or agencies.
             Compute detailed fallout predictions and detailed chemical downwind hazard areas (where
              possible) based on processed CBRN attack data, and send the appropriate warnings to units
              likely to be affected.
             Direct survey efforts within its zone of observation.
             Analyze survey and monitoring results, and identify the actual contaminated areas to units likely
              to be affected.
             Request and provide detailed information on CBRNE incidents.
             Exchange CBRN information with appropriate national military and civilian authorities as
              arranged by directives and SOPs.

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR COLLECTION CENTER
   J-12. These C2 centers function at numbered USAF headquarters, air operation centers and, occasionally,
   at main operating air bases to support task force commanders. CBRN collection centers generally receive



28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                                J-5
Appendix J



      reports from multiple CBRNE control centers (or NATO subcollection centers) and have personnel to
      execute the following tasks:
                Report the initial enemy use of CBRN weapons by the most expeditious means available
                 according to directives and SOPs.
                Clarify, correlate, consolidate, and evaluate CBRN attack data reported from other CBRN
                 centers or agencies.
                Promptly transmit CBRN warnings to adjacent headquarters or agencies when predicted hazard
                 areas extend beyond their own area of observation.
                Exchange CBRN information with appropriate national military and civilian authorities as
                 arranged by directives and SOPs.
                Organize and coordinate the CBRN warning and reporting system within its area of observation
                 by contributing to the war plans (contingency plans), and issue a comprehensive directive and/or
                 SOP.
                Submit reports to higher headquarters and adjacent agencies as required.

THEATER CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR CELL
      J-13. These C2 centers function at USAF major command headquarters and, occasionally, at theater air
      operations centers to support JTF commanders. Theater CBRN cells generally receive reports from
      multiple CBRNE collection centers and have personnel to execute the following tasks:
               Report the initial enemy use of CBRN weapons by the most expeditious means available
                according to directives and SOPs.
               Clarify, correlate, consolidate, and evaluate CBRN attack data reported from other CBRN
                centers or agencies.
               Promptly transmit CBRN warnings to adjacent headquarters or agencies when predicted hazard
                areas extend beyond their own area of observation.
               Exchange CBRN information with appropriate national military and civilian authorities as
                arranged by directives and SOPs.
               Organize and coordinate the CBRN warning and reporting system within its area of observation
                by contributing to the war plans (contingency plans), and issue a comprehensive directive and/or
                SOP.
               Submit reports to higher headquarters and adjacent agencies as required.
      J-14. Additional CBRN capabilities and assets that are directly tied to the principles of CBRN defense
      (contamination avoidance, CBRN protection, and decontamination) are found in various CBRN-related,
      multi-Service doctrinal publications as indicated in the references section.

           Nuclear Capabilities and Employment
       This appendix provides an overview of the USMC organizational capabilities that
       conduct CBRN operations in support of Marine commanders and doctrinal
       employment at the tactical level. It provides the organizational structure, doctrinal
       mission and corresponding mission sets, tactical employment, organizational
       capabilities, organizational dependencies, and basis of allocation for CBRN staffs and
       units from the battalion to Marine expeditionary force level in support of the Marine
       air-ground task force (MAGTF).

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
OPERATIONAL CONCEPT
   K-1. The USMC operating forces are unique. The USMC, as part of national maritime forces, provide
   expeditionary forces to project combat power ashore in support of naval campaigns or in conjunction with
   USA and USAF units. The USMC is designed to provide sea-based, self-sustained power projection and
   forcible entry ashore and nontraditional missions (noncombatant evacuation operations, security operations,
   tactical recovery of aircraft personnel, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief). These forces provide a swift
   and effective means of responding to fast-breaking crises and can remain on station for indefinite periods of
   time, ready to intervene or take action if needed.
   K-2. MAGTF CBRN operations and capabilities currently fall into one of four joint CBRN functional
   concept categories: CBRN shape, CBRN sense, CBRN shield, and CBRN sustain. The USMC focuses
   these concepts to allow commanders to make decisions quickly and heavily relies on proper staff education
   and coordination to operate in a CBRN environment. MAGTF operations in a CBRN environment will
   focus on operational risk management-guided decisions that allow the MAGTF commander to minimize
   the operational impact of CBRN effects. This concept provides the foundation for emerging support to the
   MAGTF commander regarding the eight military mission areas outlined in the National Military Strategy
   for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction. The future operational concept is to conduct CBRN
   operations in support of combating WMD and the protection warfighting function by employing task-
   organized CBRN forces and specialized CBRN elements or teams, task-organized to an appropriate CBRN
   or other C2 headquarters.
   K-3. The MAGTF CBRN organization maintains two distinct categories to support the MAGTF with
   CBRN capabilities—CBRN units and CBRN staffs. (See figure K-1, page K-2, for the categories and
   representative organizations within them.)

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR UNITS
      K-4. MAGTF CBRN support units fall into two broad categories: operational and technical. Operational
      CBRN units include CBRN platoons—at the MSC level (division), Marine aircraft wing, and Marine
      logistics group—and teams within the MSC that support the Marine expeditionary. Technical CBRN units
      include technical escort support coupled with the MAGTF consequence set.

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR STAFFS
      K-5. The MAGTF CBRN staffs support the USMC modular force design by incorporating a combination
      of CBRN officers and CBRN specialists at the detachment (combat service support detachment),
      battalion/squadron, regiment/Marine aircraft group/Marine wing support group, Marine expeditionary unit,
      Marine expeditionary brigade, and division, Marine logistics group, Marine aircraft wing, and Marine
      expeditionary force echelons at the command element and CBRN-trained augments at the
      company/squadron level.

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
UNITS
   K-6. CBRN operational units include chemical and biological incident response force (CBIRF), CBRN
   platoons (division, Marine aircraft wing, and Marine logistics group), and CBRN teams. They represent the
   largest number of CBRN organizational capability in the USMC. Besides CBIRF, the platoon is the basic
   general-purpose unit of employment. CBRN platoons are task-organized to support the MAGTF
   commander (CBRN reconnaissance or decontamination platoons). Each Marine expeditionary force

CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL INCIDENT RESPONSE FORCE
   K-7. CBIRF was created in 1996 to fill a need that was lacking in the national ability to respond to a
   terrorist attack or WMD incident. Prior to unit activation, the federal government did not have a coherent
   response capability for a CBRNE event that could holistically provide detection, identification, extraction,
   mass decontamination, and medical triage.
   K-8. CBIRF is a battalion-size unit of nearly 500 Marines and Seamen comprised of more than two dozen
   MOSs and capable of performing a broad range of consequence tasks. Due to the nature of the WMD
   threat, CBIRF has to be prepared 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to respond to a sudden attack or incident.
   CBIRF maintains a standing operational task-organized force, known as the initial response force (IRF).
   The IRF is a task-organized, trained, standing reaction force comprised of approximately 131 CBIRF
   personnel. It is manned and equipped to provide the full range of incident response capabilities for
   contaminated-environment operations, to include C2, agent detection and identification, casualty
   extraction, extrication, emergency medical care and stabilization, limited EOD capability, response force
   and casualty decontamination, and internal organic FP. This force is logistically self-sustaining and
   prepared to integrate into the civilian Incident/Unified Command System or as part of a DOD JTF. Upon
   deployment of the first incident response force, CBIRF will immediately stand up its second incident
   response force. Within 6 hours, this force will be ready to act as a follow-on-force for the first incident
   response force or as an independent response force for another incident.
   K-9. The II Marine Expeditionary Force is the operational Marine expeditionary force under Marine
   Forces Command. It retains operational control of CBIRF with requests for forces going through Marine
   forces command and to II Marine Expeditionary Force for commitment of CBIRF personnel. Requests for
   forces flow to the President of the United States or Secretary of Defense through the Joint Forces
   Command (JFCOM). Approved requests for CBIRF participation are assigned by JFCOM to Marine forces

      Additionally, CBIRF is often tasked to pre-position forces in support of specific national special security
      events designated by the U.S. Secret Service. Although it is generally believed that CBIRF directly
      supports the JTF national capital region, CBIRF may be (and has been) tasked to support missions within
      CONUS outside of the national capital region and OCONUS. (See table K-1 for CBIRF tactical data.)
                                       Table K-1. CBIRF tactical data

MISSION
      K-10. The CBIRF mission statement reads, “When directed, forward deploy and/or respond to a credible
      threat of a CBRNE incident to assist local, state, or federal agencies and unified combat commanders in the
      conduct of consequence operations. CBIRF accomplishes this mission by providing capabilities for agent
      detection and identification; casualty search, rescue, and personnel decontamination; and emergency
      medical care and stabilization of contaminated personnel.”
      K-11. CBIRF assists local, state, or federal agencies and designated CCDRs in the conduct of consequence
      operations. It provides key capabilities, including agent detection and identification; casualty search,
      rescue, and personnel decontamination; emergency medical care; and the stabilization of contaminated
      personnel. CBIRF ability to assist civil authorities is enhanced by its adherence to the applicable federal


K-4                       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1               28 February 2011
        U.S. Marine Corps Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Capabilities and Employment



   regulations regarding hazardous materials response and its inventory of National Institute for Occupational
   Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified response equipment. CBIRF is structured for domestic and foreign
   consequence operations and remains on a one-hour alert to respond to contingency. Operationally, CBIRF
   is capable of deploying up to 330 personnel, task-organized to provide detection and identification of
   120,000 toxic industrial chemicals; known chemical-warfare agents; eight biological agents; and alpha,
   beta, gamma, neutron, and X-ray emissions.
   K-12. The CBIRF, on its own or in conjunction with other DOD assets (National Guard [NG] WMD civil
   support teams, CBRNE-enhanced response force package, USCG strike teams) will detect and identify
   CBRN agents/substances, assess the potential effects of the WMD incident, advise the local authorities on
   managing the effects of the attack, and assist with appropriate requests for additional support to minimize
   the impact on the civilian population.
   K-13. The CBIRF has the ability to locate and extract victims from a contaminated environment, perform
   medical triage and treatment in contaminated environments, and perform mass patient/casualty
   decontamination to support civil first responders or military authorities. In a general tiered-response
   scenario, WMD civil support team, NG CBRNE-enhanced response force package, and CBIRF capabilities
   would be complementary and completely interoperable with civilian responders according to the National
   Incident Management System using the incident command system. Identified as a “dual purpose” unit
   because of its worldwide deployment status, CBIRF is also capable of deploying in support of a foreign
   consequence incident, enabling it to augment a joint force commander, Department of State officials, or
   other U.S. or non-U.S. agencies as directed. To accomplish these tasks, CBIRF personnel receive
   specialized training in hazardous materials operations, personal protective equipment, and additional
   training in the technical aspects of performing their regular and specialized duties in hazardous
   environments.
   K-14. Since its establishment in April 1996, CBIRF has operationally deployed in support of multiple
   national special security events, including the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, presidential inauguration ceremonies
   in 1996 and 2000, presidential State of the Union addresses, the 1999 papal visit, the 1999 NATO summit,
   and the Y2K (year 2000) celebration. During Operation Noble Eagle, CBIRF supported response
   operations at the U.S. Capitol by collecting more than 600 biological samples and removing and screening
   12 tons of congressional mail and office equipment. CBIRF and its mobile training teams have also
   deployed overseas in support of multiple exercises in Jordan, Bahrain, Iceland, Qatar, Kuwait, Italy,
   France, the Philippines, and Japan.
   K-15. CBIRF is a USN-USMC team that is tasked with executing a challenging mission to meet an
   emerging threat. It is most effective when forward-deployed in support of a CCDR or designated lead
   federal agency.

CAPABILITIES
   K-16. The CBIRF includes a complete WMD consequence response package and remains the only single-
   source, DOD unit that is capable of providing C2 and supporting elements required for a CBRN

MAJOR SUBORDINATE COMMAND DECONTAMINATION TEAMS
   K-26. Each MSC has a decontamination team (comprised of CBRN defense specialists) that is task-
   organized as required to support MAGTF operations. The team organization is based on providing one
   decontamination section for each MSC element, regiment, or Marine aircraft group and five for each
   Marine logistics group. Each section is staffed with one section leader and three section members for a total
   of four personnel. Teams will be task-organized to perform operational decontamination missions based on
   mission requirements and the commander’s priorities. (See table K-4 for information on how the teams are
   organized within the operating force.) (See table K-5 for the team billets, rank, and training requirements.)
   CBRNCC operations coordinator will direct task organization and employment and coordinate the support
   for the team. The actual concept of employment will be initially based on the vulnerability analysis and
   adjusted as required in response to a CBRN incident. Each operational decontamination section is trained
   and equipped to support casualty decontamination, MOPP drop, MOPP gear exchange, and vehicle/aircraft
   washdown.

MARINE AIR-GROUND TASK FORCE CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL,
RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR SUPPORT
   K-27. The USMC has approximately 110 CBRN defense officers and 800 CBRN defense specialists on
   active duty, spread across its force and assigned at the detachment, battalion, or squadron level and higher.
   The active duty, component can be augmented by the USMC reserve forces. Reserve forces have
   approximately 32 CBRN defense officers and 200 CBRN defense specialist, spread throughout the nation.
   If required, this force can integrate seamlessly with the active duty MAGTF. The size and composition of a
   MAGTF and a CBRN unit depend on METT-T. To conduct CBRN operations effectively, the force
   requires a clear understanding of the mission, command relationships, and available resources. Since the
   USMC has a limited number of MOS-qualified CBRN specialists (MOS 5702 and MOS 5711), these
   specialists are placed where they will have the greatest impact on overall mission accomplishment. This
   means that positions on CBRN reconnaissance and decontamination teams will be augmented with non-
   CBRN defense specialists to assist CBRN specialists with their duties. Based on this information, the
   MAGTF commander considers the following when conducting operations:
              CBRN personnel and equipment organic to the units assigned to, or under the operational control
               of, the MAGTF.
              Availability of CBRN specialists (MOS 5702 and MOS 5711) and collateral duty CBRN-trained
               augments (reconnaissance/decontamination).
              Additional CBRN equipment and personnel available from other agencies (Services, JTF).
              MAGTF command and support relationships.
   K-28. Echelons of command must supervise and reinforce the CBRN efforts of subordinate elements. Each
   commander in a MAGTF must prepare and implement CBRN measures while also ensuring that their
   subordinates can operate in a CBRN environment. Units must be capable of performing the following
   essential operations:
             Detecting and identifying CBRN agents and materials.
             Warning of and reporting CBRN attacks and hazards.
             Performing individual- and collective-protection measures.
             Decontaminating personnel, equipment, and terrain as required.
             Administering first aid and following unit medical operations and exposure guidance.
   K-29. Regardless of the unit size or the mission, principles essential to CBRN remain constant—only the
   scope will vary. The following principles help determine the structure of effective CBRN teams and units:
             Lowest level of organization required to function as an independent unit must possess the
              capability to survive and accomplish specialized tasks in a CBRN environment.
             Higher units or formations must also be capable of accomplishing their own mission and
              supporting subordinate units if required.
             Specific personnel must be designated and trained for specific CBRN responsibilities.

COMMAND ELEMENT
   K-30. The     command      element     coordinates    reconnaissance/survey   operations,     coordinates
   surveillance/monitoring operations, and coordinates and monitors decontamination operations. It maintains
   close coordination with intelligence assets to exchange CBRN reconnaissance/survey intelligence. The
   command element is also responsible for collecting, collating, analyzing, and disseminating
   surveillance/monitoring information. Headquarters and service unit CBRN teams conduct CBRN

Appendix K



   operations for the command element. Many different units on the battlefield will be in a position to report
   CBRN activity; therefore, the command element must be prepared to establish a CBRNCC that is capable
   of continuous operations.

GROUND COMBAT ELEMENT
   K-31. The ground combat element company and battalion teams organize as elements of their respective
   units. Since the threat of a CBRN attack is equal to ground combat units, the ground combat element
   commander normally leaves CBRN assets with the parent organization. The Marine division CBRN
   platoon is placed in a general support or direct support role based on the CBRN threat and the ability to
   facilitate future operations. If augmentation is required, the officer in charge of the ground combat element
   CBRNCC coordinates with the officer in charge of the Marine expeditionary force CBRNCC.
   Augmentation provided is based on assets available and operational priorities.

Marine Division
   K-32. The division operations section (G-3) contains the CBRN platoon. Personnel required to staff a
   CBRNCC are drawn from this section. In addition to performing control center functions at the division
   level, CBRN personnel supervise overall CBRN operations planning, organization, and readiness of
   subordinate units. This section can also perform other CBRN duties (reconnaissance, decontamination with
   equipment from the supported unit). The division CBRN officer advises the commander and coordinates
   CBRN efforts.

Regiment
   K-33. The regiment CBRN needs are met with as little rearrangement of existing personnel and equipment
   as possible. The regimental commander assigns the CBRN officer as the officer in charge and task-
   organizes organic assets. If additional assistance is required, the regimental commander requests
   reinforcement from higher headquarters. Regiments are normally staffed with a CBRN officer (MOS 5702)
   to assist the commander and staff in CBRN operations. Normally, one CBRN NCO and one CBRN
   specialist (MOS 5711) are assigned to assist the CBRN officer. Other Marines may be assigned the
   responsibilities of CBRN NCOs as additional duties. The regiment CBRN officer advises the commander
   and coordinates CBRN efforts.

Battalions
   K-34. Unit CBRN needs are met with as little rearrangement of existing personnel and equipment as
   possible. Battalions are normally staffed with a CBRN officer (MOS 5702) to assist the commander and
   staff in CBRN operations. Normally, one CBRN NCO and one CBRN specialist (MOS 5711) are assigned
   to assist the CBRN officer. Other Marines may be assigned the responsibilities of CBRN augmentees
   (reconnaissance and decontamination team noncommissioned officers in charge [NCOICs] and members).
   The battalion CBRN officer advises the commander and coordinates CBRN efforts.

Companies
   K-35. Company commanders organize and train CBRN teams and other CBRN personnel according to unit
   SOPs and directives issued from higher headquarters. During actual CBRN operations, CBRN-trained
   personnel can be assigned to full-time CBRN duties. Although CBRN specialists are not located at all
   levels, companies are still required to conduct individual and unit training according to Marine Corps Order
   (MCO) 3400.3F.

        U.S. Marine Corps Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Capabilities and Employment



GROUND COMBAT ELEMENT CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
CONTROL CENTER
   K-36. The ground combat element CBRNCC collects, evaluates, and collates, information concerning
   friendly and enemy CBRN operations to the commander; his/her staff; and higher, adjacent, and supporting
   units. Specifically, the ground combat element CBRNCC—
             Plans the employment of CBRN detectors and sensors.
             Disseminates tasks of the CBRN reconnaissance and decontamination teams.
             Disseminates overall unit CBRN guidance.
             Performs the computations needed to convert basic CBRN information into the required form.
             Evaluates, plots, displays and disseminates CBRN information.
   K-37. Each command has an organized and trained CBRNCC team. The CBRNCC is normally located
   within the combat operations center. This facilitates close coordination with other elements/sections (the
   operations section, intelligence section, fire support coordination center).
   K-38. Commanders and their staffs use the information collected and processed by the ground combat
   element CBRNCC team to assist them in their decisionmaking process.

AVIATION COMBAT ELEMENT
   K-39. The current structure of the Marine aircraft wing includes the CBRN officers and specialists (MOS
   5702 and 5711) that are required to sustain foreseeable CBRN operations. Additional support is requested
   through the command element CBRNCC.

Marine Aircraft Wing Headquarters
   K-40. The Marine aircraft wing G-3 contains the CBRN personnel required to staff an aviation combat
   element Marine air-ground task force (ACE) CBRNCC. This center is normally located in the tactical air
   command center. These personnel perform overall CBRN planning, organization, and readiness for their
   units. The organization of CBRN officers and specialists assigned to various units ensure that there is a
   coordinated effort to accomplish CBRN missions.

Marine Aircraft Group
   K-41. The MAG CBRN section consists of one CBRN officer (MOS 5702) and several CBRN specialists
   (MOS 5711). The Marine aircraft group is the lowest Marine aircraft wing level with a CBRN specialist
   (with the exception of the Marine wing support squadron). When attached to subordinate units, Marine
   aircraft group CBRN personnel provide guidance on CBRN matters and coordinate with the Marine
   support squadron concerning aspects of immediate and operational decontamination, contamination
   control, and CBRN reconnaissance.

Squadron/Battalion
   K-42. Squadron/battalion CBRN officers and CBRN specialists are normally consolidated at the Marine
   aircraft group level (except for the Marine wing support squadron). This allows the centralized control of
   equipment maintenance, CBRN warning and reporting, and CBRN training. Although CBRN specialists
   are not located at all levels, squads are still required to conduct individual and unit training according to
   MCO 3400.3F.

Marine Wing Support Squadron
   K-43. The Marine wing support squadron CBRN section has a decontamination station supervisor for each
   type of detailed decontamination. It also has a contamination control supervisor and a CBRNCC that may
   be attached to the ACE. It may be necessary to obtain augmentation from the other squadrons within the
   group to fully staff the control center.

Appendix K



Aviation Combat Element Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Control Center
Team
   K-44. Although Marine aircraft wing squadrons are not required to establish an ACE CBRN control center
   team, they must be prepared to submit NBC 1 and 4 reports to higher headquarters. The ACE CBRNCC
   collects, evaluates, and collates information concerning friendly and enemy CBRN operations and then
   disseminates the information to the commander; his/her staff; and higher, adjacent, and supporting units.
   Specifically, the ACE CBRNCC—
             Plans the employment of CBRN detectors and sensors.
             Disseminates tasks to the CBRN reconnaissance and decontamination teams.
             Disseminates overall unit CBRN guidance.
             Performs the computations needed to convert basic CBRN information into the required form.
             Evaluates, plots, displays, and disseminates CBRN information.

LOGISTICS COMMAND ELEMENT
   K-45. Logistics command element battalions possess the equipment and personnel required to perform
   CBRN operations. The CBRN decontamination unit is organized and attached to the logistics command
   element based on the CBRN threat.

Marine Logistics Group
   K-46. The Marine logistics group G-3 contains a CBRN platoon that consists of CBRN officers and CBRN
   specialists. Elements of this platoon are used to—
              Form the logistics command element CBRNCC.
              Coordinate, evaluate and, if necessary, augment CBRN operations conducted within the Marine
               logistics group AO.
              Provide the nucleus of a reinforced platoon or provisional unit to support MAGTF operations
               with thorough decontamination and reconnaissance support as directed by the MAGTF
               command element.

Regiment
   K-47. Regiment CBRN needs are met with as little rearrangement of existing personnel and equipment as
   possible. The regimental commander assigns the CBRN officer as the officer in charge and task-organizes
   organic assets. If additional assistance is required, the regimental commander requests reinforcement from
   higher headquarters. Regiments are normally staffed with a CBRN senior NCO (MOS 5711) to assist the
   commander and staff in CBRN operations. Normally, one CBRN NCO and one CBRN specialist (MOS
   5711) are assigned to assist the CBRN senior NCO. Other Marines may be assigned the responsibilities of
   CBRN NCOs as additional duties. The regiment CBRN senior NCO advises the commander and
   coordinates CBRN efforts.

Battalions
   K-48. Unit CBRN needs are met with as little rearrangement of existing personnel and equipment as
   possible. Battalions are normally staffed with a CBRN NCO (MOS 5711) to assist the commander and staff
   in CBRN operations. Normally, one CBRN specialist (MOS 5711) is assigned to assist the CBRN NCO.
   Other Marines may be assigned the responsibilities of CBRN augmentees (reconnaissance and
   decontamination team NCOICs and members). The battalion CBRN officer advises the commander and
   coordinates CBRN efforts.

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR SPECIALIST
   K-53. CBRN specialist billets are incorporated into the USMC table of organization (listed as CBRN
   NCOs) commands down to the battalion level. The CBRN specialist, like the CBRN officer, is a member of
   the operations section. The specialist maintains unit CBRN equipment, trains Marines in CBRN measures
   and protection, and advises the unit CBRN officer on CBRN matters. Specific training standards are listed
   in MCO 3500.70. The duties of the CBRN specialist vary with the level of command. The CBRN specialist
   should be prepared to assist the CBRN officer. CBRN specialists—
             Assist the CBRN officer in the execution of his/her duties.
             Assist the CBRN officer in ensuring that CBRN SOPs are up-to-date and effectively
              promulgated.
             Execute and monitor the joint equipment assessment unit plan.
             Maintain CBRN publications.
             Recommend unit CBRN training requirements.

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR CONTROL CENTER
   K-54. The CBRNCC monitors and coordinates CBRN operations. It is also responsible for collecting,
   collating, analyzing, and disseminating CBRN-related information. CBRN information may come from
   many different agencies or units. As a general rule, CBRN information gathering focuses on early warning
   of CBRN attacks, locations of contaminated areas, decontamination sites, and routes from contaminated
   areas to decontamination sites. The CBRNCC provides the commander with information that supports
   rapid decisionmaking. This ensures that the commander is able to maintain his/her desired operating tempo,
   while emphasizing to the enemy commander that CBRN employment is ineffective against U.S. forces. The
   CBRNCC monitors and coordinates CBRN operations and is the hub for CBRN battle management within
   the MAGTF. (See figure K-6 for a depiction of how the CBRNCC forms the hub for CBRN operations.)

Officer in Charge
   K-56. The CBRNCC officer in charge is a special staff officer who supervises the overall operation of the
   CBRNCC. The duties include the following:
            Coordinate CBRN-related issues that involve or impact other staff sections. This coordination
             requires direct lines of communication to the medical, logistics, intelligence, personnel, and
             other staff sections.
            Supervise the operations coordinator. CBRN operations must be reviewed by the officer in
             charge and approved by the appropriate watch officer prior to execution.
            Supervise the JWARN operator. The MAGTF CBRNCC is the only CBRNCC within the
             MAGTF that can assign a strike serial number to a NBC report. The officer in charge must
             approve strike serial number assignments.
            Approve reports and overlays before they are posted or disseminated.
            Represent the CBRNCC by participating in staff briefings.
            Be capable of assuming any position within the CBRNCC.

   K-57. The CBRNCC operations coordinator coordinates CBRN operations within the MAGTF. The duties
   include the following:
             Prepare a localized, overall CBRN vulnerability analysis for the MAGTF.
             Recommend the MOPP level for the MAGTF command element. Subordinate commands will
              establish their own MOPP level based on their vulnerability analysis and higher headquarters
              guidance or direction.
             Develop, implement, support, and supervise the MAGTF surveillance and monitoring plan.
             Develop, implement, support, and supervise the MAGTF CBRN reconnaissance missions.
             Collect and analyze surveillance, monitoring, and reconnaissance data; and prepare the
              appropriate NBC reports and overlays.
             Monitor subordinate commands’ radiological exposure status and compile the MAGTF overall
              radiological exposure status. The recording and collection of individual exposure is a medical
              responsibility.
             Forward NBC reports and overlays to the JWARN operator, if necessary.
             Develop, implement, support, and supervise the MAGTF decontamination plan.
             Be capable of assuming any position within the CBRNCC.

Appendix K



Joint Warning and Reporting Center Operator
   K-58. The JWARN operator must be able to receive and import reports and overlays directly into the C4I
   network. The duties include the following:
            Process chemical downwind messages and effective downwind messages as necessary to support
             the MAGTF AO.
            Collect, collate, and analyze CBRN information received from higher, adjacent, and subordinate
             CBRNCCs.
            Prepare and disseminate NBC reports, overlays, and information received from higher, adjacent,
             and subordinate CBRNCCs.
            Disseminate NBC reports, overlays, and information received from higher, adjacent, and
             subordinate CBRNCCs via C4I network.

MAJOR SUBORDINATE COMMAND
   K-59. The ground combat element, ACE, and logistics combat element CBRNCCs coordinate CBRN
   operations within their command. The CBRNCC is resident within the G-3, and current operations section
   and requires a minimum of six personnel. The CBRNCC is capable of continuous operations. It maintains
   close coordination with intelligence assets to exchange CBRN reconnaissance, surveillance, and monitoring
   intelligence. The headquarters unit is responsible for conducting the CBRN operations necessary to support
   itself and the command element. Unit NBC reports will go directly to the CBRNCC. The MSC CBRNCC
   members’ duties are the same as the MAGTF CBRNCC at the MSC level. (See table K-8 for the MSC

SUBORDINATE COMMAND
   K-60. Battalions, regiments, groups, and other designated units are staffed with one or more CBRN defense
   personnel (CBRN section) who coordinate CBRN operations within their command. The CBRN section is
   resident within the operations and training officer (S-3), and the total number of personnel varies depending
   on the type of unit. CBRN sections with two or more personnel assigned are capable of continuous
   operations. Subordinate commands must be able to communicate with the higher headquarters CBRNCC
   and are responsible for coordinating and/or conducting the CBRN operations necessary to support the
   command. The following is a description of CBRN section duties:
             Coordinate CBRN-related issues that involve or impact other staff sections and subordinate
              elements.
             Participate in staff briefings.
             Coordinate CBRN operations within the command.
             Coordinate support for those CBRN operations that are beyond the command’s capability
              through the higher headquarters CBRNCC.
             Prepare the unit CBRN vulnerability analysis.
             Recommend the unit MOPP level. Subordinate companies and squadrons may need to be
              separately assessed; one MOPP level may not be appropriate for the entire unit.
             Develop, implement, support, and supervise the unit surveillance and monitoring plan.
             Ensure that unit staff and subordinate commands are aware of higher headquarters CBRNCC
              CBRN reconnaissance missions being conducted in the area.
             Collect surveillance and monitoring data, and prepare and forward the appropriate NBC reports
              to the higher headquarters CBRNCC.
             Receive and analyze NBC reports from the CBRNCC, and advise the staff on actions required to
              avoid or mitigate CBRN contamination.
             Compile the unit radiological exposure status, and forward it to the CBRNCC. The recording of
              individual exposure is a medical responsibility.
             Review the CBRNCC decontamination plan to ensure that it provides adequate support for the
              unit.
             Operate JWARN. Units staffed with the CBRN defense personnel (MOS 5702 and 5711) must
              be prepared to operate JWARN. JWARN use is dependent on the operational scenario. In those
              instances when the CBRN defense personnel are not able to operate JWARN, they must be able
              to manually produce, receive, plot, and record NBC reports.
   K-61. The Joint NBC Reconnaissance System, subordinate command reconnaissance, and CBRN
   decontamination teams are task-organized and employed as necessary to support the MAGTF. They may be
   attached and report directly to a battalion, regiment, or group. The MAGTF CBRNCC will maintain an
   overall SA of how the NBC Reconnaissance System and decontamination teams are being employed and
   may take operational control of these assets when required. The operational scenario will dictate the means
   of communication used by the units, CBRN sections, and CBRNCCs to pass on NBC reports and overlays
   and communicate with CBRN teams. (See figures K-7 through K-9, pages K-22 through K-24, for more
   information on how the CBRNCC and reconnaissance and decontamination teams are coordinated
   throughout the Marine expeditionary force to support the MAGTF.)

         Note. Marine Corps Warfighting Publication (MCWP) 3-37 provides a complete description of
         how the USMC plans and executes CBRN defense operations.

 U.S. Navy Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear
              Capabilities and Employment
       This appendix provides a brief summary of the duties of key individuals on USN
       shipboard, aviation, and shore-based staffs with assigned CBRN defense
       responsibilities. This appendix also provides an overview of the capabilities that the
       USN has forward-deployed and readily available in-theater for use by the
       commander. Finally, this appendix presents a summary of the organization and
       functions of shore-based USN EOCs that facilitate the immediate response of
       appropriate USN specialists to CBRN incidents. (See appendix H for relevant USN
       reachback capabilities.)

CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR
ORGANIZATIONS
    L-1. Unlike the other Services, the USN has not developed unique career paths and associated cadres of
         dedicated CBRN defense specialists whose sole function is to advise and provide CBRN defense to
         USN operations. Alternatively, the USN uses the talent and expertise of its shipboard damage control
         specialists and its shore-based, all-hazard emergency responders to help maintain CBRN defense
         readiness. USN CBRN defense duties are assigned as an additional duty to individuals or already-
         established teams of personnel within its shipboard, aviation, and shore-based communities. CBRN
         defense resources are provided primarily by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Naval Air Systems
         Command, and Naval Facilities Engineering Command and are coordinated through unified
         commands.

SHIPBOARD UNITS
    L-2. Aboard USN ships, the damage control assistant under the engineer officer is responsible for ship
         survivability systems, to include the control of damage, control of stability, list, trim, fighting fires,
         restoration from damages, and CBRN defense measures. He/she trains and supervises the ship
         damage control teams in emergency response for combating hazardous materials and hazardous
         wastes. He/she is responsible for all-hands CBRN defense training. The shipboard damage control
         section, known as the “R” division and working under the damage control assistant, is composed of
         full-time damage control personnel and personnel from other divisions whose damage control
         responsibilities are limited. All have received baseline training in CB defense, and some have
         received much more extensive training in CB defense and become certified as shipboard instructors.
         These more qualified individuals are known as shipboard CBR defense operations and training
         specialists and senior enlisted damage control program management and training specialists. This
         organization, working out of its damage control center, advises the command on CBRN
         defense-related issues. Additional details concerning the CBRN defense planning and execution
         considerations carried out by shipboard damage control sections are listed within the CBRN chapters
         of Navy Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (NTTP) 3-20.31. Duties of the damage control assistant
         include—
              Prepare directives to be signed by the commanding officer for CBRN functions requiring
               coordination of departments.
              Submit a schedule of all-hands CBRN training requirements (according to the surface force
               training manual).

Appendix L



              Maintain a damage control training syllabus and provide CBRN instructors for all-hands
               training.
              Train and supervise the ship damage control teams in emergency responses for combating
               hazardous materials/hazardous waste spills.
              Provide training to divisions regarding reporting, initial handling, and cleaning of hazardous
               materials/hazardous waste spills.

AVIATION UNITS
      L-3. In USN aviation units, the squadron commanding officer assigns one individual as the squadron CB
           defense officer to serve as the commanding officer’s action officer for CB defense readiness. While
           on watch, the assigned squadron duty officer serves as the commanding officer’s initial coordinator
           for CB defense.
      L-4. Primary CBRN defense-related duties of the squadron CB defense officer include the following:
              Establish, implement, and periodically review the unit CB defense SOP for contamination
               avoidance, protection, and control.
              Establish decontamination and detection teams from unit personnel and equipment.
              Coordinate requirements for contamination avoidance, detection, and decontamination with unit
               department heads; and determine the host command’s capability to support CB defense
               requirements.
              Establish and maintain unit CB defense training.
              Assist the department head’s efforts to maximize unit CB defense readiness while maintaining
               the ability to meet mission-essential tasking.
              Keep the commanding officer informed of unit CB defense status, and make recommendations
               to improve training and readiness.
      L-5. Primary CBRN defense-related duties of the on-watch squadron duty officer responsibilities include
           the following:
                Notify the commanding officer, executive officer, and key unit personnel of CB threats,
                 warnings, and alarms.
                Take appropriate CB defense actions regarding aircraft, personnel, ready rooms, unit spaces, and
                 shop areas.
                Monitor command CB defense response efforts; and keep the commanding officer, executive
                 officer, and key unit personnel apprised.
                Establish and maintain communications with area, senior, and host commands in monitoring CB
                 threat/attack alarms and warning information.
                Communicate CB defense status to aircraft with CO’s instructions.

SHORE-BASED UNITS
      L-6. This command structure may be modified to meet the requirements and structure of specific regional
           and installation commands. (See figure L-1 for the baseline command structure that the Commander,
           Navy Installation Command has established for the USN installation emergency management
           program.)

            Commander, Naval District Washington.
            Commander, Navy Region Mid-Atlantic.
            Commander, Navy Region Midwest.

            Commander, Navy Region Korea.
            Commander, Navy Region Marianas.
            Commander, Navy Region Southwest Asia.
    L-8. At the USN regional level, the regional emergency management functional manager is assigned
         responsibility for developing, coordinating, and executing the USN installation emergency
         management program within their assigned geographical area. As the senior dedicated emergency
         management official within a region, the regional emergency management provides management
         oversight, technical assistance, and specialized guidance on matters pertaining to the establishment,
         implementation, and sustainment of a comprehensive emergency management program that is capable
         of effective all-hazards preparedness, including CBRNE, prevention/mitigation, response, and
         recovery to save lives, protect property, and sustain mission readiness.

      L-9. USN regions located overseas typically have additional foreign consequence management (FCM)
           responsibilities and additional CBRN defense requirements identified in writing by their supported
           theater CCDR. As a result, some USN regions have been provided with contract CBRNE coordinators
           by the communication, navigation, and identification emergency management program and/or the
           Naval Facilities Engineering Command CBRN program. These contract personnel are fielded to assist
           with designated regional emergency management programs over a specified period of time. They
           address CBRNE-specific hazards within their programs, especially in the preparedness areas of
           planning, training, equipment fielding, inventory management, and limited exercises.
      L-10. At the USN installation level, the installation emergency management officer is assigned
          responsibility for preparing for, responding to, mitigating potential effects from, and recovering from
          natural and man-made hazards, including CBRNE events, which may affect their assigned
          installations. The installation emergency management officer is responsible for the management,
          administration, and operation of the installation EOC and installation dispatch center (if assigned).
          Specific USN installations located overseas may have FCM responsibilities and additional CBRN
          defense requirements identified in writing to their assigned regional commander by their supported
          theater CCDR.
      L-11. As discussed previously, some USN regions require specialized expertise that is provided in the
          form of contract CBRNE coordinators. Where multiple high-priority installations are located within
          close proximity as judged by communication, navigation, and identification emergency management,
          and where at least one of these installations also contains all or a component of the regional
          headquarters, a CBRNE coordinator may be provided to the regional emergency management
          program as the fleet concentration area CBRNE coordinator. In such cases, the fleet concentration
          area CBRNE coordinator will still directly support the regional emergency management program, but
          will be authorized to liaison directly with the appropriate installation emergency management point of
          contact.

NAVY FORWARD-DEPLOYED CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL,
RADIOLOGICAL, AND NUCLEAR DEFENSE SUPPORT ASSETS
      L-12. The following paragraphs provide a summary overview of the capabilities that USN forward
          deploys and makes readily available in theater for use by the commander. (See appendix H for
          additional relevant USN reachback capabilities.)

SUPPORT AFLOAT
      L-13. Medical departments on aircraft carriers; aircraft carriers, nuclear; large-deck amphibious assault
          ships (general purpose); hospital ships; and command ships are equipped to provide confirmatory
          testing capability for environmental samples. They can receive, sample, test, report, package, and
          transport suspected biological warfare samples.

FORWARD-DEPLOYABLE PREVENTIVE MEDICINE UNIT
      L-14. When deployed forward, the primary missions of the forward-deployable preventive medicine unit
          are to provide force health protection by rapidly assessing, preventing, and controlling health threats
          in a theater of operations and to enhance organic preventive medicine assets. A designated forward-
          deployable medicine unit will deploy to provide short-duration, specialized preventive medicine
          support. Its capabilities include the ability to identify and evaluate environmental health hazards
          (including CBR and physical agents), assess the risk of adverse health outcomes, monitor the health
          of deployed forces, and advise the operational commander on significant risks and recommended
          preventive medicine interventions. It can also provide technical assistance and field confirmatory
          analysis for CB agents.

NAVY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTERS
    L-15. The following is a summary of the organization and functions of shore-based USN EOCs that
        serve to facilitate the immediate response of appropriate USN specialists to CBRN incidents ashore:

TYPES
    L-16. Operations centers (regional operations centers, installation EOCs) are the physical locations at
        which the coordination of information and resources to support incident management activities
        normally take place. The following are types of operations centers:
           Incident command post. It is located at or in the immediate vicinity of an incident site.
            Although primarily focused on the tactical on-scene response, an incident command post may
            also perform an operations-center-like function in smaller-scale incidents or during the initial
            phase of the response to larger, more complex events. Incident command posts, when
            established, are linked to the installation EOC and/or the regional operations center to ensure
            effective and efficient incident management.
           Standing operations centers (or those activated to support larger, more complex events).
            They are typically established in a more central or permanently established facility and at a
            higher level of organization within a jurisdiction.
           USN operations centers. They are organized by jurisdiction (combatant command; fleet;
            numbered fleet; communication, navigation, and identification; region; installation; medical
            treatment facility; and tenant command).
           Departmental operations centers. They are normally focused on internal agency incident
            management and response and are linked to and, in most cases, physically represented in a
            higher-level operations center.

STRUCTURE
    L-17. USN operations centers may be permanent organizations and facilities or may be established to
        meet temporary, short-term needs. The physical size, staffing, and equipping of an operations center
        will depend on the size of the jurisdiction, resources available, and anticipated incident management
        workload. Operations centers may be organized and staffed in a variety of ways, but regardless of the
        specific organizational structure used, they will include the following core functions: coordination;
        communications; resource dispatch and tracking; and information collection, analysis, and
        dissemination.

MULTIAGENCY COORDINATION
    L-18. Operations centers may also support multiagency coordination and joint information activities.
        Multiagency coordination entities typically consist of principals (or their designees) from
        organizations and agencies with direct incident management responsibility or with significant incident
        management support or resource responsibilities. These entities are sometimes referred to as crisis
        action teams, policy committees, incident management groups, executive teams, or other similar
        terms. For complex incidents, operation centers will be staffed by personnel representing multiple
        commands/agencies and functional disciplines and a wide variety of resources. For example, an
        installation EOC established in response to a bioterrorism incident would include a mix of emergency
        management personnel, Naval security forces, fire and emergency services, electromagnetic pulse,
        public health, and medical treatment facility providers (including representatives of medical treatment
        facilities, pharmaceutical repositories, and laboratories).

CHARACTERISTICS AND FUNCTIONS
    L-19. Operations centers must be capable of communicating appropriately with other operations centers
        during incidents, including those maintained by state, local, other Service, private, and HN agencies.
        Communications between operations centers must be reliable and contain built-in redundancies. The
        efficient functioning of operations centers most frequently depends on the existence of mutual-aid

Appendix L



          agreements and joint communications protocols among participating agencies. When incidents cross
          disciplinary or jurisdictional boundaries or involve complex incident management scenarios, a
          multiagency coordination entity (a regional operations center or installation EOC), will be used to
          facilitate incident management and policy coordination.

TIERED ACTIVATION
      L-20. The communication, navigation, and identification EOC, regional operations centers, and
          installation EOCs operate under four activations levels. Each activation level is task-organized by the
          type of event that the emergency management team is addressing. Although an immediate increase
          from Activation Level Normal/1 directly to Activation Level 4 may be warranted in many situations,
          some emergencies will require the capability for transitional activation moving steadily up or down
          the scale. Examples of such incidents include covert biological terrorism, natural epidemics, and some
          natural/technological hazard events (fires, volcanoes, hurricanes, winter storms). The activation levels
          are as follows:
               Activation Level Normal—Normal Operations. No emergency incident exists that is
                sufficient to warrant the activation of the operations center. Activation Level Normal supports
                FP condition normal and FP condition alpha operations, which may include support of
                regional/installation emergency management working group meetings, regional/installation
                commander briefings, and threat/AT working group meetings.
               Activation Level 1 (Watch)—Enhanced Operations. No emergency incident exists that is
                sufficient to warrant the activation of the operations center. Activation Level 1 supports FP
                condition alpha and FP condition bravo operations. There is no emergency management program
                requirement for a 24/7 watch officer during Activation Level 1. Some regions and/or
                installations may have additional AT program requirements based on CCDR or fleet commander
                requirements. Typical causes for the initiation and sustainment of Activation Level 1 include
                terrorism threat warnings, criminal/terrorism surveillance activities, special-event planning,
                hurricane season/winter storm preparations, and similar events.
               Activation Level 2 (Special)—Specialized Operations. A unique emergency condition exists
                that is sufficient to warrant special activation of the operations center. Activation Level 2
                supports up to FP condition charlie operations and results in increased SA. There is no
                emergency management program requirement for a 24/7 watch officer during Activation Level
                2. Activation Level 2 simply provides additional planning and coordination support, including
                some specialized assistance from members of the emergency management team. Some regions
                and/or installations may have additional AT program requirements based on CCDR or fleet
                commander requirements. Typical causes for the initiation and sustainment of Activation Level
                2 include bomb threats, biological threat warning, preliminary laboratory results that are
                indicative of a potential biological incident (terrorism or natural causes), special events, active
                hurricane warnings/watches posted 48 to 96 hours prior to landfall, and similar events.
               Activation Level 3 (Partial Activation)—Limited Operations. Potential or actual emergency
                conditions exist that are sufficient to warrant the partial activation of the operations center.
                Activation Level 3 supports up to FP condition charlie operations and results in 24/7 SA, with
                the establishment of defined operational periods and associated reports. The primary operations
                center staff establishes necessary organizational sections; establishes communications with
                appropriate federal, state, local, other Service, and/or private, and HN counterparts; and
                determines the current status of emergency response and recovery resources. Typical causes for
                the initiation and sustainment of Activation Level 3 include evacuations involving more that 10
                percent of the population, natural/technological emergencies having limited/partial impact on
                some or all of a population (flooding, winter storms), landfall of tropical storms, expected
                landfall of hurricanes (within 24-36 hours), volcano warnings, moderate- to large-scale structural
                fires involving multiple agencies, small-scale wildfires involving mutual-aid support, small-scale
                hazardous materials spills/releases involving mutual-aid or environmental-spill response,
                national special security events, and similar events.

                   U.S. Navy Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Capabilities and Employment



            Activation Level 4 (Full) 24/7 Operations. Potential or actual emergency conditions exist that
             are sufficient to warrant the full activation of the operations center. Activation Level 4 supports
             up to FP condition delta operations and results in 24/7 SA, with the establishment of defined
             operational periods and associated reports. The emergency management team establishes
             organizational sections; establishes communications and initiates coordination with appropriate
             federal, state, local, other Service, private and HN counterparts; begins IM support, including the
             establishment of a joint information center; determines the current status of emergency response
             and recovery resources; and initiates resource management support for subordinate operations
             centers and the incident commander/unified command. Typical causes for the initiation and
             sustainment of Activation Level 4 include evacuations involving more that 50 percent of the
             population, earthquakes, tsunami warnings, tornados, expected landfall of hurricanes (within 24
             hours or less), overt terrorism incidents, moderate- to large-scale hazardous materials
             spills/releases involving mutual-aid or environmental-spill response, nuclear-related events,
             confirmed biological incidents (terrorism or natural causes), wide-scale power blackouts, and
             similar events.

                                   Execution Activities
       This appendix addresses the following execution activities:
           • Assessment during execution.
           • Conducting CBRN activities specific to execution.
           • Integrating processes during execution.
           • Making decisions during execution.

ASSESSING DURING EXECUTION
   M-1. Execution is more than putting a decision into action. It involves monitoring the situation, assessing
   the operation, and adjusting the order as needed.
   M-2. During execution, commanders continually assess operation progress based on information from the
   COP and running estimates. They ensure that subordinate units execute actions appropriate to the actual
   situation. Assessment keeps their SA current and allows commanders to continuously update their
   situational understanding and validate their visualization. When the situation varies from the assumptions
   that the order was based on, commanders direct adjustments to exploit opportunities and counter threats.
   M-3. Commanders understand, visualize, describe, direct, lead, and assess throughout the operations
   process, using CBRN shape and CBRN sense capabilities facilitated by linkages to the ISR process. (See
   figure M-1 for the commander’s role in the operations process.) They develop an understanding of the OE
   they visualize the desired end state and develop a broad concept of how to transform the current conditions
   into the desired end state. Commanders describe their visualization through the commander’s intent,
   planning guidance, and CONOPS. They also express gaps in relevant information as CCIR and essential
   elements of friendly information. Direction is implicit in command; commanders direct actions to achieve
   results and lead forces to mission accomplishment.

CONDUCTING CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, AND
NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES SPECIFIC TO EXECUTION
      M-4. To execute an operation, commanders synchronize the integrating processes and continuing
      activities. In addition, they perform the following CBRN activities specific to execution:
                  Focus CBRN assets on the decisive operation.
                  Adjust CCIR based on the situation.
                  Adjust control measures.
                  Manage movement and positioning of supporting CBRN units.
                  Adjust unit missions and CBRN-specific tasks as necessary.
                  Modify the CONOPS, as required.
                  Position or relocate committed, supporting, and reserve units.
                  Conduct logistics recovery and rearming.

INTEGRATING PROCESSES DURING EXECUTION
      M-5. IPOE/IPB, targeting, and intelligence synchronization continue during execution. IPOE/IPB is
      designed to reduce the commander’s uncertainties concerning weather, enemy, and terrain for a specific
      geographic area. It enables the commander to see the battlefield in a graphic format—where friendly and
      enemy forces can move, shoot, and communicate; where critical areas lie; and where friendly and enemy
      forces are most vulnerable. Conducting an IPOE/IPB with the intelligence staff officer is necessary to
      determine the most likely area for a CBRN attack and to focus CBRN assets toward that area. CBRN
      reconnaissance units are positioned throughout the battle zone based on the IPOE/IPB. These units provide
      a direct sight of defending units in battle positions. They are capable of issuing early warnings of chemical
      agents in the OE. The employment of CBRN reconnaissance assets provides freedom of movement by
      allowing the commander to reposition forces without the threat of contamination. Decontamination assets
      are positioned and allocated based on the IPOE/IPB. Operational decontamination is conducted in support
      of committed forces for the purpose of sustaining combat operations. The type, composition, and
      disposition of CBRN-capable units are identified in the AO and AOI, and friendly-force capabilities are
      identified (ranges and effectiveness of CBRN delivery systems, types of CBRN weapons available, and
      CBRN protective and detection equipment available). CBRN-related intelligence gaps are identified, and
      actions are initiated to fill them and begin new intelligence collection operations. CBRN-related gaps in
      priority intelligence requirements are identified and added to the collection plan. Threat models are updated
      with the CBRN-related data that has been collected, and threat doctrine is converted into a doctrinal
      template. High-value targets that may be targeted by CBRN weapons are identified.
      M-6. CBRN warning and reporting is a key activity during the execution phase of the operations process.
      Ordinarily, JWARN automated capabilities are used to facilitate the employment of CBRN warning
      technologies, providing integrated collection, analysis, identification, location, reporting, and dissemination
      of CBRN threat information that complements decisionmaking. CBRN warning and reporting can be done
      manually by conducting multiple calculations/computations in support of CBRN hazard predictions, but the
      process is manpower-intensive, susceptible to human error, and precludes timely dissemination.
      M-7. The JWARN provides the capability to rapidly receive, assimilate, and produce CBRN information
      that enhances the force commander’s CBRN awareness of the OE and reduces the risk to friendly forces.
      JWARN is an integral component of the execution function because it interoperates with other battle
      management systems by providing additional data processing, production of plans and reports, and access
      to specific CBRN shape activities to improve the efficiency of limited CBRN personnel assets.


M-2                        ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                    28 February 2011
                                                                                         Execution Activities



   M-8. The JWARN integrates deployed CBRN sensors into an integrated detection network—a group of
   autonomous sensors that provide CBRN event detection (CBRN sense) by monitoring the physical
   parameters of a CBRN threat agent or TIM (radiation, chemical signature). Individual sensors in an
   integrated detection network are deployed over an AOI. This area coverage provides immediate warning to
   forces located within the area and supports follow-on actions to determine the actual area of contamination.
   M-9. Currently, when a CBRN event occurs, the majority of CBRN agent sensors and alarms operate
   independently, and only those personnel in the immediate vicinity of the sensor are made aware of a
   warning signal. To ensure adequate FP, adjacent units also need to be notified of the hazard by radio, wire
   communications, or audible/verbal means.
   M-10. The JWARN will enable CBRN defense specialists and other designated personnel to update the
   COP with CBRN- and TIM-related information. JWARN will transfer data from existing sensors and to
   and from future sensors, provide alerts for potential CBRN risks to commanders and units, activate alarms
   for personnel at risk, and send warning (and dewarning) reports to affected units throughout the OE.
   M-11. JWARN operators will develop likely CBRN attack scenarios that reflect the capabilities of
   adversary forces. Analyzing these scenarios in JWARN as part of current-operation (near-term) planning
   will allow the operator to position CBRN sensors, pre-position CBRN equipment and consumables, and
   modify JEM templates so that high-fidelity hazard predictions better reflect the potential capabilities of
   adversary forces. Information from the analysis of likely CBRN scenarios will support decisionmaking at
   the tactical level of warfare by increasing the timeliness and accuracy of CBRN warning and reporting.
   (See appendix F for Service-specific applications for JWARN.)
   M-12. The JEM complements JWARN during execution activities by enhancing commanders’ capabilities
   to see first, understand first, and act first when responding to CBRN incidents and providing real-time
   hazard information to influence current operations. The CBRN staff uses JEM to interface and
   communicate with JWARN, weather systems, intelligence systems, and various databases, providing
   common representation of CBRN hazard areas and effects.
   M-13. The JEM supports operational and crisis action planning to mitigate the effects of WMD, to include
   weapons with CBRN payloads and TIM releases. Additionally, JEM assists DOD components and allied or
   coalition forces by providing CBRN and TIM hazard predictions and effects to the warfighter during and
   after an incident.
   M-14. Operational units will collect and report CBRN information to a CBRN cell. Through CBRN
   warning systems (JWARN), the CBRN cell will collect and correlate this information. The JEM will be
   used, automatically or manually, to calculate the transport and dispersion (the plumes of CBRN events),
   taking into account the terrain and weather information collected from appropriate agencies. The plumes of
   CBRN events will be formatted and processed by the warning system and broadcast to operational units’
   COP to provide a standardized picture of the effects of the CBRN hazard throughout the OE. JEM may also
   be operated as a stand-alone application that is not interfaced or networked with a C4I system when a
   network is unavailable.

MAKING DECISIONS DURING EXECUTION
   M-15. Decisionmaking continues throughout execution, but its form changes. MDMPs are not designed to
   address the time-sensitive decisions required to execute operations; therefore, commanders rely more on
   intuitive or naturalistic forms of decisionmaking than on analytic decisionmaking processes.
   M-16. Commanders make two basic types of decisions during execution: execution decisions and
   adjustment decisions:
            Execution decision. An execution decision is the selection, during preparation and execution, of
             a COA anticipated by the order. (FM 6-0) The most basic form of an execution decision is
             applying resources or activities as outlined in the plan or within minor deviations from the plan.
             Commanders often delegate execution decisions to subordinates.
            Adjustment decision. An adjustment decision is the selection of a COA, during preparation and
             execution that modifies the order to respond to unanticipated opportunities or threats. (FM 6-0)
             These decisions are rarely delegated to subordinates. When commanders adjust the order, it



28 February 2011       ATTP 3-11.36/MCRP 3-37B/NTTP 3-11.34/AFTTP 3-2.70, C1                               M-3
Appendix M



                normally requires resynchronizing operations across the warfighting functions. Commanders
                may have to describe their visualization of the adjustment and provide guidance on affected
                control measures. Staff members take necessary actions within their areas of expertise to
                implement the decision.
      M-17. Decisions during execution are not tied to a cycle or battle rhythm, although some parts of them
      may be. Being able to act when events occur, not at a predetermined point, is important for effective
      execution. Only in this way can commanders operate within the enemy decision cycle at a tempo that the
      enemy cannot match. Effective decisionmaking during execution meets the following criteria:
                It is a comprehensive, integrated combined arms process, not a series of stovepiped processes.
                It relates actions to the commander’s intent and CONOPS to ensure that they support the
                 decisive operation.
                It relies heavily on intuitive decisionmaking by commanders and staffs to make rapid
                 adjustments.
                It is continuous and can react immediately to opportunity or CBRN threat.
                It accommodates cyclical process requirements, but is not tied to them.
