                                            Chapter 2

                                           GENERAL

2.1. Basic Instructions: A bird/wildlife aircraft strike hazard exists at HARB and its vicinity
due to resident and migratory bird species and other wildlife. Daily and seasonal bird
movements create various hazardous conditions. This Instruction establishes procedures to
minimize bird strikes at HARB and local flying areas. No single solution exists to the BASH
risk. The risk must be managed from every angle. A variety of techniques and organizations are
involved in administering the program and managing the risk. Specifically, this Instruction is
designed to:
   2.1.1. Establish procedures to identify and avoid high risk situations, and to aid supervisors
   and pilots in altering/discontinuing flying operations when required.
   2.1.2. Help disseminate information to all assigned and transient pilots on bird hazards and
   procedures for bird avoidance.
   2.1.3. Establish guidelines to decrease airfield attractiveness to birds.
   2.1.4. Provide procedures for dispersing birds when they occur on the airfield or at the
   Miami-Dade County Land Fill (M-DCLF).
   2.1.5. Sustain a Bird Hazard Working Group (BHWG) and designate responsibilities to its
   members.
   2.1.6. Compile seasonal/yearly data to track bird concentration patterns and help make
   educated decisions regarding the flying schedule.
2.2. Airfield and Local Area. Homestead Air Reserve Base is located on 1943 acres in
southeast Miami-Dade County, Florida, approximately three miles from the Biscayne Bay
Seashore and wholly within the confines of the South Miami-Dade Wildlife Conservation area.
The average elevation of this area is six feet above sea level. Several features of the surrounding
area are conducive to bird habitation. The Base is bordered by large tracts of farmland. There is
a large Miami-Dade County landfill located approximately five miles north of the base. Birds
are attracted to landfills just as they are to any source of food. Homestead Air Reserve Base is
drained by several man-made canals and drainage ditches. These canals and drainage ditches
provide an excellent environment for water birds.
2.3. Area surrounding the runway complex. The area surrounding the runway complex
consists of a mix of Florida grasses which is carefully maintained by a civilian contractor. The
infield area between the taxiways and runway remains attractive to wildlife in search of food,
shelter, and water. Some parts are designated as wetlands and maintained only periodically.
2.4. Low level routes. 482d Fighter Wing (482 FW) aircraft are restricted from using the local
overland low-level flying routes and areas. The 482 FW weighed the training benefits of low
level flying against the risk to its pilots and aircraft and decided to discontinue low level
operations. This decision to terminate low-level flying can be rescinded any time mission
requirements change. References to low level activities will remain in this publication for
possible future use. When low level procedures were in effect HARB aircraft used southern
Florida as the primary low-level flying area. This area has many features which attract a variety

of birds from migratory waterfowl and unnamed species, to shore birds and indigenous soaring
birds. The two most hazardous species are migratory waterfowl and raptors (hawks, black
vultures, turkey vultures). Specific hazards are outlined in Chapter 4.
2.5. Avon Park Air Force Range. Avon Park occupies 106,110 acres of land in Polk and
Highlands counties in central Florida. Most of the area is typically southern Florida Flatwoods
comprised of nearly level sandy flatlands with small swamps and wet grasslands. The terrain in
and around Avon Park provides an abundant variety of habitats for birds that are hazardous to
aircraft. Specifics are outlined in Chapter 4.
2.6. Execution:
     2.6.1. Reducing the bird strike hazard at HARB requires a cooperative effort between
     several base organizations. The OPR for coordinating this Instruction is 482 FW/ Safety
     Office (482 FW/SE).
     2.6.2. Bird Hazard Working Group (BHWG):
        2.6.2.1. Function. Collects, compiles, and reviews data on bird strikes; identifies and
        recommends actions to reduce hazards. Recommends changes in operational procedures.
        Prepares informational programs for pilots. Assists the operations group commander by
        acting as a point of contact for off-base BASH issues.
        2.6.2.2. Authority. The BHWG submits all recommendations to the operational
        commander for approval. Implementation is through normal chain of command.
        2.6.2.3. Composition. The chairperson is the Vice Wing Commander. As a minimum,
        the group will consist of a representative from Flight Safety, Aircraft Maintenance, Civil
        Engineering, Airfield Management, tenant units, and representatives from other tasked
        organizations (Chapter 2) as required.
        2.6.2.4. Meeting Schedule. The BHWG will meet quarterly as part of the Combined
        Environmental Safety and Occupational Health (ESOH) Council during Phase I (April
        through October) normal bird activity. HARB has designated the months of November
        through March as Phase II. Phase II normally indicates periods of increased bird activity
        due to seasonal migrations. Historically, migratory activities that HARB experiences are
        not consistent from one year to another. During one given year the base might
        experience migratory birds and then not again for several more years. With this
        information in mind, during Phase II months the 482 FW/SE office will meet weekly
        with the biologists assigned to the base and discuss any ongoing trends. Additionally, the
        Wing Safety office will run the Phase II Migratory Bird Hazard ORM Checklist. If there
        is unusual bird activity or trending the Wing Safety office will convene a meeting of the
        BHWG to recommend implementing Phase II procedures. If no increased activity exists
        the BHWG will stay on a quarterly meeting schedule. The USDA Biologists will publish
        a monthly report throughout the year to document all activities and trends.

3.19. Flying Safety Officer:
482FWI91-212 20 JUNE 2011                                                                       9


   3.19.1. Ensures pilots promptly report all bird strikes and hazardous conditions per this
   directive.
   3.19.2. In the absence of the Base Biologist, logs all bird strikes affecting HARB aircraft in
   the AFSAS database.
   3.19.3. Ensure that the current bird activity data is available and briefed for each applicable
   planned phase of flight, and educates pilots on the use of the Bird Avoidance Model (BAM)
   and Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) computer programs.
   3.19.4. Ensure adequate supplies of BASH report forms (Form 853) are readily available for
   pilots. The blank forms are in the FCIF volume V (Flight Safety) located at the 93d Fighter
   Squadron (93 FS) Operations Desk, or at maintenance debrief.
   3.19.5. Briefs pilots on seasonal bird hazards, specifically during Phase II periods,
   contingencies and after-dark operations. Movies, articles, cross tells and other information
   will be used as appropriate to maintain awareness.
3.20. Base Civil Engineer:
   3.20.1. Provides natural resources representation to the BHWG to monitor and advise the
   group of relevant environmental factors.
   3.20.2. Develops procedures for removal or control of bird attractants.
   3.20.3. Initiates surveys and writes environmental impact assessments and statements as
   required.
   3.20.4. Corrects environmental conditions that increase BASH potential.
   3.20.5. Uses land management practices that reduce BASH potential.
   3.20.6. Modifies airfield habitat consistent with runway lateral and approach zone
   management criteria. Accomplishes habitat reduction to reduce the bird risk beyond the
   1000 feet distance criterion.
   3.20.7. Managing Grass Height. Maintains a uniform grass height between 7 and 14 inches.
   Determine mowing frequency as needed to maintain height requirements. Coordinate
   mowing with periods of low flight activity. Cut grass before it goes to seed to discourage
   seed-eating birds from utilizing the airfield. Proper grass height discourages flocking species
   from entering the airfield because reduced visibility disrupts inter-flock communication and
   flock integrity and also prevents predator detection. As a rule, do not permit grass to exceed
   14 inches as high grass will attract some bird species and rodents which, in turn, attract
   raptors (birds of prey).
   3.20.8. Airfields with a variety of grass species may have a fast-growing strain which
   reaches 14 inches sooner than the rest of the airfield. Mow when the average grass height
   exceeds 14 inches. Mowing should start at the runway edge or as close as possible. Mow
   parallel to the runway and work toward the infield to avoid scaring birds towards the runway.
   Obtain assistance in herbicide selection for weed control, appropriate grass seed selection,
   fertilization, and erosion control vegetation from the US Soil Conservation Service or the
   Agricultural Extension Service.
 10                                                            482FWI91-212 20 JUNE 2011


   3.20.9. Controlling broad-leaf weeds. Keep broad-leaf weeds to a minimum on the airfield.
   Apply herbicides, as necessary, to achieve this. Broad-leaf weeds attract a variety of birds,
   may produce seeds or berries, and may limit grass growth.
3.21. Chief, Airfield Management:
   3.21.1. The authority to declare bird watch conditions is vested with the SOF during normal
   flight operations. During all other periods, the Chief of Airfield Management, or their
   designated representative, is the declaring authority.
   3.21.2. The Chief of Airfield Management bases the declaration of a bird watch condition
   on:
      3.21.2.1. Observations made by the base or BASH contractor.
      3.21.2.2. Information relayed by airborne aircraft or other HARB personnel, familiar
      with the BASH program, working on the airfield.
      3.21.2.3. Observations made and relayed to base operations by HARB tower, End of
      Runway crews, and Transient Alert personnel.
   3.21.3. The Chief of Airfield Management should appoint a bird scare team. This team is
   activated at times when birds on the airfield create hazardous conditions, but as a minimum
   when Bird Watch Condition "Severe" is declared. The bird scare team will, as a minimum,
   have immediate access to bioacoustics and pyrotechnic equipment for bird dispersal. This
   equipment must be stored in an approved location where access is readily available.
3.22. Supervisor of Flying (SOF):
   3.22.1. Authority to declare bird watch conditions is vested with the SOF during normal
   flight operations. The SOF considers inputs from agencies below, but the Bird Hazard
   Condition declaration, responsibility, and authority rests with the SOF. The SOF bases the
   declaration of a bird watch condition on:
      3.22.1.1. Observations made by the base or BASH contractor.
      3.22.1.2. Information relayed by airborne aircraft.
      3.22.1.3. Observations made, and relayed to base operations by HARB tower, End of
      Runway crews, and Transient Alert personnel.
   3.22.2. Implements flying procedures in response to elevations in the Bird Watch Condition.
   Informs the OG commander and the Chief of Airfield Management of Bird Severe
   declaration and includes the status of any airborne HARB aircraft.
   3.22.3. Fills out the End of Tour Spot Inspection Report located on the computer at the SOF
   station in the tower. The changes in BWC are data based to help in tracking efforts.
3.23. Contracted BASH service providerwill:
   3.23.1. Monitor the airfield during all 482 FW day flying periods and minimize the bird
   hazard using techniques defined in this publication. Additionally, during times of the year
   when birds are active at night (migratory swallows) birdman will cover all night flying
   periods.
482FWI91-212 20 JUNE 2011                                                                      11


  3.23.2. Will request assistance from the bird scare team through the Chief of Airfield
  Management when conditions are beyond the birdman’s ability to control the bird hazard.
  3.23.3. Request access to the airfield from the Chief of ATC or their representative in the
  tower via the Ground Control frequency and inform the tower when vacating the airfield
  environment.
  3.23.4. Maintains a current bird activity map for HARB.
  3.23.5. Briefs pertinent information gained from conducting his job to the BHWG and the
  quarterly EOSH Council. Additionally, he should provide any additional information on
  migratory, local, and seasonal bird activities through contact Audubon Society, local
  ornithologists, and other agencies.
  3.23.6. Compiles daily BWC data to help plan the flying activities at HARB.
  3.23.7. Implements many various techniques for decreasing the bird threat to HARB aircraft.
     3.23.7.1. Bioacoustics. Bioacoustics is taped distress or alarm calls of actual birds. The
     equipment required to adequately project these calls includes a cassette tape deck
     mounted in a vehicle and a speaker mounted on its roof. Special care must be taken to
     play the tape in short intervals to prevent habituation by the birds. Play the tape for 20-30
     seconds and then pause briefly. Repeat the procedure several times if necessary. The
     birds should respond by taking flight or becoming alert. These calls are effective for
     gulls, blackbirds, starlings, cowbirds, grackles, ravens, crows, and some shorebirds.
     Pyrotechnics should be used in conjunction with bioacoustics to enhance complete
     dispersal.
     3.23.7.2. Pyrotechnics. Pyrotechnics are 12- gauge (or similar) scare cartridges that
     produce a secondary explosion to scare the birds from the area. The scare cartridges are
     launched from either a shotgun or a pyrotechnic pistol. Pyrotechnics are effective for
     dispersing most bird species.
     3.23.7.3. Propane Cannons. Propane cannons may also be used. These devices should
     be operated, especially at dawn and dusk, as birds come in to feed or roost. Cannons
     must be relocated frequently to avoid habituation problems. These devices are very
     effective on waterfowl, pheasants, and other game birds and can also be used for gulls
     and blackbirds.
     3.23.7.4. Depredation. Birds must be killed occasionally as a reinforcement of other
     methods. Domestic pigeons, European starlings, and house sparrows can be killed
     without a permit. Most other species require federal and state permits. When Airfield
     Management is involved in any depredation action they shall coordinate through the
     contractor for permits and direction in this area.
     3.23.7.5. Other Devices. Ingenuity is encouraged in the bird scare program. Other
     devices may be used. Radio-controlled model aircraft, hawk kites, model birds in
     distressed positions, falconry, etc., may all be considered based on availability and
     problem bird species. Contact the BASH team at HQAFSC/SEFW, 9700 Ave, G. SE,
     Bldg 24499, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5670, for advice in this area.
  3.23.8. Ineffective Methods. Ultrasound, rubber snakes, stuffed owls, rotating/ flashing
  lights, loud music, and other such devices have not proven effective and should not be used.
 12                                                              482FWI91-212 20 JUNE 2011


   3.23.9. Conducts daily airfield and M-DCLF surveys. Dead birds should be removed and
   routed through the Wing Safety office for identification by the Smithsonian Institute.
   3.23.10. Tracks and collects daily and seasonal data on BASH low, moderate, and severe
   conditions for BASH prevention purposes. The data can be obtained from the Chief of ATC
   or their representative in the tower, and from the Supervisor of Flying (End of Tour spot
   inspection forms). This data will help the 482 FW identify hazardous trends and modify the
   flying program if required.
   3.23.11. Tracks bird numbers to establish seasonal migration levels that affect the BASH
   program.
   3.23.12. Works with the Flying Safety Officer logging all bird strikes in the Air Force,
   AFSAS database.
   3.23.13. Coordinates with pilots and maintenance personnel for collecting of non-fleshy
   remains after strikes. Sends any salvaged bird strike remains to the Smithsonian Institution
   at the address below for identification.

Figure 3.1. Smithsonian Institution Natural History Bldg.




       3.23.13.1. Provide 482 FW/SE office with a monthly written report on the bird activities
       and trends for HARB.
3.24. Chief, Air Traffic Control:
   3.24.1. Chief of ATC or their designated representative in the tower reports observed bird
   activity and recommended bird watch condition to the SOF or Airfield Management/Bash
   contractor as appropriate. During periods when HARB aircraft are not flying ATC has the
   authority to raise the BWC status, but not lower it without Airfield Management
   concurrence.
   3.24.2. Issues bird watch advisories to pilots as required.
   3.24.3. Provides Contractor/Airfield Management prompt access to the runway under bird
   watch condition MODERATE or SEVERE.
3.25. Tenant Units:
   3.25.1. Det 1, 125 FW and Miami Air and Marine Branch will provide a representative to
   the BHWG and support the base BASH program as appropriate. Responsibilities during
   various BWCs are outlined in Chapter 6.
3.26. Avon Park Range (R2901):
482FWI91-212 20 JUNE 2011                                                                  13


  3.26.1. Avon Park Range uses the AFPAM 91-212 terminology for making bird watch
  condition calls on the range area. If other than low, expect the Range Control Officer (RCO)
  to advise the flight of the current bird condition. For example, “Mako 1, bird condition
  moderate at Avon Aux, or bird condition moderate in the South extension as reported by
  Shark 1, 15 minutes ago”. The RCO has the overriding authority to declare BWCs for the
  auxiliary (AUX) Field and Bombing Ranges due to his proximity to the sites.
 14                                                               482FWI91-212 20 JUNE 2011


                                           Chapter 4

                                          WILDLIFE

4.1. Wildlife. This chapter provides a summary of the bird strike hazards and recommendations
for reducing each hazard to flight operations. A brief description of birds commonly involved in
collisions with aircraft, and how each method of control or avoidance is to be employed is
provided. Each control measure will have a corresponding tasked organization in the basic
Instruction.
4.2. Specific Hazards for HARB:
   4.2.1. Loons, Grebes, Pelicans, Cormorants, Mergansers. These are fish-eating birds.
   Control is best accomplished by removing fish-producing ponds near the airfield. Removal
   of the food source is not always possible, and pyrotechnics can be used to effectively frighten
   the birds from the area. Avoid flying at sunrise and sunset when large flocks, often in
   formation, can be found flying to and from feeding areas.
   4.2.2. Long-legged Waders (Herons, Egrets, Ibises, Storks). Most of these species are
   attracted to water where they feed on fish, amphibians, reptiles, and arthropods. Control is
   best accomplished by eliminating the food sources. Steepening the sides of ditches and
   ponds and removing emergent vegetation will drastically reduce accessibility to food sources.
   Use pyrotechnics to disperse any birds that remain after habitat modification.
   4.2.3. Cattle Egrets. These birds have different feeding habits than their relatives, preferring
   open fields where they primarily feed on insects. They frequently follow mowers for the
   insects which are stirred up. When possible mow during non-flying hours when Cattle Egrets
   are present. Maintain grass height between 7 to 14 inches. Additionally, periodic pesticide
   application may be necessary for insect control. Eliminate roost sites on or near the base by
   removing or thinning roost trees and brush, and dispersing the birds each evening with
   pyrotechnics.
   4.2.4. Migrating waterfowl. Migrating waterfowl are particularly dangerous to flight safety
   due to the large numbers, size, and generally higher altitude of the birds. Large flocks of
   waterfowl travel along traditional flyways to their breeding and wintering grounds during
   spring and fall. The flocks may stop along the route awaiting favorable weather conditions to
   continue. Migrating birds are most active from sunset through midnight, with numbers
   decreasing in the early morning hours. October and November are the most hazardous
   months. Avoid flying during the evening hours if possible. Obtain Bird Avoidance Model
   (BAM) data from the BASH website for information and planning purposes for comparing
   low level routes. Wintering concentration areas should be avoided.
   4.2.5. Raptors (Hawks, Falcons, Kites, Eagles, Vultures). These birds can be particularly
   hazardous to aircraft because of their size and widespread distribution over bases and low
   level areas. Raptors (particularly vultures) use thermals to their advantage to search for prey.
   These birds become active during mid-morning and remain aloft until late afternoon. Avoid
   areas with thermal generating terrain such as ridge lines, rolling hills, and near water.
   Landfills are particularly attractive to soaring vultures. Our neighborhood landfill is only 2.1
   NM north of the approach end of Runway 23. Utilization of a second Base Contractor may
   significantly reduce the threat that the landfill poses to the airfield environment. In the fall,
482FWI91-212 20 JUNE 2011                                                                      15


  raptors migrate by day to areas of heavy winter concentrations in the southern states and
  throughout Central America. These birds can be controlled by removing dead animals on the
  airfield, proper management of landfills, rodent control on airfields, and removal of dead
  trees and other perching sites on the airfield. Use pyrotechnics to frighten raptors from the
  airfield.
  4.2.6. Cranes. These large birds are most hazardous during migrating periods, particularly in
  the fall when many thousands of birds may be concentrated in a small area. Avoid flying at
  dawn and dusk in areas of known concentration. Use pyrotechnics on the airfield to disperse
  these birds.
  4.2.7. Sandpipers/Shorebirds. The most significant hazard from these birds occurs when
  large numbers flock in tight groups, particularly during migration and along coastlines. Many
  of the upland species such as upland sandpipers and buff-breasted sandpipers may nest on
  airfields in spring and early summer. Other species such as killdeer are quite adept at
  avoiding aircraft and do not pose a significant hazard. Flocks in coastal areas can be
  hazardous and should be avoided. To control these birds, observe proper grass height
  management. Eliminate water in puddles and steepen ditch banks to limit access to these
  birds. Use pyrotechnics for all species, and some respond well to bioacoustics.
  4.2.8. Gulls. These birds represent the most significant hazard to aircraft worldwide. Due to
  their omnivorous feeding habits and preference for flat, open areas to rest, they are
  commonly found on airfields. Gulls are most active just after sunrise and before sunset as
  they move to and from feeding areas. Improperly operated landfills are a significant source
  of attraction for gulls and should not be allowed in the airfield vicinity. Maintain grass
  height between 7 and 14 inches. This is critical in reducing gull numbers. Even with this in
  effect, gulls may inhabit the airfield, particularly during inclement weather. Persistent
  harassment using pyrotechnics and bioacoustics is necessary to discourage these birds.
  Occasionally, use live ammunition to reinforce these techniques. Consider other techniques
  such as gas cannons, model gulls, radio-controlled model aircraft, and even falconry if
  available and cost effective. Poisoning of earthworms and insects (especially grasshoppers)
  may be accomplished if these invertebrates are found to attract gulls. Do not allow these
  birds to establish a habit of using the airfield to feed, breed, or rest.
  4.2.9. Terns. These are fish-eating, gull-like birds common in coastal areas and on some
  major river systems and lakes. Avoid flying near areas where these birds may be active, such
  as nesting colonies or piers in coastal areas. Remove the food source or eliminate the fish
  containing ponds if these birds pose a significant hazard.
  4.2.10. Pigeons and Doves. These birds are seed-eaters and are attracted to seed-producing
  weeds, grasses, and shrubs. Open areas or bare spots are attractive as resting or feeding sites.
  Pyrotechnics can be effective in frightening these birds. Proper grass-height management,
  irrigation, and mowing before grass goes to seed will limit the number of pigeons and doves
  on the field. Pigeons frequently occur in structures such as hangars. Netting, shooting,
  trapping, poisons baiting, and especially toxic bird perches (such as Rid-A-Bird) can
  drastically reduce their numbers in these structures.
  4.2.11. Owls. Most owls are nocturnal and attracted to rodents as a food source. Rodent
  control may be necessary on the airfield; proper management of airfield grass will limit their
 16                                                               482FWI91-212 20 JUNE 2011


   numbers. Remove perch sites such as unnecessary fence posts and dead trees to limit the
   number of owls. Avoid over flying landfills at night to reduce hazards from owls.
   4.2.12. Goatsuckers (Nighthawks, Whippoorwills, etc.). These birds are active, particularly
   at sunset when insects are abundant. Little can be done to limit their numbers other than
   insect control. Avoid flying at times when these birds are abundant, particularly near lakes,
   streams, or other areas with large insect populations.
   4.2.13. .Flycatchers. These birds are present on airfields to feed on insects. Strikes are
   infrequent, but should not be overlooked. Control is best accomplished by controlling insects
   and removing perch sites such as fence posts, tree limbs, and bushes.
   4.2.14. Crows and Ravens. These omnivorous birds are common in open areas and around
   landfills. These birds may occur in large flocks, particularly at sunset as they return to roost
   sites. Proper grass -height management will reduce population numbers. Remove any known
   roost sites or thin individual roost trees. Operate landfills in a manner to discourage these
   birds. Use bioacoustics and pyrotechnics to frighten these birds if they occur on the field.
   4.2.15. Blackbirds, Grackles, Cowbirds, and Starlings. These birds can be particularly
   hazardous because they frequently occur in huge flocks, sometimes in the millions.
   Blackbirds and starlings are attracted to flat, open areas to feed, rest, or stage/pre-roost.
   Maintain grass height between 7 and 14 inches to best reduce airfield blackbird and starling
   numbers. Do not allow seed producing plants to grow on the airfield or out lease grain crops
   in areas where these birds are known to occur. Eliminate roost sites near the flight line.
   Selectively prune or remove roost trees, brush, or cattails if blackbirds and starlings are
   roosting on base. Blackbirds and starlings respond well to an intense frightening program
   using bioacoustics and pyrotechnics. Use other methods to supplement this program as
   necessary. Starlings are not federally protected and may be killed without permits. Permits
   are required for other species. Occasional shooting of birds will reinforce other frightening
   techniques. Consider poisoning or trapping, with US Fish and Wildlife Service assistance. If
   these birds occur in hangars, use toxic bird perches to eliminate the problem. Avoid at all
   costs flying near known blackbird and starling roosts, especially at sunrise and sunset and
   during spring and fall migration. Huge roosting colonies may also be present during winter
   months in southern states.
4.3. Other Wildlife. While concern is mostly centered on birds, several mammalian and reptile
species also pose threats to flight operations and must be considered. Close coordination with
the Wildlife Management is necessary to reduce this type of hazard.
   4.3.1. Rodents. These animals attract raptors. Control by maintaining a uniform turf at
   proper heights. Rodenticides may be used in some cases.
   4.3.2. Alligators/Caiman. Large alligators and Caiman are often reported on the airfield.
   They usually occur after heavy rains. The 482 FW will work with Pesky Miami-Dade
   contractor licensed to deal with large reptiles. No other HARB agency should attempt any
   type of handling.
   4.3.3. Turtles. Occasionally, large soft- shell turtles are reported on the airfield. If they are
   on the taxiways/runway, remove them and place them a good distance from the hard
   surfaces.
482FWI91-212 20 JUNE 2011                                                                         17

                                    REPORTS AND FORMS

5.1. Reports and Forms. This Chapter outlines the procedures and forms required to report
bird strikes IAW AFP 91-212 and AFI 91-204 to enhance the BASH program at HARB.
   5.1.1. All bird strikes (damaging and non-damaging) are sent to the USAF BASH Team.
   Report damaging and non-damaging strikes to installation-owned aircraft as they occur on
   AF Form 853, Air Force Bird Strike Report. The AF Forms 853 will be logged into the
   AFSAS system by the Flight Safety Officer or the BASH contractor.
   https://sas.kirtland.af.mil/. Obtain additional information on bird hazard reduction from
   AFPAM 91-212, Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques, and BASH
   management responsibilities in AFI 91-202 for additional information on BASH
   requirements.
5.2. Installation flight safety officers. Installation flight safety officers must report all strikes
to installation-owned Air Force aircraft regardless of the geographic location of the strikes. For
strikes occurring at airfields other than HARB, the 482 FW Flight Safety Officer will log the
original report in the AFSAS database and send a copy to the flight safety office of the
installation at which the strike occurred (including non-Air Force airfields).

                              OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

6.1. Pilot Actions: The 482 FW has Operationally Risk Assessed its flying procedures and
modified flying operations to reflect current worldwide mission requirements and decrease pilot
and aircraft exposure to the majority of the threat. These actions should greatly decrease the
potential for a Bird strike mishap. The following pilot actions will be followed by 482 FW pilots
under BWCs SEVERE, MODERATE or LOW:
   6.1.1. SEVERE: No takeoffs or landings will be permitted for 482 FW aircraft into an
   airport that is under BWC SEVERE, unless the 482 OG/CC or his designated representative
   grants approval for operational reasons. 482 FW aircraft already airborne and operating over
   Air to Ground ranges will remain above 3000 feet Above Ground Level (AGL) to include
   diving delivery recoveries. 482 FW aircraft that declare an in flight emergency can operate
   as necessary to safely land the aircraft.
   6.1.2. MODERATE: Takeoffs are permitted for 482 FW aircraft. On recovery only a single
   approach or overhead to a full stop landing is allowed. No pattern work is allowed without
   approval from the 482 OG/CC or his designated representative. During Air to Ground
   training plan bomb release altitudes above 3000’ AGL for all bomb deliveries with
   momentary deviations below 3000’ AGL allowed during recovery from the dive only. The
   exception to this is when accomplishing RAP tasking events and updating currencies while
   working on Bravo and Charlie ranges under the control of the Avon Park RCO.
   Familiarization (FAM) events, Mission Qualification Training (MQT) and Initial
   Qualification Training (IQT) must be risk assessed and approved by the 482 FW/OG.
   6.1.3. LOW: All normal operations are allowed for 482 FW aircraft. Plan all deliveries
   above 3000’ AGL except when operating on Avon Park Range in Bravo and Charlie range
   patterns. On those ranges the aircraft may descend to Low Altitude Event minimums during
   bombing and strafe passes while working with the Avon Park RCO. For clarification,
   aircraft working on the Northern or Southern Tactical Ranges, and all other parts of the range
   must remain above 3000’ AGL, (except for dive recovery) even when under control of a
   ground forward air controller such as a visiting JTAC, TACP, or an ALO.
   6.1.4. Communications: Disseminate bird watch conditions by the following means. During
   periods of flight operations at HARB, or in low-level routes/training areas, etc, include bird
   watch conditions other than LOW in the ATIS information. Upon receipt of a bird watch
   condition other than LOW the tower controllers notify base operations of the new status and
   base operations notifies the command post. The Command Post will notify Wing Safety, and
   the 93FS. Base operations also ensure bird watch information is posted at the flight data
   counter for Transient Aircrews.
6.2. Low Level Routes: Low levels are no longer flown locally by 482 FW aircraft, except
for incentive flights flown on IR 53 (over the water). The following information will be
followed by visiting aircraft or if wing policy changes and the need to fly low levels arise. If
the US Bird Avoidance Model Program (BAM) located at www.usahas.com/bam/ is reporting
MODERATE or above, low levels routes will not be flown. Additionally, low level routes will
482FWI91-212 20 JUNE 2011                                                                       19


normally not be scheduled during the October-March time frame. In either case, the 482 FW
OG/CC can waive this for MODERATE depending on mission requirements.
   6.2.1. BWC SEVERE. High bird population on/above or in the vicinity of the active runway
   or intended areas of flight that represents a high potential for strike. Supervisors and
   aircrews must thoroughly evaluate mission needs before conducting operations in areas under
   condition SEVERE.
   6.2.2. BWC MODERATE. Bird activity in locations, which poses an increased potential for
   strike. This condition requires higher vigilance by all agencies and supervisors, and caution
   by aircrews.
   6.2.3. BWC LOW. Normal bird activity in the area of flight with a low probability of
   hazard.
6.3. Declaring Authority:
   6.3.1. During HARB flying periods: Authority to declare bird watch conditions is vested
   with the SOF during normal flight operations. The SOF considers inputs from all sources
   listed below, but the Bird Hazard Condition declaration, responsibility, and authority rests
   with the SOF.
   6.3.2. During periods of 482 FW non-flying operations: The Chief of Airfield Management
   or their designee is the declaring authority. The normal designee is the base biologist. See
   section 3.8 and 3.9.
       6.3.2.1. The authority will declare conditions based on ground observations, pilot
       reports, radar observations, the US Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) internet site located at
       www.usahas.com/bam/ or inputs from other HARB personnel with knowledge of the
       BASH program.
       6.3.2.2. Recommendations should be made to tower personnel over UHF, VHF, or FM
       radio nets or through the telephone.
   6.3.3. Avon Park Range (R2901): The RCO has the overriding authority to declare BWCs
   for the AUX Field, Charlie and Foxtrot ranges due to his proximity to the sites.
   6.3.4. Low Levels: Low levels are no longer flown locally by 482 FW aircraft, except
   for incentive flights flown on IR 53 (over the water). The following information will be
   followed if wing policy changes and the need to fly low levels arise. If Avon Park Range
   is calling the range MODERATE or SEVERE, low levels will not be flown. Additionally,
   low levels will normally not be scheduled during the October-March time frame. In either
   case, the 482 Opertions Group (OG)can waive this for MODERATE depending on mission
   requirements.
6.4. Over water Air to Air Airspace: Normally birds do not affect the over water airspace.
The areas used by the 482 FW are a significant distance away from land and any birds in the area
are low flying types. Pilots are allowed to descend to their event minimums in these areas. If the
flight lead assesses the area to be bird moderate or higher for an unusual circumstance the flight
will use 3000’ AGL as a minimum for operations.
6.5. Pilot Responsibilities and Procedures: If a pilot observes or encounters any bird activity
while in flight, which could constitute a hazard, the pilot should contact the Supervisor of Flying

(SOF), Control Tower, or Range Operations and request that the observed bird activity is passed
to the SOF or Base Operations, as appropriate. The following information is necessary:
   6.5.1. K - Call -sign
   6.5.2. K - Location/Altitude
   6.5.3. K - Time of sighting
   6.5.4. K - Type of bird (if known)
   6.5.5. K - Approximate number of birds
   6.5.6. K - Behavior of birds (soaring, flying to or from a location etc.)
6.6. Pilot Actions: The 482 FW has Operationally Risk Assessed its flying procedures and
modified flying operations to reflect current worldwide mission requirements and decrease pilot
and aircraft exposure to the majority of the threat. These actions should greatly decrease the
potential for a Bird strike mishap. The following pilot actions will be followed by 482 FW pilots
under BWCs SEVERE, MODERATE or LOW:
   6.6.1. SEVERE: Remain above 3000 feet AGL to include dive delivery recoveries.
   6.6.2. MODERATE: Plan bomb release altitudes above 3000’ AGL for all bomb deliveries
   with deviations below 3000’ AGL during recovery from the dive only. The only exception
   to this is when accomplishing RAP tasking events and updating currencies while working on
   Bravo and Charlie ranges under the control of the Avon Park RCO. FAM events, MQT and
   IQT must be risk assessed and approved by the 482 FW/OG.
   6.6.3. LOW: Plan all deliveries above 3000’ AGL except when operating in Bravo and
   Charlie range patterns. On those ranges the aircraft may descend to Low Altitude Event
   minimums during bombing and strafe passes while working with the Avon Park Range
   Control Officer (RCO). For clarification, aircraft working on the Northern or Southern
   Tactical Ranges, and all other parts of the range must remain above 3000’ AGL, (except for
   dive recovery) even when under control of a ground forward air controller such as a visiting
   Enlisted Terminal Attack Controller (ETAC), Tactical Air Control Party (TACP), or an Air
   Liaison Officer (ALO).
   6.6.4. Communications: Disseminate bird watch conditions by the following means. During
   periods of flight operations at HARB, or in low-level routes/training areas, etc, include bird
   watch conditions other than LOW in the ATIS information. Upon receipt of a bird watch
   condition other than LOW the tower controllers notify base operations of the new status and
   base operations notifies the command post. The Command Post will notify Wing Safety, and
   the 93 FS. Base operations also ensure bird watch information is posted at the flight data
   counter for Transient Aircrews.
6.7. Low Level Routes: Low levels are no longer flown locally by 482 FW aircraft, except
for incentive flights flown on IR 53 (over the water). The following information will be
followed by visiting aircraft or if wing policy changes and the need to fly low levels arise. If
Avon Park Range is reporting the range MODERATE or above, low levels routes will not be
flown. Additionally, low level routes will normally not be scheduled during the October-March
time frame. In either case, the 482 FW OG/CC can waive this for MODERATE depending on
mission requirements.
482FWI91-212 20 JUNE 2011                                                                      21


6.8. 482 FW Off-Station BWC Procedures. 482 FW Off-Station BWC Procedures for Transit
of Civilian/Military Airfields That Do Not.
   6.8.1. Report Bird Watch Conditions: The following procedures will be followed by 482
   FW pilots while in transit to, or operating at off-station airports (Civ or Mil) that do not
   report BWCs. Pilots will aggressively seek to obtain the expected bird activity at destination
   airport or enroute airports. Specifically, during mission planning, reference the Notice to
   Airman (NOTAMS), Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Supplement and FLIP AP1, for
   information on bird activity/BASH procedures (and/or contact the destination airport by
   phone). Additionally, the US Bird Avoidance Model Program (BAM) is located at
   www.usahas.com/bam/. The BAM program allows the user to get bird activity trend data
   for the intended area of flight. Airborne monitor the intended destinations ATIS, and contact
   the airport’s base operations and/or Air Traffic Control for bird advisories.
6.9. Detachment 1, 125 FW BWC Procedures:
   6.9.1. BWC SEVERE: Cancel local flying unless mission essential. Detachment
   Commander or 125th Operations Group/Commander (125 OG/CC) approval is required to
   fly. Airborne aircraft will hold until BWC condition improves or fuel condition requires
   recovery via a single ship, full stop landing. The Alert force will be placed on “mandatory
   scramble” status. Note: Mandatory scramble status requires Southeast Air Defense Sector
   Director of Operations (DO) approval to personally approve scramble. Aircrew risk
   assessment re-evaluation is required.
   6.9.2. BWC MODERATE: Restrict operations to single ship takeoff and recovery. No low
   approaches or formation takeoffs permitted. Avoid bird concentrations during departure and
   recovery. Aircrew risk assessment re-evaluation is required.
6.10. Department of Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection. Department of
Homeland Security Customs and Border Protection, Miami Air and Marine Branch BWC
Procedures:
   6.10.1. BWC SEVERE: Only mission essential flights will be conducted. Operations
   during MODERATE or SEVERE will be conducted only with the specific authorization of
   the Air and Marine Branch Duty Officer. Aircrew risk assessment re-evaluation is required.
   6.10.2. BWC MODERATE: Normal departures and recoveries will be conducted. Local
   flying will be restricted unless specifically authorized by the Command Duty Officer.
   Aircrew risk assessment re-evaluation is required.
6.10.3. Receipt of BWC is advisory in nature only through the ATIS message. Flight operations
will be conducted at the discretion of the USCS IAW USCS Aviation Operations handbook and
applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Regulations.
6.11. Civilian Aviation BWC Procedures: Civilian traffic utilizing HARB will be governed
by FAA Regulations. BWCs will be advisory in nature to Civilian traffic. The pilot in command
of the aircraft is directly responsible for and is the final authority for the operations of their
aircraft.
