OPR: HQ USAF/DPCX (Jack G. Flowers)                  Certified by: HQ USAF/DPC (Mr John R. Graham)
Supersedes AFI 36-105, 28 January 1994.                                                     Pages: 2
                                                                                     Distribution: F

This instruction implements AFPD 36-1, General Civilian Personnel Provisions and Authorities. It
directs civilian personnel flights (CPF) to service activities outside of their own organization. The objec-
tive of a servicing CPF is to provide comparable services to all customers as described in AFI 36-104,
Operating The Civilian Personnel Flight.
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This publication substantially revises AFR 40-105. It minimizes the use of intra-service agreements and
requires that all agreements negotiated by major commands (MAJCOM) be approved by HQ USAF/
DPCX.



1. Personnel Servicing Arrangements. There are two basic types of civilian personnel servicing
arrangements. These are intra-Air Force and inter-agency arrangements. Only the inter-agency arrange-
ments require a written personnel servicing agreement. All written personnel servicing agreements must
be approved by HQ USAF/DPCX.
   1.1. Intra-Air Force Personnel Servicing Arrangements. All Air Force civilian employees must
   be serviced by an Air Force CPF to make sure all are included in the Air Force Civilian Personnel Pro-
   gram. All Air Force activities collocated on an Air Force installation with a CPF, or in the same local-
   ity, must be serviced by that CPF. When an activity is not collocated, or near a CPF, services must be
   provided by the nearest CPF. Exceptions must be referred to HQ USAF/DPCX for resolution.
   1.2. Inter-Agency Personnel Arrangements . Air Force officials must be receptive to other Depart-
   ment of Defense (DoD) components and agencies requesting servicing by Air Force CPFs.
   Inter-agency personnel servicing agreements must identify the activity to be serviced and its location
   and approximate number of employees. Also, any special responsibilities of the serviced and servic-
   ing activities must be defined. The staffing authorized and the reimbursement arrangements should be
   negotiated locally. All servicing agreements must be reviewed every 3 years by the servicing and ser-
   viced activities. Functional responsibilities for personnel servicing arrangements are as follows:
       •   HQ USAF/DPCX negotiates inter-agency personnel servicing agreements when Air Force
           CPFs of more than one MAJCOM is involved.
       •   The MAJCOM Director of Civilian Personnel, on behalf of the Commander, makes
           inter-agency personnel servicing agreements when Air Force CPFs of only their command are
           involved. These agreements must be consistent with DoD Directive 1400.16, Inter-Depart-
           mental Civilian Administration Support, October 30, 1970, with Change 1 and coordinated
           with HQ USAF/DPCX before final approval.

2. Designation To Act for Appointing Authority. The head of an agency or department cannot dele-
gate the basic authority to effect personnel actions to anyone outside of the agency or department. The
civilian personnel officer who is providing the service to another agency must be designated, not dele-
gated, this authority. This written designation must be by position title and provide for administration of
the total Civilian Personnel Program.
