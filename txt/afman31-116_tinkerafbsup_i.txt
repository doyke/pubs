                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Program Management. This manual implements policy, assigns responsibility and
establishes procedures for motor vehicle traffic supervision on Air Force installations located in
the continental United States (CONUS), outside the continental United States (OCONUS), and
deployed locations, where implemented. This AFMAN provides additional Air Force specific
guidance to complement guidance found in AFI 31-218 (I). The objective of traffic control
programs is the safe and efficient flow of vehicles and pedestrians through reduction of factors
contributing to accidents.
1.2. Responsibilities. Installation Defense Force Commander (DFC). The DFC is the
Installation Commander's principal advisor on issues pertaining to the lawful movement of
personnel and traffic. The DFC exercises staff responsibility for directing, regulating and
controlling traffic, and enforcing installation rules pertaining to traffic control. DFCs assist
traffic engineers by performing traffic control studies to gather information on traffic problems
and use patterns.
1.3. Delegation of Authority. Installation commanders may delegate their responsibilities
under this manual to their vice commanders, mission support commanders or other group
commanders as appropriate and provided the individual does not occupy a position such as law
enforcement which would constitute a conflict of interest. Commanders should coordinate letters
of delegation through their SJAs.
1.3. (TINKERAFB)The authority of the Installation commander for the administration of
the base motor vehicle traffic supervision program is delegated to 72 MSG/CD. The 72
ABW/CC is the final approving authority for any and all amendments to this supplement.

                                     DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges. Each Installation Commander will determine if
international driver’s licenses will be recognized and authorized for use on the installation. Take
into consideration the local (civilian) jurisdiction’s policy on recognition and acceptance of
international driver’s licenses. As a general rule, most CONUS civilian jurisdictions will honor
use of international driver’s licenses for short periods of time by non-resident visitors and
assigned military personnel and dependents. When practical, Installation Commanders should
incorporate local guidance to prevent conflicts and confusion.
2.1. (TINKERAFB)A valid state or international driver’s license satisfies driving privilege
requirements on Tinker AFB. Validity includes any state or federal extensions permissible.
2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
     2.2.1. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism, require Installation
     Commanders to develop instructions and guidance that detail stop, inspection, search and
     impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry gates, to include Air Force
     restricted and controlled areas.
     2.2.2. MAJCOMs responsible for overseas military installations must provide their
     Installation Commanders with written guidelines governing stop, inspection, search and
     impoundment of vehicles. This guidance must reflect host nation agreements and pass
     appropriate legal review. Note: A combatant commander or those commanding unified forces
     may direct guidance covering all installations under their command. In this case, MAJCOMs
     must review those policies before issuing their guidance.
2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath or Urine Tests. This requirement must be outlined as
part of installation newcomers briefings and/or inprocessing of newly assigned personnel. Refer
to AFI 31-218 (I) for specific information.
2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. In addition to those conditions for
impoundment listed in AFI 31-218(I), paragraph 2-3, local situations may arise that require
impoundment. The determination will be made by the Installation Commander or designee.
Installation and unit commanders must view the abandonment of personal property as a
personnel management issue and be diligent in deterring occurrences. Commanders must include
the consequences when personal property is abandoned during familiarization and indoctrination
training into units. Additionally, measures must be established to ensure personal effects are
cleared prior to personnel departing on permanent change-of-station orders.
     2.4.1. (Added-TINKERAFB) Any vehicle on Tinker AFB which displays obvious
     disrepair, mechanical defects, expired state registration or is parked for more than 3 days on a
     public street, roadway or public parking area without being moved will have a DD Form
     2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice, placed on it. The 72d Security Forces Squadron will
     attempt to notify the registered owner, owner’s unit or civilian supervisor after placement of
     the notice. The vehicle will be considered abandoned 72 hours after the placement of the
     notice and the vehicle will be towed at the owner’s expense if contact cannot be made.
AFMAN31-116_TINKERAFBSUP_I 23 JANUARY 2014                                                      7


   2.4.2. (Added-TINKERAFB) In addition to the stated reasons for implied consent to
   vehicle impoundment in AFI 31-218, the following violations are considered a threat to
   public safety or convenience and may warrant the towing or impounding of a vehicle.
   Reasonable efforts will be made to have the owner or other designated person move the
   vehicle prior to impoundment. All vehicles impounded on Tinker AFB will be stored at the
   impounding agency’s lot and the owner will pay all applicable charges and fees. Impounding
   rates and fees will be charged in accordance with the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety
   publication Oklahoma Agencies & Commissions (OAC) 595:25. EXCEPTION: Vehicles
   seized by 72 SFS, Investigations Section, or other agency authorized by the Chief of Security
   Forces (CSF), or which are involved in a crime will be stored in the 72 SFS impound lot.
      2.4.2.1. (Added-TINKERAFB) Driving Under Suspension.
      2.4.2.2. (Added-TINKERAFB) Driving Under Revocation.
      2.4.2.3. (Added-TINKERAFB) Operating a vehicle without physical proof of
      insurance verification form in the vehicle (OK Title 47 Ch 7-606).
      2.4.2.4. (Added-TINKERAFB) Driving Under the Influence.
      2.4.2.5. (Added-TINKERAFB) Mission necessity.
      2.4.2.6. (Added-TINKERAFB) Accident where the vehicle is inoperable or the owner
      refuses to have it moved.
      2.4.2.7. (Added-TINKERAFB) Suspicious vehicles or vehicles presenting a force
      protection concern when the owner cannot be contacted.
   2.4.3. (Added-TINKERAFB) Repossessing POVs. Any person, company or business
   requesting to repossess a vehicle on Tinker AFB will be directed to 72 SFS/S2I. The
   requester will furnish legal documents to the 72 SFS for examination. If the agency or
   person does not have a court order to repossess the vehicle, the requester will be informed
   that repossession will only take place with the mutual consent of the registered owner of the
   vehicle. If the registered owner refuses to release the vehicle, the requester will be directed
   to leave Tinker AFB until a court order to repossess the vehicle is obtained.
   2.4.4. (Added-TINKERAFB) Expired State Registration Tags/License Plates. There is no
   grace period for expired vehicle registration tags (state license plates) on Tinker AFB, if the
   vehicle state registration tag is more than 90 days the vehicle may be impounded.
   EXCEPTION: Personnel returning from deployed status (not more than 2 weeks after
   return).
2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges. Installation Commanders must
incorporate procedures governing suspension and revocation in base publications or as a
supplement to this instruction. Make these known to the base population. AF will follow the
administrative due process for suspensions detailed in AFI 31-218(I).
   2.5.1. Suspensions.
      2.5.1.1. Installation Commanders determine suspension and revocation guidance for non-
      moving violations, as well as what constitutes a non-moving violation on their
      installation (i.e., performing unauthorized repair; failure to register and insure vehicles;
      unauthorized modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc).
 8                                 AFMAN31-116_TINKERAFBSUP_I 23 JANUARY 2014


       Make these standards part of the local installation traffic code and take reasonable steps
       to make them known to the general public.
       2.5.1.2. Persons under the age of 21, when in the United States or where legal alcohol
       consumption age is 21, operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC level standard of
       .01 or higher is reason for automatic suspension. Refer to AFI 31-218(I) 2-
       4.a.(3).(a).(b).(c).(d). for additional guidance.

4.2. Traffic Accident Investigation.
   4.2.1. A major traffic accident is any accident involving a fatality, injury or property damage
   above the amount established by Installation Commanders. Installation Commanders may set
   differing amounts for government versus private vehicle and property damage. Monetary
   damage amounts for major accidents are typically $10,000. The investigation of major
   accidents should be accomplished by a trained accident investigator. MAJCOMs will
   determine the level of training required.
AFMAN31-116_TINKERAFBSUP_I 23 JANUARY 2014                                                     19


   4.2.2. Generally, a detailed accident investigation includes, but is not limited to, an AF Form
   1315, Accident Report, field sketch, scale diagram (if death or serious bodily harm), and
   accident narrative.
   4.2.3. (Added-TINKERAFB) All motor vehicle accidents will be reported to the 72 SFS
   BDOC, 734-3737 within 24 hours. Failure to report an accident subjects one or both parties
   to a possible citation. For the purpose of accident investigations by Security Forces on Tinker
   AFB, motor vehicle equipment designated primarily for off-road operations (special purpose
   vehicles) will be classified as ground equipment and accidents will be reported as industrial
   accidents if they occur off the highway. Industrial accidents will not be recorded on an AF
   Form 1315, Accident Report. Accidents involving ground equipment that occur on highways
   are traffic accidents and will be recorded on an AF Form 1315. The 72 ABW/SE will be
   notified of accidents involving government property or personal injury on Tinker AFB.
   4.2.4. (Added-TINKERAFB) A major accident is defined as an accident involving injury,
   fatality and/or property damage of $10,000 or more. A Security Forces Accident Investigator
   will respond to the scene of the accident and conduct an investigation. A copy of the
   Oklahoma Operators Collision and Financial Responsibility Report will be issued to drivers
   involved in accidents to comply with Oklahoma law. Security Forces will ensure that all
   pertinent information is exchanged between drivers.
   4.2.5. (Added-TINKERAFB) All minor accidents involving any vehicles on base will be
   reported to the 72 SFS BDOC, at 743-3737, as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours
   after the accident. Fault will not be determined or tickets issued by 72 SFS personnel in
   minor accidents. Responding Security Forces personnel will complete AFMC Form 625,
   Minor Traffic Accident Work Sheets, for all minor vehicle accidents. An exchange of
   information between the parties involved will occur in accordance with Oklahoma law at the
   time of the accident.
   4.2.6. (Added-TINKERAFB) All accident reports will contain seatbelt use and airbag
   deployment.
4.3. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
   4.3.1. Military members report information to Security Forces if they are on/off base
   resulting in accidents involving injuries or damage to military property. Local guidance will
   capture procedures to accomplish these notifications and the timeframes to report.
   Installation Commanders determine what agencies to notify and for what type of accidents to
   notify them. The DFC must develop a local notification matrix or other procedures to ensure
   proper notification of appropriate base and civilian agencies are conducted. Develop and
   publish these notification procedures locally.
   4.3.1. (TINKERAFB) Military members and government civilians must report information
   to Security Forces if they are on/off base resulting in accidents involving injuries or damage
   to military property not later than the next duty day.
   4.3.2. Security Forces will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident information
   of military affiliated personnel. Record the information in the Security Forces blotter, along
   with the associated case number from the investigating police agency. When possible,
   Security Forces Reports and Analysis (S5R) will obtain copies of major accident reports
 20                                 AFMAN31-116_TINKERAFBSUP_I 23 JANUARY 2014


   prepared by investigating civilian police agencies to accompany off-base accident reporting
   information.
   4.3.3. Security Forces respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents (unless local conditions
   or policies prohibit) to accomplish the following:
      4.3.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
      4.3.3.2. Protect personal property.
      4.3.3.3. Normalize traffic.
      4.3.3.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
      4.3.3.5. Conduct a formal investigation.
      4.3.3.6. The DFC (with Installation Commander approval) will develop local response
      and investigative procedures for various types of accidents to include minor vehicle
      accidents. S/He may delegate this authority to on-duty Security Forces supervisory
      personnel.
   4.3.4. Record accident information in the Security Forces blotter. This information should
   include the accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit (or
   address when civilian not affiliated with military), vehicle description and license
   number(s)/plate. Also, include a brief summary of any damage and circumstances behind or
   causing the accident, as well as any traffic citations issued.
   4.3.5. Investigation conducted by Security Forces and/or AFOSI of any traffic accident will
   take precedence over any other types of investigations relating to the accident. This
   precludes the loss of any potential evidence that may later have to be introduced in any
   criminal/judicial proceedings. (Example: Any safety related investigation and/or any other
   investigation that may hamper accident investigation practices by Security Forces and/or
   AFOSI.)
4.4. Parking.
   4.4.1. Reserved Parking. When not addressed by MAJCOMs, Installation Commanders
   determine reserved parking guidance for their installations. Number of available spaces,
   facility design and layout, traffic flow and number of vehicles using facilities will help
   determine the number and location of reserved parking spaces. Make guidance and
   procedures governing reserved parking a part of the installation supplement to this
   instruction, separate traffic control instruction or installation-parking plan. The publication
   must address approval, issue, control and review of reserved parking and should give special
   consideration to bicycle, motorcycle, visitor and car pool parking. Consideration should also
   be given to labor and management contracts when designating parking. Handicap parking is
   regulated under the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards and applies to all Air Force
   installations.
   4.4.2. Use distinctive emblems, decals, stickers, etc, to control parking space assignments
   and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. MAJCOMs (or Installation Commanders if
   not addressed by the MAJCOM) may develop guidance concerning the issue and control of
   the identification media discussed above. Designation of parking spaces by name, grade, rank
   or title should be avoided due to force protection concerns.
AFMAN31-116_TINKERAFBSUP_I 23 JANUARY 2014                                                  21


     4.4.2.1. (Added-TINKERAFB) The 72 ABW Traffic Safety Working Group (TSWG)
     is responsible for reviewing safety issues concerning mass parking plans and reserved
     parking spaces. The OPR for the TSWG is 72 ABW/SE and is chaired by the 72
     MSG/CD.
     4.4.2.2. (Added-TINKERAFB) For reserved parking spaces on Staff Drive, Bldg 3001,
     coordination must be initially routed through AFSC/DSH then to the TSWG for approval
     before any changes can be made.
     4.4.2.3. (Added-TINKERAFB) For reserved parking spaces in other areas on Tinker
     AFB, coordination with the 72 ABW/CE must be approved before any changes can be
     made. The requesting organization must generate an AF Form 332 stating the requested
     changes. The AF Form 332s will be reviewed by 72 ABW/CE for approval/disapproval.
     72 ABW/CE will limit reserved parking spaces to no more than 10% of available parking
     spaces (does not include handicap parking).
     4.4.2.4. (Added-TINKERAFB) Community Activity Centers (i.e. Commissary,
     AAFES, etc.) if used will be proportionately distributed and designated by title:
        4.4.2.4.1. (Added-TINKERAFB) General
        4.4.2.4.2. (Added-TINKERAFB) O-6
        4.4.2.4.3. (Added-TINKERAFB) CMSgt
        4.4.2.4.4. (Added-TINKERAFB) Maternity
        4.4.2.4.5. (Added-TINKERAFB) Parents with Small Children

        4.4.2.4.7. (Added-TINKERAFB) Team Tinker Award Winner
     4.4.2.5. (Added-TINKERAFB) Quarterly and Annual Base Award Winners will
     receive a parking decal to be placed on their dashboard, when parking in the Team Tinker
     Award Winner parking spot at the Exchange or Commissary. The decal must be
     prominently displayed at all times when parked in the reserved spot.
     4.4.2.6. (Added-TINKERAFB) Sign Manufacturing. 72 ABW/CE is approval authority
     for procuring reserved parking signs and will procure all reserved parking signs to ensure
     uniformity unless CE expressly approves off-base procurement through local
     manufacturers due to workload or time constraints. Either method requires strict
     adherence to CE standards.
     4.4.2.7. (Added-TINKERAFB) Units must fill out an AF Form 332 and forward to 72
     CE.
     4.4.2.8. (Added-TINKERAFB) Tinker units will review reserved parking for
     compliance with this instruction on the first day of the fiscal year. All signs not in
     compliance will be immediately removed by owner/user.
     4.4.2.9. (Added-TINKERAFB) Organizations will designate reserved parking by
     numerical digits or by unit designator and office symbol or approved posted signs. All
     organizations may designate reserved parking spots for personnel assigned to or who
     frequent their facility and will include:
22                               AFMAN31-116_TINKERAFBSUP_I 23 JANUARY 2014


        4.4.2.9.1. (Added-TINKERAFB) General/Senior Executive Service.
        4.4.2.9.2. (Added-TINKERAFB) Wing Commander/Vice Commander.
        4.4.2.9.3. (Added-TINKERAFB) Group Commander/Deputy Commander.
        4.4.2.9.4. (Added-TINKERAFB) Colonel or civilian equivalent.
        4.4.2.9.5. (Added-TINKERAFB) Squadron Commander.
        4.4.2.9.6. (Added-TINKERAFB) Command CMSgt/Senior Enlisted Manager.
        4.4.2.9.7. (Added-TINKERAFB) First Sergeant.
        4.4.2.9.8. (Added-TINKERAFB) Government Vehicle.
        4.4.2.9.9. (Added-TINKERAFB) Handicap Parking.
        4.4.2.9.10. (Added-TINKERAFB) Customer Service (1 hour).

        4.4.2.9.12. (Added-TINKERAFB) Motorcycle and Loading Zone.
  4.4.3. Installations may create a parking wardens program to monitor and cite parking
  violators at their facilities.
     4.4.3.1. If utilized, installations will develop a local publication to
     supplement/implement this instruction addressing the parking warden program. The
     supplement will include a requirement for individual unit commanders to delegate a
     minimum of one primary and alternate at the grade of E-5 or above, in writing. All
     monitors will issue parking tickets on the DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket.
     S5R will obtain a letter with the current monitors and maintain the letter on file.
     4.4.3.2. Monitors will be trained by the Security Forces unit on the correct procedures to
     complete tickets, including the routing process of issued tickets to S5R. The main
     difference between a DD Form 1408 issued by a Security Forces member and one by a
     parking monitor is the special instructions on the back of the pink copy that directs the
     violator to contact the monitor within 24 hours or next duty day who issued the ticket
     instead of Security Forces. Monitors will provide contact information on parking tickets
     to enable violators to provide information necessary to complete the citation.
     4.4.3.3. (Added-TINKERAFB) Monitors will be trained by the Security Forces unit on
     the correct procedures to complete tickets, including the routing process of issued tickets
     to S5R. The main difference between a DD Form 1408 issued by a Security Forces
     member and one by a parking monitor is the special instructions on the back of the pink
     copy that directs the violator to contact the monitor within 24 hours or next duty day who
     issued the ticket instead of Security Forces. Monitors will provide contact information on
     parking tickets to enable violators to provide information necessary to complete the
     ticket. Tickets must be forwarded to 72 SFS/S5R within 72 hours of issue. 72 MSG/CD
     reserves the right to remove a parking warden if the individual fails to adequately
     perform those duties.
  4.4.4. (Added-TINKERAFB) 72 SFS will move or cause to be moved a parked vehicle
  when the vehicle:
AFMAN31-116_TINKERAFBSUP_I 23 JANUARY 2014                                                   23

     movement area.
     4.4.4.7. (Added-TINKERAFB) Is being repaired in an unauthorized area.
     4.4.4.8. (Added-TINKERAFB) Vehicles parked near aircraft runway take-off and
     landing glide paths will be moved immediately.
  4.4.5. (Added-TINKERAFB) Parking spaces are designated by white stripes. Areas not
  marked specifically for parking are considered no parking. Parking on the grass is
  prohibited, unless otherwise posted. Parking in a reserved parking space by any person
  whose vehicle does not bear the appropriate parking decal/placard is prohibited.
     4.4.5.1. (Added-TINKERAFB) Spaces with a series of narrow white lines at the ends
     of parking rows such as present at Bldg 3001, Bldg 820 and others are designated
     turning-radius buffers for larger vehicles and are not motorcycle parking spaces marked
     by ground paint or elevated signage.
     4.4.5.2. (Added-TINKERAFB) Management of Parking Areas. The 72 ABW/CE is
     responsible for assigning and authorizing the marking of specific parking areas and
     spaces. The establishment of parking areas/spaces will be coordinated with the 72
     ABW/CE. Any changes beyond 10 per month in a parking area will be negotiated with
     the union.
     4.4.5.3. (Added-TINKERAFB) 72 ABW/CE will coordinate with 72 SFS and 72
     ABW/SE on construction projects affecting traffic flow and vehicle parking.
     4.4.5.4. (Added-TINKERAFB) Handicap parking permits are issued by the respective
     state, not Tinker AFB. All requests for handicap parking permits will be made through
     the State. Tinker AFB will honor valid handicap parking permits and decals regardless of
     the state of issue. The handicap permit must be registered to the person using it. Vehicles
     displaying a handicap-parking permit may park in any space designated as such unless
     otherwise restricted. A handicap placard does not entitle the user to park in other
     reserved spaces such as carpool or reserved, even if all available handicap spaces have
     been filled.
     4.4.5.5. (Added-TINKERAFB) Government Vehicle Parking. Government vehicles
     may be parked in spaces designated for government vehicles or customer service
     provided that the size of the parking space will accommodate the vehicle. Time limits
     must be observed when using time limit spaces. Temporary parking for government
     vehicles may be authorized when mission requirements dictate (to load or unload material
     or equipment). Such parking will not be abused.

                                            Chapter 6

                     IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. Standards for Impoundment. The on-duty SF Flight Chief, or above, will determine
when the vehicle will be driven or moved without owner’s consent if the owner cannot be
contacted or the owner refuses and conditions in AFI 31-218(I) are present.
6.2. Procedures for Impoundment. At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government
agencies will request the Air Force impound an on-base vehicle for reasons not related to
military issues. Staff such requests through the SJA and DFC. When appropriate, comply and
support such requests and impound the vehicle for a reasonable period. Release the vehicle if
civil authorities do not take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period as determined by
Installation Commanders.
6.3. Disposition of Vehicles After Impoundment. Impoundment and disposition of privately
owned vehicles is a high-risk process. It is imperative an installation have a detailed plan to:
Ensure wide publicity of base impoundment rules; have a process to provide reasonable notice of
impoundment and an opportunity to reclaim a vehicle; conduct a review of proposed disposal by
appropriate base offices, to include the SJA, prior to taking action; and a process to obtain retail
records of these actions in the event of litigation or high-level inquiry. Further information on
impoundment can be found in AFI 31-218(I).
