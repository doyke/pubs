1. General Information.
     1.1. Introduction. 48th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (48 OSS/OSW)
     provides and arranges weather support for the 48th Fighter Wing (48 FW). Basic concepts
     and procedures are outlined in Air Force and MAJCOM directives listed in Attachment 1.
     This instruction establishes responsibilities and procedures for areas of weather support
     required to support mission needs of the 48 FW.
     1.2. Assumptions. Weather communication networks will function and provide sufficient
     data for the continuity of weather support.
     1.3. 48 OSS/OSW Mission. Provide and/or direct weather support to maximize 48 FW
     effectiveness in all operations.
     1.4. Support. Weather support provided by 48 OSS/OSW is largely driven by the
     requirements of flying operations (listed in Attachment 2) and base agencies (listed in
     Attachment 3).
     1.5. Duty Priorities. 48 OSS/OSW duty priorities are listed on the RAF Lakenheath Weather
     Support Data Sheet.
     1.6. Release of Weather Information. Weather observations, forecasts, and historical
     data/records will be released only to Department of Defense (DoD) agencies or contractors
     under contract to the United States Air Force (USAF). All other agencies and civilians will
     be referred to Public Affairs (48 FW/PA) and/or the Base Freedom of Information Act
LAKENHEATHI15-101 10 OCTOBER 2013                                                              3


   Monitor (48 CS/SCOK) to obtain approval prior to the release of weather observation
   records.
2. Limitations to Weather Services.
   2.1. Interruption of the normal receipt of alphanumeric and graphic data via Joint
   Environmental Toolkit (JET), Nonsecure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) or
   Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) can severely degrade forecasting
   capabilities.
   2.2. Observing site limitations at the primary operating location (Building 1392) include
   limited visual references beyond 5000 meters. In addition, the tower blocks the Runway 06
   approach. At the Alternate Operating Location (AOL), which is the Strike Eagle Complex
   (Building 1319), technicians have fewer visual references but are able to continue to evaluate
   weather conditions.
   2.3. 48 OSS/OSW does not have a weather radar. To compensate, the weather flight uses a
   combination of Air Traffic Control (ATC) radar, data from the 21 OWS, United Kingdom
   (UK) composite radar normally available via NIPRNET, and/or pilot reports (PIREPs) to
   determine if precipitation and/or thunderstorms are within 25 Nautical Miles (NM) of the
   base.
   2.4. RAF Feltwell has no weather personnel or weather sensors. Therefore, in the interest of
   safety and resource protection, weather watches, warnings, and advisories (WWAs) issued
   for RAF Lakenheath are also in effect for RAF Feltwell. The only exception is RAF Feltwell
   and RAF Lakenheath have separate Lightning within 5 NMs watches and warnings.
   2.5. Many flying areas are over unpopulated or water regions. Lack of weather data from
   such areas may limit the weather watch capabilities of the duty forecaster. Pilot reports are
   extremely useful over data sparse areas.
   2.6. Forecasting in the UK is very challenging. The speed at which systems move is difficult
   to track/determine due to the limited amount of data upstream. Keeping this in mind,
   forecasts beyond 24 hours diminish in accuracy, and it is advisable to obtain daily updates
   when possible.
   2.7. Due to local terrain features near the runway, sensor wind speeds between the 06 and 24
   approach ends of the runway may differ by several knots. This is a standard and acceptable
   variance and no corrective action is warranted.
3. Airfield Support Function (ASF).
   3.1. General. All official weather observations at RAF Lakenheath will be taken in
   accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations. 48 OSS/OSW
   operates a FMQ-19, automated observing system, which provides 24 hour observation
   capability. 48 OSS/OSW will be on phone standby on weekends, 48 FW Down Days, and
   US holidays. Deviations to these hours can be made by the Weather Flight Commander, 48
   Operations Support Squadron Commander (48 OSS/CC), 48 Operations Group Commander
   (48 OG/CC), or 48 FW Commander (48 FW/CC) as required to support mission needs. A
   standby member will be subject to recall at all times when the weather station is closed. A
   standby technician may be recalled through the Wing Command Post at DSN 314-226-4800
4                                                LAKENHEATHI15-101 10 OCTOBER 2013


    or the assigned mobile phone and will man the weather station no more than 1 hour after
    being recalled.
    3.2. Types of Observations.
       3.2.1. Record Observations, also called an Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR),
       will be disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-111, Chapter 2, via JET between 55 and 59
       minutes after each hour.
       3.2.2. Special (SPECI) Observations are observations to report significant changes in
       weather elements in accordance with AFMAN 15-111, local policy, to include all
       published minima applicable to RAF Lakenheath as listed in the enroute and terminal
       Flight Information Publication (FLIP). A special observation will be taken and
       disseminated for criteria listed in RAF Lakenheath Weather Support Data Sheet.
       3.2.3. Augmentation is the process of having position-qualified weather technicians
       manually add or edit data to an observation generated by a properly sited AMOS. The
       two augmentation processes used are supplementing and back-up. Supplementing is a
       method of manually adding meteorological information to an automated observation that
       is beyond the capabilities of the AMOS to detect and/or report. An observation will be
       supplemented when any phenomena in Attachment 4 occurs. Back-up is the method of
       manually providing meteorological data and/or dissemination to an AMOS observation
       when the primary automated method is not operational or unavailable due to sensor
       and/or communication failure. A certified observer continuously maintains weather
       situational awareness and is available to augment the AMOS during standard operating
       hours and upon recall during standby hours. During local wing flying, whenever reported
       conditions are unrepresentative and significant to operations/flight safety, the certified
       observer will err on the side of caution for the following criteria:
           3.2.3.1. Unrepresentative sky coverage for layers less than or equal to 2000 feet, to
           include BKN-OVC ceilings.
           3.2.3.2. Unrepresentative visibility when apparent visibility is 5000 meters or less.
           3.2.3.3. Type of precipitation when the FMQ-19 is reporting the incorrect type.
    3.3. Observation Site. The primary AMOS observation site is the active runway sensor
    group. The augmented observation site is the roof platform on building 1392.
       3.3.1. Due to duty priorities (e.g. processing and disseminating weather data), some
       weather changes may not be immediately detected and reported exactly when they occur.
       To offset this, air traffic controllers are trained and expected to assist by way of a
       Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW) to alert 48 OSS/OSW of significant weather
       changes that occur between scheduled observations. This is detailed in paragraphs 3.5.
       and 8.14.3.
       3.3.2. If the primary observation site is non-operational, or the technician has to evacuate
       building 1392, observations will be taken from the AOL. Building 1319 is the primary
       AOL. However, if Building 1319 is unsafe or inaccessible, any location with a view of
       the airfield complex, a telephone, and access to the base LAN may be used as an AOL in
       an emergency. Observations made from an AOL might contain estimated elements, such
       as winds and pressure. The primary means of dissemination at the AOL is JET, but email
LAKENHEATHI15-101 10 OCTOBER 2013                                                             5


      and/or telephone may be used. If email is used, observations will be sent to the
      48OSS/OSAR, 48OSS/OSA, 21OWS/OPS org boxes, and the on-duty SOF. Contact
      information for the AOL can be located on RAF Lakenheath Weather Support Data
      Sheet.
   3.4. Dissemination.
      3.4.1. JET is the primary weather communication tool for ATC.
      3.4.2. Telephones and hotlines are a secondary method used to disseminate weather data
      when JET is off-line. When using voice communication as a backup means, observations
      will be sent to ATC agencies (i.e. Tower, RAPCON, AMOPS) first.
      3.4.3. E-mail via base NIPRNET LAN is used as a tertiary means to disseminate weather
      data.
   3.5. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). ATC personnel assist the weather ASF technician
   by participating in cooperative weather watch. The ASF technician in turn will incorporate
   this data in the official observation when applicable. The ASF technician is the final
   authority for all information included in the official observation. Of primary concern is the
   report of lightning, tower visibility less than 6000 meters and different from the prevailing
   surface visibility, local PIREPS (within 5 minutes of notification), and any occurrence of
   previously unreported weather conditions that could affect flight safety or local operations.
      3.5.1. Weather technicians will reevaluate weather conditions whenever ATC or reliable
      sources such as pilots, local law enforcement, etc., report weather conditions different
      from the last disseminated observation. The ASF technician will generate a SPECI
      (special) observation if required or include information in the next METAR observation
      if required.
      3.5.2. 48 OSS/OSW leadership will assist tower personnel in creating appropriate guides
      to perform CWW. This will include day and night visibility marker guides as well as a
      listing of all SPECI observation criteria. This information will be reviewed annually by
      weather leadership or whenever significant changes occur.
      3.5.3. See paragraph 8.15 of this document for additional obligations between 48
      OSS/OSW and 48th Operations Support Squadron Airfield Operations Flight (48
      OSS/OSA).
   3.6. Climatological Support. Requests for climatological data and studies should be sent to
   48 OSS/OSW Flight Commander.
4. Mission Integration Function (MIF).
   4.1. General. 48 OSS/OSW and the 21 OWS provide services in concert.
   4.2. 48 OSS/OSW. Maintains a limited duty weather station. The 48 OSS/OSW is primarily
   responsible for MEFs and assisting the 21 OWS with Resource Protection at RAF
   Lakenheath. The MEF consists of the Flimsy posted on the 48 OSS/OSW ICE page in
   conjunction with a verbal brief to the aircrew or squadron Top-3.
      4.2.1. Normal duty hours for services are 2300L on Sunday through the end of local
      flying on Friday. 48 OSS/OSW is on standby on weekends, 48 FW Down Days and US
      holidays. Outside of normal duty hours, contact the 21 OWS at DSN 489-2134/2138 or
 6                                               LAKENHEATHI15-101 10 OCTOBER 2013


        access the OWS web page at https://ows.sembach.af.mil/ for weather service.
        Deviations to these hours can be made by the 48 OSS/OSW Commander, 48 OSS/CC, 48
        OG/CC, or the 48 FW/CC.
        4.2.2. A standby technician will be subject to recall at all times when the weather station
        is closed and subject to guidance in section 3.1. The standby 48 OSS/OSW technician
        may be recalled through the Wing Command Post at DSN 226-4800.
     4.3. 21 OWS. The 21 OWS is open 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. The 21 OWS issues
     all Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs), all WWAs (including observed advisories when
     the 48 OSS/OSW is closed), and performs a continuous meteorological watch
     (METWATCH) for RAF Lakenheath.
     4.4. Communication. If a communication outage occurs at the 21 OWS or between the 21
     OWS and the 48 FW, then 48 OSS/OSW assumes all METWATCH, TAF, and resource
     protection responsibility at RAF Lakenheath until communication is restored and the OWS
     again accepts METWATCH and resource protection responsibility.
5. 21 OWS Forecasting Services.
     5.1. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs). The TAF is an operational level forecast
     geared to aviation support. The TAF is valid for areas within a five-NM radius of the center
     of the aerodrome. The Lakenheath (EGUL) TAF is prepared and issued by the 21 OWS and
     is used to construct the MEF. TAFs will normally be issued at 0400Z, 1200Z and 2000Z.
        5.1.1. All TAFs produced for RAF Lakenheath will be constructed in IAW AFMAN 15-
        129 Volume 1, Chapter 3 and AFMAN 15-124, Chapter 1.
        5.1.2. TAF specification and amendment criteria can be found in the RAF Lakenheath
        Weather Support Data Sheet.
        5.1.3. Examples of TAFs can be found in AFMAN 15-124, Chapter 1.
     5.2. Dissemination.
        5.2.1. JET is the primary system used for air traffic control when disseminating TAFs.
        5.2.2. Air Force Weather Web Services (AFW-WEBS), the telephone, and e-mail are
        used as secondary methods to disseminate the TAF when JET is off-line.
6. Forecasting Services and Specialized Support.
     6.1. Local MEF. A local MEF consists of two parts: the Flimsy, a planning document
     produced daily to support local flying; and a verbal brief provided to each aircrew or
     squadron Top-3 based on individual mission weather thresholds. These two parts in
     conjunction are the equivalent of a DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing, prescribed by
     AFMAN 15-129 Volume 2, Air and Space Weather Operations—Exploitation.
        6.1.1. Briefing Procedures. The local Flimsy is disseminated via the 48 FW ICE page
        with the first Flimsy issued five hours prior to first takeoff. The 48 FW ICE page also
        contains links to current observations and forecasts for all alternate airfields.
            6.1.1.1. Attachment 5 is an example of the Flimsy. Due to continuous upgrades to
            technology and mission requirements, the content or format of the Flimsy may be
            changed whenever new information/technologies are deemed significant to operations
LAKENHEATHI15-101 10 OCTOBER 2013                                                                7


        or deemed obsolete. The 48 OSS/OSW Flight Commander will coordinate changes
        with the 48 OSS/CC, 492/493/494 Fighter Squadron Commanders (FS/CCs) and the
        56 Rescue Squadron Commander (RQS/CC) before changes to content or format are
        made.
        6.1.1.2. Aircrew or duty desk will call the weather station at 226-4184 to receive a
        finalized flight brief prior to departure. If a forecaster is available at the operations
        desk within the flying unit, aircrew will receive an in person finalized flight brief
        prior to departure. This brief completes the MEF and will be delivered by phone,
        email, fax or in person and will be documented by the duty forecaster. If the TAF is
        different than the forecast given in the MEF, the MEF should be used to determine
        airfield status and if an alternate airfield is required. Differences in the forecasts will
        not cross operational thresholds unless a time constraint prevents coordination
        between 48 OSS/OSW and 21 OWS.
     6.1.2. Area of Operation. Local flying is defined as flying in England, Wales, Scotland,
     the North Sea and the Dutch coast, as depicted by the Low Fly Areas, Air-to-Air
     Refueling Areas, and UK Air Defense Airspace Depiction in the 48 FW In-Flight Guide.
     6.1.3. Updates to MEFs. Updates to each MEF will be communicated to aircrew or
     squadron Top-3s prior to aircrew step brief time. However, all aircrew are welcome at
     any time to contact the weather technician at 226-4184 for additional information,
     clarification, or to request a formal brief.
     6.1.4. Amendments. The MEF will be amended IAW AFMAN 15-129 Volume 2,
     Chapter 1, and any time it is deemed unrepresentative of the actual or forecast conditions.
     6.1.5. Local Flimsy. The Flimsy consists of pages displayed on the 48 FW ICE page.
     An example of the local Flimsy and the information provided can be found in Attachment
     5. A planning forecast for the following day will also be completed Monday through
     Thursday and posted on the 48 FW ICE page. Included will be a regional breakdown of
     expected UK flying and water areas for the next flying window and graphical computer-
     generated range forecasts.
     6.1.6. MISSIONWATCH. A MISSIONWATCH is conducted by the MIF technician on
     all areas of operations and will use Operational Risk Management (ORM) to focus on
     daily mission areas to be used by the 48 FW, IAW AFMAN 15-129 Volume 2, Chapter
     2. If the MIF technician determines the need to notify aircrew of weather changes
     discovered during MISSIONWATCH, they will immediately contact the SOF and the
     flying squadron Top-3s, and relay pertinent information to these individuals for possible
     relay to aircrew.
  6.2. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV). 48 OSS/OSW provides PMSV support as listed in the
  FLIP. Weather operates this program IAW AFMAN 15-129 Volume 2, Chapter 3, and uses
  standard phraseology found in Federal Aviation Administration Handbook (FAAH) 7110.10,
  Chapter 14.
     6.2.1. Pilot Reports (PIREPS). It is impossible for ground based weather technicians to
     report the weather that aircrews see or experience while on a mission. Reports of weather
     as observed from airborne aircraft, especially reports of hazards to air operations, are
     therefore very beneficial to forecasters and other aircrews.

       6.2.2. Dissemination of PIREPS. PIREPs will be transmitted locally and longline via
       JET.
    6.3. Electro-Optical (EO) Support. Lakenheath uses an Air Force Weather (AFW) Tactical
    Decision Aid (TDA) program named Target Acquisition Weapons Software (TAWS) to
    generate EOTDA products. This windows-based program computes detection and lock-on

falling and/or blowing snow, with prevailing visibility frequently < ¼ mile/0400 meters.
Desired Lead-time—-The amount of advanced notice a supported agency desires before the
onset of a particular weather phenomenon.
Issue Time—-The time when an agency is notified of a WA, WWTCH, or WW. When more
than one agency is notified, the issue time is the time the last agency is notified. Follow up
notifications are not considered when determining issue time. For RAF Lakenheath, the issue
time is the time the WA, WWTCH, or WW was transmitted on JET.
Limited Duty Station—-A weather station that provides less than 24-hour a day forecast
service.
Meteorological Watch—-Monitoring the weather for a route, area, or terminal and advising
concerned organizations when hazardous conditions that could affect their operations or pose a
hazard to life or property are observed or forecast to occur.
Mission Execution Forecast—-A MEF is the integration of strategic center (AFWA) products,
OWS produced products, and perishable weather data to the supported operator’s/war-fighter’s
weapon system and tactics.
MISSIONWATCH—Monitoring the weather for a route, sortie, or training area and advising
concerned organizations when forecast conditions change past operational thresholds or
hazardous weather conditions that could affect operations or pose a threat to life or property are
observed or forecast to occur.
Operational Weather Squadron—-An organization with regional forecast responsibility. The
organization is comprised of the assigned management, staff, and technical personnel and its
assigned resources. Their mission is to produce fine-scale tailored weather forecast products and
services to customers within their area of responsibility.
Timing Error—-The difference between the forecast time of occurrence and the actual time of
occurrence. The timing error is positive (+) if the event occurred later than forecast and negative
(-) if it occurred earlier than forecast.
Weather Advisory—-A special notice provided to a supported agency when an established
weather condition is occurring that could affect its operation.
Weather Warning—-A special notice provided to supported customers that alerts them of
weather conditions (occurring or expected to occur within 5 NM of the center point of the
runway) of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property.
Weather Watch—A special notice provided to supported customers that alerts them of
conditions favorable for the development (potential) of weather conditions of such intensity as to
pose a hazard to life or property.

Table A2.4. F-15 Hazard Impacts/Sensitivities.
          Hazards                                 Impacts/Sensitivities
Thunderstorms/Lightning Can produce severe weather such as turbulence, icing, hail,
                        updrafts, downdrafts, and heavy precipitation. There is also an
                        increased danger of engine stagnation. Lightning strikes to the
                        aircraft can cause both physical damage and/or affect the aircraft's
                        instrumentation. Avoid by 10 NM below FL250, 20 NM at and
                        above FL250.
         Turbulence        Increased danger of engine stagnation. Can cause structural
                           damage and/or injury to crew. Avoid moderate/severe/extreme.
      Icing (Structural)   Disrupts air flow over the wing, increasing weight and stalling
                           speed--reduces lift and increases drag. Accumulation of ice on
                           exterior movable surfaces affects aircraft control. May penetrate
                           areas of icing but not loiter.
      Icing (Induction)    Inlet lip and engine face icing can occur when the ambient
                           temperature is between 10C (50F) and -20C (-4F) and the dewpoint
                           is within 0 to 3 C (5F) of the ambient temperature. Can cause
                           engine damage to aircraft.

 Freezing Precipitation    Especially critical to F-15C/D/E operations. Causes delays in take-
                           offs due to aircraft de-icing by maintenance. Can also stop flying
                           entirely if widespread. Also causes braking action problems on the
                           runway.

            Snow           Poses braking action problems on the runway. Heavy snowfall can
                           completely stop all operations due to limited snowfall removal
                           equipment. Also affects the F-15E terrain following radar.
