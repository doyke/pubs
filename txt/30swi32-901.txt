                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. By assignment, the Facility Manager: Is ultimately responsible for the facility, for
notifying CES in writing of the using organization’s intent to vacate the facility (see Attachment
2), and for completing a facility turn-in/closure checklist for each building they manage. Obtain
a checklist for each facility you manage from the 30 SW Self-Inspection web page. For
buildings with multiple occupants, each occupant is generally required to complete all applicable
transfer actions for their portion of the facility. An early departing co-occupant may turn the
space over to the remaining building manager without completing a checklist if the building
manager agrees to include that space on the final clearance letter.
1.2. The last organization to vacate the facility has the final responsibility for cleanup. The
keys to the facility may then be turned over to CES. CES will not accept keys until the final
clearance letter (see Attachment 3) has been completely signed off by all functional areas.
1.3. Facility managers submit a notice of intent to vacate to the Real Property Office
(30 CES/CEIAP).
1.4. Provide all pertinent information: On each clearance document, i.e. letter of intent to
vacate and transfer or turn-in clearance letter. Verify that each facility is entered on the
notification letter and that the vacate dates are correct. Verify with the using organization
custodians that the closure and turn-in activities are being accomplished.
1.5. Walk-through briefings. 30 CES/CEIAP will brief facility managers on what the walk-
through process is and what to expect during onsite visits. The walk-through is an onsite
validation that all the activities and actions addressed in the Functional Area Manager’s (FAM)
areas of responsibility have been completed. Facility managers must ensure the facility is ready
for the walk-through; clean and free of debris.
1.6. As the responsible individual working closure and transfer issues: Facility managers
are responsible to identify and contact the following POCs within his or her organization:
   1.6.1. Automated Data –Processing Equipment (ADPE) custodian,
   1.6.2. Accountable and non-accountable equipment custodians,
   1.6.3. Security Manager.
1.7. After contact is made with squadron POCs, facility managers must contact these
FAMs:
   1.7.1. Civil Engineering.
   1.7.2. Communications.
   1.7.3. Logistics Readiness.
   1.7.4. Security Forces.
   1.7.5. Safety.
1.8. When all clearance actions are complete, schedule a walk-through. This should be done
within two (2) weeks. The purpose of the walk-through is to conduct an onsite validation of the
 4                                                                  30SWI 32-901 14 MAY 2014


completion of the actions and activities listed in the facility turn-in/closure checklist. Mandatory
attendees at the walk-through are the facility manager and a 30 CES/CEIAP representative.
Afterwards, resolve any open items.
1.9. Representatives from each of the functional areas listed in this instruction, except Base
Supply will: Conduct onsite visits to ensure that clearance activities have been accomplished
prior to the walk-through. The facility manager or equipment custodian will contact the
Equipment Management Unit at base supply and coordinate turn-in of assets listed on his or her
unit’s Custodian Authorization/Customer Receipt List (CA/CRL) or items purchased through
Base Supply. Items purchased via the Government Purchase Card (GPC) will be turned in
directly through the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Organization (DRMO). Base supply
will process and coordinate pick up of CA/CRL or base supply assets with the facility manager
or equipment custodians.
1.10. When items are found to be incomplete at the walk-through: Facility managers are
required to follow-up with the functional area in question. Ideally, within two weeks after the
walk-through open actions are completed. All incomplete actions annotated at the walk-through
must be completed prior to final signoff of the clearance letter. If there is difficulty meeting the
2-week timeframe, contact 30 CES/CEIAP and provide an estimate as to when you will be
complete. 30 CES/CEIAP will be the last to sign the clearance letter and accept the facility into
caretaker status. After acceptance of the facility, 30 CES/CEIAP will archive the clearance
letter.
