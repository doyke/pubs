SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is the second publication of AFSPCI 99-103. The guidance in this document
substantially revises previous direction; therefore this new document must be completely
reviewed. New guidance addresses AFSPC-specific processes for the following: requirements
for integrated test planning; early tester involvement; test prioritization process; formation of
Integrated Test Teams (ITT); and tester roles in the requirements development process. The
method for requesting and tasking AFSPC test assets has been substantially changed. Test and
Evaluation Master Plans (TEMP), Life Cycle Management Plans (LCMP), ITT charters and test
report format, content, coordination and approval requirements are being modified to align with
current AF requirements and standardized for both Cyberspace and Space applications. Test
Readiness Review Board (TRRB) and Detailed Test Plan approval and coordination is assigned
in accordance with (IAW) decisions supported or risk acceptance levels. Director of
Developmental Test and Evaluation was established in Public Law 111-23-S. 454 Chapter 4 of
Title 10, United States Code enacted 22 May 2009. Additionally, the transition of the
Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) mission to Air Force Global Strike Command and the
incorporation of the cyberspace mission into AFSPC have created the need for responsibilities to
be modified or deleted as applicable and new concepts specific to cyberspace testing to be
addressed.

                                            Chapter 1

                      VISION AND IMPLEMENTATION CONCEPTS

1.1. AFSPC Approach to Test and Evaluation (T&E). Collaboration and Early Tester
Involvement: These two concepts are the cornerstones to achieving “Capabilities Based T&E”
for Space and Cyberspace Systems. Even before an Integrated Test Team (ITT) is formed, testers
should be involved early on in all acquisition and sustainment programs or projects to infuse
testability and operational realism into requirements development while ensuring test assets and
resources will be available to evaluate the potential capability. This includes commercial off-the-
shelf (COTS) software and hardware, Government off-the-shelf (GOTS), non-developmental
items (NDI), potential form-fit-function-interface changes, modifications, field service
evaluations, shelf life evaluations, source qualifications, and acceptance tests. To the greatest
extent possible Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) organizations will become actively
involved early on in any program or project in order to leverage Developmental Test and
Evaluation (DT&E) activities for any future dedicated OT&E effort. ITTs are critical to the
AFSPC approach to test. They are cross-functional teams of empowered representatives from
multiple disciplines and organizations, co-chaired by operational testers and program
management representatives. Through early involvement, ITT coordination and an integrated test
strategy, the operational test (OT) organization and end user will benefit from reduced costs and
more timely and relevant acquisition decisions. In accordance with AFSPCI 10-604, Space
Operations Weapon System Management, the policy of AFSPC is to make operational use of
new and modified systems at the earliest possible time, in order to maximize their military utility
and the return on our national investment. AFSPC T&E processes include: identification,
assessment, assignment, planning, execution and reporting of test activities. Additionally, testers
must be knowledgeable of capability gaps, which are identified via involvement with
USAF/A5R’s capabilities requirements process as outlined in AFI 10-601, Capabilities Based
Requirements Development, and participation on their High Performance Teams (HPT).
1.2. Scope. This instruction provides policy and guidance to AFSPC units conducting or
supporting DT&E and/or OT&E of space and cyberspace systems or providing test expertise to
related activities. Unless required for clarity, this instruction will not repeat guidance found
in the governing instructions listed above. The processes described herein are linked to
acquisition or modification processes; therefore, this instruction must be used in conjunction
with instructions governing those processes. This instruction does not cover programs exempted
from AFI 99-103 nor activities governed by DoDD 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base
(MRTFB), unless those programs themselves are AFSPC activities. Additionally, this instruction
does not apply to developmental activities such as Technology Demonstrations, Flight
Experiments, or other Research and Development (R&D) activities. Questions on applicability
should be directed to HQ AFSPC/A3J (Test and Evaluation (T&E)) Command Lead (CL).
1.3. Approach to Developmental Testing. AFSPC systems are acquired by two Product
Centers: the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) and the Electronic Systems Center (ESC).
The SMC Commander (SMC/CC) is the AF Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Space and the
ESC/CC is the AF PEO for Command and Control & Combat Support Systems (AFPEO/C2 &
CS). AFSPC Cyberspace products are managed within ESC by the PEO for Cyber and
Netcentric programs. As such, these PEOs have acquisition responsibility to include directing
AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010                                                                      7


DT&E and facilitating integrated testing. DT&E is conducted throughout the acquisition and
sustainment processes to assist in engineering design and development, and to verify that Critical
Technical Parameters (CTP) have been achieved. DT&E supports the acquisition of materiel or
operational capabilities before Full-Rate Production (FRP) or fielding decisions. After FRP or
fielding, DT&E supports the sustainment of systems to extend their useful life, performance, and
capabilities. Where mission capability testing is not feasible or practical, an exceptions risk
analysis will be performed to identify potential critical flaw escape paths and alternative methods
of risk mitigation. AFSPC also relies on Air Force Material Command (AFMC),e.g., 850 ELSG,
for developmental and sustainment DT&E support for those systems that fall within PEO Space
portfolio and those select systems that fall under AFPEO/C2 & CS (e.g., Space Telemetry,
Tracking and Control (TT&C), space crypto). Inter-command Memorandum of Agreements
(MOA) exist detailing agreed upon support issues and procedures for these systems.
1.4. AFSPC Approach to Operational Testing and Evaluation. HQ AFSPC’s T&E CL is
HQ AFSPC/A3J. AFSPC Operational testing and evaluation is defined as any test or test support
activity conducted by an Operational Test Organization (OTO), i.e., 346th Test Squadron (346
TS), 17th Test Squadron (17 TS), or14th Test Squadron (14 TS). OTO testing may also be used
to assess and report on a system’s maturity and potential to meet operational requirements.
Military Utility Assessments (MUA) and any other assessment activities other than those
described in this instruction and AFI 99-103 are not operational test activities and cannot be used
as sole support for fielding, operational acceptance, early operational use, trial period entry or
FRP decisions. Operational testing must represent how a system will perform in its intended
operational environment. During an extended acquisition process, changes to a system’s
operational environment (e.g., threats, Concept of Operations [CONOPS], operational needs)
may require operational testers to evaluate a system in a way that is not compatible with its
Acquisition Program Baseline (APB) or contractual specifications. This can be seen in systems
in which fiscal and/or schedule constraints prevent developers from keeping pace with the
changing operational environment. Nonetheless, AFSPC operational testers must evaluate
systems against the most current, valid operational requirements regardless of contractual
specifications or baselines. The operational testers will highlight where operational demands
deviate from APB or contractual specification to mitigate negative perceptions of a system
required to operate in a manner in which it was not designed or intended. Additionally, the
operational testers will base their fielding, operational acceptance, early operational use, or trial
period entry recommendation on the totality of information gained during test and not simply on
the answers to Critical Operational Issues (COIs).
1.5. DoDI 5000. 02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System. Space and Cyberspace
acquisitions will follow DoDI 5000.02. T&E activities must be tailored to the specific process
milestone requirements dictated by the applicable policy, but are very similar in all other
respects. This instruction will provide guidance on how AFSPC T&E organizations will support
the development and maintenance of specific test-related documentation, but will defer to
DoDI 5000.02 to specify when and for what specific purpose those documents are required.
1.6. Cross-command and Multi-service Cooperation. AFMC or Air Force Operational Test
and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) units may conduct Space and Cyberspace test activities, but
AFSPC must ensure T&E continuity throughout the life of a program through liaison offices and
early involvement activities. Multi-service or cross-domain programs may involve test agencies
from other services. The processes outlined in this instruction rely on mutual support between
 8                                                       AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010


commands/services and clear understanding of what each pledges to the T&E effort. The ITT is
a critical link in ensuring proper and effective communication among the involved organizations.
The ITT Charter will document the lead AF/service OT&E and DT&E test organizations,
specific roles and responsibilities of its members, governing T&E guidance and support
agreements according to AFI 99-103.
1.7. Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) T&E Oversight List. OSD/Director of
Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) and the Director, Developmental Test and Evaluation
(DDT&E) maintain a list of major programs that have congressional or other high-level interest.
OSD may become involved in the test process, test plan development, and test execution and
may require special briefings. Consequently, those programs will be identified on the Test
Priority List (TPL) and their special requirements identified early on. All reports and briefings
for those programs for which AFOTEC is determined to not be involved are the responsibility of
AFSPC OTOs and will be coordinated through HQ AFSPC. All test briefings going to
HQ United States Air Force (USAF) and OSD will be coordinated through HQ USAF Test and
Evaluation Policy and Programs Division (HQ USAF/TEP).
     1.7.1. For those oversight programs that AFSPC test agencies are responsible for testing,
     direct communication with OSD action officers by the ITT is authorized to determine
     OSD/DOT&E and DDT&E involvement, testing and reporting requirements.
     1.7.2. Where OSD action officers decline participation in test planning or the T&E
     stakeholders are unable to make a determination as to OSD involvement or requirements,
     AFSPC test agencies will elevate their concerns through the T&E CL to HQ USAF/TEP for
     adjudication and resolution.
1.8. Office of the Secretary of Defense for Developmental Test and Evaluation
(DDT&E). The mission of the DDT&E is to ensure that DT&E is effectively addressed
throughout the entire acquisition life cycle. DDT&E has responsibilities in the areas of policy
and guidance, program oversight, T&E workforce, and program development including the
review and approval of Test and Evaluation Strategies (TES) and Test and Evaluation Master
Plans (TEMP) for all Major Defense Acquisition Programs. In order to achieve technical results
earlier, DDT&E requires participation in the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) and Source
Selection processes. The DDT&E works in coordination with the DOT&E to coordinate the
integration of DT&E with OT&E.
1.9. Test Infrastructure and Resource Planning. AFSPC organizations managing or
supporting DT&E or OT&E activities shall identify prior to Critical Design Review (CDR), or as
early as possible, test requirement gaps based on expected capability development initiatives.
Resources required to fill these gaps shall be planned and secured by HQ AFSPC IAW AFI 99-
109, Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Test and Evaluation Resource Planning and
AFSPCI 10-1203, Space Range Review Board (SRRB).
1.10. Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment (ITW/AA) Testing. The North
American Aerospace Defense Command Instruction (NI) 10-3, Mission Integrity, Change
Control Management, and Test Control for the Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack
Assessment (ITW/AA) System, and USSTRATCOM Instruction (SI) 508-10, Mission Integrity,
Change Control Management, and Test Control for the ITW/AA System governs the control and
conduct of test and exercise activities involving organizations that are part of, or interface with
the ITW/AA system. For further guidance, testers using or interacting with ITW/AA systems
AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010                                                                      9


will reference NI 10-3 and SI 508-10. The Test Control Mission is assigned to the 721st Mission
Support Group which is the final authority for possible compromise of ITW/AA systems,
potential operations impacts and any other safety issues during the scheduling, conduct and
control of all tests.
1.11. T&E Funding Sources. The funding sources for T&E depend upon the nature and
purpose of the work and type of testing. Test agencies are referred to DoD 7000.14-R, Financial
Management Regulation, Vol 2A, Chapter 1; AFI 65-601 Vol 1, Budget Guidance and
Procedures, Chapter 14; and AFI 99-109, MRTFB Test & Evaluation Resource Planning, for
explicit guidance.
   1.11.1. Services or agencies requesting AFSPC operational test support or expenditure of
   test assets will be required to provide funding commensurate with test support requested
   IAW the Economy Act or other authorizing legislation. Funding source, specific fund site(s)
   and organizational financial point of contact information, must be included with test requests
   submitted to HQ AFSPC/A3JO.
   1.11.2. 24 AF shall provide funding to the 346 TS for support of test and assessment of
   Real-time Operations and Innovation capabilities.
1.12. Counterspace Testing. For all counterspace testing activities, the Lead Test Organization
(LTO) will ensure all test activities comply with AFSPCI 10-211, Counterspace Activity
Approval Package.
1.13. Cyberspace Real-time Operations and Innovation Testing. “Cyberspace Real-time
Operations and Innovations” is defined as the tools and tactics generated in response to 1) critical
Category 1 through 8 intrusion incidents (as outlined in the Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff
Manual 6510-01A. Information Assurance (IA And Computer Network Defense (CND) Volume I
(Incident Handling Program) as determined by 24 AF; 2) discovered critical vulnerabilities not
currently mitigated within the AF Enterprise network; and 3) critical joint cyberspace needs
which 24 AF has been tasked to fulfill. In instances in which it is necessary to meet real time
operational needs the associated testing will be equally responsive via delegation of risk
acceptance to 24 AF Commander. This instruction is meant to cover these real-time operations
and innovation test planning, processes and procedures in addition to rapid and foundational
testing. If a specific T&E requirement does not fall precisely into one of the types of testing or
processes described in this instruction, consult with the T&E CL to select and tailor the type of
testing that best fits the need.
1.14. Annual Blanket Test Request and Order. If an organization anticipates numerous
similar-type, short duration, and limited scope test supporting taskings, one Test Asset Support
Request form may be submitted to cover all such events. These blanket test requests and task
orders are not the norm, and will be considered on a case by case basis. In the blanket test
request, all test support and test execution activities that will be accomplished under the authority
of that test request will be stipulated. Once a HQ AFSPC/A3 tasking order number has been
issued to execute, the blanket task order will provide the test squadron with the ability to support
and/or execute evaluations of related systems, concepts, and tactics, techniques, and procedures.

  1.14.1. Testing in response to a Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON)/Urgent Operational
  Need (UON) is not authorized under a blanket test request and order, and will require
  separate request and tasking.
  1.14.2. Currently, expected Blanket Test Requests and Orders consist of Emissions Security
  (EMSEC), Unified Capabilities, Rapid Assessment Team and cyberspace real-time
  innovations and operations testing.
AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010                                                                  11


                                           Chapter 2

                               KEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS

2.1. Capabilities-Based Testing. The capabilities-based approach refers to a linking of T&E
objectives, measures and issues to operational enabling concepts. It does not mean T&E will
discourage the use of criteria in testing. Early tester involvement in the requirements
development process is intended to facilitate the development of operationally meaningful
criteria for use in T&E. While DT&E may continue to use a building block approach to
technology development that will lead to operationally useful effects, testers must ensure their
integrated strategy supports operationally relevant requirements.
2.2. Integrated Testing. Integrated testing is meant to convey an increased emphasis on
a planned, concerted effort by operational and developmental testers, including both government
and contractors, to structure all T&E as an efficient continuum spanning the entire program life
cycle. The goals are to reduce risks, identify deficiencies, support decision makers, reduce time
and cost and increase efficiency. It highlights the need to reduce the redundancies, missed
opportunities and unnecessary risks incurred when T&E is approached through separate and
independent DT&E, OT&E and contractor test strategies. It does not mean DT&E, dedicated
OT&E or contractor testing will disappear. For some programs and projects, the traditional
approach to testing may be the most effective, but programs and projects will make every
attempt to build a strategy for an integrated testing and independent evaluation that exploits
opportunities provided by sharing information and collaborating at all levels. For instance,
OT&E input into DT&E designs may result in reaching operational conclusions earlier in
development and shortening dedicated OT&E periods. Integrated test planning is accomplished
by an ITT (or equivalent) and documented in an Integrated Test Concept (ITC) and the TEMP. It
is incumbent upon the ITT to leverage all planned DT&E efforts for potential OT&E
applicability.
2.3. Tester Collaboration. One of the keys to maximizing the benefits of integrated testing is
the early and continued involvement of all testers in the requirements definition and acquisition
processes. Throughout this document, the term “testers” will refer to a collaborative effort of
developmental (contractor or government) and operational testers. If a specific test specialty is
called for, the instruction will note the exception. Early tester involvement in requirements
definition ensures operational requirements are testable in an operationally realistic environment
and allows for meaningful test measures and criteria development. Early tester collaboration
facilitates the development of a single integrated test strategy that incorporates DT&E and
OT&E requirements/objectives. Tester collaboration and the creation of an integrated strategy
serves to: increase the linkage between DT&E and OT&E measures; increase the likelihood that
test events and data collected during development can be used to provide early insight to system
effectiveness and suitability; and potentially shortens dedicated OT&E.
2.4. Test Priority List. The TPL is a comprehensive, prioritized list of all HQ AFSPC
approved operational and integrated test asset support activities (to include requests for
Sufficiency of Operational Test Reviews (SOTR) or Capabilities and Limitations (C&L)
Reports) conducted by AFSPC test assets. The TPL sets the relative priority of projects for
AFSPC operational test organizations and serves as a guide for allocating resources (e.g.,
scheduling and personnel). The TPL is managed by the T&E CL on behalf of the HQ
 12                                                       AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010


AFSPC/A3. It contains a prioritized listing of all AFSPC operational tests and integrated test
events in the planning, execution, or reporting phase, as well as all test asset support activities
and OTO early influence activities. These test events are identified during an annual test call and
then appropriately prioritized. Test events that are not identified during the annual test call will
be recognized as out-of-cycle and will be exposed to the same rigor with respect to prioritization
and adjudication as those identified during the annual test call prior to being placed on the TPL.
The approved and published TPL will contain all applicable information as identified by the
T&E community in order to clearly describe AFSPC resource allocation and utilization.
   2.4.1. Test Priority List Process. The TPL is the mechanism by which the HQ AFSPC T&E
   CL manages operational test asset support. Once the T&E CL has included a test asset
   support activity on the published TPL, the Space Innovation and Development Center
   (SIDC), or 688th Information Operations Wing (IOW) as appropriate will ensure that the
   proper test organization is tasked to support that activity. SIDC and 688 IOW will deconflict
   the use of test resources (test units, test infrastructure, etc.) and ensure HQ AFSPC test
   priorities are not impacted by internal organization test requirements. HQ AFSPC/A3 or
   designee will serve as the final adjudicator in those cases in which test resource deconfliction
   cannot be achieved at the unit level. The TPL process involves five distinct phases: Test
   Call, Test Resource Evaluation, Prioritization, Executability and Publication.
       2.4.1.1. Test Call. During October each year, the T&E CL will disseminate a test call
       memorandum to all HQ AFSPC/A2/A3/A4/A5/A6/A7/A8 divisions, AFSPC Numbered
       Air Forces (NAF) and wings, United States Air Force Warfare Center (USAFWC),
       AFOTEC and other Major Command (MAJCOM) test and product centers. This test call
       will request that space or cyberspace systems, programs, projects and any external
       organizations requiring AFSPC test asset support within the next fiscal year will respond
       to the test call with a Test Asset Support Request sent to the T&E CL. These Test Asset
       Support Requests will then be screened and forwarded to the appropriate wing or center.
       2.4.1.2. Test Asset Support Requests. Requests for AFSPC test support will be made as
       soon                                                                                       as
       a support requirement is identified or anticipated in coordination with the applicable
       Capability Command Lead (CCL)/ITT. Test Asset Support Requests are a formal request
       for operational test asset support. Test Asset Support Request forms must be completed to
       the best ability of the requestor given the maturity of the system and must be signed by an
       O-5 or equivalent before being forwarded to the T&E CL. To adequately portray the
       AFSPC operational test squadron tempo, SIDC and 688 IOW will provide one standing
       request a year at the annual test call to annotate the prioritized list for use of AFSPC
       operational test assets for internal real-time operations and innovation activities. Internal
       taskings must be placed on the TPL for HQ AFSPC/A3 visibility into resource
       availability. The Test Asset Support Request form can be found on the HQ AFSPC/A3JO
       portal
       (https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=
       OO-TE-SP-15-9&Filter=OO-TE-SP-15) or requested through the HQ AFSPC/A3JO
       workflow email (a3to.wf@peterson.af.mil).
           2.4.1.2.1. Requests must include the desired supported decision date (i.e. decisions
           that support fielding, operational acceptance, early operational use, trial period entry,
           or FRP decision).
AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010                                                                    13


     2.4.1.3. Resource Evaluation. The resource evaluation phase of the TPL process is
     defined as the response from the SIDC or 688 IOW to Test Asset Support Requests.
     Following appropriate initial system discovery and coordination with the requestor, test
     support responses will describe the system under test as well as provide the initial
     estimate of required resources (in terms of both funding and manpower). It must be
     understood these early resource estimates may change as all involved parties refine their
     knowledge of test requirements leading up to test execution. Test asset support responses
     are developed by the SIDC and 688 IOW and forwarded to the T&E CL within 45 days
     of receipt of test requests generated from the annual test call or an out-of-cycle test
     request.
     2.4.1.4. Prioritization. Upon receipt of all test execution and support requirements, HQ
     AFSPC/A3JO will compile the T&E candidate list, and begin to populate the TPL
     scoring matrices. HQ AFSPC/A3JO will coordinate the proposed Fiscal Year (FY) test
     listing with the appropriate HQ AFSPC divisions and organizations. After completing
     their review, the applicable HQ AFSPC organizations will use the proposed FY test
     listing in their preparation for the January program review and prioritization scoring by
     the 3-Letter Test Prioritization Board. Following the 3-Letter board, the draft TPL will be
     sent to 2-Letter coordination to finalize Command test priorities.
        2.4.1.4.1. Operational Test Coordination Meeting. HQ USAF/TEP will chair an
        AFOTEC-MAJCOM operational test coordination meeting prior to annual POM
        development and submission to establish clear resourcing responsibilities. In order to
        facilitate this discussion, the prioritized list of AFSPC test requirements for the
        proposed FY should be made available at this meeting.
     2.4.1.5. Executability. Following prioritization, the resulting list of tests are forwarded
     by the T&E CL to the appropriate wing or center so that a determination can be made
     based on manning and available resources of how many of the tests can be executed for
     the fiscal year in question. This step will highlight those tests that will be executed for the
     fiscal year and those that may have to be held over until the next year or mitigated in
     some other fashion.
     2.4.1.6. Publication. Once the prioritized list of tests has been reviewed for executability,
     HQ AFSPC/A3 will sign and publish the official list of executable tests for that year
     which includes task order numbers for all applicable tests. The TPL will be published on
     the HQ AFSPC/A3JO SIPR SharePoint site or may be requested via email to the HQ
     AFSPC/A3JO workflow (a3to.wf@peterson.af.mil). Once added to the TPL with an
     associated task order number, SIDC or 688 IOW as appropriate will task the proper test
     organization to support the new activity. Funding and/or a written commitment for
     funding as well as a list of testable requirements is required and must be provided to the
     test organization before task order numbers will be assigned on the TPL. Exceptions to
     this funding and requirements condition prior to receipt of a task order will be evaluated
     by the T&E CL on a case-by-case basis. Approved tests and test asset support activities
     will remain on the TPL until all test efforts are complete or at the direction of the T&E
     CL. Originating test asset support requestors may request removal of TPL activities via
     official memorandum signed by an O-5 or equivalent from the Program Office/Developer
     and test organization(s). The memorandum must be provided to the T&E CL at the
     earliest opportunity for approval of the request.
 14                                                        AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010


           2.4.1.6.1. Due to security constraints, a separate annex to the TPL will be maintained
           by the T&E CL of all AFSPC approved, special access program operational and
           integrated tests and test asset support activities.
       2.4.1.7. Out-of-Cycle Tests. Out of cycle tests will use the same TPL process as those
       that are developed through the annual test call. Out-of-Cycle test requestors must submit
       a Test Asset Support Request to the T&E CL, after which the request will be adjudicated
       and prioritized using the TPL process before being added to the TPL. Additions to the
       TPL must be approved by the HQ AFSPC/A3 unless delegated. UON/JUON activities
       that require test must still use the TPL process; however they will receive expedited
       adjudication and coordination. UONs and JUONs take precedence and are placed on the
       TPL immediately upon receipt of a Test Asset Support Request.
       2.4.1.8. Urgent requests. Urgent requests must be clearly identified by the requesting
       organization. T&E CL will authorize, in writing, expedited test asset support as
       appropriate and, when applicable, identify test asset support taskings as urgent on the
       TPL.
2.5. Emissions Security (EMSEC). EMSEC program requirements and test roles and
responsibilities are described in Air Force Systems Security Instruction (AFSSI) 7700 and 7702,
Emissions Security. The 346 TS is the EMSEC / Telecommunications and Electrical Machinery
Protected from Emanations Security (TEMPEST) testing organization for the Air Force and is
tasked by the Air Force Network Integration Center (AFNIC)/Air Force- Certified TEMPEST
Technical Authority (AF-CTTA). However, annual EMSEC activities requested by AFNIC/AF-
CTTA will be maintained on the HQ AFSPC TPL for operational tempo situational awareness.
AFNIC/AF-CTTA will provide one annual Test Asset Support Request to the T&E CL. Once
agreed to and placed on the TPL, AFNIC/AF-CTTA will notify AFSPC/A3J of revisions to the
TPL and inclusion of Test Asset Support Requests on the consolidated schedule. AFSPC/A3J
will forward these requests to the 346 TS for schedule planning and resource requirements.
2.6. Specialized Tests and Assessments. Specialized tests and assessments for Information
Assurance (IA) and Evaluated Level of Assurance (ELA) may support broader OT&E efforts or
be conducted as standalone activities, but in either case, they vie for limited testing resources. All
IA tests or ELA assessment support activities will be included in the TPL either as separate
events or in association with another test activity (e.g., Force Development Evaluation (FDE)).
Telecommunication System Security Assessment Program (TSSAP) assessments will also utilize
the test request process and be portrayed on the TPL. Activities outside the scope of an OT&E
effort will request stand-alone support through the Test Asset Support Request form.
2.7. 346th Test Squadron Range. For the purposes of AFSPCI 99-103, the 346 TS ranges are
considered test assets. Organizations wishing to request only 346 TS range time or range assets
will utilize the Test Asset Support Request form and forward it to the T&E CL with a courtesy
copy to the 346 TS. 346 TS range activities will be prioritized and kept separately from the HQ
AFSPC TPL. The range list and schedule will be maintained by 346 TS.
2.8. AFSPC Operational Assets. The definition of an AFSPC operational asset is an AFSPC-
assigned space or cyberspace system, individual part of a system, AFSPC personnel or AFSPC-
assigned supporting infrastructure whose primary mission is not T&E. Operational asset support
is the assistance provided by an AFSPC operational system or unit for a test activity. A space
system is a system with a major functional component that operates in the space environment or
AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010                                                                    15


which, by convention (e.g., ground-based sensors), is so designated. It usually includes a space
element, a link element, and a terrestrial element. However, a space system may also consist of
components that travel between space modes: space to ground, ground to space, or ground to
ground through space. For the purposes of this instruction, Cheyenne Mountain Complex (CMC)
command and control systems linked to more conventional space systems (e.g., Space Based
Infrared Sensor (SBIRS)) and acquired, sustained and upgraded by AFSPC are, by convention,
AFSPC operational assets. An AFSPC cyberspace system is one assigned to AFSPC and used for
the special purpose of defense of the cyber domain, operations of the cyber domain and delivered
for use to force providers.
2.9. Fielding Decision Authority. Fielding Decision Authority is defined as the authority to
release a system for operational use by units in the field or fleet. A fielding decision is separate
from an operational acceptance decision. AFSPCI 10-604 Space Operations Weapon System
Management and AFSPCI 10-1204, Satellite Operations, should be referenced for information
relating to operational acceptance decisions of AFSPC systems.
   2.9.1. ITW/AA Fielding. NI 10-3 and SI 508-10 define the Operations Approval Board
   (OAB) and Operations Approval Panels (OAPs) as the decision authorities for configuration
   changes, communications and interface changes, development approval, trial period
   entry/exit, and fielding of ITW/AA software, hardware, and firmware. HQ AFSPC/A3
   performs the AFSPC operational acceptance for ITW/AA systems per AFSPCI 10-604.
2.10. Sufficiency of Operational Test Reviews (SOTR). SOTRs are a formal type of OT&E
and will only be conducted by SIDC or 688 IOW operational testers. SOTRs are used in the
absence of any significant dedicated operational testing for systems of limited scope and
complexity. SOTRs reduce unnecessary or duplicative OT&E if sufficient DT&E or integrated
DT&E/OT&E data exists for a sound decision. They may be used in support of fielding decisions
but cannot be the only source of data supporting milestone or acquisition decisions. To
accomplish a SOTR, operational testers will conduct a review of all relevant contractor and
government test data to determine if sufficient testing has been accomplished to support a
fielding, operational acceptance, early operational use or trial period entry recommendation.
Appropriate risk assessments must also be complete and reviewed by the applicable safety office.
Approval for use of SOTRs as a test strategy must be obtained through coordination with the
T&E CL.
2.11. Capability and Limitation (C&L) Report. The purpose of C&L reports is to support
early fielding of prototypes or pre-production systems as well as technology transitions and
urgent testing (e.g., Urgent Operational Need, Joint Urgent Operational Need) when a complete
operational test is not feasible prior to a decision being required. No active testing is associated
with a C&L Report. The C&L is only a compilation and organization of all existing and
available data sources. The C&L report cannot make fielding, operational acceptance, early
operational use, trial period entry or FRP recommendations. Approval for use of C&L Reports
must be obtained through coordination with the T&E CL.
2.12. Operational Utility Evaluation (OUE). The OUE may be used in AFSPC to execute
flexible OT&E in support of fielding, operational acceptance, early operational use, trial period
entry, FRP or acquisition milestone decisions. While the FDE remains a principal type of
operational test to supporting fielding, operational acceptance, milestone decisions and other

mechanism when appropriate. The OUE may be used when other test types are not appropriate
due to scope and rigor requirements or time limitations and may be used for any system in which
a formal FDE is not applicable per AFI 99-103. In addition, OUEs can evaluate military-unique
portions and applications of COTS, NDI, and GFE for military use. To maintain flexibility, test
products and processes may be tailored to meet OUE objectives. An ITT or equivalent
management structure (consisting of at least representation from the Test community, CCL, and
Program Manager (PM)) will define test timelines and required products unless otherwise
defined or directed in this instruction. Risks must be documented on a Test Execution Risk
Matrix (TERM) assessment and is to be reviewed by HQ AFSPC/SE unless delegated.
2.13. Additional types of OT&E. Other types of operational testing, including FDEs, Early
Operational Assessments (EOA) and Operational Assessments (OAs) are fully described in
AFI 99-103.
2.14. Cyberspace Technology Assessments. These 346 TS assessments provide early
operational data and feedback from testing to developers, operators, and decision makers and
also support the assessment of new technologies. They are low risk assessments of current or
evolving technology. Squadron commander or above will approve the applicable risk
assessments. Safety office review and approval for these assessments are at the group level or
higher.
   2.14.1. The 346 TS’s TSSAP is AFSPC’s Interoperability and IA test component for
   supporting the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Approved Products List (APL).
   All AFSPC units operate under the DISA Distributed Test Concept.
2.15. Certification and Accreditation (C&A). Most space and cyberspace systems are either
classified as Information Technology (IT) systems, or contain IT components of systems, and
must be certified and accredited IAW AFI 33-210, Air Force Certification and Accreditation
(C&A) Program (AFCAP) prior to T&E activities. IT systems requiring C&A must be registered
in the Enterprise IT Data Repository (EITDR). Program Managers of IT systems registered in
EITDR are responsible for reporting Federal, DoD, and AF compliance areas such as C&A,
Clinger-Cohen Act, Privacy Act, IT budget, Records Management, etc.

                                       TEST PLANNING

4.1. Early Involvement. AFI 10-601, AFI 63-101, AFI 99-103, AFSPCI 10-103 and IT Lean
Guidebook direct early tester participation in the development of a capability and its
requirements. The requirement process begins with an operator (e.g., MAJCOM) identifying
a capability shortfall to the Joint Staff and Air Staff. Upon identification of the capability
shortfall, the Air Staff will contact HQ AFSPC/A5 and request tester representation on a HPT.
Early Tester Involvement should occur at the front end of acquisition planning to include
meeting with potential offerors to guide discussions on test strategy. Involvement continues post-
vendor selection through early involvement with contractor DT&E planning and execution at
segment, sub-system, and system levels to ensure the operational view is captured in contractor
test documents and tests. HQ AFSPC/A5 will coordinate with appropriate HQ AFSPC
directorates to identify the required representatives. Table 4.1 describes how test representatives
will normally support the various activities associated with each step contained in the major
milestone acquisition process. Refer to the appropriate acquisition instruction (e.g., DoDI
5000.02) for information on when this activity will occur and what decision it will support. Refer
to AFSPC Cyber acquisition guidance for further guidance on cyberspace timelines.

 Note: The program office, OTO (MAJCOM Testers), and RTO (MAJCOM funded) are the OPRs for respective
 activities as applicable.
4.2. T&E Supporting Acquisition Programs.
   4.2.1. AFSPC personnel tasked to participate in HPTs developing ICDs and CDDs, and
   those HPTs following Requirements Strategy Reviews (RSR) will consult with
   developmental and operational testers to ensure T&E concerns are addressed. As a minimum,
   AFSPC testers will coordinate on all AFSPC-sponsored ICDs and CDDs. Testers will
   provide T&E expertise to the development of ICDs to ensure smooth transition to
   development of follow-on measures of effectiveness, suitability and performance. The PM
   will establish or join an ITT as soon as feasible, but no later than directed in the program’s
   first ADM. AFSPC PMs will ensure testers coordinate on RFPs, Statements of Objectives
   (SOO) and Statements of Work (SOW) to ensure testing concerns are adequately addressed.
   AFI 99-103 gives AFOTEC the first right of refusal to test a new system acquisition. AFSPC
   operational testers will continue to participate in ITTs regardless of AFOTEC participation.
   If OT&E is warranted and AFOTEC decides not to test an acquisition, the T&E CL in
   conjunction with SIDC and 688 IOW will determine the OT&E organization that will lead
   the test program using the TPL process.
AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010                                                                 35


   4.2.2. Accelerated Programs. Regardless of the entry point in the acquisition process, all
   programs, with the exception of TENCAP, Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations
   (JCTD), UONs/JUONs and ACTDs, will be aligned with an existing ITT or stand up a new
   one where possible. If, after coordination with the applicable test and program stakeholders a
   formal ITT is not applicable to an accelerated developmental activity, an informal
   management body made up of CCL, program office, any additional stakeholder and OTO
   representatives can be used to manage and adjudicate test issues. Testable requirements and
   supplemental documentation must be provided to the OTO by the CCL or program office (as
   appropriate).
   4.2.3. AFSPC Support to Oversight Programs. AFSPC test organizations may be
   required to support testing of Oversight Programs if AFOTEC defers. In those cases AFSPC
   testers will follow applicable guidance provided in AFI 99-103.
4.3. T&E Supporting Modification Programs.
   4.3.1. Command-Level Modifications. The process for modifying existing systems (i.e.,
   1067 Programs) is defined in AFI 63-101, AFI 63-131 and AFSPCI 63-104. For those
   modifications defined as command-level, ITT co-chairs or designated representatives will
   participate as a voting member in RVBs and Configuration Review Boards. See Figure 4.1
   The wings will develop procedures for the Configuration Review Boards and required
   membership. Specifically, they will develop processes for supporting level of test
   determinations from ITTs and ensuring full visibility into configuration review procedures by
   the applicable ITT. If an ITT does not exist and board members determine that program risk
   dictates possible OT&E, the PM or supporting agency will convene an ITT or join an
   existing ITT to identify and validate level of test determinations and develop an integrated
   test strategy as applicable. The ITT and AFSPC capability team will also be responsible for
   ensuring any OT effort is identified on the AFSPC TPL. If OT&E is determined through the
   ITT process to not be required, the PM or supporting organization will document necessary
   testing according to wing procedures. For all modifications, the Configuration Review Board
   will specify and document the type of testing required.
 36                                                   AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010


Figure 4.1. Test Support to Command-Level Modifications.




   4.3.2. Wing-Level Modifications. Installation and Checkout (I&C) are modifications
   defined by the MCP as operational wing-level form, fit and function replacements. The
   Wing/CC will provide guidance for documenting and conducting I&C as required. I&C are
   not forms of operational test activities performed by AFSPC operational test assets. The
   process for identifying requirements and modifying existing systems is defined in AFI 63-
   101, AFI 63-131, AFSPCI 63-104 and DOTE’s Guidelines for Conducting Operational Test
   and Evaluation for Software-Intensive System Increments. If the MCP refers the modification
   for AFSPC attention, the Configuration Review Board will assess the type and level of test
   required with ITT input. For all modifications the Configuration Review Board will specify
   and document the type of testing required.
AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010                                                                 37


4.4. Technology Transitions/Innovations. Test Asset Support Requests for technology
transition/innovation initiatives such as TENCAP projects, ACTDs, Advanced Technology
Demonstrations (ATD), and any other activities undertaken by an OTO must be prioritized and
placed on the TPL. Requirements, test documentation, and test activities will be coordinated
between the testing organization and the technology transition lead (e.g., TENCAP). AFSPC-
sponsored leads for technology transition efforts are highly encouraged to attend Test Manager
training conducted by the SIDC.
   4.4.1. T&E CL will be informed of Test Asset Support Requests to technology
   transition/innovation initiatives undertaken in support of SIDC/CC or 688 IOW or 595 SG or
   318 IOG, etc. T&E CL will add such activities to the TPL to ensure a complete picture of test
   asset utilization and availability is maintained.
4.5. Security. Standard security practices and procedures will be followed throughout the test
process. The LTO and unit are jointly responsible to ensure that appropriate security measures
are followed. The test plan will be classified IAW the applicable system SCGs or System
Protection Guides. In the event a SCG is not available, the Program office of the SUT will
provide security classification guidance. Tests conducted with foreign nationals or in which test
data will be released to foreign nationals must have their test materials reviewed by
HQ AFSPC/A8 for staffing to other appropriate authorities.
4.6. Modeling and Simulation.
   4.6.1. Verification and Validation. All M&S capabilities intended for use in support of
   system development and testing must be supported by appropriate documentation and
   adequate V&V activities IAW guidance provided in AFI 16-1001, Verification, Validation
   and Accreditation (VV&A) and AFI 161002, Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Support to
   Acquisition. Organizations developing M&S capabilities must work with product end-users,
   developmental and operational testers and other relevant organizations to develop and
   implement an M&S strategy (documented in a M&S Support Plan (MSSP)) that supports the
   entire acquisition lifecycle. The MSSP provides test organizations with information on the
   integrated use of M&S within program planning activities and across functional disciplines
   and provides an opportunity to review M&S requirements and development strategies.
   Participation in the development of the MSSP ensures that the test organization has early
   influence into M&S requirements and provides M&S resource requirements and information
   about VV&A resources. The M&S developer is responsible for documenting and executing
   an appropriate V&V approach IAW guidance provided in AFI 16-1001 and AFI 16-1002.
   Organizations will develop local procedures to define staffing requirements for V&V plans
   and reports. This guidance on M&S does not apply to range management.
   4.6.2. Accreditation. Upon successful completion of V&V activities, model proponents
   shall request formal accreditation of M&S capabilities for their intended use. M&S
   accreditation will be conducted IAW AFI 16-1001. The accreditation report will address the
   intended use of the capability, the impact of non-accreditation and any known limitations or
   risks based on supporting V&V results and the scope of intended use. All accreditation
   requests must be coordinated through the affected functional stakeholders, to include HQ
   AFSPC/A9 prior to submission for approval by the appropriate Accreditation Authority(ies).
   If accreditation is requested for multiple uses, a consolidated accreditation request may be
   submitted for approval. The Accreditation Authority for developmental testing support is the
 38                                                     AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010


   appropriate Commander of the product center program wing and the Accreditation Authority
   for operational testing support is SIDC/CC or 688 IOW/CC or as delegated.
4.7. Integrated Test Team.
   4.7.1. In accordance with AFI 99-103 each AFSPC program or mission area will have an
   ITT to coordinate and oversee the development and execution of integrated testing to support
   the acquisition and sustainment of subordinate systems. Programs and projects that do not
   fall under a program office will be placed under an applicable ITT in coordination with the
   appropriate CCL unless they are following an accelerated acquisition timeline. Reference
   Para 4.2.2 for additional information on accelerated programs. ITTs may have oversight of
   more than one related program to facilitate better coordination of limited resources and
   expertise.
   4.7.2. ITT Membership. The ITT leadership will tailor the membership, structure, and
   protocols as necessary to help ensure program success. ITT membership will include the
   system contractor, DT&E representative, SMC or ESC test representative as applicable, and
   OT&E representative. Contractor participants are not voting members of the ITT.
      4.7.2.1. Developmental Contractor. Developmental contractor support to the ITT is
      required to ensure a collaborative test planning approach with integrated objectives and
      adequate government oversight up to and including IOC declaration. The ITT does not
      nor will ever provide contractual direction; however, ITT actions may be manifested as
      contract modifications when submitted through the contracting officer.
      4.7.2.2. DT&E Representative. The materiel wing, group, staff agency, or designated
      RTO (as applicable) will supply a developmental testing representative for the ITT. This
      person will be the product center’s point of contact between the ITT, the wing, and
      development contractors dealing with test issues.
      4.7.2.3. OT Representative. OT representation throughout the life of the ITT is critical
      to successful test management and program success. The OT representative serves as the
      MAJCOM or AFOTEC test organization interface who uniquely represents the respective
      user community’s interests in assuring required, successful capabilities are fielded and
      sustained; operational tactics, techniques and procedures are developed and evaluated;
      and weapon systems are evaluated in a full end-to-end, operational context.
   4.7.3. ITT Charter. Each ITT will have a charter, whose signatories will scope the ITT’s
   responsibility to ensure it can provide necessary resources, adequate oversight and effectively
   integrate testing. The PM (or equivalent) of a program assigned to an existing ITT will
   coordinate any necessary changes to the ITT Charter and ensure his/her program is
   effectively integrated into the ITT structure and process. To assist in developing and
   executing program TESs, ITTs may charter or task subordinate working groups such as
   Combined Test Force (CTF), TIPT, Joint Reliability & Maintainability Evaluation Team, etc.
   to develop T&E documents or execute testing. The ITT will be co-chaired by program
   management (or equivalent) and operational test representatives. If the scope of an ITT
   encompasses both AFOTEC and AFSPC testing, AFOTEC and the AFSPC tester in
   accordance with AFI 99-103 will determine the preponderance of test workload and
   coordinate to determine chair responsibilities.
AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010                                                                   39


       4.7.3.1. Coordination requirements for AFSPC-ITT Charters. The minimum
       coordination requirements are: Submitted by PM (or equivalent ITT co-chair) and OTO
       unit commander; concurrence (at the O-6 or equivalent level) by the T&E CL, CCL,
       Operations Group representative and SMC or Electronics Systems Center (ESC) test
       representative (as applicable); approved and signed by PM O-6 and 595 SG/CC (space)
       or 318 IOG/CC (cyberspace).
   4.7.4. Conflict Resolution Process. Whenever a non-resolvable disagreement occurs within
   the ITT, the action officer co-chairs will use the conflict resolution process identified in the
   ITT Charter.
4.8. Test and Evaluation Master Plan and Life Cycle Management Plans. All programs
(other than those programs or projects referenced in Para 4.4) require either an approved TEMP
or LCMP, regardless of ACAT level, if they are to become a system of record or part of a system
of record. For programs or projects that fall under the definition of UON, JUON, or a transition
of technology that have a limited lifespan and limited or no sustainment do not require a TEMP
or LCMP. For programs on the OSD T&E Oversight List and within SMC’s space portfolio,
a stand-alone TEMP is required. For non-OSD T&E Oversight programs or other ESC programs
not within the PEO Space portfolio, the PM can produce a stand-alone TEMP (separate or as an
annex) and reference the program LCMP for details, or include critical elements of the TEMP in
the LCMP. The LCMP must fully complement the content of a TEMP, particularly manpower
and resource allocations. LCMPs will clearly state that they are being used in the place of a
TEMP. LCMPs used in lieu of a TEMP must undergo rigorous review by the STIO (for space
systems), or the 318 IOG (for cyberspace systems), and the supporting OTO to ensure LCMP
fidelity and organization matches TEMP T&E content requirements. LCMPs used in lieu of a
TEMP must also follow the TEMP approval process. The TEMP or LCMP presents more mature
and detailed information than is available in the TES. It will direct the system testing approach
over the life of a system, including sustainment. A TEMP should also provide sufficient
guidance to develop Integrated Test Concepts (ITC) as applicable. Non-ESC sustainment
programs approaching a Milestone or ADM deadlines that only have an LCMP will produce a
TEMP unless waived from this requirement by HQ AFSPC/A3. Reference Air Force Pamphlet
63-128, Guide to Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management, AFI 99-103 and DoD
5000-series for more specific instructions on LCMP or TEMP development and approval
guidance for ACAT I, ACAT II, or OSD Oversight list programs. TEMPs for remaining
programs will normally be co-signed by the CCL and T&E CL.
   4.8.1. All TEMPs and LCMPs must contain an OT&E strategy for IA evaluation in an
   operational environment, to include systems and networks to be operated by representative
   end users/network administrators. The TEMP or LCMP shall identify all IA T&E resources
   required to execute the IA portion of OT&E, to include funding sources and responsible
   organizations. TEMPs and LCMPs must also address the necessity for scheduling and
   conducting IA evaluations prior to a dedicated OT&E phase of test.
   4.8.2. The minimum coordination requirements for Non-ACAT I/II and non-OSD Oversight
   TEMPs are: Submitted by PM and OTO unit commanders; Concurrence by the 595 SG/CC
   (space) or 381 OG/CC (cyberspace), SMC or ESC test representative and Operations Group
   Commander, approved and signed by the CCL and T&E CL. For LCMPs that are being
   developed in lieu of a TEMP, T&E CL will review for test requirements prior to approval.
 40                                                       AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010


   4.8.3. All AFSPC Non-ACAT I/II and non-OSD Oversight TEMPs will use the current
   format as described in the Defense Acquisition Guide (available from the Defense
   Acquisition University website (https://dag.dau.mil/Pages/Default.aspx)). If a legacy
   program has an existing TEMP, that TEMP will be updated to the four part format and
   approved prior to the next mandatory review cycle or milestone decision.
4.9. Integrated Test Concept. The ITC links developmental and operational test objectives to
specific test events necessary to determine system performance and effectiveness/suitability. It
also serves as the guiding document for development of subordinate detailed test plans covering
integrated testing, contractor testing, DT&E and OT&E. An ITC may cover a specified period of
time, particular phase of a program (e.g., Design Phase, Build Phase, Sustainment Phase), but
may also be tailored to fit ITT needs. ITC format is flexible and can be adapted to meet the needs
of individual programs.
4.10. Detailed Test Plans. The LTO will prepare detailed test plans. Approved detailed test
plans are required for testing AFSPC systems. Unless otherwise directed by HQ AFSPC, detailed
test plan approval authority will be based on overall technical or safety risk (whichever is higher)
of the test as validated by the CRB or TRB/SRB Chair(s). See Table 5.1 for minimum approval
levels based on assessed risk. OT&E safety risks shall be validated as assessed from TERM
assessment at the SRB or CRB; software system safety and security shall be a part of such
assessments. Unless delegated, all detailed OT&E plans and those integrated test plans which
have been identified as high risk activities by a SRB, TRB or CRB will be coordinated at the
action officer level with the following offices: HQ AFSPC/SE, HQ AFSPC/A6N, T&E CL,
CCL, PM, NAF/A3, affected Operations Group, and the USAFWC if the test incorporates
USAFWC assets/support. If the planned test is low-medium risk, coordination requirements
identified above may instead be accomplished by the corresponding agencies at the Wing or
Center level.
   4.10.1. OT&E Detailed Test Plans will include: description of operational system and SUT;
   Critical Operational Issues, Operational Capabilities, Measures of Effectiveness and
   Measures of Suitability; test limitations; safety and technical risk assessments, any
   anticipated collateral and second-order effects identified during test execution as well as
   requirements for a Final Results Brief (FRB) and/or Final Report (Reference Para 6.3).
       4.10.1.1. OTO detailed test plans will reflect the requirement to conduct an appropriate
       level of IA testing, according to DoDI 8500.2 and CJCSI 6212.01. The OTO will use
       technical and non-technical methodologies to evaluate IA, to include conducting IA
       vulnerability evaluations and penetration/exploitation tests. For systems on the OSD
       T&E Oversight List for OT&E, the OTO will use DOT&E’s Procedures for Operational
       Test and Evaluation of Information Assurance in Acquisition Programs memorandum
       dated 21 January 2009.
   4.10.2. Single Integrated DT&E/OT&E Test Plans. If a single integrated Test Plan is
   chosen to be used, the AFSPC OT&E test plan approval authority level is maintained.
   4.10.3. Cyberspace Specialized Test/Assessment Plans -- EMSEC testing, ELAs,
   Information Assurance Testing, and Telephonic Assessments. These individual activities will
   utilize the test request process to include placement on TPL; however, 688 IOW will dictate
   the format, content and level of coordination and approval authority of reports and report
   briefs.
AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010                                                                      41


4.11. T&E Risk Management.
   4.11.1. Test Planning. Prior to test execution, each detailed test plan will be subjected to
   technical and safety reviews IAW AFI 99-103 and AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap
   Prevention Program. The OT&E TRB conducts an independent review of the test program to
   ensure the technical adequacy and validity of the plan to meet stated test objectives. The
   OT&E SRB conducts an independent review of the test program with respect to the unique
   risks generated by the test. The TRB and SRB can be conducted during a single CRB if
   appropriate. The decision to combine the review boards will be made jointly by the review
   board chairs. CRB will be chaired by the TRB chair. DT&E risk management will be
   accomplished using the established procedures of the product center or program office
   responsible for test execution.
      4.11.1.1. The appropriate review board (e.g., TRRB) will be provided the identified
      initial risk and the resulting revised risk based on mitigation plan actions. Additionally, at
      the TRRB the risks identified from an evaluation of the AFMAN 63-119 templates will
      be provided. The highest safety or technical risk rating after an approved mitigation plan
      will determine the TRRB chair level IAW Para 5.4.
   4.11.2. Technical Review Board. The TRB chair must be an appropriate technical
   representative (e.g., Technical Director or Chief Engineer) from the next higher echelon in
   the chain of command (with the appropriate security clearances) for the organization
   executing the test program. The TRB chair determines the timing of the TRB, but TRBs must
   occur prior to release of the detailed test plan for formal coordination beyond the squadron
   commander or equivalent level. At the conclusion of the TRB, the TRB chair will generate
   formal, written minutes, including a statement of the final technical risk level assessed for the
   test. These minutes must be published prior to final coordination of the detailed test plan.
   Each test team must brief and or provide the following to the TRB chair:
      4.11.2.1. Test requirements, objectives and test start, stop, pause guidelines.
      4.11.2.2. Test techniques and strategies, to include associated rationale, limitations, risks
      and issues.
      4.11.2.3. Identify applicable SCGs and issues involving COMSEC, OPSEC, INFOSEC
      and Physical Security.
   4.11.3. Safety Review Board. The appropriate safety office (i.e., Center, Wing) with the
   appropriate security clearances will chair the SRB. The SRB chair determines the timing of
   the SRB. Although external factors may preclude completing the SRB prior to release of the
   detailed test plan for coordination, as a minimum, the SRB chair must provide a preliminary
   overall test safety risk rating for inclusion in the detailed test plan. If an operational asset is
   being used in the test, the Wing with responsibility over the asset will take precedence over
   the Center safety office. At the conclusion of the SRB, the SRB chair will generate formal,
   written minutes, including a statement of the final safety risk level assessed for the test. Each
   test team must brief the items identified in Para 6.3.1 at its SRB briefing.
   4.11.4. Safety Planning Requirements.
      4.11.4.1. Early safety involvement is critical to the overall success of the planning
      process, so test teams will include safety representatives in the planning from the
42                                                      AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010


     beginning. Additionally, test teams will consult with HQ AFSPC/JA on liability issues
     that arise during safety planning. During the development of any test plan, the test team
     shall clearly identify the following essential elements within the body of the plan. These
     elements do not necessarily have to be contained in the plan’s safety section itself, but
     may be contained in an attached TERM assessment since they provide context for the
     safety considerations within the plan.

                                     TEST EXECUTION

5.1. Test Support Tasking.
   5.1.1. Test support activities can be broken into two broad categories: test asset support and
   operational asset support. Test asset support is the effort provided by an AFSPC test
   organization or dedicated test asset (e.g., test bed). AFSPC test organizations and dedicated
   test assets are High Demand, Low Density assets requiring HQ AFSPC oversight. As such,
   organizations seeking test asset support will follow the Test Asset Support Request process
   described in Para 2.4 and will explain the details of the support in the applicable test
   documentation (e.g., ITT Charter, TEMP, DTP). The definition of an AFSPC operational
   asset is a space or cyberspace system, individual part of a system, operational personnel or
   supporting infrastructure whose primary mission is not T&E. Operational asset support is the
   assistance provided by an AFSPC operational system or unit for a test activity. Organizations
   seeking operational asset support will follow the process described in Para 5.3 The HQ
   AFSPC/A3 or designee will serve as the final adjudicator in those cases in which test
   resource deconfliction cannot be achieved at the unit level.
5.2. Test Asset Support.
   5.2.1. Early Influence (Pre-ITT standup). AFSPC will provide T&E oversight and support
   for programs prior to ITT standup through the appropriate SMC test organization, ESC CTA,
   STIO and Responsible Test Organizations (RTO), as applicable. Support will also be
   provided through participation of operational test assets per the TPL. Requests for test
   squadron early influence involvement will be submitted to T&E CL using the TPL process.
   HQ T&E CL will evaluate the need for test asset support and forward the request to the
   appropriate organization (e.g., T&E CL Staff, STIO, 688 IOW). The organization tasked with
   supporting early influence will notify T&E CL via official memorandum once the program
   progresses past its early influence stages, thus requiring transition of involvement
   responsibilities to an operational test unit. The T&E CL will evaluate the rationale provided
   for transition. If transition is warranted, the T&E CL will notify the program manager and
   ensure they are aware of the TPL process described in Para 2.4 so that at the earliest
   opportunity an OTO may be designated for post-early influence and ITT support. This
   involvement is defined as day-to-day support of ITT activities and is separate from specific
   test events.
       5.2.1.1. Test asset support for systems with standing budgets. ITTs or equivalent
       with standing budgets (as opposed to ITTs using a fee for service model) and habitual
       relationships with a tasked OTO will develop a Test Asset Support Request form as
       required in Para 2.4, IAW with their budget availability and the ITT’s OT&E
       prioritization. The ITT will forward listings through the applicable CCL to the T&E CL
       for inclusion on the TPL.
5.3. Operational Asset Support. C-NAF/CC or their designee is the approval authority for
Operational Asset Use Requests (OAUR) involving AFSPC operational assets unless those
assets are under the OPCON of a Combatant Command. In that case, C-NAF/CC or designee
will verify that the requested asset is operationally ready to support testing, evaluate mission
 44                                                       AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010


impact and assess risk, after mitigation efforts. Based on this information the C-NAF/CC or
designee will approve or disapprove the use of the requested asset for test. The Combatant
Command CDR or designee is the release authority for operational use in support of test
activities for those requested assets in testing activities to deconflict mission priorities and test
requirements. The C-NAF/CC or designated representative will adjudicate conflicting requests
for use of operational assets.
   5.3.1. Requesting AFSPC operational assets. All OAURs will be forwarded to the
   applicable NAF HQ with a draft test plan for processing. After receipt of the OAUR, NAF
   and Wing representatives will coordinate the use of their respective assets. During
   coordination, Wing representatives ensure the amount and duration of testing does not
   adversely impact overall mission accomplishment while maximizing support to AFSPC test
   initiatives.
   5.3.2. Use of AFSPC operational assets in test activities. The RTO/OTO is responsible
   for coordinating with the appropriate TSM and ensuring that the appropriate CCL or program
   office generates each request for use of AFSPC operational assets. The process for requesting
   the use of operational assets in testing also applies to their use in demonstrations,
   experiments and studies. The request must include a detailed list of impacted systems,
   operational resources required (to include personnel), test schedule with fallback plan and
   downtime required, test points of contact and a Test Execution Risk Matrix (TERM)
   assessment. For AFSPC test units, Para 4.10 provides test plan approval guidance. For other
   agencies, test and demonstration plan approval will be IAW the appropriate guidance (e.g.,
   AFOTEC Instructions). The NAF will establish a process for requesting and approving the
   use of operational assets. At the NAF/CC’s or designee’s discretion, TRRB approval will be
   in accordance with RTO/OTO procedures and specific directions from NAF/CC or designee.
   The final authority to begin testing lies with the asset unit commander. Unit commanders will
   ensure that testing does not adversely impact overall mission success or safety. Operational
   asset support for test events will be documented on maintenance schedules or other
   documents as required. This process does not preclude the need to request MRTFB assets
   through the Universal Documentation System process or request space or cyberspace range
   assets through their respective processes. Para 1.10 provides additional guidance for the
   ITW/AA system.
   5.3.3. AFOTEC Test Resource Plans. AFOTEC TRPs serve as a planning tool for the
   command, but will not take the place of a formal response to the AFSPC external test request
   process. AFOTEC TRP identifies the resources and timelines required to support an
   AFOTEC conducted IOT&E, FOT&E, MOT&E, OUE, or OA. All projects that support
   AFOTEC managed tests require a TRP. The T&E CL is the focal point for the AFOTEC
   TRP coordination process. The T&E CL will task the appropriate organization to coordinate
   and concur on the resource requirements cited in the AFOTEC TRP. For non-concurrence, a
   formal non-concur memorandum directed back to AFOTEC by the T&E CL is required.
AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010                                                                 45

*RTO risk acceptance level will be in accordance with units MAJCOM instruction if unit is not
assigned to AFSPC.
5.4. Test Readiness Review Boards. Test Readiness Review Boards (TRRB) are required for
all DT&E, OT&E or integrated DT&E/OT&E testing. HQ AFSPC/A3 will chair OT&E TRRBs
for high risk operational tests (e.g., FDE, OUE, SOTR), unless HQ AFSPC/A3 has delegated
decision authority. All low to medium risk TRRBs and all OA TRRBs will be chaired by the
OTO Group level. The TRRB will be co-chaired by an equivalent individual from the
developmental program for integrated DT&E/OT&E activities. TRRBs for OT&E will be held
no later than five days prior to test execution and after receipt of a certification letter per
AFMAN 63-119 (as applicable). For high risk integrated testing the TRRB must be co-chaired
by HQ AFSPC/A3 unless delegated. As a minimum, the OTO, PTOs, system developer,
operating unit, AFSPC CCL, PM, safety representative and supporting units will be present for
all TRRBs. HQ AFSPC/SE representative is a mandatory member of all TRRBs chaired by the
HQ AFSPC/A3. Note: All cyberspace Real-time Operations and Innovation risk management
processes and TRRBs have been delegated to the 24 AF/CC.
   5.4.1. TRRBs will address: description of operational system and SUT; Critical Operational
   Issues*, Operational Capabilities*, system maturity; deficiency summaries; test limitations;
   safety and technical risk assessments; and any anticipated collateral and second-order effects
   identified of test execution. Note: Items identified with an asterisk (*) are requirements for
   OT&E only.
   5.4.2. Cyberspace Specialized Test/Assessment Readiness Review Boards. EMSEC
   testing, ELAs, Information Assurance Testing and Telephonic Assessments. These individual
   activities will utilize the Test Asset Support Request process to include placement on TPL;
   however, 688 IOW will dictate the level of approval and chair of TRRBs.
5.5. Certification to Enter Dedicated Operational Test and Evaluation.
   5.5.1. Certification of readiness to enter test letter. To certify systems are ready to enter
   dedicated OT&E, the PM will coordinate a letter from the certifying official to the SIDC/CC
   or 688 IOW/CC (as applicable) with courtesy copies to HQ AFSPC/A3, the appropriate HQ
   AFSPC CCL, HQ AFSPC/A3 functional manager, HQ AFSPC/A5 requirements lead,
   applicable C-NAF and applicable Operational Wing/CC NLT 30 days prior to TRRB. The
   SIDC or 688 IOW will concur or non-concur with the certifying official’s assessment, and
   restate any reservations or positions on unresolved issues. However, operational test
   squadron commanders are obligated to proceed to TRRB. System certification letters are not
   required for integrated DT&E/OT&E where there will be no separate OT&E phase or for
   OAs.
 46                                                       AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010


   5.5.2. AFMAN 63-119 templates. AFMAN 63-119 templates will be utilized for any
   AFSPC test or assessment Test Readiness Review. Templates may be tailored for specific
   use. All IATT/IATO requirements must be met prior to execution of test activities.
5.6. Pre-test Activities using Operational Assets. Pre-test activities are those efforts intended
as precursors to formal developmental or operational testing. Pre-test activities which will
change the OPSCAP of an operational site will have an approved detailed test plan. If testers
wish to include pre-test activities in an overarching detailed test plan, the plan must include
contingency procedures for reacting to unexpected outcomes from pre-test activity execution. All
pre-test activities which will change the OPSCAP of an operational site will be preceded by a
TRRB approved at the appropriate level based on risk assessment. A chair may elect to combine
TRRBs for related test events occurring close to each other such as pre-test activities
immediately followed by formal testing. Pre-test activities that will not change the OPSCAP of
an operational site must have prior approval from the operational site’s squadron commander.
5.7. Test Start/Pause/Stop Procedures.
   5.7.1. The purpose of these procedures is to inform the operational community of certain test
   activities and provide the test schedule, contact points, and guidance for interacting with the
   unit/SUT.
   5.7.2. Test Start. The OTO or LTO as applicable will transmit a Test Start message no later
   than 24 hours prior to the start of execution of tests for all OUEs and FDEs as well as any
   tests using operational assets. The message will be distributed to all units at or above wing
   level that may be impacted by test activities, to include inadvertent release of data outside the
   SUT. The distribution list for the Test Start message will be used for all subsequent test
   messages.
   5.7.3. Test Pause. There may be occasions that require some form of intervention short of a
   formal “stop test.” In these instances, the LTO or OTO as applicable may pause test. The
   decision to pause test must be coordinated with the TM, PM and test plan approval authority.
   In the event of a test pause, the OTO or LTO will notify the T&E CL within 24 hours.
       5.7.3.1. Safety/Security Test Pause. The LTO or OTO as applicable will ensure that all
       procedures and criteria for pausing a test event for safety or security concerns are briefed
       at the TRRB and included in Test Team training and all site in-briefs. For all safety and
       security test pauses, the TM will submit an incident report per Para 6.1 A follow-up
       incident report will be issued in the event of a test restart and will explain the corrective
       actions taken.
   5.7.4. Test Restart Message. Following the decision to pause testing, the test plan approval
   authority will establish restart criteria after consulting with the PM. A formal TRRB is not
   required prior to restarting test after pausing, unless the test plan approval authority requests
   one.
   5.7.5. Test Stop Message. The primary purpose of a Test Stop message is to inform the
   operational community that on-site test activities have ceased. The Test Stop message is
   released under one of two conditions, either the test is complete or the test is not complete
   based on preliminary status of test objectives. Refer to the following sections for details on
   the circumstances and requirements for each condition.
AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010                                                                 47


     5.7.5.1. Test Stop, Test Complete Message. When testing activities have ceased and
     test objectives have been met, the OTO or LTO as applicable will transmit a Test Stop,
     Test Complete message no later than 24 hours after all on-site test activities have ceased.
     This message serves to inform the operational community that the units and personnel
     involved in supporting the test may resume normal operations. It also provides situational
     awareness for leadership on the status of test activities and at a minimum will be
     transmitted at the conclusion of all OUEs, FDEs and any other tests using operational
     assets. The message will summarize test execution success or failure, initial deficiency
     listing (if available) and date of the last dedicated test event (LDTE). LDTE should
     normally occur no later than 75 days prior to the supported decision date. This message
     will also indicate the dates of the initial post-test DRB and reporting timelines. This
     message will not include test results, analysis, conclusions or recommendations and will
     not be used to support fielding, operational acceptance, early operational use, trial period
     entry, or FRP decisions.
     5.7.5.2. Test Stop, Test Not Complete Message. When testing activities are halted
     because of significant system performance or safety issues and the test cannot be
     restarted within a reasonable amount of time following a test pause, the LTO or OTO as
     applicable will transmit a Test Stop, Test Not Complete message. This message serves to
     inform the operational community the on-site test has ceased prematurely and the units
     and personnel involved in supporting the test may resume normal operations. It also
     provides situational awareness for leadership on the status of test activities and at a
     minimum will be transmitted for all OUEs, FDEs and any other tests using operational
     assets. For dedicated operational tests, the Test Stop, Test Not Complete message will be
     accompanied by, or followed up with, a letter decertifying the system for dedicated
     operational test. Operational test organizations are responsible for documenting a process
     for decertifying systems for dedicated operational test.

                                     TEST REPORTING

6.1. Incident Reports. The LTO’s TM/TD will transmit an incident report whenever a test is
halted due to safety, security or other event where immediate notification of higher authority is
warranted. If operational reporting per AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, is required, the
TM/TD need not send a separate incident report, but must ensure all applicable organizations are
addressed. As a minimum, for safety and security related issues, HQ AFSPC/A3/A5/SE,
SIDC/CC/CV, 688 IOW/CC/CV, SMC/CC/CV, 595 SG/CC, 318 IOG/CC/CV, Program
Office/CC, applicable Wing/CC/SE and, as required, CC2SG/CD will be addressed.
6.2. Developmental Test Reports. Specific reporting details such as timelines and address lists
will be specified in the detailed test plan. As a minimum, results of DT&E will be published to
an ITT-approved data repository available to all stakeholders. The PM is responsible for
establishing the data repository and ensuring proper protection is afforded to all sensitive
information.
6.3. Operational Test Reports.
   6.3.1. OT&E Test Reports. OT&E Test Reports come in the form of both written Final
   Reports and FRBs. In either event, the OTO will address: description of operational system
   and SUT; results regarding Critical Operational Issues*, Operational Capabilities*; system
   maturity*; deficiency summaries*; test limitations*; and any observed collateral* and
   second-order effects* of test execution. Additionally, OT&E Test Reports must include
   adequate details of test scenarios, processes and deviations from planned test procedures to
   support decision-maker requirements. Finally, OT&E Test Reports must include supported
   decision recommendations* when the test event directly supports such decisions. An
   executive summary including all asterisked (*) items will be included in Final Reports. Final
   reports will also include Measures of Effectiveness and Measures of Suitability.
       6.3.1.1. OT&E Report Approval Authority. The approval authority for the test plan
       also approves the OT&E Test Report, unless otherwise specified.
       6.3.1.2. OT&E Report Release Authority. Unless decision authority has been
       delegated, HQ AFSPC/A3 will release OT&E Test Reports resulting from AFSPC OT&E
       if the report will be distributed to organizations outside of AFSPC and supports fielding,
       operational acceptance, early operational use, trial period entry, or FRP decisions. If test
       activity did not support fielding, operational acceptance, early operational use, trial
       period entry, or FRP decisions, the report approval authority is also the release authority.
       6.3.1.3. OT&E FRBs. FRBs are required for all AFSPC OT&E that supports fielding,
       operational acceptance, early operational use, trial period entry, or FRP decisions and
       may be required for other OT&E at the discretion of the requesting organization in
       coordination with the CCL and OTO. OT&E FRBs will be chaired by HQ AFSPC/A3
       unless delegated if the decision being supported is a fielding, operational acceptance,
       early operational use, trial period entry, or FRP. In cases in which an AFSPC OTO is
       conducting test activities and the appropriate decision authority is in an external
       organization, the CCL will coordinate the FRB through HQ AFSPC/A3 prior to external
       presentation. In all other cases, the FRB will be chaired by the requesting organization or
AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010                                                                     49


      as annotated in the Test Asset Support Request form. The FRB should normally be
      provided to the appropriate decision authority 30 days prior to the supported decision
      date. The FRB timeline will be determined and identified in the test plan and
      confirmation will be provided at the TRRB.
      6.3.1.4. OT&E Final Reports. Final Reports that are being used to support a fielding,
      operational acceptance, early operational use, trial period entry or FRP decision will be
      submitted to the appropriate decision maker no later than 30 days after the FRB.
      6.3.1.5. HQ AFSPC CCL Key Considerations for OT&E. If a fielding, operational
      acceptance, early operational use, trial period entry or FRP decision is being made in
      conjunction with the FRB/Final Report, in addition to the OTO-provided FRB/Final
      Report, the appropriate CCL, in coordination with the program office, will provide the
      decision authority, under separate cover but in support of the final FRB/ Final Report,
      any relevant concerns regarding system maturity, potential collateral effects or second-
      order effects of concern caused by system operation and any other information pertinent
      to the decision.
   6.3.2. Single Integrated DT&E/OT&E Test Reports. If a single integrated DT&E/OT&E
   Test Report is chosen to be used, the AFSPC OT&E Test Report approval authority level is
   maintained.
   6.3.3. Specialized Test/Assessment Reports. EMSEC testing, ELAs, Information
   Assurance Testing, and Telephonic Assessments. These individual activities will utilize the
   Test Asset Support Request process to include placement on TPL; however, 688 IOW and
   SIDC will dictate the format, content and level of coordination, approval and release
   authority of reports and report briefs.
   6.3.4. Interim Summary Reports. A written interim summary report is required in the
   event that a final report cannot be ready in time to meet established timelines. The T&E CL
   will help to identify a new final report due date; the results from any additional data collected
   will be added to the final report.
   6.3.5. Interim Status Reports. The test community will provide relevant, timely status
   reports to decision makers. Status reports identify and report technical maturation and
   performance and related impacts to test design, resources, infrastructure, and schedule. These
   reports may be integrated (one combined product from DT&E & OT&E) or non-integrated
   (separate DT&E or OT&E product), are event-driven, and are prepared as necessary after
   completion of significant program events. Interim Status Reports may be used in situations
   where a test is broken into discrete phases and the final test report will not be available for an
   extended period of time. Interim status reports may be in written or presentation form at the
   discretion of the decision authority. These reports may be signed at the squadron commander
   level. If this approach is used, the test organization will first coordinate with the T&E CL for
   applicability, concurrence and any additional requirements.
6.4. Deficiency Reports.
   6.4.1. AFSPC Systems. The Joint Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS) applies to AFSPC,
   contractor members and organizations who operate or sustain AFSPC-owned or managed
   systems, to include joint systems, subsystems, and end items; to include trainers, test and
   support equipment and vehicles. For all systems, JDRS shall be established, IAW TO 00-
 50                                                     AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010


   35D-54, not later than acquisition design baseline (Milestone B) and will continue
   throughout the system life cycle. HQ AFMC/LG may grant waivers on a case-by-case basis.
   Waiver requests will be coordinated through HQ AFSPC/A4/A7 who will make
   recommendations for waiver approval/disapproval. The ITT is responsible for generating a
   Deficiency Review Board (DRB) charter that documents key members, roles and specific
   processes. Testers will ensure Deficiency Reports (DR) validated during testing are entered
   into JDRS and the appropriate CCL is notified of JDRS tracking and resolution
   responsibilities. Validated IA deficiencies will also be assigned DRs for tracking and
   visibility as applicable.
   6.4.2. Joint Systems. Joint systems under test, operated and/or maintained by AFSPC will
   use these procedures to ensure commonality of reporting and resolution. The individual
   program office or lead service may establish specific reporting and resolution requirements
   over and above these requirements as long as those requirements are transparent to AFSPC
   users.
   6.4.3. Reporting Requirements. The test team will ensure all DRs are reported to the
   appropriate PM and HQ AFSPC/A3/A5/A6 CCLs. As a minimum, all CAT I through CAT II
   Urgent deficiencies will be included in final test reports. The appropriate HQ AFSPC/A3/A5
   CCL is responsible for tracking the resolution of DRs after the final test DRB. More
   information on deficiency reporting can be found in AFI 99-103 and TO 00-35D-54.
6.5. Distribution of Test Information. In addition to AFI 99-103 requirements, test
information will be published on the programs test data repository. DT&E reports and Final
Reports will be made available electronically to ITT Chairs, and all stakeholders (upon request).
Outside agencies may request test information from the T&E CL, who will coordinate with the
ITT Chairs, CCL and HQ AFSPC/A8/A9/PA regarding release.
6.6. Proprietary Information. Any proprietary information that is communicated to the test
team will not be transferred or communicated to any commercial organization or entity without
the documented permission of the originator in order to avoid penalties described in the Trade
Secrets Act, 18 USC 1902.
6.7. Archive Requirements. The appropriate knowledge owner (PM for program information,
OTO for test information) will ensure proper archive procedures are followed for each program.
The ITT co-chairs must take into account the need for rapid recall of T&E data for future use or
use by similar programs.
6.8. Prescribed Forms. This publication does not prescribe any forms.

Terms
Air Force Space Command System—Any system that is accepted/received by an AFSPC
authorized entity/office via the signing of a DD250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report or
is considered an AFSPC acquisition/sustainment program.
Capabilities-Based Testing—A mission-focused methodology of verifying that a capabilities
solution will enable operations at an acceptable level of risk. Capabilities-oriented evaluations
are emphasized throughout system testing in addition to traditional evaluations of system
performance measured against specification-like requirements. It requires understanding
CONOPS and involves developing T&E strategies and plans to determine whether a capability
solution option merits fielding.
Combined Test Force (CTF)—A method for testing systems as a continuum--throughout
acquisition and development and up to dedicated operational test. The CTF team is subordinate
to the ITT and led by a test professional. It is composed of key members representing the
Program Office, functional area, development, security, and others with a test interest in a
project. Additionally, AFOTEC representatives and/or SIDC-appointed operational testers will
participate as members for any project with operational test requirements. CTF members are
active participants in all test activities, and use their corporate knowledge to focus integrated
team efforts on management, planning and preparation, testing, evaluation and reporting of all
Development Test. The CTF may culminate with DT&E, or it may continue in a support role
with the Operational Tester conducting operational testing.
Critical Operational Issue (COI)—1. Operational effectiveness and operational suitability
issues (not parameters, objectives, or thresholds) that must be examined during operational
testing to determine the system’s capability to perform its mission. (paraphrased from DAU’s
Test and Evaluation Management Guide) 2. A key question that must be examined in OT&E to
determine the system’s capability to perform its mission. Testers normally phrase a COI as a
question to be answered in evaluating a system’s operational effectiveness or suitability.
AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010                                                                        59


Cyberspace System—An AFSPC cyberspace system is one assigned to AFSPC and used for the
special purpose of defense of the cyber domain, operations of the cyber domain and delivered for
use to force providers.
Deficiency Report (DR)—The report used to identify, document, and track system deficiency or
enhancement data while a system is in advanced development, operational test, or operational
transition.
Category I deficiencies are those which may cause death, severe injury, or severe occupational
illness; may cause loss or major damage to a weapon system; critically restricts the combat
readiness capabilities of the using organization; or result in a production line stoppage.
Category II deficiencies are those that impede or constrain successful mission accomplishment
(system impacts OSS&E but does not meet the safety or mission impact criteria of a Category I
deficiency).
Detailed Test Plan (DTP)—Detailed test plans generally cover a single test activity specified in
the ITC, but may be developed to cover multiple, related test activities, such as dry runs and
formal testing.
At a minimum each detailed test plan will contain: A description of the SUT, to include the
basic system design, specific modifications, test specific configurations (including critical
changes for instrumentation), system interfaces with support and collateral assets, and (as
appropriate) safeguards to isolate the SUT from the real world.

The detailed test plan will also identify criteria for starting, pausing, stopping, and restarting the
test. Also it will identify specific individuals/positions that have the authority to start, pause,
stop, and restart the test, including thresholds for various levels of required approval.
Developmental Test and Evaluation—T&E conducted to evaluate design approaches, validate
analytical models, quantify contract technical performance and manufacturing quality, measure
progress in system engineering design and development, minimize design risks, predict
integrated system operational performance (effectiveness and suitability) in the intended
environment, and identify system problems (or deficiencies) to allow for early and timely
resolution. DT&E includes contractor testing and is conducted over the life of the system to
support acquisition and sustainment efforts. (Defense Acquisition Guidebook)
Dry Run—Dry runs are a process in which a test team verifies that their test procedures and
scenarios function as intended and are likely to collect sufficient data to meet test objectives.
Experiment—A scientific, technological, or developmental investigation or test. An experiment
may include several instrument packages from the same or different sponsoring agencies. A
given payload may include several experiments from the same or different sponsoring agencies.
They may be primary or secondary mission experiments.
Fielding—The decision to release a system for operational use by units in the field or fleet.
Fit—The “mating” characteristics of an item that allow it to physically interface or interconnect
with or become an integral part of another item. Note: limited to hardware items.
Force Development Evaluation (FDE)—The OT&E of fielded, operational systems during the
sustainment portion of the system life cycle after acceptance for operational use. The focus is on
 60                                                      AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010


maintaining or upgrading operational systems after the initial acquisition process is complete. An
FDE may also support acquisition of AFSPC-managed systems.
Form—The defined configuration, including the geometrically measured configuration, density,
and weight or other visual shape/size parameter that uniquely characterize the physical
characteristics of an item. Note: limited to hardware items.
Function—The action or actions that an item is designed to perform and must be capable of
doing for a defined set of conditions. Note: may apply to hardware and/or software items.
High Performance Team (HPT)—The HPT is the preferred method to (quickly) develop an
ICD, Stage I, ICD, Stage II, CDD, or CPD, and is used unless waived by AF/A3R at the RSR.
An HPT consists of a lead (normally the sponsor), core and support team members. (AFI 10-
601).
Installation and Checkout (I&C)—AFSPC units conduct I&C to support the operational
acceptance of sustaining engineering activities and processing equipment swaps covered by
operational technical manuals and checklists. I&C activities are also appropriate for routine
updates to operational databases which do not directly affect or have the potential to affect
mission accomplishment and following maintenance of software that does not add new
capabilities to the system (e.g., maintenance releases, database changes, COTS updates).
Additionally, I&C activities may be used to support acceptance of Program Office modifications
being installed at multiple sites after the initial site passes a successful OT&E.
Integrated Test Team (ITT)—A cross-functional team of empowered representatives from
multiple disciplines and organizations and co-chaired by operational testers and the program
management representative. The ITT is responsible for developing the TES and TEMP, assisting
the acquisition community with T&E matters, and guiding the development of integrated test
plans. There is one cognizant ITT for each acquisition program. ITTs are responsible for
ensuring testers collaborate to minimize the amount of resources, time and cost required to meet
program objectives. The results of this collaboration will be evident in the TES/TEMP and
associated ITCs. ITTs will also ensure test teams plan for contingencies such as lack of test
squadron support or operational asset availability. These steps will minimize required changes to
program ITCs.
Integrated Testing—Any combination of two or more types of testing used to achieve greater
test efficiency, reduced cost, and schedule savings without compromising the objectives and
needs of the participating test organizations.
Lead Test Organization (LTO)—Test organization with the responsibility for coordinating
actions leading to planning, executing and reporting on test activities involving multiple test
organizations. The LTO may be lead for a team consisting of more than one service, command or
testing discipline (DT&E/OT&E).
Measure of Effectiveness (MOE)—A qualitative or quantitative measure of a system's
performance or a characteristic that indicates the degree to which it performs the task or meets a
requirement under specified conditions. MOEs should be established to measure the system’s
capability to produce or accomplish the desired result.
AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010                                                                     61


Measure of Performance (MOP)—A quantitative measure of a system’s capability to
accomplish a task. Typically in the area of physical performance (e.g., range, velocity,
throughput, payload).
Measure of Suitability (MOS)—A qualitative or quantitative measure of a system suitability
parameter; that is, one which could impact reliability, maintainability, availability, logistics,
supportability, training, etc. It is not mandatory to use MOSs in a TEMP, but if they aren’t there,
the MOEs should adequately cover all suitability requirements.
Operational Effectiveness—Measure of the overall ability to accomplish a mission when used
by representative personnel in the environment planned or expected for operational employment
of the system considering organization, doctrine, tactics, supportability, survivability,
vulnerability and threat. (CJCSI 3170.01F)
Operational Suitability—The degree to which a system can be placed satisfactorily in field use
with consideration given to availability, compatibility, transportability, interoperability,
reliability, wartime usage rates, maintainability, safety, human factors, manpower supportability,
logistics supportability, natural environmental effects and impacts, documentation and training
requirements. (CJCSI 3170.01F)
Operational Test—AFSPC Operational test is defined as any test or test support activity
conducted by an OTO. OT&E may also be used to assess and report on a system’s maturity and
potential to meet operational requirements. Types of test that require TPL submissions are OAs,
OUEs, FDEs and SOTRs. 346 TS Cyberspace technology assessments (TSSAP, EMSEC and
IPv6 Information Assurance Support activities conducted by the 346 TS) are a subset of OA.
They are low risk assessments of current or evolving technology. Cyberspace technology
assessment test documentation and TRRBs that fall under the definition of low risk will be
coordinated and chaired at the Group or Squadron level. Military Utility Assessments (MUA)
and any other assessment activities other than those listed above are not operational test activities
and cannot be used to support fielding, operational acceptance, early operational use, trial period
entry or FRP decisions.
Operational Test Agency (OTA)—An independent agency reporting directly to the Service
Chief that plans and conducts operational tests, reports results, and provides evaluations of
effectiveness and suitability on new systems. (DoDD 5000.01) Note: Each Service has one
designated OTA: The Air Force has the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center
(AFOTEC). The Navy has the Operational Test and Evaluation Force (OPTEVFOR). The Army
has the Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC). The Marine Corps has the Marine Corps
Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA).
Operational Test Organization—The generic term for any organization that conducts
operational testing as stated in its mission directive. For AFSPC, OTOs are those organizations
specifically identified in this instruction.
Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E)—A generic term describing the T&E options and
levels of effort available to an operational test organization. Within AFSPC operational test is
also defined as any test or test support activity conducted by an OTO.
Participating Test Organization (PTO)—Any test organization required to support a lead test
organization by providing specific T&E data or resources for a T&E program or activity.
 62                                                      AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010


Program Manager (PM)—1. The designated individual with responsibility for and authority to
accomplish program objectives for development, production, and sustainment to meet the user’s
operational needs. The PM shall be accountable for credible cost, schedule, and performance
reporting to the MDA. (DoDD 5000.01) 2. Applies collectively to system program directors,
product group managers, single managers, acquisition program managers, and weapon system
managers. Operating as the single manager, the PM has total life cycle system management
authority. Note: This AFSPCI also uses the term “PM” for any designated person in charge of
acquisition activities prior to MS A (i.e., before a technology project is officially designated an
acquisition program).
Responsible Test Organization—The lead government developmental test organization on the
ITT that is qualified to conduct and responsible for overseeing DT&E.
Safety Review Board—The SRB will review the test products (e.g., test plan, test and collateral
risk assessments, failure modes and effects analyses) and presentation to validate or revise the
final safety risk level for the test. The SRB assesses whether the T&E project's safety plan has
identified and mitigated all health and safety hazards according to AFI 91-301, Air Force
Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection and Health (AFOSH) Program, a
Programmatic Environmental, Safety, and Health Evaluation (PESHE) review according to RM
principles, and an environmental impacts/compliance/pollution prevention IAW federal, state
and local environmental laws.
Space System—A system with a major functional component that operates in the space
environment or which, by convention (e.g., ground-based sensors), is so designated. It usually
includes a space element, a link element, and a terrestrial element. However, a space system may
also consist of components that travel between space modes: space to ground, ground to space,
or ground to ground through space.
System Safety—The principle objective of a system safety program is to ensure safety,
consistent with mission requirement, is included in technology development and designed into
systems, subsystems, equipment, facilities, and their interfaces and operation.
Sustainment—1. The provision of personnel, logistic, and other support required to maintain
and prolong operations or combat until successful accomplishment or revision of the mission or
of the national objective. (JP 1-02) 2. The Service's ability to maintain operations once forces
are engaged. (AFDD 12, Air Force Glossary) 3. Activities that sustain systems during the
operations and support phases of the system life cycle. Such activities include any investigative
T&E that extends the useful military life of systems, or expands the current performance
envelope or capabilities of fielded systems. Sustainment activities also include T&E for
modifications and upgrade programs, and may disclose system or product deficiencies and
enhancements that make further acquisitions necessary.
Technical Review Board (TRB)—The TRB will review the following as applicable: enabling
concepts; test personnel composition; training and proficiency requirements for testers, operators
and maintainers; logistics requirements to include test items and infrastructure; RM&A
approaches; system up/downtime to support testing; system hardware/software maturity;
capabilities being tested or specified requirements; software, hardware and network baselines;
and schedules. The TRB chair will review test products (e.g., test plan, test measures and
methods, detailed test procedures, operational risk assessments) to evaluate the technical
complexity and risk of the test program and determine the need for a formal board. The TRB
AFSPCI99-103 29 DECEMBER 2010                                                                   63


chair will review the test products, presentation and inputs from other board members (if
applicable) to validate or revise the final risk level for the test. The TRB will ensure that
environmental analyses have been completed as required by AFI 32-7061, The Environmental
Impact Analysis Process, and referenced in the test plan. Additionally, the TRB will assess
Operational Security (OPSEC), Communication Security (COMSEC) and Information Security
(INFOSEC) concerns. The TRB can occur as soon as the TRB chair is satisfied that sufficient
test planning detail exists to determine technical adequacy and validity of the plan’s ability to
meet test objectives and determine overall test risk.
Test Director (TD)—A person holding an organizational position charged with overseeing
testing or test activities.
Test Manager (TM)—The individual(s) identified by the commander of the test organization to
act as the focal point for overall test planning, test conduct and reporting on the test program.
The commander of the test organization will appoint the TM and ensure the rank is
commensurate with the risk associated with the testing. The TM has overall responsibility for the
safe conduct of the test.
Test Readiness Review Board (TRRB)—The TRRB is a meeting to determine the readiness to
begin executing test activities. While the format and structure of the TRRB is at the discretion of
the approval authority, TRRBs should, as applicable, confirm the following: approved detailed
test plan, test team, operators and maintainers are ready to support to include test specific and
system operations training; all safety aspects have been addressed and residual risks have been
accepted at the appropriate level; test halt procedures with associated criteria established and
trained; TRB and SRB recommendations and resolutions, configuration management processes
in place; and significant DRs have been resolved.
Test Support Manager (TSM)—The individual(s) identified at the wing or unit level that
supports the test organization and/or LTO in planning and conducting the test. The TSM is
assigned from operational units supporting the test activity and serves as a liaison between the
operational unit and the test organization/LTO. The TSM will support the testing process from
test planning through reporting.
Test Team—A group of testers and other experts who carry out integrated testing according to a
specific test plan. Note: A combined test force is one way to organize a test team for integrated
testing.
