This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-10, Installations and
Facilities. It outlines the policy, procedures, responsibilities, and technical standards for the
recognition of United States Air Force (USAF) Mechanical Skilled Persons at United States Air
Force in Europe (USAFE) Installations in the United Kingdom (UK). It applies to Base Civil
Engineers and United States (US) supporting agencies conducting Mechanical work. This
instruction highlights training requirements necessary to understand host nation code
requirements, by AFI 32-1068, Heating Systems and Unfired Pressure Vessels, the electrical safe
practices as required by AFI 32-1064, Electrical Safe Practices, compliance with the substantive
provisions of UK law as incorporated by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) Joint Services
Publication (JSP) 375 Volume 3, Chapter 4 “Mechanical Systems”, JSP 375 Volume 3, Chapter
2 “Common Requirements” and City and Guilds Certificate 2078, Handling Refridgerants
certificate for handling refrigerants. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in AF Records Managements System (AFRIMS) at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61/afrims/afrims/index.cfm.
1. Background.
   1.1. UK law and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) Joint Services Publication (JSP) 375
   Volume 3, Chapter 2, “Common Requirements” states that to be eligible for appointment,
2                                                 USAFEI32-1015 1 DECEMBER 2008


    prospective Skilled Persons (Mechanical) are to meet the requirements of JSP 375 Volume 3
    Chapter 2 and are to have an appropriate qualifications in a relevant discipline. Skilled
    Persons (Mechanical) are required to have successfully undertaken technical training as
    determined by the Coordinating Authorized Person (CAP) to meet the needs of his site and
    the tasks on USAF installations in the United Kingdom to be approved as Mechanical Skilled
    Persons.
    1.2. UK Law requires “persons to be competent to prevent danger and injury.”
    Furthermore, it states “no person shall be engaged in any work activity where technical
    knowledge or experience is necessary to prevent danger or, where appropriate, injury unless
    he possesses such knowledge or experience, or is under such degree of supervision as may be
    appropriate having regard to the nature of the work.” AFI 32-1064, Electrical Safe
    Practices, states “Employees should be assigned to jobs they are capable of doing safely.
    Permit only qualified personnel to operate equipment and machinery. Supervisors should
    train employees to comply with host nation codes.”
    1.3. JSP 375 requires prospective Mechanical Skilled Persons to have an adequate
    knowledge of Volume 3, Chapter 2 and 4, including emergency First Aid and Fire Training.
    1.4. The majority of the Mechanical Systems on USAF bases in the UK are being
    maintained by UK personnel. Without a Skilled Person’s certificate, US Civil Engineer (CE)
    personnel are not recognized as skilled person’s and are restricted from working on any
    system unless their work is supervised by a skilled person. Differences were identified
    between UK and US regulations concerning Mechanical Systems and a joint USAF and UK
    Defence Estates working group met to provide guidance applicable to USAF installations in
    the UK. This instruction is the result of that consultation.
