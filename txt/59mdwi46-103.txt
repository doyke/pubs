This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 46-1, Nursing Services, and
4N0X1/B/C/F Career Field Education and Training Plans (CFETP). The prevailing goal of the
assignment and rotation process is to ensure all assigned Aerospace Medical Service Specialist
(4N0) personnel are provided an opportunity for positive and deliberate career development
through a variety of rotational work assignments. At the same time, we must also ensure mission
requirements are met equitably by placing the right number of personnel in the right job at the
right time. This medical wing instruction (MDWI) outlines guidance for movement of personnel
assigned to the 59th Medical Wing (MDW) to meet these goals. This instruction applies to all
personnel assigned or attached to the 59 MDW. This instruction does not apply to the Air
National Guard or Air Force Reserve. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication. Requests for waivers must be submitted to the OPR listed above for
consideration and approval. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in

2. Assignment Policies and Procedures.
   2.1. General Information.
      2.1.1. Due to the diverse nature of the 4N0 career field, an effective rotation plan for
      assigned personnel is critical in meeting dynamic health care delivery requirements.
      Importance will be placed on ensuring deliberate force development at both tactical and
      operational levels to better manage capability.
      2.1.2. The standard tour length recommendation for 4N0X1 personnel is 36 months.
      Group commanders in collaboration with Group FM reserve the authority to shorten or
      extend tour length to meet mission requirements.
      2.1.3. Personnel assigned to the 59 MDW staffed in AFSC-neutral positions should
      rotate after 18 months unless mission needs dictate otherwise or any other position
      outside of 4N0 career path/duties (i.e. matrix positions, MDG Unit Training Manager,
      additional duty First Sergeants, etc).
      2.1.4. All tour length extension reviews should include consideration of the overall
      staffing (i.e., authorizations versus assigned) as well as skill level mix (3/5/7), mission
      needs and any other special circumstances (SEI, extensive training, etc.).
   2.2. Initial Assignment of Personnel.
      2.2.1. Group FM or senior 4N0 with group CN and group/squadron superintendent
      coordination, will allocate inbound personnel to work centers based on mission
      requirements, individual career-broadening opportunities, and when possible, individual
      desires. When making assignments, the number of personnel authorized/assigned,
      projected losses/gains, workload, and skill level mix should be considered.
      2.2.2. Prior to arrival, the group FM or senior 4N0 should provide inbound personnel
      with an individual preference worksheet (Attachment 2) and the 4N0 Duty Position
      Matrix (Attachment 3) to indicate their assignment preference via email.
   2.3. Longevity moves, intra-group, and inter-group transfer of personnel.
4                                                   59MDWI46-103 30 SEPTEMBER 2014


    2.3.1. Personnel will be selected for longevity moves based on their date of assignment
    to their duty section. All moves/transfers are based on mission continuity, retainability,
    merit, and when possible, individual desires.
       2.3.1.1. Personnel should complete an individual preference worksheet to indicate
       their assignment preferences. Group FM and/or senior 4N0 should consider desired
       location to meet career development and mission requirements along with mission
       needs for placement.
    2.3.2. Intra-group: Group FM and/or senior 4N0 may recommend intra-group transfer to
    the group/squadron superintendents in order to accommodate mission requirements.
    Group FM and/or senior 4N0 may exercise intra-group transfers with
    coordination/approval of Squadron Commander or designee. 959 MDG FM will also
    collaborate with Department/Section Leadership.
    2.3.3. Inter-group: Group FM and/or senior 4N0, in collaboration with their
    group/squadron superintendents will coordinate possible move with gaining group FM
    and or senior 4N0, group/squadron superintendents. If decision to move is approved by
    the Squadron CC, the losing squadron superintendent/group FM and/or senior 4N0 will
    coordinate with group SGA and personnel center. The group SGA and personnel center
    will only complete action after receiving the no-cost or fully-funded PCS paperwork that
    has been completed and approved by the losing and gaining groups.
       2.3.3.1. If the inter-group move is to or from 959 MDG, a no-cost PCS will be loaded
       by Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC). Member will receive official orders.
       2.3.3.2. If the inter-group move is to or from 359 MDG, a low-cost or fully-funded
       PCS will be loaded by AFPC. Member will receive official orders.
       2.3.3.3. If the inter-group move is within JBSA-Lackland, a Personnel Action
       Change worksheet is required.
    2.3.4. Senior noncommissioned officers (SNCOs) may request to rotate prior to
    completing longevity norms in their current duty location. SNCOs are encouraged to
    seek the versatility required at the senior levels of enlisted leadership. All requests must
    be approved with group/squadron superintendents.
    2.3.5. Reasons that may prevent an individual from participating in a longevity move
    include, but are not limited to, the following: unfavorable information files, control roster
    action and/or documented poor performance, etc. Group superintendents from the losing
    and gaining organizations, in consultation with group FM and or senior 4N0 and first
    sergeants (for QFI), should carefully review these moves and seek input/advice from
    wing 4N FM. Ultimately; the gaining group commander will decide whether or not to
    accept individuals with negative quality force indicators. In cases where it is determined
    the individual will not be considered for an inter-group move, the individual will remain
    within his/her current unit of assignment until the situation is rectified.
    2.3.6. Other circumstances that may preclude a move include individuals with less than
    12 months retainability on station for any of the following reasons: permanent change of
    station orders or approved retraining, separation or retirement date. Individuals falling in
59MDWI46-103 30 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                            5


     these categories will not be considered for rotation unless the gaining group
     superintendent agrees to accept them.
     2.3.7. Deployed individuals who are due to rotate may rotate within 90 days of return
     from deployment using the same approval process as other longevity moves.
     2.3.8. The wing FM will address any extenuating circumstances that necessitate
     unscheduled reassignment (i.e. change in mission requirements, promotions to ensure
     duties are commensurate with skill-level progression, removal in the case of poor
     performance, etc).
     2.3.9. Personnel may submit an application for a corps-neutral position; however, prior
     coordination with the group/wing FM is required.
