SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This revision replaces all references to Inquires and Complaints Office (HQ ARPC/IGO), with
Directorate of Personnel Transformation, Operations Division (DPTG). It replaces all references
to HQ USAF/REPX with HQ USAF/REI. It redesignates the responding directorate from OPR
to action office (Paragraph 3.1). It deletes the requirement to provide microfiche records when a
congressional inquiry is hand-carried to the action office (paragraph 3.1). It changes the
requirement to obtain military personnel records from the National Personnel Records Center

(NPRC) prior to forwarding the congressional inquiry to the action office (paragraph 3.3). It
makes AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, a requirement (paragraph 3.4.1). It changes the
format for the proposed response to a congressional inquiry (paragraph 3.4.2). It deletes the
requirement to explain an extension in the Staff Summary Sheet (paragraph 3.6). It changes the
manner of transmission of a proposed response to AF/RE from fax to e-mail (paragraphs 4.1, 4.4,
and 5.1). It adds the requirement to forward proposed response and Staff Summary Sheet to
ARPC/CC or CV for coordination and approval (paragraph 4.3).
1. Reference. AFI 90-401.
2. Policy. The Directorate of Personnel Transformation, Operations Division, is the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) for all Congressional/High-Level Inquiries addressed to ARPC.
3. Procedure.
     3.1. When DPTG receives a Congressional/High-Level Inquiry, it will be suspensed to the
     appropriate directorate. If more than one directorate is required to take action, DPTG will
     designate the directorate that is to be the action office to obtain, consolidate, and prepare the
     response. The original document and one copy of ARPC Suspense Tracking Sheet, is hand-
     carried to the action office by DPTG. DPTG keeps one copy of ARPC Suspense Tracking
     Sheet and a record copy of the correspondence in suspense control. If a different directorate
     is determined to be the action office, the inquiry must be hand-carried or emailed back to
     DPTG for rerouting.
     3.2. All written Congressional/High Level Inquiries will be reviewed by DPTG. Those
     inquiries that have been clearly misrouted (i.e., Army, ANG, AFRC, active duty issues) will
     be returned to HQ USAF/REI by DPTG. Upon receipt of any other inquiry which the action
     office determines to be misrouted, that office will forward by e-mail to DPTG (1) why ARPC
     cannot respond to the subject issue, (2) an organization/address to which inquiry should be
     rerouted. DPTG will forward the e-mail/message to AF/REI to clear the suspense for ARPC.
     3.3. DPTG will obtain the military personnel records from the National Personnel Records
     Center, (NPRC) when requested by the action office.
     3.4. The action office prepares a reply, coordinates it with all directorates with an interest in
     the matter and hand-carries or emails to DPTG by the suspense date. AF Form 1768, Staff
     Summary Sheet signed by the Director/Deputy Director, or in their absence, a designated
     representative.
        3.4.1. Proposed response to Congressional/High-Level Inquiry in the appropriate format
        (Attachment 2).
        3.4.2. Original inquiry document.
     3.5. DPTG will ensure all inquiries are coordinated with ARPC/JA. The office of primary
     responsibility is encouraged to informally consult with JA prior to drafting the response to
     assess legal implications.
     3.6. Extensions. Unless otherwise indicated, Directorates will be given a 3-workday
     suspense to respond to all Congressional/High Level Inquiries. To obtain an extension of
     suspense (date/time) the OPR will e-mail DPTG with the request for a new suspense date and
     the reason. DPTG will in turn forward the message to AF/REI to request approval for new
     suspense date change.

4. Responses to HQ USAF/REI.
   4.1. DPTG responds to inquiries received from HQ USAF/REI, by e-mail. DPTG will
   request an extension from HQ USAF/REI by e-mail when a suspense cannot be met.
   4.2. DPTG will review the proposed response for content and format. If all issues are not
   addressed or response is not in the correct format, DPTG will return it to the issuing
   Directorate.
   4.3. DPTG will forward proposed response and AF Form 1768 to ARPC/CC or CV for
   coordination and approval.
   4.4. Upon receipt of a proposed response which has been approved for release by the ARPC
   commander, DPTG will e-mail the proposed response to USAF/REI and return the file copy
   to the appropriate Directorate.
5. Directorate Inquiries.
   5.1. If a Directorate receives a Congressional/High Level Inquiry from another Agency (i.e.,
   AFPC, NPRC, SAF/LL, Congressional Office), the correspondence will immediately be
   hand-carried to DPTG. DPTG will immediately e-mail copies of the inquiry to HQ
   USAF/REI with a target completion date. DPTG will then process the inquiry in accordance
   with paragraph 3.
   5.2. Telephone Inquiries: Any congressional inquiry received by telephone in the Reserve
   Personnel Contact Center, or by any office, will be referred to DPTG for processing in
   accordance with paragraph 3.

     PROPOSED RESPONSE FOR REPLY TO CONGRESSIONAL/HIGH-LEVEL
                             INQUIRY

PROPOSED RESPONSE FOR CONGRESSMAN PUBLIC
REGARDING CHIEF MASTER SERGEANT BRENDA WHOEVER


    This is in response to your inquiry for CMSgt Brenda Whoever regarding her request for a
retired pay application packet.

  CMSgt Whoever is eligible to apply for Reserve retired pay under the provision of Title 10,
United States Code (U.S.C.), Section 12731, effective on January 7, 2006, her 60th birthday. The
Air Reserve Personnel Center Retirement Division normally sends the pay application packet out
approximately 4 months prior to the member’s 60th birthday. Once we receive the pay
application packet, the DFAS pay system allows us to update the retired pay no earlier than 45
days prior to the member’s 60th birthday. Since CMSgt Whoever’s 60th birthday is in January
2006, her pay forms would normally have been sent to her in September 2005. In fact, the pay
application packet was mailed to the member on September 16, 2005.

   Once we receive this information back from CMSgt Whoever, we will initiate all actions
necessary to ensure she receives her retirement pay on time.
