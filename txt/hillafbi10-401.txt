1. Concept of Operations. Under the following circumstances, Hill AFB will be used as a deployed site:
   1.1. The unit is deploying in order to engage in Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) activities,
   air-to-air or air-to-ground.
2                                                                 HILLAFBI10-401 5 OCTOBER 2004


    1.2. The unit is deploying for test and training purposes that are not directly related to UTTR utiliza-
    tion.
    1.3. The unit is using Hill AFB as an arrival or departure airfield.
    1.4. The unit is using Hill AFB in order to support 388 FW flying operations.
    1.5. The unit is using Hill AFB in order to support 419 FW flying operations.
    1.6. The unit is using Hill AFB in order to support 514th Flight Test Squadron flying operations.
    1.7. Det.1, 86 Fighter Weapons Squadron (A/G WSEP, “Combat Hammer”).

2. Deploying Unit Responsibilities.
    2.1. Establish a point of contact within the 75th Logistics Readiness Squadron, Contingency Planning
    and Training (75LRS/LGRRP, DSN: 777-6796) and submit the OO-ALC IMT 510, Deployment
    Request, no later than 45 days prior to scheduled arrival date at Hill AFB if not dropping live ord-
    nance. NOTE: Units requiring munitions support (i.e. storage and maintenance) must submit their
    munitions support requirements to 75 LRS/LGRRP (email: mailto:75LRS/DCC@hill.af.mil or Fax
    DSN: 777-7226) no later than 120 days prior to arrival. This notification is required to ensure ade-
    quate munitions storage and maintenance space is available.
       2.1.1. The OO-ALC IMT 510 and the signed request to conduct live munitions operations (see
       sample memo on Attachment 2) may be e-mailed to mailto:75LRS/DCC@hill.af.mil, faxed to
       DSN: 777-7226 or mailed to 75 LRS/LGRRP, 7520 Wardleigh Rd. Hill AFB, UT 84056.
    2.2. Submit Obligation Authority for services rendered using one of the following funding documents
    (1) AF IMT 616, Fund Cite Authorization (FCA)
    http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/forms/formlist.asp?puborg=AF&series=0600-0699
    or (2) DD Form 448, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request
    http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/ddforms1-499.htm.
    2.3. Indicate on the funding document that it is for civilian overtime for airlift management, loading,
    and unloading. Units or organizations planning to fly mission originating or terminating at Hill AFB
    must schedule all flying operations within published airfield operating hours (0800 – 2200 local Mon-
    day – Thursday, 0800 – 1800 Friday and 1000 – 1800 Saturday/Sunday).
    2.4. All general-purpose vehicles required should be rented. U-Drive-It vehicles cannot be guaran-
    teed. Vehicle requirements over and above organic capability will necessitate unit funding and negoti-
    ating with General Services Administration (GSA) Interagency Motor Pool, or contacting a local
    commercial rental firm. This should be accomplished prior to arrival to ensure availability of required
    vehicles.
    2.5. Contact the Airfield Manager (Airfield Management (75 OSS/OSAM), DSN 586-6003) to
    receive an airfield safety brief. Obtain an aircrew briefing from the host flying organization. Briefings
    will address safety, noise abatement, security, airfield familiarization and flight line driving.
    2.6. Units must deploy with a weather forecaster to provide specialized weather support.
    2.7. Units will coordinate with the 775 Civil Engineer Squadron Readiness Flight (775 CEG/CEX,
    Disaster Preparedness, DSN 777-4184 or 777-4185) to develop clear command and control responsi-
    bilities for any disaster requiring Disaster Control Group (DCG) response.

   mercial surface mode, must contact EG&G (DSN: 777-6117) to arrange surface transportation as soon
   as possible after arrival at Hill AFB.

3. Tasked Organizations. OO-ALC IMT 510: http://www.hill.af.mil/scsweb/pdl/300_599.htm will
be sent to Department of Defense (DOD) units who wish to deploy to or through Hill AFB. Data obtained

4. Intelligence. All intelligence information intended for use by the deploying unit, real world or exer-
cise, will be provided to the appropriate individuals by the unit hosting the deployment as required.
