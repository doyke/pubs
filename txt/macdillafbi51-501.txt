          medical care or base access until a new ID card is obtained. ID cards of active duty military
          personnel and reservists on orders will not be seized.
          2.1.2.3. Gather all available evidence including but not limited to video tapes, photographs of

           time required by 6 SFS local file plan.
           2.1.2.6. Within seven days of the incident, 6 SFS will deliver a completed report of investiga-
           tion to 6 AMW/JA. The report of investigation should include, at a minimum:
               2.1.2.6.1. An AF Form 3545, Report of Incident;

    failure to obey a lawful order in violation of Article 92, UCMJ. Civilians will be handled administra-
    tively, i.e., possible barment from MacDill AFB.
    2.3. Subjects who receive a Notice of Revocation of AAFES/DeCA Privileges may request adminis-
    trative review of the revocation by following the procedures outlined in the Notice of Revocation at
    Attachment 4 for military members and Attachment 5 for civilians. To be considered for an admin-
    istrative review, requests supporting statements and documentation must be received within 10 calen-
    dar days of the date of incident. Late requests will not be considered.
    2.4. In cases where the subject requests an administrative review, 6 SFS will prepare a package that
    includes the incident report and supporting documentation outlined in 2.1.2.6. above and any addi-
    tional evidence submitted by the subject requesting the administrative review. The 6 SFS will staff the
    administrative review request through 6 AMW/JA to 6 MSG/CC for a final determination.

3. 6 AMW/JA Responsibilities.
    3.1. Review incident reports provided by 6 SFS and make a case disposition determination. Disposi-
    tion options for civilian subjects include:
       3.1.1. Refer the case to the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Florida (U.S. Attor-
       ney) with a recommendation for criminal prosecution;
MACDILLAFBI51-501 18 JANUARY 2008                                                                       5


      3.1.2. Refer the case to the U.S. Attorney with a recommendation that the subject be offered the
      opportunity to participate in the U.S. Attorney Pretrial Diversion (PTD) Program;
      3.1.3. Prosecute the case as a misdemeanor theft in Federal Magistrate Court;
      3.1.4. Offer the subject the opportunity to participate in the MacDill PTD Program. (Note: This
      program was established in 2000 with the concurrence of the U.S. Attorney and Installation Com-
      mander at MacDill); or,
      3.1.5. Determine the facts and circumstances do not support the charged offense.
   3.2. When 6 AMW/JA receives an incident report for a military subject, 6 AMW/JA will review the
   facts and circumstances of the case and provide advice on disposition to the military member’s com-
   mander.
   3.3. In cases where 6 AMW/JA pursues prosecution, a judge advocate designated by the U.S. Attor-
   ney to act as a Special Assistant United States Attorney (SAUSA) will prosecute misdemeanor thefts
   committed by civilian subjects in Federal Magistrate Court.
   3.4. If it is determined that it is in the best interest of the government and judicial process, 6 AMW/
   JA will refer appropriate suspects for entry into PTD programs as follows:
      3.4.1. For high dollar theft or employee theft, the subject may be referred to the U.S. Attorney’s
      office for placement into a PTD program. 6 AMW/JA will ensure appropriate documentation is
      provided for program placement and will monitor the case until successful completion of the
      diversionary period.
      3.4.2. The MacDill Pretrial Diversion (PTD) program was established to provide an alternative to
      prosecution. Civilian subjects who are offered and voluntarily agree to participate in the program
      agree to pay AAFES the civil forfeiture and must complete a specified number of community ser-
      vice hours. Civilian subjects who are authorized AAFES/DeCA patrons and who successfully
      complete the program will be authorized immediate reinstatement of their AAFES/DeCA privi-
      leges. 6 AMW/JA will provide a memorandum to those who successfully complete the program
      authorizing reinstatement of AAFES/DeCA privileges. Civilian subjects MUST present the mem-
      orandum to Pass and ID to obtain an Armed Forces Identification Card that allows access to
      AAFES/DeCA before entering any AAFES/DeCA facility.
      3.4.3. Civilian subjects who decline the opportunity to participate in a PTD program or who fail
      to complete any pretrial program are subject to prosecution on the underlying misconduct or other
      administrative actions.
   3.5. Requests for Administrative Review to Reinstate AAFES/DeCA Privileges:
      3.5.1. When 6 SFS/SFAR forwards a request for administrative review, 6 AMW/JA will review
      the investigation and any additional information submitted by the subject requesting the review. 6
      AMW/JA will make a disposition recommendation to 6 MSG/CC as to whether the revocation
      should be upheld or whether privileges should be reinstated.

4. 6 MSG/CC Responsibilities.
   4.1. Provide signed copies of the Notice of Revocation of Exchange (AAFES)/Commissary (DeCA)
   Privileges and Lawful Order Not to Use Any AAFES or DeCA Facilities letters to 6 SFS for use in
   appropriate situations.
6                                                          MACDILLAFBI51-501 18 JANUARY 2008


    4.2. Upon notification by 6 SFS or 6 AMW/JA that a subject has committed two or more shoplifting
    offenses in a five year period, issue a permanent revocation of privileges. In an unusual case, the sub-
    ject’s privileges may be reinstated after 24 months, provided the claim for damages is fully paid to
    AAFES, the case is not pending on a Federal Magistrate Court docket, the offender has completed any
    diversion action, and the offender makes a request for reinstatement in writing with justification for
    the reinstatement within 10 days of completion of any program or criminal proceeding. Requests must
    be coordinated with 6 AMW/JA for a disposition recommendation and with 6 MSG/CC as the final
    approving authority.
    4.3. Review requests submitted within ten 10 calendar days of incident for administrative review of
    requests to reinstate AAFES/DeCA privileges and make a determination as to whether privileges
    should be reinstated or whether the revocation should be upheld. Provide 6 AMW/JA and subject
    notice of the final decision. An administrative review is not a personal appearance; it is a review of the
    information submitted by the alleged offender to determine whether their AAFES/DeCA privileges
    should be reinstated or the duration of the revocation should be modified. In either event, it does not
    stop criminal prosecution.
    4.4. Adopted Forms/IMTs: AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; AF Form
    1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness/Complainant; AF Form 3545, Report of Incident; DD Form 1173,

SUBJECT: Demand for Payment of Damages Subsequent to Apprehension for Shoplifting
1. You were detained for shoplifting at the MacDill Air Force Base Army and Air Force
Exchange Service (AAFES). Florida State Statute Section 772.11, Civil Remedy for Theft or
Exploitation, authorizes a merchant to demand a civil remedy in the amount of $200.00 when
there is clear and convincing evidence that the merchant has been injured as a result of a retail
theft.
2. AAFES hereby demands that you pay damages in the amount of two hundred dollars
($200.00).
3. If you return the attached payment receipt with your check or money order to the address listed
on the payment receipt within 30 days, AAFES will provide you with a release from further civil
liability. If payment is not received within 30 days, AAFES may pursue action in civil court to
recover the damages and is entitled to recover attorney’s fees and court costs in the trial and
appellate courts. Payment of the Demand for Payment does not release you from criminal
prosecution or administrative action.
