3.1. CSAF-level Awards. The Chief of Staff, United States Air Force has approved two awards to pro-
mote maintenance excellence at the MAJCOM and Program Office level. These awards are based on per-
formance over the past year and reward the organization (MAJCOM/Program Office) that demonstrates
the most improvement from the previous year. At the end of each FY, AF/A4MY will perform the calcu-
lations on “rates” (see 3.1.1.3. and 3.1.2.3.) for both awards to select the winners.
     3.1.1. The Gen Wilbur L. Creech Maintenance Excellence Award.
        3.1.1.1. Background. This award recognizes the MAJCOM demonstrating the most improved
        performance in the category of aircraft maintenance and logistics readiness for each fiscal year.
        3.1.1.2. Eligibility. All MAJCOMs are eligible for this award. There is no unit-generated pack-
        age required. However, the winning MAJCOM will post an electronic copy of a citation to the AF/
        A4M CoP within 15 days of notification. This citation will be read at the presentation ceremony.
        3.1.1.3. Criteria. The winner is determined by calculating the improvement for a predetermined
        set of metrics (at the MAJCOM aggregate level) and multiplying each metric by a corresponding
        weighted value. The metrics are aircraft availability rate as follows: Mission Capable (MC) Rate,
        Total Not Mission Capable Maintenance (TNMCM) Rate, Total Not Mission Capable for Supply
        (TNMCS) Rate, Cannibalization (CANN) Rate, and Hangar Queen Rate. The weighting factor
        will be assigned to emphasize certain aspects of the award (i.e. used to influence key areas and
        focus attention on the most important metrics).
        3.1.1.4. Winner Notification/Presentation. AF/A4/7 approves the winner and will notify MAJ-
        COMs by message. CSAF presents the award to the winner at a ceremony in the Pentagon. Win-
        ning MAJCOM name is added to the permanent display in the Pentagon.

        3.1.2.1. Background. This award recognizes the AFMC aircraft Program Offices (or equivalent)
        that, while supporting the fleet, demonstrated the most improved performance in the category of
        sustainment for each fiscal year.
        3.1.2.2. Eligibility. All AFMC aircraft Program Offices (or equivalent) are eligible for this
        award. There is no unit-generated package required. AFMC will post an electronic copy of a cita-
        tion to the AF/A4M CoP within 15 days of notification. This citation will be read at the presenta-
        tion ceremony.
        3.1.2.3. Criteria. The winner is determined by calculating the improvement for a predetermined
        set of metrics (at the Mission Design Series (MDS) aggregate level) and multiplying each metric
        by a corresponding weighted value. The metrics are Aircraft Availability Rate, MC Rate,
        TNMCM Rate, TNMCS Rate, CANN Rate, and Hangar Queen Rate. The weighting factor will be
        assigned to emphasize certain aspects of the award (i.e. used to influence key areas and focus
        attention on the most important metrics).
        3.1.2.4. Winner Notification/Presentation. AF/A4/7 approves the winner and will notify
        AFMC by message. CSAF presents the award to the winner at a ceremony in the Pentagon. Win-
