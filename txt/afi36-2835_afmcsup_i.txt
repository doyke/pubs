This Air Force Instruction (AFI) implements Air Force Policy Directive 36-28, Awards and Decorations,
establishing annual award programs for outstanding performance in acquisition transformation, acquisi-
tion leadership, contracting, value engineering, and science and engineering. It explains eligibility, nomi-
nation procedures and award selection criteria. Major commands (MAJCOM), field operating agencies
(FOA), direct reporting units (DRU), the Air Force Secretariat and Headquarters US Air Force ensure all
organizations have the opportunity to nominate eligible units and individuals for awards as described in
this instruction, forward nominees for competition at Air Force level, and arrange local recognition.
Awards are presented annually for achievements during the previous year. Acquisition transformation,
acquisition leadership, value engineering, and science and technology awards are based on calendar year;
contracting on a fiscal year basis. Selection panels may withhold an award due to lack of competition or
when nominees’ achievements are not considered deserving of Air Force recognition. Recipients of indi-
vidual or team Air Force awards described in this instruction are authorized to wear the Air Force Recog-
nition Ribbon (military) or the Air Force Recognition Lapel Pin (civilian). Ensure that all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFPD 371-,
Information Management and AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records and disposed of in accordance
with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil.

                                       CONTRACTING AWARDS

3.1. Nomination Responsibilities and Procedures. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs may submit nomina-
tions as identified in Table 3.1. The J-4 of Unified and Joint Commands may nominate Air Force military
members or civilians according to the categories in Table 3.1.
3.1. (AFMC) Nominations Responsibilities and Procedures. AFMC Outstanding Contracting Unit/
Team, Outstanding Officer in Contracting, and Outstanding Civilian in Contracting awards will be given
in each of the following categories: Operational/Specialized, Science & Technology (S&T), Systems, and
Logistics. Each AFMC center, including the Air Force Research Laboratory, may submit a nominee in
each category, as appropriate. Research and development actions that normally precede and are directly
related to systems development fall under the Systems, not the S&T, category. AFMC will maintain a list-
ing of units eligible to compete in the “specialized” category. Nominations from Operational Contracting
Squadrons must be submitted through the Senior Center Contracting Official after coordination by the
Mission Support Group Commander or the Wing Commander. Send all nomination packages by transmit-
tal letter to arrive at HQ AFMC/PKX by the deadline established in the AFMC/PK request for nomina-
tions letter. The Center Director/Deputy Director of Contracting should sign the transmittal letter. HQ
AFMC/PK will forward the nominations for Air Force awards to SAF/AQC after major command evalu-
ation and endorsement. Any changes will be coordinated with the nominating organization. Organizations
are responsible for advising HQ AFMC/PKX of any name or rank changes for AFMC award winners and
Air Force nominees.

3.2. Definition of Unit. Unit refers to buying offices, flights, squadrons, or program offices. It includes
activities issuing operational, systems, logistics, science & technology, specialized, or classified con-
tracts. Non-contracting activities that support the contracting community, such as training centers, may
compete for the Outstanding Unit award. Teams of individuals from these activities may be nominated.
3.2. (AFMC) Definition of Unit.
     3.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Operational/Specialized. This category applies to base level operational
     contracting squadrons/divisions and specialized buying offices whose primary mission is to provide
     unique support in other than logistics, systems, or science and technology. An operational unit pro-
     vides contractual support for base operations support or mission operations support. A specialized
     unit, typically, has a mission of command-wide or Air Force-wide support as opposed to supporting
     only one base, or has a mission to acquire non-standard supplies and services or special studies and
     analyses. A specialized unit may include a non-buying activity that supports the contracting commu-
     nity, such as training centers. A specialized unit may or may not be a contracting squadron.
     3.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Science & Technology (S&T ). A unit whose primary mission is issuing and
     administering science & technology (6.1 basic research, 6.2 exploratory research, and 6.3A advanced
     research) contracts in direct support of one of the technical directorates in Air Force Research Labora-
     tory.
     3.2.3. (Added-AFMC) Systems. This category applies to buying offices with a primary mission to
     develop and procure new systems or new modifications to systems at Product Centers. It does not
     apply to the Product Center itself as a unit.

   3.2.4. (Added-AFMC) Logistics. This category applies to buying offices with a primary mission to
   provide sustainment support (repair, spares replenishment, modification, and engineering services)
   contracting at Logistics Centers. It does not apply to the Logistic Center itself as a unit.
   3.2.5. (Added-AFMC) Classified. This category applies to a buying office with a primary mission to
   provide contracting support to a classified organization/or program.

3.3. Nomination Procedures.
   3.3.1. Nomination package includes the front side only of one AF Form 1206, “Nomination for
   Award,” and supplemental information page (see Figure 3.1. and Figure 3.2.). Accompanying cita-
   tion for each nomination may be submitted on an additional page. If a typewritten AF Form 1206 is
   submitted, minimum acceptable font size is 12 point. Forward all nominations, except those contain-
   ing classified information, to SAF/AQCX, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1060 by
   20 January. Nominations with classified information may be written in a classified security classifica-
   tion level and faxed via secure channels, by 20 January, to SAF/AQL, Attn: Special Programs Con-
   tracting Officer.
   3.3.2. In addition to forwarding the nomination packages in accordance with 3.3.1., an email contain-
   ing the proposed citations for all nominations should be sent to SAF/AQCX by 20 January. All cita-
   tions should be in a Microsoft Word file attached to the email.
   3.3.3. Inclusion of nominee’s social security number on the AF Form 1206 is optional.
   3.3.4. Except under extraordinary circumstances, do not nominate an individual for the same award
   won within the previous 5 years.

3.4. Evaluation Criteria and Panel. Criteria for each award are identified in Table 3.2. Nominees must
clearly demonstrate sustained and superior performance. The evaluation panel consists of at least three
senior officials from within the office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary (Contracting) and will be chaired
by the Deputy Assistant Secretary (Contracting). All awards are approved by SAF/AQC.
3.4. (AFMC) Evaluation Criteria and Panel. The HQ AFMC selection panel will select winners for
AFMC individual and unit awards and nominees for Air Force awards based on the criteria contained in
the basic Air Force Instruction. Selections and nominations will not be final, however, until approved by
HQ AFMC/PK. Unless HQ AFMC/PK specifies otherwise, the HQ AFMC selection committee will con-
sist of a Chairperson (Deputy Director), division chiefs, the command contracting superintendent, and a
recorder.
   3.4.1. Nomination packages should address specific results, process improvements, contribution to
   competition and commercial practices, and acquisition reform implementation, as applicable, in addi-
   tion to specific duty accomplishments that supported the mission.

3.5. Award Presentation. The awards are normally presented in conjunction with the spring Worldwide
Contracting Conference arranged by SAF/AQC.

3.6. Transportation. The award winners’ organizations will provide funding for transportation and
accommodations when the awards are presented

NOTES:
6. (Added) AFMC/PK will break out this award into four categories: operational/specialized, systems,
S&T, and logistics. AFMC/PK will select unit, team or individuals to be forwarded for competition at the
AF level. NOTE: For teams of ten people or less, there will be a team award memento and each team
member will receive a small individual memento. Teams comprised of more than ten people will receive

Example: (for Secretary of the Air Force Professionalism in Contracting Award) As an instructor and
author of contracting articles published in professional magazines and journals, Ms. Smith has fostered
the growth and development of others in our field. She is an accomplished contract negotiator with
multi-service contracting experience. She achieved superior results on complex programs supporting
vital Air Force programs.


Example: (for Other Individual Awards) Mr. Jones developed innovative ideas and contracting concepts,
resolving long-standing problems affecting mission essential service contracts. He developed an
innovative contract for altitude chamber testing that will save the government $52,000 and 180 days of
pilot downtime annually. In support of Operation DESERT STORM, he restructured contracts for
critical services affected by government personnel deployments. The end result was continued excellent
support of the Air Force mission.
