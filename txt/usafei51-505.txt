This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 51-5, Military Legal Affairs. It
sets out the procedures to be followed when a service vehicle is involved in a traffic accident in
the United Kingdom (UK). The purpose is to ensure timely and sufficient reporting of accidents
to the Ministry of Defence (MOD), the US sending state claims office, and unit claims offices.
Only through prompt and accurate reporting of accidents, which may give rise to claims, can the
interests of the United States (US), the UK, the service driver, and third party claimants be
protected. This instruction is applicable to all elements of the US Force, permanently stationed
or on temporary duty (TDY) in the UK. It includes Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and
Air National Guard of the United States (ANGUS). This instruction requires collecting and
maintaining information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 authorized by 5 USC 552 (a).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
revision incorporates the title change of 16 AFI 51-505 to USAFEI 51-505 and the name change
of 16 AF, Det 3 to Headquarters, United States Air Forces in Europe, Detachment 1, which is
referred to throughout this document as United States Air Forces in Europe-United States Air
Forces Africa/United Kingdom (USAFE-AFAFRICA/UK). It also incorporates the new name of
the MOD Common Law Claims and Policy Division, Directorate of Judicial Engagement Policy
from the MOD Directorate of Safety and Claims. This revision directs the utilization of Standard
Form 91 (SF 91), Motor Vehicle Accident Report, in place of 16 AF, Det 3 Form 349, US Armed
Forces Motor Vehicle Accident Report.
1. Definitions.
     1.1. Traffic Accident. A service vehicle has been involved in a traffic accident for purposes
     of this instruction if:
        1.1.1. The service vehicle, whether moving or stationary, is involved in a collision with
        another object causing injury to a person or animal, or damage to any vehicle (including
        the service vehicle), property, goods, or other object.
        1.1.2. The service vehicle, by its presence but without physical involvement, contributed
        to, or allegedly contributed to, the cause of the accident in which damage or injury
        occurred. This applies whether or not the incident occurred on service property. The
        term "traffic accident" is used interchangeably with the term "motor vehicle accident."
     1.2. Service Vehicle. Any vehicle owned and maintained or utilized (including hired and
     MOD vehicles) by a US force, a non-appropriated fund activity, Army and Air Force
     Exchange Service (AAFES), or any Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) activity or the
     MOD, when the driver was acting on behalf of the US Government or the MOD.
     1.3. Service Driver. Any person who, whether with or without authority, was driving,
     controlling, or had custodial responsibility for, the vehicle at the time of the traffic accident,
     or alleged traffic accident. This includes USAF service personnel, members of the civilian
     component, MOD employees and local civilians driving US owned vehicles acting on behalf
     of the US or the MOD.
     1.4. Third Party. For the purposes of this instruction, any person or legal entity sustaining
     or purportedly sustaining property damage or injury. US service personnel and members of
     the civilian component are specifically excluded from this definition.
     1.5. Reporting Officer. The vehicle control officer (VCO) of vehicle operations to which
     the vehicle was assigned at the time of the accident, or if none, the officer in charge of the
     activity to which the vehicle was assigned, or the officer in charge of the activity to which the
     operator was assigned if the vehicle is leased or borrowed. This definition includes MWR
USAFEI51-505 6 JUNE 2014                                                                         3


   activities, non-appropriated fund activities, and the AAFES activities that are responsible for
   vehicles.
2. Obligation to Report Traffic Accidents. Every traffic accident in which a service vehicle is
involved is to be reported to the appropriate offices (set forth below) within 72 hours of its
occurrence. The traffic accident report will consist of the following:
   2.1. SF 91, Motor Vehicle Accident Report, for accidents that must be reported to the UK
   MOD.
   2.2. Those documents are required to be completed in accordance with AFI 24-301, Vehicle
   Operations, Chapter 8.
   2.3. Signed statement of the service driver.
   2.4. Signed statement of service witnesses, including all passengers in the service vehicle
   and other personnel who witnessed the accident.
   2.5. Photographs if available, preferably in color.
   2.6. AF Form 1823, Vehicle and Equipment Work Order, or if a civilian repair facility is
   utilized, an itemized invoice or estimate listing the repairs to the service vehicle. Once an AF
   Form 20, Repair Cost and Repairable Value Statement, has been completed (including
   overhead costs), forward copies in accordance with paragraphs 3.3.2 or 3.3.3, as appropriate.
   If the vehicle is damaged beyond economic repair, a statement of intended disposition will be
   attached. Do not salvage any service vehicle prior to obtaining permission from the MOD.
   2.7. A "Certificate of Willingness to Act as Guardian ad Litem and Retainer of 'Guardian ad
   Litem'" (Attachment 2) will be obtained if the service driver was less than eighteen years old
   and was acting on official duty.
   2.8. In cases where the vehicle accident occurred during a deviation from an authorized
   route, a statement by the reporting officer certifying that the accident occurred during a
   deviation from an authorized route must be obtained. The statement should include the
   reason and circumstances for the deviation and the approximate difference in distance
   between the actual route and the authorized route. Any questions regarding a deviation from
   an authorized route should be presented to the nearest claims officer or judge advocate.
   2.9. This instruction does not preclude other reporting requirements. Military personnel
   must report vehicle accidents to the nearest Security Forces, Military Police, or Navy
   equivalent.
3. Action to be taken when a Service Vehicle is in an Accident. The MOD Common Law
Claims & Policy Division (CLC&P) processes all claims that arise from road traffic accidents in
the United Kingdom involving US Armed Forces' vehicles and MOD vehicles when the service
driver is performing US Armed Forces' business. All such accidents are reported on the SF 91.
Claims are dealt with by the MOD in accordance with The NATO Status of Forces Agreement.
In addition, the requirements of AFI 24-301, Chapter 8, must be fulfilled.
   3.1. Unit of Service Driver will ensure: (T-1)

       report the accident at a police station or to a constable as soon as reasonably practicable
       and, in any case, within seventy-two hours of the accident. Upon their return to base, the
       driver must also notify the military police. Report all accidents occurring on military
       installations to the military police as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 72
       hours after the accident.
       3.1.3. If the driver was on official business at the time of the accident, the driver will
       complete an SF 91, which must be prepared with original signatures. Carbon signatures
       are not acceptable. The SF 91 may be completed after the service driver returns to the
       base, but should be completed in sufficient time to insure compliance with the time
       standard provided in paragraph 3.1.2 Particular attention should be paid to the following:
           3.1.3.1. Section II, Other Vehicle Data. Details of the owner's and driver's name (if
           different from that of the owner), address, and vehicle details must be obtained. The
           third party's insurance details should be obtained and noted if possible.
       3.1.4. Report to the responsible reporting officer with the completed SF 91 and make a
       written statement. The written statement must be prepared with an original signature.
    3.2. Passengers and other witnesses. All passengers in the service vehicle or other service
    connected personnel who may have witnessed the accident will report to the reporting officer
    and make a written statement. The statements will contain detailed information concerning

    prepared with original signatures.
    3.3. Unit Reporting Officer:
       3.3.1. The reporting officer is responsible for compliance with the provisions of this
       instruction. (T-1)
       3.3.2. The reporting officer will execute Section X, Details of Trip During Which
       Accident Occurred, of the SF 91, with an original signature. The reporting officer will
       mark the appropriate block in Block 82 to indicate whether or not the service driver was
       within the scope of duty. If the block indicating "Yes" is checked, the reporting officer
       should also mark either "Yes" or "No" to the question of Block 79, “Was There Any
       Deviation From Direct Route?” If the driver was within the scope of duty (Block 82,
       “Yes”) but deviated from the authorized route (Block 79, “Yes”), an explanation for the
       deviation from the authorized route must be provided in writing (see paragraph 2.8) and
       bear an original signature.

       3.3.3. When the SF 91 is prepared, the reporting officer will ensure inclusion of all
