1. Program Authority and Scope:
    1.1. 10 U.S.C. § 1561 establishes requirements for the processing of complaints alleging
    sexual harassment made by civilian employees of the military services who are under the
    supervision of a “commanding officer or officer in charge of a unit, vessel, facility, or area of
    the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps.” Section 1561 directs specific actions by
    commanding officers, sets time lines for the commencement and completion of
    investigations, and establishes reporting requirements. At this time, no Department of
    Defense or Air Force instructions exist for implementing this program. See Attachment 1 for
    relevant policy letters.
    1.2. In addition to other long-standing avenues of redress for sexual harassment—to include
    EO complaints, negotiated grievance procedures, and mixed case MSPB appeals—certain
    civilian employees can also request a commander-directed investigation (CDI). The test for
    determining whether a civilian employee is covered by 10 U.S.C. § 1561 may be slightly
    different than the test for the Equal Opportunity (EO) complaints. Contact the Legal Office
    for further guidance.
2. 35 FW/EO Responsibilities:
    2.1. 35 FW/EO is appointed the Point of Contact to receive complaints under this
    instruction.
    2.2. 35 FW/EO will develop a publicity campaign to educate the base population regarding
    these prescribed procedures.
    2.3. EO, during the initial EO counseling process, will consult 35 FW/JA to determine
    whether a CDI is appropriate and will ascertain the complainant’s desire to proceed with a
    CDI.
    2.4. If the complaint is covered by this policy and EO has ascertained that the complainant
    desires to proceed with a CDI, EO will forward a written description of the facts of the case
    to 35 FW/CC through 35 FW/JA within 48 hours. See Attachment 2 for the format for EO’s
35FWI51-101 17 SEPTEMBER 2009                                                                   3


   memorandum. EO will continue to process the complaint under standards published by
   EEOC regulations if appropriate.
   2.5. If processing under this instruction is not authorized, EO will process the complaint
   under standards published by EEOC regulations if appropriate.
3. 35 FW/JA Responsibilities:
   3.1. 35 FW/JA will help 35 FW/EO determine whether a complaint is covered by this policy.
   3.2. 35 FW/JA will assist the Investigating Officer (IO) during the investigation.
4. 35 FW/CC Responsibilities:
   4.1. 35 FW/CC will, within 72 hours of receipt of the written description from EO:
      4.1.1. Provide 5 AF/CC with a copy of the written description from EO.
      4.1.2. Direct a CDI into the truth of the allegation(s). The sample format for appointing
      an Investigating Officer (IO) is found at Attachment 3.
      4.1.3. Advise the complainant of the commencement of the investigation. The sample
      format for the notification letter to the complainant is found at Attachment 4.
   4.2. 35 FW/CC will, 14 calendar days after commencement of the investigation, ensure the
   IO’s report is complete; if it is not, provide an interim report to 5 AF/CC on the 14th day and
   each subsequent 14 calendar days thereafter until the investigation is complete.
   4.3. Within three calendar days of receiving the IO’s report, make a determination whether
   the allegation(s) is(are) substantiated. Within six calendar days, notify the complainant in
   writing of the IO’s findings and the determination as to whether the allegation(s) was(were)
   substantiated. Additionally, to the extent possible, in keeping with applicable privacy and
   security considerations, also advise the complainant about any corrective action taken.
   4.4. Submit a final report to 5 AF/CC of the results of the investigation, including any action
   taken as a result of the investigation.
5. Time Standards:
   5.1. The time standards outlined above are goals, not enforceable metrics. Failure to meet
   any of the time standards does not create any rights for the complainant.
6. Prescribed and Adopted Forms.
   6.1. Prescribed Forms: No forms prescribed.
   6.2. Adopted Forms: AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.

MEMORANDUM FOR INVESTIGATING OFFICER

FROM: 35 FW/CC

SUBJECT: Appointment as Investigating Officer, Allegation(s) of Sexual Harassment

1. You are hereby appointed as the investigating officer detailed to investigate the sexual
harassment allegation(s) of (complainant). Your investigation will include an examination into
all salient aspects of this matter. In conducting your investigation, you should follow the
guidance contained in the IG CDI Guide, dated 7 July 2006, which is available electronically at
http://www.ig.hq.af.mil/igq/Downloads/IGQDownloads.htm.

2. All persons subject to the jurisdiction of my command, and all civilian employees of the Air
Force and its instrumentalities who you contact, are hereby ordered to cooperate with you, to
answer your questions, and to provide other information that you request, unless they properly
claim the right against self-incrimination under Article 31, Uniform Code of Military Justice, or
the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

3. You are authorized to conduct interviews and take oral and written statements. You are also
authorized to examine records. In this regard, the appropriate records custodian will make all
records, files, and other relevant documentation available to you. This letter is authorization for
the custodian to release any unclassified and non-privileged documents that you request.

4. Here are your procedural instructions:

   a.   You will read and ensure that you understand the definition of sexual harassment found at
        10 U.S.C. § 1561. You will also read over the detailed description of the allegations
        prepared by 35 FW/EO.

   b.   Prior to initiating your investigation, consult the 35 FW/JA for guidance.

   c.   With my advance approval, go to any place necessary for the proper execution of this
        duty.

   d.   This investigation is directed under the authority of 10 U.S.C. § 1561.

   e.   Your investigation should be completed in 14 calendar days from the date of this
        appointment letter. If your investigation is not completed within 14 calendar days from

        updated report every 14 calendar days thereafter until your investigation is complete.
12                                                           35FWI51-101 17 SEPTEMBER 2009


     f.   Report facts, opinions, and your recommendations to me in writing by [date], unless I grant
          an extension. Follow the report format described in the IG CDI Guide.

     g.   As a rule, have your witnesses make written statements after you have interviewed them.
          Ensure they address their statements to the relevant matters of this inquiry. Avoid
          making summarized statements. Make a summarized statement (in addition to taking a
          witness' written statement) only when the written statement contains excessive matter that
          is irrelevant or immaterial to the investigation. 35 FW/JA will tell you which, if any,
          written statements need to be summarized.

     h.   Consult with 35 FW/JA as needed throughout your investigation and submit your report
