                                             Chapter 1

                             THE AIR FORCE SERE PROGRAM

1.1. General Issues. This instruction:
     1.1.1. Applies to all MAJCOMs and ANG.
     1.1.2. Defines minimum Code of Conduct Training (CoCT) and Code of Conduct
     Continuation Training (CoCCT) requirements for United States Air Force (USAF) personnel.
     1.1.3. Lists overall Personnel Recovery (PR) operational support responsibilities and defines
     roles and duties of Air Force SERE Specialists (1T000/1T0X1) in support of PR.
     1.1.4. Defines roles and responsibilities for SERE Specialist career field management.
     1.1.5. Defines procedures for evaluating and inspecting key aspects of the Air Force SERE
     Program.
1.2. Program Explanation:
     1.2.1. This instruction describes the Air Force SERE Program as a function within DoD PR.
     The Air Force SERE program encompasses CoCT, CoCCT, and PR operational support
     required to enable military, civilian, contractor, and other designated personnel to return to
     friendly control after isolation due to enemy actions, aircraft emergency, or other unforeseen
     events. The sole purpose of the AF SERE Program is to support PR operations through
     education, training, and operational support activities. Specifically, the Universal Joint Task
     List (UJTL), Joint Mission Essential Task List (JMTEL), and applicable Air Force tasks for
     conducting personnel recovery operations drive SERE Program requirements. Doctrinally,
     the PR continuum is comprised of education and training, mission planning, execution,
     tracking, debriefing, repatriating, and applying applicable lessons learned. The SERE
     Program begins and closes the PR continuum beginning with initial SERE training and
     culminating with repatriation.
     1.2.2. CoCT Goals and Objectives.
        1.2.2.1. The goal of CoCT is to prepare personnel to return with honor, regardless of the
        circumstances of isolation.
        1.2.2.2. The objective of CoCT is to provide a clear and direct SERE/PR linkage from
        initial through refresher and continuation training, exercises, and combat operations to
        ensure efficient training and effective support occur throughout the member's career.
        1.2.2.3. The Code of Conduct (CoC) is the foundation underpinning the warfighter’s
        PR/SERE preparation and training. AF CoCT programs must prepare USAF personnel
        for all forms of modern contingencies, from wartime to Operations Other Than War
        (OOTW).
        1.2.2.4. Any event that places any US forces member in a situation where he or she is
        isolated and no longer in friendly control triggers the need for PR. These triggering
        events can occur through hostile enemy actions during OOTW, terrorist actions, or as a
        result of natural or manmade conditions. The Air Force SERE Program is an integral part
        of an organized PR effort among several related functions.
AFI16-1301_AFMCSUP_I 14 JULY 2010                                                               5


      1.2.2.5. AF SERE program must provide the necessary PR information prior to and
      during contingency operations to USAF personnel at risk of capture. Isolated personnel
      increase their chance of an expedient recovery and reduce risk to the recovery force when
      they are trained to perform PR Joint tactics, techniques, and procedures (JTTPs).

2.3. Code of Conduct Continuation Training (CoCCT) Program Management:
   2.3.1. CoCCT Intent:
      2.3.1.1. CoCCT is a combination of refresher CoCT and additional theater specific
      Contingency SERE Indoctrination (CSI) training. Frequency and depth of training are
      based on missions conducted (and associated perceived threats) of personnel requiring
      training. MAJCOMs and the ANG will tailor curriculum and training to meet minimum
      requirements levied by this publication and IAW combatant command guidance.
      2.3.1.2. CoCCT is designed to ensure personnel maintain critical SERE skills gained at
      formal SERE training courses and to tailor SERE skills for specific aircraft, missions, and
      deployed locations.
      2.3.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Equipment used during all CoCCT events will mirror
      operational equipment carried aboard assigned MDS to greatest extent possible. See
      paragraph 1.4.7.2.
      2.3.1.4. (Added-AFMC) An operating instruction (OI) will be developed detailing how
      the CoCCT program will be conducted. The OI will be coordinated with any agency (e.g.
      Weapons/Tactics, Intelligence, AFE) that assists SERE personnel in providing training to
      crews. The OI will be approved by the Unit Commander or equivalent.
      2.3.1.5. (Added-AFMC) Maintain current files of directives, procedures, T.O.s, and
      manuals pertaining to issue, inspections, maintenance, and use of AFE or systems
      possessed, and ensure compliance with instructions contained therein.
      2.3.1.6. (Added-AFMC) Perform an annual in-depth, SERE program assessment IAW
      MAJCOM/wing self-assessment program. A record of assessment reports, discrepancies,
      and corrected actions will be maintained for 2 years. Maintain records IAW Air Force
      Manual 33-363.
      2.3.1.7. (Added-AFMC) Monitor status of deficiencies identified during SAVs, UCIs,
      ORIs, and unit self-assessments until corrective actions have been completed. Corrective
      actions will be documented as prescribed by governing instructions or as required to
      reflect current status and actions taken.
   2.3.2. CoCCT Instructors:
      2.3.2.1. IAW DoDI 1300.21, the Air Force is "responsible for identifying and qualifying
      CoC and SERE training specialists."

     2.3.2.2. 1T0X1, SERE Specialists are the only Air Force specialty specifically recruited,
     trained, and employed to conduct SERE operations support, CoCT, and CoCCT for the
     duration of their career.
     2.3.2.3. Where SERE specialists aren't assigned, available, or additional manpower is
     required, SERE MFMs in coordination with affected MFMs may authorize other
     designated personnel to support this requirement. All CoCCT instructors will be
     qualified and certified IAW SERE training plans. The SERE MFM will coordinate
     MAJCOM specific training requirements for unit level CoCCT instructors with the
     respective MFM(s) for inclusion into their Master JQS/CFETP.
  2.3.3. Exceptions to Continuation/Refresher Training Events.
     2.3.3.1. If deploying to a location where a CoCCT training capability does not exist,
     training must be accomplished prior to departure.
     2.3.3.2. If deployed to a location where a training capability doesn't exist and the
     individual becomes due CoCCT, training must be accomplished within 60 days of return
     to home station.
     2.3.3.3. Personnel arriving from permanent change of station (PCS) or temporary duty
     (TDY) during a period when combat survival or water survival training is not available
     (i.e., winter months, pool unavailable) are automatically granted a waiver to this
     requirement until 60 days following the first available training date. However,
     individuals will attend the academic portions of training at the earliest opportunity.

                    SERE PROGRAM PR OPERATIONAL SUPPORT

3.1. General Concepts of PR Operational Support:
   3.1.1. The AF SERE Program supports PR requirements reflected in Chairman of the Joint
   Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3270.01, Personnel Recovery Within the Department of
   Defense (classified), DoD Directive 2310.2, Personnel Recovery, Joint Publication (JP) 3-
   50.3, Joint Doctrine for Evasion and Recovery (E&R), and JP 3-50.21, Joint Tactics,
   Techniques, and Procedures (JTTP) for CSAR. NOTE: PR operational support was
   formerly known as Evasion and Recovery (E&R) or Escape and Evasion (E&E) and includes
   duties related to conventional and non-conventional assisted recovery (NAR) IAW DoDI
   2310.6, Non-Conventional Assisted Recovery in the Department of Defense.3.1.1.1. PR
   operational support programs consist of: all actions taken prior to mission execution to equip
   and facilitate planning for warfighters’ SERE and PR efforts in the event of isolation, actions
   taken after isolation to plan and execute PR, and actions taken after recovery to ensure
   lessons learned are documented and incorporated into TTP.
      3.1.1.1. Unit-level operational support programs are executed by SERE, Intelligence and
      Aircrew Life Support functions. Specifically, SERE specialists employed in PR
      operational support programs will:
          3.1.1.1.1. Provide SME, policy guidance, and oversight of Evasion Plans of Action
          (EPA), Isolated Personnel Reports (ISOPREP), Evasion Charts, Blood Chits, and PR
          Kits to ensure compliance with directives. Units will delineate responsibilities of
          Intelligence and SERE Specialists.
          3.1.1.1.2. Identify PR unique intelligence requirements.
          3.1.1.1.3. Provide SERE subject matter expertise to the Joint Search and Rescue
          Center (JSRC), Rescue Coordination Center (RCC), or equivalent organization to
          develop SERE and PR JTTP.
          3.1.1.1.4. Provide subject matter expertise for Aircrew Life Support Specialists to
          identify and incorporate appropriate aircrew life support and survival equipment
          required for successful PR.
          3.1.1.1.5. As an integral part of PR repatriation plans, SERE SMEs will ensure
          repatriation debriefings are applied at the tactical level and included in theater
          briefings during contingency operations. Additionally, SERE SMEs will ensure
          repatriation after action/lessons learned are included in entry level CoCT and CoCCT.
3.2. Responsibilities for PR Operational Support.
   3.2.1. HQ USAF/A3OS:
      3.2.1.1. Acts as OPR for all PR activities within the Air Force.
      3.2.1.2. Provides standardized guidance to MAJCOMs on issues pertaining to PR
      operational support activities.
AFI16-1301_AFMCSUP_I 14 JULY 2010                                                           27


   3.2.2. HQ USAF/XOII: Provides standardized guidance to MAJCOMs on issues pertaining
   to PR intelligence support activities.
   3.2.3. MAJCOMs and ANG will:
      3.2.3.1. Ensure all organizations within their respective commands integrate standardized
      PR operational support programs in coordination with combatant command requirements.
      3.2.3.2. Utilize the SERE MFM to:
          3.2.3.2.1. Manage their PR operational support program.
          3.2.3.2.2. Coordinate SERE SMEs to support inspections of unit level PR operational
          support programs for compliance (where SERE SMEs are not already integrated into

   to follow the crews as they prepare for and plan combat support missions so they can tailor
   their training to be current with the crews needs.
4.4. Physical Fitness Test:
   4.4.1. Successful execution of the SERE specialist missions requires a high degree of
   physical fitness beginning with entry level training (S-V81-A) and continuing throughout a
   member’s career. The unique SERE mission requires optimum individual performance in
   areas of adverse terrain, every environmental condition, and airborne operations. These
   conditions require mental and physical capabilities be maintained at a high level.
   Commanders will ensure assigned SERE specialists complete at least 5 hours of fitness
   training weekly. Commanders will utilize the following standards to assess and maintain
   overall fitness levels:
   4.4.2. SERE specialists will be assessed annually. The fitness test consists of push-ups, sit-
   ups, pull-ups and 2-mile run. Point values for the events are shown in Table 4.1, Physical
   Fitness Evaluation Criteria. A minimum of 210 points is necessary for satisfactory
   completion. Grading criteria are as follows: 520-395 points = Outstanding, 390-280
   points=Excellent, 275-210 points=Satisfactory. Additionally, an alternate 6-mile ruck march
   or 800-meter swim may be used in lieu of the 2-mile run. Points associated with the 6-mile
   ruck march and 800-meter swim are outlined within the related paragraph. Calisthenics
   events will be tested, one immediately after the other, with approximately a 2-minute time
   rest between events. Upon completion of all calisthenics events, a rest of approximately 10
   minutes is given prior to starting the 2–mile run, 6-mile ruck march or 800-meter swim.

     4.4.2.1. Pull–ups (time limit: 2 minutes). This exercise is executed on a pull–up bar.
     The individual grasps the bar with the palms toward the face about shoulder width apart.
     This is a two-count exercise. The exercise begins in the ―dead hang‖ position. Count one,
     pull the body directly upward until the chin is over the bar. Count two, lower the body
     until the body is again in the ―dead hang‖ position. Individuals will not swing
     excessively or bicycle feet as the chin is pulled over the bar. Repeat as many times as
     possible. This exercise is designed to measure strength and endurance in the back and
     biceps muscles.
     4.4.2.2. Sit–ups (time limit: 4 minutes). Start with the back flat on the ground, fingers
     interlocked behind the head, head off the ground and knees bent at approximately a 90-
     degree angle. Another individual will hold the feet during the exercise. This is a two-
     count exercise. Count one, sit up until the back is vertical to the ground. Count two,
     return to the starting position. There is no authorized rest position. If an individual raises
     buttocks from ground or their fingers are not interlocked behind head during a repetition,
     the repetition is not counted. This exercise is designed to measure strength and endurance
     in abdominal and hip flexor muscle groups.
     4.4.2.3. Push-ups (time limit: 2 minutes). This exercise starts from the front leaning rest
     position. The body must be maintained straight from head to heels with knees together.
     This is a two-count exercise. Count one, flex the elbows, lowering the body until the
     elbows form a 90-degree angle. Count two, raise the body until the elbows are straight
     and locked. Repeat this exercise as many times as possible. Event is stopped if an
     individual touches a knee to the ground. The only authorized rest position is the starting
     position. This exercise is designed to measure the strength and endurance of the chest
     and triceps muscles.
     4.4.2.4. Two-Mile Run. This is performed with running shoes and appropriate athletic
     attire. This event will be performed on flat, level, hard-surfaced terrain. This exercise is
     designed to measure aerobic endurance.
  4.4.3. Substandard Performance. Due to the potential risk to the SERE specialist and
  those they work with, minimum fitness standard must be met in order to control factors
  associated with ORM. SERE specialists who fail to achieve the minimum standard on the
  SERE physical fitness test (SPFT) will satisfactorily complete the entire evaluation within 60
  calendar days of the failure. Those who fail the rstest should not be considered for
  worldwide deployment, field operations under adverse conditions, or airborne duty. A
  review board will be convened after the second failure.
  4.4.4. Review Board.
     4.4.4.1. The review board will consist of the unit operations officer, SERE MFM, and
     one senior enlisted SERE specialist designated by the SERE MFM.
     4.4.4.2. The board will evaluate and analyze all factors bearing on a situation and
     provide an impartial judgment.
     4.4.4.3. The review board will determine the circumstances and adequacy of training and
     submit recommendations to the commander for further action. Recommendations may
     include additional supervised training, counseling, or other administrative actions. Board
     findings will be maintained on file for 18 months.

   4.4.5. Temporary Profiles. A member with a temporary profile must take the regular four-
   event fitness test after the profile has expired. (Members with temporary profiles of more
   than 3 months may take an alternate test as determined by the commander with input from
   health-care personnel.) Once the profile is lifted, the SERE specialist must be given twice
   the time of the profile (but not more than 90 days) to train for the fitness test. For example, if
   the profile period was 7 days, the SERE specialist has 14 days to train for the SPFT after the
   profile period ends. If a normally scheduled SPFT occurs during the profile period, the
   SERE specialist should be given a mandatory make-up date.
   4.4.6. Permanent Profiles. Members who have been given a permanent profile by Air
   Force health professionals will be exempt from the SPFT. In the event that the member is
   returned to duty with no profile, he/she must take the SPFT within 90 days unless otherwise
   indicated in member's profile.
   4.4.7. Alternate Fitness Events:
   4.4.7.1. An alternate aerobic fitness test event is a 6-mile ruck march in lieu of the 2-mile
   run. The 6-mile ruck march will be conducted on flat level terrain with a 40-pound rucksack
   worn for the entire duration of the movement. Successful completion of the 6-mile ruck
   march with 40-pound ruck under the maximum time will be scored at 120 points for the
   aerobic portion of the fitness test.
      4.4.7.2. Additionally, members may elect to perform the 800-meter swim test. The 800-
      meter swim test assesses the aerobic fitness and muscular endurance of the individual.
      Members may elect to perform the 800-meter swim in lieu of the 2-mile run. The
      standards for the alternate swim event are listed in Table 4.2. Satisfactory completion of
      the alternate swim event will be scored at 120 points.

          JPRA can be integrated for a concurrent EAI inspection.
          5.2.1.3.2. HQ USAF/A3OS will notify JPRA of the pending inspection and
          coordinate JPRA's involvement.
          5.2.1.3.3. HQ USAF/A3OS will obtain the results of evaluations from JPRA.
      5.2.1.3.4. HQ AFMC will report all results of ORI Inspections of USAFSAM Level-B
      Course to HQ USAF/A3OS.
   5.2.2. SERE CoCCT Programs.
   5.2.3. SERE MFMs will compile an annual report of MAJCOM evaluations involving SERE
   CoCCT programs and forward to HQ USAF/A3OS.
   5.2.4. SERE Operational Support Programs. MAJCOM SERE functional managers will
   compile an annual report of MAJCOM evaluations of SERE Operational Support Programs
   and forward to HQ USAF/A3OS by 1 February.
5.3. SERE MFM Responsibilities:
   5.3.1. Coordinate SERE specialists augmentation for inspection teams to evaluate training
   and PR operational support programs.
   5.3.2. As a minimum, all CoCCT programs will be reviewed by a SERE specialist (1T071)
   at least biennially for safety processes and overall program effectiveness. This should be

   incorporated into the normal inspection programs when possible, although staff assistance
   visits are acceptable.
      5.3.2.1. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/A3V will conduct program management site visits
      (e.g., staff assistance visits) (SAV) to every AFMC unit with SERE personnel assigned.
      Funding for these SAV site visits will be provided by the visited unit and are required
      once every two years. If the CoCCT course of instruction is being evaluated, a qualified
      SERE specialist (1T071) will accompany HQ AFMC/A3V on the site visit.
   5.3.3. Ensure PR operational support missions are evaluated by qualified SERE SMEs
   during unit-level Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI)s or equivalent inspections.
5.4. PR Exercises.
   5.4.1. A robust PR exercise program is imperative for preparing the warfighter for
   prosecution of recovery across the spectrum of engagement. A major part of training for the
   PR process is the specific "actions on the objective" or the isolated personnel's role in the
   overall recovery effort. Currently, numerous MAJCOM-directed PR exercises are in place to
   allow recovery forces to execute critical METs of a successful recovery, as well as providing
   potential isolated personnel with an opportunity to practice evasion and recovery skills in a
   simulated combat environment (e.g., Red Flag, Air Mobility Warfare Center CADS, Cope
   Thunder, and ACC/AFSOC Combat Air Force (CAF) integration exercises). These exercises
   provide planners, aviation and ground recovery forces, as well as potential isolated personnel
   a forum for planning and executing full-spectrum PR TTP. Specifically, the SERE role
   within this process is to provide mission-critical feedback and after action review from the
   "survivor's" perspective.
   5.4.2. Specific SERE responsibilities.
      5.4.2.1. Assists in development of exercise plans (EXPLANs), SPINs, PR CONOPs, etc.
      5.4.2.2. Develops mission plans to include survivor participation, aircraft/team support,
      logistical support requirements, etc.
      5.4.2.3. Performs observer/controller (escort) duties to include data collection,
      performance feedback, safety, and emergency field medical treatment, as required.
      5.4.2.4. Coordinates and performs airborne operations, as required.
   5.4.3. Incorporating summary of PR exercise lessons learned and after action into both the
   formal and continuation processes is essential to successful PR. MAJCOMs conducting PR
   exercises will forward sanitized lessons learned and other PR-related after action items to HQ
   USAF/A3OS for review and distribution to the field. Use the "observation, analysis, and
   lessons learned" format for collecting and disseminating data.
      5.4.3.1. HQ AETC/DOFA will ensure applicable data is incorporated into the formal
      training process.
      5.4.3.2. MFMs for commands with Mission Ready (MR)/Combat Mission Ready (CMR)
      personnel and personnel assigned to combat-coded units will ensure appropriate lessons
      learned are distributed to subordinate units for inclusion in continuation/refresher training
      programs.

                      OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT (ORM)

A3.1. The SERE mission area often places personnel in remote environments and potentially
hazardous situations. Conditions often include austere operating locations, inclement weather,
rugged terrain, hazardous life forms, and fixed or rotary-wing operations. While operations
within the SERE mission area are typically objective driven, it is imperative all SERE missions
begin with a thorough and comprehensive risk assessment IAW the six step risk management
processes outlined in AFI 90-201 and AFPAM 90-202. While it is impractical to identify all
potential contingencies during an operation, proper planning will ensure overall individual safety
during high-risk training evolutions. Thorough risk management must assess the risk, weigh all
associated factors, and posture for as many contingencies as possible within a given operation
and ensure the appropriate level of command is involved in the decision making process to
accept residual risk. Regardless of the mission, thorough risk management must include
bioenvironmental, equipment, communication, location, and medical considerations.
   A3.1.1. Specifically, SERE operations and training activities should include the following:
       A3.1.1.1. Bioenvironmental
           A3.1.1.1.1. Weather
           A3.1.1.1.2. Terrain
           A3.1.1.1.3. Animal life
           A3.1.1.1.4. Plant life
           A3.1.1.1.5. Socio-political
   A3.1.2. Equipment
       A3.1.2.1. Vehicles
       A3.1.2.2. Personal protective
   A3.1.3. Communication
       A3.1.3.1. Mobile radios
       A3.1.3.2. Telephone
       A3.1.3.3. Air to ground visual signals
   A3.1.4. Assistance required date and time
       A3.1.4.1. Rear support element
   A3.1.5. Location
   A3.1.6. Medical
       A3.1.6.1. Minor
       A3.1.6.2. Major
       A3.1.6.3. Evacuation plans
AFI16-1301_AFMCSUP_I 14 JULY 2010                                                               47


       A3.1.6.4. Location/directions/contact procedures for local emergency care facilities.
A3.2. Specifically, the SERE Program approach to ORM should include consideration of three
main areas involved with each factor; "what exists, what is the impact, and what is the plan" for
dealing with each particular factor. Incorporating these areas into unit-level ORM programs will
ensure overall standardization, reduce instability within the planning processes, and ultimately
ensure all SERE operations are prosecuted in a safe manner regardless of the operating
environment.
A3.3. The following ORM checklists/matrixes may be applied to SERE operations and training
activities in order to assist in the safe prosecution of the SERE mission. However, it must be
understood that mere "numbers" should never be a substitute for sound judgment and decision-
making procedures: the more complex and potentially hazardous the operation, the more detailed
the mission planning. Additionally, units are encouraged to develop matrixes specifically
tailored to their individual operational requirements.
A3.4. Water survival training operations, particularly when conducted in ―open water‖ or when
utilizing compressed air, pose a variety of unique risks that must be accounted for. MAJCOMs
will ensure units develop detailed operating instructions/plans of instruction (OIs/POIs) to ensure
overall objective accomplishment and risk management. Procedures must include location of
decompression chambers and chamber access procedures. The following outlines specific SERE
Specialist/support element requirements when conducting water survival training operations:
   A3.4.1. Certified lifeguard.
       A3.4.1.1. CPR qualified instructors or support personnel.
   A3.4.2. Units are encouraged to conduct training operations in an open water environment.
   Additional requirements for open water operations are as follows:
       A3.4.2.1. All participants will be equipped with adequate flotation.
       A3.4.2.2. Ensure adequate medical coverage is available.
   A3.4.3. Rotary-wing requirements.        In addition to environmental factors, medical
   considerations, recovery TTP, etc. training for rotary-wing crewmembers will also include
   ―hands-on‖ application of the Helicopter Emergency Egress Device (HEED) for assigned
   aircrews. Additionally, units are encouraged to utilize the Shallow Water Egress Trainer
   (SWET) as a method of reinforcing ―hard skill‖ requirements associated with underwater
   egress. When conducting hands on HEED and SWET operations, the OIs/POI will also
   include the following additional requirements:
       A3.4.3.1. SERE Specialists conducting HEED training require a thorough understanding
       of dive physiology. Personnel may receive this training either through basic civilian dive
       courses, military dive certification, or through in-unit continuation training.
       A3.4.3.2. To ensure aircrew safety, HEED and/or SWET training must be conducted in a
       controlled environment, i.e., swimming pool. Depth for personnel utilizing the HEED
       apparatus will not exceed 4 feet.
       A3.4.3.3. SWET. As a minimum, training objectives should require participants to clear
       the HEED bottle under water using both approved techniques (IAW US Navy HEED
       video) and breath successfully under water, maintain reference point, release, and
 48                                               AFI16-1301_AFMCSUP_I 14 JULY 2010


       effectively egress the SWET. Participants will be required to demonstrate proficiency
       with the HEED bottle prior to entering the SWET.
A3.5. The matrixes identify basic concepts needed for consideration when conducting water
survival training. These concepts apply when conducting operations in both open and protected
waters.

                             PR KIT/EQUIPMENT GUIDANCE

A4.1. Personnel Recovery Kits (PRK) or equipment, provide High-Risk-of-Capture (HRC)
personnel with essential equipment, tools and items necessary for successful evasion in specific
non-permissive environments. They are designed to supplement/augment AF Issued Survival
vest/kits, which are of a global nature. They should contain items that support the Combatant
Commander's PR plan by including items that aid in evasion and recovery events and enhance
the isolated person's ability to survive and evade. PRKs should be tailored to specific units and
missions when possible.
   A4.1.1. Coordinate unit's PRK requirements through the chain of command to respective
   SERE MFMs prior to acquisition. To ensure unity of effort, uniformity, life cycle, and
   supportability of kit items SERE MFMs will coordinate with theater recovery coordination
   centers (i.e., JSRC, RCC, Air Operations Center (AOC), etc.) to ensure interoperability and
   feasibility of PRK items into PR JTTP.
   A4.1.2. SERE SMEs are responsible for recommending items, containers, employment
   methods and conducting necessary PRK training events.
   A4.1.3. HRC personnel should employ PRKs during CST events and PR exercises and
   become familiar with the items. They must possess a thorough understanding of effective
   tactics, techniques and procedures for their employment, zeroization, destruction, and care
   and use while under field conditions.
   A4.1.4. Include PRK items as part of the individuals Evasion Plan of Action. In the event of
   a recovery effort, PRK information for missing personnel must be quickly passed by a secure
   means to the servicing recovery center.
   A4.1.5. PRKs should, as a minimum, contain Evasion Charts (EVC), small nighttime
   signaling devices, Blood Chit, and Pointee-Talkees of the Area of Operations.
   A4.1.6. Additional PRK items should address the specific needs required for successful
   evasion in a specified area of responsibility (AOR) and enhance the isolated person's ability
   to navigate, signal, hide, survive, and facilitate recovery. PRKs can include global
   positioning system (GPS) receivers, infrared lights, camouflage netting, insulated clothing,
   large capacity water containers etc. PRK contents are limited to mission, platform, egress
   procedures, and need.
   A4.1.7. The specific size and placement of the PRK on personnel should be closely
   scrutinized. If worn/placed on personnel equipped with ejection seats, ensure the PRK does
   not impose a windblast hazard. Contact the local wing safety office and the group Life
   Support Officer if there is safety concerns for the PRK. If safety is in doubt, AFMC's Test
   Parachutist Program (TPP) at Edwards AFB, CA, and the 311th Human Systems Wing,
   Brooks AFB, TX should evaluate PRKs for impact of emergency egress procedures.
