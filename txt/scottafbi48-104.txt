Terms
ALARA Concept—Concept based on the philosophy that all exposures to radioactive materials
and radiation-producing sources must be limited to the lowest possible levels. This statement
presupposes that no exposures to radiation should occur without a positive net benefit. Implicit
in this assumption is that an exposure to radiation, however small, carries with it some detriment
or probability of risk that should be balanced by an offsetting benefit. While the established
SCOTTAFBI48-104 6 OCTOBER 2009                                                                 7


maximum permissible exposure levels are conservative and offer a low risk of adverse health
effects compared to other hazards of life and occupation, it is prudent that every effort be made
to reduce exposures to the lowest level possible. The ALARA approach appears to best satisfy
the need for a practical, yet conservative goal to limit personnel exposure to radiation.
Base Radiation Safety Officer (RSO)—An individual appointed in writing by the installation
commander to manage the Radiation Safety Program.
Permit RSO—An individual designated by the unit commander and approved by the USAF
Radioisotope Committee to manage the radiation protection aspects associated with the use of
RAMs for which a specific USAF Radioactive Material Permit has been issued. Notification
should be given to the BEF of the designation of a permit RSO and any subsequent changes.
Unit RSO—An individual appointed by the organizational commander, who manages RAM
covered under a permit and/or RF emitters, in accordance with AFI 48-148, Ionizing Radiation
Protection. The unit RSO may manage other ionizing or non-ionizing radiation sources in
accordance with applicable regulations. The unit RSO should be appointed, in writing, and
notification given to the BEF of appointment and subsequent changes.
