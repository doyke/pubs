A3.1. BOARD PRESIDENT
  A3.1.1. Be familiar with LUKEAFBI 36-2802 and ensure strict adherence to this instruction.
  A3.1.2. Oversee board operations and serve as a scoring board member as applicable.
  A3.1.3. Complete the Board President Tally Sheet (Attachment 8 for enlisted and
  commissioned awards and Attachment 10 for civilian awards) according to instructions.
  A3.1.4. Upon board completion, immediately return completed Board President Tally Sheet,
  Board Member Score Sheets and all packages to 56 FW/CCCA.
A3.2. BOARD MEMBERS (TO INCLUDE PRESIDENT)
  A3.2.1. First, review the Board Member Score Sheet (Attachment 7 for enlisted and
  commissioned awards and Attachment 9 for civilian awards). Note what each category is
  worth, how the points are broken down, and the fact that all accomplishments must have
  occurred during the award period. Ensure each bullet is in the proper category.
  A3.2.2. Finally, find a quiet space and objectively review each package in detail. Judge how
  important each bullet is, based on your own intellect, experience and common sense. Do not
  bring in your own knowledge of the person, just the facts contained on the AF Form 1206
  and SURF. Grade each nomination package individually, awarding points based on three
  factors: the acts performed, their impact, and scope of responsibility. Assign the proper
  points and rank accordingly. It is important to take notes during the scoring process so you
  are prepared to openly discuss scoring considerations if the Board President deems
  necessary. Complete ALL blanks on EACH score sheet and return completed Awards Board
  Score Sheets to the Board President. Also, though you may not know for certain whom the
  overall category recommendation will be, you may develop a good idea based on the content
  of the packages and board proceedings. It is your duty to maintain secrecy. Do not tell
  anyone until AFTER the awards luncheon or banquet.
