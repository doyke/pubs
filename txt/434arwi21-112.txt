   Chapter 10 and AFI 11-301, AFRC Sup 1, Chapter 3.
   1.2. Flight CC/Shop Chief Responsibilities:
       1.2.1. Designate CTK custodians for each section/shop or squadron.
 2                                                         434ARWI21-112 4 JANUARY 2012


        1.2.2. Ensure CTKs are constructed, identified and required for their work centers.
        1.2.3. Ensure all areas that require special purpose tools and equipment have the items
        that meet the airframe/work area requirements.
        1.2.4. Flight Chiefs or their designated CTK Custodian must annually approve, sign and
        install a copy of the master inventory listing (MIL) in each of their CTK’s.
        1.2.5. Ensure a signed copy of the MIL is located in each CTK for inventory purposes.
        1.2.6. Ensures a copy of the MIL for each CTK is annotated and TC-Max is updated
        when a tool is reported as lost, broken, and missing or removed.
     1.3. CTK Custodian Responsibilities:
        1.3.1. Maintain accountability and control of tools, HAZMAT, and consumables.
        1.3.2. Ensure special tools, TMDE and equipment requiring inspections or calibrations
        are current prior to dispatching.
        1.3.3. Maintain lost/missing tool/object hard copy documentation for 1 year if the tool is
        not immediately found. Continue to store the lost/missing tool/object information in the
        TC-Max database.
     1.4. Procedures for warranted tool management.
        1.4.1. Warranted and replacement tools shall be purchased by the individual work center
        supervisor or his designated representative and managed utilizing TC-Max.
2. Tool Accountability.
     2.1. Inventory Requirements:
        2.1.1. Tools will be controlled through the TC-Max program. The technician assumes
        responsibility for the CTK/tool(s) when their employee number and the CTK ID number
        are entered into the TC-Max computer and by performing an inventory of the contents of
        the CTK. The individual is relieved of responsibility for the CTK/tool(s) by a different
        person entering the CTK/tool(s) ID number into the TC-Max computer and performing
        the turn-in inventory. The inventory of all dispatchable CTK’s shall be documented on an
        AFRC Form 177 at the beginning and end of each job at the job site.
           2.1.1.1. The operator inspection for all equipment except AGE will be completed and
           considered documented when the item is signed out in TC-Max.
        2.1.2. Procedures for 2nd party inventory/inspection of tool kits.
           2.1.2.1. The use of a “shop” or “ghost” account to sign-in/out items is strictly
           prohibited. On the occasions when a single person must sign in and sign out a tool kit,
           the item will be signed out in TC-Max and signed in on an AFRC Form 177
           maintained solely for that purpose. A “second look” inspection will be completed and
           documented as soon as possible but not later than the start of the next duty shift. The
           “second look” inspection will be documented on the same AFRC Form 177 and the
           individual completing the “second look” will sign the item into TC-Max. For CTK’s
           where keys are tracked in TC-Max (i.e. Truck CTK’s) this process will be used if a
434ARWI21-112 4 JANUARY 2012                                                                   3


        single person signs the first and last entry of the AF Form 177 of each TC-Max
        transaction.
     2.1.3. Equipment or CTKs that are not expected to be returned prior to the end of the
     current work shift are documented as long-term issues (LTI) or TDY.
  2.2. Procedures for transfer of tools/CTKs.
     2.2.1. In the event a CTK/equipment item is transferred to another technician on the job,
     the following actions are taken:
        2.2.1.1. TC-Max CTK/equipment transfer and documentation procedures are
        performed at the tool room/workcenter prior to going to the job site.
        2.2.1.2. Both arriving and departing technicians inventory the CTK/equipment at the
        job site and sign the AFRC 177.
  2.3. Truck CTKs:
     2.3.1. CTKs installed in trucks are permitted.
        2.3.1.1. The keys for truck CTKs will be controlled through the owning workcenter
        TC-Max and AFRC Form 175 and 177 will be maintained with the CTK.
        2.3.1.2. Users of truck CTKs are responsible for performing and documenting
        inventory checks at the beginning and end of each job on an AFRC Form 177.
  2.4. Special Tool Cabinets/CTK’s.
     2.4.1. Due to the unique nature of their specialties the Powered Support (MG), Structural
     Repair (MS), and Metals Technology (MT) sections are authorized to utilize a Special
     Tool Cabinet /CTK.
     2.4.2. Each item contained in the Special Tool Cabinet/CTK will be marked with a
     unique TC-Max ID and loaded in TC-Max as an equipment item and the cabinet will be
     loaded in TC-Max as a CTK with all items being listed on the MIL. The cabinet may be
     utilized as a non-dispatchable CTK for normal day to day operations. The cabinet must
     contain all documentation and follow all procedures for CTK’s contained within this
     instruction and all others that apply.
     2.4.3. On the occasion that a special tool is needed outside of the shop area, the tool will
     be issued from TC-Max as a piece of equipment. The Issue/Return is also documented on
     a separate AFRC Form 177.
     2.4.4. Broken or removed tools will be documented as required for CTK’s and will also
     be documented in TC-Max under the unique TC-Max ID number.
     2.4.5. The cabinet may be closed as a CTK provided all removed tools are documented.
     If the cabinet is closed as a CTK when the removed item is returned the cabinet must be
     reopened as a CTK and an inventory must be accomplished IAW paragraph 2.1. of this
     instruction. Items not expected to be returned by the end of the current work shift will be
     documented as long term issue in TC-Max under the unique TC-Max ID and on the
     AFRC 177, under the CTK they will be documented as removed in TC-Max and on all
     copies of the MIL.
 4                                                          434ARWI21-112 4 JANUARY 2012


        2.4.6. All tools contained within these cabinets must be reasonably considered to be
        “special”. Any tool that is common or is used for multiple tasks must be controlled by
        standard tool control procedures.
     2.5. Personal Protective Equipment.
        2.5.1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) may be maintained in personal lockers and
        will be marked with TC-Max and the issue date will be tracked in TC-Max Note: The
        issue date may be updated annually to provide a means for accountability.
3. Marking and Tool Identification.
     3.1. Tools shall be marked with the CTK designation as per attachment 1 of this ARWI.

        4.2.1. Control of locally manufactured tools and equipment will be the same as all other
        tools and equipment.
5. Tool Room Operation and Security.
     5.1. Procedures for controlled access to tool rooms.
        5.1.1. Tool rooms will be located in an area where the access can be limited when 24
        hour coverage is not available. When this is not possible CTK’s and equipment need to
        be stored in a manner as to prevent unauthorized use or access.
     5.2. Procedures for dual operation tool rooms.
        5.2.1. Remote workcenters include the PE Dock, truck mounted, Refurbishment and
        Wash Rack tool boxes. The security check performed by the remote workcenter
        representative will include all CTKs that are physically located there. The responsibility
        for maintaining, inspecting, and inventorying these CTKs will remain with the owning
        workcenter.
     5.3. CTK Security:
        5.3.1. All CTKs will have a locking device to prevent unauthorized removal or use of
        tools.
        5.3.2. All dispatchable tool boxes will be closed and locked when left unattended at
        worksites.
     5.4. Procedures for TC-Max downtime:

to prevent duplication of CTK numbers presently in use at Grissom (Air Reserve Base) ARB,
Indiana. All sections/shops will use U2 as the first two characters of the 9-digit Equipment
Identification. Each section/shop will use the following codes for the third and fourth characters.
