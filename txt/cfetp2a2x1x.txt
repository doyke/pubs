manage and conduct an effective training program. The guidance provided in this part of the
CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their
career. Use table 8.1 Enlisted Career Path in conjunction with information below to
manage career skill progression.

5.1. Apprentice (3-level). Upon completion of initial skills training, a trainee will work
with a trainer to enhance their knowledge and skills. The apprentice will enter UGT using
the CDC, and QT to progress in the career field. Minimum training times will be a total of
12 months for normal UGT and 9 months for retrainees. Once task certified, a trainee may
                                               9
perform the task unsupervised. Apprentices can be considered for appointment as unit
trainers after completion of a formal trainer course.

5.2. Journeyman (5-level). Once upgraded to the 5-level, the journeyman will enter into
continuation training to broaden their experience base by increasing their knowledge and
skill in troubleshooting and solving more complex problems. Five-levels may be assigned
job positions such as quality assurance and various staff positions. After having 48 months
in the Air Force, 5-levels will attend Airman Leadership School (ALS) to enhance their
Professional Military Education (PME). Five-levels will be considered for appointment as
unit trainers. Individuals will use their CDCs to prepare for Weighted Airman Promotion
testing. They should also consider continuing their education toward a Community College
of the Air Force (CCAF) degree.

5.3. Craftsman (7-level). A craftsman can expect to fill various supervisory and
management positions such as shift leader, element NCOIC, flight/section chief, and task
certifier. They are the primary trainers of those trainees working toward advancement to the
5- and 7-skill levels. They can also be assigned to work in staff positions. Craftsmen should
take courses to obtain added knowledge on management of resources and personnel.
Minimum training times for UGT to the craftsman 7-skill level will be a total of 12 months
for normal UGT and 6 months for retrainees. Continued academic education through CCAF
and higher degree programs is encouraged. In addition, when promoted to TSgt, individuals
will complete the Noncommissioned Officer Academy and MSgt selects are highly
encouraged to complete the Senior NCO Academy by correspondence.

5.4. Superintendent (9-level). Before attaining the 9-skill level, individuals must be
SMSgt. A 9-skill level is expected to fill positions such as flight chief, production supervisor,
and various staff NCOIC jobs. Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower,
resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing education.
Additional higher education and completion of courses outside their career AFSC are also
recommended.

6. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to
encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the SOF/PR Integrated
Communication/ Navigation/ Mission Systems Career Field. The spectrum includes a
strategy for when, where, and how to meet these training requirements. The strategy must be
apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach
to training. Refer to paragraph 10 of this document for a complete list of specialty
qualification requirements.

7. Higher Education and Advanced Certification Opportunities. Higher education and
advanced certification is a personal choice that is encouraged for the professional
development of the entire Enlisted Force. Listed below are some current opportunities:

Section D - RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS

11. Purpose. This section of the CFETP identifies known resource constraints, which
preclude optimum and desired training from being developed or conducted, including
information such as cost and manpower. Narrative explanations of each resource constraint
and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint has on training are included.
Also included in this section are actions required, office of primary responsibility, and target
completion dates. Resource constraints will be, as a minimum, reviewed and updated
annually.

12. Apprentice Level Training.

12.1. Low Power Color Weather Radar (LPCWR), Enhanced Traffic Alert and

                                               15
12.1.1. Constraints. Trainers are not available for the Apprentice course to satisfy the
requirement for operational checks on a LPCWR, ETCAS and DI systems. The JTRS is
currently not being developed for AF use but could be revised at a later date.

12.1.1.1. Impacts. Apprentice students will not be able perform hands-on operational checks
(proficiency code ‘2b’) on LPCWR, ETCAS, and DI systems. Instead, they will receive
training on step-by-step procedures to perform ops checks (proficiency code ‘b’) and will
receive hands-on training with the systems currently available at the schoolhouse. They also
will not receive training for basic facts and terms (proficiency code ‘A’) pertaining to
purpose, characteristics and theory of operations on the JTRS because the system is
unavailable. Proficiency code ‘2b/b’ will be entered in column 4A for the respective STS line
items for LPCWR, ETCAS and DI, and ‘A/x’ will be entered on line items for JTRS.

12.1.1.2. Resources Required. Funds to acquire new trainers or modify existing trainers
capable of performing operational checks on LPCWR, ETCAS and DI systems are needed.

12.1.1.3. Actions Required. A lead command must be established to champion acquisition
of training systems.

PART II

Section A –SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD

1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by Air Education
and Training Command (AETC) once all training resources are funded.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, and AFI 36-2232 this STS:

2.1. Lists in the column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common
tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties in the
3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.

2.2. Identifies in column 2 (Core Tasks) by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training
requirements. For upgrade training only those tasks designated as core requirements by the
AFCFM (by an asterisk in column 2) need to be trained and certified. MAJCOM Functional
Managers, commanders, and supervisors may designate additional critical tasks for duty
position qualification, as necessary. When designated, certify the duty position critical tasks
using normal task certification procedures. Exemptions:

2.2.1. Core tasks that are not applicable to base assigned aircraft or equipment are not
required for upgrade (units are not required to send personnel TDY for core task training)

2.2.2. For units with more than one mission design aircraft, upgrade trainees need only
complete core tasks on a single mission design. MFMs, unit commanders, and/or supervisors
may require trainees to complete core task training on additional mission design aircraft, if
desired. If some of these core tasks involve training in another unit on base, trainees must
still complete all core tasks relevant to at least one mission design aircraft. All units are
bound by the requirements in this CFETP and will accommodate core task trainees from
other units.

2.2.3. Units that use the G081 maintenance data collection system do not need to complete
Core Automated Maintenance System (CAMS) or Integrated Maintenance Data System
(IMDS) Computer Based Training (CBT) core tasks. Units that use CAMS/IMDS do not
need to complete G081 CBT core tasks.

2.3. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and
knowledge training requirements. Use CAMS/IMDS/G081 to document technician
qualifications, if available. Task certification must show a certification or completed date.

2.4. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the
proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as result of training on the
task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.

2.5. Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to
indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career
development courses.


                                               17
2.6. Job Qualification Standard. The STS becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for
on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record, and used
according to AFI 36-2201. For OJT, the tasks in column 1 are trained and qualified to the
go/no go level. "Go" means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets
local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct procedures. When used as a JQS, the
following requirements apply:

2.6.1. Documentation. Document and certify completion of training IAW AFI 36-2201.
Use of Part II, attachments one, two, three, and at least one of attachments four through
twenty-one is required in individual training records.

2.6.1.1. Transcribing from Old CFETP to New CFETP. All AFJQSs and previous
CFETPs are replaced by this CFETP; therefore, transcribing of all training records to this
CFETP STS is mandatory. Use this CFETP STS (or automated STS) to identify and certify
all past and current qualifications. Document and certify all previous and current training
IAW AFI 36-2201.

2.7. STS. A guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman
Promotion System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF
Occupational Measurement Squadron, by Senior NCOs with extensive practical experience
in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test
development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions
are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog. Individual responsibilities are
in AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion Program. WAPS is not applicable to the Air National
Guard or Air Force Reserve.

3. Recommendations. Comments and recommendations are invited concerning the quality
of training AETC graduates received. A 782 TRG Customer Service Information Line
(CSIL) is available for supervisors to identify a graduate’s training concerns on
tasks/knowledge items listed in this STS. Please reference specific STS line items and
address your comments to: 782CSIL@us.af.mil or call the CSIL at DSN 736-2574 anytime.

Section B – 3-LEVEL COURSE OBJECTIVES

4. Introduction. Each proficiency coded STS task or knowledge item taught at the
technical school is measured through the use of an objective. An objective is a written
instruction for the student so he or she knows what is expected of them to successfully
complete training on each task. Each objective is comprised of a condition, behavior, and
standard that states what is expected of the student for each task. The condition is the setting
in which the training takes place (i.e. TOs, type of equipment, etc). The behavior is the
observable portion of the objective (i.e. perform an operational check). The standard is the
level of performance that is measured to ensure the STS proficiency code level is attained
(i.e. “with no more than two instructor assists”).

5. Objective Measurement. Each objective uses letter codes(s) to identify how it is
measured. All objectives using the PC code indicate a progress check is used to measure
subject or task knowledge. W indicates a comprehensive written test and is used to measure
the subject or task knowledge at the end of a block of instruction. PC/W indicates a subject

                                               18
or task knowledge progress check and a separate measurement of both knowledge and
performance elements using a written test.

6. Objective Standard. The standard for written examinations is 70% to 72%. Standards
for performance objectives are indicated in the objective and are also indicated on the
individual progress check checklist. The checklist is used by the instructor to document each
student’s progress, on each task. Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the
progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until
satisfactory performance is attained. Students must satisfactorily complete all PCs prior to
taking the written test.

7. Proficiency Level. Review column 4A of the STS to determine the proficiency level of a
particular task or knowledge item. Review the proficiency code key in Part II, Section A of
this CFETP for an explanation of the proficiency codes. Most task performance is taught to
the ‘2b’ proficiency level which means the students can do most parts of the task, but does
need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient). The student can also
determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.
(Example: b and 1b)
**A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a
subject common to several tasks.
- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.
/ This mark is used in course columns to show that training is required but not given/reduced due to limitations in resources. (3c/b, 2/b/b, 3c/-,
etc.)

X This mark is used alone in course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.

NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency or knowledge code are trained during wartime.

Attachment 2 – General Training Requirements
This general training requirements section is used to show necessary changes to the individual CFETP STS line items, for all the 2A2X1
shreds, in order to have the same level requirements across the shreds.
  NOTE 1: The apprentice course, J3ABR2A231_048A, SOF/PR Integrated Comm/Nav/Mission Systems Apprentice, will use
             representative aircraft/trainers to accomplish the system specific training requirements as identified by the specific STS. The
             general training requirements section of the CFETP is used to code core competencies of the career field that will be taught in
             the apprentice course. The MDS specific attachments are to be used in conjunction with the general and common sections to
             identify work center requirements and annotate qualifications.
  NOTE 2: All course requirements are trained in the 3-level resident course during wartime.
  NOTE 3: Users are responsible for annotating training references to identify current references pending STS revision.
  NOTE 4: Items marked in Column 4A with both a proficiency code and a dash will be taught if equipment is available (Ex: 2b/-).
  NOTE 5: Items coded in Column 2A or 2B of the General Attachment are core tasks. If the STS line item identified with an “*” does
             not apply to a procedure, aircraft MDS, or equipment at a given base, the completion of the core task in the General
             Attachment is waived.
  NOTE 6: Address comments or recommend changes through the MAJCOM Functional Manager to the AETC Training Manager at DSN

Attachment 3 SOF C-130 EQUIPMENT Training Requirements
 NOTE 1: The apprentice course, J3ABR2A2X1X048A, Communication/Countermeasures/Navigation Systems Apprentice, will use
         representative aircraft/trainers to accomplish the system specific training requirements as identified by the specific STS. The
         general training requirements section of the CFETP is used to code core competencies of the career field that will be taught in
         the apprentice course. The MDS specific attachments are to be used in conjunction with the general and common sections to
         identify work center requirements and annotate qualifications.
 NOTE 2: All course requirements are trained in the 3-level resident course during wartime.
 NOTE 3: Users are responsible for annotating training references to identify current references pending STS revision.
 NOTE 4: Items marked in Column 4A with both a proficiency code and a dash will be taught if equipment is available (Ex: 2b/-).
 NOTE 5: Items coded in Column 2A or 2B of the General Attachment are core tasks. If the STS line item identified with an “*” does
         not apply to a procedure, aircraft MDS, or equipment at a given base, the completion of the core task in the General
         Attachment is waived.
 NOTE 6: Address comments or recommend changes through the MAJCOM Functional Manager to the AETC Training Manager at DSN

Attachment 4 SOF OFF EQUIPMENT Training Requirements
 NOTE 1: The apprentice course, J3ABR2A2X1X048A, Communication/Countermeasures/Navigation Systems Apprentice, will use
         representative aircraft/trainers to accomplish the system specific training requirements as identified by the specific STS. The
         general training requirements section of the CFETP is used to code core competencies of the career field that will be taught in
         the apprentice course. The MDS specific attachments are to be used in conjunction with the general and common sections to
         identify work center requirements and annotate qualifications.
 NOTE 2: All course requirements are trained in the 3-level resident course during wartime.
 NOTE 3: Users are responsible for annotating training references to identify current references pending STS revision.
 NOTE 4: Items marked in Column 4A with both a proficiency code and a dash will be taught if equipment is available (Ex: 2b/-).
 NOTE 5: Items coded in Column 2A or 2B of the General Attachment are core tasks. If the STS line item identified with an “*” does
         not apply to a procedure, aircraft MDS, or equipment at a given base, the completion of the core task in the General
         Attachment is waived.
 NOTE 6: Address comments or recommend changes through the MAJCOM Functional Manager to the AETC Training Manager at DSN

Attachment 5 CV-22 Training Requirements
 NOTE 1: The apprentice course, J3ABR2A2X1X048A, Communication/Countermeasures/Navigation Systems Apprentice, will use
         representative aircraft/trainers to accomplish the system specific training requirements as identified by the specific STS. The
         general training requirements section of the CFETP is used to code core competencies of the career field that will be taught in
         the apprentice course. The MDS specific attachments are to be used in conjunction with the general and common sections to
         identify work center requirements and annotate qualifications.
 NOTE 2: All course requirements are trained in the 3-level resident course during wartime.
 NOTE 3: Users are responsible for annotating training references to identify current references pending STS revision.
 NOTE 4: Items marked in Column 4A with both a proficiency code and a dash will be taught if equipment is available (Ex: 2b/-).
 NOTE 5: Items coded in Column 2A or 2B of the General Attachment are core tasks. If the STS line item identified with an “*” does
         not apply to a procedure, aircraft MDS, or equipment at a given base, the completion of the core task in the General
         Attachment is waived.
 NOTE 6: Address comments or recommend changes through the MAJCOM Functional Manager to the AETC Training Manager at DSN

Attachment 6 HH-60 Training Requirements
 NOTE 1: The apprentice course, J3ABR2A2X1X048X, Communication/Countermeasures/Navigation Systems Apprentice, will use
         representative aircraft/trainers to accomplish the system specific training requirements as identified by the specific STS. The
         general training requirements section of the CFETP is used to code core competencies of the career field that will be taught in
         the apprentice course. The MDS specific attachments are to be used in conjunction with the general and common sections to
         identify work center requirements and annotate qualifications.
 NOTE 2: All course requirements are trained in the 3-level resident course during wartime.
 NOTE 3: Users are responsible for annotating training references to identify current references pending STS revision.
 NOTE 4: Items marked in Column 4A with both a proficiency code and a dash will be taught if equipment is available (Ex: 2b/-).
 NOTE 5: Items coded in Column 2A or 2B of the General Attachment are core tasks. If the STS line item identified with an “*” does not
         apply to a procedure, aircraft MDS, or equipment at a given base, the completion of the core task in the General Attachment is
         waived.
 NOTE 6: Address comments or recommend changes through the MAJCOM Functional Manager to the AETC Training Manager at DSN
