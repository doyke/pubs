This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance. Its
purpose is to establish procedural guidance for the identification and subsequent reporting of dropped
objects from unit aircraft. It applies to all 302 Airlift Wing (AW) personnel involved in the maintenance
and operation of aircraft. This publication references Air Force Instructions (AFI) 10-206, Operational
Reporting, Air Force Reserve Instructions (AFRCI) 10-203, United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR)
Command and Control, 302 Airlift Wing Instructions (AWI) 21-101, Aircraft Impoundment Procedures,
T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance General Policies and Procedures, and T.O.
1C-130A-6, Aircraft Scheduled Inspection and Maintenance Requirement. It further augments Air Force
Instruction (AFI) 21-101, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Sup1, Aerospace Equipment Mainte-
nance Management, AFI 11-2C-130, Volume 3, C-130 Operations Procedures, and AFI 91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports.


1. General Information.
   1.1. A dropped object is defined as any aircraft part, component, surface, or other item lost during air-
   crew operations (unless intentionally jettisoned), from engine start to engine shutdown.
   1.2. Inadvertent release of chaff or flares, or the release of a quantity in excess of the number selected
   by the aircrew, will not constitute dropped object reporting. Instead, report such incidents in accor-
   dance with (IAW) AFI 91-204 procedures.

2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. The Maintenance Group (MXG) Commander will serve as the Dropped Object Prevention Pro-
   gram (DOP) program manager and will appoint a member of the MXG Quality Assurance Office
   (MXQ) as the Wing DOP monitor. An alternate monitor from MXQ will also be appointed to ensure
   consistency of investigating and reporting all incidents.

    2.2. The Wing DOP monitor/alternate will:
       2.2.1. Immediately investigate all reported dropped objects and comply with reporting such inci-
       dents IAW AFI 21-101/AFRC Sup1, Chapter 18. (Telephone or e-mail 22 Air Force (AF)/LGMA
       and Head Quarters (HQ) AFRC/LGMAC upon initial report and follow-up with a formal report to
       both agencies using the AFI 21-101 format.)
       2.2.2. Ensure training standards are reviewed periodically for consistency with current Air Force
       directives.
       2.2.3. Ensure a Deficiency Report (DR) is submitted to the unit DR monitor if a material or design
       deficiency is suspected or causal.
       2.2.4. Submit DOP agenda items to the Wing FOD monitor and attend all Foreign Object Dam-
       age/Debris (FOD) meetings, presenting issues with potential for downstream FOD.
       2.2.5. Document DOP incidents in the Quality Assurance Tracking and Trend Analysis System
       (QANTTAS) and forward a copy of the final report (QANTTAS-generated) to all affected agen-
       cies for incorporation in their education and training programs.
    2.3. Airframe Powerplant General (APG) personnel will conduct a post-recovery visual inspection
    for loose or damaged components/panels of all aircraft that have performed landings on unimproved/
    substandard airfields, regardless of whether or not a Thruflight Inspection is required.
    2.4. Any aircrew or maintenance personnel who discovers an object has possibly been dropped from
    an aircraft, will make the appropriate entries in the aircraft AFTO IMT 781A, Maintenance Discrep-
    ancy and Work Document, or AMC IMT 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occur-
    rence Worksheet, if required immediately following aircraft recovery/discovery, as appropriate.
    Contact will be made with Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) or the controlling agency via the
    most expeditious means available in accordance with (IAW) AFI 11-2C-130V3, Chapter 6. The fol-
    lowing functions will be notified, in turn:
       2.4.1. Expediter and/or Pro Super.
       2.4.2. Maintenance Operations Center (MOC).
       2.4.3. Wing DOP monitor.
       2.4.4. Command Post.
       2.4.5. Flight Safety Officer.
       2.4.6. Airfield Manager (if the incident occurred during any portion of the flight sequence involv-
       ing operations at Peterson AFB or the Colorado Springs Municipal Airport).
    2.5. The Command Post will accomplish a “BEELINE” report, if the dropped object meets the
    requirements of AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting or AFRCI 10-203, United States Air Force
    Reserve (USAFR) Command and Control.
    2.6. The Flight Safety Officer will accomplish reporting requirements if the incident meets the criteria
    for reporting IAW AFI 91-204.
    2.7. Operations and Maintenance managers must consider if impoundment of the aircraft should be
    considered based on the apparent nature of the incident reported. Use 302 Airlift Wing Instruction
302AWI21-104 15 SEPTEMBER 2004                                                                             3


   (AWI) 21-101, Aircraft Impoundment Procedures, as a guide to determine conditions warranting
   impoundment.

3. Prevention.
   3.1. Maintenance personnel will ensure that all items removed from the aircraft exterior are accounted
   for using Technical Order (T.O.) 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance General Policies and
   Procedures, for documentation of such actions. Installation/reinstallation of removed items will
   always involve the use of the applicable maintenance directives, appropriate hardware/fasteners, and
   the required fit tolerances specified.
   3.2. Maintenance personnel conducting Abbreviated T.O. 1C-130A-6, Aircraft Scheduled Inspection
   and Maintenance Requirement, inspections (preflight, thruflight, Isochronal, etc.), production inspec-
   tors, and aircrew will pay particular attention during visual inspections of the aircraft exterior, ensur-
   ing any observed defects concerning the attachment and fit of all exterior components and surfaces are
   identified and corrected.

4. Training.
   4.1. In conjunction with Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) requirements, applicable
   Maintenance Group work centers will ensure personnel annually review the Dropped Object Preven-
   tion program training video. Copies of recent unit or Major Command (MAJCOM) Dropped Object
   Reports will be made available for review to focus personnel on the items that have potential DOP sig-
   nificance.
   4.2. Aircrew personnel will incorporate DOP awareness and prevention into their applicable training
   programs, with particular emphasis placed on the reporting process.
