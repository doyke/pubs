1. Responsibilities: Commanders, facility managers, and housing occupants are responsible for
ensuring individual and master keys are controlled according to this instruction.
2. General.
   2.1. Malmstrom AFB uses a grand master key system. There are multiple patterns to be used
   with this system. Patterns are designated by 341 CES base locksmith for each facility.
   2.2. Lock and Key Responsibility. 341 CES is responsible for the overall management of all
   door locks and keys on Malmstrom AFB base and missile field facilities. The MFH, and 341
   MDG will manage their own key system. Billeting (cardkey systems) will be managed and
   maintained by the 341st Force Support Squadron (341 FSS).

     2.3. Special Use Systems:
        2.3.1. Cipher locks will be approved on a case-by-case basis by the Base Civil Engineer
        (BCE). Cipher locks on both interior and exterior doors must include a key bypass and a
        timeout tamper function that delays the code entry after an incorrect code. All approved
        cipher lock systems will be purchased by the requesting organization and installed,
        maintained, and repaired by the 341 CES. Code and battery changes will be performed
        by the using organization.
        2.3.2. Remotely operated electric door openers will be authorized in facilities such as
        command posts, fire alarm control rooms, or where an attendant is not authorized to leave
        their control station within a locked room. All approved remotely operated electric door
        openers will be funded by the requesting organization and installed, maintained and
        repaired by the 341 CES. Code and battery changes will be performed by the using
        organization.
        2.3.3. Automatic opening doors are authorized for public use facilities where deemed
        appropriate by the BCE. These doors will be funded by the requesting organization and
        installed, maintained, and repaired by the 341 CES.
        2.3.4. Cardkey, optical, or other high security systems will be funded by the requesting
        organization, and will be installed, managed, and maintained by the using organization.
        2.3.5. Requests for GSA safe and vault locks must be submitted on an AF Form 332 and
        approved prior to installation on any facility, vault or security container. These lock
        systems will be installed, repaired, and maintained only by a certified GSA safe and vault
        technician.
3. Base Facility Procedures.
     3.1. General Concept. Each facility will have a separate master lock system with a master
     key to fit all locks in that facility, except mechanical rooms. When a facility is master keyed,
     the Key Control Controller (341 CES/CEOSC) will issue to the primary building manager
     one master key and the number of individual keys requested and justified for that facility.
     3.2. Duplication of Keys. 341 CES/CEOSC will provide additional keys if the request is
     submitted on an AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request (Attachment 2) and
     signed by the facility manager. Requests for additional master keys must have the
     organizational commander’s signature in Blocks 11-13. This AF Form 332 will be delivered
     to 341 CES/CEOSC (Customer Service) for review and approval/accomplishment. If the
     request is approved, a Direct Scheduled Work Order will be issued to the locksmith for
     execution. The locksmith will fabricate the keys and give them to the Key Control
     Controller. The Key Control Controller will issue the keys to the primary facility manager.
     The primary facility manager will be required to sign for the keys. Master keys for the
     custodial contractor will be issued directly to the Custodial Contract Specialist for issue to
     the base custodial contractor.
     3.3. Lock replacement. Arrangements for lock replacement will be made using an AF Form
     332 submitted to 341 CES/CEOSC. When the replacement is required because of obvious
     abuse, vandalism, or burglary, the request must be signed by the organizational commander
     with a copy of the statement of charges or a police report attached. If replacement is required
341MWI32-1002 14 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                     3


   due to inadequate key control by the facility manager or members of the organization, the
   organization will be responsible for the actual expenses required to duplicate keys or replace
   lock cores.
   3.4. Emergency Access. One grand master key will be issued to the Fire Protection Flight
   (341 CES/CEF) and kept in the alarm room. In emergencies, either 341 CES or 341st
   Security Forces Squadron (341 SFS) personnel may sign out this key. The key will be
   returned as soon as possible, but will not be returned beyond 4 hours without calling the
   alarm room with an explanation. A Department of Defense (DoD) picture identification card
   or Company identification badge (for DoD contractors) will be required to sign out this key.
4. Missile Alert Facilities (MAF) and Launch Facilities (LF)
   4.1. Missile Alert Facilities. Each missile squadron FM superintendent will be responsible
   for key control at their five MAFs. When an FM superintendent is changed, the outgoing
   person is required to out process and transfer accountability of keys through 341
   CES/CEOSC.
4. 2. Launch Facilities. Keys and Codes Control Center (KCCC) has the overall
responsibility for key control at the LFs. An internal annual audit will be conducted by the key
control program monitor.
5. Housing Procedures.
   5.1. Military Family Housing is managed and maintained by an independent contractor.
   Direct all questions to the 341 CES Housing Office.
6. Dormitory Procedures.
   6.1. Dormitory rooms have a card key lock which is programmed to the occupant’s Common
   Access Card (CAC).
   6.2. Dormitory Lock Out (Duty day). If a lock out occurs between 0730-1600 the occupant
   will report to CDMO in building 640 for assistance.
6. 3. Dormitory Lock Out (After hours). The occupant will first contact an NCO within
their work center. Both individuals can then proceed to the Base Billeting office, there the NCO
will be briefed on his/her responsibilities prior to signing for the master key.
7. Key Control.
   7.1. Facility manager responsibility. Primary facility managers are responsible for the
   accountability and security of all keys that service their area. Commanders must establish
   security procedures to ensure there is no duplication of keys without the facility manager’s
   knowledge and 341 CES approval. Facility managers are not responsible for keys to
   controlling areas that organizations use for safeguarding specialized equipment, sensitive
   documents, personal tool kits, etc. Facility managers are responsible for collecting all keys
   from personnel on permanent change of station, discharge, or termination of employment.
   Facility managers will establish their own internal key control system. Keys issued to
   personnel going on extended leave or on temporary duty assignment for over 30 days should
   be held by the facility manager for safekeeping. Upon vacating a building or any assigned
   space, the building manager must return all keys to 341 CES/CEAOR.

     7.2. Multi-organizational facilities. Facility keys should remain under one master key
     system. In facilities where more than one master key system is used, each area will have its
     own facility Key control program. Each area will be managed by the designated person
     responsible for their master key system.
     7.3. Facility managers terminated. When primary building managers change, the outgoing
     building manager is required to out-process/transfer accountability of keys through 341
     CES/CEOSC. The outgoing building manager will bring a Facility Manager Assignment
     Letter (Attachment 3) signed by their organizational commander appointing the new facility
     manager and, accompanied by his/her replacement, report to 341 CES/CEOSC to have key
     accountability transferred at that time.
     7.4. Dormitory managers terminated. When primary dormitory managers change, the
     outgoing dormitory manager is required to out-process/transfer accountability of keys
     through 341 CES/CEOSC. The outgoing dormitory manager will bring a Facility Manager
     Assignment Letter signed by their organizational commander appointing the new facility
     manager and coordinated through the 341 CES/CEACD Dormitory Manager. The primary
     dormitory manager accompanied by his/her replacement, must report to 341 CES/CEOSC to
     have key accountability transferred at that time.
8. Authority to Duplicate Keys. No agency or organization other than 341 CES, 341 MDG, or
MFH contractors on Malmstrom AFB has the authority to duplicate keys.
