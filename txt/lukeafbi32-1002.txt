       Squadron Commander level or higher. Some minor work requests do not need Squadron
       Commander approval.

       will provide input to the 56 CES Chief of Programs, on what projects their organization
       wants prioritized. In addition, FPMs will provide input to the 56 CES programmers to
       assist them in completing programming documents.
       4.2.3. Facility Project Monitors will obtain their Group Commander’s priorities for work
       requests that are to be done in-house by the 56 CES.
       4.2.4. Facility Project Monitors will use the Facility Condition Index in determining
       which projects are prioritized the highest. The goal is to give projects that correct
       facilities rated “Q-4” the highest priority, and the lowest priority to work requests
       supporting facilities rated “Q-1.”
