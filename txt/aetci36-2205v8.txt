        appropriate training management database with the proper elimination code.
        1.3.7.7. Provide each student with an out processing checklist to ensure the student
        collects official records/forms and completes course sign-out/graduation actions.
        1.3.7.8. Issue the AF Form 1256, Certificate of Training, upon graduation from the
        formal training course and completion of the out-processing checklist.
1.4. Training Syllabus. The syllabus is directive and must be followed precisely, unless a
waiver request is approved according to Chapter 2.
     1.4.1. Syllabus Interpretation. If no clear syllabus guidance exists, resolve the situation
     using the appropriate chain of command. Only the OPR may interpret syllabus guidance. If
     the logical course of action appears to conflict with other directives, call the OPR listed in the
     syllabus.
     1.4.2. Sortie and Hour Requirements. Each syllabus has a programmed number of sorties,
     flying hours, and total allowable X sorties/aircrew training device (ATD) lessons authorized.
     Unless otherwise specified in the syllabus, additional X sorties/lessons required beyond the
     course limit require AETC/A3Z approval. Proficiency advancement will not be used as a
     management tool to graduate students by a specific date.
     1.4.3. Cockpit Resource Management (CRM) Requirements. The AETC supplement to
     AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, outlines requirements
     for the CRM training program. CRM briefings will discuss the human-factor causes in
     aircraft mishaps. Use real-world mishaps as examples in the briefings. Brief and debrief
     CRM core concepts and skills on every aircraft and simulator mission.
1.5. Equipment Required. See ETCA. Flying clothing, equipment, and special requirements
for individuals attending are shown under clothing, equipment, and requirements in the
individual course descriptions. Follow procedures in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, to acquire
required training equipment (i.e., uniforms and gear) for personnel selected for aircrew training.
Flying clothing, equipment, and special requirement items for ANG and AFRC students must be
issued by the appropriate AFRC or ANG unit before the individual arrives for training. Note: It
is the responsibility of the losing base to provide required training equipment (i.e., flying
clothing, equipment and gear) to personnel selected for aircrew training. The FTU will only issue
those items unique to the formal training school.
1.6. End-of-Course Critiques. Each organization conducting formal training administers an
end-of-course critique program as an integral part of the formal training course. The OG/CC
determines the critique’s content and medium. Supervisors review reports and initiate corrective
action as necessary. Administer the critique within 15 duty days of graduation. Use AETC Form
673, Student Critique, or an approved local critique form for written critiques.
1.7. Aircrew Graduate Evaluation Program (AGEP). Aircrew members who have
completed training through an AETC formal undergraduate or graduate flying training program
will be evaluated on the effectiveness of their previous training according to AETCI 36-2206,
Aircrew Graduate Evaluation Program (AGEP). AETC establishes mandatory AGEP data
capture points, normally defined within syllabus, for courses with pipeline students. Direct
AETCI36-2205V8 30 APRIL 2013                                                                        9


feedback survey content questions and comments to AETC/A3ZS (DSN 487-3732). Contact
AETC/A3F (DSN 487-2045) for questions concerning AGEP Web site access.
1.8. Production Metrics Report. AETC/A3R is the primary point of contact (POC) for flying
training production metrics. At the beginning of each fiscal year, AETC/A3R uploads the PFT
document to the flying training production analysis (FTPA) Web-based input tool. Group
commanders or their designated POCs are responsible for updating FTPA with actual entries,
gains, losses, attritions, graduation numbers, and notes, if needed, to explain wash backs,
attritions, or date changes to a class. Updates are due 5 calendar days after the class start date and
class graduation date.
1.9. Quota Management. For exact formal course training durations, go to the AETC
PFT/Flying Hours/Metrics Programs web page at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AETCPFT. The
PFT document establishes the baseline for student quota management. Quota management
worksheets reflect real-time changes and are the primary source documents for information on
class entry, student load, and production schedules for AETC flying training courses.

                              STUDENT ADMINISTRATION

2.1. In processing. Units will review incoming student records to verify they are complete, and
to determine initial supervision required before any other-than-academic-only formal training
courses. Students must meet course entry prerequisites established by the syllabus and comply
with reporting instructions in the ETCA. At minimum, units will review these student records (or
equivalents):
   2.1.1. Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF). Students, as required by syllabus guidance and
   ETCA reporting instructions, hand-carry the FEF or copy of current AF Forms 8, Certificate
   of Aircrew Qualification, from previous formal training. Depending on aircrew specialty,
   some individuals may not yet possess an FEF. Units will forward applicable AF Form 8 and
   other standardization/evaluation (stan/eval) records and documents to students’ home or
   gaining units upon completion of training.
   2.1.2. Individual Flight Records. Students, as required by syllabus guidance and ETCA
   reporting instructions, hand-carry their individual flight records folders and travel orders.
   Depending on aircrew specialty, some individuals may not yet possess individual flight
   records. In that case, students will hand-carry individual data and training summaries; Flying
   History Report; AF IMT 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational
   Duty; AF IMT 702, Individual Physiological Training Record; and aeronautical orders (AO).
2.2. Waivers. Waiver requests will be completed on AETC Form 6, Waiver Request.
   2.2.1. Entry Prerequisite Waivers. Losing or home unit commanders will ensure students
   meet course entry prerequisites established by the syllabus, AFI 11-2MDS-specific Volumes
   1, and ETCA reporting instructions. Losing/home units will initiate prerequisite entry
   waivers and coordinate with the training location OG/CC, or as delegated.
   2.2.2. Syllabus Execution Waivers. An approved syllabus waiver is required for any
   planned exception to the syllabus caused by special or unusual circumstances. Permanent or
   blanket waivers are not authorized, but should be suggested as syllabus changes to
   AETC/A3ZS. Do not omit or accomplish any training requested in a waiver until notification
   of approval.
   2.2.3. Approval Authorities. When a specific AFI prescribes formal course entry
   prerequisites, the AFI identifies the waiver authority. Except when other governing directives
   instruct otherwise, submit all other waiver requests to these approval authorities: syllabus
   waivers and syllabus entry prerequisite waivers to AETC/A3Z; senior officer syllabus and
   entry prerequisite waivers to AETC/A3 (information copy will be sent to AETC/A3Z).
   Maintain a permanent record of all approved waivers in the student’s grade book.
2.3. Syllabus Variations:
   2.3.1. Syllabus Deviation. A syllabus deviation is any unplanned variation from such
   syllabus requirements as prerequisite flow, turn-times, landing currency, or maneuver item
   file (MIF) requirements. Document all syllabus deviations in the student’s training folder.
   Note: All syllabus directed training must be accomplished unless a waiver request is
   approved, with the following exception: Non-U.S. crewmembers will not complete events
AETCI36-2205V8 30 APRIL 2013                                                                   11


   that are restricted to United States only unless prior written approval was coordinated
   through AETC/IA. If unforeseen circumstances result in an omission of required training, the
   OG/CC will determine if the omitted training can be accomplished later in the syllabus flow
   without adversely affecting the quality of student training. Place documentation in the
   student’s training folder to show OG/CC-directed corrective actions and accomplishment of
   the omitted training.
   2.3.2. Incomplete Training. Training requirements that cannot be accomplished because of
   prolonged equipment, facilities, and/or aircraft shortfalls or limitations will be annotated in
   the student’s training folder. In situations where end-of-course requirements are not achieved
   because of prolonged shortfalls/limitations, stan/eval will also annotate the deficiency on AF
   IMT 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training, AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew
   Certifications, or AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, as appropriate, for
   inclusion in the student’s FEF. (Note: AF IMT 1381 is prescribed in AFI 11-401, Flight
   Management, and AF Form 8 is prescribed in AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew
   Standardization/Evaluation Program. Refer to those publications for guidance on completing
   the forms.)
   2.3.3. Other Than FTU Course Completion. Students must complete all syllabus training
   in order to graduate from the FTU. When students attend training with the intention of
   completing a portion of the training at the home unit, they require a training quota and the
   owning MAJCOM must approve a secondary method of training (SMT) waiver.
   2.3.4. Recall Procedures: According to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training major
   commands (MAJCOM) will notify AETC/A3Z and the FTU prior to recalling a student from
   a formal school course. IAW AETC 36-2205, Volume 1, AETC/A3Z is the approval
   authority for all student recalls and must approve the recall before the student disenrolls or
   departs. Exception: Recalled students may depart in emergency situations, but their flying or
   training records will be held until the recall is approved.
      2.3.4.1. MAJCOMs will notify AETC/A3Z of intent to recall a student; AETC/A3Z will
      notify the FTU OG/CC and registrar.
      2.3.4.2. The registrar will submit an AETC Form 126G, Record of Commander's Review
      Action, to AETC/A3Z for approval.
      2.3.4.3. AETC/A3Z will notify the registrar and AETC/A3R of approved recalls.
   2.3.5. Disenrollment. Process all students who fail to progress according to AFI
   11402/AETC SUP.
2.4. Notification Procedures:
   2.4.1. Students Experiencing Difficulty. When a student requires an elimination check, is
   eliminated from or reinstated in training, the OG/CC, or as delegated, will notify
   AETC/A3ZS and:
      2.4.1.1. Active duty students' home/gaining units.
      2.4.1.2. ANG students' home units. Also for ANG students, notify AETC/A3G and
      NGB/A3O. Notify these same addressees when there is reasonable doubt about an ANG
      student’s potential to complete a training phase.
 12                                                        AETCI36-2205V8 30 APRIL 2013


       2.4.1.3. AFRC students' home units. Also for AFRC students, notify AETC/A3H and
       AFRC/A3T. Notify these same addressees when there is reasonable doubt about an
       AFRC student’s potential to complete a training phase.
   2.4.2. Graduation Change Notification. OG/CC will notify AETC/A3Z and the gaining
   unit when any student is more than 15 training days behind, or if it becomes apparent that a
   student will not graduate within 30 training days of the scheduled PFT graduation date.
   Provide reasons and an estimated graduation date. If the graduation date is changed (i.e. the
   student is rolled back to a later class), notify the gaining unit, AETC/A3ZS, AETC/A3RA
   (and NGB/A1DU or AFRC/A1MB, as appropriate) not later than 5 duty days after discovery.
   The OG/CC will coordinate any required follow-up action, such as assignment changes,
   follow-on training, port calls, amendments to orders, extended temporary duty (TDY)
   waivers, etc. If a student will be extended beyond the report no later than date (RNLTD),
   contact AFPC for procedures. AETC/A3 approval is required to roll back an entire class.
       2.4.2.1. TDY-to-School Program (Not Applicable to Students in Permanent Change
       of Station [PCS] Status). The OG/CC will notify AETC/FMAM of any student training
       delays of more than 7 calendar days that are because of wash backs, break in training
       (BIT), duty not including flying (DNIF), medical hold, administrative hold, disciplinary
       action or elimination. Orders must be amended for all delays over 7 calendar days.
       2.4.2.2. Administrative Hold. OG/CC will notify AETC/A3ZS of students whose
       training has been suspended more than 14 calendar days.
       2.4.2.3. TDY Waiver Requirement. The Secretary of the Air Force must approve
       waivers for students who will exceed 180 days in TDY status. AETC FTUs will submit
       180-day TDY waiver requests to AFPC/DPAPP, with an information copy to
       AETC/A3ZS.
       2.4.2.4. Student Rollback. Student rollbacks will not be used to manage PFT status.
2.5. Fitness Standards. Students in AETC FTUs will participate in scheduled physical training
according to AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program and AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1. TRS will schedule
fitness assessments during academic/simulator phase. Flying squadrons will schedule during
flight phase.
2.6. Student Scheduling. Do not schedule students to perform duties in excess of a 12-hour
flight duty period, or less if prescribed by AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules, or the
applicable AFI 11-2MDS-specific, Volume 3. Academic scheduling personnel will follow
guidelines in AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1.
   2.6.1. Training Continuity and Prerequisites. Schedule students to maintain a constant
   training flow, using the building block approach, according to the syllabus. Ensure students
   meet lesson prerequisites before being scheduled for sortie/lessons.
2.7. Distinguished Graduates (DG):
   2.7.1. Units with a DG program will recognize students who clearly excel during formal
   training. Formalize any DG programs in local supplements. DGs must demonstrate
   outstanding progress in each: academic, simulator, and flying training and outstanding
   results in flying and simulator evaluations. The unit commander is the final approval
   authority for all awards.
AETCI36-2205V8 30 APRIL 2013                                                                 13


   2.7.2. The OG/CC will develop his or her own method of identifying the top 10 percent of
   students as DGs per class. Classes with fewer than 10 students may have one DG. Fractions
   may be rounded up. Commanders may elect not to designate a DG in a class.
   2.7.3. DGs will be identified on AF IMT 475, Education/Training Report and receive AETC
   Form 499, Distinguished Graduate Certificate, or an approved local substitute, signed by the
   SQ/CC and DO.
   2.7.4. Students in the grade of E-8, E-9 or O-5 and above are ineligible for the DG program.
2.8. Student Administrative Control. Administrative control over students will be given to the
TRS/CC when a student is in academic/simulator training and the Flying Squadron/CC during
flightline training. For PCS students, the gaining commander will retain administrative control.

                                TRAINING MANAGEMENT

3.1. Training Folders:
   3.1.1. Each student will have a training folder that includes grade sheets and other
   documentation, as defined by the specific syllabus, AFI 11-2MDS-specific volumes, and
   local supplement to this instruction. Units will use Graduate Training Integration
   Management System [GTIMS], to fulfill this requirement. The unit’s training system dictates
   which forms are used in each training folder.
   3.1.2. Student training folders are for the exclusive use of the student’s instructors, flight
   commander, supervisors, and immediate chain of command. Students may only access their
   own training folders. Additional procedures may be specified in supplements to this
   instruction.
      3.1.2.1. Secure training folders (paper and electronic) and personal information folders to
      prevent unauthorized access. Information affecting student training that is inappropriate
      for public access or personally sensitive in nature shall be documented in the personnel
      information folder (PIF). Add a brief note in the grade folder indicating that additional
      information is in the PIF. The contractor approved to conduct formal training or maintain
      training records will keep training folders in a secure location.
      3.1.2.2. Record each aircraft, academic, and ground training event in the training folder.
   3.1.3. Units using AETC syllabi to accomplish Second Method Training(SMT) that don’t
   have access to GTIMS may use AETC Form 900, Individual Mission Grade Sheet; AETC
   Form 74, Aircrew Training Sortie Maneuver Grades; AETC Form 902, Student Activity
   Record and AETC Form 903/903P Unaccomplished Task/Milestone Regression Log.
3.2. Documenting Training:
   3.2.1. PIF. Maintain documents or training records not associated with or directly relevant
   to formal course aircrew training, that are inappropriate for public access or are sensitive in
   nature, in a PIF separate from the aircrew training folder. Protect and maintain the PIF in a
   secure location apart from aircrew training folders.
   3.2.2. Grading Guidance. Students will satisfactorily complete all syllabus-directed course
   training standards (CTS). Each syllabus includes the required proficiency level (RPL) that
   must be met for sortie/lesson progression.
      3.2.2.1. Maneuver Item File (MIF)/Task Proficiency Levels. Table 3.1 prescribes the
      proficiency levels for assigning grades to specific training tasks. Instructors assign grades
      on the student’s characteristic proficiency without regard to the student’s type and
      amount of training.
AETCI36-2205V8 30 APRIL 2013                                                                       15

     0                   Performance indicates a lack of ability or knowledge.
     1                   Can do tasks/understands topics only after being introduced, told or
                         shown. Can identify basic facts and state nomenclature/terms and/or
                         perform basic procedures involved in an activity with significant
                         assistance from an instructor.
     2                   Can do tasks/understand topics, but not to the desired levels of speed,
                         accuracy and safety. Can state/discuss facts and nomenclature/terms
                         and/or perform procedures and basic techniques involved in an activity
                         with some assistance from an instructor.
     3                   Can do tasks/understand topics, at the acceptable levels of speed,
                         accuracy and safety. Can analyze/state/describe facts/ principles and
                         nomenclature/terms and/or perform procedures and techniques
                         involved in an activity with no assistance from an instructor.
     4                   Can do all tasks/topics at the highest levels of speed, accuracy and
                         safety. Can evaluate/explain/describe facts/principles and
                         nomenclature/terms and/or perform procedures and create new
                         concepts/techniques involved in an activity.
     D (Dangerous) Performance was unsafe or showed dangerous tendencies. One element
                   marked “Dangerous” will require an overall grade of “Zero”.
     U (Unknown)         Performance was not observed or element was not performed
     I (See Note)        Introduction or familiarization training was conducted, but the
                         individual is not held responsible for task performance or knowledge.
     R (See Note)        Previously evaluated material was reviewed to ensure a desired level of
                         proficiency was maintained.
 Note: I and R grading scales should be kept to a minimum and are intended for key staff,
 senior officer courses, simulator and system refresher courses.
         3.2.2.2. Overall Grading. Table 3.2 describes the overall sortie/lesson grades. The
         overall grade represents the instructor’s subjective assessment of the student’s cumulative
         sortie/lesson performance measured against the task proficiency levels for each training
         sortie/lesson. Students are expected to progress as they advance in training. A student’s
         continued lack of progress should be reflected with an overall grade less than a 2. The
         syllabus-defined required proficiency level (RPL) must be met for sortie/lesson
         progression.

                       A                                              B
      Overall Status                        Definition
      Effective                             Sortie/lesson is effective if the student completes all
                                            required sortie/lesson training task(s) and
                                            achieves/maintains preprinted RPL.
      Effective/Incomplete                  A sortie/lesson is “Effective/Incomplete” if the
                                            student meets Sortie/lesson objectives but does not
                                            accomplish all asterisked training tasks/MIF.
                                            Missions will only be “Effective/Incomplete” if all
                                            unaccomplished tasks can be accomplished in a
                                            later sortie/lesson with no impact to training. The
                                            student will progress to the next sortie. Example:
                                            Early termination of the sortie due to weather or
                                            maintenance.
      Effective/Regression                  Sortie/lesson is effective/regression if the student
                                            accomplishes all training tasks/MIF, but fails to
                                            achieve/maintain preprinted RPL.
      Noneffective (NE)/Student             Sortie/lesson is NE/SNP if the student fails to clear
      Nonprogression (SNP)                  regression status, does not achieve required training
                                            task CTS on the last sortie/lesson in a phase, or is
                                            graded RPL “D” for any training task/MIF.
      Noneffective (NE)/Other               Sortie/lesson is NE/Other if the student does not
                                            accomplish required training tasks due to external
                                            factors. (Example: Failure to launch due to
                                            maintenance or weather.) The sortie/lesson is
                                            rescheduled; it will not count as an “X” sortie.

   3.2.3. Proficiency Advancement (PA). Students may advance past a single sortie/lesson to
   the next sortie/lesson or evaluation in a training category provided all RPLs are met or
   exceeded for the advanced (skipped) sortie/lesson. The SQ/DO or FLT/CC is the PA
   approval authority. To document, the instructor makes a narrative recommendation and the
   concurring official enters a narrative with a lesson grade PA. Document PA on the advanced
   (skipped) sortie/lesson in the student’s training folder. Note: PA may be used more than
   once. However, minimum events as defined in the syllabus may not be reduced with a PA
   grade.
3.2.4. Regression. After a student is required to demonstrate proficiency in training tasks as
required by the syllabus, proficiency must be maintained in those items. In the event that a
student’s performance regresses after proficiency is required by the syllabus, that mission should
be graded “Effective/Regression in Training” or “NE-SNP.” Regression training tasks must be
brought back to standards through additional ground instruction (ground instruction is defined as
classroom instruction, computer based instruction or “table talk” instruction), instruction on a
later syllabus sortie, or an ATD lesson. Overall Mission Status should be graded as follows:
 18                                                          AETCI36-2205V8 30 APRIL 2013


       3.2.4.1. Effective/Regression in Training – Grade used if the student’s performance is
       such that additional training is required to bring the student’s performance back to
       standards, but another sortie/lesson of the same type is not required. If the task must be
       performed on a sortie/lesson, the student’s regression item must be brought back to
       standards on the next sortie/lesson where performance can be demonstrated without
       degradation to the sortie/lesson profile. If the student again fails performance standards
       (double regression), he must then be graded NE/SNP and scheduled for an X-ride.
       3.2.4.2. NE-SNP – Grade used if, in the judgment of the instructor, another sortie/lesson
       must be dedicated to bring the student’s performance up to standards, or if the
       sortie/lesson was not flown due to substandard mission preparation or ground operations.
       Document the remedial instruction, clearing the regression, in the student’s grade book.
       3.2.4.3. If a student regresses on the same task multiple times, squadron supervisors will
       assess the student’s progress and determine the appropriate course of action.
   3.2.5. Additional Training (AT). Non-graded additional training sorties/lessons will result
   from Break in Training (BIT) or Direct Support Sorties. Both BIT and direct support
   sorties/lessons will be indicated by an ADD – Number sortie/lesson and receive an Over All
   Grade of - No Grade (NG). Graded additional training sorties/lessons will result from student
   nonprogression. These graded additional training sorties/lessons will be indicated as an X
   sortie/lesson, denoted by an X number suffix after the sortie designation (i.e., NT-2-X1, NT-
   2-X2, etc).
   3.2.5.1. Break in Training (BIT). The SQ/DO may authorize an ADD sortie/lesson due to
   extended training delays. ADD sorties will be used to ensure training continuity only due to
   breaks in training. They will not be used to provide additional training due to student
   deficiencies. As a guide, consider 7 calendar days, but no more than 14 days without an
   aircraft sortie or ATD lesson as an extended break. All AT will be documented in the
   student’s training folder. The student will repeat the last sortie/lesson accomplished. .
   Additionally, the OG/CC may authorize additional sorties prior to the student reflying the last
   sortie profile. Identify the repeated sortie as an “ADD” sortie (e.g., TFTA2-ADD). This
   sortie will not be designated as an “X” sortie (3.2.5.4.), will not require proficiency, and will
   result in an overall grade of “NG.”
EXAMPLE: Student flew TFTA-2 on 1 March. The student then experienced a break in training
greater than 14 calendar days. The student must refly the TFTA-2 profile, designated TFTA-
ADD, prior to resuming formal flying training. However, based upon the length of the break, the
OG/CC may authorize a NLL and an additional TFTA sortie (e.g., NLL-ADD, TFTA-ADD).
The student will complete these two sorties prior to accomplishing TFTA-ADD (TFTA-2
profile).
If an ADD sortie is needed after a recommendation for evaluation, the sortie will include all
recommended criteria according to the syllabus and another operations review will be
accomplished before the flight evaluation. Include BIT ADD sorties time in student total training
time.
       3.2.5.2. Direct Support Sorties/Lessons. Direct support sorties/lessons are authorized
       to support another student's syllabus-directed training requirements in a multi-place
       aircraft/ATD, or as part of a formation. Performed under instructor supervision, students
AETCI36-2205V8 30 APRIL 2013                                                                 19


     may perform direct support aircrew duties in events or missions they have already been
     trained for, which would otherwise require another qualified aircrew member. As these
     sorties/lessons are not dedicated to training the supporting student to meet syllabus CTS,
     do not include the direct support time in the supporting student’s grade book, enter 0.0
     hours. Instructors will enter an ADD-number sortie/lesson narrative to describe the
     mission and annotate the student’s primary/secondary/total flight time. ADD sorties will
     be graded: no-grade (NG) overall.
     3.2.5.3. ADD-Number Sorties/Lessons. Flying hours used to accomplish ADD-number
     sorties must fall within a unit's normally allocated flying hour program; no additional
     hours will be allocated to make up for hours used to accomplish ADD-number sorties.
     All ADD-number sorties require a write-up and are numbered sequentially within the
     course. ADD-number sorties may never be used to augment a student’s training after the
     student is entered into the Commander’s Review (CR) process.
     3.2.5.4. X Sorties/Lessons. An X sortie/lesson (for student nonprogression, Over All
     Grade of: 0; Student Nonprogression) is used to document graded additional training
     sorties/lessons beyond syllabus requirements in order to provide remedial training to
     bring student proficiency up to RPL. The SQ/CC and/or the OG/CC may authorize X
     sortie/lessons and additional ground instruction (ground instruction is defined as
     classroom instruction, computer based instruction or “table talk” instruction). The
     FLT/CC and/or the TRS equivalent may only authorize additional ground instruction. If
     additional ground instruction is necessary to correct deficiencies before the X
     sortie/lesson is preformed, document that training on the X sortie/lesson in the student’s
     training folder.
     3.2.5.5. Total Allowable X Sorties/Lessons. Total allowable X sorties/lessons will be
     documented in each AETC syllabus and will be calculated/accounted for separately -
     both flight sorties and for ground based aircrew training device (ATD) lessons. Total
     allowable X sorties/lessons until documented in the syllabus will be set at 15 percent or 2
     (whichever is greater) above syllabus directed training requirements. Note: Areas that
     calculate to a whole number and a decimal will be rounded to the next higher number
     (e.g., 1.4 would be set at a maximum of two (2)). X sorties/lessons may be allocated
     evenly between the SQ/CC and OG/CC. No matter how they are allocated, the SQ/CC
     will notify the OG/CC once a student exceeds 50% of the Total Allowable X
     sorites/lessons. Once a student has exceeded the number of training flights and/or total
     allowable X sorties/lessons directed by the syllabus commanders should consider
     eliminating the student according to AFI 11-402.
  3.2.6. Independent Lesson. Each training lesson is considered independent. When
  completing more than one lesson on the same mission/sortie, complete the grade folder for
  each lesson separately. For time calculations, enter the training time used to complete that
  specific lesson. The total of the training times for both lessons will not exceed the total
  mission/sortie time. Note: Instructors will complete aircrew training folder entries even if a
  sortie is cancelled before mission brief. Publish detailed grade book/folder and/or TMS
  electronic grade book/folder (software) instructions and guidance in a supplement to this
  instruction.
  3.2.7. Other Documentation.

       3.2.7.1. AETC Form 6, Waiver Request. Use to request prerequisite waivers, syllabus
       execution waivers and course overages. Copies of approved waivers will be kept in the
       student’s training folder.
       3.2.7.2. AF Form 101, Reserve Requirements for School Tours of Active Duty for
       Training. If applicable, units prepare this form to record and monitor student
       deficiencies during the course of training. Keep the form in the student’s training folder.
       Specify documented military deficiencies, including unexcused tardiness or absences;
       traffic tickets; fitness program violations; and dress and appearance violations, per AFI
       36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel.
       3.2.7.3. AF IMT 174, Record of Individual Counseling. Document all sessions
       concerning sensitive personnel issues on AF IMT 174, and maintain them separately in
       the PIF. Sensitive student information will not be kept in GTIMS.
3.3. Disposition of Student Training Records. Registrars will maintain student training
records according to Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Include all grade sheets, student
activity records, and additional grade book forms and logs. FTUs will securely forward all grade
book/folder documentation to the student’s gaining MAJCOM A3T or equivalent, the follow-on
training unit (as applicable), and optionally directly to the student’s gaining unit, within 15 duty
days of class graduation. Securely forward personal information files (PIF), directly to the
student’s gaining unit commander.
3.4. Training Folder Management/Closeout Procedures. Periodic review of training folders
will be performed. Training Folders will be closed out. Units will develop local procedures on
training folder review and closeout procedures.
AETCI36-2205V8 30 APRIL 2013                                                                       21


                                           Chapter 4

                                STUDENT MANAGEMENT

4.1. Commander’s Awareness Program (CAP):
   4.1.1. Objective. To focus supervisory attention on a student’s training progress, specific
   deficiencies, and potential to complete the program. CAP may also be used to monitor
   personal issues requiring supervisory attention. CAP is intended as a short-term program
   (one to two weeks). A student requiring an extended period of increased supervision or
   repeated placement on CAP based on performance should be considered for an elimination
   check (EC). NOTE: CAP is not part of the Commander’s Review (CR) process. CAP does
   not apply to courses of 7 training days or less.
   4.1.2. CAP Category Types. CAP is divided into categories that encompass student flying,
   procedural, and academic concerns, airsickness, military conduct and other matters. See
   Table 4.1 for category descriptions.

Table 4.1. CAP Category.
Flying            An event or issue that affects the flying phase of training.
Procedural        An event or issue that affects substandard general or emergency procedure
                  knowledge.
Academic          An event or issue that affects academic training.
Airsickness       An event or issue in the area of airsickness and/or physiological incident.
Military          An event or issue in the area of Air Force core values, military standards and
                  discipline, etc.
Other             An event or issue that does not fit into the other categories (personal, etc.)
                  This category should also be used when students are waiting for waiver
                  resolution to ensure they do not fly until waivers are approved.

4.2. SQ/CC Responsibilities. For TDY students during academic or simulator training, the
TRS/CC administers the program. While the TDY student is in flight line training, the flying
SQ/CC administers the program. For PCS students the gaining SQ/CC administers CAP. Note:
CAP administration may be delegated to the SQ/DO, FLT/CC, or designated supervisor, but the
SQ/CC maintains overall authority and responsibility.
4.3. CAP Procedures:
   4.3.1. Placement. The FLT/CC, SQ/DO, SQ/CC, or designated supervisor places a student
   on CAP when substandard performance, personal issues, or lost training requires close
   monitoring of individual progress. The initiating individual will counsel students placed on
   CAP. Initial counseling will address the reason for CAP placement, CAP objectives, student
   training plan, instructor continuity, and CAP removal goals. The FLT/CC or aircrew training
   system (ATS) lead instructor will review the student’s training folder and place the student
   on CAP for substandard performance as the result of the following: exam failure; first aircraft
   sortie or aircrew training device (ATD) lesson with an overall grade of 0; consecutive aircraft
 22                                                          AETCI36-2205V8 30 APRIL 2013


   sorties or ATD lessons with an overall grade of 1; or failure to attain RPL for ground
   training. (Note: Consecutive is defined as a repeat of an event in the same phase or first
   attempt on any successive phase.)
   4.3.2. CAP Student Activities. While students are in CAP, the unit will:
       4.3.2.1. Tailor training to address the student’s particular situation within the limits of
       the syllabus.
       4.3.2.2. Closely monitor instructor continuity.
       4.3.2.3. Not compromise proficiency levels to permit CAP students to progress in
       training.
       4.3.2.4. Provide additional counseling as required. Additional counseling is done at the
       discretion of immediate supervisors, but is required if students fail to meet the CAP
       removal goals.
       4.3.2.5. Appropriately update any intermediate goals and CAP removal goals.
       4.3.2.6. Regularly brief squadron leaders on a student’s progress toward CAP removal.
       This briefing should include student strong and weak areas and CAP removal criteria.
       4.3.2.7. Maintain documentation of all counseling in the student’s training record. Note:
       Document sessions concerning sensitive personal problems on AF IMT 174, and retain in
       a separate PIF maintained by the supervisor. (See paragraph 3.2.1.)
   4.3.3. CAP Removal. SQ/CC will be briefed prior to removing a student from CAP so the
   SQ/CC is aware of everyone who is removed from CAP. Removing a student from CAP is
   based on when the student meets CAP removal goals, demonstrates sustained normal
   progress, or resolves personal issues. Removal should not be strictly event/task/sortie/lesson
   based, particularly when individual weak areas can carry over into the next phase or module.
   Immediate supervisors will counsel students when they are removed from CAP.
4.4. Elimination Check (EC). Unit commanders use the EC to assess a student’s overall flying
skills and potential to meet syllabus and MAJCOM requirements. SQ/CCs should consider an
EC for sustained substandard performance or doubtful potential to complete formal training.
Notify the OG/CC when an EC is scheduled. ECs are not intended to comply with AFI 11202,
Volume 2, requirements, but to assess the student’s ability to accept instruction and potential for
course completion. Only AF evaluators designated by the SQ/CC will fly ECs.
   4.4.1. The overall mission grade for an EC will be 3,; 2,; or 0,. Students are allowed to repeat
   maneuvers and may be instructed in all areas. In all cases, unsatisfactory tasks that
   precipitated the EC will be sampled. An EC for procedural knowledge will consist of a
   ground evaluation and may include a simulator mission. The EC will be documented in the
   student’s training folder. Use EC01, as applicable, for the mission number.
   4.4.2. A satisfactory EC fulfills the requirements of the lesson/sortie that caused it to be
   accomplished, and allows the student to continue training in the normal training syllabus
   flow at the next syllabus lesson/sortie. This check does not fulfill the requirements of an AFI
   11202, Volume 2, evaluation.
   4.4.3. An unsatisfactory EC will result in entry into the OG/CC Review under the CR
   process.
AETCI36-2205V8 30 APRIL 2013                                                                   23


       4.4.3.1. ATD EC. SQ/CCs may direct ATD ECs any time student performance warrants
       consideration for elimination. A properly trained Air Force or contract instructor will
       “operate” the device for the ATD ECs, and at the same time, an Air Force evaluator
       designated by the SQ/CC will conduct the briefing, ATD evaluation
       execution/observation, debriefing, and assign the overall grade. The student will meet
       task proficiency levels to continue training. All ATD sorties must be coordinated with the
       ATS contractor.
       4.4.3.2. Ground Evaluation EC. EC ground evaluations may be conducted as a result
       of unsatisfactory general knowledge or emergency procedures knowledge, or for failure
       to meet syllabus standards in procedural knowledge. In all cases, the Air Force evaluator
       will conduct the briefing, ground evaluation execution, and debriefing, and assign the
       overall grade.
       4.4.3.3. Incomplete EC. An EC is incomplete only if mission tasks/events and
       objectives could not be completed, and a reasonable evaluation of student performance
       could not be made. If an aircraft EC was incomplete for only nonflying, or ground items
       that same Air Force evaluator must complete the EC.
4.5. Commander’s Review (CR) Process and Responsibilities. (Note: CR is not applicable to
simulator/system refresher courses). This process determines whether to continue, modify, or
terminate training. Each syllabus is unique, which may require different review criteria and
procedures. However, use the following guidance unless otherwise directed:
   4.5.1. General. The CR process attempts to resolve training deficiencies at the lowest
   practical level and ensure significant substandard performance is brought to leadership’s
   attention. CRs will include a review of the student’s training folder; an interview with the
   student; and interviews with instructors, military training leaders, and supervisors (when
   appropriate). Document all CRs in the student’s training folder, or the electronic media
   equivalent. The intent is to allow students to continue in training until their ability to
   complete the course comes into question. See Attachment 2 for process chart.
   4.5.2. Triggers. The student’s SQ/CC will review the student’s training for these reasons:
   Commander’s review recommendation by FLT/CC or ATS lead instructor as a result of
   requiring X sorties/lessons or an elimination recommendation; second exam failures; second
   aircraft sortie or ATD lesson with an Over All Grade of 0; recurring failure to attain ground
   training RPL; an AFI 11202, Volume 2, evaluation failure. (Note: Exams include phase tests,
   end of course tests, and required flight evaluation requisite exams). The SQ/CC may:
   authorize X sorties/device lessons according to the syllabus; authorize additional ground
   training; direct an Elimination Check (EC); recommend elimination. During contractor-
   provided training, the TRS/CC conducts the review. While a student is in flight line training,
   the flying SQ/CC conducts the review.
The OG/CC will review the student’s training records when recommended by the SQ/CC. The
intent is to raise the level of review when excessive resources are expended to meet training
goals, regardless of the cause. Exception: This does not include sorties/simulators preformed for
direct support or to regain proficiency lost during BIT, or EC. The OG/CC may authorize X
sorties/device lessons according to the syllabus; deny X sorties/device lessons; or request a
AETC/A3Z waiver for additional X sorties/device lessons above the course limit. Note: The
OG/CC may reinstate a student a second time with AETC/A3Z waiver approval for additional X
 24                                                            AETCI36-2205V8 30 APRIL 2013


sorties/device lessons above the course limit. If the student subsequently fails during prescribed
X sorties/device lessons the SQ/CC will recommend elimination.
When students demonstrate a lack of potential to meet training standards, the SQ/CC will
recommend elimination. Use AETC Form 126G to document the CR process. Complete the CR
process within 20 duty days (24 duty days for international students) from the date the initiating
authority signs AETC Form 126G. See Attachment 3 for Sample Student Notification
Memorandum. See Attachment 4 for Briefing Guide and checklist for the CR process.
   4.5.3. Initiating Authority (IA). The student’s SQ/CC is the initiating authority. The IA
   will:
         4.5.3.1. Inform the student that the CR process is being initiated and state reasons for the
         action.
         4.5.3.2. Explain the CR process to the student.
         4.5.3.3. Remove the student from training pending the approving authority’s (AA)
         decision. Note: The initiating authority may elect to continue the student in academics-
         only training with reviewing authority (RA) concurrence.
         4.5.3.4. Notify the HARM office to suspend the student’s aeronautical orders according
         to AFI 11402/AETC Sup.
         4.5.3.5. Notify the student in writing of consideration for elimination (Attachment 3).
         4.5.3.6. Inform the student of individual rights for legal assistance and representation.
         4.5.3.7. Advise the student to submit a letter within 2 duty days identifying any factors
         that may have affected training.
         4.5.3.8. Complete AETC Form 126G, Section I and clearly state the reason(s). Indicate
         whether the student is an Initial CEA or a Qualified CEA. Complete Section V with
         applicable information.
         4.5.3.9. Ensure the student completes AETC Form 126G, Section II.
         4.5.3.10. Forward the completed AETC Form 126G with the student’s memorandum,
         training record, any attachments and written documentation (if applicable) to the
         reviewing authority no later than 4 duty days after notifying the student.
      4.5.4. Reviewing Authority (RA). The OG/CC is the reviewing authority. The RA will:
         4.5.4.1. Review the student’s training and determine if any training irregularity would
         warrant retention in training. (Note: The OG/CC may delegate this review and
         recommendation authority to the deputy OG/CC). The reviewing authority will discuss
         the circumstances of the elimination with the initiating authority. The reviewing authority
         may interview the student, as necessary.
         4.5.4.2. Complete AETC Form 126G, Section III, including comments (when applicable)
         regarding the student’s retention or elimination from training. Also complete Section IV,
         if applicable, including all evaluation results by lesson/sortie and overall grade.
         4.5.4.3. For medical eliminations, provide a statement evaluating the student’s ability to
         complete training if medically requalified.

       4.5.4.4. Forward the AETC Form 126G with all applicable records to the AA for final
       review.
   4.5.5. Approving Authority (AA). The WG/CC is the approving authority. The AA will:
       4.5.5.1. Review the student’s records and reviewing authority's comments.
       4.5.5.2. Decide whether the student will be reinstated or eliminated from training.
       4.5.5.3. For Initial CEA students - marking the “eliminate” block indicates the final
       decision on elimination and the student is permanently removed from the course.
           4.5.5.3.1. Complete Section V of AETC Form 126G, annotating any
           recommendations of follow-on training for the student. The AA may also recommend
           lateral flow of enlisted initial CEA students to other aircraft or crew positions. The
           WG/CC ensures coordination of lateral training requirements through AETC/A3Z.
           Note: Do not recommend students eliminated for manifestation of apprehension
           (MOA) for any other flying training.
           4.5.5.3.2. Upon elimination, inform the student of the opportunity to indicate
           personal desires for retention in service and future training according to AFI 36-2110,
           Assignments. Explain the possibility of reassignment action or release from extended
           active duty under the separation policies.
       4.5.5.4. For rated officer or Qualified CEA students, marking the “eliminate” block
       requires initiation of a flying evaluation board (FEB), according to AFI 11402/AETC
       Sup.
4.6. CR Records Distribution. Distribute copies of CR records on eliminated students within
10 duty days of completion of the CR process. The originating base registrar office will maintain
the original CR record.
   4.6.1. Send a copy of the completed AETC Form 126G to the office performing course
   registrar duties and HARM office. The course registrar will ensure AETC/A3RA is informed
   of every elimination from training so the MilPDS system can be updated with an elimination
   code.
   4.6.2. The HARM office will update the aviation resource management system (ARMS)
   with the appropriate disqualification code according to AFI 11-402/AETC SUP.
   4.6.3. Table 4.2 provides guidance on distribution of officer and qualified CEA CR Records.
   Table 4.3 provides guidance on distribution of Initial CEA CR records. Maintain these
   records according to Air Force RDS.

       waiver.
       4.7.3.4. Experience difficulties in an instructor upgrade course where the problem
       specifically concerns the student’s lack of instructional ability rather than a lack of
       proficiency. Accomplish AETC Form 125C IAW AFI-11-402 AETC Sup 1.
4.8. Student Disposition:
   4.8.1. Students reinstated after academic deficiencies will repeat the applicable examination
   after appropriate additional training.
   4.8.2. After completing Section IV of AETC Form126G, process eliminated students under

                       MEDICAL MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS

5.1. General. This chapter establishes student management requirements for appropriate
medical and operations personnel. Operations and medical personnel will ensure SQ/CCs are
informed when students exhibit MOA symptoms or other medical conditions that affect student
decisions. Supervisors must also strive to keep students motivated and flying on a regular basis.
5.1.1. Publications that Provide Medical Guidance. AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1 provides the
definition of airsickness. This regulation also discusses management of a student who is airsick.
AFI 11-402 addresses if a student is unable to meet training standards along with airsickness and
how it relates to an FEB.
5.2. Airsickness. Instructors will document in the student’s training folder when a student
experiences any form of airsickness. Comply with AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1. If airsickness
leads to significant deviation from training profile or prevents the student from meeting MIF
requirements, the student will be referred to the FS for evaluation according to AFI 48-123. This
will be accomplished prior to the next flight. If the student is off station and no flight surgeon is
available, verbal approval will be obtained from a flight surgeon before the student flies the next
sortie. The student will report to the flight surgeon for evaluation upon return to home station
and will not fly again until cleared by a flight surgeon. AFI 48-123 allows for AETCI 48-102 to
be used for airsickness guidance for undergraduate/graduate flight training; both officer and
enlisted.
5.3. Visually Induced Motion Sickness (VIMS). If VIMS is so severe that no simulator
training can be accomplished, refer the student to the FS for evaluation of alternatives. Because
VIMS is usually unrelated to airsickness, do not consider students for elimination based solely
on VIMS episodes.
5.4. Manifestation of Apprehension (MOA). Instructors will document the student’s training
folder when a student experiences MOA. Refer to AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1, for guidance
concerning MOA issues.
5.5. Administrative Hold Status. Refer to AETCI 48-102 for initial CEAs and AETCI 36-
2205 Volume 1 for officers and qualified/previously qualified CEA guidance.
5.6. Medical Hold. Refer to AETCI 36-2205 Volume 1, AETCI 48-102, and AFI 41-210 for
medical hold guidance.
5.7. Administrative Requirements for Flying Training Supervisors and Flight Surgeons:
   5.7.1. FSs will provide flying training supervisors a list of flying restrictions for each student
   entering training. Flying training supervisors will forward these restrictions to gaining units.
   5.7.2. An instructor or squadron supervisor may direct a student to visit the FS, or a student
   may self-initiate the visit.
   5.7.3. Every visit to the FS or physiology training officer (PTO) will be documented. For
   directed visits, the student hand carries the documentation to the FS or PTO. The FS reviews
   documentation, annotates any recommended flying restrictions, and dates and signs the
   documentation. The student will return the documentation to the FLT/CC for inclusion in the
30                                                       AETCI36-2205V8 30 APRIL 2013


  training record. If the student initiates the visit, the FS or PTO will provide the
  documentation to the student, who will return it to the FLT/CC.
  5.7.4. If a student’s DNIF status changes, the FS’s office will inform the student’s flying
  squadron of this either by telephone conference or via a copy of AF IMT 1042, Medical
  Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty (or another Service’s equivalent).
  Simulation training during DNIF status may be acceptable, and the FS should address this on
  AF IMT 1042. The appropriate supervisor will approve dental and FS examinations (other
  than sick call and emergencies) before scheduling a dental or FS appointment. (AF IMT 1042
  is prescribed in AFI 48-123, Volume 3. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out
  the form.)
