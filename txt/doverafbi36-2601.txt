                                             Chapter 1

                                          PERSONNEL

1.1. Off-Duty Employment
     1.1.1. Active duty military members participate in a wide variety of interest outside of their
     military duties, including off-duty employment and business ventures. These types of
     activities require prior approval from a member’s supervisor and unit commander. See DOD
     5500 7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation, Section 2-206a. Prior approval is required to ensure the
     off-duty activity does not interfere with government duties, bring discredit upon the Air
     Force, endanger the member’s safety or health, or otherwise appear to involve a conflict of
     interest.
     1.1.2. All Dover AFB active duty military members are required to submit an AF IMT Form
     3902, Application and Approval for Off-Duty Employment, through their supervisor to obtain
     prior approval for any off-duty employment or business venture. Those members currently
     engaged in these activities who have not previously received written approval are also
     required to submit an AF IMT Form 3902.
1.2. Official Local Travel
     1.2.1. Chapter 2 of the Joint Federal Travel Regulation Part L: Local Travel in and around
     permanent duty station or temporary duty location establishes policy for military members.
     Paragraph U2800 B.2 states: “For DOD, the installation/base/senior commander establishes
     the local area for all DoD personnel, even if the personnel are from more than one command,
     unit, installation, or component.” Therefore all personnel who must travel outside the
     following US Postal ZIP codes are authorized travel entitlements. This policy applies to
     official local travel only and does not apply to any leave status.

        1.2.1.4. 21912, 13, 30
1.3. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
     1.3.1. The use of the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process allows an alternative to
     time consuming, expensive, legal compliance actions and provides faster, less expensive, and
     more productive results in eliminating workplace disputes. The ADR process has proven to
     be highly effective in resolving disputes fairly and quickly as it provides the capability for
     individuals involved in a dispute to come together, in a non-adversarial way, to explore
     solutions to conflict.
     1.3.2. The 436 AW is committed to maximizing the use of ADR. Although ADR may not
     apply to every workplace dispute, it is a viable alternative for a majority of them.
     Commanders, supervisors, and managers at all echelons are encouraged to implement the use
     of ADR, where appropriate, to help resolve workplace disputes in order to maintain a
DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                    5


   productive work environment. Similarly, employees are encouraged to use ADR as a
   corollary to using traditional resolution methods. Working together, impediments to full and
   sustained productivity can be overcome and improve cooperative working relationships.
   Refer to AFI 51-1201, Alternative Dispute Resolution Processes In Workplace Disputes.
1.4. Congressional Inquiries (CIs)
   1.4.1. Air Force policy is to respond promptly and factually to requests for information from
   members of Congress and their staffs. The 436 AW/CC assigned the 436 AW/IG as the OPR
   for all inquiries (verbal or written). Any CI received from anyone or any entity other than the
   436 AW/IG will be immediately forwarded to the 436 AW/IG for proper coordination and
   processing. The 436 AW/IG will inform SAF/LLI (Legislative Liaison), assign an OCR, and
   establish a suspense date for the draft response if applicable. The 436 AW/IG will forward
   the draft response to SAF/LLI after 436 AW/CC or CV coordination and approval. 436 AW
   personnel will not forward any draft response (verbal or written) directly to members of
   Congress or their staffs.
1.5. Supervisor Responsibilities Associated with Alcohol Use by Employees
   1.5.1. Supervisors and managers of civilian employees are responsible for being aware of the
   behavior and conduct of their employees. Concern and involvement are important for the
   safety and well-being of Team Dover’s workforce and for the security of the installation.
   Supervisors must be alert for signs of alcohol use and ensure that employees are not impaired
   while at work. This is especially critical in industrial shops and aircraft maintenance
   organizations and on the flight line where a single mistake could result in costly mishaps,
   loss of aircraft, injury or death. Supervisors are as accountable for employee mishaps due to
   alcohol-impaired judgment as for employee injuries resulting from failure to follow safety
   rules, practices and technical data.
      1.5.1.1. Supervisors must know their workers and take immediate, appropriate, and
      corrective action whenever there is negative employee behavior. Signs indicating an
      employee is impaired and unable to work might be slurred speech, red eyes, failure to
      concentrate, sleepiness, instability on one's feet, overly talkative/quiet, flushed
      appearance, frequent trips to the restroom and water fountain, tardiness, etc. These,
      coupled with the odor of an alcoholic beverage, must never be ignored. Encourage co-
      workers to be on the lookout for these signs in others. The standard is to ensure a zero
      likelihood that an alcohol-impaired employee would report to work at the beginning of a
      shift or after a meal. Ensure this standard is upheld. Please refer questions to the
      Civilian Personnel Section.
1.6. Active Duty Urinalysis Testing
   1.6.1. The random urinalysis inspection program provides that service members be randomly
   selected for urinalysis testing and ordered to report to the testing facility to provide a sample.
   The primary purpose of this testing is to determine and ensure the security, military fitness,
   and/or good order and discipline of the wing. It is also directed to determine and to ensure
   that the command is functioning properly, maintaining proper standards of readiness, and that
   personnel are present, fit, and ready for duty. These procedures are instituted IAW M.R.E.
   313; US. v. Patterson, 39 M.J. 678 (N.M.C.M.R. 1993); U.S. v. Danskam, 31 M.J. 77
 6                                                        DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014


     (C.M.A. 1990); US. v. Bickel, 30 M.J. 277 (C.M.A. 1990); U. S. v. Moeller, 30 M.J. 676
     (A.F.C.M.R. 1990); and other appellate court decisions.
     1.6.2. All members within the 436 AW who meet one or more of the criteria below will be
     required to submit to urinalysis testing as an "inspection" test. This is not to be confused
     with a “commander-directed urinalysis”. The following members will be tested:
        1.6.2.1. Personnel who have been randomly selected for urinalysis testing whose urine
        tests are reported by the drug testing laboratory as being positive for the presence of any
        illegal or unprescribed drug.
        1.6.2.2. Personnel who have been randomly selected for urinalysis testing whose urine
        sample is determined to be “untestable” by the drug testing laboratory, or due to it not
        being received by the drug testing laboratory (e.g., lost, destroyed, etc.).
        1.6.2.3. Personnel who are absent without leave for more than 8 hours.
     1.6.3. Under the conditions noted above, the member will be ordered to undergo another
     urine test on the next available testing date after the Drug Demand Reduction Program
     Manager (or designee) receives the urinalysis test report for the initial test. If the member is
     on leave, TDY, crew rest, or otherwise unavailable for testing at the time the original test
     report is received, he or she will be ordered to report for testing at the first testing opportunity
     upon his/her return. The subsequent test is considered to be a continuation of the original
     inspection. If the subsequent test results fall within the parameters as noted above, the test
     will be repeated until such time as a negative result is received from the testing facility. All
     such retests are considered part of the original random inspection.
1.7. Intramural Sports Program Participation
     1.7.1. IAW AFI 34-266, Air Force Fitness and Sports Programs, the 436 AW/CC has
     enacted the following policies for intramural participation.
        1.7.1.1. Active duty members, full time guardsman and reservists assigned to base units,
        adult family members, and Department of Defense (DoD) civilians, including NAF
        employees, may participate with their unit of assignment.
        1.7.1.2. DoD base contractor personnel, working full time on the installation and issued a
        common access card, are eligible to participate; however, they must play with the
        squadron within which their duties lie.
        1.7.1.3. Active duty military personnel assigned to base units always have first priority in
        intramural sports participation. Active duty military personnel cannot be denied
        participation in lieu of other categories of customers listed above.
1.8. Civilian Employee Participation in Physical Activities
     1.8.1. The Wing Commander has determined that health, wellness, and fitness activities
     meet the intent of AFI 36-815, Absence and Leave, Chapter 8. Supervisors may authorize
     excused absences for these kinds of activities for employee participation during duty hours
     without charge to the employee’s leave or loss of pay. Participation in such activities is not
     an entitlement. Supervisors must only allow participation when it will not adversely affect

   1.8.2. Civilian participation in physical fitness activities requires prior consent of the
   employee’s primary care practitioner/doctor, and prior approval of the employee’s second-
   level supervisor. This helps protect the Air Force against injury claims or harm to an
   employee whose health limits physical exertion. The Civilian Personnel Section EIM site
   identifies the specific rules of engagement and employee Memorandum of Understanding.
   Questions or issues not specifically defined in this instruction or on the EIM site should be
   discussed with a Civilian Personnel Section representative.
1.9. Priority Placement Program (PPP)
   1.9.1. It is Department of Defense (DoD) policy to minimize the adverse effects on
   employees displaced by actions such as, but not limited to, reductions-in-force, base closures,
   realignments, consolidations, contracting out, position classification decisions, rotation from
   overseas, and transfers of function. The PPP is the primary means for implementing this
   policy throughout DoD. The PPP is an effective outplacement source used to make every
   effort to assure continued employment for displaced employees.
   1.9.2. The PPP consists of several components, including the DoD Military Spouse
   Preference Program and the Reserve Component Military Technician Placement Program.
   The AF Human Resources community is responsible for administering the PPP and
   informing commanders, selecting officials or key managers of a potential placement for a
   displaced employee.
   1.9.3. The 436 AW/CC supports the DoD PPP and expects all organizations to be equally
   committed and willing to accept qualified employees that have been displaced through no
   fault of their own. The local Civilian Personnel Section can be contacted with any questions.
1.10. Civilian Over Hire
   1.10.1. The number of personnel the 436th Airlift Wing requires to accomplish its global
   mission must sometimes be augmented with civilian over hires.                 Requests and
   approval/disapproval for, as well as extensions of, civilian over hires will be documented
   using the Over Hire Request Worksheet, which can be found on the Civilian Personnel
   Section EIM site.
   1.10.2. The Civilian Employment and Cost Management Committee (CECMC) will approve
   or disapprove requests using wing funds. Group Commanders and the Wing Director of
   Staff will approve or disapprove requests using reimbursable funds and will subsequently
   brief the CECMC.
   1.10.3. Please refer questions to the Civilian Personnel Section, the Financial Management
   Office, or the Manpower Office.
1.11. Civilian Premium Pay (Overtime, Compensatory Time)
   1.11.1. The Civilian Personnel Section EIM site identifies the approving authority and
   provides the rules to follow by requesting officials, resource managers, and time keepers.
   Squadron commanders are responsible for completing the Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay
   and Compensatory Time Self-Inspection Checklist quarterly to ensure compliance with AFI
   36-802. Information concerning compensatory time off for travel is also available on the
   Civilian Personnel Section EIM site. Questions about this policy or issues not specifically
   defined should be discussed with a representative of the Civilian Personnel Section.

      Promotion/Demotion Program, establishes written selection procedures that ensure the
      SrA BTZ program is fair, equitable, and provides timely promotion consideration.
      1.14.1.2. The 436th Force Support Squadron/Military Personnel Section Career
      Development Element (436 FSS/FSMPD) is responsible for set up and implementation of
      the SrA BTZ Central Registry Board (CBB). The CBB is for small units with fewer than
      seven Airman First Class (A1C) eligible for the specified quarter.
      1.14.1.3. Squadron Commanders of large units (with seven or more eligible A1Cs) are
      responsible for selection of nominees from their units. Large unit selection procedures
      will mirror the CBB selection procedures.
   1.14.2. Program Objectives
      1.14.2.1. The purpose for BTZ promotion is to provide exceptional A1Cs a one-time
      consideration for early promotion to SrA. Airmen selected for SrA BTZ should be those
      who have clearly demonstrated the potential for advancement and increased
      responsibility and are ready to move on to the next higher grade. Promotion will be
      effective six months prior to the fixed fully qualified phase point. Selection opportunity
      is 15 percent of the total time-in-grade (TIG) and time-in-service (TIS) eligible
      population of A1Cs.
      1.14.2.2. Timelines:
          1.14.2.2.1. A1Cs must meet the requirements in AFI 36-2502, Table 2.1., and have
          36 months TIS and 20 months TIG, or 28 months TIG, whichever occurs first. Their
          commander must also recommend them. EXCEPTION: PAFSC skill level waivers
          are authorized in accordance with AFI 36-2502, Table 2.3. Combat Controller (CCT
          1C2X1) and Para Rescue (PJ 1T2X1) 6 year enlistees are eligible for SrA BTZ
          consideration.

OCT/NOV                               DEC                          JAN-MAR

      1.14.2.3. 436 FSS/FSMPD will:
          1.14.2.3.1. Identify eligible: Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) via the MPS,
          Personnel Systems Management, provides an automatic quarterly end of month
          (EOM) output product to the MPS, Career Development Element, within the first 10
          days of the first processing month (i.e., Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct). The roster identifies all
          A1Cs who meet or exceed the TIS and TIG requirements, regardless of promotion
          ineligibility conditions (e.g., on the control roster, PAFSC skill level too low,
          undergoing Article 15 suspended reduction, etc.). The output product produces an
          MPS alphabetical listing and a three-part unit listing.
          1.14.2.3.2. Verify Eligibility: MPS Career Development Element will only verify
          the TIG and TIS requirements and does not consider normal promotion ineligibility
          conditions.
             1.14.2.3.2.1. Individuals in student status or who are participating in the World
             Class Athlete Program are not eligible to compete for BTZ promotion at this time.
             1.14.2.3.2.2. Individuals in Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) 1C2X1 and 1T2X1
             are eligible for BTZ consideration, provided they have obtained a 3 skill level and are
             recommended by their Unit Commander IAW AFI 36-2502, Para. 2.2.1.
          1.14.2.3.3. Establish Quotas: Quotas are based on 15 percent of the total TIG and
          TIS eligible population, regardless of normal ineligibility conditions (remove students
          and World Class Athletes from the eligible population). The MPS determines quotas
          and the Chief, Manpower and Personnel Flight will approve the quotas before
          distribution to the units. Large units (seven or more eligible) receive quotas and
          promote at unit level. Small units (six or less eligible) are combined into one pool of
          eligible to form the CBB population.
             1.14.2.3.3.1. Computation: Eligible multiplied by 15 percent equals the quota.
             Example: 13 eligible x 0.15=1.95, or 2 BTZ quotas. (Note: Fractions of 0.5 or
             more are rounded up)
DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                  11


Table 1.2. BTZ Computations
Eligible               Quota        Eligible      Quota
7-9                    1            37-43         6
10-16                  2            44-49         7
17-23                  3            50-56         8
24-29                  4            57-63         9
30-36                  5            64-69         10
NOTE: Units may not aggregate at the group level. Example:
436th Medical Group is divided into three units and each unit
commander has promotion authority; therefore, they should not
be considered by the group, but as individual units, and cannot be
added together to make a large unit.

           1.14.2.3.4. Notify Units: Units are notified if they are a large or small unit as soon as
           possible, but not later than the second week of the first processing month.
           1.14.2.3.5. BTZ eligibility of A1Cs receiving a permanent change of station (PCS).
           Determine the quarter the individual is BTZ eligible and ensure a BTZ selection
           folder is prepared prior to PCS departure date. This requires the MPS Career
           Development Element to coordinate on an AF Form 907, Relocation Preparation
           Checklist, for all A1Cs Passing. When a selection folder is not prepared prior to an
           individual’s PCS departure date, the MPS must make every effort to obtain copies of
           the individual’s EPRs and Enlisted SURF by contacting the gaining MPS, or the
           individual at their leave address.
   1.14.3. Units will verify eligibility. Using the MPS listing, verify the eligibility of each
   individual to ensure they meet the TIG and TIS requirements for the current quarter. Only
   verify the TIG and TIS requirements and do not consider normal promotion ineligibility
   conditions. This will ensure that only those meeting the TIG and TIS requirements are
   considered and possibly prevent someone from being considered more than once for a SrA
   BTZ promotion. Remove those names exceeding or not meeting current quarter TIG and TIS
   requirements and determine if a previous quarter board in fact considered them. Do this by
   reviewing that quarter’s roster if serviced by the current MPS, or contact the previous MPS.
   For individuals not considered during the quarter in which they met TIG and TIS eligibility,
   and are recommended by the commander, request supplemental BTZ consideration.
   1.14.4. Enlisted Single Uniform Retrieval Format (SURF) Requirement:
        1.14.4.1. Enlisted SURFs: An Enlisted SURF can be found in the members AMS
        account under the Personnel Information/My Career Brief/Consolidated SURF.
   1.14.5. The following procedures are required to ensure fair, equitable, and timely BTZ
   consideration:
        1.14.5.1. Instruct individuals to correct any erroneous data prior to the board convening
        date. Only provide individuals on Part III of the unit listing a Record Review Listing
        (RRL) if during review it is found the ineligible condition is invalid and the member later
12                                                  DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014


     becomes eligible. Supplemental consideration will not be given if incorrect data is
     reflected on the BTZ Report on Individual Personnel (RIP).
     1.14.5.2. Units will consider all individuals meeting TIS and TIG requirements, even if
     they are on temporary duty (TDY), leave, a permanent change of assignment (PCA), or
     have a report not later than date (RNLTD) on or after the first day of the first processing
     month (i.e., Jan, Apr, Jul, and Oct) for that quarter’s selections. All individuals appearing
     on the eligibility listing must be “considered.” As stated earlier, this means the
     commander must review an Airman’s EPR(s), their personnel record, personal
     information file (PIF), Unfavorable Information File (UIF) and discuss the consideration
     with the supervisor and chain of command before making a BTZ decision, to include if
     the Airman will meet a unit or base selection process. The MPS will verify BTZ
     eligibility of A1Cs departing PCS (determine the quarter the individual is BTZ eligible)
     and ensure a BTZ selection folder is prepared prior to PCS departure.
  1.14.6. Selection Procedures: Selection will be based on information contained in the
  selection folder only; nominees will not physically meet a board.
     1.14.6.1. The CBB or commander is not required to use all of the quotas if they feel early
     promotion is not warranted.
     1.14.6.2. Large Unit Selection Procedures: Commanders of units with seven or more
     eligible are considered “large units” and will have their own quota of promotions to
     award. Large units will consider all A1Cs identified by the MPS as being eligible for
     promotion consideration to SrA BTZ. The MPS will provide commanders of large units
     with a list of all eligible A1Cs and suspense for identifying the selected airmen to be
     promoted. Commanders of large units are the promotion authority and their decision to
     promote is final. Large unit selection procedures will basically mirror the CBB selection
     procedures. A commander may request to send individuals to the CBB, rather than
     conducting a squadron board upon wing commander approval.
        1.14.6.2.1. Large Unit Board Composition: Commanders of large units will convene
        a unit selection board. The board will consist of at least two Senior Non-
        Commissioned Officers (SNCOs) and a Chief Master Sergeant (CMSgt). If a CMSgt
        is unavailable, then another SNCO can be appointed instead. The board president
        will establish a time and place for the board to convene, and inform the Unit
        Commander of their nominations and selectees. Board members will evaluate each
        eligible Airman in the same manner as the CBB for small units.
        1.14.6.2.2. Reporting Large Unit Board Results: Once selections are made, large
        Unit Commanders underline the name of the selectee(s), date, sign and return the
        BTZ eligibility listing to the MPS along with the SrA BTZ Results Letter and fitness
        score sheets, no later than the first duty day after the CBB has convened.
     1.14.6.3. Small Unit CBB Nomination Procedures: Commanders of units with less than
     seven eligible are considered “small units” and will not earn their own quota of
     promotions to award. The MPS will provide Commanders of small units with a list of all
     eligible A1Cs.
        1.14.6.3.1. Nomination Package: For each nominee selected to appear before the
        CBB, the Unit Commander will submit one copy of the AF Form 1206, Nomination
DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014                                                            13


         for Award. The nomination will be a maximum of 15 lines in length excluding
         headings. The AF Form 1206 (front side only) will be allowed with the mandatory
         nine lines of leadership and job performance, three lines of significant self-
         improvement efforts, and three lines of base/community involvement. Any AF Form
         1206 submitted in the improper format will be returned to the unit for corrections by
         the final suspense date, if time permits. A current fitness score printout from Air
         Force Portal, and Enlisted SURF printout from AMS.
         1.14.6.3.2. The Unit Commander will determine the method for the selecting his/her
         eligible(s) for the CBB (see note below). The commander must review the Airman’s
         personnel record, fitness status, PIF; discuss consideration with the supervisor and
         chain of command, etc., before making a BTZ decision. It is recommended that the
         Commander utilize the board process to ensure a fair selection. If a board is
         convened, utilize the CBB selection procedures. There is no requirement to fill a
         quota just for the unit to be represented.
         1.14.6.3.3. The MPS, Career Development Element, will ensure all nomination
         packages from units with eligible are received. If a unit is not going to nominate an
         individual, a negative reply is required.
  1.14.7. Central Base Board Processes (Records only)
     1.14.7.1. Board Composition: The CBB will be managed by the 436 AW/CCC. Per
     AFI36-2502, Career Development personnel will be appointed as a non-voting recorder
     will be appointed in the grade of E-5 or higher. This recorder will assist the board by
     ensuring records are provided, compiling minutes of the board, tabulating results of the
     board, and ensuring the board complies with directives. All members must act in the best
     interest of the Air Force and not for any particular group or squadron to determine those
     Airmen that have demonstrated the best potential for early advancement to SrA. Once
     appointed, board members will be committed to serve, unless excused by the Wing
     Commander or Command Chief.
         1.14.7.1.1. Board Processing: Board members will receive the nomination packages
         no later than (NLT) the Friday prior to the board convening. This gives each member
         enough time to examine each package and determine their order-of-merit.
         1.14.7.1.2. The board will spend the majority of their time examining the member’s
         leadership, accomplishments and job performance that contribute significantly to
         increase mission effectiveness. They will also ascertain if the scope and level of
         responsibilities and the impact of the mission and unit is the quality of someone
         deserving higher rank.
         1.14.7.1.3. In addition to job performance, board members may determine if the
         member has shown improvement in skills related to primary duties. Also, determine
         if the member’s training or activities, to include any off-duty education, have
         significantly enhanced the member’s value as a military member.
            1.14.7.1.3.1. Finally, the board determines if an individual’s base and community
            involvement contributed tangibly or intangibly to the military or civilian
            community’s welfare, morale or status. NOTE: All A1Cs may not have the same
            opportunity to complete off-duty education or be heavily involved in the
14                                                 DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014


            community, so take into consideration AFSC training requirements, work
            schedules, and deployment rates when assessing education levels.
     1.14.7.2. Selection Folder Scoring. The board members will look at the whole person
     concept and the individual’s outstanding performance for their entire career when scoring
     their selection folder. Each nominee’s leadership qualities, articulate and positive
     representation of the Air Force, and other accomplishments are evaluated based on the
     facts contained in the AF Form 1206 and enlisted SURF compared with others eligible.
        1.14.7.2.1. Board members will use a numerical scoring system to help determine
        their order-of-merit for the eligible Airmen on the “SrA BTZ Board Selection Folder
        Score Worksheet” prior to the board convening. The three categories to be scored
        are: Leadership and Job Performance, Significant Self-Improvement and Education,
        and Base and Community Involvement. Scoring for each category will be done in
        half point increments only. Once the board member scores the packages, he/she will
        rank-order the nominees. Once the board convenes, each voting member will provide
        their order-of-merit to the board president or recorder.
            1.14.7.2.1.1. Leadership and Job Performance: Nominees must have 9 bullets in
            this area, heading not included. Examine the Airman’s leadership
            accomplishments, job performance, acceptance of responsibility, process
            improvement, unusual jobs or key additional duties, job effectiveness, knowledge,
            and support of deploying operations, etc., that contributed significantly to increase
            mission effectiveness. The goal in this area is to identify actions, initiative, and
            results that clearly demonstrate the individual’s outstanding performance.
            Ascertain if the scope and level of responsibilities and the impact of the mission
            and unit is the quality of someone deserving higher rank. Also, determine the
            individual’s ranking among their own peers and awards received, such as
            quarterly and annual awards (Base Level or Higher). Keep in mind their
            contributions towards unit awards as well.
            1.14.7.2.1.2. Significant Self-Improvement and Education: Nominees must have
            3 bullets in this area, heading not included. This area illustrates broadening,
            diversity, and efforts towards advancing capability. Determine if the Airman has
            shown improvement in skills related to primary duties, such as formal training,
            Career Development Course (CDC) enrollment or completion, On-the-Job
            training, certifications, or off-duty education related to primary duties. Look for
            CDC score information indicating member obtained a 90 and over percentile on
            their end-of-course exam. Also, determine if the member’s training or activities,
            to include any off-duty education, have significantly enhanced the member’s
            value as a military member.
            1.14.7.2.1.3. Base and Community Involvement: Nominees must have 3 bullets
            in this area, heading not included. This area highlights the individual’s
            involvement in any number of activities in their units, wings, and local
            communities. Place emphasis on those activities directly impacting the mission of
            DAFB (e.g., Base Honor Guard, Airmen’s Council, Base Sponsor Programs, etc.).
            Individual’s commitment level and personal sacrifice are key factors in evaluating
            this area.
DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                15


     1.14.7.3. Establishing the final cutline: The total score will be given to the board
     president and/or recorder when all records have been scored. The board president and/or
     recorder computes the total score of each eligible by adding the ranking numbers of all
     the voting members (i.e., someone ranked by the board members as #1, #2, #1, #4, #2, #1
     will receive a total score of 11). After computing the total scores they will determine an
     order-of-merit by ranking the lowest score first and the highest score last on the “SrA
     BTZ Selection Board President Score Worksheet.” In the event of two or more members
     have the same overall score; the board president will break the tie.
         1.14.7.3.1. Scoring Disparity: Board President may address significant disparity in
         scoring. For example, majority of the board are within an acceptable range (#1, #2,
         #1, #3) and one voting member ranks an individual as their #8. The president will
         lead an open discussion until the board members understand the disparity. If the
         disparity significantly affects the order-of-merit, then that record should be re-scored.
         If the board member(s) cannot resolve the disagreement, then the president will
         provide detailed information in the board report summarizing why the board members
         could not resolve the disparity.
  1.14.8. Reporting Board Results: The board recorder will tabulate the results of the CBB
  and prepare the SrA BTZ Promotion Central Base Board Results Letter signed by the Board
  President and endorsed by the 436 AW/CC, as the approval authority. Included with the
  summary will be the list of board members and order-of-merit (identifying total score and
  select/non-select status). SrA BTZ Large Unit Board selectees are included on a separate
  letter addressed to the 436 AW/CC for information purposes only.
  1.14.9. Promotion Notification Release Procedures: The names of selectees for the CBB
  will not be released until approved by the Wing Commander. The Squadron Commander of
  large units will announce their selectees only after the Wing Commander has approved CBB
  selections. Once CBB results have been approved and signed, the 436 FSS/CC will provide
  a copy of the select list to group commanders and squadron commanders via e-mail.
     1.14.9.1. The MPS will update the personnel records of each selectee.
  1.14.10. Supplemental BTZ Consideration. Commanders may request supplemental BTZ
  consideration for individuals that should have been considered by a previous board and the
  error was not discovered until after promotions were announced. After obtaining the unit
  commander’s recommendation, the MPS will forward the supplemental request to
  Headquarters (HQ), Air Force Personnel Center, Directorate of Personnel Program
  Management, Airman Promotions Branch (HQ AFPC/DPSOE), for consideration. If
  selected, members may apply for a retroactive change to their effective date according to AFI
  36-2502, para 1.13.
     1.14.10.1. Supplemental consideration will not be given for incorrect data reflected on
     the BTZ RIP or for individuals who are denied BTZ nomination due to incorrect data
     reflected on the BTZ output products. It is the individual’s, supervisor’s, and
     Commander’s responsibility to ensure an individual has been properly identified as
     eligible, and most importantly, ensure the data on the BTZ RIP is accurate and complete.
     1.14.10.2. If an individual should have been considered during the current quarter board
     and the error is discovered before promotions are announced, large unit commanders may
 16                                                   DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014


      consider the Airman and adjust selection accordingly (this does not apply to Airmen who
      are gained and it has been determined they were not considered by their losing base).
      The CBB will reconvene to consider small unit eligible and selections will then be
      adjusted accordingly. If discovered after selections are announced, supplemental
      promotion consideration procedures apply. Adjustments will not be made to the gaining
      unit/base quota, if the error is discovered for an individual that should have been
      considered by their losing base. Every effort should be made to ensure the individual is
      considered by their losing unit/base. If the losing unit/base has already announced their
      selection, the gaining base (if Unit Commander recommends) will request supplemental
      consideration.
   1.14.11. Alternates/first non-selectee procedures: Alternates/first non-selectee of the CBB
   or large unit board is selected in the event a selectee is removed before the effective date, due
   to an ineligibility condition (AFI 36-2502, Table 1.1.) or infractions committed after
   selection.

   good order and discipline of the installation, the 436 AW/CC will direct the individual’s
   barment from base. When a significant offense occurs, Security Forces will immediately
   notify the on-call Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) for advice on barment action. If the SJA
   advises barment action is appropriate, contact 436 AW/CC to request barment. If approved,
   a completed pre-signed preliminary barment letter will be immediately issued to the offender.
   Security Forces Reports and Analysis will subsequently staff a barment package containing
   the incident report and preliminary barment letter to 436 AW/CC through the SJA for final
   approval and signature.
   1.18.2. All barment packages for Dover AFB will be initiated and staffed by the Security
   Forces Reports and Analysis section upon 436 AW/CC approval. This is to maintain
   continuity and ensure individuals are added to the base barment roster at the installation entry
   control points.
DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014                                                              23

                                           Chapter 2

                                 SAFETY AND SECURITY

2.1. Culture of Safety
   2.1.1. Airmen, civilians, and their families remain the Air Force’s most precious resource
   and taking care of them is a top priority. Safety is a critical element to this commitment. As
   Team Dover executes its demanding mission, it is crucial to establish a solid foundation
   centered on sound risk management principles.
   2.1.2. Managing risk across dynamic and diverse mission areas does not just happen; rather
   it is the product of two interdependent pillars: organizational safety processes and individual
   responsibility. Degradation of either threatens the whole.
   2.1.3. As an organization, the safety infrastructure is well established and mature processes
   are maintained to continually review and strengthen this framework. It is the responsibility
   of commanders to ensure every member of Team Dover is provided the guidance, equipment
   and training to ensure safety both on and off the job. Commanders and supervisors, at every
   level are expected to take immediate and decisive action for the safety and well-being of
   Team Dover.
   2.1.4. The second pillar is individual responsibility. Organizational processes ensure people
   are knowledgeable of, and adequately equipped to fulfill, their roles and responsibilities.
   Willful noncompliance with safety standards, on- or off-duty, is a breach of good order and
   discipline. Supervisors will clearly articulate high expectations concerning every member’s
   personal responsibility for their own safety. Holding people accountable closes the loop in
   organizational safety processes.
2.2. High Risk Activity
   2.2.1. Every Airman is needed to accomplish the demanding global mission and protecting
   personnel remains the highest priority.
   2.2.2. Military personnel who participate in high risk activities must inform their supervisor,
   complete the Dover AFB High Risk Activity Worksheet (may be found on the Wing Ground
   Safety EIM site in the High Risk Activity folder), and present a briefing to their commander
   detailing their personal risk mitigation measures. Commanders will make the final
   determination if participants are adequately trained and have employed all available risk
   mitigation steps prior to participating in any high-risk activities.
2.3. Operational Security Critical Information
   2.3.1. Unit OPSEC coordinators are to brief new arrivals on the importance of properly
   protecting this information. The responsibility to protect this information rests with each
   individual assigned to Dover AFB. The 436 AW cannot afford lapses in operational security
   that jeopardizes the lives and resources within this command.
2.4. Operational Security Countermeasures
   2.4.1. Military adversaries, criminals, terrorists and others continually seek to exploit our
   information vulnerabilities. Application of operations security (OPSEC) countermeasures is
 26                                                   DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014


   essential to the protection of our critical information. (Ref: 436 AW Critical Information List
   located at https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/436awxp/opsec/default.aspx).
   2.4.2. To counter those who wish to exploit our vulnerabilities, the 436 AW/CC directs the
   following procedures:
       2.4.2.1. Information transmitted verbally, electronically or textually will be restricted to
       personnel possessing a “need-to-know.” All personnel will protect personal information
       IAW the Privacy Act of 1974, DoD 5400.11-R, DoD Privacy Act Program and AFI 33-
       332 (specifically para 1.1.11.4), Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program. Failure to
       comply could result in punishment under Article 92 of the UCMJ or civil equivalent. If
       Privacy Act, PII, FOUO or Critical Information must be transmitted via email, DOD
       Public Key Infrastructure encryption will be used. In the event that a Contractor or off-
       base agency requests any of the above information, contact the 436 AW OPSEC Program
       Managers.
       2.4.2.2. 100% Shred Policy: All internally generated office paperwork, which is not
       publicly available, regardless of classification, must be shredded prior to being recycled.
       Shredders should be readily available for use within the unit.
       2.4.2.3. Secure all electronic communication devices prior to sensitive or classified
       briefings. Devices must remain outside briefing rooms for the duration of the briefings.
       2.4.2.4. Commanders, OPSEC POCs and web page monitors at all levels will conduct
       OPSEC reviews prior to publishing data on any website, public or NIPRNET. Units will
       also conduct annual reviews of shared drives to ensure only necessary data is retained.
       All unnecessary data will be filed IAW unit established records disposition schedule.
       Access to files containing Privacy Act, PII, FOUO or Critical Information, including
       Access Database files on network shared drives will be limited to individuals that have an
       official valid “need-to-know.” File and information access will be controlled using strict
       network drive and EIM site permissions, and password protection may be added as an
       additional layer of protection.
       2.4.2.5. Personnel should verify the credentials of any unfamiliar person entering non-
       public facilities (mission essential, restricted, controlled entry areas, etc.).
       2.4.2.6. OPSEC and the efforts to protect critical information must be taken seriously.
       Direct any questions to 436 AW OPSEC Program Managers.
2.5. Civic Leader Use and Eligibility
   2.5.1. In accordance with AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility, the Wing
   Commander authorizes extension of invitations to leaders in the local community designated
   on the Dover Air Force Base Civic Leaders list. These invitations permit unescorted access
   to Dover AFB to utilize Eagle Creek Golf Course on a self-directed and reoccurring basis.
   Use of the Eagle Creek Golf Course will be on a space available basis. These newly
   authorized personnel cannot displace other authorized users with higher priority and will pay
   established guest fees.
   2.5.2. These personnel will be authorized to enter Dover AFB. They will also be permitted
   to sponsor up to four guests accompanying them to the golf course, but will need to obtain a
DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                27


   temporary visitor pass at the 436 SFS Visitor Center following normal established
   procedures.
2.6. Motorcycle Safety Program
   2.6.1. Over the past decade, the Air Force has lost more Airmen to motorcycle mishaps than
   in combat and more than 2,000 members have lost duty time to injuries sustained in
   motorcycle mishaps. Additionally, safety analysis reveals the underlying cause of most
   mishaps has been a lack of proficiency and faulty situational assessment.
   2.6.2. Commanders must be thoroughly involved with their unit motorcycle safety program
   as preventable accidents and injuries reduce force readiness and negatively affect mission
   accomplishment. Squadron commander’s initial motorcycle safety briefing will be
   documented utilizing the AMC Form 91 or equivalent.
   2.6.3. All active duty military motorcycle riders assigned to Dover AFB must attend and
   complete a Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) course before operating a motorcycle.
   MSF courses consist of either the Basic Riders Course (BRC) or the Basic Riders Course II
   (BRC II).
   2.6.4. Additionally, all active duty military members who own or operate a sport bike must
   complete an approved sport bike training course. The goal is to provide riders with the
   opportunity to further refine their riding strategies and skills, thereby reducing the risk
   associated with operating a sport bike. If sport bike riders have fulfilled the requirements of
   Paragraph 3 above, they may operate their motorcycles while awaiting a sport bike training
   class. All sport bike riders must attend the sport bike training course within 30 days of
   purchasing a new sport bike, in-processing the base, or upgrading sport bike in engine size by
   200cc or more. Individuals who fail the sport bike training are required to retake the course
   within 30 days of the failure. The Wing Safety Office retains final authority in determining
   the definition of a sport bike.
   2.6.5. To ensure training compliance, each military rider must have these requirements
   validated, in writing, by the Wing Safety Office. Once this is accomplished, members may
   then obtain a training certification card from the Dover AFB Visitor Center. This card must
   be presented, along with the member’s identification card, when entering the installation.
   2.6.6. We must all take a proactive role in motorcycle safety in order to protect our valuable
   Dover teammates. Training, discipline, and mentorship are absolutely key to this program
   and will help ensure the safe attitudes and practices so essential to success. This policy
   supersedes all others on the same subject and is in addition to the requirements of DoDI
   6055.04, AFI 91-207, and the AMC supplement to AFI 91-207.
2.7. Mandatory Bulletin Board Postings
   2.7.1. All bulletin boards will be updated on a monthly basis to ensure that only current
   policy letters and flyers containing current personnel names and pictures are displayed.
   2.7.2. At a minimum, the policy letters and posters will be displayed in high traffic areas,
   such as squadron administration and break areas.
   2.7.3. The minimum list and all of the letters can be located on EIM using the following

   2.8.1. In order to maintain compliance with AFI 91-203, paragraphs 35.2.1.1 – 35.2.1.6 and
   35.2.3 – 35.2.3.4, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction, the 436th Aerial
   Port Squadron is approved to park diesel and/or propane-powered forklifts inside building 550.
      2.8.1.1. The following forklifts will be parked within designated and marked parking
      spaces.
          2.8.1.1.1. 8 4K Propane Forklifts.
          2.8.1.1.2. 6 10K Standard Forklifts.
2.9. Combating Trafficking in Persons (CTIP)
   2.9.1. Trafficking in Persons (TIP) is the second largest criminal activity in the world, only
   after drug trafficking. TIP is defined as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or
   receipt of persons by means of threat, use of force, coercion, abduction, fraud, deception,
   abuse or exploitation. TIP is a grave violation of human rights and a worldwide criminal
   threat to security, civil rights, and stability as well as a direct threat to our national foreign
   policy goals. Due to the seriousness of the crime, the egregious results in terms of human
   tragedy, and the disabling impact on our military readiness, the DoD has established a “zero
   tolerance” for trafficking in persons.
      2.9.1.1. AFF 36-2921, Combating Trafficking in Persons (CTIP) establishes DOD policy
      on CTIP. This instruction requires all military members and DoD civilians to complete
      general awareness training annually. Although this training is not mandatory for
      contractors they are encouraged to complete the training for awareness purposes.
      2.9.1.2. Military members and DoD civilians can complete this annual requirement
      through ADLS, https://golearn.csd.disa.mil by completing the Human Relations module
      under Total Force Awareness Training.
   2.9.2. The 436 AW/CC fully endorse the AF’s “zero tolerance” for TIP and expect all
   personnel associated with Dover AFB to be vigilant of the negative impacts TIP could have
   on our base and/or Wing’s readiness and professional climate. All personnel must identify
   and report suspicious behavior that may indicate TIP activities to your chain of command,
   Security Forces at 677-6666, AFOSI at 677-6920, Inspector General at 677-4048, or the
   Wing CTIP monitors.
      2.9.2.1. For additional information on CTIP visit the 436 FSS Base Training EIM site

              3.2.1.2.1.3. Variations must be approved in writing by MSG/CC.
              3.2.1.2.1.4. Implement (as a minimum) a two week no-heat/no-cool season spring
              and fall.
      3.2.1.3. Increased surveillance of energy usage to raise the awareness of energy
      conservation requirements. The Base Energy Management Policy contains direction on
      energy conservation; however, Dover AFB is establishing a more robust compliance
      program in order to enforce the guidance and regulations outlined in this instruction. To
      further increase the awareness of the Policy and the related practices described therein,
      select base personnel have been tasked to spot check energy use by randomly assessing
      base facilities. Typical things being looked at include improperly set thermostats,
      unauthorized space heaters, personal use items that are not being used efficiently, and
      lighting of unoccupied areas. The informal assessments can occur at any time and could
      be without notice. Energy assessors will document findings and initially work with the
      facility managers to correct the concern. Energy assessors will report repeat offenders to
      the organizational commanders with possible elevation to group and wing levels of
      management. CES will also be looking for unit level energy conservation initiatives that
      might be applicable to other locations across Dover AFB. Finally, energy accessory will
      document and elevate positive findings for appreciation and recognition.
      3.2.1.4. Facility Manager support for manual meter reading: Facility managers for
      facilities without automatic reporting capability will send meter data to 436 CES/CEAO
      on a monthly basis. This additional duty for the facility manager should not require
      significant effort and should help the facility managers keep tabs on how well their
      buildings are performing with respect to energy use. The CES Energy Program Manager
      will work directly with facility managers on how, where and when to read their facility
      meter(s).
3.3. Task Management Tool (TMT)
   3.3.1. Headquarters USAF implemented the TMT application to help manage staff work
   within the senior levels of the Air Force. Unless restricted by classification, TMT should be
   used at all levels in the 436 AW as the primary means of staffing.
   3.3.2. 436 AW's goal is to remain responsive to the Air Force enterprise by working ahead
   of tasks and suspense dates in a priority order. 436 AW task priorities are as follows:
      3.3.2.1. Priority 1: Tasks originating from HHQ AMC or Higher.
      3.3.2.2. Priority 2: Tasks originating from other external organizations.
      3.3.2.3. Priority 3: Tasks that originate from within 436 AW.
   3.3.3. Classified tasks will not be worked in TMT. Place holder tasks may be created in
   TMT for coordination and tracking purposes; ensure no classified content is loaded in TMT.
   There is a classified version of TMT. Classified taskers will use the Classified version of
   TMT.
DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014                                                               31


3.4. Appointment Letter Management Tool (ALMT)
   3.4.1. The purpose of the ALMT is to
      3.4.1.1. Provide Unit Commanders with a single location for all unit appointment letters.
      3.4.1.2. Create a database for appointment letters that maintains version history in order
      to prove compliance over time.
      3.4.1.3. Move forward with the electronic records concept, saving time and resources.
      3.4.1.4. Further enable Virtual Inspection options for the Inspector General.
   3.4.2. All appointment letters for 436 AW Units will be maintained in ALMT.
      3.4.2.1. A template will be maintained for all AFI, MAJCOM supplement or instruction
      and Dover AFB supplement or instruction required appointment letters from which units
      will create their appointment letter for that specific program.
          3.4.2.1.1. The required templates will be maintained by the OPR for the program or
          AFI requiring the appointment letter.
          3.4.2.1.2. Any appointment letter requiring Security Clearance verification (i.e.,
          OPSEC) must be signed by the Unit Security Manager prior to Unit CC signature.
   3.4.3. Unit Commanders are encouraged to use the ALMT to maintain any additional
   appointment letters unique to their organization at their discretion.
      3.4.3.1. Unit specific appointment letters will not have an associated template maintained
      in the ALMT, and it will be the unit's responsibility to create their own letters.
   3.4.4. ALMT will only host appointment letters, designations of official or additional duties
   and access authorization letters. Do not use ALMT for general correspondence or memos
   requiring signature.
   3.4.5. Standardization and Content. Standardization will be a key component to the success
   of ALMT.
      3.4.5.1. In order for the Units and Wing Level Program Managers to successfully utilize
      the ALMT and its sorting capability, All To and From Office Symbols and appointment
      letter titles must be correct in accordance with established templates.
      3.4.5.2. Unit CCs should ensure a quality control system similar to that used for all paper
      correspondence is also in place for appointment letters in the ALMT. Unit CC's are
      ultimately responsible for the content and formatting of the appointment letters for their
      unit.
      3.4.5.3. Units should designate an ALMT manager to assist with the quality control and
      standardization aspects. Training for this position will be available from the 436
      Communications Squadron.
      3.4.5.4. Only upload attachments to appointment letters (or templates) if a specific form
      or other required document is required per AFI guidance or is deemed absolutely
      necessary by the Unit/CC.
      3.4.5.5. Do not include Personally Identifying Information (PII) in any appointment
      letters unless required by AFI.
 32                                                 DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014


      3.4.5.6. Once an appointment letter has been created, do not initiate a new appointment
      letter to make changes or updates. Edit the current version and save the new letter to
      maintain the integrity of the version history within the ALMT.
3.5. Investigation and Reporting Requirements for Sexual Assault Reports
   3.5.1. 436 AW commanders who receive an Unrestricted Report of a sexual assault shall
   immediately refer the matter to OSI. A unit commander shall not conduct an internal
   command directed investigation on a sexual assault or delay immediately contacting OSI
   while attempting to assess the credibility of the report.
   3.5.2. When a sexual assault is reported through Unrestricted Reporting, the SARC shall be
   notified immediately, the SARC will respond or direct a SAPR VA to respond and offer the
   victim healthcare treatment and a SAFE. The SARC will report the alleged sexual assault to
   the 436 AW/CC or CV for determination of reporting requirements as soon as possible, but
   no later than 24 hours after the initial complaint is made.
   3.5.3. Commanders have the authority to allow civilians to serve as Victim Advocates in the
   Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) program; however, time must be accounted
   for and records maintained to reflect civilian time served. Contact the Civilian Personnel
   Section for further requirements/information.
3.6. Investigation and Reporting Requirements for Sexual Harassment Complaints
   3.6.1. Federal law mandates that all sexual harassment claims made by military members or
   civilian DoD employees be promptly investigated by the unit commander or OIC and that 18
   AF/CC be notified of any such claim within 72 hours of the initial complaint.
   3.6.2. To ensure compliance with this reporting requirement, 436 AW commanders shall
   provide a copy of the complaint or a written description of the allegation to 436 AW/CC as
   soon as possible, but no later than 48 hours after the initial complaint is made.
   3.6.3. Any questions concerning reporting requirements or proper steps to conduct a required
   investigation should be directed to the base Equal Opportunity office or base Legal Office.
   3.6.4. Points of Contact for Civilian Employee Complaints of Sexual Harassment:
      3.6.4.1. The FY98 National Defense Authorization Act, 10 U.S.C. §1561 establishes a
      requirement for the investigation into and reporting of sexual harassment complaints filed
      by civilian employees. In addition to other avenues such as Equal Employment
      Opportunity (EEO) complaints, grievances, and mixed case appeals to the Merit Systems
      Protection Board, civilian employees can now request a commander-directed inquiry into
      allegations of sexual harassment while a concurrently running EEO complaint is taking
      place.
      3.6.4.2. Dover Air Force Base is required to name a POC to receive these complaints and
      provide a written detailed description of the allegation to the 436 AW/CC within 48 hours
      after initial contact by the complainant. The commander will then provide the General
      Court-Martial Convening Authority with the POC's notification, direct a time-sensitive
      inquiry into the truth of the allegation, and advise the complainant of the commencement
      of the investigation. Upon completion of the inquiry, appropriate corrective action will
      be taken. No monetary damages can be awarded through the complaint process and there
      is no appeal from the final decision.
DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                 33


      3.6.4.3. The Wing Director of Staff shall serve as the POC for civilian employees who
      want to request a commander-directed inquiry into allegations of sexual harassment
      pursuant to 10 U.S.C. § 1561. In the absence of the Director of Staff, requests should be
      directed to the Wing Executive Officer.
      3.6.4.4. The EO Office serves as Subject Matter Experts (SME) for commanders and
      organizations conducting investigations under section 1561.
3.7. Reports of Survey (ROS) Approving Authority
   3.7.1. In accordance with AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property,
   Chapter 8, paragraph 8.4.1., the 436 AW/CC hereby delegates the ROS approving authority
   responsibilities to the Director of Staff and each Group Commander. The approving
   authority takes action on ROS when the amount of financial liability to be assessed is equal
   to or less than $10,000. When the amount of financial liability to be assessed is greater than
   $10,000 or when the 436 AW/CC is personally involved, the approving authority will
   forward the ROS to the installation ROS administrator who will forward it to HQ AMC for
   action. Detailed responsibilities are outlined in AFMAN 23-220, Chapter 10, paragraph 10.1.
      3.7.1.1. The 436th Mission Support Group is appointed as the installation ROS
      administrator and is responsible for establishing internal operating procedures, providing
      training to unit monitors, and advising approving and appointing officials. The ROS
      administrator responsibilities are outlined in AFMAN 23-220, Chapter 11, and paragraph
      11.4.1. through 11.4.12.
      3.7.1.2. Group Commanders are authorized to designate their deputies as appointing
      authority. This person must be designated in writing by the approving authority and is
      responsible for reviewing and processing ROS for their respective groups.
      3.7.1.3. Each unit will designate in writing, a primary and alternate unit ROS monitor.
3.8. Gatekeeper Policy
   3.8.1. Per AFI 90-201 AMCSUP, Inspector General Activities: “Each AMC host
   installation is required to assign an Installation Gatekeeper who will coordinate with the HQ
   AMC Gatekeeper and requesting agencies to de-conflict visit activities, minimize visit
   impacts, avoid duplication and keep unit commanders informed.”
   3.8.2. 436 AW/IG will act as the Dover AFB Gatekeeper. The Gatekeeper will serve as the
   centralized notification, coordination, and tracking system for all types of base visits and
   inspections to ensure base leadership awareness and schedule de-confliction.
   3.8.3. All visits requiring support or base assets or airmen will be forwarded to the 436 AW
   Gatekeepers and must include a completed Gatekeeper Notification Form, located on the
   Gatekeeper EIM. Visit requests must be submitted no later than 14 calendar days prior to
   visitor arrival; visits requiring significant base support (i.e. 50 or more people) require 30
   calendar days’ notice prior to visitor arrival. Visits are not official until 436 AW/CC
   approvals is obtained.
   3.8.4. Any inspection-based visits need AMC coordination and approval prior to the visit.
   The visiting agency will submit that request to the AMC Gatekeeper at
   AMC.IG.Gatekeeper@us.af.mil. The AMC Gatekeeper deadline for these visits is 30 days
   prior.
 34                                                  DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014


   3.8.5. Due to unique requirements, limited resources and the visibility of the organizations,
   visits to the Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs (AFMAO), Joint Personal Effects
   Depot (JPED), and Armed Forces Medical Examiners (AFMES) are considered special
   category visits. Coordination for these organizations is done through each respective
   organization, including notification to 436 AW Protocol (if appropriate).
   3.8.6. Please direct Gatekeeper       questions    to   436   AW/IG      Gatekeeper    email
   436aw.gatekeeper@us.af.mil.
3.9. Management of Events on Wing Enterprise Information Management (EIM) Site
   3.9.1. The Wing has established a calendar of events on the Base Bulletin EIM site:
   https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/436msg/BaseBulletin/default.aspx. This page serves as the
   Dover AFB information site for base-wide events and information dissemination among
   Team Dover personnel.
   3.9.2. Given the number of different information sources for events on base, the following
   organizations will share responsibility for publishing events and announcements to this site:
   436 AW/PA, 436 AW/XP, and 436 AW/CCA.
   3.9.3. Each organization will designate a primary and alternate content manager; Annual
   training on both EIM and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) will be required for
   content managers.
   3.9.4. The 436 CS will provide systems administration and technical support, assisting with
   the site design, assigning of permissions and troubleshooting for the EIM site. Additionally,
   the 436 CS will provide EIM and PII training for appointed content managers.
   3.9.5. The 436 AW/PA will provide applicable guidance to the content managers. The
   AW/DS and/or designated alternate will have final decision authority should there be any
   questions, concerns, or disagreements over guidance or site content.
3.10. Public Affairs Photography Services
   3.10.1. The 436th Airlift Wing Public Affairs (PA) Office provides professional
   photography products and services for installation units and personnel. Photography is an
   essential element of internal and external communication programs. Imagery conveys the
   mission of the Air Force to internal and external audiences and helps achieve the PA core
   competencies of Airman morale and readiness, public trust and support, and global influence
   and deterrence.
   3.10.2. The PA office is not funded, equipped, or manned to replace services provided by the
   Document Automation Production Service (DAPS). According to DODI 5330.3, Document
   Automation and Production Service (DAPS), the Air Force must obtain automated printing
   services from DAPS.
   3.10.3. The 436 AW/PA office photography function provides:
      3.10.3.1. Professional photographers to support base-level photographic requirements for
      managerial, operational, training, educational, historical archiving, investigative, and
      administrative purposes.
      3.10.3.2. Studio photography for official portraits as prescribed in AFI 36-2632, Official
      Photographs of Air Force General Officers, AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Responsibilities

       tenant support agreement.
       3.10.3.4. Digital imagery and/or prints to meet official organizational needs.
       Photographic prints are not available for personal use. Digital files may be made
       available to customers via email, CD/DVD (provided by customer) or local Enterprise
       Information Management (EIM) system for printing at their own expense.
       3.10.3.5. When photographers or photographic equipment resources are not available,
       the PA office may offer consumer-grade still photographic equipment for self-help use if
       the equipment is in the office inventory.
   3.10.4. The following is a list of installation-level photography support services and a
   priority system for services provided by the 436 AW/PA Office. Deviations from this policy

3.11. Reduced Operations
   3.11.1. When hazardous weather or other events occur which necessitate reduced operations,
   personnel should keep informed, adjust their home-to-work travel time accordingly, and
   remain alert for special radio and television announcements as conditions change. The latest
   reporting instructions can also be found by accessing the Dover AFB website from home or
   the base at http://www.dover.af.mil; http://www.facebook.com/pages/436th-Airlift-
   Wing/300720323076?ref=ts; or http://twitter.com/436AirliftWing or by calling (302) 677-
   BASE(2273). Unless notified otherwise, personnel will be expected to report for work as
   scheduled.
   3.11.2. Service Categories: Senior leadership must plan for base operation during adverse
   weather conditions. When required, the Crisis Action Team (CAT) will monitor weather
   conditions, and determine who will be needed for specific base operations depending upon
   the conditions. The Office of Personnel Management's designations of “emergency”" and
   “essential” will be used to categorize civilian employees as explained below, with military
   personnel falling under the same categories.
38                                                  DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014


     3.11.2.1. Categories: Squadron Commanders will determine the designated category of
     the personnel. Civilian employees will be notified in writing of their category
     designation and supervisors will annotate the designated category on the AF Form 971,
     Supervisor’s Employee Brief, maintained for each employee. Management will make
     every effort to include their union representatives in the process of notifying employees
     of their designation. Squadrons will designate the categories of their military personnel
     on unit recall rosters or as determined by unit operating procedures. There are four
     categories of personnel for Reduced Operations, see below.
         3.11.2.1.1. Emergency employees are those needed at work as scheduled regardless
         of the operational condition or weather situation. Typically, these are hospital
         employees, snow removal crews, food service workers, fire fighters, and others
         designated by commanders. It is important that Emergency employees clearly
         understand they must report for work as scheduled. Dover Air Force Base
         Emergency Services Identification Cards are available to civilian Emergency
         employees through the Civilian Personnel Section, allowing them to drive to work
         even when roads are closed to normal traffic.
         3.11.2.1.2. Mission Essential Level 1 (MEL 1) personnel provide indispensable
         services necessary for flight line operations and Base Civil Engineer support services.
         3.11.2.1.3. Mission Essential Level 2 (MEL 2) personnel provide indispensable
         services necessary for non-flight line operations.
         3.11.2.1.4. Mission Essential Level 3 (MEL 3) personnel provide services that can be
         postponed until weather/operational conditions improve or change.
         3.11.2.1.5. Personnel in training/school on Dover AFB will normally be considered
         MEL 3 unless recalled to work by their supervisors or training is
         terminated/suspended. In the latter event, personnel are responsible for contacting
         their work center supervisors.
     3.11.2.2. All personnel assigned to Mission Essential Levels 1, 2, and 3 must provide
     their supervisors with a telephone number where they can be reached for recall during
     weather recovery operations. They also must remain alert to changing conditions and
     listen to the radio and television for up-to-date information (Note: Military personnel will
     provide supervisors with telephone number(s) if different than the number listed on the
     recall roster). When MEL civilian employees are not required to report to or remain at
     work, they become entitled to administrative leave until recalled to work or normal
     conditions resume. Since MEL civilian employees will be expected to be at work at
     varying times, the amount of administrative leave will vary and is not necessarily in
     eight-hour increments. As a reminder, MEL requirements will change as conditions
     change.
  3.11.3. Reduced Operations/Base Closure: As conditions develop, the 436th AW/CC will
  make the decision to reduce operations or close the base and grant administrative leave. By
  regulation, the authority to make this decision may not be further delegated. When required,
  the CAT will be formed to ensure consideration of critical factors in all work places.
  Decisions will be shared with union leadership as soon as possible thereafter.
DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                 39


      3.11.3.1. Press releases will be provided to select radio and television stations and sent to
      key work centers when limited operations are scheduled. Press releases will state the
      category of employees who are expected to report for work, specific shift information,
      and other special information.
      3.11.3.2. A message will be given to the radio and television stations listed in Table 3.1
      requesting the installation's information be broadcast exactly as written. If possible,
      announcements will begin at 0530 hours and be repeated as frequently as necessary. This
      action is intended to prevent unnecessary travel by employees who are not required to
      report for work. Updates will be made as conditions change. All personnel have an
      obligation to keep in contact with their work center supervisor, to listen or watch these
      broadcasts, and to report for work accordingly.

      3.11.3.3. Standardized statements have been approved for use to announce reduced
      operations at Dover AFB due to inclement weather. These statements may be adjusted as
      necessary to fit the situation.
   3.11.4. Early Dismissal: If conditions present travel concerns, the 436 AW/CC may institute
   a liberal unscheduled leave policy for civilians or authorize early dismissal and grant
   civilians administrative leave if conditions worsen. This authority may not be further
   delegated.
      3.11.4.1. Standard notification will follow the above guidance and specify departure
      time, affected categories, and return times, if known.
      3.11.4.2. When conditions change, additional personnel may be released or recalled as
      outlined above. Squadron Commanders will again determine who must remain and who
      may leave work. Personal considerations such as family situations, distance of travel to
      and from work, employee health problems, etc., should be considered in a fair and
      equitable manner with deciding who may leave early and who will remain at work.
3.12. Operational Reporting Requirements Policy
   3.12.1. In accordance with AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, and the AMC Supplement,
   all AMC Wing Commanders must implement a written policy requiring all units on their
   station to immediately provide information on potentially reportable events/incidents to the
   Command Post.
   3.12.2. This serves as the official wing guidance to outline required unit commander
   responsibilities to provide the 436 AW the ability to meet OPREP-3 reporting requirements
   and provides guidance on reporting support provided by the 436 AW Command Post.
 40                                                  DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014


   3.12.3. Unit commanders will immediately provide potentially reportable information
   concerning personnel and other assets to the Command Post and additional information as it
   becomes available. Commanders must be aware of the urgent need to keep the Command
   Post advised of reportable incidents or unusual events. Failure to provide this information in
   a timely manner will delay reporting and inhibit the ability to meet mandatory reporting
   timeline requirements.
   3.12.4. The 436 AW Command Post will serve as both the collection and distribution focal
   point for all operational reporting for Dover AFB in order to meet AFI 10-206 requirements,
   including reporting for tenant units. The Command Post will provide guidance to
   commanders, their units, and other base agencies, as required, during the reporting process
   and will transmit all reports within established guidelines. Additionally, the Command Post
   will protect PII/PHI and will sanitize all reports before submission.
   3.12.5. The final authority for the approval and release of all operational reports will be the
   436 AW/CC, unless the personnel or assets involved in the incident are not activated under
   the 436 AW. In those cases, the owning unit commander will be the final approval and
   releasing authority.
   3.12.6. When considering whether or not a particular event/incident is reportable, consult the
   current Commander’s/First Sergeant’s Operational Reports Handbook or contact the 436 AW
   Command Post immediately for assistance at 677-4201.
3.13. Installation Spectrum Management
   3.13.1. In order to prevent illegal interference of approved frequencies on Dover AFB, the
   following will be implemented in accordance with AFI 33-118, Radio Frequency Spectrum
   Management:
      3.13.1.1. All units utilizing frequency emitting devices (e.g. portable radios, radio base
      stations, wireless network equipment, GPS modules, etc.) must obtain frequency
      assignments prior to utilizing the devices. If the device cannot be configured to operate
      on the assigned frequency, it will not be used on the installation. Standard cellular
      devices are pre-approved for use.
   3.13.2. Questions and concerns can be directed to the 436 CS/SCOT, Transmission Systems
   Office.
3.14. Court-Martial/Administrative Board Duty
   3.14.1. Good order and discipline are absolutely essential for a mission-ready force.
   Military justice is a central component to maintaining and enforcing discipline. Therefore,
   service as a panel member on a court-martial or administrative board is a vital function of the
   greatest importance to both the Air Force, the person accused of wrongdoing, and the
   accused's unit. Advance identification of potential court and board members streamlines
   processing of cases and reduces disruptions caused by last-minute appointments.
   3.14.2. It is important to nominate the best people for the pool. It is imperative to impress
   the importance of court duty to units as well. Accordingly, all commanders, deputies, chiefs
   and first sergeants are considered available for court-martial and administrate board service
   at any time. To facilitate scheduling, please assure all subordinate commanders, deputies,
DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014                                                              41


   chiefs and first sergeants maintain a current Court-Member Data Sheet on file with the base
   legal office.
   3.14.3. If nominated or selected by the 436 AW/CC or AMC/CC, court member duty will be
   treated as that member’s primary duty. Please provide full cooperation in submitting
   questionnaires and in nominating potential court and board members.
3.15. Leave/TDY Requests for Members Identified for Medical Evaluation Board Process
   3.15.1. Effective immediately in accordance with AFI 41-210, Tricare Operations and
   Patient Administration Functions, paragraph 4.53.4, the 436 MDG/CC is designated as the
   approval authority for leave or TDY requests for military members identified to undergo the
   MEB process.
   3.15.2. Members requesting leave or TDY will complete a TDY/leave request memorandum.
   All requests will be routed through and approved at the unit level prior to submission to the
   436 MDG/CC for approval. Requests must be submitted to the Physical Evaluation Board
   Liaison Officer (PEBLO), 436 MDSS/SGST, NLT 10 calendar days prior to requested
   departure date. This will allow time to review the member’s case and de-conflict the
   requested dates with any planned treatment. Exceptions to the process will be handled on a
   case-by-case basis.
   3.15.3. Due to the stringent timelines for MEB case completion and the need for members to
   be readily available, requests for leave or TDY outside of the local area will be highly
   discouraged. Members must understand it is their responsibility to pay for any costs
   associated with their return travel. Members that do not return as outlined in this policy
   could result in disciplinary action.
   3.15.4. The PEBLO will serve as the liaison between the member and the 436th MDG and
   will communicate any changes in the treatment plan to the member. Should there be any
   changes in the treatment plan requiring the member to be physically present, the member will
   return to the local area within 24 hours of notification by the PEBLO.
3.16. Retreat Procedures
   3.16.1. Formation Composition
      3.16.1.1. Minimum composition for units will be one flight of 20 personnel in a 5x4
      formation (width x depth); key personnel will consist of a guidon bearer, squadron
      commander, guide, and flight first sergeant as a minimum. Other key personnel may be
      used IAW AFMAN 36-2203, Drill and Ceremonies. Minimum composition requirements
      are established for units with less than 100 personnel assigned. Flights may be composed
      of officers and enlisted members.
      3.16.1.2. Units larger than 100 personnel assigned may form two flights of equal
      composition. Key personnel must include a flight commander for each flight, squadron
      commander, guiding bearer, and flight first sergeant. Consult AFMAN 36-2203 for more
      specific guidance. Flights may be composed of both officers and enlisted members; the
      Squadron Commander will determine type and numbers.
      3.16.1.3. The Squadron Commander will determine uniform; uniformity is required to
      include undershirts (ensure no sunglasses or gum in formation).
42                                                 DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014


     3.16.1.4. Flag Security Detail will consist of 1 NCO and 3 Airmen for the All Purpose
     Flag and 1 NCO and 5 Airmen for the Base Flag (regardless of unit size).
  3.16.2. Procedures
     3.16.2.1. At 1550, the unit first sergeant will command “FALL IN” forming the unit in
     the grassy area centered on the flagstaff at the 436th Airlift Wing Headquarters. The first
     sergeant will then size and dress the unit ensuring dress, cover, interval and distance.
     Once achieved, the first sergeant will place the formation at “at ease.” At 1555, the first
     sergeant issues the command, “SQUADRON ATTENTION,” then “PARADE REST.”
     The squadron commander positions themselves at the entrance of Wing Safety Office and
     meets the Wing CC.
     3.16.2.2. After meeting the Wg/CC the squadron commander marches into position and
     takes control of the unit, assumes the position of Attention and orders the sounding of
     Retreat by commanding, “SOUND RETREAT.” The squadron commander then resumes
     the position of PARADE REST. NOTE: Music is coordinated through the 436 AW/CP.
     3.16.2.3. Once the Retreat music has ended, the squadron commander assumes the
     position of Attention, faces about or turns head at 90 degrees and commands,
     “SQUADRON, ATTENTION” followed by “PRESENT, ARMS.” After the command is
     executed the squadron commander faces about or faces forward (toward flagstaff) and
     executes Present Arms.
     3.16.2.4. When the last note of the National Anthem is played, or when the flag has been
     completely unfastened from the halyards (whichever occurs last) the squadron
     commander will execute Order Arms. The squadron commander will then face about or
     turn head at 90 degrees and commands “ORDER, ARMS.” Once again, the Squadron
     commander will face about or face forward (toward the flagstaff) and remain at
     Attention.
     3.16.2.5. Folding the flag takes from 3 to 5 minutes. After the flag has been folded the
     flag security detail will be reformed, marched to a position three paces from the squadron
     commander and halted (no arm swing when carrying the flag, turns should use the
     “wheel” movements). The NCOIC of the detail salutes the squadron commander and
     reports “Sir/Ma’am, the flag is secured.” The squadron commander returns the salute.
     3.16.2.6. Once the flag security detail has departed the area, the squadron commander
     will wait for the Wing leadership to come forward and say a few remarks then faces
     about and commands, “SQUADRON DISMISSED.”
  3.16.3. Flag Security Detail Responsibilities for a Formal Retreat Ceremony
     3.16.3.1. At 1550, the senior member (referred to as the NCOIC) ensures all members of
     the flag security detail are present. The detail forms up at a pre-designated location
     (436th Airlift Wing Safety Office entrance) facing the flagstaff.
     3.16.3.2. At 1555, the detail marches to the flagstaff and halts at a pre-designated
     position. The NCOIC commands “PARADE, REST.”
     3.16.3.3. Upon the first note of RETREAT, the halyard attendants of the flag detail
     assume the position of attention and move to the flagstaff to arrange the halyards for
     proper lowering of the flag. The senior halyard attendant unties the halyards, and both
DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                   43


     members grasp the halyards with both hands (arms bent at the elbows, forearms parallel
     to the ground, fist closed while grasping the halyards, palms facing the body, right hand
     over left at approximately chin level). Once in position, the senior halyard attendant
     commands “POST” (in the appropriate tone so that only the other halyard attendant
     responds) and both members take two 12-inch steps backwards in unison to pull the
     halyards taut.
     3.16.3.4. If the flag is at full staff position, the senior halyard attendant commands
     “PARADE, REST” (in the appropriate tone so that only the other halyard attendant
     responds) and both members simultaneously go to the position of Parade Rest. Once at
     Parade Rest, the halyards attendants will await the playing of the National Anthem.
     NOTE: Flag security detail members will inspect and prepare halyards prior to the
     ceremony to ensure the halyards can be properly handled during the sounding of Retreat.
     3.16.3.5. If the flag is at half-staff the halyards attendants will not go to Parade Rest, but
     will remain at the position of Attention and hoist the flag briskly to the staff head while
     Retreat is sounded and wait the playing of the National Anthem.
     3.16.3.6. Flag security detail members will execute the squadron commander’s command
     “SQUADRON, ATTENTION.” The NCOIC and the flag assistant will also execute
     “PRESENT, ARMS” on the squadron commander’s command. Halyard attendants grasp
     the halyards with both hands.
     3.16.3.7. On the first note of the National Anthem, the halyard attendants begin lowering
     the flag at a rate that coincides with the length of the National Anthem (approximately 60
     seconds). When the flag is within reach, the flag assistant will drop their salute, step
     forward, and grasp the free end of the flag to prevent it from touching the ground. Do not
     jump or stretch to reach the flag.
     3.16.3.8. The three (or five) members unfasten the flag and the flag assistant gathers it.
     3.16.3.9. The senior halyard attendant commands “POST” (in the appropriate tone so
     that only the other halyard attendant responds) and the halyard attendants step forward
     and secure the halyards to the flagstaff.
     3.16.3.10. The NCOIC will remain at Attention throughout the folding process unless
     needed to control the flag. During normal weather conditions, the NCOIC commands
     “POST,” and both halyard attendants simultaneously face away from the flagstaff. The
     halyard attendants, along with the flag assistant, simultaneously step off and halt in a pre-
     designated position for the folding of the flag. When the flag folding is complete, the
     junior member will cradle the flag against their chest with the middle point facing
     upward. The NCOIC of the flag detail will now give the command to “POST.” The
     NCOIC will do an about face and the flag bearer will step to the left of the NCOIC. Once
     complete the halyard attendants will move next to the flag bearer.
     3.16.3.11. The flag security NCOIC will give appropriate commands to march the detail
     to a position three paces from the squadron commander, halt the detail.
     3.16.3.12. The NCOIC will salute and report, “Sir/Ma’am, the Flag is secured.” The
     squadron commander returns the salute and the NCOIC marches the flag detail off,
     performing appropriate movements. When the flag detail passes the Wing Leadership
 44                                                  DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014


      while marching out, the Wing Leadership will salute the flag and show proper respects.
      No one from the flag detail will return this salute. After the flight is dismissed the flag
      detail will return to raise the flag. The NCOIC commands “DISMISSED” and the flag
      detail may disperse.
   3.16.4. Ceremonies Conducted Preceding the Formal Retreat Ceremony
      3.16.4.1. Commanders are encouraged to recognize their unit members preceding the
      retreat; recognition ceremonies include but are not limited to reenlistments, retirements,
      and promotions.
      3.16.4.2. Ceremonies are to be conducted prior to the retreat ceremony; the first sergeant
      will form the unit, time to form up will be determined by the squadron commander so as
      not to delay the retreat ceremony at 1600.
   3.16.5. For proper etiquette during Reveille and Retreat in places other than the installation
   flag pole, please refer to the table below:

3.17. Air Force Smart Operations for the 21 st Century (AFSO21) Training Requirements
   3.17.1. Dover AFB offers a variety of AFSO21 courses. Two introductory courses which
   are essential are: AFSO21 Awareness Training and 8-Step Problem Solving Method. These
   courses offer three to six hours of instruction in Lean principles and tools in addition to
   standardized reporting methods for process improvement and root cause analysis.
   3.17.2. The following is the training guidance for AFSO21:
      3.17.2.1. All 436 AW personnel (active duty and civilians) are required to attend the
      AFSO21 Awareness Training course.
DOVERAFBI36-2601 15 AUGUST 2014                                                                   45


      3.17.2.2. All 436 AW mid-level managers (Technical Sergeant and above) are required
      to attend the 8-Step Problem Solving Method course. In addition, this course is highly
      encouraged for all other personnel.
3.18. Funding Utilities for The Landings with Appropriated Funds
   3.18.1. Currently, the utilities for The Landings are shared between Non-Appropriated Funds
   (NAF) and Appropriated Funds, specifically, Operation and Maintenance (O&M). The split
   is 62% NAF and 38 % O&M base on a square foot allocation study completed on 23 July
   2013.
   3.18.2. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. §2494, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 65-106 paragraph 10.15
   and Attachment 2, and AFI 32-1061 paragraph 4.3.1.6, I am authorized to pay all utilities for
   Morale, Welfare and Recreation facilities with O&M funding, if available. The Landings is
   an important venue for Quality of Life events for our military community (i.e. Airman
   Leadership School, Group Award Luncheon, Squadron Commander’s Calls, etc.) and must
   continue to be a venue for these functions. It is also a venue for revenue generating private
   engagements (i.e. weddings, Spouse Club events).
   3.18.3. After reviewing the health of our Morale, Welfare and Recreation fund and the
   current O&M fiscal environment, the 436 AW/CC hereby chooses to create a fixed
   reimbursement cost share in excess of our required 38% O&M share. Effective 1 March
   2014, 75% of the utilities will be funded with O&M and the remaining 25% from NAF. This
   change will remain in effect indefinitely.
3.19. Delegation of Specific Installation Commander Duties
   3.19.1. To maintain efficiency and enhance mission effectiveness, the Wing Commander
   hereby delegates certain duties. These duties may be further delegated without Wing
   Commander specific authority where appropriate unless prohibited by appropriate
   regulations or instructions. This instruction rescinds all previous letters of delegation on the
   same subjects.
