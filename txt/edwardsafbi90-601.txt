This publication implements Air Force Material Command Instruction (AFMCI) 90-601, AFMC
Corporate Structure, and Air Force Test Center Instruction (AFTCI) 90-601, AFTC Corporate
Governance. This instruction outlines the 412th Test Wing (TW) Corporate Governance
Structure and establishes the 412 TW Council. It applies to all 412 TW units and organizations.
This publication may not be supplemented or further implemented/extended.                   Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Form 847 from field through the appropriate functional chain of command. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS). This instruction does not require tiers at or below the Wing level.


1. Objective. The primary objective of the corporate process is to provide the 412th Test
Wing Commander (412 TW/CC) with the capability to make decisions on Wing-wide issues
from a corporate perspective, with group commanders/directors and staff involvement. Issues,
recommendations, reports, policies, or initiatives with Wing-wide or significant resource
implications from committees, working groups, integrated process teams (IPTs), sub-boards, etc.,
will be brought directly to the 412 TW Council or through the appropriate board by the
owner/sponsor of the issue or process to the 412 TW Council. The scope of this instruction
 2                                              EDWARDSAFBI90-601 25 SEPTEMBER 2014


includes all efforts managed within the 412 TW. The process utilizes a corporate structure
comprised of 412 TW Boards and the 412 TW Council. Duties and responsibilities of the chairs,
members, and secretariat are set forth herein. This process is consistent with the HQ AFMC and
AFTC decision-making processes.
2. Procedures.
     2.1. The 412 TW corporate process is not a substitute for existing functional staffing
     processes; rather it funnels these activities through the appropriate integrated process to
     ensure that functional and/or potential Wing-wide issues are fully staffed and all
     perspectives addressed in developing recommended and alternative courses of action to
     support leadership decisions. There will continue to be functional process and reporting
     requirements that are handled within each functional area. On occasion, however, these
     functional requirements drive changes in resource allocations, expectations for the
     workforce, or have implications beyond simple functional boundaries. In addition, there will
     always be requests for Test Wing positions on numerous issues of interest to higher
     headquarters and required coordinated responses to taskings from the same. It is incumbent
     upon each group commander/director and staff organizations to continually assess their day-
     to-day actions in their functional area for potential broader implications and bring
     those items to the attention of the appropriate integrating board or council for
     consideration.
     2.2. The corporate process ensures the supporting and dissenting opinions for all major
     decisions are captured to enable Test Wing leadership to make informed decisions. It is not
     intended to supplant the functional staff, but to enhance it. The staff continues to conduct its
     functional reviews before entering the corporate process. The 412 TW corporate process will
     capitalize on the members' experience and knowledge of the Wing to enable open discussions
     and improved decisions not possible in customary staffing actions. Members represent their
     particular functional areas, but are also required to take Wing-wide (vice functional)
     perspectives in order to make corporate decisions.
     2.3. Figure 2.1. depicts the relationships between various bodies in a hierarchical
     framework. 412 TW Boards are the bedrock of the process and are used by the Group
     Commanders/Directors for management, resource and policy decisions within their
     respective areas. The 412 TW Council is the next level of the process, taking a senior level,
     enterprise-wide view of issues and is the decision-making entity. The 412 TW Council is the
     senior decision-making body in the 412 TW corporate process. 412 TW/CC retains final
     decision authority for corporate process issues, even if the Commander did not chair the
     meeting at which the issues were brought forward.

3. Responsibility and Authority.
   3.1. 412 TW Council. The Council serves as a forum for the TW/CC, with the advice of his
   group commanders/directors, to make informed decisions. The Council meets on a variety of
   topics that require the TW/CC to be the decision maker. The Council can meet as an AFMCI
   90-601, mandated council, for example, it can sit as the Civilian Employee Cost Management
   Council, the Facility Utilization Board, or the Environmental, Safety and Occupational
   Health Council depending on the topics to be covered. The council can sit as a non-
   mandated council for topics such as budget or investment plan approvals. For mandated
   councils, the appropriate sponsoring organization will be the OPR for meeting (in the above
   examples, 412TW/FSS and 412TW/CE respectively would be the council OPR).
      3.1.1. Responsibilities. The 412 TW Council serves as the senior decision-making body
      making corporate strategic decisions. The Council will make key decisions affecting
      strategic plans, organizations, missions, the use of real property facilities, fiscal and
      physical resources in support of the mission, Program Objective Memorandum (POM)
      inputs, rate development and review, annual workload negotiations, Installation and
      Resources Protection Program, and Wing-wide policies. Plans, programs, and budgets
      approved by the Council are final and will constitute the baseline documents to measure
      progress. The Council functions as the Financial Management Board for financial plans,
      unfunded requests, and financial execution status. The Council is responsible for
 4                                          EDWARDSAFBI90-601 25 SEPTEMBER 2014


      developing, implementing, and improving business practices, procedures, and policies;
      institutionalizing and documenting processes; business inspections, reviews, and audits as
      required. The Council provides leadership and oversight (where appropriate) of the
      Program Management Reviews, CARA (Capability Analysis and Risk Assessment)
      Process, AFSO21 (Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century) Process, and others
      as designated.
      3.1.2. Membership.
         3.1.2.1. The 412 TW Council is chaired by 412 TW/CC or in the Commandersâ€™
         absence by the 412 TW/CV. Other members of the 412 TW Council are the 412
         TW/ID, 412 TW/CT, 412 OG/CC, 412 MXG/CC, 412 MDG/CC, 412 TENG/CL, 412
         EWG/CC, 412 MSG/CC, 412 CE/CL, 412 TMG/CL, 412 TW/XP, 412 TW/FM, 412

         3.1.2.2. 412 TW Council members, if present for duty, will attend scheduled
         meetings, as consistency is the key for successful and timely deliberations. During
         absences, the designated first or second alternate member (usually the deputy or
EDWARDSAFBI90-601 25 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                          5


         technical director) will attend in his/her place. The members are responsible for
         ensuring appropriate advisors from their organizations are present.
     3.1.3. Administrative. The organization sponsoring the Council meeting will act as the
     secretariat. When no sponsoring org is identified, the Plans and Programs Office (412
     TW/XP) will act as secretariat. The secretariat will assist in scheduling meetings,
     submitting read-ahead documents, and tracking action items, as directed by the
     chairperson. If an emergency meeting is needed, 412 TW/XP will schedule an out-of-
     cycle meeting to address the issue at hand.
         3.1.3.1. For complex topics or as directed by the Chairperson, the sponsoring
         organization will develop the minutes capturing deliberations on their issue and send
         them to the Council member in their reporting chain for review. Subsequently, the
         sponsoring organization will send the draft minutes to the Secretariat who will review
         them for completeness. Once satisfied, the Secretariat will then forward the minutes
         to the Chairperson for review and approval.
     3.1.4. Approval/Authority. The 412 TW Council Chairperson is the decision authority.
     3.1.5. Frequency. The 412 TW Council will meet twice monthly on a regular schedule.
     The Council Secretariat will notify all 412 TW Council members if the meeting is
     cancelled, moved, or rescheduled. The location of each meeting will be the 412 TW
     conference room (B2750, CR 310) unless members are notified otherwise.
     3.1.6. Electronic Announcements. Initial notification of meetings, briefings and other
     412 TW Council communication activity will be posted in the 412 TW Council folder in
     SharePoint. Copies of briefings and minutes will be posted unless material is deemed
     sensitive or otherwise not appropriate for posting. In these cases, material will be
     distributed through other means.
  3.2. Committees or Special Purpose Working Groups may be established at the direction of
  the Council.
