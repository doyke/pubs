SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Many items have been
relocated throughout the instruction for better grouping of integrated functions. This change
incorporates guidance on Precision Loading (PL) and Nuclear Weapons-Related Materials (NWRM)
procedures, cargo processing times, properly restraining palletized cargo on K-loaders using the
Patriot Method, grid/bay location requirements for non-Transportation Working Capital Fund
(TWCF) generating aerial ports, revision of Security Cage/Room access requirements, revision of
Radioactive Material requirements, and addition of AMC Aerial Port Expediter (APEX) Program;
replaced NGSL & Next Generation Small Loader with Halvorsen Loader; K-Loader refers to Tunner,
Halvorsen & “Older Generation” K-Loaders (25K’s). Revises Transportation Discrepancy Report
(TDR) procedures, to include use of Global Freight Management (GFM) Discrepancy Identification
System (DIS) to supplement notifications of discrepant cargo. Revised aerial port/air terminal
cargo/mail inventory actions. Modified the requirements for quality control checks of intransit cargo.
Initiates AMC Form 428, AMC Intransit Transportation Protection Services (TPS) Worksheet, as
Attachment 7 and the Traffic Management Process for TPS Shipments at Para 40.9 Added
ERO/Load Team Chief guidelines/checklists and TP-4 Generation Points as attachments within this
volume. Removed guidance on Aerial Port Equipment and Pallet and Nets, now located in AMCI
24-101, Volume 13.

Section A—General Requirements for Cargo/Mail Movement

1. Scope. This volume contains procedures and guidance designed to control and monitor
movement of cargo/mail throughout the AMC airlift system. These procedures apply to all
AMC operated air terminals and Aerial Ports of Debarkation (APOD)/Embarkation (APOE),
including those supporting deployed operations. Global Air Transportation Execution System
(GATES) capable stations will comply with detailed instructions in the system users’ manuals.
GATES users’ manuals provide technical reference for GATES system use and do not establish
cargo movement policy or guidance.
   1.1. Automated documentation methods may supersede manual methods in this volume as
   long as the automated method captures and maintains the same information. For example, if
   a GATES/automated report has the same information as a manual report, the automated
   report should be used in lieu of the manual report. Similarly, if an automated system
   generates the same information as a required form, then a printout of that information can be
   kept with or in lieu of the form. In all cases, before relying on automated products to replace
   requirements stated in this volume, consult with Headquarters Air Mobility Command, Cargo
   and Traffic Management Branch (HQ AMC/A4TC) for guidance.
2. Cargo/Mail Air Transportation Eligibility. Only cargo/mail authorized movement in
accordance with (IAW) Department of Defense (DOD) 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility
and this volume will be moved on AMC aircraft.
3. Department of Defense Supply Chain Material Management Regulation. DOD 4140.1-
R, DOD Supply Chain Material Management Regulation, lists DOD system of supply and
transportation priorities. (DOD 4000.25-1-M, Military Standard Requistioning and Issue
Procedures, is issued under the authority of DOD Directive 4140.1 and prescribes uniform
procedures, data elements and codes, formats, forms, and time standards for use in automated
and manual data processing.)
   3.1. Processing Goals:
       3.1.1. All import and export cargo/mail will be processed as soon as possible, but will
       not exceed 6 hours of receipt time.
       3.1.2. AMC Mission Capable/Mission Capability (MICAP)/Very, Very Important Parts
       (VVIP) will be processed immediately for onward movement. When releasing to
       consignee activities/personnel, AMC MICAP/VVIP will be available to release within 30
       minutes.
4. Shippers Responsibilities. Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR), Part II, Cargo
Movement, procedures are designed to record the movement and establish uniform handling of
cargo/mail throughout the Defense Transportation System (DTS). Shippers are responsible to
ensure all cargo/mail tendered to AMC, is packed, marked, labeled, and documented IAW the
DTR Part II and other applicable directives. Note: Specialized shoring for cargo shipments is
the shipper’s responsibility.
 8                                                      AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


5. Deferred Air Freight Shipments (TP-3/TP-4 Cargo Rates).
     5.1. Transportation Priority (TP)-3 Shipments are air eligible. The shipper determines if the
     shipment requires TP-1, TP-2, or routine transportation TP-3. Although DTR part II, Table
     203-3 “recommends” TP-3 for surface transportation modes the shipper may elect air as the
     mode, if warranted. Aerial ports will accept TP-3 cargo which has been cleared into the
     airlift system by the appropriate Airlift Clearance Authority/Customer Service Branch
     (ACA/CSB). If the cargo has not been cleared into the airlift system, it will be frustrated
     back to the appropriate ACA/CSB for clearance IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter 203. TP-3 cargo
     will be moved in the same manner as TP-1 and TP-2, IAW destination, priority, and System
     Entry Time (SET). IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter 203, Paragraph B.3., TP-4 cargo is non-air
     eligible cargo that would otherwise move by surface, at surface billing rates. TP-4 rates are
     developed for uniquely identifiable commodities that do not create an additional wartime
     movement dependency on airlift when moved in peacetime using excess by-product
     capability. Charges for carrying deferred air freight (TP-4 cargo) are assessed on a per cubic
     foot basis versus actual weight. All non-air eligible freight and certain retrograde reparable
     cargo may be moved as filler cargo within the deferred air service capability offered. Air-
     eligible TP-1 and TP-2 cargo will not be moved as TP-4. Hazardous materials (HAZMAT)
     or shipments requiring special handling will not be accepted as deferred air freight without
     the shipper or shipper’s representative coordinating prior approval with the air terminal
     manager (ATM). The ATM will be responsible for completing the coordination process with
     applicable down-line stations to ensure special handling capacity or capabilities are not
     exceeded. Any issues that cannot be worked between the shipper(s) and ATM(s) will be
     coordinated through HQ AMC/A4TC prior to movement. The applicability of the TP-4 rates
     is subject to the availability and allocation of space. Specific rates can be found at the
     following website: https://ww2.ustranscom.mil/doing_business.cfm or by contacting
     USTRANSCOM/J8 at USTC-Rates@ustranscom.mil.
     5.2. TP-4 Generation Points. Continental United States (CONUS), primary, secondary and
     hard lift areas are determined by HQ AMC/A4TC, in coordination with 618 Air Operations
     Center (AOC)/Global Channel Operations (XOG). CONUS and primary generation points
     are listed with their respective secondary OCONUS generation points in Attachment 11 of
     this volume and on the A4TC website (located under Cargo Policy, Tools & Resources)
     https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/AFP40/d/1074111948/Files/a4t/a4tc/cargo/tools/
     hello.html.
        5.2.1. TP-4 CONUS Generation Points (CGP). These are CONUS terminals where
        AMC airlift originates and transits overseas terminals. CONUS air terminals are
        authorized to maintain acceptable TP-4 on-hand levels up to their projected capability.
        5.2.2. TP-4 Primary Outside Contiguous United States (OCONUS) Generation Points
        (POGP). These are overseas terminals where missions originate, transit and return to
        CONUS. POGP terminals are authorized to maintain acceptable TP-4 on-hand levels up
        to their projected capability.
        5.2.3. TP-4 Secondary OCONUS Generation Points (SOGP) Cat I. These overseas
        terminals are authorized to maintain acceptable TP-4 on-hand levels up to their
        allocation, but must coordinate with the POGP load planning prior to movement. This
        coordination ensures higher priority cargo will not preclude direct movement to CONUS
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  9


      APOD. Movement of intra-theater TP-4 cargo is authorized to the next down line station.
      However, if transshipment is required at the next down line station, the originating station
      must get approval from the in-transit station(s).
      5.2.4. TP-4 Secondary OCONUS Generation Points SOGP Cat II. SOGP air freight
      officers are encouraged to generate TP-4 shipments, but must get authorization from their
      respective POGP air terminal on a shipment by shipment basis.
      5.2.5. TP-4 Hard lift Area. These overseas terminals have no scheduled organic or
      commercial air service. Designated hard lift areas will not accept TP-4 cargo for
      movement.
   5.3. Port Responsibilities.      The air freight officer/superintendent (or designated
   representative, when assigned) at the CGP and POGP will establish acceptable on-hand TP-4
   levels based upon the excess space estimates, port processing constraints, historical airlift
   utilization, and known future uncommitted space. The air freight officer/superintendent will
   also, in coordination with the Customer Service Branch (CSB) or Airlift Clearance Authority
   (ACA), develop a clearance plan to control the flow of TP-4 shipments into the port. TP-4
   will not be allowed to free-flow into the port. The air freight officer/superintendent must
   ensure movement capability exists to the final APOD.
      5.3.1. Outsized and oversized TP-4 cargo is accepted on a shipment-by-shipment basis.
   5.4. Use TP-4 cargo to maximize aircraft utilization. AMC will attempt to move TP-4
   meeting TP-3 Uniform Material Movement and Issue Priority System (UMMIPS) time
   standards. TP-4 cargo will be maintained on hand for a maximum of 20 calendar days. If
   movement has not occurred at the end of 20 days, the cargo will be frustrated and the air
   freight officer/superintendent and ACA/CSB will coordinate with the shipper to divert TP-4
   cargo to other transportation modes, or to upgrade to TP-2. During contingencies and peak
   workload periods, the air freight officer/superintendent will close the port to TP-4 cargo, as
   necessary, to ensure higher priority, air eligible cargo movement is not delayed. Note: No
   TP-4 will be held for more than 24 days total. This accounts for the eventuality that the 20th
   day falls on a weekend/holiday.
6. Associated Aerial Port Equipment.
   6.1. Active RFID (aRFID) Tag/Battery Levels. Each aerial port will maintain a minimum
   stock level quantity of aRFID tags and batteries. This stock level is based on the port’s
   historical rate of pallets built during the past 6 months and should sustain the port for 60
   days. When tags are stored, reverse the tag battery in its compartment to “turn off” the tag.
   aRFID tag write procedures are covered in paragraph 29.
   6.2. Pallet Plastic Covers/Dunnage/Shoring. Air Freight is responsible for maintaining an
   adequate stock level of pallet plastic covers and dunnage. This stock level is for Air Freight
   AMC pallets, and does not include unit movement/mobility pallets. Serviceable plastic
   covers from terminating cargo will be reused. Air Freight is responsible for maintaining
   shoring kits IAW paragraph 97.
   6.3. Scale Calibration. Scales will be calibrated IAW TO 00-20-14, Air Force Metrology
   and Calibration Program. If guidance does not apply to your scales, then scale calibrations
   will not exceed 180 days. When the scale calibration period has elapsed and/or the scale is
10                                                    AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


  inoperative, placard it with an Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 350, Repairable
  Item Processing Tag, IAW Technical Order (TO) 00-20-2. For calibration or repair, turn-in
  the equipment to the base Precision Measurements Equipment Laboratory (PMEL). Note:
  For more detailed information on Aerial Port Equipment, see Air Mobility Command
  Instruction (AMCI) 24-101, Volume 13.
  6.4. Pallets, Nets, Tie-down equipment, and RFID Tag Control and Accountability: (Not
  applicable to ANG and AFRC)
     6.4.1. General. Each AMC unit appoints a pallet/net and tie-down equipment manager
     IAW DOD 4500.9-R-1, Part VI.
         6.4.1.1. The unit pallet/net and tie-down equipment manager is responsible for
         accounting for, issuing, and controlling pallets, nets, tie-down chains, straps, devices,
         pallet couplers, RFID tags and nuclear shoring kits.
     6.4.2. Procedures. The home station Ramp Services tie-down representative prepares the
     AF Form 4069, Tie-down Equipment Checklist, for tie-down equipment issued to each
     home station aircraft.
         6.4.2.1. Before aircraft departure from home station, the ramp services tie-down crew
         representative initiates an AF Form 4069, then inventories and issues all tie-down
         equipment to comply with the appropriate aircraft configuration or mission directives.
         The original copy, which accompanies the aircraft, is placed in a protective folder
         (red press-wood binder type folder, NSN 7530-00-634-1795, is recommended for
         use). This is to increase visibility of the AF Form 4069 and reduce the possibility of
         the forms being disposed of as trash. If these folders are not immediately available,
         any folder with prong fasteners can be used. Stencil "AF Form 4069" in bold print on
         both sides of the folder for increased visibility. The tie-down crew representative will
         ensure sufficient copies are prepared for each en route station. AF Forms 4069 are
         not required for training missions scheduled to depart from and return to home station
         without an interim stop.
         6.4.2.2. The loadmaster/boom operator inventories the tie-down equipment and
         ensures the quantities on hand are sufficient for the mission. The unit pallet/net and
         tie-down equipment manager maintains a copy (dispose of IAW AF Records
         Disposition Schedule available on-line at https://afrims.amc.af.mil ).
         6.4.2.3. The ramp service tie-down representative will perform a one-for-one
         exchange of tie-down equipment for channel airlift missions.                     For
         Contingency/SAAM type missions, the deploying units must provide the tie-down
         equipment for restraint of their pallets. If a one-for-one exchange is not possible,
         annotate the AF Form 4069, Part III, with the amount of tie-down equipment issued
         and the reason. The tie-down representative maintains a copy of this form in station
         files.
         6.4.2.4. At en route stations tie-down representatives will annotate AF Form 4069
         upon aircraft arrival/departure. In the absence of an AF Form 4069, the en route
         station will generate one based on arrival tie-down inventory and annotate “Issued by
         XXX” (station code) at the top of the form. Note: If there are no air transportation
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              11


        requirements at the aircraft, then there is no requirement to annotate the AF Form
        4069.
            6.4.2.4.1. The ramp services tie-down representative meets all AMC transport
            aircraft upon arrival at home station, and inventories tie-down equipment. Enter
            the amount of each type of tie-down equipment on the aircraft in the termination
            check column of the AF Form 4069. Compare the station file copy of AF Form
            4069 with the aircraft copy to determine missing/lost equipment.            The
            loadmaster/boom operator makes a written statement, if required. Air freight
            takes appropriate action for lost tie-down equipment IAW AFMAN 23-220,
            Report of Survey for Air Force Property and AFI 23-111, Management of
            Government Property in Possession of the Air Force.
            6.4.2.4.2. Treat AMC aircraft temporarily based at an en route station like home
            station aircraft for the duration of their assignment. Maintain their tie-down
            inventory at the same level as when they first arrived. Copies of the AF Form
            4069 will be completed and maintained by the Ramp Services tie-down monitor.
        6.4.2.5. Issuing tie-down equipment to other-than-AMC aircraft:
            6.4.2.5.1. Ramp services tie-down personnel are responsible for issuing tie-down
            equipment to other-than-AMC aircraft, using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue
            Receipt.
            6.4.2.5.2. Prepare the AF Form 1297 in duplicate. Print the name, organization
            and location of the individual who signs for the tie-down equipment legibly on the
            form. Annotate the following statement on the AF Form 1297: "Tie-down
            equipment will be returned to issuing station within 30 days." The original copy
            of the AF Form 1297 is kept by the flight crew and the duplicate copy is
            maintained by the unit pallet/net and tie-down equipment manager for future
            reference (dispose of IAW AF Records Disposition Schedule available on-line at
            https://afrims.amc.af.mil).
        6.4.2.6. Issuance of pallets, nets, tie-down equipment and dunnage to other activities:
            6.4.2.6.1. Record pallets, nets and tie-down equipment issued to other activities
            on the unit pallet, net and tie-down log at time of issue and return.
     6.4.3. Inventory pallet, net, RFID tag, and tie-down equipment assets as required, and
     submit a weekly inventory report to HQ AMC/A4TE (pallet/net and tie-down equipment
     manager) using the HQ AMC-A4TE (W&AR) 8001, AMC Key Asset and Equipment
     Report.
        6.4.3.1. Equipment authorization levels are determined by the historical workload or
        wartime requirements, and are reflected on the 8001 report. Note: Waiver to
        decrease these established minimum levels must be approved by HQ AMC/A4TR.
        However, units may increase these levels, with A4TR concurrence, if consumption
        experience indicates they are inadequate.
     6.4.4. Subfloor and tie-down on commercial aircraft.
        6.4.4.1. AMC will provide 463L pallets, chains, devices, and couplers when
        commercial aircraft are used to move rolling stock. Couplers will only be provided if
 12                                                   AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


          needed to couple pallets together as a subfloor. The deploying unit will provide
          pallets, tie-down, and couplers for cargo that is not intended to be loaded as rolling
          stock.
7. Rehandled Cargo/Mail. Rehandled cargo/mail is defined as that amount of cargo/mail that
must be rehandled due to a requirement change outside the control of the air terminal. This may
occur in one or a series of categories.
   7.1. Instructions for completion of the AMC Form 56, Rehandled Workload, can be located
   in AMCI 24-101, Volume 6, Transportation Documentation, Data Records, and Reports.
       7.1.1. Air Freight. When cargo is rehandled, the affected work center's control function
       completes the AMC Form 56, as appropriate, to reflect this additional workload.
       Examples include aborts, delays, cancellations, reroutes, or aircraft swaps that result in
       re-accomplishing of any one of the Air Freight functions listed on the AMC Form 56.
       Air Freight fills out the form for the following reasons:
          7.1.1.1. Cargo is bumped from a flight.
          7.1.1.2. A properly load planned load is re-sequenced to meet loadmaster/boom
          operator approval (one reprocess).
              7.1.1.2.1. A load plan is re-accomplished (one re-handle per re-accomplished
              load plan).
          7.1.1.3. Cargo is transferred from one aircraft to another (one offload and one
          onload).
          7.1.1.4. Cargo is downloaded from a cancelled mission (one download. Account for
          upload on AMC Form 56 only if not accounted for on AMC Form 77, Aircraft
          Ground Handling Record, or AMC Form 68, Aerial Port Movement Log).
          7.1.1.5. Pallets are reconfigured due to Opportune Airlift (one reprocess).
          7.1.1.6. Cargo is frustrated to ACA/CSB (one reprocess).
          7.1.1.7. A cargo load is switched (one offload and one onload).
          7.1.1.8. Loads are returned to storage locations after mission changes (one
          reprocess).
          7.1.1.9. Pre-built pallets (e.g., Air Lines Of Communication (ALOC), NAVCON,
          Code J) arrived improperly configured and are reconfigured by aerial port personnel.
          Note: Tightening pallet nets and/or straps are not considered re-handling. Nets and
          straps naturally loosen due to cargo shifting during transport.
          7.1.1.10. Cargo requiring re-icing more than one time. First re-icing is considered
          normal business practice; however, if cargo remains at any port long enough to
          require additional re-icing, each additional re-icing counts as one reprocess.
   7.2. Completing the AMC Form 56.
       7.2.1. Authentication (Signed): Requires a review/validation and signature of the
       appropriate OIC/Superintendent of ATOC and Air Freight for re-handled aircraft
       workload.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                      13

       7.2.6. Cargo rehandled: This section applies only to work centers within the Air Freight
       function. Complete as follows using gross weights throughout:
             7.2.6.1. Pounds Offloaded: Enter the gross weight of cargo offloaded.
             7.2.6.2. Pounds Onloaded: Enter the gross weight of cargo onloaded.
             7.2.6.3. Pounds Reprocessed: Enter the gross weight of cargo reprocessed (e.g. new
             load sequence, pallet reconfiguration, frustrated cargo, etc.). Note: You must
             physically work the aircraft, i.e., re-handle the cargo, mail, baggage, or re-process, re-
             transport passengers, to take credit for any re-handled workload. See AMCI 24-101,
             Vol. 6 for detailed explanation of what qualifies as re-handled workload.

Section B—: Safety, Security and Mishap Prevention

8. Safety.
   8.1. Explosives Safety. Comply with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 91-201, Explosives
   Safety Standards, and host base implementation requirements during operations involving
   aircraft on/offload, transportation and intransit storage of explosives.
       8.1.1. Personnel whose duties involve contact with explosives will receive initial
       explosive safety training (using an AFMAN 91-202, U.S. Air Force Mishap Prevention
       Program, compliant and host base approved lesson plan) and must have recurring
       training every 15 months IAW AFMAN 91-202. Record this training IAW Air Force
       Instruction (AFI) 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, AFI 36-401, Employee Training
       and Development, and local procedures.
       8.1.2. Ensure vehicles are inspected and equipment operators are trained to transport and
       handle explosives IAW AFMAN 91-201.
       8.1.3. Do not use forklifts to transport explosives in over-the-road type operations or out
       of the immediate work area.
       8.1.4. Pallets, skids or individual containers of explosives will be secured (utilizing
       straps or chains, as necessary) to forklifts to prevent dropping. Secure stacked pallets,
       skids or containers of explosives prior to movement.
       8.1.5. Ensure locally written instructions are developed, coordinated with installation
       Weapons Safety, and utilized IAW AFMAN 91-201, paragraphs 7.2 & 7.3, for all
       explosive operations.
14                                                    AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


  8.2. Industrial Safety. Terminal personnel will comply with 91-series Safety AFIs
  (http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_se/publication/afi91-202/afi91-202.pdf
  or http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_se/publication/afi91-203/afi91-203.pdf)
  and host base implementation requirements. As a minimum, use the following standards
  when establishing a terminal safety program:
     8.2.1. AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction.
     8.2.2. Develop local checklist(s) using relevant safety guidance found in AFI 91-203 to
     brief personnel on hazards associated with air terminal and flight line operations. The
     following are specific requirements applicable to cargo operations:
         8.2.2.1. During periods of low visibility or darkness, personnel who work on the
         flight line or in the vicinity of vehicle traffic must wear either an approved reflective
         vest or reflective material.
         8.2.2.2. Do not wear rings or any other jewelry, which may become snagged, while
         performing cargo handling duties. The wearing of gloves does not negate the
         requirement to remove rings/jewelry.
         8.2.2.3. Personnel will wear approved/appropriate noise suppression devices when
         performing duties in hazardous noise areas.
         8.2.2.4. Personnel will ensure all appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is
         available and properly used.
  8.3. Equipment/Vehicle Safety. Equipment/vehicle operators and spotters will use the
  universal aircraft loading signals IAW AFMAN 24-306_IP, Manual for the Wheeled
  Operator. Additionally, appropriate hand signals for forklift, k-loaders and general spotting
  may be found on the Standardization, Programs and Resources (HQ AMC/A4TR) website
  under Quality Training Package (QTP) Module 14.4 (https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
  af/USAF/AFP40/d/1074111948/Files/a4t/a4tr/atsev/qtp_2012/14/hello.html).
     8.3.1. Care should be given to ensure loads are not damaged and personnel are not
     injured when transporting cargo in vehicles/trucks.
     8.3.2. Forklift operations. Supplemental restraint (chains or straps) will be used to
     secure cargo to the forklift mast frame when using rollerized tines to load/offload or
     transport pallets.
         8.3.2.1. Unstable or irregular shaped objects (lacking perfect symmetry, evenness, or
         balance, e.g. “flat”) will be secured to the forklift mast frame (straps or chains may be
         used) before being raised, lowered, or moved. Place large irregularly shaped objects
         on pallets for stability before transporting, when possible.
         8.3.2.2. Use of approved pintle hook attachment. (Caterpillar Hitch Assembly)
             8.3.2.2.1. Procure attachments directly through Caterpillar.
             8.3.2.2.2. Part #: 378-7975 with nomenclature "Hitch Assembly"
             8.3.2.2.3. Go to www.cat.com <http://www.cat.com> and select "Find Dealer"
             to find the dealer nearest you. OCONUS locations may have to use the same
             process their local maintenance shop does to order Caterpillar parts. Contact
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               15


            information is also listed in the back of the Caterpillar forklift manuals.
            8.3.2.2.4. Each pintle hook attachment will be delivered with supplemental
            documentation for operator manuals and/or vehicle TOs.
            8.3.2.2.5. New attachment capability: 3K lb Tongue Weight and 20K lb Gross
            Trailer Weight.
            8.3.2.2.6. Per AMC/SEG and the AFSC, the technical data provided by
            Caterpillar satisfies the manufacturer designation requirement for loading and
            unloading operations with the Caterpillar 10K A/T and the new ALFA
            attachment. Note: This attachment and technical data applies to Caterpillar
            models only. Note: Trailer mounted engines are strictly prohibited from
            lifting/movement using forklift tines during any on-load/off-load operations.
            Take precautions to ensure protruding engine parts (after-burners, engine blades,
            etc.) are not damaged during transport. Consult appropriate section of TO 00-85-
            20, Engine Shipping Instructions, if necessary.
     8.3.3. K-loader operations.
        8.3.3.1. K-loaders are designed to carry only the operator. When the vehicle is in
        active motion (travel/transport mode), never let anyone else ride on the vehicle.
        During lift/lower motions (elevator mode) load crew personnel (maximum of 2) may
        remain on the K-loader deck to expedite cargo transfer/loading and/or provide
        clearance spotting where appropriate, e.g. 747 side loading operations. Personnel
        must be visible on the left side catwalk (in operator’s view), and stay clear of the
        ladder and extreme ends of the deck (past the final pallet lock/yellow caution line).
        8.3.3.2. Fall Prevention. Efforts to prevent falls must be paramount at all times, but
        especially during aircraft loading/unloading operations. All available measures, both
        passive and active, must be used to ensure safe conditions for all personnel.
        Personnel must be briefed by the load team chief on all safety-related concerns and
        conditions which may exist during the operation. The briefing will include any areas
        identified as having increased fall potential to ensure heightened awareness.
        Personnel must pay close attention to and remain aware of all visual cues, e.g. yellow
        caution lines, chain gates, etc., in place to prevent falls.
        8.3.3.3. Fall Restraint. A fall restraint harness must be worn when working past the
        last pallet lock/yellow caution line on either end of the K-Loader deck when the deck
        is extended. During active loading activities, when the K-Loader is in final
        loading/unloading position, this requirement does not pertain to the transfer area
        between the loader and aircraft. However, again, heightened awareness should be
        given to areas with increased fall potential.
        8.3.3.4. Operators are responsible for properly restraining palletized cargo on K-
        loaders prior to movement to include engaging the pallet stops. When necessary for
        the operator to remain in the cab of the K-loader, the loading supervisor is responsible
        for ensuring compliance.
        8.3.3.5. 25K- and 40K-loaders. Engage all pallet rail guide locks for each pallet and
        raise both emergency pallet stops. Apply supplemental restraint using 10,000 lb
16                                                AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


     chains and devices or HQ AMC-approved restraint to the fore and aft pallet (both
     sides of pallet). If pallets are loaded in a logistics configuration, secure the first and
     last pallet with two 10,000 lbs chains and devices or HQ AMC-approved restraint.
     Secure the middle pallets with 5,000 lbs straps restricting movement in all directions
     (bellyband).
     8.3.3.6. Halvorsen/Tunner Loaders. Engage all pallet rail guide locks for each pallet
     and engage both pallet stops. If pallets are loaded in a logistics configuration, secure
     the first and last pallet with two 10,000 lbs chains and devices or HQ AMC-approved
     restraint. Secure the middle pallets with 5,000 lbs straps restricting movement in all
     directions (bellyband). Apply supplemental restraint by using 10,000 lb chains or HQ
     AMC-approved restraint to the fore and aft pallets when pallets are locked into only
     one rail guide lock. Note: Supplemental restraint is not required for the Halvorsen
     and Tunner loaders when the pallet rail guide locks are engaged on both sides of all
     pallets. Review the following website for more information on logistics configuration
     (Patriot Method): https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/AFP40/d/1074111948/Files/
     a4t/a4tr/atsev/hello.html.
     8.3.3.7. Do not use the K-loader pallet stop as the primary pallet restraint. The K-
     loader pallet stop is a back-up in case the primary pallet restraint fails. When tie-
     down chains are used for supplemental restraints, the device or chains will be
     attached to the pallet D-rings. Note: Do not overload tie-down rings on K-loader
     decks. Limit maximum restraint per tie-down point to 5,000 lbs. WARNING:
     Secure all strap/chain loose ends to prevent tangling in the K-loader wheels and/or
     catwalk damage.
     8.3.3.8. K-loaders must approach aircraft outside the circle of safety in travel mode
     to avoid damage to the loader. Preliminary adjustments, such as switching 60K
     suspension travel mode to load mode, must be made prior to entering the aircraft
     circle of safety. The K-loader will be maneuvered with the deck in the raised position
     with suspension fully lowered only for final alignment during loading/unloading
     operations. Always ensure special attention to aircraft wing and fuselage clearances.
     8.3.3.9. Limit access of personnel on elevated loader to left side catwalk (in
     operator’s view), to minimize hazard to any additional personnel on the K-loader, not
     in view of the operator.
     8.3.3.10. During K-loaders bridging operations maintain a 6-8 inch gap between the
     loaders.
        8.3.3.10.1. Engage at least one lock on the left side of all pallets during elevator
        operations.
        8.3.3.10.2. On K-loaders with powered conveyors (Tunner and Halvorsen) all
        pallets may be unlocked and moved together when transferring to a second loader.
        This will only be permitted in lowered (under 10 ft) position. A spotter
        positioned on the left catwalk will monitor transfer of pallets from elevator to
        second loader and provide guidance to stop operation in case of any problem with
        a jammed pallet or safety concern.
        8.3.3.10.3. Avoid bridging K-loaders during rolling stock operations. If you
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 17


              must, conduct a Risk Assessment to identify potential hazards and procedures to
              be followed in accordance with AFI 91-202. (See AFI 91-202, Attach 15)
              8.3.3.10.4. During concurrent servicing operations, ensure compliance with TO
              00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding,
              specifically paragraph 5-9d. Ensure all appropriate safety issues and clearances
              are considered.
          8.3.3.11. Reference Attachment 2 for the Tunner/K-loader Parking and Traffic Flow
          Plan.
          8.3.3.12. Operators will ensure all pallets are locked in place prior to initiating
          transport to on/off loading operations. During active aircraft loading, only unlock the
          pallet that will be moved from the K-loader to the aircraft, keeping the others locked
          in place to prevent moving. During active aircraft offloading, ensure each pallet is
          locked into place prior to moving another pallet onto the deck of the K-loader.
          8.3.3.13. When loading cargo onto the K-loader with a forklift ensure each pallet on
          the K-loader is locked in place and pallet stops are engaged in the up position prior to
          pulling the forklift away from the K-loader.
          8.3.3.14. When offloading a K-loader with a forklift ensure each pallet on the K-
          loader remains locked in place until the forklift is properly positioned to offload the
          pallet. Additionally, all pallets remaining on the K-loader will be locked in place
          during offloading operations. Ensure pallet stops are engaged in the up position prior
          to pulling the forklift away from the K-loader.
          8.3.3.15. Gravity movement of palletized cargo on K-loaders is prohibited. The on-
          loading/off-loading of a knelt C-5 aircraft does not constitute gravity movement as
          long as the cargo movement is controlled. Note: Pallet stops will not be altered or
          tampered with during on/offloading operations.
9. Security of Cargo and Mail.
   9.1. AMC is charged with providing adequate security and protection for all cargo/mail in
   the airlift system from time of acceptance until time of release. Cargo/Mail that requires
   security above the aerial ports capability will be the shipper’s responsibility.
      9.1.1. For both safety and security purposes access to air freight terminals, related work
      areas, and grid yards should be limited, as much as possible, to aerial port personnel. In
      facilities where authorized visitors need to transit the industrial area, clearly marked
      visitor access lanes, entry doors, etc… should be used to safely route visiting personnel.
      Visitor escorts are at the discretion of Aerial Port leadership.
   9.2. Cargo Security. Cargo/mail must be protected against loss, damage, pilferage, and
   inclement weather. Establish resource protection and general cargo security as outlined in
   AFI 31-101, AMC Sup 1, Integrated Defense, and the Integrated Defense Plan (IDP).
   Overseas terminals are responsible for providing a sterile area for shipments destined to US
   possessions IAW DTR, Part V, Department of Defense Customs and Border Clearance
   Policies and Procedures.
      9.2.1. Provide temporary in-transit cargo storage at air freight terminals/cargo processing
      facilities. If cargo security cages or rooms used for temporary storage of classified
18                                                   AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


     material have an intrusion detection alarm operating when attendants are not present. In-
     transit classified cargo maybe temporarily stored/intermingled with other in-transit cargo
     at air freight terminal/cargo processing facilities while awaiting transport or during
     stopovers prior to reaching its final destination. Servicing CIPs will certify these cargo
     areas prior to use.
     9.2.2. Status of Shipment Requests. Direct inquiries concerning shipment status from
     non-AMC transportation personnel to the ACA, CSB, Liaison Officer (LNO) or Traffic
     Management Office (TMO), IAW DTR, Part II and AFI 24-203, Preparation and
     Movement of Air Force Cargo.
  9.3. Mail Security. Registered mail may contain up to and including SECRET material;
  therefore, always protect, safeguard and handle as classified cargo. Detailed guidance for
  registered mail handling and accountability is outlined in paragraph 44 of this volume. Note:
  Only US military or US civilians with appropriate security clearance may sign for and take
  custody of classified shipments.
     9.3.1. When registered mail is in the custody of Air Freight, it is to be secured IAW
     DODM 5200.01-V3, DoD Information Security Program: Protection of Classified
     Information . When this requirement cannot be met, post a US citizen employee to
     protect registered mail (need not be armed).
     9.3.2. Registered mail and classified cargo (special handling codes 5, 6, 8, c, and s)
     should be moved via U.S. military aircraft whenever possible. However, registered mail
     and classified cargo may be transferred to an AMC contract air carrier without flight deck
     (pilot and copilot) aircrew members providing documentation of a security clearance if
     the individual signing for the cargo is a U.S. citizen (having in possession a U.S. issued
     passport).
     9.3.3. AMC’s ability to move signature service cargo on Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF)
     missions is one of the most critical aspects of the service the command provides.
     Therefore, both the Government and the CRAF carrier share responsibility, prior to
     transfer, to identify any issues that could prevent compliance with the PWS signature
     service requirements. When signature service material is offered for movement, the
     CRAF carrier must comply with the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements.
     When unforeseen situations do occur, the carrier should advise the DOD in advance to
     prevent unauthorized release of signature service material or shipment delays. It is not
     the Government’s intent that a carrier’s inability to meet the PWS requirement become an
     operational norm, but only a way to coordinate a very rare exception that could not have
     been prevented through sound operational planning.
     9.3.4. Classified cargo (up to top secret) may be transported on contract aircraft without
     regard to nationality of the aircrew, if the cargo is under the custody of properly cleared
     escorts/couriers or defense courier personnel.
     9.3.5. For other items requiring hand-to-hand receipt (signature service), there is no
     requirement to verify the crewmembers are U.S. citizens.
     9.3.6. Ordinary mail may be handled by foreign nationals, when designated and
     authorized in writing by the squadron commander or detachment chief (contract
     equivalent).
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   19


10. Mishap Prevention.
   10.1. General. All personnel must be on constant alert for potential accidents. Functional
   managers and supervisors must ensure all personnel are aware of the dangers in high hazard
   areas. They will establish and manage unit programs as prescribed by AFI 91-202, AMC
   Sup 1, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and AFI 90-901, Operational Risk
   Management. Additionally, appropriate guidelines/checklists, e.g. Load Team Checklist at
   Attachment 6 of this volume, will be used to ensure safe operations and reduce the potential
   for mishaps.

Section C—Cargo/Mail Documentation, Packaging, Marking, and Labeling

11. General. Procedures outlined in this section pertain to the control, preparation, and
documentation of cargo and mail for movement in the AMC airlift system on Transportation
Working Capital Fund (TWCF) aircraft, and aircraft offering opportune airlift, e.g., ANG or
AFRC. Normally, airlift eligible mail is moved on scheduled US commercial air carriers.
Where scheduled US commercial air carriers do not operate or have insufficient frequency,
capacity, or security, mail may be tendered to AMC for movement. The 618 AOC/XOG will
coordinate with postal authorities after determining if airlift capability exists to support mail
movement and control the flow of mail into the airlift system.
   11.1. Preparation. All cargo/mail shipments presented for movement must be properly
   cleared, packed, marked, labeled, and documented prior to acceptance. Hazardous materials
   shipments will not be accepted for movement without proper certification. Air terminals
   receiving shipments suspected of not being certified for air transport or airlift eligible are to
   contact the appropriate ACA/CSB, and if still in doubt, contact HQ AMC/A4TC for
   guidance.
   11.2. Status of Shipment Requests. Direct inquiries concerning shipment status from non-
   AMC transportation personnel to the Air Clearance Authority (ACA), Customer Service
   Branch (CSB), Liaison Officer (LNO) or Traffic Management Office (TMO), IAW DTR,
   Part II and AFI 24-203.
12. DD Form 1384, Transportation Control and Movement Document (TCMD).
   12.1. Purpose. An electronic TCMD sent in advance of cargo movement, becomes an
   advanced TCMD (ATCMD) and provides the ACA and AMC with advance information on
   all shipments entering the AMC airlift system. Shippers submit the required ATCMD
   information via the Cargo Movement Operations System (CMOS) at base traffic
   management office, faxing or phoning the information to the ACA, or using the ACA online
   submission form. The shipping activity prepares the TCMD IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter 203
   and Appendix M, for each cargo/mail shipment prior to entry into the airlift system.
   12.2. The TCMD is used to:
       12.2.1. Document each shipment in the DTS.
       12.2.2. In-check cargo/mail shipments.
       12.2.3. Process shipments and report cargo/mail port levels/movements.
       12.2.4. Record terminal cargo/mail transactions.
 20                                                    AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


13. Military Shipping Labels (MSLs)/DD Form 1387, Military Shipment Label (MSL). The
MSLs are used to identify cargo entering the DTS. The shipper must prepare and attach an MSL
to each piece of a shipment. The MSL must have 2D-bar coding with entries of a transportation
control number (TCN), consignee Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC),
and piece number. These are mandatory for all cargo shipments IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter 208.
If a shipment arrives at the terminal without 2D-bar coded MSLs, coordinate with ACA/CSB for
corrective action.
   13.1. The DD Form 1387, is only used when there is no automated printing capability or
   during emergency operations when hand-written/manual labeling is the only alternative.
14. US Postal Service (USPS) Label 135/136. The postal service label will be used to identify
mail pouches in the DTS IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter 208. The label contains information
necessary to permit prompt and efficient movement from origin, through each transshipment
point and to final destination. A postal service label will be prepared by the postal activity for
each piece of mail entering the airlift system.
15. Packing and Marking.
   15.1. Cargo. Packing and marking will be IAW DTR Part II , AFI 24-203, AFMAN 24-204
   _IP, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments, applicable TOs, and
   MILSTD-129P, Military Marking for Shipment and Storage. All previous shipping data
   (labels, etc.) will be removed or obliterated prior to acceptance of shipments. Reconcile
   irregularities with the ACA or CSB prior to accepting cargo into the airlift system.
   15.2. Mail. Mail accepted for airlift must be enclosed in mail pouches or sacks and securely
   fastened by lock or seal, except those which, because of their size, weight, nature of their
   contents or condition, preclude sacking; e.g., motion picture film, fragile articles, etc.
   Hazardous materials are not sent through the mail system. The US Postal Service
   Publication 52, Hazardous, Restricted, and Perishable Mail, lists restricted materials.
16. Air Cargo Clearance.
   16.1. General. Each Service ACA clears cargo shipments prior to entering the military airlift
   system. The shipping activity or sponsoring authority will furnish the ACA an ATCMD with
   required prime and trailer data information on each cargo shipment to obtain clearance for
   movement. Shippers will submit ATCMDs IAW time frames outlined in DTR, Part II,
   Chapter 203. Mail, AMC mission capability shipments MICAPS/VVIP, forward supply
   system (FSS) shipments, Code J baggage, blood shipments, courier materials, SAAM,
   Contingency, and Exercise cargo do not require an ATCMD. AMC MICAP and FSS
   shipments must reflect the proper project code in the project code field of the TCMD, and a
   valid/billable transportation account code (TAC) to ensure identification of these type
   shipments. All air eligible shipments must contain, in the required delivery date (RDD) field
   of the TCMD, either a unique indicator [(i.e. “555-an exception to blanket holds (DTR Part
   II, Chap 202, Paragraph K.3.a.1.)] or a numerical Julian date.
   16.2. Automated Stations. At automated stations, the ACA receives the TCMD from the
   shipper via telephone, fax, electronic systems, etc., and assures it is accurate and complete.
   The ACA will either clear (accept) the shipment, or challenge the shipment IAW DTR Part
   II/AFI 24-203. When the ACA clears a shipment and the information enters the port’s
   database, the data is retained awaiting the arrival of the shipment at the APOE.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               21


   16.3. Non-Automated Stations. At non-automated stations, the ACA will receive TCMDs
   with appropriate trailer information in manual format. The ACA will ensure the TCMD is
   accurate and complete and either clear (accept) or challenge the shipment IAW DTR Part
   II/AFI 24-203. After clearing the shipment, the ACA enters it into the expected receipt file.
   Upon receipt and in-check of the shipment, a copy of the ATCMD is provided to cargo
   processing for on-hand files and disposition IAW AF Records Disposition Schedule available
   on-line at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rds/rds_series.cfm , Disposition of
   Air Force Records – Records Disposition Schedule.
17. AMC Customer Service Branch (CSB) Operations.
   17.1. General. CSBs at aerial ports are the single point of contact providing liaison among
   shipper services, air clearance authorities ACA, and AMC. Cargo CSBs are located at Travis
   AFB, California; Dover AFB, Delaware; Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey;
   Joint Base Charleston, South Carolina; Norfolk Naval Air Station (NAS), Virginia; and Joint
   Base Lewis-McChord, Washington.
   17.2. Customer Service Branch Responsibilities:
      17.2.1. Assists the shipper services at aerial ports and provides maximum assistance
      commensurate with available resources.
      17.2.2. Performs necessary coordinating actions with air terminal operators, ACAs, and
      shipper services to ensure the orderly flow of cargo through aerial ports.
      17.2.3. Responds to requests for tracing cargo and personal property shipments from any
      source.
          17.2.3.1. Complete AMC Form 1003, Transportation Project Action Request, for
          tracer requests only, when information is not readily available or after information
          has been provided to the requester.
      17.2.4. Ensures timely processing of unscheduled or frustrated cargo and corrects
      discrepancies involving inbound and outbound shipments within the capability of the
      aerial port. Contact the shipper for disposition instructions for frustrated shipments
      beyond the aerial port’s capability to effectively correct.
          17.2.4.1. Air Terminals with recooperage and repacking functions should provide
          assistance in correcting frustrated shipments.
          17.2.4.2. When notified of a frustrated shipment, start resolving the problem as soon
          as possible, but not later than 48 hours after frustration. Once resolved and the
          shipment is ready for onward movement re-enter it into the GATES system.
          17.2.4.3. Properly resolve frustrated hazardous material shipment problems for air
          shipment according to AFMAN 24-204_IP, Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations
          (CFR), International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulation,
          or International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Dangerous Goods Manual. If
          not economically feasible to repack for air shipment, contact Service ACA and advise
          of intention to divert to surface. Prepare a SF 364 and forward to appropriate
          agencies. Use AMC Form 1033/1033-1, Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous
          Goods, or a similar form to certify hazardous material shipments.
22                                                  AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


        17.2.4.4. Clear SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL frustrated shipments or security
        cargo as expeditiously as possible while it remains in the aerial port security cage.
        Prepare SF 364 and forward to appropriate agencies.
        17.2.4.5. If shipments of firearms, explosives (class/division 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3), or
        controlled item code (CIC) 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9 are frustrated over 48 hours, advise
        consignor and consignee via Report of Shipment (REPSHIP).
     17.2.5. Coordinates with the applicable service ACA to clear shipments arriving at the
     aerial port of embarkation APOE without an ATCMD when a valid TAC can be
     determined from the MSL, government bill of lading/commercial bill of lading
     (GBL/CBL), or shipment documentation. Comply with service policy concerning
     movement of non-cleared “No-Hit” cargo. Contact Service ACA or shipper for any
     additional information needed to clear “No-Hit” shipments.
     17.2.6. Performs annual site visits to major shippers to discuss how to properly prepare
     cargo and records for air movement, and to resolve issues involving shipping and
     receiving of cargo.
     17.2.7. Monitors Code J/ Direct Procurement Method (DPM) Baggage. In coordination
     with the air freight officer/superintendent, upgrade Code J/DPM baggage pallets to TP-1
     after they have been held in the port for 5 days due to inadequate airlift. Physical
     upgrade is not required; however, the CSB will upgrade the shipment’s priority within
     GATES.
     17.2.8. Arranges for diversion of cargo according to ACA and shipper instructions.
        17.2.8.1. Place cargo to be diverted (or held) in a frustrated status until disposition
        instructions are received. When forwarding instructions are received, coordinate with
        the Traffic Management Flight (TMF) and aerial port personnel to move shipments to
        final destination.
     17.2.9. Change the precedence of movement of specific shipments (Green Sheet Request,
     or Purple Sheet Request from the Combatant Command) as requested by shipper Service
     ACAs in coordination with the aerial port squadron operations officer. Ensure proper
     application of Green Sheet/Purple Sheet procedures according to AMCI 24-101, Vol. 9.
        17.2.9.1. Provide a properly authenticated AMC Form 101 in original and one copy
        to the aerial port load planning section or designated representative for each TCN for
        which Green Sheet action has been requested.
     17.2.10. Report Shipment Discrepancies.
        17.2.10.1. For over/short and damaged shipments, prepare DD Form 361,
        Transportation Discrepancy Report, IAW DTR, Part II.
        17.2.10.2. Packaging discrepancies.      Improperly prepared, packaged, marked,
        labeled, or certified hazmat shipments received by aerial ports, for movement within
        the DTS, must be properly reported. This reporting helps determine the cause of
        discrepancies, and can effect corrective actions and prevent recurrence. Reporting
        requirements are addressed in AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing Hazardous Materials for
        Military Air Shipment, A28.1.2.7 using SF 364, Report of Discrepancy (ROD).
        While the SF 364 remains in use, shipper related discrepancies are reported as a
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              23


        Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) per AFJMAN 23-215, Reporting of Supply
        Discrepancies.
            17.2.10.2.1. Aerial ports will use the web-based program, WebSDR, as the
            mechanism for reporting frustrated shipments due to improper, shipper-related
            packaging, preparation, marking/labeling and documentation of both HAZMAT
            and general cargo.         Aerial ports can gain access to this website via:
            https://dls.daas.dla.mil/portal. Aerial ports will ensure they have an accurate
            Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DODACC) assigned to properly
            facilitate effectiveness of the SDR process.
            17.2.10.2.2. Aerial ports will discontinue using the Global Air Transportation
            Execution System (GATES) function for completing the SF 364 to report shipper
            discrepancies. Our ultimate goal is to have GATES feed information to
            WebSDR.       When this process becomes available, the GATES SF 364
            functionality will be utilized.
            17.2.10.2.3. In some cases, the WebSDR function allows for immediate
            notification of shipment discrepancies to the shipper and functional areas that can
            effect corrective actions. Using WebSDR will not totally eliminate the need for
            aerial port representatives (e.g., customer service branch) to contact shippers
            directly when corrective action is needed. WebSDR action code “3B” notifies
            functional managers at the shipper's service and agency level of minor
            discrepancies resolved by the port or by actions taken immediately by the shipper
            (e.g., minor documentation errors, missing documentation, missing
            marking/labeling, etc) for trend analysis. There is also a capability within
            WebSDR to provide notification when corrective actions go beyond the normal
            capability of the aerial port (e.g., complete repackaging required) or when the
            shipper does not provide or assist with corrective action, when required.
            WebSDR identifies these as action code “3A.” In such cases, aerial ports can
            expect a reply from the shipper and/or appropriate functional manager within 5
            calendar days as to corrective actions being taken.
            17.2.10.2.4. The WebSDR helpdesk will provide assistance with System Access
            Request (SAR) registration problems or technical system issues, but they have
            limited functional knowledge regarding SDRs. The helpdesk will take calls and
            pass questions on to others for assistance, when needed.
            17.2.10.2.5. The SDR is not to be used in place of the SF 361, Transportation
            Discrepancy Report (TDR), to report commercial carrier or aerial port
            discrepancies involving astray cargo, shortage, damage, etc., IAW DTR 4500.9R,
            Part II, Chapter 210. A SDR will not be submitted for "no hits" or non-shipper
            related frustrations (e.g., diplomatic clearances).
            17.2.10.2.6. The requirement to use WebSDR to report supply discrepancies does
            not currently pertain to OCONUS AMC aerial ports, air mobility squadrons, and
            air terminals.
     17.2.11. Reports all frustrated Foreign Military Sales (FMS) shipments to the appropriate
     ACA and FMS case manager for clearance coordination.
 24                                                  AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


      17.2.12. Works with contracting officers and vendors to ensure shipments arriving at the
      APOE are properly prepared for air movement.
      17.2.13. Establishes wartime, contingency, and emergency surge operation procedures.
      17.2.14. Compiles the following workload data monthly and includes in the Station
      Traffic Handling Report (RCS: AMC-A4T) (M&Q) (7107), as prescribed in AMCI 24-
      101, Vol 6: (1) Total cargo shipments frustrated to the CSB (include general and
      hazardous cargo), (2) Total Green Sheet/Purple Sheet expedite shipments completed, and
      (3) Total tracer actions completed.

18. Traffic Management Flight Cargo Processing.
   18.1. Truck Dock Operations. When in-checking cargo consigned to the APS TMF, utilize
   the checklist from DTR, Part II, Chapter 209, Figure 209-2. All discrepancies will be
   reported to the OS&D clerk. When there is apparent damage, the OS&D clerk will follow
   instructions on the above listed checklist. The clerk will then accomplish the required TDR,
   utilizing Global Freight Management’s (GFM) Discrepancy Identification System (DIS)
   application.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 25


   18.2. Place cargo consigned to base supply, tenant or other base organizations in the base
   holding bay and contact the respective organization.               Annotate on the receiving
   documentation the date, time and name of the person contacted for pickup. Advise the
   receiving organization it’s their responsibility to pick up their shipments in a timely manner.
   Annotate the delivery date in CMOS.
   18.3. Cargo consigned to APS for export. Check in cargo as specified in paragraph 20.2 and
   forward any shipment discrepancies to the OS&D clerk. After in-checking is complete,
   deliver cargo to the Cargo Processing Section. Deliver cargo requiring special handling to
   the Special Handling Section.
   18.4. If there are any documentation discrepancies, such as missing labels, or improper
   paperwork or HAZMAT documentation, etc., forward the shipment with movement
   documentation to the CSB for resolution. Annotate the delivery date in CMOS.
   18.5. Place import cargo in the receiving bay. The Documentation Section will receive the
   shipment data (through ATCMD, inbound manifest, etc.) and determine the onward shipment
   modes based upon the priority, classification, destination, weight and dimensions of the
   cargo. Forward landbridge cargo to the appropriate APOE using the TWCF fund cite.
   Opportune airlift may be used if available within 24 hours (see paragraph 32.2.8.1). For
   shipments required to be forwarded to CONUS consignees via domestic surface movement,
   use the applicable TAC. If the TAC used for airlift cannot be used for onward movement,
   research the TRACKER system for the appropriate TAC. If no TAC code can be found,
   contact the consignor for the correct fund cite.
   18.6. Traffic management offices will request tarping service when ordering trucks for
   Personal Property (PPTY) transport. In addition, a change to the international solicitation
   has been coordinated with Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC)
   to clarify the requirement for transportation service providers (TSP’s) to place two
   serviceable plastic covers over PPTY shipments secured under the net-set. In addition,
   TSP’s are required to elevate fiberboard (cardboard) boxes from the surface of the 463L
   pallet, to reduce the possibility of water seeping into the shipment.
   18.7. When processing Transportation Protection Services (TPS) cargo, refer to para 40.9,
   Traffic Management Process for TPS Shipments and Attachment 7, AMC Form 478, AMC
   Intransit TPS Worksheet.
19. Receiving Cargo and Mail.
   19.1. General. Air terminals receive cargo/mail from a wide variety of sources with
   differing documentation, e.g., CBL/GBL, TCMDs and truck/aircraft manifests. In addition
   to this, the degree of automation will affect specific receipt procedures. Use applicable
   publications at automated stations for specific guidance in producing mechanized or
   computer products for receiving cargo/mail. (See Section H of this volume for guidance on
   processing shipments with irregularities.)
   19.2. Procedures. Air terminals will ensure all inbound CBLs/GBLs, waybills, TCMDs, and
   manifests are annotated with the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) hour code and the last two
   digits of the Julian date of receipt.
26                                                     AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


     19.2.1. Originating cargo/mail will arrive with an original and duplicate TCMD or listing
     with trailer information attached. Annotate the GMT hour code and last two digits of the
     Julian date of arrival in the appropriate field on both TCMDs. The time and date entered
     in this field starts AMC possession time and also establishes SET. The duplicate copy of
     the TCMD or listing will be signed and returned to the carrier as a receipt. Use the
     original TCMD to process the shipments into the military airlift system.
     19.2.2. Receipt for registered mail using the TCMD or manifest as a hand-to-hand receipt.
     Personnel receiving registered mail must check the TCNs and register numbers against the
     TCMD or manifest, sign one copy of the document and return it to the individual releasing
     the registered mail. Personnel receipting for registered mail will sign their full name, grade,
     organization and legibly print their full name below the signature. Truck manifests used as a
     receipt for terminating registered mail will have the same retention period as air inbound
     registered mail manifests IAW AF Records Disposition Schedule available on-line at
     https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rds/rds_series.cfm.
     19.2.3. When receipting for Personal Property Code J/DPM Baggage or Code
     T/Household Goods, refer to Section G, Para 52.
     19.2.4. At automated locations, the cargo TCN is input into the system to match with the
     ATCMD submitted earlier from the ACAs. If the ATCMD is on file, the complete
     TCMD is readily available for further processing of the shipment.
     19.2.5. When no ATCMD is available (No-Hit), contact the ACA/CSB for clearance and
     system input. A No-Hit listing is provided by the system for all shipments without
     ATCMDs and will be used by the ACA/CSB to identify and take corrective actions with
     shippers responsible for No-Hits.
     19.2.6. All cargo accepted at an AMC aerial port must have a valid TAC assigned at
     origin and applied to the shipment until the cargo reaches its final destination.
        19.2.6.1. Intra-theater cargo. Cargo originating and terminating within the Central
        Command (CENTCOM), or origin theater, Area of Responsibility (AOR) accepted
        for movement on AMC channels, will have a valid TAC. Although AMC will not
        bill the individual TAC for airlift on contingency missions, the TAC must be valid for
        accounting purposes and to ensure continued movement of the cargo outside the
        CENTCOM theater, if/when necessary.
        19.2.6.2. All intra-theater contingency operations cargo being airlifted within
        CENTCOM will be moved utilizing the assigned TAC. The use of any “_SAM”
        TAC’s will only be accepted for actual Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM).
        19.2.6.3. AMC/FMFN will review and verify the APOE and APOD for all
        CENTCOM intra-theater airlift movements. If the APOE and APOD are both located
        within the CENTCOM AOR, the owner of the TAC will not be billed. If the APOE
        and APOD are located in different/separate specified theaters (e.g., CENTCOM to
        EUCOM or, more specifically, Al Udeid to Ramstein), Financial Services
        (AMC/FMFN) will bill the manifest detail(s).
        19.2.6.4. For non-contingency operations, intra-theater transportation payments will
        remain the responsibility of the ordering military department.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                     27


20. Processing Cargo/Mail and Document Flow.
   20.1. General. Precedence of cargo/mail to be processed is determined by the destination,
   transportation priority, and SET. SET is established when a shipment enters the AMC airlift
   system (receipt time). The shipment is controlled by SET throughout the AMC system. Use
   cargo movement priority and movement indicators (e.g., 999, N__, E__, 777, 555, 444 or
   RDD) to determine which shipments to process first when the SET is equal.
   20.2. In-checking Cargo/Mail. Manually check cargo/mail against the accompanying
   documents to ensure each shipment unit is complete and properly documented. Perform a
   visual inspection of all cargo/mail to ensure it is packed, marked, and labeled IAW applicable
   directives. Ensure outside dimensions, axle weight, center of balance (CB) markings and
   weight of all items are correct. CB computation instructions are provided in paragraph 24 of
   this volume, and TO 1C-XXX-9. Refer discrepant shipments and reconcile all irregularities
   to ACA/CSB prior to acceptance into the AMC airlift system. See Section H of this volume
   for specific guidance.
   20.3. Processing. Segregate cargo/mail (originating or in-transit) in the appropriate terminal
   bay or pallet location for movement. Process all cargo/mail for shipment via AMC contract
   carrier or military air transportation as soon as possible not to exceed 6 hours of receipt time.
   AMC MICAP/VVIP will be processed immediately for onward movement. When releasing
   to consignee activities, AMC MICAP/VVIP will be available to release within 30 minutes.
   When cargo/mail is processed manually, the following procedures will apply:
      20.3.1. Screen all cargo during processing to detect hazardous materials not identified by
      the shipper. Personnel performing receipt/in-check of hazardous cargo must be, at a
      minimum, “HAZMAT Handler” CBT-qualified.
      20.3.2. Annotate the appropriate two-digit air cargo/mail bay warehouse location for
      loose shipments, or assign a pallet identifier for items being palletized in the appropriate
      field on the TCMDs. Transcribe the GMT hour code and last two digits of the Julian date
      from the receipt document (manifest, CBL/GBL, etc.) onto each TCMD (manual or
      electronic) in the appropriate field. Enter eligible shipments into the movement-ready,
      on-hand file.
   20.4. Preventing Water Damage. Personnel will comply with this instruction during cargo
   incheck at originating, en route and terminating stations. Perform a complete visual
   inspection of loose and palletized cargo and personal property. Inspect the exterior
   packaging/container for signs of damage to include water damage. The visual inspection will
   include serviceability of the container, pallet, net-set and plastic covers. For pre-built pallets,
   removal of the nets and plastic should not be necessary unless water damage is suspected.
   Property shipments must be properly protected from the elements while awaiting onward
   transportation.
      20.4.1. If wet or damaged cargo is found within the AMC airlift system, follow
      established policy in this instruction, para 73. A TDR will be prepared utilizing GFM’s
      DIS application, as required. IMPORTANT: Do not refuse shipments received from
      intermediate carriers.
      20.4.2. Automated Stations. GATES will use all accepted inputs to validate and build
      cargo records in the database and to change the status of cargo to "In-checked,"
 28                                                   AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


       "Processed," or "Frustrated" via hand-held terminals (HHT), bar code readers, or
       keyboard entry. Consult GATES Users Manual.
   20.5. Split Shipments. Do not split shipments after receiving them into the airlift system
   unless it is necessary to split for palletizing purposes, or because a single shipment exceeds
   airlift capability of a single aircraft. Maintain shipment integrity when load planning
   shipments that are split because entire shipment would not fit on a single pallet. Move spilt
   shipments that exceed single aircraft capability on the minimum number of aircraft possible.
       20.5.1. Personal Property Shipments. Make every effort to maintain integrity for
       personal property shipments however these shipments may be split shipped to achieve
       optimum aircraft utilization. When split shipments of personal property occur, the
       remaining increments should move on the next available aircraft. Ship all increments of
       split-shipped personal property to the same APOD.
       20.5.2. When it is necessary to split shipments, compute the number of pieces, weight,
       and cube of each portion of the shipment (actual weight and cube of each item) and
       prepare a TCMD or update the record for each portion with the appropriate split shipment
       indicator IAW DTR, Part II, Appendix L. Place each TCMD in the cargo on-hand file or
       retain in the database.
       20.5.3. Make changes on the MSL to reflect the corresponding split indicated on the
       TCMD and verify the weight of each piece. Automated stations will reprint a new MSL
       to attach to each piece.
       20.5.4. If the shipment is hazardous, follow procedures outlined in AFMAN 24-204_IP,
       Attachment 17, A17.2.5.

Section D—Pallet Build-Up

21. General. The 463L air cargo pallet, type HCU-6E, is used within the AMC airlift system.
For detailed instructions concerning handling, inspection, maintenance, care, and storage of
463L pallets and associated net sets, see TOs 36M-1-141, 35D33-2-2-2 and 35D33-2-3-1.
Management of 463L pallets and nets is contained in DTR Part VI, Management & Control of
Intermodal Containers & System 463L Equipment.
22. Pallet Build-Up Procedures.
   22.1. General. Prior to use, pallets must be thoroughly cleaned and inspected (top & bottom)
   for missing and cracked D rings, warping, exposed core and/or extreme delamination. Some
   damaged pallets can be repaired at base-level, thus reducing depot repair and transportation
   costs. Follow the pallet (TO 35D33-2-2-2) instructions to determine what damaged pallets
   can be repaired locally and how to repair them.
       22.1.1. Before stacking cargo or mail on pallets, ensure the pallet is fully supported on
       rollers, pallet dolly or appropriate 3-point dunnage. (See TO 35D33-2-2-2 for dunnage
       requirements) Note: If the dunnage is destined for export, it must be Wood Packaging
       Material (WPM) approved.
   22.2. Cargo Selection. Palletize cargo or mail by destination, movement indicator, and SET
   within movement priority. The pallet SET is the earliest SET of the highest priority of
   shipment on the pallet. To the greatest extent possible, build each cargo or mail pallet for
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 29


  one destination. However, to fully utilize a pallet (especially for low volume channels),
  terminals may combine cargo or mail for multiple destinations to ensure timely movement,
  keeping in mind that the AMC goal is to avoid needless pallet breakdown and cargo
  rehandling at transshipment points.
     22.2.1. Under Precision Loading (PL), the AMC measure of merit is to build pallets to
     maximum pallet utilization by weight and/or cube. Cargo processors should strive to
     obtain at least 90% of a pallet’s max weight and/or 80% of its cube, by module, IAW
     specific goals listed on the AMC/A4TC Web page. Pallet weight/cube goals apply to
     general cargo within the channel airlift system; however, cleared and compatible
     hazardous material shipments can be capped with general cargo to assist in meeting
     weight/cube goals. Cargo processors may aggregate cargo and operate under relaxed
     First-In, First-Out (FIFO) authority. This increases cargo availability for building bigger
     and heavier pallets. FIFO is the policy, but if increased pallet utilization can be achieved,
     cargo processors have the authority to aggregate cargo and deviate from FIFO
     requirements where it makes sense. For example, the bay area does not contain enough
     cargo to build a fully utilized module “L” pallet. Cargo processors are authorized to
     NOT build this cargo and hold while more cargo aggregates. Once bay contains enough
     cargo to build a fully utilized pallet, cargo processors can then begin pallet build process.
     In other words, cargo processors should not build pallets just to clear the floor, but to
     meet specific build-to-requirements when sufficient cargo exists to maximize pallet
     utilization. The same holds true for cargo selection from within the bay. Cargo
     processors can deviate from FIFO selection in order to build larger squared or contoured
     pallets by selecting newer cargo over old.
     22.2.2. The expeditious movement and delivery of TP-1 shipments with movement
     indicators is dependent upon available airlift and priority processing. In order to
     maximize aircraft utilization and reduce processing times, single priority pallets should
     be built to the maximum extent possible. Maximize efforts to move loose MICAP and
     TP-1 shipments with movement indicators to the point that will avoid a delay on mission
     departure. Note: Separate cargo or mail on multiple destination pallets to be offloaded at
     en route stops by destination, using plastic covers or a suitable substitute inserted
     between each destination to permit rapid identification.
     22.2.3. To best support the war-fighter, Combatant Commands (COCOM) may require
     pallets delivered to their AOR to be “pure.” These pure pallets are shipped palletized
     beyond the APOD all the way to the end user. The pure pallet program increases the
     effectiveness and velocity of shipments to the final end users by relieving the AOR of the
     burden of breaking bulk pallets. A “Pure Pallet” is defined as a pallet which contains
     only shipments destined to a single DOD Activity Address Code (DODAAC) or a Supply
     Support Activity (SSA) as specifically outlined in a published COCOM Route Plan. It
     has been demonstrated that pure pallet route plan is effective in theaters with high
     volumes of cargo and an undeveloped logistics infrastructure.
  22.3. Build-Up. Pallet should be built only IAW Load Planning direction or when:
  Precision Loading goals can be met, cargo bays have reached maximum capacity, or cargo
  bay location(s) contain non-stackable cargo commodities. When directed by Load Planning
  to build specific pallet modules, cargo processors will strive to meet weight/cube goals for
  each module. When insufficient cargo exists to build a fully utilized module type pallet
30                                                    AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


  requested by Load Planning, cargo processing must contact Load Planning outlining the
  issue. Aerial ports must not build pallets just to clear the floor. Building must only occur
  when a specific module type requirement exists or cargo bays are full. For low volume ports,
  build to the maximum extent possible.
     22.3.1. Load dense cargo and crated/boxed cargo on the pallet first. Ensure cargo is
     stacked with no gaps and distributed evenly. Stack crushable and light density cargo on
     top of the load, or use as filler cargo around the high-density or crated/boxed cargo.
     Monitor stacking to ensure cargo overhang is limited. Stack mail and other items without
     definite shape to minimize shifting on the pallet. Evenly distribute heavy items from the
     center of the pallet outward. Build pallets for maximum pallet utilization. Pallet
     utilization may be limited by aircraft and weight limitations and cargo loading
     characteristics.
     22.3.2. When barrels, drums or other unstable items are stacked more than one high,
     place plywood or other suitable material between each stack. Use material thick enough
     to prevent the cargo from shifting. Metal-to-metal contact is permissible.
     22.3.3. Aircraft pallet load weights are limited by the aircraft roller limitations found in
     the applicable Aircraft Loading Manual Instruction TO1C-XXX-9 and the pallet
     structural limitation of 250 lbs per square inch (PSI), whichever occurs first. Shore cargo
     with plywood to increase the contact area when the PSI limit is exceeded and add
     additional shoring to comply with roller limitations.
         22.3.3.1. Use plywood or cardboard to protect the pallet surface when loading cargo
         with sharp edges.
     22.3.4. When the pallet is assembled in the desired configuration, cover the contents with
     a plastic pallet cover (NSN 3990-00-930-1480). Except for the following, plastic covers
     should fully cover the pallet to protect the contents from the elements.
         22.3.4.1. Subsistence Items. Do not place plastic covers over subsistence items (e.g.,
         dairy products, vegetables, fruits, etc.) received and shipped in multi-wall, wax-
         impregnated, corrugated fiberboard boxes. However, when such items are shipped in
         other containers (pasteboard boxes, etc.), place plastic covers over the nets, rolled up
         on all sides to top of cargo and hold in place with straps. (EXCEPTION: In
         extremely cold climates, plastic covers must be placed over the entire pallet to protect
         these items from inclement weather.)
             22.3.4.1.1. During hot weather, these items require ventilation to prevent
             spoilage. If the plastic is allowed to cover the entire pallet, trapped gases (normal
             respiration) of fruits and vegetables can cause rapid ripening/spoilage of the
             produce. Provide these pallets inside storage in a cool, well ventilated area to the
             maximum extent possible.
         22.3.4.2. Personal property. Protect all household goods and unaccompanied
         baggage shipments from the elements by placing two plastic covers under the nets.
         When possible, personal property will be stored indoors and protected from inclement
         weather. When stored outdoors or transported during inclement weather, an
         additional dry and serviceable pallet cover (third) will be secured over the net-set.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  31


             22.3.4.2.1. Personal property shipments will always be stored inside prior to
             processing and palletizing. It is permissible to use serviceable “used” pallet
             covers on personal property shipments. When receiving palletized personal
             property shipments from commercial carriers for entry into the airlift system,
             inspect the pallet covers for tears or rips. If any are found, re-cover the pallet(s).
         22.3.4.3. C-130J Propellers.
             22.3.4.3.1. From the ground only, perform all operations necessary to handle and
             store C-130J propellers, to include palletization, surface transport and
             on/offloading of K-Loaders. Do not place within, move, or otherwise sequence
             propellers using mechanized material handling equipment or highline docks.
             Categorize palletized C-130J propellers as oversize/outsize loose cargo IAW this
             instruction. C-130J propellers will be placed on 463L pallets with its front facing
             towards the longitudinal (88 inch) side of the pallet.
             22.3.4.3.2. Move palletized C-130J propellers via 10K forklift from the
             longitudinal (88 inch) side with the propeller blades facing forward. Apply
             careful attention to prevent contact with the forklift carriage. Use of a spotter
             during forklift positioning is mandatory. Load/unload propellers onto K-Loaders
             from the rear only. Pay strict attention to clearances in the vicinity of the K-
             Loader cab area. Ensure blades are in a flat (flight idle) position prior to
             movement. Do not change the angle of the blades.
             22.3.4.3.3. If there are questions regarding the angle of the blades, contact the C-
             130J propulsion System(s) Program Office (SPO) at Robins AFB, DSN 468-7342
             or 468-7364.
  22.4. Restraint:
     22.4.1. Secure contents to the pallet during pallet build-up IAW TO 35D33-2-2-2 and the
     applicable Aircraft Loading Manual TO 1C-XXX-9.
     22.4.2. Inspect tie-down equipment used to restrain cargo to the pallets for damage. Do
     not use damaged tie-down equipment. Compute tie-down requirements and attach tie-
     down equipment in pairs; i.e., if devices/chains are used on one side of the pallet, use an
     equal number of devices/chains on the opposite side. Inspect nets for damage (e.g., cuts,
     fraying, missing components, etc.). Do not use damaged nets.
     22.4.3. Do not mix chains and straps to provide restraint in the same direction. Although
     materials stretch in proportion to the applied load, different materials have different rates
     of elongation. Nylon devices stretch more readily than steel under tension. Therefore,
     when two or more tie-down devices are required to restrain a unit of cargo, the devices
     must be of the same type and the ties must be approximately the same length.
     22.4.4. When pallets are restrained with aircraft tie-down equipment (chains and
     devices), the limiting factor is the aircraft pallet rail system and the floor tie-down point
     limitation found in the applicable Aircraft Loading Manual T.O. 1C-XXX-9. Do not
     over-tighten tie-down devices. Over-tightening will bow the pallet and cause it to warp.
     Tie-down devices should be snug and final tightening accomplished after the pallet is
     loaded aboard the aircraft.
32                                                   AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


     22.4.5. When a single 463L pallet is restrained with nets (two side nets and one top net),
     the pallet net weight limit is 10,000 lbs. Do not attach top and side net hooks to the
     webbing material of the nets. Attach the hooks to the highest level of side rings on or
     near the top of the cargo, leaving enough space to tighten the top net. Tighten all nets
     and stow all loose ends to prevent interference with aircraft loading operations.
     22.4.6. When low profile, bulk/high density cargo is loaded on pallets, side nets may be
     used for restraint without the top net, provided the side nets are pulled tight and secured
     with tie-down straps. Use a minimum of seven straps, four longitudinal on the 108” side
     and three lateral straps on the 88” side. Connect the straps to the highest level of side
     rings on or near the top of the cargo.
     22.4.7. When low profile cargo/mail does not permit the use of side nets, the top net will
     provide restraint in all directions provided the pallet does not exceed a height of 45
     inches or net weight of 2,500 lbs. If either the 45inches in height or 2,500 lb weight is
     exceeded, use the appropriate Aircraft Loading Manual, TO 1C-XXX-9 restraint
     limitations to determine the amount of straps (CGU-1/B) or chains (MB-1/MB-2) to
     provide proper forward, lateral, and aft restraint.
  22.5. Palletizing and Securing Empty 463L Pallets for Airlift.
     22.5.1. Pallets may be stacked to a maximum of 20 pallets, excluding the base support
     pallet. Separate the first pallet from the base support pallet with three longitudinal or
     lateral rows of lumber/dunnage (4 inches by 4 inches by 88 inches, commercial grade)
     placed an equal distance apart laterally or by placing four wooden warehouse skids of
     equal thickness to cover the entire surface of the base pallet. Secure pallet stacks with
     side and top nets or side nets and straps. Side nets must be cinched as tightly as possible
     to prevent snagging on the K-Loader/aircraft restraint rails. For stacks of six or more
     empty pallets, you must use nets for restraint; five or fewer pallets may be restrained with
     cargo straps or chains. When using sides and straps for less than 20 pallets, ensure
     ratchets are placed on the top of the pallet.
  22.6. Deployment/Redeployment of Damaged Internal Slingable Units (ISU) Containers.
     22.6.1. Channel Airlift: Damaged ISU containers will not be accepted for channel
     movement except when empty and being returned for repairs. Damaged ISU containers
     will be placed on a base support pallet separated by three longitudinal rows of dunnage or
     four warehouse skids (if dunnage is not available). The ISU container must be secured to
     meet aircraft tie-down restraint criteria and aircraft roller limitations. Note: When
     transporting damaged ISU containers separated by dunnage/warehouse skids, ramp
     personnel must pay close attention to clearances when approaching aircraft.
     22.6.2. Deployments: Pallets/Containers that are warped, have unserviceable or loose
     attachments, exposed deteriorating balsa core, external delamination, or any punctures to
     the underside of the base support pallet that contacts the rollers, will not be accepted for
     movement during deployments from home stations.
     22.6.3. Redeployments: Damaged ISU containers may be placed on a base support
     pallet IAW above paragraph 22.6.1. Note: It is not necessary to empty the containers of
     their contents.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  33


23. Pallet Trains.
   23.1. General. When it is necessary to use more than one pallet to transport items exceeding
   the usable dimensions of a single pallet, marry pallets to form a train with aluminum pallet
   spacers IAW TO 36M-1-141. Use only KC-10 pallet couplers on KC-10 Aircraft. Prior to
   marrying pallets, give consideration to the type of equipment at the destination station
   required to handle the train.
       23.1.1. Assemble trains on rollerized surfaces (e.g., Hi-line docks, rollerized flatbeds,
       etc.) capable of supporting the gross weight of the train load. The rollerized surfaces
       must also be accessible to the conveyance used to transport the train to the aircraft.
   23.2. Build-Up. When possible, place long items on pallets in a manner to evenly distribute
   the weight on all pallets. Use dunnage to help distribute the weight evenly. Add dunnage
   weight to the tare weight.
       23.2.1. Determine if maximum pallet weight exceed the roller weight by referencing
       aircraft roller limitations found in the applicable aircraft TO 1C-XXX-9. Also, consider
       the type of MHE required to handle the pallets at originating, en route, and terminating
       stations (e.g., 25K loader, 60K loader).
       23.2.2. Specific pallet height, contour, and safety aisle limitations depend on the type of
       aircraft, and can be found in the applicable aircraft TO 1C XXX-9.
       23.2.3. When possible, place protective plastic covers over contents on the train.
       23.2.4. Distribute the weight of items stacked on the pallet train to prevent the train from
       being side or top heavy. If it is impossible to distribute cargo weight evenly, then mark
       train with additional placards/labels (e.g., C/B, side or top heavy, etc.).
       23.2.5. When unstable items are stacked more than 45 inches high, use plywood or other
       suitable material to prevent cargo from shifting. Use plywood or cardboard to protect
       pallet surfaces when loading cargo with sharp edges. Note: Do not mix KC-10 and
       Standard Pallet couplers on the same pallet train.
   23.3. Restraint. There are many techniques of tying down large pieces of cargo. Use the
   following key points and consult applicable Aircraft Loading Manual TO 1C-XXX-9, as
   necessary.
       23.3.1. Use a restraint barrier for forward and aft restraint (3/4-inch plywood) for loose
       heavy items such as lumber, pipe, long metal/wood/cardboard boxes, etc. Additional
       layers may be needed to adequately restrain these items. Include these items in tare
       weight.
          23.3.1.1. Use chains and devices for large items, such as canned engines or wheeled
          equipment.
          23.3.1.2. Use a chain bridle with restraint barriers for heavy items exceeding the
          weight limitation specified in the Aircraft Loading Manual TO 1C-XXX-9, such as
          large boxes or reels.
          23.3.1.3. Top and side nets are permissible for use on two and three pallet trains
          within weight limitations listed in the aircraft technical order. This method allows
          filler cargo to be moved on pallet trains for enhanced utilization.

          23.3.1.4. Reference paragraph 94.3 for cargo loaded within 30 inches of passengers.
24. Center of Balance (C/B) Computation.
   24.1. General. Marking the center of balance C/B is not necessary on single 463L pallets. If
   pallets are built correctly the C/B will be at, or near the center. Clearly mark the C/B on both
   sides for all items of cargo that meet the following criteria:
      24.1.1. All pallet trains.
      24.1.2. All vehicles/rolling stock.
      24.1.3. Any item with a C/B at a point other than its center.
      24.1.4. Any item 10 ft or longer.
   24.2. Pallet Trains. The C/B for trains will be computed and clearly marked on both sides of
   the train. Hi-line docks and 40-foot rollerized semi-trailers can be stenciled in inches as an
   aid in computing pallet train C/Bs.
      24.2.1. Calculate the total inch-lbs (moment) of the load by multiplying the pallet station
      where the center of balance of each piece of cargo is positioned by the weight of the
      cargo. Total these figures to obtain the total load in-lbs. Divide the total load moment by
      the total load weight to obtain the center of balance location in inches from the leading
      edge of the forward pallet. The C/B location of the total load is equal to the total moment
      of the load, divided by the total weight of the load. Compute accurate pallet train C/Bs
      using the example in Attachment 13. Determine the center of balance of a total load
      consisting of three pallets in a train configuration. Note: In Attachment 13, all C/Bs are
      indicated in inches aft of the leading edge of the forward pallet.
   24.3. Vehicles. The C/B for vehicles will be computed and clearly marked on both sides of
   vehicles. Vehicle C/B formulas can be found in the applicable T.O. 1C-XXX-9 or DTR, Part
   III, Mobility, Appendix P.
      24.3.1. Indicate the item’s gross weight to the nearest lb and the C/B to the nearest inch.
      Mark these values on both sides of the item. The vertical stroke of the “T” will show
      C/B, inches, FFE. The horizontal stroke of the “T” will show the gross weight. See
      Attachment 14.
25. Pallet Weighing, Measuring and Storing.
   25.1. Weighing. Weigh each originating loaded pallet to determine the total weight of the
   pallet, i.e., contents, nets and pallet. Annotate this weight on the DD Form 2775 and enter it
   into GATES or other appropriate automated Intransit Visibility (ITV) system as the gross
   weight. If the terminal is not equipped to weigh pallets, total the weights of the contents of
   the pallet (net or documented weight) and the weight of the pallet and nets. Note: Straps,
   chains, and devices are included as normal aircraft equipment, and therefore are treated as
   zero weight.
      25.1.1. The standard weights for 463L pallets and nets are.
          25.1.1.1. One pallet = 290 lbs.
          25.1.1.2. One set of side nets = 44 lbs.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 35


          25.1.1.3. One top net = 21 lbs.
       25.1.2. Shoring/Dunnage and fore and aft restraint barriers will be weighed and included
       in the tare weight.
       25.1.3. Total the weights of each TCMD for each shipment on the pallet to get the
       documented weight.
       25.1.4. Subtract the tare weight from the gross weight to determine the net weight.
       Compare the net weight with the documented weight, these two figures should be the
       same. Originating stations will investigate differences of plus or minus 150 lbs by
       breaking down the pallet and weighing each piece of cargo on the pallet. This procedure
       will also help to identify over/short shipments.
       25.1.5. Originating terminals incapable of weighing 463L pallets will individually weigh
       all items.
   25.2. Measuring. All heights are measured from the upper surface of the pallets. The
   maximum weight/stacking height of netted cargo or mail on a single pallet at 10,000 lbs is 96
   inches (at 8,000 lbs, 100 inches). The maximum height limitation depends on the type of
   aircraft and can be found in the applicable Aircraft Loading Manual TO 1C-XXX-9.
   25.3. Storage. Completed pallets will be placed in appropriate grid locations as outlined in
   this volume, paragraph 31.
       25.3.1. Use inside storage facilities approved by the host base safety office for
       explosives. Under certain conditions, outdoor storage may be authorized IAW AFMAN
       91-201. When outdoor storage is approved, provide protection from the elements IAW
       AFMAN 91-201. Provide pallets of other hazardous materials requiring cool/ventilated
       storage protection equal to that required for explosives. Coordinate with installation
       resource protection to ensure minimum security requirements are complied with for
       outdoor storage.
   25.4. Cargo processors must accurately CAP pallets in GATES to the most restrictive
   module type which matches the pallet’s contour. All stations will post visual aids near pallet
   build areas with current pallet module types and utilization goals. Visual aids and pallet
   utilization goals are posted on the AMC/A4TC Web page.
26. Assignment of Pallet Identifiers.
   26.1. GATES will assign each originating pallet, pallet train, and each piece of rolling stock
   a pallet identifier. Pallet IDs in GATES are six characters: 1st three characters are the APC
   that built the pallet. The 4th and 5th characters are alpha/numerical (I, O, and 0 are not
   used); the last character (6th position) is always an alpha character (I and O are never used).
   Note: Alphas "I" and "O" and numeric "0" will not be used. Manual terminals will maintain
   a tracking system to ensure pallet identifiers are not duplicated.
27. DD Form 2775, Pallet Identifier.
   27.1. General. Prepare two copies of DD Form 2775 to identify all completed 463L
   pallets/trains loaded with cargo/mail. Air freight personnel will complete all entries and
   attach the copies to the upper left hand corner at eye level (when pallet height permits), one
   on the 88-inch side and one on the 108-inch side. Place the form inside interlocking closure
 36                                                    AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


   plastic bags (NSN 8105-00-837-7757, or suitable substitute). Entries on the form are self-
   explanatory and will comply with the following:
       27.1.1. Enter POE and POD codes in letters as large as possible to make the entries
       visible from a distance when pulling pallets for a load.
       27.1.2. Annotate the highest priority cargo on the pallet (e.g., “9” [999], “G” [General],
       “S” [Special Handling] or “GS” [Green Sheet] “PS” [Purple Sheet]) in the miscellaneous
       information block. Also include pallet height in this block. Note: This form must never
       reflect the words “classified,” “small arms/weapons,” “munitions,” or other highly
       sensitive items by name.
       27.1.3. Annotate the number of straps, chains, devices, and net sets used on a particular
       pallet or pallet train in the appropriate blocks.
       27.1.4. Complete the scale weight certification block by legibly printing the name and
       grade of the individual weighing the pallet.
28. Pallet Invoice/Listing.
   28.1. General. Prepare pallet invoices for each pallet of cargo/mail. Pallet invoices will
   consist of pallet listings at automated stations and the AMC Form 39, Pallet Invoice, at non-
   automated stations.
       28.1.1. Prepare pallet invoices in duplicate. Place the duplicate copy in the plastic
       envelope with the DD Form 2775.
       28.1.2. The original copy of the pallet invoice is used by the load planner for selecting
       and planning mission loads.
       28.1.3. Pallet invoices will be filed in Load Planning and kept for 30 days after the pallet
       has departed, and then disposed of IAW AF Records Disposition Schedule available on-
       line at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rds/rds_series.cfm.
29. Active Radio Frequency Identification (aRFID) Tags.
   29.1. General. An aRFID tag will be generated for originating retrograde and originating
   sustainment cargo. The aerial port will not place aRFID tags on palletized household goods,
   unaccompanied baggage, Defense Courier materiel, rations, 463L assets, Denton
   Amendment cargo, classified mail, and jingles shipments. This includes intransit or unit
   move cargo that does not already have an aRFID tag attached. (unit movement cargo will be
   tagged by the owning unit)
       29.1.1. aRFID-tagged pallets that are uncapped, and have cargo added or removed, must
       have the aRFID tag written by the port making the change to reflect the updated pallet
       contents created by the change.
   29.2. Procedures.
       29.2.1. Prior to entering the Pallet Processing function in GATES, ensure the aRFID tag
       is operational by removing the battery and reinserting it. The aRFID tag should go
       through a series of beeps. If no beeps are heard, the battery must be replaced with a new
       battery.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  37


      29.2.2. Once the aRFID tag is written in GATES, attach the tag to the pallet netting
      using two nylon tie wraps (self-locking strips, NSN:5975-00-899-4606), preferably in a
      vertical orientation. Attach the tag near the top left corner of the pallet, on a side
      containing a pallet placard.
      29.2.3. Attach the aRFID tag near the placard on an exterior location of equipment where
      the tag is in a location that reasonably assures it can be interrogated as the cargo flows
      through the cargo movement process. The tag must be on the outside of the piece of
      equipment.
30. Aircraft Pallet Limitations and Considerations.
   30.1. C-5 Aircraft:
      30.1.1. The weight limit on the forward or aft ramp is limited to 7,500 lbs per pallet
      position or a maximum ramp load of 15,000 lbs. The maximum height for pallet
      positions 35 and 36 (aft ramp) will not exceed 70 inches (measured on the aft side of the
      pallet).
      30.1.2. The 463L pallets loaded in pallet positions 1, 2, 35, and 36 (forward and aft
      ramps) will have a 14-inch safety aisle that will extend from the outboard edge of the
      pallet to the vertical stacking line of the cargo. This allows aircrew members ample
      clearance for installing/removing ramp manual locking pins and for visually checking the
      mechanical lock indicators.
      30.1.3. The maximum height of cargo/mail on single netted pallets for positions 1
      through 34 is 100 inches.
      30.1.4. The height limitations for oversized single items of palletized cargo (e.g., aircraft
      fuselage assemblies, containers, and special equipment, etc.) is 108 inches above the
      upper surface of the pallet for cargo to be loaded through the aft end of the aircraft and
      156 inches for cargo to be loaded through the forward end of the aircraft.
      30.1.5. When 20 or more passengers/troops are planned for the C-5, leave a pallet
      position open to accommodate palletized baggage.
      30.1.6. Ensure the maximum width of 104-inches of usable area of the pallet is not
      exceeded and no lateral projections or lateral overhangs exist.
      30.1.7. When loading stacks of empty pallets into the logistics restraint rail system of the
      aircraft refer to TOs 1C-5A-9-2 and 1C-5M-9-2 for loading instructions.
      30.1.8. Do not place cargo in a position that restricts the use of the flight deck or troop
      ladders.
      30.1.9. All classes of hazardous materials listed as acceptable for air shipment may be
      transported by C-5 aircraft. Load palletized and loose shipments of hazardous materials
      in the aft-most positions of the aircraft (including ramp), when load configuration and
      aircraft limitations permit.
      30.1.10. For more specific guidance on C-5 aircraft limitations consult TOs 1C-5A-9-3,
      1C-5M-9 and other related loading manuals, as applicable.
38                                                   AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


  30.2. C-17 Aircraft:
     30.2.1. The C-17 has the capability to carry eighteen 463L pallets in the logistics
     restraint rail system or eleven 463L pallets in the aerial delivery rail system (ADS).
     30.2.2. The logistics system can carry fourteen 463L pallets on the main cargo floor and
     4 on the ramp. The 88" sides of these pallets are loaded laterally in the aircraft. The
     ADS can accommodate nine 463L pallets on the main cargo floor and two 463L pallets
     on the ramp.
     30.2.3. Netted cargo, to include household goods containers, will not overhang the
     usable portion (104x84) of the 463L pallet. This allows the locks to clear the cargo and
     engage.
     30.2.4. Due to oxygen lines above pallet position 1 of the ADS, use extreme caution
     when loading 463L pallets that exceed 78" in height.
     30.2.5. All netted 463L pallets less than 8,000 lbs, are limited to 100 inches in height,
     netted 463L pallets from 8001 lbs -10,000lbs are limited to 96 inches.
     30.2.6. When 20 or more passengers/troops are planned for the C-17, leave a pallet
     position open to accommodate palletized baggage.
     30.2.7. For more specific guidance consult TO 1C-17A-9.
  30.3. KC-10 Aircraft:
     30.3.1. The KC-10 has the capability to carry twenty-two 463L pallets side by side
     (pallet positions 2-12, left and right) in the aircraft rail system. These pallets will be
     oriented 88 inches wide and 108 inches long. There is only a one-inch separation
     between pallets at the aircraft centerline; therefore, no lateral overhang is permitted.
     Ensure the maximum length of 104 inches useable area of the pallet is not exceeded, and
     no lateral projections or lateral overhang exist. The cargo must be contoured on the
     outboard side, along the side wall. The following pallet profiles simplify pallet build up:
        30.3.1.1. For pallet positions 2-10 use Pallet Contour Module “Q” (see Attachment
        12 of this volume).
        30.3.1.2. For pallet positions 11 and 12 use Pallet Contour Module “N” (see
        Attachment 12 of this volume).
        30.3.1.3. Although these simplified profiles may be exceeded, the use of these
        profiles expedites the loading process and reduces the number of pallets rejected. [See
        TO 1C-10(K) A-9 Figures 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 for pallet contours information]
     30.3.2. No provisions allow for floor loading cargo or baggage without special
     authorization. When 10 or more passengers are planned for the KC-10, leave a pallet
     position open to accommodate passenger baggage.
     30.3.3. When planning the KC-10 cargo load, you must consider that there is no in-flight
     jettison capability on this aircraft. When hazardous materials are loaded, they must be
     accessible during flight and must be placed on the contoured side, along the sidewall.
     30.3.4. When loading stacks of empty pallets, place them on one side of the aircraft only
     to prevent binding on each other when positioned in the rail system.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               39


     30.3.5. When cargo on skids or supports is loaded, consideration will be given to placing
     the supports at least 10 inches from the forward and aft edges of the pallets to
     accommodate concentrated load limits pallet positions 6-8.
     30.3.6. Pallet trains can be accommodated in the longitudinal orientation (88 inches wide
     by 217 inches long). The separation of the pallets in the rail system is only one inch and
     requires a special coupler (marked for KC-10’s).
  30.4. Commercial Aircraft:
     30.4.1. See AMCPAM 24-2 V1, Civil Reserve Air Fleet Load Planning Guide, for
     general planning guidance.
     30.4.2. Specific guidance on capabilities and limitations associated with a specific type
     of commercial aircraft may be obtained by contacting the appropriate carrier
     representative.
     30.4.3. The final responsibility for load planning commercial aircraft rests with the
     specific carrier.
  30.5. C-130 Aircraft:
     30.5.1. The maximum height for cargo/mail loaded in positions 1 through 5 is 100
     inches. (EXCEPTION: There is a pallet height restriction for pallet position 1 if
     overhead rack is installed).
     30.5.2. Ramp pallets (position 6) are limited to a gross weight of 4,664 lbs and 76 inch
     height.
     30.5.3. Safety Aisles (See Figure 1.).
        30.5.3.1. When airlifting passengers, maintain an unobstructed aisleway in the wheel
        well (positions 3 and 4) and ramp area to provide access to emergency exits. This
        aisleway will be a minimum of 14 inches wide between the outer edge of the cargo
        and the aircraft and will begin at the outer edge of the cargo ramp floor. The dual rail
        outboard frame provides 8 inches of this requirement on the main cargo floor. The
        other 6 inches is provided by the pallet/cargo aisleway (reference Figure 1). This
        aisleway should normally be on the left side of the aircraft. Determine the left or
        right side of an aircraft by standing at the rear of the aircraft, facing forward. Cargo
        loaded on the aircraft ramp must provide an 8-inch aisleway beginning at the
        outboard edge of the dual rail outboard frame. Additionally, access to the aft latrine
        facilities requires an 18-inch clear area on the forward left or right side of the ramp
        (reference Figure 1). On C-130E and H (prior to 83-0486) the clear area must be on
        the left side of the pallet. On C-130H (83-0486 and up) the clear area must be on the
        right side of the pallet.
        30.5.3.2. If the ramp aisleway requirement stated above cannot be achieved on
        missions carrying crew only or authorized mission-essential personnel, complete one
        of the following: maintain an aisleway in the wheel well area that provides a
        minimum of 14 inches between the outer edge of the cargo and aircraft. The cargo
        height should not exceed 36 inches above the floor/pallet/platform. Or, establish a
        minimum of 30 inches between the outer edge of cargo and the aircraft with cargo not
        exceeding 60 inches in height from the floor/pallet/platform. The dual rail outboard
 40                                                   AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


          frame provides 8 inches of this requirement on the main cargo floor. Note: On all
          missions, cargo will be loaded in such a way that the crew will have access to the rear
          of the aircraft. Loads in Section VI of TO 1C-130A-9 are specific and do not require
          a waiver.
       30.5.4. When 20 or more passengers/troops are planned for the C-130, leave a pallet
       position open to accommodate palletized baggage. For more specific guidance, consult
       TO 1C-130A-9.

AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   41


   30.6. KC-135 Aircraft:
       30.6.1. Loose cargo and mail may be loaded in cargo baggage bins secured in the aircraft
       or floor loaded.
       30.6.2. Warehouse skid mounted cargo may be loaded using warehouse pallet jacks and
       secured with tie-downs. Plywood shoring must be used to protect the cargo floor when
       using pallet jacks.
       30.6.3. Build pallets no higher than 65 inches with appropriate contour (see Figure 2).
       30.6.4. No overhang is allowed on any side of the pallet.
       30.6.5. When possible, a 6-inch aisle will be constructed on the 108-inch side, opposite
       the pallet contour. This aisle way will provide additional space for passenger movement.
       30.6.6. Due to limited jettison capability, certain cargo containers for hazardous
       materials are limited in size to 20 X 48 inches, and 75 lbs per item. Exceptions to these
       size and weight limitations will be on a case-by-case basis; boom operators must ensure
       these containers will fit through the aft emergency escape hatch. Hazardous items that do
       not have the capability to leak, smoke, or damage the aircraft are not limited to these size
       and weight limitations.
       30.6.7. For more specific guidance consult TO 1C-135-9.

Figure 2. KC-135 Pallet Contour Profiles.




31. Storage Grid and Bay Locations. Establish a storage grid location system within each air
terminal, according to figures C-6 and C-7 grid/bay locations. Use these figures and this
paragraph as a guide based on facilities, volume of cargo, and storage space. EXCEPTION:

Non-channel aerial ports not generating TWCF cargo are no longer required to segregate cargo
into grid/bay locations. These ports will ensure all cargo is accounted for and maintain database
integrity. Local port management will establish procedures for controlling cargo to ensure
timely movement to final destination.

Section E—Intransit/Terminating Cargo and Mail

32. Intransit Cargo/Mail.
   32.1. General. Handle loose cargo/mail the same as originating.
      32.1.1. For manual procedures, change the receipt and in-check times on prime TCMD
      or manifest records to match aircraft arrival and actual incheck times.
44                                                  AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


     32.1.2. Segregate and position cargo by destination, consignee, priority, etc. Enter into
     GATES the two-digit warehouse bay location (for manual stations annotate the
     appropriate TCMD field with the two-digit bay location).
        32.1.2.1. Do not change the APOE on the prime TCMD record unless the cargo/mail
        was received on a non-TWCF mission. In this case, change the APOE to indicate the
        station processing the shipment and change the APOD to indicate the final AMC
        destination. This change is necessary to ensure billing will occur for each segment of
        movement.
            32.1.2.1.1. A shipment originates at Dover (DOV) and the final destination is
            Sinop (SIO) Turkey. The APOE indicated on the documentation is DOV and the
            APOD is Adana (ADA). When the shipment reaches ADA, change the APOE to
            indicate ADA and change the APOD to indicate SIO.
            32.1.2.1.2. A shipment arrives via surface transportation at Charleston (CHS) and
            the documentation indicates DOV as the APOE. In this case, the APOE requires
            a change to indicate CHS if there is an AMC channel from CHS to the APOD.
            32.1.2.1.3. An example when the APOE should not be changed is when a
            shipment originates at Travis (SUU), the final destination is Ramstein (RMS) and
            the shipment is moved on a TWCF mission from SUU to DOV. Dover would not
            change the APOE to indicate DOV since billing has already occurred from SUU
            to RMS.
  32.2. Procedures. Immediately upon landing at in-transit stations, AMC MICAP/VVIP will
  be processed immediately for onward movement, and when immediately releasing to the
  consignee, processing will not exceed 30 minutes.
     32.2.1. All other cargo/mail will be processed for onward movement as quickly as
     possible, but not to exceed 6 hours after aircraft arrival (block time).
     32.2.2. Quality Control (QC)/inspect all cargo/mail pallets to verify documentation and
     the information on the original DD Form 2775, is correct. Re-placard if necessary.
     Assign a pallet location and process “Cap” the pallet. Do not change the APOE field
     unless cargo/mail was received on a non-TWCF mission.
     32.2.3. Manually check cargo/mail against the accompanying documents to ensure each
     shipment unit is complete and properly documented. Perform a visual inspection of all
     cargo/mail to ensure it is packed, marked, and labeled IAW applicable directives.
        32.2.3.1. For cargo that originates from non-AMC locations, perform the following
        quality checks on at least 10% of all cargo received:
            32.2.3.1.1. Re-measure outside dimensions for over/outsized cargo.
            32.2.3.1.2. Re-measure/weight and re-calculate center of balance (CB) for items
            requiring a CB.
            32.2.3.1.3. Re-weigh items over 1,000 lbs or when weight discrepancies are
            suspected.
            32.2.3.1.4. Correct all markings and re-accomplished placards as required.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                45


        32.2.3.2. For cargo/mail originating from AMC-owned/controlled locations,
        verification is not necessary, unless an obvious discrepancy is detected. (Example:
        documentation does not match marked/placarded weight)
     32.2.4. Refer discrepant shipments and reconcile all irregularities (e.g., packing, marking
     or labeling) with the ACA/CSB prior to acceptance into the AMC airlift system. See
     Section H of this volume for specific guidance.
        32.2.4.1. The CSB is responsible for the preparation of SF 364, Report of
        Discrepancy, IAW DTR Part II, Chap. 210, on shipment frustrations that result in a
        delay or additional packaging costs at CONUS air terminals.
        32.2.4.2. AMC aerial port air freight offices outside of CONUS are responsible for
        the preparation and distribution of all SF 364s prepared on shipments transiting the
        aerial ports.
     32.2.5. Ports must ensure proper customs documentation is received for and
     accompanies each personal property shipment to final destination. Some overseas
     countries require unique customs documentation. Contact your local ACA/CSB or
     Traffic Management Office TMO for specific requirements.
        32.2.5.1. Overseas ports must ensure a DD Form 1252/1252-1, US Customs
        Declaration for Personal Property Shipments, is received for each personal property
        shipment terminating in the Customs Territory of the United States (CTUS) IAW
        DTR Part V.
     32.2.6. Ensure the name of the carrier and CBL/GBL number are clearly identified on
     Code J pallets pre-built by carriers.
     32.2.7. At manual stations, enter the GMT hour code and last two digits of the Julian
     date in the appropriate field of the TCMD when the cargo/mail is completely processed
     for onward movement.
     32.2.8. Landbridge Cargo Procedures. Landbridge is to be utilized for cargo moving by
     commercial air or surface transportation from one port to another where GATES
     capability exists on both ends.
        32.2.8.1. Cargo destined for other APODs may be moved on positioning, de-positioning,
        or opportune airlift when there is onward air movement forecasted to depart within 24
        hours. This is for cargo destined for final delivery at the same installation where the
        aircraft and aerial port are located. Landbridging is also for cargo transshipped through
        an APOE having an established channel route to the APOD IAW the current AMC Air
        Channel Sequence Listing. The latest version can be downloaded from the World Wide
        Web at: https://AOC.scott.af.mil/directorates/xog/analysis.asp. All other cargo will be
        turned over to the local traffic management office TMO for onward movement to its
        ultimate destination.
            32.2.8.1.1. Assuming the air channel in the channel sequence listing is from
            Travis AFB to Yokota AB.
                32.2.8.1.1.1. The shipment arrives at Dover AFB with the ultimate
                destination of Yokota AB. The shipment could move via opportune air (24-
                hour rule) or landbridge to Travis AFB only.
 46                                                   AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


                  32.2.8.1.1.2. The shipment arrives at Joint Base Lewis-McChord with a
                  destination of MacDill AFB. This shipment does not qualify as a landbridge
                  shipment and must be turned over to the TMO for onward commercial
                  movement to MacDill AFB, because the cargo is not returning to the airlift
                  system.
      32.2.9. Opportune airlift within the CONUS. The cargo departing an AMC port with a
      destination in the CONUS may be shipped opportune airlift if the APOD is the final
      destination. The opportune airlift may be used if cargo is not held for more than 24
      hours. The shipments made under this subparagraph must not require any onward
      movement from this APOD. Additionally, opportune airlift may be used on a case-by-
      case basis for any shipment that the opportune airlift will carry from origin to final
      destination, thus meets the intent of DTR, Part II, Cargo Movement, Chapter 202.
          32.2.9.1. Cargo requiring expeditious/rapid parts movement such as agile logistics,
          999, and MICAP should not be held for opportune airlift. Opportune airlift will only
          be used if readily available at the time of air inbound receipt. The movement should
          be by the most expeditious mode available to meet time definite standards.
33. Terminating Cargo/Mail.
   33.1. General. Segregate and position cargo by destination, consignee, priority, etc. For
   manual procedures, annotate the appropriate TCMD field with the two-digit bay warehouse
   location. AMC possession time terminates when the cargo/mail is released to the carrier or
   consignee.
   33.2. Procedures.
      33.2.1. At terminating stations, AMC MICAP/VVIP will be processed immediately for
      onward movement, and when immediately releasing to the consignee, processing will not
      exceed 30 minutes.
      33.2.2. All other cargo/mail will be processed within 6 hours of aircraft arrival (block
      time).
      33.2.3. Manual stations will enter the GMT hour code and last two digits of the Julian
      date in the appropriate field of the TCMD when the cargo/mail is completely processed
      for turnover to the receiving agency. At manual stations, enter this time in the date
      shipped field of the TCMD.
   33.3. Remove aRFID tags attached to the pallets when the nets are removed. Flip the
   battery, rendering the tag inoperable, until it is ready to be reused. Reuse these tags to the
   greatest extent possible. Note: Do not remove aRFID tags from pallets that retain their
   capped status for movement beyond the APOD. If a pallet containing a tag is “uncapped,”
   and the cargo configuration is changed, rewrite the tag with the newest pallet information
   when the pallet is recapped.
   33.4. Traffic Management Process. See AFI 24-203 for receipt processing requirements.
34. Cargo/Mail Inventory.
   34.1. General. In order to reconcile transportation records (including the GATES database)
   with cargo and mail actually on hand, the aerial port/air terminal will conduct a daily
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                47


  physical inventory of all air outbound and terminating cargo and mail. In addition to an
  account of cargo on hand, quality control actions to include verification of location of cargo,
  physical appearance (e.g. leaks, damage, and condition of packages, etc.) will be
  accomplished. Port leadership will designate functions responsible for inventory and quality
  control actions. Use GATES Hand Held Terminals (HHT) when available. Note: Small
  terminal operations, locations, Dets, that are not manned for 24/7 operations do not have to
  perform inventory on days of non-operation.
     34.1.1. Inventory the security cage and transfer accountability at each shift change. The
     security cage inventory will be jointly accomplished by the outgoing and oncoming
     shifts. Single shift operations will inventory the security cage twice daily, at the
     beginning and end of the duty day. Two shift operations will inventory the security cage
     at the beginning of the first shift, jointly at shift change, and at the end of the second
     shift.
     34.1.2. Inventory the explosive storage area at the beginning and end of each shift or
     when there are signs of tampering.
     34.1.3. Geographically separated explosive storage locations are not required to be
     inventoried daily, unless entered. However, at minimal, an inventory will be conducted
     once a week.
     34.1.4. AMC Tenant units with explosives stored in host munitions facilities will
     inventory daily in coordination with the host facility operating hours. (Ex., Monday –
     Friday, 0730 - 1630)
     34.1.5. An inventory of the security cage or the explosive storage area is not required on
     days when operations are closed.
  34.2. Procedures. The physical inventory of cargo and mail will encompass the entire
  terminal. The special handling section is responsible for conducting the inventory of all
  special handling cargo and registered mail (cargo and mail that has been receipted for by
  TMO, postal authorities or consignee, but still located in the terminal is exempt from
  inventory). Reconcile cargo or mail on hand, which is either not listed on inventory
  documents or which is listed but not on hand using "can't locate" files, over/short shipment
  procedures, etc., IAW DTR, Part II, AMCI 24-101, Vol. 6 and this volume.
     34.2.1. A copy of the terminating cargo and mail inventory will be maintained by Air
     Freight for a period of 30 days to provide historical port data. Dispose of all documents
     IAW       AF       Records     Disposition      Schedule       available    on-line    at
     https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rds/rds_series.cfm.
  34.3. Database Management. Port management will review GATES-Deleted Records
  Report daily to provide reasonable assurance that shipment deletions from the database are
  authorized and documented. This information is available every 24 hours after GATES is
  updated, via GATES reports. The Reason (RSN) code and deletion information list the
  ALPHA deletion code plus the clear text name of the individual who performed the
  transaction. (EXCEPTION: Deletions which are transacted because of a change from
  shipment control to piece control splits, and vice versa, will list an explanation instead of a
  name). Reference AMCI 24-101, Vol. 6 for more details.
 48                                                    AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


35. Release of Cargo/Mail to Consignee Representative.
   35.1. General. Use the TCMDs, quick release document, truck manifest, or other automated
   listing for a receipt on all cargo released to TMO or other consignees. Legibly printed names
   and signatures are required for accountability of all cargo released from the port activity. Air
   Freight will obtain an official written communication from all consignee activities that
   include the name, rank, and organization of individuals authorized to pickup general cargo.
   Include the security clearance of personnel authorized to pickup classified, signature service
   cargo and registered mail. A DD Form 577, Signature Card, local forms, or letter will
   suffice. At overseas locations, indicate each individual's DEROS on the authorization.
   Note: Only US military and US civilians with the appropriate security clearance may sign
   for classified shipments and take custody of them.
      35.1.1. Authorizations are effective for 2 years from issue date. Air Freight will
      establish procedures to ensure outdated authorizations are deleted each month. Local
      management will determine when to return outdated authorizations to issuing
      organization with instructions that a new consignee authorization is required.
      Organization commanders authenticate consignee authorization letters or forms. Note:
      Unit mobility cargo may be turned over to the owning unit or applicable representative
      without an authorization letter.
      35.1.2. Hand-carried letters requesting release of cargo/mail to individuals not identified
      in the official communication will be verified by a return telephone call to the
      authenticating agency of the unit requesting the exception on a case-by-case basis. Air
      freight personnel will obtain signatures from authorized personnel picking up cargo/mail.
      35.1.3. The Air Mail Terminal (AMT) will identify personnel who are authorized to
      receipt for registered mail on a local access list and/or DD Form 577. United States
      Postal Service (USPS) is not required to furnish a list of employees who are authorized to
      receipt for mail of any category. All USPS employees are required to carry identification
      cards and, if not recognized, will be asked to present this identification.
      35.1.4. Local AMC commanders or contract equivalent will ensure responsibilities and
      procedures for transfer of air cargo custody are adequately covered under provisions of
      inter-service and/or host tenant support agreements IAW AFI 25-201 Support
      Agreements Procedures, and DODI 4000.19, Interservice and Intragovernmental
      Support.
   35.2. Procedures. Use the TCMDs, quick release document, truck manifest, or other
   automated listing for a receipt on all cargo released to TMO or other consignees. A signature
   is not required when the air terminal and TMO are both under the operational control of
   AMC and located in the same facility. The TMO is responsible for accounting for shipments
   moved and/or released to local consignees.
      35.2.1. Air terminal personnel will obtain a receipt from postal authorities or AMT for
      mail shipments on the DD Form 1384, DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest, or other
      automated listing.
      35.2.2. When TMOs, consignees, or postal authorities arrive at the air terminal, a
      terminal representative will load cargo/mail on vehicles for onward movement to final
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                49


      destination. At locations where aerial port personnel accomplish blocking and bracing,
      establish an OI to cover these procedures.
36. Terminating Cargo/Mail Manifest Control.
   36.1. General. Priority of mission load processing will be determined by aircraft arrival
   time, cargo priority, movement indicators, and SET. The terminating function is responsible
   for in-checking and processing all cargo except registered mail, signature service cargo, and
   AMC MICAP/VVIP, which are accomplished by special handling.
      36.1.1. AMC Form 156, Terminating Cargo/Mail Manifest Control Log, or automated
      product, will be used to log manifests. Maintain locally for 30 days and discard.
   36.2. Procedures.
      36.2.1. As manifests are received, screen them to ensure cargo/mail requiring special
      consideration is processed as soon as possible, e.g., MICAP/VVIP, TP-1 with expedite
      handling indicators, registered mail, biological, signature service, purple sheet/green
      sheet, etc.
      36.2.2. At automated stations, use the inbound manifest or electronic transfer for input to
      the database if no downline manifest is received. Note: Check the manifest destination to
      ensure through-load manifests are not input. Processing can start prior to the computer
      output by using the inbound manifests. The DD Form 1385 will be used for manual in-
      checking IAW DTR, Part II.
          36.2.2.1. Release of terminating cargo during GATES down time or software
          problems that prevent automated release: GATES database problems or loss of
          connectivity should not prevent the timely release of terminating cargo. Use the
          TCMD (or a locally-developed alternative), as an alternate method for manual release
          of cargo. Develop sound procedures to manually record and subsequently reconcile
          database records once GATES connectivity is reestablished, or trouble tickets on
          individual shipments are cleared.
      36.2.3. Automated stations will produce offload processing lists/incheck lists for in-
      processing all cargo/mail. Use the inbound manifest at all other stations for in-
      processing. All stations will use the inbound manifest for in-processing registered mail
      and in-transit pallets.
      36.2.4. All Nuclear War Related Material (NWRM), registered mail, signature service,
      and AMC MICAP/VVIP cargo will be receipted by special handling personnel. An air
      inbound registered mail manifest, truck manifest, or DD Form 1384 will be used for a
      receipt when registered mail is turned over to the postal authorities. The original signed
      copy will become the station file copy. Annotate the terminating manifest control log at
      the time the manifest is delivered to special handling. Air freight officers/TMO, or
      equivalent, may publish a joint OI to cover retrograde processing.
      36.2.5. All cargo and mail must be accounted for during processing. Air Freight
      personnel must make every effort to locate missing cargo/mail by checking the aircraft
      and each cargo/mail handling section, vehicles used to offload the aircraft, etc.
      Document cargo/mail not located IAW paragraph 66 as a short shipment. Document

      cargo received on the mission, but which was not manifested, IAW paragraph 67 as an
      over shipment.
      36.2.6. Ensure all shipments on a mission are accounted for or documented as an
      over/short shipment by adjusting manifest totals, if necessary. The terminating cargo
      processor will sign the manifest and enter the processing GMT hour and date code on the
      manifest. The manifest, offload processing lists or in-check lists will be given to records
      section personnel within 18 hours of aircraft arrival. After the manifest has been
      delivered to the records section, annotate the appropriate column of the AMC Form 156.
      This process is automated at GATES stations.

Section F—. Special Cargo

37. General Information.
   37.1. Definition. Special Cargo is any cargo requiring special handling during acceptance,
   air movement, environmental control, handling, packaging, security, or any combination of
   these factors.
   37.2. Application. Based upon local needs, units will develop procedures and ensure
   necessary support agreements are negotiated for required functional support. Special cargo
   moving on AMC contract missions must be moved IAW the current contract.
38. Special Cargo Inventory.
   38.1. General. The special handling function is responsible for conducting an inventory of
   security cages/rooms, reefers, and hazardous/explosives cargo areas, and will establish
   internal procedures to maintain accountability for security shipments pending load selection
   and manifesting. Under no circumstances will documents reflecting the classification of the
   cargo be attached to the shipment.
   38.2. Security Cage/Room Access. Access to security cages/rooms is restricted to personnel
   who have written authorization from the unit commander, or designated representative. The
   unit commander or designated representative will compile and post an access list, identifying
   authorized personnel and those who require escort, inside the controlled area, near the facility
   entrance.
   38.3. Procedures. Special handling will inventory storage facilities using GATES Hand Held
   Terminals (HHT) when available and generate an AMC Form 214, Security Cage Log and
   Inventory. Stations may use an automated local product in lieu of the AMC Form 214. Initiate
   the AMC Form 214 or other automated product at the closest shift change to 0001 hours local
   each day. Annotate the log as shipments are placed in or removed from the storage facility
   Inventory all cargo in security areas and transfer accountability at the beginning and end of each
   shift. Outgoing and incoming shifts will accomplish inventories jointly. Single shift operations
   will inventory security areas at the beginning and end of the shift. Two shift operations will
   inventory the security cage at the beginning of the first shift, jointly at shift change, and at the
   end of the second shift. Inventory of containerized registered mail will be conducted by the
   seal/listing. Retain AMC Forms 214 or other automated product in the Special Handling Section
   and dispose of IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule available on-line at
   https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rds/rds_series.cfm. An inventory is not required
   during periods when operations are closed.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               51


39. DD Form 1387-2, Special Handling Data/Certification.
   39.1. General. This form is used to identify and provide special handling instructions for
   biological, classified, in-bond, perishable, remains of deceased personnel, and signature
   service shipments when shipped by military air. The shipper will prepare the DD Form
   1387-2 and affix it to each container requiring special handling. The shipper furnishes the
   originating air terminal with two additional copies of the form. The shipper prepares the DD
   Form 1387-2 IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter 205. Note: The DD Form 1387-2 is not to be
   confused with the use of the Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
      39.1.1. When shipments are manifested for airlift, staple one copy of DD Form 1387-2
      for each shipment to the manifest placed aboard the aircraft.
      39.1.2. When shipments covered by DD Forms 1387-2 are offloaded at in-transit
      stations, remove DD Forms 1387-2 from accompanying manifests. When shipments are
      re-manifested, attach DD Forms 1387-2 to the outgoing manifests.
      39.1.3. The air terminal representative loading the special handling shipment at a non-
      AMC station is responsible for ensuring the aircraft commander or designated
      representative is thoroughly briefed on the nature and location of the shipment aboard the
      aircraft, including handling or treatment required.
      39.1.4. Attach the DD Forms 1387-2 for each shipment to the station file copy of the
      manifest and send to the ATOC for inclusion in AMC Form 77, Mission Folder. In-
      transit terminals may reproduce completed DD Forms 1387-2 as necessary.
      39.1.5. When a shipment requires onward movement by a commercial mode of
      transportation, give TMO the DD Form 1387-2 along with the inbound manifest.
40. Classified, Security and TPS Cargo Shipments.
   40.1. Identification. It is the shipper’s responsibility to notify the air terminal when a
   shipment is classified, the degree of classification, if it requires security protection, and
   whether it is hazardous.
   40.2. Application. Provide signature service for the following types of shipments:
      40.2.1. Material classified SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL.
      40.2.2. Sensitive shipments.
      40.2.3. Others requiring special handling in exceptional cases:

          processed).
   40.3. Custodial Responsibility. The above shipments will be airlifted under the care of a
   crew member on military missions and tendered to the contractor for transportation
   protective service (TPS) handling on contract commercial missions. APS/AMC commanders
52                                                     AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


  must appoint in writing Aerial Port/air terminal representatives authorized to receipt for
  classified shipments (including AA&E, NWRM, and Registered Mail). All air terminal
  representatives who receipt for classified shipments must possess a security clearance equal
  to or higher than the highest classification of the affected shipment and will be identified on a
  local authorization letter. Aircrew member security clearance will appear in the flight orders.
  Alternatively, when appropriate, the shipments may be moved under the care of an
  authorized escort/courier on military and/or contract missions. Couriers will be selected by
  ATOC in conjunction with passenger service IAW AMCI 24-101, Vol. 9.
  40.4. Handling. When unescorted classified shipments are under the care of the aircraft
  commander or a designated representative arrive at destination, immediately notify the
  consignee of the arrival of the shipment and obtain a receipt when the shipment is turned
  over to the consignee. TOP SECRET shipments will be accepted for movement by AMC
  IAW DODM 5200.01-/AFI 31-401, Information Security Program.
  40.5. Custodial Transfer.
     40.5.1. The GATES/CMOS manifest or DD Form 1907, Signature Tally Record, will be
     used to transfer custody of shipments requiring special security precautions (e.g.,
     NWRM) IAW AFI 24-203 into the AMC airlift system. Terminate the transfer document
     offered by the shipper and file with other transportation documents arriving with the
     shipment.
     40.5.2. Only US military and US civilians with the appropriate security clearance may
     sign for classified shipments and take custody of them.
     40.5.3. Terminal personnel will deliver material to the selected escort or aircrew
     members. The signature and printed name and rank of the recipient on the air manifest
     indicate confirmation of delivery. The person relinquishing custody of the shipment will
     always retain a signed copy of the manifest. Send the signed copy to ATOC for inclusion
     in AMC Form 77. The escort or aircrew member retains the remaining manifest copies
     for subsequent transfer at en route or final destination stations.
     40.5.4. Signature service cargo placed on pallets that contain general cargo will be
     handled on an individual shipment basis and will not be consolidated. Shipments moved
     in this manner will be visibly identifiable for accountability and proper transfer between
     Air Freight/crew members and/or couriers.
     40.5.5. The terminal representative at enroute stations, transship points or final
     destination, will relieve the escort or aircrew member of the material upon arrival. The
     escort or aircrew member will retain a signed manifest copy for personal records and
     transfer the remaining manifest copies to the terminal representative. Terminal
     representatives are not required to relieve escorts or aircrew members during standard
     ground times and where there is not a change of aircrews.
         40.5.5.1. En Route Transfer.        When an aircraft maintenance or operational
         emergency dictates an extended ground time at an enroute location, an appropriate air
         terminal representative will accept responsibility for the cargo upon aircraft arrival.
         Terminal personnel will determine whether the intransit Signature Service cargo
         should remain on the aircraft (if the aircraft is to be secured/sealed) or be
         transported/stored in the terminal’s secure area. In either event, the air terminal will
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 53


         relieve the aircrew of custody. Prior to aircraft departure, an aircrew member will
         again take responsibility for the cargo by signing the cargo manifest.
         40.5.5.2. Direct Transfer. If extended ground time is not projected, direct transfer
         between escorts or aircrew members may be accomplished at an enroute station
         where the outbound escort or appropriate aircrew member is available to relieve the
         inbound escort or aircrew member within 30 minutes. If outbound escort or aircrew
         personnel are not available, an appropriate air terminal representative will accept
         responsibility and sign for the cargo.
         40.5.5.3. The transfer cycle continues until the cargo is delivered to the consignee or
         a consignee representative. If the cargo is manifested to the consignee or
         representative, a GATES/CMOS manifest or DD Form 1907 must be accomplished
         by the APOD. These documents will serve as verification of final delivery.
  40.6. Security. All classified/security cargo will be safeguarded while in the custody of the
  air terminal. Notify the appropriate base security agency of requirements for armed guard
  surveillance of cargo within the terminal complex, or on AMC aircraft (DoDM 5200.01/AFI
  31-101). Present the local access authorization to the aircrew member prior to transfer of
  custody and receipt of a classified shipment.
  40.7. Split Shipments. Classified and security cargo shipments will not be split after being
  received into the airlift system unless it is necessary for palletization purposes or because a
  single shipment exceeds the airlift capability of a single aircraft. Maintain shipment integrity
  when splitting shipments for palletization purposes. Shipments that are split because the
  entire shipment exceeds a single aircraft capability will be shipped on the minimum number
  of aircraft possible.
  40.8. Discrepant Shipments. Classified and security cargo shipments that are damaged, or
  that have improper documentation, packaging, markings or labeling, will be refused at
  originating stations unless arriving by commercial conveyance or frustrated if intransit. All
  documents used to account for the transfer of signature/security service cargo must reflect the
  correct commodity/special handling code and risk category code for special handling.
     40.8.1. Originating Station. When discrepancies exist on signature service shipments, do
     not accept shipments arriving by modes other than commercial conveyance into the AMC
     airlift system until the discrepancy is corrected. Immediately frustrate the shipment to
     ACA/CSB for corrective action. Accept shipments arriving via commercial conveyance
     and receipt for on DD Form 1907.
     40.8.2. Terminating or Enroute Stations. When discrepancies exist with signature/
     security service shipments, add a written statement to the manifest describing the
     discrepancy. The responsible aircrew member and air terminal representative will sign
     the statement. Receipt for shipment using normal procedures.
     40.8.3. In all cases of discrepancies, frustrate the shipment. Place it in the security cage
     and initiate an AMC Form 33, Report of Frustrated Cargo. After the ACA/CSB, or
     equivalent, has completed corrective action, the shipment will continue movement in the
     airlift system. Note: AMC Form 1015 will be used to frustrate hazmat shipments in lieu
     of AMC Form 33.
 54                                                    AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


      40.8.4. Check the TCMD, DD Form 1387, and the packing list to obtain the correct
      information for the shipment. Contact the originating station by phone or message to
      ascertain the classification or sensitivity of the shipment. If necessary, follow-up with the
      originating station for the discrepancy report, as appropriate.
   40.9. Traffic Management Process for TPS Shipments.
      40.9.1. AMC Form 438, AMC INTRANSIT TPS MATERIAL WORKSHEET: The
      AMC Form 438, AMC INTRANSIT TPS MATERIAL WORKSHEET, provides a
      worksheet for processing intransit TPS shipments. TOs must use this worksheet to
      process intransit TPS material for movement. Utilize the appropriate section when
      processing shipments moving from OCONUS to CONUS or CONUS to OCONUS, each
      block must be completed and initialed. When complete the preparer will sign and date
      the bottom of the form.
      40.9.2. Certifications will be accomplished by a 7-level, 2T0/2T2 technical sergeant or
      above, or civilian equivalent (based on the unit manning document). Once reviewed for
      accuracy the certifier will sign and date the AMC Form 438.
      40.9.3. Temporary waiver authority for a certified, 5-level Staff Sergeant or civilian
      equivalent will be at the LRS/APS commander level. The individual performing the task
      and the certifiers cannot be the same person. Note: A sample AMC Form 438 is located
      at Attachment 7 of this volume.
41. Remains of Deceased Personnel.
   41.1. General. Transportation of deceased military personnel, and other remains, when
   authorized by AMC, is authorized between overseas and CONUS IAW AFI 34-242,
   Mortuary Affairs Program. Whenever possible, restrict movement of remains to cargo/dual
   configured airlift missions. Baggage compartment space on passenger type aircraft may be
   used when satisfactory service cannot be accomplished on cargo missions.
   41.2. Handling.
      41.2.1. Ensure on/offloading is accomplished discreetly and in a dignified manner (at no
      time should load team or any personnel stand, sit, or lean on HR transfer case). Do not
      on/offload human remains concurrently with passengers/patients.
      41.2.2. Shipments will move on a separate manifest, using the manifest as a hand-to-
      hand receipt.
      41.2.3. Transfer cases containing remains will be stowed on the aircraft/pallet in a level
      position. The feet will never be higher than the head while in the stowed position. The
      head will always be stowed toward the nose of the aircraft. This procedure assures
      aircraft acceleration forces are borne by the feet, thereby avoiding trauma to the head.
      When loaded, transfer cases should be loaded in the forward most available cargo
      position in the event jettisoning is necessary. Note: On wide body aircraft (e.g., C-5, C-
      17) transfer cases can be moved from one side of the aircraft to the other in the event
      jettisoning is required. Therefore, transfer cases may be loaded towards the rear of the
      aircraft if required.
      41.2.4. No cargo will be loaded on top of transfer cases containing human remains.
      However, if more than one transfer case containing remains is shipped or stored, stacking
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  55


      is permitted, but should be avoided if at all possible. The maximum number of human
      remains transfer cases that may be safely transported on a single 463L pallet is 12. Place
      cases in three rows, each row stacked to a maximum of four.
      41.2.5. When remains are received at an AMC terminal they will be stored in a secure
      area and separate from other cargo. If remains are not embalmed, refrigerated storage is
      required and when refrigeration is not available, contact Installation Mortuary Affairs
      Officer.
      41.2.6. Move remains on a space-required basis, using applicable DOD documentation
      procedures. (See DODD 1300.22, Mortuary Affairs Program and AFI 34-242)
      41.2.7. The shipping activity should provide the origin APOE with the following
      information as applicable, as far in advance as possible:
         41.2.7.1. Military personnel: name, grade, and SSN.
         41.2.7.2. Civilian employees: name, grade, SSN, and employment data.
         41.2.7.3. Contract Engineering and Technical Services (CETS) personnel: name, and
         employment data.
         41.2.7.4. Dependents of military personnel and civilian employees: name of
         decedent; name, grade, SSN, and organization (or employment data) of the sponsor;
         relationship to sponsor
         41.2.7.5. Other United States citizens:      name of decedent, name and address of
         sponsoring individual, agency or firm.
      41.2.8. The shipper marks the case with name and address of receiving funeral director.
      41.2.9. The shipper ensures a DD Form 2064, Certificate of Death (Overseas),
      preferably in English, is affixed to the transfer case of deceased personnel. If the
      certificate is not in English, the shipper provides a statement in English, stating the cause
      of death.
      41.2.10. See AMCI 24-101, Vol. 9, Attachment 6, for additional guidance.
42. AMC Mission Capability (MICAP)/Very Very Important Parts (VVIP) and Forward
Supply System (FSS) Shipments.
   42.1. General. Document, process, handle, and deliver AMC MICAP/VVIP and FSS
   shipments IAW AFPD 23-1, Materiel Management, and AMCI 23-102, Expeditious

      42.2.1. Transfer AMC MICAP and VVIP shipments on a hand receipt basis using the
      cargo manifest.
      42.2.2. ATOC will coordinate with 618 AOC/APCC to move AMC MICAP and VVIP
      on the mission providing the earliest arrival at destination.
      42.2.3. Limit AMC MICAP/VVIP and FSS items transported aboard commercial
      passenger flights to small items that can be loaded in the cargo/baggage compartment.
      Use of passenger aircraft is at the discretion of aerial port management with the following
      conditions:
          42.2.3.1. AMC MICAP cargo does not take precedence over space required
          passengers; however, such items may displace space available passengers if weight is
          the limiting factor rather than number of seats.
      42.2.4. The Special Handling Section will have the cargo available to Supply or TMO
      for pickup as soon after aircraft arrival as possible, but not later than 30 minutes after
      receipt.
      42.2.5. File AMC Form 35, Terminating AMC MICAP/VVIP Control Log, and AMC
      Form 36, Originating AMC MICAP/VVIP Control Log, in the special handling section

      https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rds/rds_series.cfm.
      42.2.6. The same procedures/controls outlined for AMC MICAP will be used for
      contract aircraft revenue route support parts.
43. Frozen, Chilled and Perishable Shipments.
   43.1. General. Expedite movement of shipments requiring freezing, refrigeration and re-
   icing. Provide all such shipments preferential handling within the guidelines of SET,
   movement indicators, and assigned movement priority, and use missions providing minimum
   total transit time.
      43.1.1. Maintain refrigeration units between 35 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 8
      degrees Celsius). Inspect refrigeration units for appropriate temperature range each shift
      change. A local form may be developed to record these inspections. Variations above or
      below maximum and minimum temperatures specified on intransit shipments in storage
      require immediate action.
      43.1.2. Use AMC Form 106, Biologicals/Re-icing/Refrigeration Log, to document re-
      icing/ refrigeration actions and control of all items requiring freezing or refrigeration.
      Special handling personnel will monitor and record shipments requiring re-
      icing/refrigeration during storage on the AMC Form 106, Shift supervisors will review
      this log at the beginning of each shift to ensure re-icing is accomplished as necessary.
      All entries on the AMC Form 106 will be legible and entered in Greenwich Mean Time
      (GMT).
   43.2. Receipt and processing.
      43.2.1. Upon receipt of material, review accompanying DD Form 1502, Frozen Medical

     documents/forms/package markings for re-icing or refrigeration/storage requirements, as
     applicable, to the shipment.
     43.2.2. If re-icing will become due prior to arrival of a shipment at the next transfer point
     or destination, the shipment will be re-iced before forwarding. Non-hazardous shipments
     may be opened, re-iced and resealed by the special handling personnel. When a question
     arises concerning preservation or condition of frozen food or chilled perishables, contact
     the military public health service for assistance.
         43.2.2.1. Complete DD Form 1502, DD Form 1502-1, or DD Form 1502-2 as
         applicable. For non-medical shipments, ports should create a DD Form 1502, DD
         Form 1502-1, or DD Form 1502-2, as applicable (delete the word "Medical" from the
         form and disregard requirements on the forms specific to medical shipments). To
         assure accuracy in data, when completing the form, use Julian date and Zulu
         (Greenwich Mean Time) to compensate for shipments between time zones. Note:
         Only perishable non-medical material transiting through another aerial port will
         require the DD Form 1502.
         43.2.2.2. Ensure the proper amount of dry or wet ice, as applicable, is used when a
         shipment is forwarded. If the dry ice quantity is different from the original shipment,
         change the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods to reflect the change.
  43.3. Specific re-icing restrictions.
     43.3.1. Infectious substance shipments (UN2814 or UN2900), as defined by AFMAN
     24-204_IP, must only be opened, checked, re-iced, and resealed by technical escorts,

     shipment cannot reach its destination within 15 days since the material was packed (date
     listed on label of shipment), then contact a cold chain representative for repacking. The
     cold chain contact information is listed on the cold chain management orange handling
     label attached to the shipment IAW AFJI 41-208, /DLAR 4145.21, Preparation of
     Medical Materiel Requiring Freeze or Chill Environment for Shipment.

44. Registered Mail.
   44.1. Mail Security and Handling. Official registered mail may contain up to and including
   SECRET material, therefore, always protect and handle as classified cargo. Personal
   registered mail does not include classified documents; however, it is afforded the same
   degree of security afforded official registered mail. All registered mail must be safeguarded
   and provided a complete audit trail within the DTS (reference paragraph 34 for inventory
   procedures). U.S. citizens, military or civilian, must have a valid national agency check,
   local agency checks and credit check (NACLC) for military and Access National Agency
   Check With Written Inquiries (ANACI) for Civilians, on file to handle (without opening)
   individual pieces of registered mail. Note: Only U.S. military or U.S. civilians with
   appropriate qualifications may sign for and take custody of classified shipments.
      44.1.1. When registered mail is in the custody of Air Freight, it is to be secured IAW the
      AMC supplement to DoDM 5200.01/AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
      Management. When this requirement cannot be met, post a U.S. citizen employee to
      protect registered mail (need not be armed).
      44.1.2. Registered mail and classified cargo (special handling codes 5, 6, 8, c, and s)
      should be moved via U.S. military aircraft whenever possible. However, registered mail
      and classified cargo may be transferred to an AMC contract air carrier without flight deck
      (pilot and copilot) aircrew members providing documentation of a security clearance if
      the individual signing for the cargo is a U.S. citizen (having in possession a U.S. issued
      passport).
      44.1.3. In the rare instances where no member of the flight deck crew is a U.S. citizen or
      when there will be a known crew change at an enroute station, do not move registered
      mail and/or classified cargo on that mission.
      44.1.4. Classified cargo (up to top secret) may be transported on contract aircraft without
      regard to nationality of the aircrew, if the cargo is under the custody of properly cleared
      escorts/couriers or defense courier personnel.
      44.1.5. For other items requiring hand-to-hand receipt (signature service), there is no
      requirement to verify the crewmembers are U.S. citizens.
      44.1.6. Ordinary mail may be handled by foreign nationals, when designated and
      authorized in writing by the squadron commander or detachment chief (contract
      equivalent).
   44.2. Containerization Procedures. Air terminals originating large volumes of registered
   mail to specific locations may containerize registered mail for ease of transfer to aircrew
   members at planeside. Stations and aircrew members must comply with the following
   procedures when originating and receiving containerized mail shipments:
      44.2.1. Containers should be tri-wall type boxes and should not exceed 45 inches in
      height.
      44.2.2. The two-person concept will be used to containerize mail.
      44.2.3. Assign pallet identifiers to the container and cap the pallet as a skid using 0.5 in
      the equivalent positions column.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 59


     44.2.4. Create a content listing in triplicate for each container. The listings will include
     the printed names, ranks, organization, and signatures of the individuals containerizing
     the mail and the seal number of the seal used on the container. Special Handling will
     ensure the correct seal number for each container is annotated on the aircraft final
     manifest.
         44.2.4.1. One copy of the listing will be placed inside the container for inventory use
         at the destination station.
         44.2.4.2. The second copy will be affixed to the outside of the container for in-transit
         use and inventory purposes.
         44.2.4.3. The final copy of the listing will be filed in Special Handling.
     44.2.5. Seal containers with packing tape, metal or plastic bands, and boxcar seals as a
     minimum. Containers will be taped shut and the boxcar seal number, as well as both
     individuals' signature, will be prominently annotated across the tape. Containers will be
     banded with four bands, two along the width and two along the length. A boxcar seal
     will then be placed at the band crimp where it cannot be removed should the bands be
     cut.
     44.2.6. Shipments will not be delayed for containerization.
  44.3. Transfer Procedures. At planeside, the terminal representative will sign all registered
  mail manifests indicating the container closures and seals are intact and the seal numbers on
  the containers and manifests match. Discrepancies will be brought to the attention of aerial
  port personnel and corrected before aircraft departure. Pen-and-ink changes to registration
  numbers will not be made, nor will registered mail shipments be hand-scribed onto the final
  manifest. Discrepancies that cannot be corrected before departure will be bumped and a new
  manifest will be generated. One copy of the manifest is signed by the aircrew member
  accepting responsibility for the mail. Aircrew members remain responsible for integrity of
  containers and security of shipments while under their control.
     44.3.1. Receiving aerial port personnel will verify the integrity of container closures and
     seals at planeside. Discrepancies will be brought to the attention of the responsible
     aircrew member and annotated on the manifests. The aircrew member and air terminal
     representative will jointly inspect the container to verify content prior to transfer of
     custody. The two-person concept will be used to incheck and receive shipments into the
     port. Content listings and manifests will be used to inventory and terminate shipments.
     In-checking personnel will also sign the content listings, which will be filed in Special
     Handling. Mail will be transferred to postal personnel IAW existing procedures.
     44.3.2. Loose Registered Mail. Transfer of loose registered mail will occur in the same
     manner as containerized mail except seal numbers of individual pieces will be confirmed.
  44.4. Discrepant Shipments. A discrepant shipment is a registered mail shipment that
  arrives at an originating, terminating or en route station with an irregularity (torn pouch, TCN
  missing, incorrectly manifested, etc.). Containers with discrepancies that void the integrity
  of the container and could result in lost or pilfered material will not be accepted for shipment
  until the contents have been inventoried. Take the following action.
 60                                                  AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


      44.4.1. Originating Station. It is the U.S. Postal Service responsibility to ensure
      registered mail arrives at the port with bar-coded labels.
      44.4.2. Terminating or Enroute Stations. When a shipment arrives and the manifested
      TCN does not match the TCN on the shipment, accomplish the following:
          44.4.2.1. Annotate the manifested line item with the incorrect TCN as a short
          shipment.
          44.4.2.2. Add the shipment to the bottom of the automated manifest or prepare a DD
          Form 1384/1385 and document as an over shipment.
          44.4.2.3. Annotate all copies of the manifest with a statement describing the
          discrepancy. The responsible crew member and air terminal representative will sign
          the statement. Notify the local U.S. Postal Service, which will take action IAW DOD
          4525.8M, DOD Official Mail Manual.
          44.4.2.4. The air terminal representative receipts for the registered mail after the
          specified annotations have been accomplished. The aircrew member will sign to
          confirm discrepancies as annotated.
          44.4.2.5. The Air Freight Officer/Superintendent, or equivalent, initiates over/short
          shipment procedures to solve the discrepancy.
45. Hazardous Materials Handling and Storage.
   45.1. References. AFMAN 24-204_IP contains information and rules for the air transport of
   items which, by virtue of their properties, have been identified as regulated materials when
   entered into the DTS for airlift. Additional references required for air terminal management
   of hazardous materials include:
      45.1.1. Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 100-199 (optional for
      overseas locations).
      45.1.2. AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards.
      45.1.3. International Air Transport Association (IATA) Dangerous Goods Regulation
      (DGR).
      45.1.4. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the
      Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air.
      45.1.5. European Agreement Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods
      (ADR), EUCOM Dangerous Goods Regulations.
   45.2. Hazardous Materials Information File (HMIF). Each AMC air terminal will establish
   procedures to ensure “Inspectors” and “Preparers” have access to messages and
   changes/updates concerning hazardous materials. This may be accomplished by a manual
   file or use of DOD websites.
   45.3. Shipper’s Responsibilities. It is the shipper’s responsibility to ensure complete
   compliance with the appropriate directives. Hazardous materials must be packaged, marked,
   labeled, and certified for military air shipment IAW AFMAN 24-204_IP, Title 49 CFR, the
   ICAO Technical Instruction, or IATA DGR. AMC transportation functions will use AMC
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   61


  Form 1033/1033-1, Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods, or a similar form to certify
  hazardous material shipments. Other shipping documentation will be completed IAW DTR.
  45.4. Hazardous Material Qualifications:
     45.4.1. Hazardous material qualification requirements can be found in AMCI 24-101,
     Vol. 22 and AFMAN 24-204_IP.
     45.4.2. Certification for hazardous materials of deployable assets.
         45.4.2.1. AMC aerial ports and units with a mobility mission will develop and
         maintain a cadre of “Technical Specialist” personnel to certify aerial port equipment
         shipped in support of tasked deployed operations. Local management will determine
         cadre size. “Technical Specialist” training requirements of AFMAN 24-204_IP,
         Attachment 25 apply.
         45.4.2.2. Aerial port teams are not inherently responsible for certifying hazardous
         materials belonging to other Contingency Response Wing (CRW) elements or the
         supported forces. The aerial port element may certify CRW cargo, within the scope
         of their training as a “Technical Specialist”, when other CRW elements lack this
         capability.
  45.5. Inspection and Quality Control. Air Terminal and deployed “Inspectors” will utilize
  the AMC Form 1015, as a minimum, and perform a 100 percent exterior inspection of
  originating hazardous material shipments and associated documentation for compliance with
  AFMAN 24-204_IP and other applicable directives.
     45.5.1. Intransit terminals are not required to document/accomplish a new inspection,
     using an AMC Form 1015, if already performed at originating terminal and Key 6 of the
     Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods is completed IAW para. 45.5.5. or “Received
     and Inspected By (followed by legible printed name and signature of inspector, location,
     and date.)”_____________,” to include the signature of the individual performing the
     inspection, date, and location (three letter code is acceptable) is entered IAW AFMAN
     24-204_IP.
     45.5.2. Perform a random interior inspection (not less than 10 percent) of combination
     packages. Use AFMAN 24-204_IP, Attachment 28, to determine extent of the
     inspection.
         45.5.2.1. Do not open shipping containers other than those authorized in Attachment
         28 that will require recertification unless arrangements have been made with host
         base transportation function for repackaging and recertification.
         45.5.2.2. It is not necessary to open all like packages of a multiple piece shipment.
         45.5.2.3. Target unknown shippers [to include Direct Vendor Delivery (DVD) and
         GPC] for interior inspections. Terminals may increase inspection frequency of a
         specific shipper based on past shipment problems. Frequency of inspection for known
         shippers (e.g., host base transportation function) and those recurring shipments where
         packaging has previously been found to be acceptable may be reduced.. Whenever
         possible, interior inspections of shipments from host base transportation function will
         be accomplished before package closure.
62                                                  AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


     45.5.3. “Inspectors” will have access to all cargo, to include containerized loads
     (CONEXs, MILVANs, Tactical Shelters, ISUs, etc. All containerized loads will be
     inspected to ensure internal contents are secured, no undeclared HAZMAT is present,
     no potential leaks are detected and all compatibility/segregation requirements have
     been met.
        45.5.3.1. If the cargo is determined by the shipper to be “Sight-Sensitive” and
        should be exempt from full inspection, prior approval must be obtained from the
        AMC Director of Operations (AMC/A3) or Director of Logistics (AMC/A4). A copy
        of the approval letter must be provided to the inspector. The shipper will obtain an
        exemption in writing from HQ AMC/A4 or HQ AMC/A3 for protected or sight
        sensitive shipments IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter 205 and this volume. Requests for
        A3/A4 approval must be received from the requesting agency’s Wing/CC level.
        When a sight sensitive approval is issued, inspector access to the cargo will be limited
        to a visual inspection to ensure “safety-of-flight” and to check for undocumented
        hazardous materials. Inspectors will not open individual boxes, safes, or COMSEC
        equipment within containers if transported force unit commander identifies (in
        writing) the inspection will compromise security, unless a discrepancy is identified.
        (Refer to Attachment 10 of this volume for request format.)
     45.5.4. Inspections will be documented using AMC Form 1015.
        45.5.4.1. Use for loose single, multiple or palletized hazardous materials shipped
        under a single TCN. When different HAZMAT Proper Shipping Names are shipped
        under a single TCN (e.g., operations IAW DTR, Part III) only one form needs to be
        accomplished.
        45.5.4.2. The form is not required when a DD Form 2133 is used for non-hazardous
        vehicles and equipment. An AMC Form 1015 is required for secondary loads.
        45.5.4.3. Document in remarks if a package/container is or is not opened for interior
        inspection.
        45.5.4.4. When hazardous material is acceptable for air movement, forward the
        Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods along with documentation of interior
        inspection to Load Planning.
        45.5.4.5. Unacceptable shipments will be processed IAW Section H, paragraph 65.
     45.5.5. When the hazardous materials is determined acceptable for air movement, stamp,
     mark, or label the Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods (Key 6) with the
     statement, “Inspected By (followed by legible printed name and signature of inspector,
     location, and date.)” (three letter code is acceptable). Apply the statement to the copy
     that goes with AMC Form 1015 to Load Planning, to the aircraft commander’s copy and
     to the copy that remains with the shipment. Applying a stamp, marking or label to the
     cargo is optional.
     45.5.6. Periodically, e.g. at shift change, inspect all shipments of hazardous materials
     stored in air terminal facilities. This inspection should be a visual check to ensure no
     leaks or other discrepancies go undetected. If any discrepancies are noted, frustrate the
     cargo utilizing the AMC Form 1015.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               63


  45.6. Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM), Contingency and Exercises. When
  mobility missions are authorized to transport cargo, vehicles, equipment and personnel IAW
  AFMAN 24-204_IP, Chapter 3, Tactical, Contingency, or Emergency Airlift, the statement
  “AFMAN 24-204_IP, Chapter 3 applies” must be included on the Mission Operating
  Directive (MOD) or Mission Detail. When this statement is not included, the hazardous
  material requirements for channel missions pertaining to fuel levels, compatibility,
  packaging, etc., will be followed.
  45.7. Hazardous Material Handling. Ensure safe practices are followed when handling,
  stacking, loading, positioning, and restraining hazardous cargo on a pallet or in an aircraft.
  In addition, pieces of hazardous material shipments will be placed on pallets to permit
  visibility of the special handling labels through the plastic covers. As a minimum, ensure at
  least one piece of each hazard class on the pallet is visible.
     45.7.1. Intransit Explosives Storage.
         45.7.1.1. Use only facilities approved by Host Base Safety Office to store explosives.
         Use AFMAN 24-204_IP to determine explosive compatibility during temporary
         storage unless otherwise directed by Host Base Safety Office.
         45.7.1.2. Write local OIs on accepting, storing, transporting, and handling explosives
         IAW AFMAN 91-201. As a minimum, OIs will address approved explosive
         operation locations, explosive limits, personnel limits, authorized equipment,
         general/specific safety requirements, individual responsibilities, procedural steps,
         security and emergency procedures (dropped explosives, fire, lightning, etc).
         Coordinate OIs with host safety office, fire department, security force, and other
         appropriate agencies.
  45.8. Intransit HAZMAT Storage.
     45.8.1. Prior to load planning, segregate hazardous materials into appropriate hazardous
     storage bays (see Figure 1.) that maximize safety, provide isolation for non-compatible
     items, and protection from the elements. As a minimum, the hazardous cargo area will be
     identified by placards with the words “HAZARDOUS - NO SMOKING.” Bay areas for
     loose HAZMAT and pallet build up grids (to include MMHS) will be approved by host
     base fire department. Aerial ports/terminals will develop local written procedures,
     approved by host base fire department and Safety office, addressing intransit storage,
     handling, transportation of HAZMAT, spill notification and control requirements. Use
     appropriate Department of Transportation (DOT) hazard placard to identify intransit
     storage bay or grid location unless the fire department directs use of other methods of
     emergency identification notification (e.g., NFPA placards). Placards will be removed
     when corresponding HAZMAT is not present. EXCEPTION: DOD placards will be
     used for Explosives Storage.
     45.8.2. When protective clothing/spill control kits is required, units may build kits using
     AFMAN 24-204_IP as guidance or purchase commercial kits that meet or exceed
     AFMAN 24-204_IP requirements. Units will contact base environmental flight (BEF) or
     fire protection personnel to determine adequacy of commercial kits being considered.
     Coordinate the type and level of training required to use protective clothing and spill
     control kits with the BEF and fire department.
64                                                    AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


     45.8.3. Write procedures (e.g., OI) covering responsibilities and actions in the event of a
     hazardous material spill and coordinate them with the appropriate base emergency
     response offices (Fire Department, Security Forces, Bio-environmental, etc).
  45.9. Hazardous Waste. Terminals must notify HQ AMC/A4TC prior to accepting an item
  meeting the definition of a hazardous waste as defined in AFMAN 24-204_IP for shipment
  from, to, or through a domestic location.
     45.9.1. Procedures for accepting, processing, and documenting international military
     airlift of hazardous waste are the same as shipping hazardous materials. Comply with all
     host nation requirements concerning hazardous waste.
     45.9.2. Hazardous materials used during the course of routine aircraft maintenance at
     remote overseas locations should be classified as aircraft assets. Resource Conservation
     Recovery Act (RCRA) requirements apply when the aircraft turns the material in as
     waste after it returns to the United States or one of its territories. Upon landing, the crew
     should remove the hazardous material from the aircraft and determine its disposition. If
     the aircraft, while returning to CONUS or a territory of the United States, stops at another
     overseas location with proper disposal capability, the aircrew should offload the material
     at that location, if allowed. When used in direct support of the aircraft, consider the
     material an aircraft part or component, and therefore not regulated by AFMAN 24-
     204_IP. Hazardous material must be packaged and controlled in such a manner as to
     prevent spillage or leakage during flight.
  45.10. Foreign-Owned or Controlled Aircraft. Hazardous material scheduled for movement
  aboard foreign owned or controlled aircraft must be packaged, marked, labeled, and certified
  according to applicable AFMAN 24-204_IP, Title 49 CFR, IATA, and/or ICAO regulations.
  Commercial air carriers must obtain the required exemptions to Title 49 CFR from the DOT.
     45.10.1. Incompatible hazardous material cannot be shipped on foreign flag commercial
     carriers not operating under DOT-E 9232 without approval from the DOT. A copy of the
     DOT approval (e.g., CAA) must be available prior to loading.
     45.10.2. Incompatible hazardous material may be shipped on foreign military aircraft if
     approved according to AFMAN 16-101, International Affairs and Security Assistance
     Management, by the foreign government. A copy of the approval document must be
     available prior to loading (contact HQ AMC/A4TC if copy is not provided).
  45.11. Non-AMC controlled US flag aircraft transporting hazardous materials.
     45.11.1. Do not load hazardous materials on commercial aircraft not operating under an
     AMC contract without approval from HQ AMC/A4TC.
     45.11.2. Hazardous materials loaded on non-AMC military aircraft must be in
     compliance with AFMAN 24-204_IP, Attachment 18. Incompatible items may only be
     loaded with approval of appropriate Service/MAJCOM authority IAW AFMAN 24-
     204_IP, Chapter 2.
  45.12. Split Shipments. It is not necessary to create multiple “True Copies” IAW AFMAN
  24-204_IP, Attachment 17, when a TCN is “split” by the terminal and the shipment is loaded
  on the same aircraft/mission and there will be no trans-load at an enroute terminal. Annotate
  TCN “splits” on the back of the Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               65


   45.13. Chemically Treated Lumber. Creosote oil treated lumber and Pentachlorophenol
   (PCP) treated wood are not regulated as hazardous materials; however, care must be taken
   during handling. Creosote oil treated lumber must be individually or bulk wrapped in kraft
   wax paper. PCP treated wood must be handled with gloves.
   45.14. Leaking Cargo. Hazardous materials shipments will be “impounded” when there is a
   leak or release of contents during flight or during on-loading/off-loading. Do not forward
   shipment for onward movement until released/approved by Bioenvironmental Engineering
   and/or Fire Department.
46. Radioactive Materials.
   46.1. Visually examine all radioactive labeled shipments, for any evidence of leakage or
   damage upon receipt. As necessary, notify responsible agencies IAW established procedures
   (see paragraph 45).
   46.2. Establish local base, inter-Service, or host base support agreements with
   Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight or other responsible agency for assistance in
   monitoring the Transport Index (TI) and Surface Reading (SR) prior to re-certifying a
   Radioactive Material White Label, Yellow II or Yellow III frustrated shipment.
   46.3. While a Shipper's Declaration completed IAW AFMAN 24-204_IP is not required for
   items labeled "Radioactive Material, Excepted Packages", treat as radioactive material in all
   other regards pertaining to inspection, handling and intransit storage.
   46.4. Aerial ports/terminals will continue to inspect radioactive shipments for evidence of
   damage and shipper compliance with marking/labeling, packaging , and certification
   requirements found in AFMAN 24-204_IP and complete the AMC Form 1015 according to
   AMCI 24-101, Vol 11. The host base radiation safety officer (RSO) within the
   Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (BEF) or the responsible radiation safety agency/office
   at non- AF locations should be contacted concerning any local requirements to monitor/scan
   radioactive shipments while in in-transit storage awaiting shipment. Recommend procedures
   for handling damaged or leaking radioactive shipments be addressed IAW AMCI 24-101,
   Vol 11, para 45.8.3 to ensure compliance with AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials
   in the USAF, Attachment 11, Reporting Criteria and Attachment 12, Radioactive Material
   Incident and Accident Checklist. Non-AF locations should comply with host Service
   incident/accident reporting requirements.
      46.4.1. Should it become necessary for the radioactive material to be re-certified by an
      aerial port/terminal preparer qualified individual (i.e., CSB), the shipment must be
      scanned/monitored to ensure readings are correct prior to shipment. This may be
      accomplished by the host base RSO/BEF or other responsible radiation safety
      agency/office.
47. Emergency, Valuable, and Arms, Ammunition & Explosives (AA&E) Shipments.
   47.1. Emergency Shipments. These shipments contain biologicals or other medical supplies
   of such urgency that human life is dependent upon immediate receipt. The shipper will
   establish life or death urgency requirements.
      47.1.1. These shipments will be exempt from SET and will be moved on the first
      available mission that will provide the most expeditious movement to the shipment
66                                                  AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


     destination. Transfer between aircraft at en route stations if such transfer will expedite
     movement.
     47.1.2. Manifest these shipments separately and annotate the manifest with the words
     "LIFE OR DEATH URGENCY”. Handle all emergency shipments on a hand-to-hand
     receipt basis. The aircraft commander will be briefed on the urgency of the shipment and
     made the custodian during flight.
     47.1.3. Patient Care Shipments. Patient care shipments are medical supplies of an
     urgency slightly less crucial than life or death urgency. Such shipments normally have an
     early RDD because they are needed for scheduled surgery, have a short shelf life, etc.
     Patient care shipments are exempt from SET and moved on the first available mission to
     effect the most expeditious movement to destination. Shipments are identified on the air
     manifest as patient care by trailer record data. Patient care shipments are processed and
     turned over to the consignee or consignee representative as soon as possible after receipt
     at shipment destination.
  47.2. Valuable Shipments. Render special care to shipments of an extremely valuable nature
  to prevent loss.
     47.2.1. When shipments of money or bullion are transported via AMC, they will be
     moved on a hand receipt basis. Give these shipments the same treatment given to
     classified cargo.
     47.2.2. If not addressed in the Integrated Defense Plan (IDP), develop written procedures
     for the handling, storing and transporting (on-base) shipments of protected, sensitive,
     money, bullion, and other items of extraordinary value to meet protection requirements of
     AFI 31-101, AMC Sup 1. Coordinate procedures with the host base Security Forces.
  47.3. Arms, Ammunition and Explosive (AA&E) Shipments.
     47.3.1. Provide shipments of AA&E secure storage as required by AFI 31-101, AMC
     Sup 1; AFI 24-203; and DOD 5100.76M, Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional
     Arms, Ammunition and Explosives. Develop written procedures (e.g., OI), if not in the
     Integrated Defense Plan, addressing terminal requirements and responsibilities during
     handling, storage and transportation. Coordinate procedures with the host base Security
     Forces. See Table 3. below for security requirements.
     47.3.2. Always handle shipments with air commodity/special handling codes 21 through
     28, 2C, 2S, 31 through 38, 3C, 3S, 41 through 48, 4C and 4S on a signature service basis
     using the cargo manifest.

48. Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Missions.
   48.1. General. Hazardous materials will not be transported on aeromedical evacuation (AE)
   missions except for those materials that are approved by the local AE representative. (See
   AFI 11-2AEV3, Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Operations Procedures, Paragraph 6.29. for
   more specific information.)
49. In-Bond Shipments.
   49.1. General. There may be instances where cargo cannot enter the US in the name of
   AMC or DOD, because customs entry hasn’t been arranged by the shipper. In these cases,
   cargo may be sent from the port of entry “in-bond” under the Customs and Border Protection,
   (CBP) Form 7512, Transportation Entry and Manifest of Goods Subject to CBP Inspection
   and Permit. The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection holds the carrier responsible for
   non-delivery or short delivery of in-bond shipments.
   49.2. Originating Station. CBP Form 7512 will accompany in-bond shipments that require
   forwarding from the port of entry. Affix red US Customs warning labels to two sides of the
   package. If the labels cannot be glued to the package, securely wire two of the tags to the
   package. Since AMC does not provide scheduled operations within the US, send in-bond
   shipments from the AMC APOD to destination via bonded common carriage. Transfer of in-
   bond shipments to a bonded common carrier must be made under supervision of the U.S.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              69


   Customs inspector, if available. If not, the air freight OIC, or his/her representative must
   complete the reverse side of CBP Form 7512 (the reason for transshipment and conditions of
   the shipment).
   49.3. Destination Station. If the AMC station is the final destination of the in-bond
   shipment, deliver the manifest copy of CF 7512 and the in-bond cargo to the Collector of US
   Customs, or representative. Air Freight prepares and forwards a copy of CF 7529, Carriers
   Certificate and Release Order, IAW AMCI 24-101, Vol. 9, Military Airlift-Air Terminal
   Operations Center, to the consignee. Include information that the shipment has been
   delivered to the Collector of U.S. Customs. The consignee must present a copy of this form
   to U.S. Customs before release of the shipment to the consignee.
50. Diplomatic Clearance Cargo. Receive, process, and document diplomatic clearance cargo
IAW procedures outlined in AMCI 24-101, Vol. 9, and DOD 4500.54G, DOD Foreign
Clearance Guide. Port hold time is computed from the date/time the approved clearance
becomes effective.

Section G—. - Cargo Requiring Additional Considerations.

51. General. The following procedures provide guidance for handling cargo/mail shipment
requiring additional consideration due to unique requirements or other special circumstances.
52. Personal Property.
   52.1. Personal Property (Code J/DPM Baggage).
       52.1.1. General. Code J/ DPM baggage is unaccompanied baggage moved as TP-2
       cargo. Code J baggage may be offered to the port as loose cargo requiring palletization
       for onward movement or may be palletized by contract port agents and offered as
       originating cargo. DPM baggage will be offered to the port as loose requiring
       palletization for onward movement. Pure Code J pallets contain shipments handled by a
       single port agent at the APOD; no additional cargo should be added to these pallets.
       Mixed Code J pallets contain shipments handled by multiple port agents at the APOD.
       Maintain personal property shipment integrity when possible.
       52.1.2. Aerial ports that do not generate enough Code J shipments may mix Code J and
       general cargo on port-built pallets.
       52.1.3. General cargo and Code J will be separated by using plastic covers or a suitable
       substitute inserted between shipments.      The DD Form 2775, Pallet Identifier,
       miscellaneous information section, will be annotated with remarks stating the pallet is
       mixed with Code J and general cargo. In no instance will Code J and hazardous cargo be
       mixed. Note: Aerial port personnel will strive to build Pure Code J pallets, whenever
       possible.
       52.1.4. Shipment Interruptions. HQ AMC/A4T/A4TC, in coordination with 618
       AOC/XOG, will advise the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) of
       possible interruptions in Code J baggage movements and post the applicable SDDC
       Customer Advisories. Interruptions include, but are not limited to, contingency/relief
       efforts, higher priority requirements, and excessive cargo generation. The advisory will
       include the expected length of delay and recommended options for alternate movement.
70                                                  AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


     Upon resolution of the interruption, HQ AMC/A4T/A4TC will retract the advisory
     notice.
     52.1.5. Shipment Upgrade. If Code J baggage is held in the port for 5 days due to
     inadequate airlift, the ACA/CSB/air freight officer/superintendent or equivalent, will
     upgrade the priority of the baggage from TP-2 to TP-1 IAW Section C, paragraph 17, of
     this volume. Although physical upgrade is not required, the responsible authority will
     upgrade the shipment’s priority within the port's automated system to allow proper load
     selection by load planning personnel.
  52.2. Code T/Household Goods. Code T shipments (airlift of household goods) are
  advanced from the Defense Personal Property System (DPS) to the Financial Air Clearance
  Transportation System (FACTS) as TP-2 cargo. Every effort should be made to maintain
  shipment integrity.
     52.2.1. When the Personal Property Shipping Offices (PPSO) have pre-coordinated
     approval with the AMC APOE, they may offer a specific allocation of Code T/Household
     Goods as TP-4 cargo for opportune movement, and should advise their Service ACA to
     ensure applicable transportation priority is applied. (Review paragraph 5.4 and
     accompanying Note for TP-4 restrictions/policy.)
     52.2.2. Household goods shipped to hard-lift areas will always be moved as TP-2 cargo.
     Hard-lift areas for household goods are identified in the AF Supplement to the JFTR,
     Attachment 6.
     52.2.3. When Household Goods shipments are for civilian employees and the 20-day
     window for TP-4 shipments has elapsed, contact the servicing JPPSO for status of
     shipments and onward movement determination IAW JTR provisions.
  52.3. Ports must ensure proper customs documentation is received for and accompanies each
  personal property shipment to final destination. Some overseas countries require unique
  customs documentation. Contact your local ACA/CSB or TMO for specific requirements.
  52.4. Cargo processing will ensure fiberboard boxes/crates (including code J/T) built on
  463L pallets are elevated (i.e., wooden skids) off the pallet surface to ensure items remain
  dry. PPTY shipments will have two serviceable plastic pallet covers secured under the net-
  set. When possible, personal property will be stored indoors and protected from inclement
  weather. When stored outdoors or transported during inclement weather, an additional dry
  and serviceable pallet cover (third) will be secured over the net-set.
  52.5. Traffic management offices will request tarping service when ordering trucks for
  PPTY transport. In addition, a change to the international solicitation has been coordinated
  with SDDC to clarify the requirement for TSP’s to place two serviceable plastic covers over
  PPTY shipments secured under the net-set. In addition, TSP’s are required to elevate
  fiberboard boxes from the surface of the 463L pallet, to reduce the possibility of water
  seeping into the shipment.
  52.6. Overseas ports must ensure a DD Form 1252/1252-1, U.S. Customs Declaration for
  Personal Property Shipments, is received for each personal property shipment terminating in
  the Customs Territory of the United States (CTUS) IAW DTR, Part V.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 71


   52.7. For international CBL/GBL shipments (Code T/Code J) ensure the name of the carrier
   and CBL/GBL number are marked on household goods (HHG) containers and loose Code J
   shipments. For pure Code J pallets, pre-built by carriers, ensure the name of the carrier and
   CBL/GBL number are clearly identified on the pallet.
53. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Material.
   53.1. FMS material moves through the airlift system in three modes: AMC TWCF channel
   traffic, AMC SAAM and pilot pickup by country-owned or controlled aircraft. FMS material
   shipped as channel traffic is given the same considerations and handled the same as all other
   channel traffic. Therefore, no specific instructions for FMS channel traffic are included in
   this volume. This volume provides guidance and procedures to be used by air terminal and
   CRW personnel in handling FMS shipments moved by AMC SAAM and country-owned or -
   controlled aircraft.
      53.1.1. Publications. The following publications apply to the movement of FMS
      material. DTR 4500.9-R, Part II, DOD 5105.38M, Security Assistance Management
      Manual, and AFMAN 16-101, International Affairs and Security Assistance Management
   53.2. Marking and Labeling. FMS material shipments are marked and labeled IAW
   MILSTD 129P, or as specified in the sales order (FMS case). Besides the requirements of
   MILSTD-129P, FMS marking also includes:
      53.2.1. The freight forwarder's address and the customer's in-country address. When DD
      Form 1387 is used, the "TO" block shows the freight forwarder address. The
      "ULTIMATE CONSIGNEE" block shows the overseas address.
      53.2.2. The FMS case number is normally found in the last line of the overseas address.
      If it is not in this position, it will be in the last line of the freight forwarder address.
   53.3. Packaging. FMS material is given the same protective handling that is given to DOD
   material. All appropriate packaging and handling publications apply. Packaging and
   handling of hazardous material must conform IAW AFMAN 24-204_IP, CFR 49, ICAO,
   IATA regulations or be packaged IAW approval from the foreign government’s Competent
   Authority.
   53.4. Compatibility. Hazardous material compatibility on foreign-owned or-controlled
   aircraft will be IAW AFMAN 16-101.
      53.4.1. Hazardous material scheduled for movement aboard foreign-owned or -
      controlled aircraft must be packaged, marked, labeled, and certified according to Title 49
      CFR, IATA, and ICAO regulations. Commercial air carriers must obtain the required
      exemptions by Title 49 CFR.
      53.4.2. Non-compatible hazardous material cannot be shipped by commercial carrier
      without approval from the Department of Transportation.
      53.4.3. Non-compatible hazardous material may be shipped by foreign military aircraft
      provided approval to ship non-compatibles is obtained from the foreign government
      when approved IAW AFMAN 16-101.
   53.5. Shipments Requiring Diplomatic Clearance. See AMCI 24-101, Vol. 9, for processing
   instructions for FMS cargo requiring diplomatic clearance prior to shipment.

  53.6. Manifest Procedures:
     53.6.1. SAAM. Prepare and distribute manifests IAW this volume.
     53.6.2. Pilot Pickup by Country-Owned or-Controlled Aircraft. Prepare a non-TWCF
     manifest with as much data as possible, e.g., aircraft type and number, TCN, pieces,
     weight, cube, destination, etc.
  53.7. In-transit Data Reporting. FMS shipments moving outside the Defense Transportation
  System (DTS) are excluded from in-transit data reporting.
  53.8. Requests for Information. Refer questions received from customer representatives,
  other than routine questions relating to in-being operations, as follows:
     53.8.1. SAAM Pricing - refer to the AOC/XOOOS.
     53.8.2. Cargo Terminal Charges (Loading and Unloading) - refer to HQ AMC/FM.
     53.8.3. 463L Pallet/Net Leasing Charges - refer to AMCI 24-201.
  53.9. Responsibilities of the Customer Representative. When a country has negotiated an
  FMS program with the US Government, it is liable for transporting the FMS material from
  the CONUS to destination. Sometimes this responsibility is handled by the country's staff,
  but if the staff is not able to do all the required work, they will hire an international freight
  forwarder to handle the material. The customer representative/freight forwarder is
  responsible for re-packaging, re-crating, or reinforcing inadequate containers. The U.S.
  Government has no jurisdiction or responsibility for doing this work. The only exception is
  containers damaged by AMC will be repaired by AMC.
  53.10. Direct Commercial Sales (DCS). DCS must be distinguished from the Foreign
  Military Sales (FMS) program, which manages government-to-government sales. DCS, a
  transaction between a foreign government and a U.S. commercial vender, is not authorized
  to use aerial port services unless there is a compelling need and authorization has been
  granted by a MAJCOM-level DOD sponsor. In some cases, foreign governments who have
  an existing Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) with the U.S., can apply for
  support under the ACSA and if approved the HQ AMC A4T/A4R will pre coordinate the
  terms and conditions of handling prior to movement. When DCS requests are received,
  confirm that the movement is not part of the FMS program and refer questions back to
  AMC/A4TC.
54. USTRANSCOM Defense Couriers.
  54.1. General. The United States Transportation Command establishes, maintains and
  operates a worldwide network of stations and couriers for the secure, timely and efficient
  distribution of classified and sensitive material for the US Government and its allies.
  Operational control and synchronization of global courier activities is exercised through
  USTRANSCOM's Defense Courier Division (TCJ3-C). Any compromise of material
  entrusted to a defense courier may cause exceptionally grave damage to national security.
  Therefore, the primary objective of all courier activities is to prevent unauthorized access to
  materials in courier custody. Defense couriers do not generate or own the materials they
  control but for the purposes of this instruction, articles in defense courier custody will be
  referred to as courier material.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               73


  54.2. Courier material processing. TCJ3-C couriers have GATES accounts with Defense
  Courier permissions giving them the ability to receive, process, store and manifest courier
  materials. Bays 18 and 19 have been designated to provide aerial port load planners and cape
  forecasters visibility over outbound courier material when it is travelling via AMC airlift
  channel. Couriers will move outbound cargo into the designated bays according to locally
  coordinated procedures and the aerial port sequence of events. Load planners will then be
  able to select courier materials for manifesting.
     54.2.1. Courier material air manifested to an aerial port where no permanent defense
     courier activity exists will be trucked out by the special handling functional area
     according to locally coordinated procedures between TCJ3-C couriers and the aerial port
     function. At no time will the aerial port function physically take possession of or deliver
     courier material to a consignee.
     54.2.2. All TCJ3-C courier material moved via the DTS will use TAC code 0003 in
     accordance with DTR, Part II. Other courier elements not assigned to USTRANSCOM
     but moving material via the DTS will use different TAC codes. Only TCJ3-C assigned
     couriers are authorized to use the 0003 TAC.
  54.3. Movement of courier material by AMC airlift channel. DCS will coordinate all
  outbound movements on AMC owned or controlled airlift channels with TACC/XOG
  (bookies). Space blocks on both AMC organic and contract airlift must be requested NLT 48
  hours prior to the required movement date. TACC/XOG will in turn task the capability
  forecasting and/or load planning function at the applicable aerial port. The capability
  forecasting/load planning function will coordinate applicable space blocks with the aerial
  port functional areas.
     54.3.1. Courier station personnel should coordinate with the local Capability
     Forecasting/Load Planning section NLT 24 hours prior to aircraft departure.
     54.3.2. TCJ3-C couriers escorting material moving within the DTS are authorized to
     travel on aircraft transporting hazardous cargo identified as P3/P4 in Attachment A4-1 of
     AFMAN 24-204_IP and on contracted aircraft IAW CFR, Title 14, Aeronautics and
     Space, Subpart T—Flight Operations, Part 121.583 (7).
     54.3.3. Courier material may be consolidated in several forms including wooden crates
     or skids, large/small cardboard boxes and canvas pouches. Shipments may be loose
     loaded or palletized. Generally, couriers will prepare their own pallets for movement
     within the DTS. Courier stations may request pallet build up instruction from the local
     aerial port.
  54.4. Courier Material Handling Guidance. Loading and unloading of cargo pallets,
  including pallets containing courier material, on DTS aircraft is the air terminal's
  responsibility. Only TCJ3-C assigned couriers are authorized to handle individual shipments
  of courier material.
     54.4.1. TCJ3-C couriers escort materials from origin to destination and must not be
     separated from the cargo. Since couriers maintain direct control/surveillance over courier
     materials, a DD Form 1387-2 is not required.
 74                                                     AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


       54.4.2. Courier material will be moved as expeditiously as possible IAW airlift priorities
       and space allocations. Couriers are authorized to use expedited shipment handling
       procedures IAW AMCI 24-101, Vol. 6.
       54.4.3. Courier material must not be loaded or stored on a pallet with hazardous
       materials.
55. Cooperative Airlift Agreement (CAA) Cargo.
   55.1. General. The Governments of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and New
   Zealand have entered into agreements with the United States that provide for the reciprocal
   transportation of cargo. These agreements provide for the transportation of cargo of the
   military forces of these countries on aircraft operated by the military forces of the United
   States and for transportation of US military forces cargo on aircraft operated by their military
   forces.
   55.2. All exchange traffic transported under these agreements is on a reimbursable basis.
   The rate of reimbursement is at the rate charged to the military forces of the United States for
   airlift in the DTS. Imbalances in the exchange of airlift are computed and paid for by the
   appropriate finance centers.
   55.3. The responsibility of the nation supplying airlift is limited to providing airlift from the
   onload air terminal to the offload air terminal. The requesting nation is responsible for
   delivery of cargo to the onload air terminal and for transportation of cargo from the offload
   air terminal to the ultimate destination. The operation and maintenance of the loading and
   unloading equipment is the responsibility of the owning nation.
   55.4. 618 AOC/XOG is responsible for coordinating the movement of CAA cargo with the
   foreign activity. Refer requests received from other activities to 618 AOC/XOG for action.
   The AOC can only honor requests from official CAA validators of the country concerned.
   Therefore, instruct requesters to route requests to their CAA validator for submission to the
   AOC. Except for TCN construction, which 618 AOC/XOG is responsible for, all
   documentation will be IAW DTR procedures. Construct CAA TCNs IAW Table 4

   55.5. CAA cargo will not be entered into the airlift system until authority for movement and
   a valid TCN constructed as above are received from the AOC. Listing CAA cargo on the
   same TWCF manifest as other TWCF cargo shipments is authorized.
56. RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE.
57. Route Support. Manifesting and reporting IAW AMCI 24-101, Vol. 6, Transportation
Documentation, Data, Records, and Reports, are required when positioning or redistributing
route support equipment (stanchions, litters, seats, Air Transportable Galley/Lavatories, K-
loaders, power carts, etc.). All assets will be manifested and moved as FSS cargo, IAW AMCI
23-102. Enter “196” in the Project Code (record positions 57-59) of the TCMD and in the
“Project Code” block of the DD Form 1387, MSL, to indicate the shipments are FSS. These
shipments may be entered into the AMC channel airlift system without the submission of an
ATCMD to the ACA for airlift clearance. Aircraft assets which are installed components or in
direct support of the aircraft which is being operated are not required to be manifested nor
governed by AFMAN 24-204_IP or DTR, since items are not entered into the DTS as cargo.
58. Air Transportability Testing and Loading Agency (ATTLA) Certification.
   58.1. This section provides clarification to cargo processors, joint inspectors and load
   planners when determining if cargo requires an ATTLA Certification. The next paragraph
   provides flags for determining if an ATTLA Certification letter may be required. The last
   section will provide more specific guidance to joint inspectors/load planners when making
   the actual determination on the need for an ATTLA Certification.
   58.2. For cargo requiring ATTLA Certification, it is the shipper’s responsibility to obtain
   and provide the most current ATTLA Certification letters during cargo receipt, and the aerial
   port representative’s responsibility to confirm the certification is provided and current to
   include modifications. When determining if a certification may be required, cargo
   processing and/or special handling agents will use the following criteria as a flag on when to
   notify load planning. Load planning will utilize paragraph 58.3 of this section to determine if
   an ATTLA Certification letter is required.
       58.2.1. Length: Greater than 20 ft. (commonly palletized outsized cargo such as pipes,
       wood, helo blades, light oversized cargo, etc. does not require ATTLA Certification)
       58.2.2. Height or Width: Greater than 8 ft.
       58.2.3. Weight: Greater than 10,000 lbs.
       58.2.4. Floor contact pressure: Greater than 50 psi
       58.2.5. Axle loads: Greater than 5,000 lbs.
       58.2.6. Wheel Loads: Greater than 2,500 lbs.
       58.2.7. Any item which requires special equipment or procedures for loading and/or
       securing for flight.
       58.2.8. Unfamiliar items designed to be loaded directly into the aircraft rail system.
       58.2.9. Cargo that exceeds weight limits stated in the cert letter.
   58.3. If the cargo exceeds the criteria listed in paragraph 58.2 of this section and load
   planners/joint inspectors have confirmed an ATTLA Certification letter is not listed on the
76                                                   AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


  ATTLA website, then the load planner/joint inspector will utilize the following criteria to
  make the determination if an ATTLA Certification letter is required.
     58.3.1. Items that exceed the allowable loading limits of the aircraft as described in the
     applicable aircraft TO 1C-XXX-9 (Dash –9).
     58.3.2. Items that require special equipment or loading procedures not listed in the
     applicable aircraft’s Dash -9.
     58.3.3. Items designed to interface with the aircraft rail systems (i.e., LSA Adapters) not
     contained in the applicable aircraft’s Dash -9.
     58.3.4. Any type of watercraft/fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft not identified in the
     applicable aircraft’s Dash -9.
     58.3.5. Enclosed items (airtight containers, on-board tanks, etc.) not designed with
     pressure relief devices or items that cannot be configured in a way to allow for aircraft
     cabin pressure changes.
     58.3.6. Non-palletized items with questionable structural integrity or items with
     significant damage to the frame or structural components (i.e., Battle damaged
     equipment).
     58.3.7. Items that cannot be restrained using standard restraint procedures listed in the
     aircraft’s Dash -9 or items requiring specific restraint procedures.
     58.3.8. Items that operate in flight.
  58.4. When load planners/joint inspectors make determinations on ATTLA Certification,
  they must also account for any planned transload at downline stations, (i.e., C-17 to C-130,
  etc.). If an ATTLA Certification letter is required at the trans-load station, load
  planners/joint inspectors will ensure that the ATTLA Certification letter accompanies the
  shipment.
  58.5. Load planners and joint inspectors must maintain an active account for
  viewing/verifying ATTLA Certification letters. The Air Transport CoP is located at the
  following                                                                         site:
  https://AFKM.WPAFB.AF.MIL/Community/Views/Home.aspx?Filter=OO-EN-KA-02
  58.6. If load planners/joint inspectors cannot determine that an item required an ATTLA
  Certification letter, contact ATTLA.
     58.6.1. ATTLA’s contact information: Email: ATTLA@WPAFB.AF.MIL or DSN:
     785-2330, Comm: (937) 255-2330
  58.7. The aircraft loadmaster has final determination on accepting the cargo for air
  movement.
  58.8. Please direct questions to A4TC (Air Cargo Policy), AMC.A4TCP@SCOTT.AF.MIL,
  DSN: 779-4434.
59. DENTON Program

Section H—. - Irregularities in Shipment Processing

60. General. The following procedures provide guidance for handling cargo/mail shipment
irregularities within the AMC transportation system. Follow these procedures to trace missing
shipments, document lost shipments and expedite the movement of cargo/mail within the AMC
system. Initiate and answer correspondence concerning irregularities within time frames, if
specified, as outlined in the following paragraphs.
61. Originating Shipments with Irregularities.
   61.1. General. Reconcile any discrepancies noted at time of in-checking cargo/mail with the
   ACA/CSB or appropriate authority shipping activity prior to acceptance into the AMC airlift
   system. Prepare and distribute appropriate discrepancy reports IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter
   210.
       61.1.1. Ensure the ACA/CSB prepares discrepancy reports on shipments arriving by an
       intermediate carrier, e.g., commercial truck. Shipments corrected by the shipper do not
       require these reports. Note: Shipments from intermediate carriers will not be refused.
       61.1.2. Prepare SF 364, Report of Discrepancy, for shipments entered into the airlift
       system that are improperly packed, marked, labeled, or certified, IAW the DTR, Part II,
       Chapter 210.
       61.1.3. If the shipper cannot make the required corrections, the aerial port
       recoupment/repacking section may assist with the corrective actions within the aerial
       port’s capability.
       61.1.4. The CSB is responsible for the preparation of SF 364 on shipment frustrations
       that result in a delay or additional packaging costs at CONUS air terminals.
       61.1.5. AMC aerial port air freight offices outside of CONUS are responsible for the
       preparation and distribution of all SFs 364 prepared on shipments transiting the aerial
       ports.
   61.2. Mis-directed shipments. These are shipments received at aerial ports for movement
   over routes that are neither originating nor connecting to channels (IAW the AMC Channel
   Sequence Listing) out of the port where the shipments were delivered.
       61.2.1. When mis-directed cargo arrives at an aerial port, it will be frustrated to the
       ACA/CSB IAW paragraph 65, this volume, for correction.
       61.2.2. The ACA/CSB will monitor mis-directed shipments and redirect accordingly.
       Aerial port personnel will identify errors and mis-directed shipments that may slip
       through the system to the ACA/CSB for corrective action.
 78                                                   AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


      61.2.3. When opportune airlift exists, use it to forward mis-directed shipments to the
      correct APOE for onward movement. When manifesting these shipments on opportune
      airlift, add a TXI trailer record identifying the shipment as being mis-directed.
62. Documentation Irregularities for Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)
Billing.
   62.1. General. All shipments must be properly documented for the TWCF billing process to
   occur. When shipments are incorrectly assigned, mis-routed, diverted or require additional
   transportation to reach destination, they must be properly documented. When the shipper
   causes an irregularity, the shipment must be terminated and turned over to the
   ACA/CSB/AMT for new documentation. The new documentation must show the new
   APOE for correct TWCF billing to occur.
   62.2. Procedures.
      62.2.1. When an originating shipment enters the airlift system at a station other than that
      reflected on the TCMD, the documentation must be changed to indicate the correct
      APOE. This change in documentation is necessary to ensure shippers are billed
      correctly. At the point the shipment enters the AMC airlift system, the APOE and
      manifesting stations must match in order for AMC to bill the customer. Shipments
      arriving at an APOD that require further airlift by AMC to reach the ultimate consignee
      must be re-documented for billing to occur. For example:
          62.2.1.1. A shipment moving from Dover AFB (DOV) to Incirlik AB (ADA) arrives
          at ADA. The ACA determines the shipment is for Ankara (ESB). This shipment
          would be terminated at ADA and re-consigned with the documentation showing ADA
          as the new APOE and ESB as the APOD.
      62.2.2. In-transit stations will not change the APOE for shipments that have reached the
      APOD. When an in-transit station changes the APOE, a double billing will occur. For
      example:
          62.2.2.1. A shipment moving from Travis AFB (SUU) to Ramstein AB (RMS) is
          shipped to Dover AFB (DOV) for transshipment. A billing occurs from SUU to RMS
          when SUU manifests the shipment to DOV. If DOV changes the APOE to indicate
          "DOV" and manifests the shipment, another billing will occur from DOV to RMS.
      62.2.3. When the irregularity is caused by an error on the part of an air terminal, the
      documentation is changed to reflect the correct information (if necessary) and sent to
      destination as an in-transit shipment.
63. Aircraft Loads Arriving Without Manifests.
   63.1. Procedures. When an aircraft load arrives without cargo/mail manifests, take the
   following steps:
      63.1.1. Stations with GATES capabilities will retrieve a copy of the manifest from
      mission monitoring or check manifest drop down box.
   63.2. Stations without GATES capabilities will conduct a thorough search of the aircraft to
   verify non-receipt of the manifest.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 79


      63.2.1. Stations may use an electronic transfer from previous stations to prepare a
      manifest or offloading processing list/in-check list for processing of shipments.
      63.2.2. ATOC will contact the manifesting station by telephone or electronic transfers to
      obtain necessary manifest header information and request appropriate manifests be sent,
      and annotate contact in remarks section of AMC Form 77.
      63.2.3. Air terminal representatives will visually inspect all cargo shipments for anything
      that requires immediate action and prepare a substitute manifest (DD Form 1385) for
      these items to facilitate processing. When documents are missing, prepare a substitute
      TCMD/manifest to allow delivery pending receipt of the missing documents. Hold the
      remainder of the load intact, awaiting the arrival of the manifest. If, after 12 hours, the
      manifest has not been received, break each pallet down and take appropriate information
      from the shipping labels. If comparison discloses a shortage, initiate tracer action.
      Process the shipments as over shipments. When missing documents are received, retain
      one copy and deliver the remainder to the consigned activity for comparison with the
      substitute manifest.
64. Bumped Pallet and Shipment Processing.
   64.1. General. This is any pallet or shipment of cargo/mail which is planned and manifested
   (pre or final) for movement, but is removed from the manifest and returned to the port
   inventory.
   64.2. Procedures. Handle bumped cargo IAW AMC 24-101, Vol. 9, paragraph 7.18.
65. Frustrated Shipments.
   65.1. General. Frustrated shipments of cargo/mail are those that, due to some irregularity or
   request of the shipper, cannot be accepted into, or continue movement in, the airlift system.
   Attachment 9 lists frustration reason codes.
   65.2. Procedures.
      65.2.1. General cargo (includes non-hazardous materials requiring special handling).
          65.2.1.1. Store frustrated cargo in secure holding area(s) based on the Risk Category
          Code (Attachment 9).
          65.2.1.2. Complete AMC Form 33 and distribute as follows:
              65.2.1.2.1. Original: Attach to the number one container of the shipment.
              65.2.1.2.2. Duplicate: The section preparing the AMC Form 33 will ensure status
              of shipment is properly documented, and file duplicate copy in originator's file.
              65.2.1.2.3. Triplicate: Furnish to ACA/CSB/appropriate authority for necessary
              action. Note: An AMC Form 33 is not required if correction(s) is made at the
              time of cargo in-check and no action is needed by ACA/CSB.
      65.2.2. Cargo frustrated in GATES and placed in a designated frustrated cargo bay
      location will not require a printed AMC Form 33. Any frustrated cargo that is placed in
      the same location as processed cargo (e.g., signature service or outsized cargo too large to
      place in designated location) will still require an AMC Form 33 attached to the piece for
      identification purposes.
80                                                   AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


        65.2.2.1. Cargo processors must ensure detailed information for frustrated cargo is
        captured in the remarks section of GATES. It is imperative that as much information
        as possible be entered in the remarks section in order for the ACA or CSB to expedite
        corrective actions. The cargo processor must also ensure the proper frustration code
        is assigned and utilized in GATES.
        65.2.2.2. Aerial port leadership will ensure that all cargo placed in a designated
        frustrated bay location is managed utilizing the GATES frustrated cargo report.
        65.2.2.3. If cargo arrives at the aerial port with discrepancies and cannot be input into
        GATES due to lack of information (e.g., no TCN), a manual AMC Form 33 will be
        utilized.
        65.2.2.4. The AMC Form 33 will still be utilized for cargo placed in designated
        frustrated bay location at non-GATES locations and in instances when there is no
        GATES connectivity (manual procedures).
        65.2.2.5. Procedures for the AMC Form 1015 will not be affected. It must still be
        utilized for cargo requiring hazardous material certification.
     65.2.3. ACA/CSB or appropriate authority will ensure all deficiencies indicated on the
     AMC Form 33 are corrected. ACA/CSB or appropriate authority will sign the original
     copy of the AMC Form 33 to certify corrective actions were taken and will notify the
     appropriate terminal representative that the cargo is ready to enter/continue in the airlift
     system. The ACA/CSB or appropriate authority is responsible for updating the computer
     status. The terminal representative will verify the corrective actions and process the
     cargo.
     65.2.4. After all discrepancies are corrected, file the original copy of the AMC Form 33
     in the work center that originated the report and make disposition IAW AF Records

     65.2.5. GATES Procedures for Frustrated Cargo.
        65.2.5.1. Strict compliance with the following policy is required to ensure uniform
        and reliable frustrated cargo data from all ports is accessible through GATES. This
        guidance encompasses two scenarios: Shipments arriving with a valid TCN and
        shipments without a TCN.
        65.2.5.2. Shipments arriving with a valid TCN: If a shipment arrives at the port with
        a valid TCN and there is a discrepancy, immediately frustrate the shipment at time of
        in-check into GATES using the appropriate frustration reason (FR) code (see
        Attachment 9). Annotate the specific reason for the frustration in the remarks area of
        GATES. Note: Service HQ/ DLA will use the reason/remarks to request that
        shippers correct future shipments. Therefore, it is imperative for the remarks to be
        very specific.
        65.2.5.3. Immediate GATES frustration data input is critical to capture accurate total
        frustration time.
        65.2.5.4. Shipments arriving without a TCN: Annotate these shipments in the
        Problem Shipment Log that can be accessed through the Shipment Unit Maintenance
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                81


          Area of GATES. Fill in as many data entry fields as possible and annotate the
          remarks area with detailed information pertaining to the shipment. Note: Service
          HQ/DLA will use the reason/remarks to request that shippers correct future
          shipments. Therefore, it is imperative for the remarks to be very specific.
          65.2.5.5. At a minimum the following specific fields are required to correctly
          identify the shipper and discrepancies associated with the shipment: consignor,
          consignee, shipper, description/specific problem related to the shipment.
          65.2.5.6. Before closing the shipment problem log ensure all annotations are
          shipment specific.
          65.2.5.7. For frustrated cargo shipments with documentation errors in which
          consignors/consignees cannot be located, e.g., DVD cargo, contact the responsible
          party for disposition in Table 5. First, ensure the discrepancies cannot be corrected
          within 60 days and the ports have exhausted all “good faith” efforts to locate the
          owners. These 60 days allows time for customers who have not received the cargo to
          try and locate their cargo. If no inquiries are received within 60 days of the time the
          “good faith” search has closed, then turn the cargo over IAW with Table 5.,
          Disposition of Frustrated Cargo After 60 days.

      65.2.6. HAZMAT Procedures.
          65.2.6.1. Use the AMC Form 1015 to identify incorrectly packaged, prepared, or
          documented hazardous material shipments. Provide the form identifying the
          discrepancy to the office/agency responsible for corrective actions, i.e., ACA or CSB.
 82                                                    AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


          65.2.6.2. The individual performing the corrective action will check the appropriate
          block on the form and sign and date it (comply with paragraph 45 when repackaging
          is required). Return the form to the inspection activity.
          65.2.6.3. The inspection activity will check the discrepancies to ensure corrective
          action. The individual performing the re-inspection will check the “Reinspected By”
          block and sign and date the form. Forward the completed form with the Shipper’s
          Declaration for Dangerous Goods to the Load Planning section. The “Inspector” may
          sign the “Inspected By……”, “Corrected By…..”, and “Reinspected By…..” when a
          correction is made to only Key 19 of the Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
          Completion of a discrepancy report IAW paragraph 65 is required.
          65.2.6.4. A “True Copy” of the Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods may be
          prepared by the terminal or ACA/CSBIAW AFMAN 24-204_IP, Attachment 17,
          from a original copy provided by the shipper.
          65.2.6.5. When an improperly prepared or documented shipment is returned directly
          to the shipper, the aerial port/terminal will maintain the original form until the shipper
          takes corrective action. Check the “Corrected By” block and enter “Shipper
          Corrected” when items are re-inspected and are acceptable for air shipment. The
          individual performing the re-inspection will check the “Reinspected By” block and
          sign and date the form. Forward the completed form with the Shipper’s Declaration
          for Dangerous Goods to the Load Planning section.
      65.2.7. The shipper is ultimately responsible for correcting the discrepancies.
66. Short Shipments.
   66.1. General. Manifested air shipments of cargo or mail not located upon air cargo in-
   checking will be considered short shipped cargo. Detailed guidance for short shipment
   reporting and reconciliation is outlined in AMCI 24-101, Vol. 6.
   66.2. Procedures. Check all cargo/mail shipments arriving at the terminal against the
   accompanying documents for accountability. Take the following actions if a shipment is not
   located in whole or in part during cargo/mail in-check.
      66.2.1. Circle the missing shipment line item on the manifest, offload-processing list,
      and in-check list. Hand scribe "S/S" on the right hand margin of the manifest/offload
      processing list/in-check list immediately following the circled line item and update
      computer records by entering "S/S" in the status field.
          66.2.1.1. When reconciling terminating cargo and mail at GATES locations, circling
          the short shipments and hand scribing “S/S” on the terminating manifest does not
          apply. To account for short shipments, a GATES generated manifest amendment
          sheet will be printed out and attached to the front of the terminating manifest.
      66.2.2. Change the totals on the manifest to reflect totals actually received.           This
      includes the manifest and pallet headers, if applicable.
      66.2.3. Forward manifest/offload processing list in-check lists to the appropriate section
      for initiation of short shipment reporting.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  83


67. Over-shipments.
   67.1. General. Un-manifested air shipments of cargo/mail arriving at an AMC air terminal
   are considered over-shipped.       Detailed guidance for over shipment reporting and
   reconciliation is outlined in AMCI 24-101, Vol. 6.
   67.2. Procedures. Check all cargo and mail shipments arriving at the terminal against the
   accompanying documents for accountability. Take the following actions on shipments
   received, but not listed on the air manifest:
      67.2.1. Add the shipment to the appropriate manifest offload processing/in-check list on
      the last page below the cargo totals, i.e., total pieces, weight and cube. Use additional
      paper if necessary and attach to original manifest offload processing/in-check lists. Hand
      scribe "O/S" in the right hand margin of the document used for checking immediately
      following the handwritten entry. Take care to assure the information transcribed from the
      DD Form 1387 to the manifest offload processing/in-check list is the same. Ensure data
      from offload processing/in-check list is legibly transcribed to the manifest.
          67.2.1.1. When reconciling terminating cargo and mail at GATES locations, hand
          scribing overshipped TCN data and the words O/S on the terminating manifest does
          not apply. To account for over shipments, a GATES generated manifest amendment
          sheet will be printed out and attached to the front of the terminating manifest.
      67.2.2. If no manifest accompanies the shipment, prepare an inbound substitute manifest
      (DD Form 1385) indicating the station originating the shipment as the manifesting
      station. In the event the shipment has obviously been transferred at an enroute station,
      indicate that station as the manifesting station. Annotate this manifest with all
      information contained on the DD Form 1387, and annotate GMT hour and date code of
      aircraft arrival in the upper right-hand corner. Annotate the manifest with the words
      "over shipment."
      67.2.3. Update computer records when in-checking over-shipments by entering all
      information about the shipment, i.e., TCN, pieces, weight, cube and consignee/consignor.
      67.2.4. Adjust or calculate totals listed on the manifest offload processing/in-check list to
      reflect totals actually received. This includes the manifest and pallet headers, if
      applicable.
      67.2.5. Forward manifest/offload processing list in-check lists to the appropriate section
      for initiation of over shipment reporting.
          67.2.5.1. When utilizing GATES, reconciled totals will be placed on the manifest
          amendment sheet. Any over/short shipment information that is not reflected on the
          amendment sheet must be added to the amendment sheet. Reconciling totals will be
          accomplished by calculating the totals on the terminating manifest with the over/short
          shipment TCN’s listed on the manifest amendment sheet.
68. Pilfered Shipments.
   68.1. General. When a shipment arrives at a station and its condition indicates possible
   pilferage (e.g., cases broken open, mail sacks torn or cut, etc.), the ATOC Duty
   Officer/Senior Controller will initiate an immediate investigation to determine if pilferage
   has indeed occurred.
 84                                                   AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


   68.2. Procedures. If pilferage is suspected or confirmed:
       68.2.1. Make an immediate report, by telephone, to Security Force (civilian equivalent),
       followed by a written report in the format indicated in Figure 4 within 24 hours.
       68.2.2. Upon release of the shipment by the security force, the air freight
       officer/superintendent will coordinate with the ACA/CSB regarding disposition of
       pilfered shipments. If the Chief of Security Forces confiscates the shipment, follow the
       procedures in paragraph 69.

Figure 4. Report of Pilferage.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                85


69. Confiscated Shipments.
   69.1. General. A cargo/mail shipment within the DTS that is removed due to pilferage,
   suspicion of containing illegal items, etc., is considered to be a confiscated shipment.
   69.2. Procedures. When a cargo/mail shipment is confiscated, the air terminal obtains a
   receipt from the confiscating agency on a TCMD or appropriate transportation release
   document as if the shipment were terminating. Annotate the document with the reason the
   shipment was removed from the DTS.
       69.2.1. Advise the consignor, consignee, and HQ AMC/A4TC that the shipment has
       been confiscated. Make notification by e-mail, fax, or priority message.
       69.2.2. If the shipment is released by the confiscating agency within 15 days, then:
          69.2.2.1. Originating Stations. Process as an originating shipment and notify the
          consignor, consignee, and HQ AMC/A4TC that the shipment has been released for
          onward movement to destination.
          69.2.2.2. Enroute Stations. Document and process the shipment as an in-transit
          shipment and notify the consignor, consignee, and HQ AMC/A4TC that the shipment
          has been released for airlift to destination.
       69.2.3. If the shipment is not released from the confiscating agency within 15 days, the
       air terminal representative where the confiscating action took place initiates an DD Form
       361 to advise the consignor and consignee of the confiscated status so action may be
       taken. In addition, notify HQ AMC/A4TC of action taken.
70. Lost Shipments.
   70.1. General. If tracer action, which includes a message to the consignee requesting
   acknowledgment of receipt or non-receipt of cargo, fails to locate a shipment in the AMC
   airlift system within 15 workdays, it is considered to be a lost shipment.
   70.2. Procedures. The station originating the tracer initiates a DD Form 361 regardless of
   dollar value and it is distributed IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter 210. In addition to the
   statement: “Shipment could not be located in the AMC airlift system and has been declared
   lost.” include a statement in the remarks block that the consignee confirms that shipment was
   not received.
71. Shipments that are in-checked, but not located in the terminal.
   71.1. Procedures for “can’t locate” shipments.
       71.1.1. After Cargo Processing/Aircraft Services section perform a thorough physical
       inventory of the terminal complex, and “Track and Trace” in GATES, they will inform
       Data Records of the suspected loss. Data Records will complete the following actions:
          71.1.1.1. Initiate RFI Transportation Discrepancy Report (TDR) using DD Form 361
          filled out IAW DTR, Part II, Chapter 210 and send to the consignee, up line, and
          down line stations with the following statement in block 30: “Non-response within
          10 days from the consignee will be considered receipt of shipment.” If completed
          tracer action fails to locate the shipment within 10 days, consider the shipment lost.
          Note: The RFI and final TDR (Initial Notification) are both completed on the same
 86                                                  AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


          form in GFMs DIS; differentiate between the two by checking the appropriate box in
          Part I. Note: The DD Form 361 is used for both RFI and final TDR (Initial
          Notification); differentiate by checking the appropriate box in Part I.
   71.2. Delete shipments that cannot be located within the time frames cited in preceding
   paragraphs from the port management level with deletion reason code F. Deletion
   transactions must be approved in writing by the air freight officer/superintendent or their
   designated representative. Management must ensure deletion authorization is controlled at
   the supervisory level.
72. Found Shipments. Document shipments found in the AMC terminal as over shipments and
send on to the ultimate consignee.
73. Damaged Shipments.
   73.1. General. Inspect all cargo shipments for damage. Terminals will not accept
   originating shipments that appear to be damaged, except those received via intermediate
   carriers, e.g., commercial trucks. For all damaged shipments which are accepted, circle the
   line item on the manifest/shipping document, annotate degree of damage on reverse side of
   manifest/shipping document, and frustrate to ACA/CSB, or equivalent authority, pending
   corrective action or receipt of disposition instructions.
   73.2. Procedures. In the event a shipment has been damaged within the AMC airlift system,
   take the following appropriate action:
      73.2.1. When only the container is damaged, the operations officer arranges with the
      appropriate activity to have the shipment repacked, marked and labeled, as required.
      73.2.2. If inspection reveals the contents are slightly damaged and the shipment is a non-
      technical item, the air freight officer/superintendent (contract station manager)
      determines if the shipment should be sent to its destination. If it contains a technical
      item, frustrate it to the ACA/CSB or equivalent authority. The ACA/CSB or equivalent
      authority will have the contents inspected by a qualified individual to determine if the
      shipment should be sent in its present condition. In either case, initiate a DD Form
      361within 15 days explaining the cause of damage in the remarks section.
      73.2.3. If inspection reveals the contents are damaged beyond economical repair,
      frustrate the shipment to the ACA/CSB, or equivalent authority, and notify HQ
      AMC/A4TC. Annotate the reverse side of the station copy of the TCMD/manifest with
      details of the damage and the date/time HQ AMC/A4TC was notified. Initiate a DD
      Form 361 within 15 days advising the degree of damage and requesting disposition
      instructions from the shipper. Send an information copy of the DD Form 361 to
      ACA/CSB or equivalent authority.
      73.2.4. All DD Forms 361 pertaining to personal property shipments will include the
      member's name, grade and the shipment TCN.
      73.2.5. Prepare a SF Form 364, Report of Discrepancy, as applicable, when instances of
      unsatisfactory preservation, packaging, marking of shipments are encountered. Note: If
      an incident involves cargo damaged by AMC, prepare the TDR IAW applicable
      procedures, and shipper will route the claim through their local finance office.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                87


   73.3. Mail Shipments. Inspect all mail shipments for damage or unlabeled pouches at in-
   checking. If a shipment/pouch incurs damage or has illegible, loose or torn labels within the
   AMC airlift system, the individual in-checking the mail takes the following actions:
      73.3.1. Terminate military mail pouches identified as containing APO or FPO mail to the
      nearest AMT, US military or US Postal Service office designated to handle military mail.
      73.3.2. Civil International Mail.
          73.3.2.1. Terminate and deliver pouches identified as containing civil international
          mail originating outside the US, to a general post office (not Army or Air Force post
          office). This includes an international exchange office or other general post offices,
          as identified in regulations for the Universal Postal Union (UPU).
          73.3.2.2. Terminate and deliver pouches identified as containing civil international
          mail originating in the US to the nearest AMT or US military post office for re-
          pouching or re-labeling. If the local post office is not equipped to take the necessary
          action, deliver such mail to the nearest international postal exchange office.
      73.3.3. In all cases where pouches are terminated due to damage or labeling deficiencies,
      annotate the reverse side of the TCMD/manifest with details of the deficiency and final
      disposition. Transfer the pouches to the appropriate agency and obtain a recipient’s
      signature and printed name on the TCMD/manifest. Attach a signed copy to the inbound
      manifest for filing.
74. Diversion of Cargo/Mail.
   74.1. General. Do not divert channel cargo accepted into the airlift system and included in
   the terminal operating level to other modes of transportation without contacting 618
   AOC/XOG.
   74.2. Procedures:
      74.2.1. Release diverted channel cargo that no longer requires air transportation or
      redirect it to final destination as determined by ACA/CSB or equivalent authority.
      74.2.2. Transfer cargo cleared for diversion to the TMF or shipping activity. The
      TMF/shipping activity signs the TCMD/manifest or release listing for the diverted cargo.
      74.2.3. Mark and re-document shipments requiring diversion as appropriate. When
      notified that a shipment is to be diverted, release the shipment to the TMF or appropriate
      shipment activity. ACA/CSB or equivalent authority will send a TCMD indicating the
      diversion to the shipper and both the original or new consignee, as applicable. (For
      example: A shipment arrives at Rota, Spain, for the USS Enterprise, due to arrive there
      the following week. While the USS Enterprise is en route, it is diverted to Naples, Italy.
      The shipment now must be moved to Naples.)
          74.2.3.1. The APOD will receipt for the shipment when notified by the ACA activity
          prior to the shipment’s arrival or while the shipment is still in the air terminal. The
          ACA activity prepares a new TCMD and all appropriate documentation required for
          movement to the new APOD. Once the shipment is receipted, the air terminal
          updates the APOE to reflect their station and the new APOD destination (this is
          crucial to ensure correct billing occurs).
 88                                                     AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


           74.2.3.2. If the shipment returns NLT 72 hrs after being receipted for by the
           consignee, the ACA activity originates a new TCMD and other appropriate
           documentation required for onward movement to the new APOD. The air terminal
           aborts the original truck manifest and removes the shipment from the manifest. The
           manifest is departed again using the original departure time and date. Update the
           APOE of the removed shipment to its location and the APOD to the new location.
           74.2.3.3. If the shipment is returned to the air terminal after 72 hrs, the ACA activity
           or equivalent authority re-originates (i.e., new TCMD, new TCN or other appropriate
           documentation) the shipment for onward movement to the new APOD. The shipment
           is then processed, as originating, in the AMC system with the terminated APOD
           listed as the APOE on the new document.
       74.2.4. Cargo diversion policy above does not apply to the opportune movement of
       AMC channel cargo on non-TWCF aircraft. Manifest and report these shipments,
       including non-AMC channel offload points, as if moved on TWCF aircraft. When cargo
       is moved to non-AMC channel offload points, the following restrictions and procedures
       apply:
           74.2.4.1. Ensure the offload point is equipped to handle the offload.
           74.2.4.2. Transport the cargo to the offload point, or its close proximity.
           74.2.4.3. Ensure the movement does not violate border clearance requirements.
           74.2.4.4. The manifest header will reflect the non-AMC channel offload clear text
           destination, and all other entries, including the APOD fields, will reflect movement to
           the original AMC channel station.
           74.2.4.5. Determine an AMC mission identifier for manifesting and reporting
           purposes.
       74.2.5. If it is necessary to divert mail received at an APOE to another mode of
       transportation, coordinate the diversion with the AMT or US Postal Service activity.
       Accomplish the following documentation:
           74.2.5.1. Manifest and handle the shipment similar to mail moving on AMC aircraft.
           74.2.5.2. Annotate station documents with the words: “DIVERTED TO “(name of
           carrier, aircraft number, destination to which diverted, and date) and "DIVERSION
           COORDINATED WITH".

Section I—Load Planning

75. Air Terminal Load Planning. Load planning is responsible for planning, selecting,
sequencing, manifesting and monitoring each aircraft cargo/mail load. The load planning
process begins with the receipt of the setup schedule information. The load planning process is
typically performed 12 hours before aircraft departure; however, it must be completed NLT 6
hours prior to aircraft departure for AMC organic aircraft and by contractual agreement times for
contract carriers. A load plan will be generated for any AMC mission carrying cargo that is
handled by the Ramp Services section; however, a load plan is not required for loading of loose
cargo/mail up to 300 pounds total and requiring less than a pallet position of space. A revised
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   89


load plan is not required when an aircraft is downloaded and no other changes to the load are
made. Aircrew loadmasters/boom operators will accept loads when properly prepared by
authorized load planners. Personal preference is not an acceptable reason for refusing loads.
Loads will be refused only when they exceed aircraft limitation or affect flying safety. The load
planning section is responsible for the preparation and accuracy of cargo/mail manifests.
NOTE: Aerial ports associated with Aerial Delivery (AD) will accomplish load plans for AD
loads, as required. EXCEPTION: The aircraft loadmaster/boom operator may deviate from
load plans to facilitate ease of on-load or offload of cargo, accommodate additional passengers,
and to alleviate unnecessary aircraft reconfiguration. The aircraft loadmaster must take into
consideration the next station's cargo configuration requirements and will ensure the aircraft is in
proper weight and balance limits. When deviations are made, the aircraft loadmaster/boom
operator will acknowledge by annotating changes and applying signature to the AF IMT 4080 or
automated load plan.
76. Load Planning Qualifications. Qualified personnel assigned to the load planning section
must possess extensive job knowledge, be familiar with equipment/procedures utilized within the
airlift system, have a 5-skill level, and meet the training requirements of AMCI 24-101, Vol. 22,
Training Requirements for Aerial Port Operations. Load planning trainees must have their load
plans countersigned by an authorized load planner. For military, document all training in
accordance with AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, in the individual's training record,
AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, and the Training Business
Area (for appropriate users), as well as the supervisor's record of employee (for civilians), as
appropriate.
77. Load Plans
   77.1. Integrated Computerized Deployment System (ICODES) implementation. For AMC
   units, ICODES will be the primary method for completing load plans, and the AF Form 4080
   will be the method for completing manual load plans and maintaining qualifications. Initial
   ICODES training will be conducted by the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command
   (SDDC). This course will qualify unit individuals as trainers. Once initial training is
   complete, AMC units have six months to complete local training. Individuals assigned as
   trainers will instruct classes or perform OJT at home station. Training will be annotated
   IAW applicable guidance.
       77.1.1. ICODES System Change Requests (SCR): For system’s issues with ICODES, load
       planners will submit SCR’s. This will assist the developers in the continued development of
       ICODES. For SCR instructions and the SCR Form go to the following website:
       https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/AFP40/d/1074111948/Files/a4t/a4ti/gates/hello.html .
       77.1.2. AF Form 4080. For Instructions on filling out the AF Form 4080, refer to
       Attachment 8. For sections A and B (Part IV), utilization of the GATES brief sheet is
       acceptable (annotate “See GATES Brief Sheet”) in Proper Shipping Name Column. For
       section C, utilization of the load pull sheet or manifest is acceptable (annotate “See Load
       Pull Sheet”) in TCN Column. If GATES is unavailable, the backside of the AF Form
       4080 will be filled out. Use of a locally produced automated product is authorized (i.e.,
       excel spreadsheet) for AF Form 4080, but it must conform to the AF IMT 4080 version
       located at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/.
 90                                                    AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


78. Cargo Selection Procedures. Select cargo based upon destination, movement priority, and
SET. Note: Load Planning may operate under relaxed “first in first out” (FIFO) authority.
Always consider FIFO when planning loads, but if increased aircraft utilization can be achieved,
load planners have the authority to deviate from FIFO requirements where it makes sense.
EXCEPTION: AMC MICAP, registered mail, Life or Death, Human Remains, 999, and
perishable rations will be selected ahead of other cargo or mail regardless of SET. Green/Purple
Sheet cargo are moved on the first available mission, but will not displace cargo already
manifested on departing aircraft, unless directed by 618 AOC/APCC. Green Sheet cargo
requested by a particular service will be moved ahead of that service's cargo only, without regard
to SET. For additional information on the movement criteria for Green Sheet/Purple Sheet
cargo, refer to AMCI 24-101, Volume 9, Attachment 6. If Code J baggage is held in the port for
5 days due to inadequate airlift, the ACA/CSB/air freight officer, or equivalent, will upgrade the
priority of the baggage from TP-2 to TP-1 IAW this volume. Load planning personnel will
report upgraded TP-1, Code J shipments in the daily backlog. Movement for TP-4 will be IAW
this volume. Cargo/mail transportation priorities and detailed Green/Purple Sheet procedures are
outlined in DTR, Part II, Chap 203. Load planners will make every effort to maximize payload
up to the constraint of the actual ACL (not standard planning weights) for each segment of the
flight. Note: Aerial ports are authorized to maximize SAAM/contingency mission utilization by
filling empty aircraft space with channel cargo destined to same APOD. AMC/FMFN will bill
cargo appropriately based on TAC and mission type.
79. Hazardous Materials.
   79.1. Hazardous materials must have an AMC Form 1015 completed IAW this volume at
   originating stations.
   79.2. Hazardous materials will be consolidated to the greatest extent possible, consistent
   with compatibility requirements of AFMAN 24-204_IP. See AFMAN 24-204_IP, Chapter 2,
   for compatibility waivers.
   79.3. Hazardous materials compatibility for foreign-owned or controlled aircraft will be
   IAW AFMAN 16-101, International Affairs and Security Assistance Management. Note:
   Load planners should sequence loads to provide maximum utilization of the aircraft and ease
   of offload to expedite cargo at en-route and/or destination stations. However, ease of offload
   will not take precedence over safety of flight. In these cases enroute/destination stations may
   have to re-handle cargo based on the load commodity, size, or special handling
   characteristics.
   79.4. Passenger Deviations. Load planners may be assigned authority to approve passenger
   deviations as determined by local management. For specific information, refer to AMCI 24-
   101, Volume 9, Attachment 4.
80. Mail Selection Procedures. Select mail in accordance with the procedures identified
above. The chief of the Air Mail Terminal (AMT), or designated representative, initiates Green
Sheet actions for all registered mail, non-registered airmail letters and parcels to maintain a
reasonable level of mail service to locations which are served exclusively by military aircraft.
Exercise judgment when selecting mail for flights to multiple destinations when available ACL
will not accommodate all mail categories to all destinations. In such instances, priority should
first be given to letter mail for less frequently served locations, etc.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                    91


81. Load Inspection. Load planners must physically inspect loads to ensure airworthiness and
fit within the aircraft configuration it is planned for (i.e., tie-down, overhang, center of balance,
markings, weight, height, cleanliness, shoring requirements, contact points, etc.). When load
planning cargo already aboard an aircraft, i.e., thru load cargo, a physical inspection is not
necessary. However, load planners must ensure thru load hazardous materials are compatible
with manifested originating hazardous material. Note: For locations with enclosed Mechanized
Material Handling Systems (MMHS) which restricts access to pallets, load planners will
physically inspect the cargo load (i.e., pulling pallets out, or coordinating a physical walk of
pallets within the enclosure.
   81.1. For cargo that has special loading issues, load planning and information control will
   coordinate with down line stations to ensure the necessary vehicles, MHE, equipment,
   highline space, storage, and drivers are available to accept the cargo.
82. Final Manifesting. Load planning will ensure that final manifests are prepared for all cargo
and mail loaded aboard an aircraft for each offload station along the route of the aircraft in
accordance with the appropriate publications and the DTR.
   82.1. Load planning will prepare a separate GATES manifest for each of the following
   categories of cargo or mail for each manifest destination.
       82.1.1. General cargo
       82.1.2. Ordinary mail
       82.1.3. AMC MICAP
       82.1.4. Registered mail
       82.1.5. Life or death
       82.1.6. Defense Courier material
       82.1.7. Signature Service shipments (e.g., NWRM)
       82.1.8. Human remains.
   82.2. In the event of automated data processing (ADP) or computer equipment failure during
   the manifesting process, initiate manual backup procedures to produce a manifest to
   accompany the aircraft load. Load planners will utilize either an offline manifest or a DD
   Form 1385 for manual manifesting. The offline manifest must contain all required
   MILSTAMP data and 463L pallet information for weight and balance purposes. When using
   a DD Form 1385 as a manual manifest, the manifest header must be completed IAW AMCI
   24-101, Volume 6, Paragraph 5. Only pallet header and loose cargo/mail data is required in
   the body of the manifest. However, a pallet content listing (i.e., AMC Form 39, Pallet
   Invoice) for each pallet will be attached to the DD Form 1385.
   82.3. Hazardous Cargo Briefing. Information control, ramp coordinator or designated
   representative will brief the aircraft commander or designated representative (e.g.,
   loadmaster/boom operator) concerning hazardous cargo according to AFMAN 24-204_IP,
   Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments. The aircraft commander or
   designated representative will print their name and rank directly below their signature on the
   brief sheet. When the GATES Mission Brief Sheet or ICODES load plan is utilized, load
 92                                                      AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


   planners will print their name and rank directly below their signature on the air terminal
   representative signature block.
       82.3.1. For manual procedures, personnel will ensure the following air terminal
       inspection certification statement is annotated on the DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest,
       with printed name and signature of air terminal representative: "ALL HAZARDOUS
       MATERIALS COVERED BY THIS MANIFEST HAVE BEEN INSPECTED AND
       FOUND TO BE PACKAGED IN THE PROPER OUTSIDE CONTAINER, FREE OF
       VISIBLE DAMAGE AND LEAKS, AND IS PROPERLY CERTIFIED." (Air terminal
       representative signature). Load planners will print their name and rank directly below
       their signature on the air terminal representative signature block. Additionally, ensure the
       following aircrew briefing statement is annotated on the folder with printed name and
       signature of aircraft commander or designated representative: "I HAVE BEEN
       BRIEFED ACCORDING TO AFMAN 24-204 IP, PARAGRAPH 1.2.9., ON
       HAZARDOUS CARGO COVERED BY THIS MANIFEST.” Apply these statements by
       pen and ink, programmed wording, rubber stamps, or typewriter.
   82.4. Ballast loads are not required to be manifested unless local management desires non-
   TWCF documentation for local accountability.
   82.5. Aircraft assets which are installed components or in direct support of the aircraft which
   is being operated (e.g., mission support kits) are not governed by DTR, Part II, will not be
   entered into the DTS as billable TWCF cargo and will not be manifested. Dedicated non-
   billable items being moved for exclusive use by the transporting aircraft are identified in the
   GDSS remarks sections (Form 59) by 618 AOC mission planners. This applies to both non-
   hazardous and hazardous aircraft assets. While a Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods
   is not required, it is the responsibility of the owning organization to ensure assets are
   properly prepared for air transport (fuel levels, center of balance, etc.) to protect the safety of
   the aircraft, aircrew, and passengers.
       82.5.1. Aerial ports will assist with loading of aircraft assets, if necessary. Use the
       remarks section of AMC Form 77 or AMC Form 68 to document loading. Aerial ports
       will also identify assets on the MLR and annotate on AMC Form 4080 or automated load
       plan when aircraft contains manifested cargo.
       82.5.2. Items/equipment moved to support other than the transporting aircraft or when
       removed from the transporting aircraft and shipped separately are not considered aircraft
       assets. Such items/equipment must have a billable TAC and must be prepared,
       processed, and manifested as cargo IAW the DTR and AFMAN 24-204_IP (if
       hazardous).
83. Manifest Distribution. Originating stations will produce the minimum amount of copies of
each final cargo or mail manifest that will meet stations need for all cargo/mail manifests. En
route and destination station can produce their copies from GATES. One originating manifest
will be placed in the outbound document packet. Make a copy of each AMC MICAP manifest
for the terminating station so it can be handed over to the customer at the aircraft, if needed.
   83.1. Electronic format is no longer required for non-deployment missions; however, some
   non-GATES locations still have the requirement. Load planning should verify with these
   stations if a disk is necessary or if an electronic file in E-mail format will suffice.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  93


84. Load Plan Accuracy/Distribution: The load planning section will prepare a load plan
showing the placement of all cargo aboard a channel/opportune mission. They will ensure that
all information on the load plan, regardless of method (i.e., AALPS/ ICODES/AF Form 4080) is
accurate, complete, and that there are enough copies to satisfy all air terminal work center needs.
Load planning will attach all associated shipment documents to the manifest and send to
information control. (e.g., DD form 1252, US Customs Declaration for Personal Property
Shipments, DD Form 1387-2, AMC IMT 1033, ATTLA Certification letters, hazardous cargo
brief sheet, etc.) When the hazmat brief sheet is required, the aircraft mission folder (AMC Form
302) will include enough copies for the loadmaster and all intransit stations.
   84.1. When load planning AMC aircraft, all load planning functions will attempt to place
   the load C/G at or as close to optimal flying C/G percent of Mean Aerodynamic Cord
   (MAC) as possible, without decreasing or directly affecting current velocity/efficiency
   initiatives. When passenger load information is unknown, plan the load C/G to the Zero
   Fuel percent of MAC listed below.
       84.1.1. For C-5: Optimal Zero Fuel is 38% of MAC (36% MAC when passengers and
       baggage are unaccounted for) IAW AFI 11-2C-5v3 add-a, para 4.2.1.
       84.1.2. For C-17: Optimal Zero Fuel C/G is based on aircraft operating weight IAW TO
       1C-17A-1.
           84.1.2.1. Aircraft zero fuel weight less than 400K = 40.0 % of MAC.
           84.1.2.2. Aircraft zero fuel weight 400K – 425K = 39% of MAC.
           84.1.2.3. Aircraft zero fuel weight 425K – 447K = 38% of MAC.
       84.1.3. For C-130: Optimal Zero Fuel is 20-22% of MAC IAW AFI 11-2C-130V3 add-
       a, para 5.2.
       84.1.4. For KC-10: Optimal Zero Fuel is 24% of MAC IAW AFI 11-2KC-10v3 add-a.
       84.1.5. For KC-135: Optimal Zero Fuel is 25% of MAC (IAW TO IC-135(K)R-1-1) and
       will be adjusted during flight by the aircrew as fuel burns and the C/G shifts forward.
   84.2. Due to the inability to accomplish some required structural inspections prior to depot
   level maintenance, several C-5 aircraft are restricted to a maximum zero fuel weight of
   590,000 lbs. and a zero fuel C/G to be planned in the range of 28% to 36%. To ensure
   maximum velocity of C-5 cargo missions, load planners are reminded to validate Level 1
   flight/load restrictions for C-5 aircraft IAW TO 1C-5A-1, Figure 5-17. Additionally, review
   appropriate C2 functions and Form 59 data to identify C-5 aircraft that have been identified
   as having Level 1 flight/load restrictions.
   84.3. 618 AOC flight managers will give HIK, TCM, SUU, CHS, DOV, and RMS their
   maximum ACL only for aircraft flying on active legs. Flight managers will not provide
   MAX ACLs for positioning/de-positioning missions.
   84.4. Load Planning shall strive to maximize utilization first on commercial, then organic
   missions, and channel before opportune airlift, to the greatest extent possible to achieve 90%
   ACL and/or 80% cube (volume weight) utilization IAW Precision Loading goals posted on
   AMC/A4TC Web page, at url:                   https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/AFP40/d/
   1074111948/Files/a4t/a4tc/cargo/precision/hello.html.
 94                                                   AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


   84.5. Load plan distribution.
       84.5.1. Send original copy of load plan and all associated shipment documents to
       information control for preparation of the MLR and AMC Form 77.
       84.5.2. Give the second copy of the load plan to ramp services for load pulling and
       aircraft upload.   The ramp supervisor will annotate this copy to reflect any
       discrepancies/changes and return it to ATOC after aircraft upload.
       84.5.3. Give the third copy of the load plan to information control to brief the
       loadmaster/boom operator, and provide the loadmaster/boom operator with a working
       copy. ATOC must approve adjustments to the completed load plan.
85. Air Transportability Test Loading Agency (ATTLA). Refer to paragraph 58 of this
instruction.
   85.1. Load planners and joint inspectors must maintain an active account for
   viewing/verifying ATTLA certification letters. Personnel can apply for an ATTLA
   account at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?filter=oo-en-ka-02
   to obtain certification letters when needed. The OPR for ATTLA is ASC/ENFC DSN
   785-2330/ Commercial number 937-255-2330, email address: attla@wpafb.af.mil.
86. AMC Commercial Contract Airlift Load Planning Responsibilities. The responsibility
for load sequencing to include weight and balance of commercial aircraft rests entirely with the
specific carrier. Consult the AMCPAM 24-2 series, Civil Reserve Air Fleet Load Planning
Guides, for general planning guidance. Specific guidance related to the capabilities and
limitations associated with a specific type of commercial aircraft may be obtained by contacting
the carrier representative handling the mission. Contact TCAQ-CO at 618-402-2369 if you
cannot locate a carrier representative. Load planning will prepare a load plan IAW with this
paragraph once the load sequence is received from a carrier representative.
87. Overboard Venting of Cryogenic Liquid Storage and Transfer Tanks. All cryogenic
liquid storage and transfer tanks (unless "excepted" in AFMAN 24-204_IP) must be vented
overboard the transport aircraft. The shipper is responsible for providing specific venting
instructions in the Shipper's Declaration of Dangerous Goods and for providing the equipment
needed to vent the container overboard. Preparation and hookup of the vent system will be
accomplished by qualified shipper or aircraft maintenance personnel IAW the procedures
outlined in TO 37C2-8-1-127, Liquid Oxygen and Nitrogen Overboard Vent System, C-130, C-
17 and C-5 series aircraft. ATOC prearranges for a qualified person to make the hookup at the
desired time. Air terminal personnel and aircraft loadmaster/boom operators are not qualified for
these tasks.
88. Dry Ice on Commercial Contract Aircraft. The acceptable industry standard for dry ice
on commercial cargo aircraft is 200kg (440 lbs.). Some carriers allow shipment of dry ice
exceeding this quantity. If a waiver is required, contact the carrier representative before
contacting 618 AOC.
89. Terminal Inventory. In order to reconcile transportation records with cargo and mail
actually on hand, load planning or designated representative will conduct a daily inventory of
outbound cargo and mail within the air terminal.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                   95


   89.1. Air terminal inventories will encompass the entire terminal, to include the frustrated
   cargo area. However, Special Handling is exempt from this policy and will conduct
   inventory according to this volume, Section F - Special Cargo. The inventory is not
   restricted to a count of cargo on hand; rather, it must also include quality control actions to
   include correction of TCMD data, location of cargo, physical appearance (leaks, damage, and
   condition of package), correct placard, etc. The inventory will also include updating the
   computer data base to correct minor discrepancies. Data discrepancies noted and correctable
   during the inventory will be corrected as soon as possible. Load planning will monitor
   discrepancies sent to functional areas (not corrected during the inventory) to ensure timely
   corrective action. Discrepancies involving missing cargo that has been previously listed will
   be reconciled with the records, reports, and analysis section using "can't locate" files, over or
   short shipment procedures, etc.
   89.2. GATES outbound cargo on-hand report or equivalent will be used for terminal
   inventories. Ensure all information on reports is correct and all cargo is located in the correct
   location. Load planning or designated representative will maintain copies of the current
   outbound cargo and mail inventory to provide historical aerial port data for use by load
   planning and port management functions. Local management will determine retention time
   for this information.
   89.3. Non-channel aerial ports not generating TWCF cargo are not required to segregate
   cargo into grid/bay locations. These ports will ensure all cargo is accounted for and maintain
   database integrity. Local port management will establish procedures for controlling cargo
   and monitor for timely movement to final destination.
90. Movement of Dry-Iced Biological and Other Hazardous Materials on Aeromedical
Evacuation (AE) Missions. Dry-iced biological and other hazardous cargo may be shipped on
AE missions, provided pre-coordination with the Medical Crew Director (MCD) or appropriate
AE Cell.
   90.1. Movement of cargo and passengers with patients on AE missions. Please refer to AFI
   11-2AE, Vol. 3, Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Operations Procedures.
   90.2. Biological specimens cannot be an infectious disease specimen.
   90.3. The cargo must be manifested and the aircraft commander or designated representative
   must be briefed IAW AFMAN 24-204_IP.
   90.4. AE missions are not to be delayed awaiting cargo. Additionally, the flight/medical
   crew should not be delayed in terminating their post mission duties to wait for personnel to
   accept cargo.

Section J—Aircraft Loading/Offloading

91. General Requirements.
   91.1. Aircraft onloading/offloading requires skillful preparation and close coordination
   between air terminal work centers. Safety is the paramount consideration. Registered mail,
   classified cargo and AA&E shipments should never be planned for missions scheduled to
   RON at offshore non-US bases without coordination. The only exception is when the
   material is accompanied by escorts or couriers to ensure security during scheduled ground
 96                                                   AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


   times. The special handling section, load planners, and load pull crew must watch for
   possible violations of this restriction and initiate corrective action when necessary.
   91.2. Load team crew chiefs are the aerial port’s last step in the quality control process and
   should cross check details on the load pull sheet against the cargo markings and types of
   cargo to prevent shipping cargo to unauthorized destinations and exceeding aircraft
   limitations.
92. Responsibilities.
   92.1. Ramp Services is responsible for ensuring that all manifested cargo and mail is
   onloaded and offloaded as required. The special handling section is only responsible for
   onloading or offloading loose shipments of "life or death urgency" material, AMC
   MICAP/VVIP, signature service cargo and registered mail. Load crews will assemble and
   inspect all planned loads for pilferage and movement readiness. Ramp Services personnel
   will load aircraft using an AF Form 4080, automated equivalent or authorized automated load
   plan. If changes occur during assembly or loading, the Load Team Chief will annotate
   changes on a copy of the AF Form 4080/load plan and pass changes to ATOC. The Load
   Team Chief will brief load crews about unique load characteristics and loading prior to actual
   onload or/offload (e.g., explosives, hazardous materials, vehicles, and outsize cargo).
   92.2. Load team chiefs will review the Aircraft Load Team Chiefs Operations
   Guideline/Checklist (Attachment 6 this volume). This guideline/checklist must be present
   during the on/offload of aircraft. Local management may add to but not subtract from this
   guideline/checklist.
93. Safety Considerations During Aircraft Loading Operations.
   93.1. General.      Because of the inherent potential for accidents during aircraft
   loading/offloading operations, constant safety vigilance is extremely vital. Total compliance
   with approved procedures will help eliminate accidents; however, indifferent personal
   attitudes and haste to get the job done cause mishaps. All personnel must be on constant alert
   for potential accidents. Functional managers and supervisors ensure all personnel are aware
   of dangers in high hazard areas. Risk assessments will be conducted as necessary to help
   manage risks. Note: At the discretion of Unit Commanders, HQ AMC/A4T authorizes the
   use of unit funded headsets with microphones, in conjunction with compatible Land Mobile
   Radios (LMRs) to enhance communication during flight line operations, e.g., during
   on/offloading operations. Headsets will meet AFOSH, AF Bioenvironmental standards and
   Weapons Safety Electro-Magnetic Radiation (EMR) requirements. IMPORTANT: The use
   of headsets DOES NOT displace a spotter. Spotters are still required IAW applicable
   regulations and “spotters” will continue to be properly positioned at all times to
   enhance/ensure safe loading operations.
       93.1.1. Metal-wheeled pry bars (J-Bars) are not authorized for use on aircraft cargo
       floors. Only NSN 3920-01-091-3414 or 3920-00-171-4009 pry bars equipped with three
       hard rubber wheels are authorized.
       93.1.2. Comply with safety requirements of paragraph 8, as applicable.
       93.1.3. Cargo transported on K-loaders will be properly secured to the loader deck prior
       to placing the loader in motion.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                97


         93.1.3.1. Restrain each piece of rolling stock forward and aft with the appropriate tie-
         down devices (e.g., CGU-1/B, MB1 or MB2) and engage the integral braking system
         if rolling stock is so equipped. Rolling stock will not be moved from a K-loader until
         it has come to complete stop. When offloading single axle rolling stock, at least one
         forward and one aft tie-down device will be used to restrain the rolling stock until
         secured to a prime mover or positioned/controlled by a load team.
         93.1.3.2. Restrain palletized cargo by engaging pallet locks, emergency pallet stops,
         and by using supplemental restraint (see paragraph 8.3) for specific guidance
         concerning K-loader supplemental restraint).
     93.1.3.3. Team Chief/Supervisors are responsible for ensuring safety compliance.
     93.1.4. Pallet trains lengths that exceed K-loader capacity, or pallet trains with overhang
     that prevents engaging both fore and aft emergency pallet stops, will not be transported
     on any type K-loader. If no alternate means are available and it is determined pallet
     handling limitations of a K-loader must be exceeded, an ORM assessment MUST be
     conducted and coordinated/approved by either ATM, Air Freight Officer/Superintendent,
     or ATOC Senior Controller/Duty Officer. The ORM assessment will provide specific
     guidance concerning placement of the pallet train on the loader and ensure down line
     stations are notified of special loading requirements. Use supplemental restraint
     (reference paragraph 8.3) for specific guidance), spotters, etc. If a loading situation
     occurs wherein cargo overhang is a factor, use a second K-loader (if available) mated to
     the aircraft as a bridge to prevent possible damage to the aircraft ramp.
  93.2. Forklift.   Secure pallets to the forklift prior to movement when loading/
  offloading/transporting pallets on forklift with rollerized tines, when pallets are top/side
  heavy, and when snow or ice may have accumulated between the forklift tines and the pallet.
     93.2.1. Secure all objects of irregular shape, including aircraft engines, to the forklift
     mast frame before being raised, lowered, or moved. Place large irregularly shaped
     objects on pallets for stability before transporting. Note: Ensure protruding engine parts
     (afterburners, engine blades, etc.) are not damaged during transport.
     93.2.2. Secure non-unitized warehouse type skids or individual containers of explosives
     to material handling equipment (including forklifts) to prevent movement (AFMAN 91-
     201, Paragraph 8.28.8., http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_se/publication
     /afman91-201/afman91-201.pdf). Positively secure together/unitize stacked explosives prior
     to movement. When forklifts or K-Loaders are used to transport explosives over-the-road or
     outside of the immediate work area, ensure the requirements of AFMAN 91-201, Section 8G
     (two fire extinguishers, DOT placards and wheel chocks) are followed.
  93.3. Wide Body Aircraft. Use loaders designed to service wide body aircraft when
  available. Hi-lift trucks may be used as alternatives. Due to the fuselage contour of these
  aircraft, use extreme care when positioning equipment for on/offload operations.
     93.3.1. When K-loaders without deck extensions are used to service lower lobe
     compartments, they are normally backed to the aircraft. Before attempting to back a K-
     loader, the vehicle operator must ensure the primary spotter is clearly in view and signals
     are understood. Accurate preliminary height adjustment of the loader deck is critical in
     lower lobe operations. The vehicle operator will stop the K-loader approximately 10 feet
 98                                                     AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


      from the aircraft for preliminary height adjustment. Load crew personnel must exercise
      extreme caution when approaching and stepping over the gap between the loader deck
      and aircraft floor as this gap is much greater than in other loading operations.
      93.3.2. Bare tine loading operations may be conducted as needed for training or when
      rollerized tines are not available. Rollerized tines will be used when they are available.
      Note: At no time will any individual (including the spotter) position themselves in the
      direct path of any MHE while it is being positioned for loading operations.
94. Loading Restrictions/Limitations.
   94.1. General. Load cargo in a manner to allow flight crews access to the rear of the aircraft.
   Permanent walkways along each side of the cargo compartment provide required access. No
   part of the cargo/mail load above floor level will protrude beyond the vertical stacking line of
   the pallet. Tie-down devices (straps, chains, cables, etc.) stretched across the aisle will not be
   considered an obstruction unless such devices are higher than 18 inches above the floor, or
   are spaced less than 18 inches apart.
   94.2. Emergency Exits. Consider all exits, including passenger and cargo loading doors
   suitable for personnel evacuation from the main cabin, as emergency exits. Litters erected
   across an emergency exit do not constitute an obstruction.
   94.3. Personnel Seating in Cargo Aircraft. When the load consists of palletized netted cargo
   or floor loaded cargo secured with straps, maintain a 30 inch space between the cargo and the
   nearest forward occupied seat. When the cargo consists of vehicles, canned engines or other
   large items secured with chains and devices, the 30 inch spacing is not required. On KC-135
   aircraft equipped with rollers, maintain a 14-inch space between the seats and the vertical
   stacking line of cargo on pallets. Make seating arrangements to allow passengers to evacuate
   from exits permitting best access to emergency equipment. Note: For exceptions to the 30-
   inch-between-passenger-and-cargo rule, reference applicable Aircraft Loading Manual TO
   1C-XXX-9.
   94.4. Commercial aircraft (narrow-body) lower compartment (belly) loading. Load soft
   materials such as baggage, mail and cardboard boxes in the lower compartment to avoid
   damage to the aircraft. Ensure clearance is maintained around internally mounted auxiliary
   power units and other installed equipment.
      94.4.1. Use extreme caution during loading to prevent damage to the pressure seal of the
      lower compartments, and exercise care in positioning cargo/mail in the compartment so
      the floor or sides of the compartment are not punctured.
   94.5. Palletized Loads.    Follow all requirements and limitations outlined in the applicable
   TO 1C XXX-9.
95. Outbound Load Pulling.
   95.1. Procedures. Ramp services and special handling will receive a load plan/load pull
   sheet from load planning.
      95.1.1. Ramp services and special handling sections will use the load plan/load pull sheet
      to pull the pallets and/or loose shipments from the storage areas and assemble the load.
      Crews will ensure the pallet identifier, destination and weight on the DD Form 2775
      (Pallet Placard) match the data on the load pull sheet. For loose shipments, match the
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                99


      TCN on the label (DD Form 1387) to the shipments on the load pulling document.
      Sequence the load IAW the load pull sheet.
      95.1.2. Inspect all pallets and loose shipments for discrepancies (e.g., damage, pilferage,
      improper tie-down, improper documentation, etc.).
          95.1.2.1. Ensure all dirt, snow, ice, and standing water is removed from pallets prior
          to loading on an aircraft.
      95.1.3. If any discrepancy is noted during inspection and corrective actions are not
      immediately possible, notify load planning so the pallet/piece can be removed and
      supplemented with other backlog cargo.
96. Aircraft Loading.
   96.1. General. For detailed loading information and instructions concerning a specific type
   of aircraft, consult the appropriate TO 1C-XXX-9. Where the TO 1C-XXX-9 is more
   restrictive than this instruction, the TO 1C-XXX-9 will prevail.
      96.1.1. The loadmaster/boom operator receives the load briefing from ATOC. The
      ATOC will coordinate with the loadmaster/boom operator to establish a loading time and
      pass the time to ramp services. Note: The loadmaster/boom operator will receive a load
      brief from Ramp Services at stations without an ATOC section.
      96.1.2. The Ramp Services dispatcher coordinates a loading time with the ATOC and
      dispatches a loading team to load the aircraft.
   96.2. Procedures. The load team chief will conduct a detailed briefing concerning all aspects
   of the load with all members of the load team. The load team chief will ensure all necessary
   equipment is available and delivered to the aircraft (ramp support, bridge plates, chock,
   shoring, etc.) and assigns qualified drivers to operate the MHE to transport the load to the
   aircraft and load the aircraft.
      96.2.1. Loading operations will be a coordinated effort between the load team chief and
      the loadmaster/boom operator/contractor representative, etc. The load team, under the
      direction of the load team chief, assists the loadmaster/boom operator in preparing the
      aircraft for loading. Load teams will not spot MHE to/from aircraft prior to coordination
      with the loadmaster during aircraft on/offload operations. Load teams will not
      load/offload cargo to/from the aircraft without loadmaster coordination. During aircraft
      loading operations, load teams will have positive control of cargo until cargo is secured
      to aircraft rail system/floor.
      96.2.2. Prior to aircraft loading, the load team chief performs a pre-inspection of cargo
      loads, the aircraft cargo compartment, and aircraft loading aids.
      96.2.3. A chock will be placed in position far enough to ensure MHE does not come in
      contact with the aircraft.    K-Loaders must stop at least 10 feet from aircraft for
      preliminary alignment. K-loaders will maintain approximately four to eight inches
      clearance between the rubber bumpers and the aircraft for minor adjustments during
      onloading. Forklifts will also maintain four to eight inches from the front of the fork
      tines and the aircraft. The vehicle operator will not attempt to judge clearances.
      EXCEPTION: During bare tine operations on C-17’s with ramp toes installed, tines
      may extend over the aircraft rollers and into the troughs. Additionally, for the C-130
100                                                    AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


      aircraft, in-theater/austere locations (where proper MHE is limited), forklift tines may be
      positioned in beyond the four to eight inch from ramp requirement, with prior approval of
      the loadmaster. Note: During Forklift Operations the chocker/spotter can be the same
      person if the load team chief/supervisor, forklift operator and spotter/chocker all agree
      that critical clearances can be seen from the position of the chocker/spotter.
         96.2.3.1. Close coordination between the primary spotter and vehicle operator must
         be maintained. Clear and concise signals must be used. In all instances where the
         vehicle operator does not understand, or is not sure of a signal given by the spotter,
         the vehicle operator will stop movement of the vehicle until clarification is received.
         Operators will halt movement of the vehicle any time visual or audible
         communication indicates to do so, or any time he or she cannot see or hear the
         spotter.
      96.2.4. Pallet loading precautions:
         96.2.4.1. Do not use dual rail detents (locks) as pallet stops.
         96.2.4.2. Position pallet side rings in the up position to prevent binding in the rail
         system.
         96.2.4.3. Avoid walking on aircraft restraint rails. Personnel may walk on the C-130
         restraint rails when the guard is in place.
         96.2.4.4. Push pallets onboard the aircraft one at a time.
         96.2.4.5. Avoid pulling pallets onto the aircraft.
         96.2.4.6. Do not position yourself between pallets that are locked in place and those
         being loaded.
         96.2.4.7. Ensure there is adequate clearance when moving loaded pallets onto the
         aircraft.
         96.2.4.8. When pushing pallets onboard aircraft, avoid excessive speeds by
         maintaining control of pallet at all times.
         96.2.4.9. Gravity movement of pallets is prohibited. Note: On/Offload of a knelt C-
         5 does not constitute gravity movement as long as pallets are controlled. MHE
         drivers must use caution when making minor adjustments while pallets transition
         on/off the aircraft ramp.
      96.2.5. Due to the risk of personal injury, lack of training, and government liability of
      damage, aerial port personnel will not operate any electrically powered mechanized
      systems or controls on commercial contracted aircraft. Aerial port personnel may handle
      manual equipment, such as pallet locks, under the supervision and approval of the carrier
      representative.
      96.2.6. Vehicles and rolling stock.
         96.2.6.1. Select licensed/qualified personnel to drive vehicles/equipment on/off the
         aircraft. When a licensed/qualified operator is not available, consider other methods
         of loading. If no other method of loading is feasible or practical, the ramp supervisor
         will notify ATOC. When all efforts to obtain a licensed/qualified operator are
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                101


          exhausted, ramp supervisor will determine the most qualified individual to safely
          operate/ load the vehicle/equipment. The loadmaster/boom operator or APEX
          director directly supervises the loading operation.
          96.2.6.2. If a vehicle/equipment is to be loaded using the aircraft auxiliary ground
          loading ramps, ensure they are properly installed and spaced to align with all wheels
          of the vehicle/equipment to be loaded.
          96.2.6.3. If a vehicle or equipment is to be loaded from the platform of a K-loader,
          ensure bridge plates and truck loading ramps are properly installed and spaced to
          align with all wheels of the vehicle/equipment to be loaded. Also, ensure the aircraft
          ramp support is properly installed.
          96.2.6.4. Install shoring as required. Note: The shipper is required to supply
          specialized shoring for large specialized shipments such as helicopters, mini
          submarines, tracked vehicles, etc.
          96.2.6.5. Ensure fire extinguishers are available.
          96.2.6.6. Ensure there is adequate ventilation in the cargo compartment of the
          aircraft.
          96.2.6.7. Ensure vehicles and equipment are placed in lowest gear, low range, four-
          wheel drive (if applicable).
          96.2.6.8. Check brakes for proper operation.
          96.2.6.9. The loadmaster/boom operator or designated spotter will direct the
          vehicle/equipment into the aircraft and into the preplanned loading position in a very
          slow and safe manner.
          96.2.6.10. Personnel will not walk between the spotter and the vehicle being spotted
          in during aircraft loading operations.
          96.2.6.11. Park vehicles/equipment in the stowed position on the aircraft with
          standard transmission in its lowest gear and set the parking brake. Stow
          vehicles/equipment with automatic transmission in park and set parking brake.
          (EXCEPTION: Park diesel and multi-fueled vehicles/equipment in neutral.)
          96.2.6.12. The vehicle/equipment operator remains at the controls until the initial
          fore and aft restraints are applied.
      96.2.7. Securing Cargo and Pallets. The loading team will assist to ensure all pallets are
      locked into position and all required tie-down is applied upon completion of upload and
      will properly restrain all loose cargo.
      96.2.8. Loose Equipment. Stow all unused tie-down equipment (straps, chains, devices,
      tie-down fittings) in proper storage areas.
97. Special Cargo Loading/Offloading.
   97.1. Signature Service Cargo. The special handling representative will ensure the
   accountability of all signature service cargo loaded aboard an aircraft and transfer of custody
   IAW paragraph 40 of this volume.
102                                                     AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


  97.2. Human Remains (HR). Stow transfer cases aboard aircraft with the head toward the
  nose of the aircraft and ensure the head is higher than the feet. This will normally be
  accomplished by stowing the case on the aircraft or pallet in a level position. No other cargo
  or miscellaneous items, besides other HR shipments, may be placed on top of HRs. Due to
  their time-sensitive nature, HR will not be bumped unless their continued movement
  precludes mission accomplishment or impacts flight safety. Coordinate bumping of HRs
  with 618 AOC/APCC through the ATOC. Transfer of custody will be accomplished IAW
  paragraph 41 of this volume. Load HRs aboard aircraft so they are among the last items to
  be jettisoned, if necessary.
  97.3. Registered Mail Loading. Registered mail should be the last item loaded aboard an
  aircraft and, if possible, loaded in a position readily accessible to the responsible crew
  member. Transfer of custody will be accomplished IAW paragraph 44 of this volume.
  97.4. Hazardous Materials. Observe utmost precautions when handling or transporting
  hazardous materials. Only trained/qualified personnel may handle/load/offload hazardous
  materials on aircraft. Load all hazardous materials aboard aircraft in a manner to afford easy
  accessibility and ready inspection in-flight. Hazardous cargo that is considered jettisonable
  shall be positioned aft of non-jettisonable cargo (e.g., rolling stock, pallet trains, etc.) except
  when its size, weight, and location will permit jettisoning by hand. Adhere to the following
  safety precautions when loading hazardous cargo:
      97.4.1. Proper ventilation.
      97.4.2. Aircraft placarding.
      97.4.3. No smoking.
      97.4.4. Fire extinguisher availability.
      97.4.5. Aircraft electrical grounding (when required IAW TO 00-25-172).
      97.4.6. Thorough inspection of cargo.
      97.4.7. Stowage away from heater outlets and other heat or electrical sources.
      97.4.8. Medical personnel notified, if radioactive material is damaged.
      97.4.9. Use of protective clothing and equipment as required when handling hazardous
      materials.
  97.5. Aircraft overboard venting of cryogenic liquid storage and transfer tanks. All
  cryogenic liquid storage and transfer tanks (unless accepted in AFMAN 24-204_IP) must be
  vented overboard the transport aircraft. The shipper is responsible for providing specific
  venting instructions in the Shipper’s Declaration of Dangerous Goods and for providing the
  equipment needed to vent the container overboard. Preparation and hookup of the vent
  system will be accomplished by qualified shipper or aircraft maintenance personnel IAW the
  procedures outlined in TO 37C2-8-1-127, Liquid Oxygen and Nitrogen Overboard Vent
  System, C-130, C-17 and C-5 series aircraft. ATOC prearranges for a qualified person to
  make the hookup at the desired time. Air terminal personnel and aircraft loadmaster/boom
  operators are not qualified to make the hookup or disconnection.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               103


98. Aircraft Offloading.
   98.1. General. Ramp services is responsible for offloading all terminating cargo and mail
   from the aircraft and delivering it to the terminating cargo receiving area. For detailed
   offloading information and instructions concerning a specific type of aircraft, consult the
   appropriate TO 1C-XXX-9.
   98.2. Procedures. Ramp services and special handling receive information on inbound
   aircraft from ATOC including a complete load break down as soon as it is available. Ramp
   services will use the load breakdown to determine the equipment needed to offload the
   aircraft.
      98.2.1. The ramp services dispatcher receives an arrival time for the aircraft from ATOC
      and assigns a team to offload the aircraft. The offloading team ensures all necessary
      equipment is available and meets the aircraft as expeditiously as possible.
      98.2.2. All offloading operations will be a coordinated effort between the load team chief
      and the loadmaster/boom operator or APEX director.
      98.2.3. The offload team, under the direction of the load team chief, assists the
      loadmaster/boom operator in preparing the aircraft for offload.
      98.2.4. The special handling representative will ensure the accountability of all special
      cargo offloaded from aircraft and transfer custody IAW paragraph 97 of this volume.
      98.2.5. Position MHE at the aircraft for offloading in the same manner as for loading
      (reference paragraph 96).
      98.2.6. Similar precautions that apply to the loading of pallets and rolling stock also
      apply to the offloading of this cargo (reference paragraph 96).
      98.2.7. Ramp services delivers the load to the terminating cargo processing section.
      When possible, keep mission loads together and process loads in order of aircraft arrival
      and priority. Special handling shipments should be delivered directly to the special
      handling section.
99. Shoring Kits.
   99.1. General. Aircraft services will maintain sufficient quantities of shoring kits according
   to items in Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) library to meet each UTC
   LOGDET requirement.
100. Nuclear Cargo Loading.
   100.1. General. Nuclear airlift missions are one of the most important types of missions in
   the airlift system. Contingency/emergency airlift procedures are in AFI 11-2C-XXX, Vol. 3,
   and AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations.
   100.2. Shoring and Equipment Requirements (Stockpile):
      100.2.1. Aerial port/Logistics Readiness Squadrons maintain nuclear shoring kits as
      outlined below to support Primary Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) during peacetime and
      contingency/emergency requirements levied by the operating wing in support of
      AMC/OPLANS. The unit PNAF Program Manager will ensure nuclear shoring kits are
      maintained.
 104                                                   AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


       100.2.2. Issue and Return. Administer the issue and return of shoring from the
       respective storage kits as follows:
          100.2.2.1. The responsible aircrew loadmaster/boom operator notifies the ATOC, or
          appropriate office, of the type and amount of shoring required for the planned mission
          using the AMC Form 292, C-17A Special Loading Equipment Receipt.
          100.2.2.2. The unit storing and maintaining the shoring stockpile fills the
          requirement and delivers the shoring to the aircraft, along with AMC Form 292
          prepared in duplicate, for transfer of accountability. This applies to the loading of
          training kit components as well as kit components loaded on flyaway missions.
          100.2.2.3. The responsible aircrew member inventories and receipts for items
          received. The storing unit keeps the original copy of AMC Form 292, and the
          duplicate copy is given to the aircrew member.
          100.2.2.4. Upon return of the shoring equipment to the storing unit, it must be

101. Missile Loading/Offloading. Load missiles IAW instructions contained in the aircraft TO
1C-XXX-9-2.
102. Aircraft Loadmaster/Boom Operator Responsibilities. As a primary crew member of
cargo aircraft, loadmasters/boom operators are direct representatives of the aircraft commander.
They plan loads, handle troops/passengers, prepare equipment for airdrop, supervise loading, tie-
down, and offload cargo, mail, and baggage. They participate in the aerial delivery of
equipment, supplies, and personnel from aircraft in-flight. They are trained in aircraft
emergency procedures and aircraft weight and balance computations. The loadmaster/boom
operator reports for duty in advance of flight departure to receive the load description from
 106                                                  AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


ATOC to verify the traffic load plan (plans loads at non-AMC stations). The loadmaster/boom
operator also performs assigned aircraft preflight actions, coordinates with appropriate air
terminal activities, supervises onload and offload of the aircraft and completes the DD Form
365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F-Transport/Tactical. For additional detailed
loadmaster/boom operator responsibilities, see applicable AFI 11-Mission Design Series (MDS)
Vol. 3.
103. Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM), Joint Airborne/Air Transportability
Training (JA/ATT), and Other Support Type Missions.
   103.1. General. At locations having a positioned Contingency Response Wing (CRW),
   when tasked, will provide aerial support such as compiling the transported force's
   documentation, identifying special handling requirements, sequencing loads in order of
   movement precedence, providing for consolidated load delivery to the aircraft, and
   accomplishing required load briefings. When there are no AMC CRW or transportation
   support personnel, the unit being moved or host mobility force accomplishes these functions.
       103.1.1. At stations, airports, contractor and/or manufacture sites, or other locations
       where AMC air terminal or transportation personnel are not available, the shipper
       accomplishes ground servicing functions by providing sufficient qualified personnel and
       handling equipment required for the loading and offloading operation.
   103.2. AFMAN 24-204_IP, Chapter 3 moves will be identified in the aircraft Mission Detail.
104. AMC Aerial Port Expediter (APEX) Program. The purpose of the APEX program is to
provide Aerial Port management flexibility in scheduling its manpower and resources for aircraft
loading/unloading independent of aircrew availability. The APEX program is not to be used as
an aircrew enhancement program. Note: ATOC will coordinate with the aircrew to avoid
interference between APEX loading and aircrew training/evaluations. AMCI 24-101, Vol. 7,
AMC Aerial Port Expediter Program, provides additional guidance and program administration
procedures.
105. Engine Running Onload/Offload (ERO) Procedures for C-130, C-17 and C-5 Aircraft.
   105.1. General. The ERO procedures listed below expedite the flow of aircraft through
   airfields during airland operations where the reduced ground time warrants a departure from
   normal operating procedures. The ATOC is designated as the coordinating and approving
   authority for aerial port ERO support (reference AMCI 24-101, Vol. 9, for specific
   guidance). ATOC is the aerial port coordination and approving authority for ERO request.
   ERO operations may be accomplished if:
       105.1.1. When to use EROs. EROs are used to expedite the flow of aircraft through
       airfields during operations where the reduction of ground time warrants a departure from
       normal operating procedures. This is primarily useful in combat or contingency airlift
       operations. ERO operations in other than contingency or combat situations should be
       used primarily as training opportunities, but can be used to achieve increased velocity
       when the mission requires it.
           105.1.1.1. Appropriate provisions of AFI 11-202, Vol. 3, General Flight Rules, are
           met. Follow the following guidelines when performing ERO’s.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                             107


     105.1.2. Applicable aircraft. EROs operations may be performed only on C-130, C-17,
     and C-5 aircraft IAW applicable guidance available in DTR, Part III, Appendix Y. Safe
     EROs on C-21 aircraft can be performed and will require only coordination with the
     aircrew and following applicable regulations (AFI 11-2C-XX-V3) and the operational
     risk management principals described in paragraph 10.
     105.1.3. Approval process and types of EROs. Effective immediately, ATOCs are
     designated as the coordinating and approving authority for aerial port ERO support. In
     addition, as aerial port or maintenance mission requirements dictate, ATOCs can request
     an ERO through the command post who will in turn coordinate with the crew. ERO
     requests must be based solely on mission requirements. Furthermore, the determination
     to perform an ERO should enhance velocity, training and mission effectiveness. EROs
     are not approved for convenience. For the purpose of this message, ERO requests are
     identified in three main categories:
        105.1.3.1. Short notice request: Short notice requests from aircrews will not
        normally be approved. When necessary, requests must be a coordinated effort
        between the aircrew, ATOC, aircraft maintenance, local command and control and
        when necessary, 18th AF AOC/TACC.                 For arriving aircraft, aircrews or
        port/maintenance activities should request ERO support NLT 30 minutes prior to
        arrival, but earlier requests are preferable. In cases when an ERO may be necessary
        for departing aircraft, request and coordination should be made at crew show time.
        This will allow operational risk management (ORM) assessments (see paragraph 10),
        work center coordination, essential workload adjustments, passenger preparations and
        ERO safety briefings.
        105.1.3.2. Non-running to running ERO request: This is a request to start engines
        during on-loading activities. Under normal (strategic airlift) conditions, this type
        request should only be considered for C-17 aircraft. The primary goal of this
        category is to reduce aircraft preflight preparation time or to accommodate any last
        minute loading or maintenance situations. Aircraft commanders will contact the
        AMC command post or similar C2 function to request this category of ERO.
        Command post will in turn notify ATOC. Non-running loading operations will be
        maintained during the ATOC coordination/approval process (no engine start without
        approval). After ATOC approval, a safety briefing of all members by the mission/leg
        loadmaster or aircrew representative must occur prior to transitioning to EROs.
        ATOC will notify the passenger processing function for the purpose of passenger
        preparation. The presence of an ERO-trained loading crew is required once it has
        been determined that an ERO will be performed. However, the overall supervision of
        loading activities, and control and safety of loading personnel, will be the
        responsibility of the primary mission/leg loadmaster.
        105.1.3.3. Pre-planned EROs based on mission directive, OPORD, or JA/ATT: This
        is the preferred method for aerial port support of this capability. The ATOC
        capability forecasting office will assist in planning aerial port actions following the
        applicable guidance outlined in paragraph 103.1 above.
        105.1.3.4. Explosive operations. Aircraft laden with hazardous class division 1.1
        thru 1.3, 1.5 and 1.6, will only be provided ERO support if authorized by an
108                                                 AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


         Operations Order (OPORD). Aircraft laden with hazardous class division 1.4. may
         be provided ERO support without an OPORD. Aerial ports will verify through local
         command and control or 18 AFAOC/APCC that cargo in these classes is moving
         under an OPORD. EROs laden with any explosive (Class/ Division 1.1 thru 1.4)
         require especially thorough operational risk management consideration.
         105.1.3.5. Passenger operations. Passenger service agents must brief passengers
         about the ERO prior to boarding.        Space available passengers (space-A) are
         authorized during ERO operations, and are best briefed during the space-A roll call.
         IAW AMCI 24-101 Volume 14, space-A passengers may elect to remove themselves
         from ERO missions without losing their position in the space available backlog. At
         no time will passengers be loaded or unloaded while explosives are being loaded or
         unloaded.
         105.1.3.6. Procedural Guidelines/Checklists. Use of the applicable ERO checklist is
         mandatory for all EROs performed on C-5, C-17, and C-130 aircraft. These
         guidelines/checklists can be found in Attachments 3 through 5 of this volume.
  105.2. Ground Support Team. A ground support team consists of aerial port, maintenance,
  and user personnel (as applicable) formed as one overall and cohesive unit. The number of
  such teams depends on the number of aircraft anticipated to be on the ground at the same
  time.
      105.2.1. Team structure.
         105.2.1.1. A maintenance team consists of one aircraft maintenance parking director
         and two assistants. Note: Airfield or CRG commander may direct use of ERO
         parking director assistants. Decision to require assistants will be based on airfield
         conditions (e.g., limited clearance or personnel/equipment, traffic congestion). Non-
         maintenance personnel can perform as assistants if wing tip clearance is not critical.
         105.2.1.2. A load team consists of one 2T2X1 as team chief and at least two
         additional personnel. Type aircraft and load determine team size. User personnel
         will augment as requested by the loading team chief.
      105.2.2. Team equipment.
         105.2.2.1. Onload and offload personnel will be equipped with gloves, steel-toed
         boots, hearing protection, and goggles. During hours of darkness or reduced
         visibility, reflective vests/belts will be worn.
         105.2.2.2. Other equipment will include the following as required:
             105.2.2.2.1. Extra sets of C-130 auxiliary ground loading ramps.
             105.2.2.2.2. Vehicle with front mounted pintle hook (prime mover).
             105.2.2.2.3. C-130 ramp support (milk stool).
             105.2.2.2.4. MHE as required.
             105.2.2.2.5. Illuminated wands.
      105.2.3. Team duties - onload:
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                              109


       105.2.3.1. Maintenance:
          105.2.3.1.1. As aircraft taxies into a parking spot, the parking director and
          assistants will locate themselves in a position to expeditiously accomplish their
          assigned tasks.
          105.2.3.1.2. The maintenance parking director directs the aircraft to the parking
          spot. After the aircraft comes to a complete stop, clear the area forward of the
          aircraft and position one person immediately aft and 20 ft outboard of each wing
          tip to ensure the area remains clear.
       105.2.3.2. Load Team.
          105.2.3.2.1. The load team chief will ensure a combination safety briefing and
          safety check is conducted prior to the start of ERO operations (reference this
          volume’s ERO Checklists for more details, listed in Attachments 3 through 5).
          Briefing topics include hand signals, route to aircraft, load team position, type of
          cargo, specific on/offloading instructions, and use of MHE. PPE/safety items
          checked will include reflective vests/belts, gloves, ear protection devices, steel-toe
          boots and goggles. (EXCEPTION: Goggles are optional for C-17 and forward
          loading C-5 aircraft).         Vehicle and troop directors use distinctive
          clothing/equipment such as reflective vest and wands for night operations.
          Vehicle operators will remain in their vehicles when within 50 ft of aircraft (C-5:
          200 ft, C-17: 25 ft) and until vehicle is secured aboard aircraft with one chain
          forward and one aft.
          105.2.3.2.2. Loading team chiefs maintain complete control of their teams,
          positioning them in a preplanned area clear of engine exhaust, and at least 50 ft aft
          (C-5: 200 ft, C-17: 25 ft) of the aircraft when it has stopped. The pre-planned
          area should be on the outside of the aircraft’s turning radius and clear of engine
          exhaust.
          105.2.3.2.3. The loading team will not approach the aircraft until all engines are
          in low speed ground idle or reverse thrust. (C-5 loading team does not approach
          the aircraft until the crew entrance door is deployed and the scanner has
          deplaned). At night, wing leading edge lights may be on to enable the ground
          crew to monitor engine danger areas.
          105.2.3.2.4. When the aircraft has stopped and engines are in low speed ground
          idle or reverse thrust (on C-5 scanner has deplaned), the load team chief will
          rapidly position the team via a route that will take them perpendicular to the
          aircraft’s fuselage, at least 50 ft aft (C-5: 200 ft, C-17: 25 ft) of aircraft, until
          reaching aircraft center line where they will turn and approach the aircraft.
          WARNING: Load teams will remain clear of aircraft cargo ramp until positioned
          for onload.
          105.2.3.2.5. The loading team positions support MHE as required. Trained team
          personnel install the extra set of aircraft auxiliary ground loading ramps as
          required. Team members may assist the aircraft loadmaster/boom operator in
          positioning stabilizer struts.
110                                                    AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


             105.2.3.2.6. Under the direction of the team chief, vehicle operators position the
             load at least 50 ft (C-17: 25 ft) aft and slightly to the right or left of the aircraft
             fuselage, leaving a clear path behind the aircraft. (C-5: load will be positioned a
             minimum of 200 ft fwd and aft and slightly to the right or left of the aircraft
             fuselage.)
             105.2.3.2.7. The aircrew loadmaster retains overall responsibility for loading the
             aircraft. The load team chief will coordinate with the aircrew loadmaster to
             present the manifest and discuss the load sequence, ground vehicle direction and
             tie-down pattern, and obtain the completed, outbound DD Form 365-4, Weight
             and Balance Clearance Form F - Transport.
             105.2.3.2.8. A minimum of two personnel will go aboard and assist in preparing
             the aircraft for a specific load. Other personnel position the first piece of
             equipment to be loaded at the bottom of the aircraft cargo ramp.
             105.2.3.2.9. The ground vehicle director takes a position clearly visible to the
             vehicle driver. Note: If trailers are pushed aboard, the vehicle director takes a
             position on the driver side of the prime mover.
             105.2.3.2.10. Positioning the load inside the aircraft requires load team members’
             assistance in observing load clearance.
             105.2.3.2.11. When onload is complete, except for ramp load, troops are directed
             aboard by the troop director. All personnel are to remain a minimum distance of
             50 ft (C-5: 200 ft, C-17: 25 ft) from the aircraft until reaching the aircraft
             centerline from where they will be directed by the team chief to the aircraft.
             Complete ramp loading after all troops are on board.
             105.2.3.2.12. Trained team members may assist in stowing the auxiliary loading
             ramps on the aircraft cargo ramp and placement of extra auxiliary loading ramps
             in the ERO team vehicle as required. When the aircraft is secured, the team chief
             stops 50 ft (C-5: 200 ft, C-17: 25 ft) aft on the aircraft centerline and signals with
             thumb up (hand signal) to inform the aircrew loadmaster/boom operator the load
             team and equipment are all clear of aircraft.
      105.2.4. Team Duties - Offload:
         105.2.4.1. Maintenance. Same as onload. WARNING: Load team personnel will
         remain clear of the aircraft cargo ramp until it is positioned for offload.
         105.2.4.2. Load Team. Same as onload. (Additional duties outlined below)
             105.2.4.2.1. If troops are aboard, they are deplaned at the direction of the aircraft
             loadmaster/boom operator as soon as the auxiliary loading ramps are installed (C-
             5: as soon as the fwd and/or aft ramps are deployed). Instruct troops to proceed a
             minimum of 50 ft aft (C-5: 200 ft fwd/aft, C-17: 25 ft aft) of the aircraft before
             turning left or right and continue parallel to the aircraft’s wing a minimum of 300
             ft (C-17: 200 ft) before stopping.
             105.2.4.2.2. The Team chief will coordinate offload procedures and conditions
             with the aircrew loadmaster and receive the manifest and outbound DD Form
             365-4. EXCEPTION: C-130 loadmasters are not required to present a
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                 111


             completed DD Form 365-4 when the aircraft is departing empty (reference AFI
             11-2C-130, Vol. 3, C-130 Operations Procedures, for specific details).

sustainment cargo already on hand at an APOE for subsequent flow into the CENTCOM area of
responsibility per the Defense Transportation Regulation, Part III, Chapter 304.2a(3). The
Purple Sheet process authorizes specifically identified cargo in the AMC system in-transit to the
CENTCOM AOR, including 999 and Green Sheet shipments, regardless of service lane or
arrival date at the APOE. The COCOM utilizes Purple Sheeting to expedite movement of
specific shipment(s) of National interest and operation necessity. Purple Sheet applies from
initial identification to the shipments final destination APOD.
Radio Frequency Identification— A family of technologies that enables hands-off processing
of material transactions for cargo deploying through the Defense Transportation System. Radio
Frequency Identification (RFID) provides operators a means to remotely identify, categorize, and
locate material automatically within relatively short distances. Data is digitally stored on RFID
transponder devices, such as tags or labels. Remote interrogators (located a few inches to 300
feet from the transponder device) electronically retrieve the data via electromagnetic energy
(radio or microwave frequency) and send the data to the Automated Information Services (AIS).
The technology is divided into two categories of data storage and retrieval systems – passive and
active. Active RFID systems are omni-directional and require moderately expensive high-
capacity transponder devices. Active devices are effective portable databases and facilitate the
rapid transfer of data to AIS with standoff capability. Passive systems generally require line-of-
site interrogation of powerless, inexpensive, low capacity transponder devices. Passive devices
are adaptable for use at the item, case, and pallet level.
a. Active RFID (aRFID) Tag. Active RFID tags receive low—level radio frequency (RF)
signals from an interrogator and then generate high-level signals back to the reader/interrogator,
which can be either a hand-held device or permanently mounted device. Data is normally
written to an a RFID tag via a docking station or Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable, but may also
be written via radio signals.
b. Passive RFID (pRFID) Tag.—Passive RFID is an emerging technology that is exhibiting
great potential in the commercial industry. Passive RFID tags reflect energy from the
reader/interrogator or receive and temporarily store a small amount of energy from the
reader/interrogator signal in order to generate the tag response. Passive RFID requires strong RF
signals from the reader/interrogator, while the RF signal strength returned from the tag is
constrained to low levels by the limited energy. Therefore, their interrogation range is much
shorter than that of the aRFID tags. These tags are more suited for individual shipments of
cargo.
Refrigerated Cargo— Straight or mixed loads of cargo requiring enclosed temperature
controlled transportation and storage.
Report of Shipment— An advance notification of shipment provided by a shipper to the
consignee not later than 24 hours prior to the shipment arrival. For ammunition shipments,
notification must be made not later than two hours after shipment departure.
Required Delivery Date (RDD)— The calendar date when material is required by the
requisitioner. Required Delivery Date field may contain 999, E_ _, N_ _, 444, 555, or 777 to
indicate expedited handling required.
Retrograde Cargo— Cargo evacuated from a Theater.

       TUNNER/HALVORSEN/OLDER GENERATION K-LOADER PARKING AND
                         TRAFFIC FLOW PLAN

A2.1. Traffic flow plan. Each aerial port/air terminal operation shall develop a local traffic
flow plan using operational risk management (ORM) tools. The traffic flow plan will delineate
traffic flow/direction within the air freight compound, the flight-line, vehicle servicing area, fuel
pumps, and other areas where the k-loaders may travel. The plans should include primary and
secondary routes to ensure safe routes are available in case of road construction, adverse weather
conditions, etc. When changes occur to the primary or secondary routes, the traffic flow plan
must be updated.
   A2.1.1. These procedures will be coordinated with local safety offices and will address
   minimum clearance from obstacles and spotter use. Use AFI 91-203 and AFMAN 24-306 as
   guidance when developing these procedures.
   A2.1.2. When operating in locations/conditions not explicitly addressed by local traffic flow
   plans, a spotter is mandatory when operating within 15 ft of any obstacle. Also, a spotter is
   mandatory in congested areas and inside the aircraft circle of safety.
A2.2. Parking. K-loaders unattended or not positioned for immediate use are considered
parked. Operators and all supervisors must apply sound judgment toward parking and storage.
A2.3. K-Loader parking plan.
   A2.3.1. Be aware of the Tunner loader’s unique turning radius, minimum of 50 ft. A Tunner
   pulling forward into a hard turn will swing approximately 6 ft. The back-end of the loader
   where maximum swing occurs will be approximately 25 ft forward of the location where the
   turn was initiated. Other K-loaders that do not have articulated steering will swing, but to a
   lesser degree than a Tunner.
   A2.3.2. Each Tunner parking spot shall have 7.5 ft of clearance on each side and 5 ft of
   clearance in front and rear. As a result, a Tunner, being approximately 15 ft wide, will sit in
   a 30 by 60 foot parking area. In cases where two or more parking spots are adjacent (side-
   by-side), the 7.5 ft of clearance may overlap between the parking spots, so a minimum 7.5 ft
   of clearance remains between the parked Tunners, side-to-side. For all other K-loaders, the
   parking spot will have 5 ft of side clearance on all sides, so that the resulting parking spot is
   10 ft wider and 10 ft longer than the maximum dimensions of the loader. As with the
   Tunner, adjacent side-to-side clearance may overlap, so a minimum of 5 ft is maintained
   between the sides of non-Tunner K-loaders (must be 7.5 ft minimum if one of the two
   adjacent loaders is a Tunner). In cases where two or more parking spots are end-to-end, the 5
   ft of clearance may overlap between the parking spots, so a minimum 5 ft clearance remains
   between the parked Tunners, end-to-end. No obstacles will reside within the boundaries of
   the parking spot. Drive through parking spots are desired but not mandatory.
   A2.3.3. Before pulling into a parking spot, ensure the loader is directly in line with the
   parking spot. This will ensure the vehicle does not enter the parking spot at an angle. A
   painted line or suitable marking 15 ft before the entrance of the parking spot shall mark the
   minimum distance at which the loader must be straight before entering the parking spot.
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                                  131


   A2.3.4. When exiting parking spots, the loader shall be kept straight before turning until the
   aft end is clear of the parking spot. A painted line or suitable marking not less than the
   length of the loader (50 ft for Tunners) in front of the parking spot is what the front of the
   loader must cross before maneuvering to ensure the rear of the loader has cleared other
   parked loaders.
   A2.3.5. “Taxi lines” shall be placed where the center of the cab will travel so the loader is
   centered in the parking spot. These taxi lines shall extend to the entry/exit line markings
   mentioned in the two preceding paragraphs. Aligning the loader’s cab directly over the taxi
   line will center the loader in the parking spot during parking operations.
A2.4. Covered Storage Parking.
   A2.4.1. Each unit will include in their local traffic flow plan detailed covered storage
   parking procedures using each existing bay, if feasible and safe. Drive through parking is
   desired but not mandatory. One spotter, positioned to optimize the safety of the operation, is
   required for all maneuvering through covered storage, provided the following four
   paragraphs are complied with.
   A2.4.2. Each covered storage parking location will allow 2.5 ft of clearance on each side of
   the loader during the most constrained portion of the parking process. For a Tunner, this
   means the most constrained portion of the entrance, parking spot, and exit will not be less
   than 20 ft wide. In cases where two or more parking spots are adjacent (side-by-side), the 2.5
   ft of clearance may overlap between the parking spots, so a minimum 2.5 ft clearance
   remains between the parked Tunners, side-to-side. No obstacles will reside within the
   boundaries of a parking spot. At locations with existing entrance doors that are less than 20
   ft wide but at least 18 ft wide, comply with the requirements in paragraph 2.5 below.
   Maintain 5 ft of clearance from the front and rear of the loader; end-to-end parking with a 5 ft
   buffer separation is permissible. Doors and overhead obstacles should be at least 15 ft
   (desired, not mandatory) above the parking surface.
   A2.4.3. Before pulling into the covered storage, ensure loader is directly in line with the
   parking spot. This will ensure the vehicle does not enter the parking spot at an angle. A
   painted line or suitable marking, 15 ft before the entrance of the most exterior obstacle, shall
   mark the minimum distance at which the loader must be straight before entering the covered
   storage.
   A2.4.4. When exiting parking spots, the loader shall be kept straight before turning until the
   aft end is clear of the most exterior obstacle of the covered storage. A painted line or suitable
   marking, not less than the length of the loader (50 ft for Tunner) in front of the most exterior
   obstacle, is what the front of the loader must cross before maneuvering to ensure sufficient
   clearance.
   A2.4.5. Taxi lines shall be placed where the center of the cab will travel so the loader is
   centered during parking operations.
A2.5. Deviation requirements. Units with parking spots that fail to comply with the
requirements specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 will do one of the following two options.
   A2.5.1. Use two spotters when maneuvering in parking areas; in this case no deviation
   request is required.

  A2.5.2. Incorporate ORM to establish the best option for their location. Forward deviation
  request to AMC/A4TR with local safety office coordination attached. AMC/A7/A4/SEG
  will approve/disapprove deviations. Deviations for covered storage facilities approved using
  above criteria are confirmed as permanent deviations and do not need to be resubmitted. All
  outdoor parking deviations will be valid for 2 years after approval.

A3.1. GENERAL INFORMATION
   A3.1.1. The ERO procedures listed below expedite the flow of aircraft through airfields
   during all air-land operations where the reduction of ground time warrants a departure from
   normal operating procedures. EROs will only be used for validated operational requirements
   after prior coordination through appropriate channels (i.e., AMCC, 618 TACC, AMD, etc.).
   ERO operations may be accomplished under the following conditions:
       A3.1.1.1. The six-step ORM process must be considered prior to commencing with
       ERO operations:
          A3.1.1.1.1. Identify the hazards.
          A3.1.1.1.2. Assess the risks.
          A3.1.1.1.3. Analyze risk control measures.
          A3.1.1.1.4. Make control decisions.
          A3.1.1.1.5. Implement risk controls.
          A3.1.1.1.6. Supervise and review.
       A3.1.1.2. The on/offload airfield may be transited on an operational stop basis and no
       safety of flight conditions exist. Coordinate between the aircraft commander, any
       existing local command and control function (i.e., Command Post, AMCC, CRG, CRE,
       or CRT, if applicable), and the effected functional areas approving ERO operations.
       Evaluate such risks as day/night operations, weather, experience levels, type of cargo,
       passengers, and location of operations.
       A3.1.1.3. Braking action on the ramp is such that there is no danger of the aircraft sliding
       with brakes set. Chocks will not be used.
       A3.1.1.4. Normally, the ramp and cargo doors are used for on/offloading. Exception:

A5.1. GENERAL INFORMATION
   A5.1.1. The ERO procedures listed below expedite the flow of aircraft through airfields
   during all air-land operations where the reduction of ground time warrants a departure from
   normal operating procedures. EROs will only be used for validated operational requirements
   after prior coordination through appropriate channels (i.e., AMCC, 618 TACC, AMD, etc.).
   ERO operations may be accomplished under the following conditions:
      A5.1.1.1. The six-step ORM process must be considered prior to commencing with ERO
      operations:
          A5.1.1.1.1. Identify the hazards.
          A5.1.1.1.2. Assess the risks.
          A5.1.1.1.3. Analyze risk control measures.
          A5.1.1.1.4. Make control decisions.
          A5.1.1.1.5. Implement risk controls.
          A5.1.1.1.6. Supervise and review.
      A5.1.1.2. The on/offload airfield may be transited on an operational stop basis and no
      safety of flight conditions exist. Coordinate between the aircraft commander, any
      existing local command and control function (i.e. Command Post, AMCC, CRG, CRE, or
      CRT, if applicable), and the effected functional areas approving ERO operations.
      Evaluate such risks as day/night operations, weather, experience levels, type of cargo,
      passengers, and location of operations.
      A5.1.1.3. Braking action on the ramp is such that there is no danger of the aircraft sliding
      with brakes set. Chocks will not be used.
      A5.1.1.4. Normally, the ramp and cargo doors are used for on/offloading. Exception:
      Circumstances may dictate use of the crew entrance door for on/offloading. This will be
      coordinated through the aircraft commander, Command and Control Function, and
      effected functional areas.
 144                                                     AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013


       A5.1.1.5. During adverse weather, ensure vehicle operator’s vision is not obscured by
       the elements. Self-propelled vehicles may require winch assistance if positive traction of
       vehicle wheels cannot be maintained throughout the on/offload operation. Arctic/nonskid
       shoring may be used in lieu of a winch.
       A5.1.1.6. Do not use ERO procedures when explosive cargo is involved (with the
       exception of small arms ammunition—class/division 1.4) unless authorized by the
       JA/ATT Exercise Operations Order, or Contingency Air Tasking Orders.
       A5.1.1.7. At night, wing leading edge lights may be on to enable ground crews to
       monitor engine danger areas.
       A5.1.1.8. Ensure passengers are briefed on all safety requirements. Passengers should
       have or will be offered hearing protection prior to loading/offloading operations.
A5.2. Warnings, Cautions, and Notes. The following definitions apply WARNINGS,
CAUTIONS, and Notes found in the guideline/checklist.
   A5.2.1. WARNING: Operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in personal
   injury or loss of life if not carefully followed.
   A5.2.2. CAUTION: Operating procedures, techniques, etc., which could result in damage
   to equipment if not carefully followed.
   A5.2.3. Note: An operating procedure, technique, etc., which is considered essential to
   emphasize.
A5.3. Ground Support Team.
   A5.3.1. A ground support team consists of aerial port, maintenance, and user personnel (as
   applicable) formed as one overall and cohesive unit. The number of such teams depends on
   the number of aircraft anticipated to be on the ground at the same time.
   A5.3.2. Team structure and equipment:
       A5.3.2.1. A maintenance team consists of one aircraft maintenance parking director and
       two assistants. Note: Airfield or CRG commander may direct use of ERO parking
       director assistants. Decision to require assistants will be based on airfield conditions (i.e.,
       limited clearance or personnel/equipment traffic congestion).              Non-maintenance
       personnel can perform as assistants if wing tip clearance is not critical.
       A5.3.2.2. A load team consists of one 2T2 as team chief and additional personnel as
       determined by the type of aircraft and load. Deploying unit personnel will augment as
       requested by the loading team chief.
       A5.3.2.3. Onload and offload personnel will be equipped with gloves, steel-toed boots,
       hearing protection, and goggles. During hours of darkness or reduced visibility,
       reflective vests/belts will be worn.
       A5.3.2.4. Vehicles with front mounted pintle hook (prime mover).
       A5.3.2.5. MHE (as required).
       A5.3.2.6. Reflective vests/belts and wands (as required).

     A5.3.3.1. All personnel involved in the ERO at the aircraft will receive a briefing on
     procedures and safety prior to beginning ERO operations. The loading team chief
     conducts the briefing. The load team chief will brief the loadmaster at the aircraft.
     A5.3.3.2. The loading team chief highlights key topics such as hand signals route to and
     from the aircraft, load team position, cargo type, special on/offloading instructions, and
     use of any MHE. The load team chief will check to ensure all personnel and passengers
     have the required safety items as required (i.e., hearing protection devices, steel-toed
     boots, etc).
  A5.3.4. Team duties--onload:
     A5.3.4.1. Maintenance:
        A5.3.4.1.1. As aircraft taxi into a parking spot, the parking director and assistants
        will locate themselves in a position to expeditiously accomplish their assigned tasks.
        A5.3.4.1.2. The maintenance parking director directs the aircraft to the parking spot.
        After the aircraft comes to a complete stop, clear the area forward of the aircraft and
        position one person immediately aft and 20 ft outboard of each wing tip to ensure the
        area remains clear.
     A5.3.4.2. Load team:
        A5.3.4.2.1. The load team chief will ensure a combination safety briefing and safety
        check is conducted prior to the start of ERO operations. Briefing topics include hand
        signals, route to aircraft, position of load team, type of cargo, specific on/offloading
        instructions, and use of MHE. Personal safety items checked will include goggles,
        reflective vests/belts, gloves, hearing protection, and steel-toed boots. Vehicle and
        troop directors utilize distinctive clothing/equipment such as reflective vest and
        wands for night operations. Vehicle operators will remain in their vehicles when
        within 200 ft of aircraft and until vehicle is secured aboard aircraft with one chain
        forward and one aft.
        A5.3.4.2.2. Loading team chiefs will maintain complete control of their teams,
        positioning them in a preplanned area a minimum of 200 ft fwd or aft of the aircraft
        when it has stopped depending on method of loading/unloading. The preplanned
        area should be on the outside of the aircraft’s turning radius and clear of engine
        exhaust, if aft of the aircraft.
        A5.3.4.2.3. When the aircraft has stopped and engines are in low-speed ground idle
        or reverse thrust, the load team chief will rapidly position the team via a route that
        will take them perpendicular to the aircraft’s fuselage, at least 200 ft fwd or aft of
        aircraft depending on method of loading/unloading, until reaching aircraft center line
        where they will turn and approach the aircraft.
     A5.3.4.2.4. The loading team will not approach the aircraft until the crew entrance door
     is deployed and the scanner has deplaned. In all cases the load team will not proceed to
     the aircraft until signaled by an aircrew member.

         A5.3.4.3.1. The preferred method for offloading/onloading is the C-5 in the fwd
         kneel, drive in position. Under the direction of the team chief, vehicle operators will
         arrive or depart the aircraft a minimum of 200 ft fwd and slightly to the right or left of
         aircraft fuselage, leaving a clear path to the aircraft. Only one piece of loading
         equipment is to be directed to approach the aircraft at any given time.
         A5.3.4.3.2. The aircrew loadmaster retains overall responsibility for loading aircraft.
         Load team chief will coordinate with aircrew loadmaster to present manifest, discuss
         load sequence, ground vehicle direction, tie-down pattern, and obtain completed,
         outbound DD Form 365-4F, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F--Transport.
         A5.3.4.3.3. Load team personnel will go aboard and assist in preparing the aircraft
         for a specific load. Other personnel position the first piece of equipment to be loaded
         at the bottom of the aircraft cargo ramp.
         A5.3.4.3.4. The ground vehicle director takes a position clearly visible to the vehicle
         driver. Note: If trailers are pushed aboard, the vehicle director takes a position next
         to the driver’s side cab of the prime mover.
         A5.3.4.3.5. Positioning the load inside the aircraft requires load team members’
         assistance in observing load clearance.
         A5.3.4.3.6. When cargo onload is complete, except for ramp load, troops are directed
         aboard by the troop director. All personnel are to remain a minimum distance of 200
         ft from aircraft until reaching aircraft centerline from where they will be directed by
         the team chief to the aircraft. Ramp loading will be completed after all troops are on
         board.
         A5.3.4.3.7. When aircraft is secured, the team chief stops 200 ft (fwd or aft as
         required) on aircraft centerline and signals with thumb up to inform the aircrew
         loadmaster the load team and equipment are all clear of aircraft. Note: C-5 load
         team members will always approach the aircraft from the front.                When
         offloading/onloading pallets using the alternate method through the aft doors of the
         C-5, the person chocking the K-loader will approach the aircraft from the nose and
         escorted to the rear of the aircraft by the scanner. WARNING: Load team personnel
         will remain clear of aircraft cargo ramp until positioned for onload.

      loadmaster and receive manifest and outbound DD Form 365-4F.
      A5.3.5.5. Additional team members position themselves to the side of the aircraft ramp
      until all troops have deplaned. Team chief directs team aboard to remove any remaining
      tiedown restraints, beginning with the first vehicle to be offloaded and working forward
      or aft as required.
      A5.3.5.6. The ground vehicle director takes a position 25 ft to the rear of the aircraft and
      directs vehicles 200 ft forward or aft before turning to left or right to receiving area.
      A5.3.5.7. Offloading team departs aircraft after ensuring all tiedown equipment is
      positioned on aircraft centerline. Stow tiedown in containers during kneeling and
      unkneeling if time permits.
      A5.3.5.8. When aircraft is secured, the team chief stops 200 ft forward or aft of aircraft
      centerline and gives thumb up to inform aircrew loadmaster the team and equipment is all
      clear of aircraft.
A5.4. Personnel Loading/Offloading:
   A5.4.1. Exiting/entering over the forward cargo ramp is the preferred method when
   passengers are involved on the C-5. Deplane passengers before offloading cargo and load
   passengers after onloading cargo, unless cargo size and location dictate otherwise.
   A5.4.2. Crew entrance door loading:
      A5.4.2.1. Onload and offload using the crew entrance door will be in accordance with

Attention: All Team Chiefs will strictly adhere to the guidance of Loadmasters/APEX Load
Directors. Cargo will not be handled loaded/offloaded without coordination. Note: Load Team
Chief will walk the entire load before cargo heads to the aircraft. This will ensure proper load
setup. Inspect all pallets for air worthiness, tight/serviceable tie-down, pallet damage, and
cleanliness. Verify with load planning that roller limitations have not been exceeded.
   A6.1.1. Assign crew duties (spotter, chocker, driver)
   A6.1.2. The Load Team Chief is ultimately responsible for load team and cargo safety
   during operations. The Load Team Chief must complete a safety briefing prior to
   commencing operations. The briefing must cover at a minimum – established evacuation
   route(s) and rally point for emergencies, any environmental limitations (i.e., ice/snow,
   temperature, poor visibility, etc.) and PPE/gear requirements and verify requirements for fall
   harness. (WARNING: Special attention should be given when performing loading
   operations with a 60K Tunner loader through the nose of the B-747 airframe. A safety
   hazard exists along the loader’s front right-hand side; there is a gap of 2 to 4 ft between the
   loader rails and the airframe. During loading operations, ensure heightened awareness and
   brief personnel to stay clear of this area.)
       A6.1.2.1. When performing pallet loading and spinning operations with K-loaders from
       the rear of C-5/C-17 aircraft, pay special attention to the adjacent open ramp area.
       Ensure heightened awareness of fall potential and brief personnel to stay clear of this
       area. This also applies to C-5 front ramp loading.
       A6.1.2.2. During loading operations from the side of the aircraft (KC-10, KC-135, DC-8,
       etc.) brief all personnel of the gap that exist between the K-loader right rail and the
       airframe. This also applies to belly loads on commercial aircraft. Stay clear of area and
       ensure awareness is heightened during loading operations.
       A6.1.2.3. When loading C-130 aircraft beware of a safety hazard that exist on the right
       side; there is a gap between the loader rail and the airframe. During loading operations,
       ensure heightened awareness and brief personnel to stay clear of this area.
       A6.1.2.4. Load teams will not spot MHE to/from aircraft prior to coordination with the
       loadmaster during aircraft on/off load operations.
       A6.1.2.5. Load teams will not load/offload cargo to/from the aircraft without loadmaster
       coordination.
       A6.1.2.6. During aircraft on-load operations; load teams will have positive control of
       palletized cargo until cargo is secured to aircraft rail system/floor.
       A6.1.2.7. Personnel will not walk between the spotter and the vehicle being spotted in
       during aircraft loading operations.

       accidents
       A6.7.1.3. Evacuate area and account for personnel (if needed)
          A6.7.1.3.1. Withdrawal Distances for AE Not Involved in Fire. The initial
          decision to evacuate non-essential personnel will be based on the type of AE involved
AMCI24-101V11 27 FEBRUARY 2013                                                               151


        and its susceptibility to become more unstable, armed, or hazardous. Good judgment,
        with regards to protecting personnel from the hazards of the AE or surrounding area,
        must be exercised. When evacuation is considered necessary, or is required by other
        technical guidance, clear the area to a distance of 300 feet (125 feet for simulators and
