MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION

FROM: AETC/CC
     1 F Street, Suite 1
     JBSA Randolph TX 78150-4324

SUBJECT: AETC Guidance Memorandum for Post Deployment Stand-Down

RELEASIBILITY: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.

1. By Order of the Commander, Air Education and Training Command, this Guidance
Memorandum reiterates the post-deployment stand-down policy for AETC units following
extended TDYs. It is our intent to provide all AETC Airmen an opportunity to recover and
reconstitute after lengthy deployments.

2. This policy ensures AETC members who support contingencies receive time off to get caught
up in their personal lives and return to duty re-energized and ready to take on new challenges. It
also provides commanders with flexibility and guidelines to determine and schedule post-
deployment stand-down time.

3. Commanders will provide 7 days post-deployment stand-down time for members deployed 42
days (6 weeks) or longer. Four days of the stand-down time will be processed as a 4-day special
pass IAW AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, paragraph 8.3. In addition, members will be
afforded the opportunity for an additional 3 days of post-deployment recovery and reconstitution
time in the local area. For deployments lasting 12 weeks or longer, members will receive 14
days post-deployment stand-down time. Stand-down time will be processed as a 4-day special
pass, plus 10 days of local area recovery and reconstitution. If members elect to travel outside
the local area, normal leave will be charged, and leave days will be subtracted from the amount
of stand-down time allotted.

4. Commanders should provide their people the opportunity to schedule post-deployment stand-
down time as quickly as operationally feasible. Members should be given the appropriate time to
tend to personal and professional matters in the local area. Realizing mission requirements may
not allow stand-down time in the near term, commanders should ensure those deserving
individuals have their stand-down time honored within 90 days of their return to home station.

5. Personnel who supported the fight at home station should also receive time off. However,
local commanders are in a better position to determine which individuals and/or units operated in
a deployed fashion at home station and can grant “stand-down” time of an appropriate duration.
6. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained IAW Air Force Manual 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air
Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS).

7. If you have any questions on this policy letter concerning military leave, please contact HQ
AETC/A1KM, DSN 487-7723 and for Readiness concerns, HQ AETC/A1RR, DSN 487-9712.

8. This memorandum becomes void after one-year has elapsed from the date of this
memorandum, or upon publication of an Interim Change or rewrite of the affected publication,
whichever is earlier.
