                           POLICIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Overview: Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and DLA began to develop the IPEx SP
beginning in December 2011. IPEx SP integrates existing processes and initiatives to ensure
synchronized requirements, successful supportability elements, and effective maintenance
support. The establishment of the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) provided the
opportunity to improve support to the Air Force enterprise. The goal is to capitalize on best
practices from each ALC to benefit the entire Air Force enterprise and all supply chains. IPEx SP
will provide an end-to-end, sustainment, planning, and execution process managed by
stakeholders including Supply Chain Management Groups (SCMGs), ALCs and Aerospace
Sustainment Directorates (ASDs), Maintenance organizations (MX), DLA, and appropriate
AFLCMC and AFNWC Program Offices.
1.2. Responsibilities:
   1.2.1. AFSC/LG standardizes procedures implemented by policy. It also standardizes
   processes, implements lessons-learned, and promotes a culture of collaboration.
   1.2.2. ALCs are responsible for supporting IPEx SP processes, participation in governance
   structure, and associated tactical, operational, and strategic processes. ALCs drive systemic
   issues correction for planning and execution in depot operations. ALCs drive integration with
   product support and supply chain management for commodities, aircraft, and whole engines.
   1.2.3. SCMGs are responsible for operational and strategic supportability of worldwide
   requirements for end items, aircraft, missiles, and engines.
   1.2.4. AFLCMC and AFNWC Program Offices provide information regarding plans,
   schedules, and background information on specific programs.

                                            Chapter 2

                                     IPEX SP OBJECTIVES

2.1. Purpose: The following IPEx SP objectives establish a foundation for successful
deployment, provide for further process enhancements, and drive improvements in supply chain
reliability and responsiveness. Please note that asterisks (*) indicate elements to be established
before Full Operating Capability (FOC).
     2.1.1. Objective 1: Develop a repeatable process that aligns material supportability with
     repair demand through defined standard work.
     2.1.2. Objective 2: Create a standard approach for prioritizing efforts through supportability
     analysis, business rules, and information technology (IT)*.
     2.1.3. Objective 3: Achieve integration and collaboration and assign responsibilities in
     existing AFSC and DLA chains of command.
     2.1.4. Objective 4: Educate stakeholders regarding IPEx SP benefits and processes.
     2.1.5. Objective 5: Deliver detailed and standardized performance metrics and analysis*.
2.2. IPEx SP: is a comprehensive process providing a thorough approach including repair-
requirements forecasting, execution plans, monitoring, and feedback. IPEx SP’s success depends
on process integration across sustainment activities including DLA, and throughout the AF
enterprise (Figure 2.1).
2.3. This is a new publication and will be reviewed annually to ensure currency. While the
overarching Framework of IPEx SP is included in this document, the detailed processes for Steps
4-Accountablilty, Step 5-Improvement Validation, and Step 6-Instituitionalize Lessons Learned
outlined in Figure 2.1 are still in development: therefore, not included in this current version. The
next revision will incorporate steps four thru six of the IPEx SP Framework.

The paragraph numbers below correspond to the item numbers on Figure 2.1.
1. Daily Standard Work refers to established processes mandated by regulatory guidance.
Daily Standard Work does not change existing processes. Standard work does bring disparate
processes under a unified process-flow and improves communication and collaboration.
2. Local governance includes a site Functional Steering Group (FSG) and a site Executive
Steering Committee (ESC). These FSGs and ESCs include representatives from the ALCs,
SCMGs, ASDs, and DLA. These bodies, as well as higher level cross-functional FSGs and
ESCs, are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.
3. FSGs and ESCs prioritize and select end items suffering from supportability issues for
review to determine causes of supportability issues. Deep Look is one of these review
processes (Chapter 5). Key aspects of Deep Looks include creating score-cards and baselines
of current, end-item support and a part-by-part scrub of the Bill of Material (BOM).
The following are IPEx SP Outcomes.
4. Accountability: IPEx SP drives accountability and decision making to the lowest
organizational levels practical. Most issues will be addressed by daily standard work and
squadron-level leadership. Only when issues arise that squadrons cannot resolve will
elevation occur. System outputs include formal accountability and performance metrics.
5. Improvement Validation: IPEx SP provides systematic means to evaluate and validate
changes made to the supportability enterprise and processes. This ensures that all changes are
actually improvements*.
6. Institutionalize Lessons Learned: IPEx SP provides systematic means to institutionalize
lessons learned. In order to capitalize on best practices from across the enterprise, IPEx SP
distributes lessons learned to FSGs and IPEx SP stakeholders and submits these lessons
learned to the Air Force Lessons Learned Program (AFL2P) *.
Interrelated Components*
IPEx SP includes components that synchronize supply chain requirements and supportability-
assessment capabilities to yield a standard operating plan.
Repair Requirements Forecasting*
IPEx SP captures repair requirements data in accordance with (IAW) the Logistics
Requirements Determination Process Handbook (LRDP) and AFMCMAN 23-1
Requirements for Secondary Items as part of daily standard work. IPEx SP does not generate
repair requirements but uses repair requirements as a necessary input.
AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                                 9


 Operating Plan*
 IPEx SP will produce a standard operating plan for use across the enterprise. Analysis of
 anticipated requirements (over a 24-month minimum rolling horizon), anticipated resources,
 and stakeholder input produces an operating plan. IPEx SP operating plans provide rolling,
 12-month historical views to assess performance. Operating plans are automated products
 available to supply-chain stakeholders. Operating plans bring stakeholders together to
 collaborate on and execute common plans for supporting specific end-items. Operating plans
 serve as vehicles for accountability and execution among supply-chain stakeholders.
 DSCM IPT
 DSCM Integrated Process Teams (IPTs) accomplish detailed analysis of major supply chain
 functions. Refer to Chapter 5 for the details on DSCM processes.

3.1. Leadership Roles.
   3.1.1. Senior leaders fill IPEx SP leadership roles within AF and DLA. IPEx SP brings
   senior leaders together to achieve specific outcomes as detailed below.
       3.1.1.1. Drive action on issues impacting long-term supportability and supply chain
       efficiency.
       3.1.1.2. Drive accountability to the lowest level practical.
       3.1.1.3. Institute lessons learned and best practices.
       3.1.1.4. Establish meeting cadence and forum.
       3.1.1.5. Assign ownership and responsibility.
       3.1.1.6. Ensure progress of action items through to completion.
3.2. Functional Steering Groups (FSGs): include representatives from MX, SCMG, DLA,
and ASD. FSGs address issues that cannot be resolved at lower levels and require leadership
involvement. FSGs provide high-level focus on an array of issues such as planning and
supportability issues, ineffective standard work or policy, resource constraints, and IT or system
constraints. These issues are primarily operational and strategic in nature. FSGs may also address
immediate support issues. FSGs convene monthly as required. FSG participants are identified in
Table 3.2.
   3.2.1. Site FSGs convene monthly as required to address issues relevant to that particular
   site. If they cannot resolve these issues and require additional involvement from senior
   leadership entities at that site, they elevate the issues to the Site Executive Steering
   Committee (ESC). The Site ESC may elevate issues that require involvement from higher-
   leadership entities to the Cross Complex ESC.
   3.2.2. Site FSGs elevate issues that require involvement from across the enterprise to the
   Cross Complex FSG. The Cross Complex FSG elevates issues that require senior leadership
   involvement from across the enterprise to the Cross Complex Executive Steering Committee
   (ESC). Cross Complex FSG participants are identified in Table 3.2.
   3.2.3. FSG members collect agenda items from stakeholders. AF DSCM Chiefs distribute
   agenda items to FSG members. Agenda items may include planning or supportability issues,
   reviews of DSCM or Deep Look findings, best practices, prioritization of items for Cross
   Complex FSG meetings, and review of action items.
   3.2.4. Cross Complex FSG holds quarterly meetings. These meetings are facilitated by an
   AFSC/LG representative and include the attendees from the various Site FSGs at the three
   ALCs, as well as additional participants as identified in Table 3.2. AFSC/LG leads these
   meetings and creates agendas with inputs from the Cross Complex FSG members. The AF
   DSCM Leads will assist in meeting preparations as required. Agenda items may include
   propagating best practices, process changes, required training, IT configuration management
   (CM) (including Depot Supply Chain Management Analysis Tool [DSCM AT]), and
 12                                                      AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014


   outstanding issues that Site FSGs could not resolve. The intent of this meeting is to
   encourage collaboration and information sharing across the enterprise.
   3.2.5. Development of Cross Complex FSG agendas begins with a call for items. Leadership
   submits proposed items. AFSC/LG distributes a list of submitted items, consolidates agenda
   inputs, prioritizes items submitted, and develops proposed agendas. Upon receipt of the
   agenda, the owner of each agenda topic will submit the necessary material to AFSC/LG for
   consolidation and distribution.
3.3. Executive Steering Committees (ESC): meet quarterly and address topics at the strategic
and operational levels. ESC may also address critical tactical issues unresolved at lower levels.
The ESC may elevate items that cannot be resolved at the FSG level. ESC participants are
identified in Table 3.1.
   3.3.1. Site Executive Steering Committees (ESCs) promote a culture of collaboration,
   process improvement, standardization, and accountability. ESC activities may include items
   listed below.
       3.3.1.1. Perform critical issue review.
       3.3.1.2. Review issues that could not be resolved by the FSG.
       3.3.1.3. Prioritize FSGs recommendations.
       3.3.1.4. Identify crosscutting causes and issues and propagate best practices.
           3.3.1.4.1. Direct corrective actions to address any training shortfalls identified.
       3.3.1.5. Eliminate local resource barriers.
       3.3.1.6. Recommend enterprise policy changes.
       3.3.1.7. Approve Deep Look items.
       3.3.1.8. Identify issues for elevation to the Cross Complex ESC.
       3.3.1.9. Local AF DSCM Chiefs organize and facilitate Site ESC meetings when
       required. DSCM Chiefs play key roles in developing the Site ESC agenda based on Site-
       FSG outcomes. Site ESC agendas include issues that could not be resolved by the Site
       FSG, identification of cross-entity issues, causes, and solutions, propagation of best
       practices, and prioritization of Deep Look items.
       3.3.1.10. Local AF DSCM Chiefs distribute the Site ESC agendas quarterly, consolidate
       agenda inputs, and distribute necessary information to ESC participants at least 48 hours
       before scheduled meetings. Participants may include ESC members (see Table 3.1), FSG
       members, end item program managers (PMs), PDMC members, and necessary subject
       matter experts (SMEs).
       3.3.1.11. During Site ESCs, ESC members work toward one of the three following
       outcomes.
           3.3.1.11.1. Resolve the issue.
           3.3.1.11.2. Assign further integrated-process team (IPT) resources to develop
           proposed solutions and report to the ESC.
           3.3.1.11.3. Elevate unresolved issues through appropriate chains of command.
AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                                13


       3.3.1.12. End Item PMs or Logistics Management Specialists (LMSs) execute counter-
       measures and action items. ESCs work with FSG members to ensure lessons learned are
       documented and changes to daily work, captured.
   3.3.2. Cross Complex ESC.
       3.3.2.1. Similar to Site ESC meetings, Cross Complex ESC meetings will convene
       quarterly and focus on the identification of crosscutting issues and reoccurring causes,
       sharing of best practices, discussion of necessary process changes, and identification of
       outstanding issues that require additional high level attention. Cross Complex ESC
       participants are identified in Table 3.1.
       3.3.2.2. AFSC/LG with assistance from the AF DSCM will issue calls for topics to
       develop Cross Complex ESC agendas. AFSC/LG will consolidate and distribute agenda
       inputs, prioritize agenda items, and develop a proposed agenda for Cross Complex ESC
       meetings. Upon receipt of the quarter’s ESC agenda, the owner of each agenda topic will
       submit the necessary material to AFSC/LG for distribution.

3.4. Using Governance to Manage Systemic Supportability Issues.
     3.4.1. The DSCM IPT process is described in paragraph, 5.8.1.1.5, and associated sub-
     paragraphs. As supportability analysis identifies overarching issues, these issues will be
     tracked by DSCM IPTs and Deep Looks using DSCM AT*. Using DSCM AT, the DSCM
     IPT with support as needed from SCM PMs or LMSs, create monthly Pareto Analysis
     Reports to provide prioritization of supportability issues with the greatest impact. This
     information is reported to FSGs and ESCs, which may then establish separate IPTs to
     perform analysis. These IPTs provide their status and solutions to the commissioning FSG.
     The lessons learned process within IPEx SP provides coordination to institutionalize
     solutions to broader applications. Please note that asterisks (*) indicate elements to be
     established before Full Operating Capability (FOC).
3.5. Issue Resolution, Elevation & Governance.
     3.5.1. IPEx SP facilitates early identification of requirement-forecasting gaps and provides
     avenues of issue resolution through an efficient governance structure. PMs or LMSs work
AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                                  15


   with DSCM IPTs to determine causes of disparities and propose adjustments to forecasts and
   Operating Plans. Issues not resolved will be elevated within the IPEx SP construct.
   PMs/LMSs will periodically review the accuracy of their past forecasts to identify causes of
   errors in order to improve future forecast accuracy.
   3.5.2. Elevation occurs either within applicable SCMG, DLA, AFNWC Program Office, or
   AFLCMC Program Office chains of command or within the IPEx SP FSG construct.
      3.5.2.1. All issues are to be resolved at the lowest practical level before elevation to
      supply chain, DLA, or appropriate Program Office leadership. Evaluate issues for
      corrective actions available to first-level stakeholders. If corrective measures are not
      available to first-level stakeholders, FSG members elevate concerns in accordance within
      the IPEx SP construct.
3.6. Sharing & Institutionalizing Lessons Learned.
   3.6.1. Sharing and institutionalizing are practices that leverage lessons learned and propagate
   best practices across the enterprise. FSGs determine best methods to share and propagate best
   practices. Lessons Learned may be captured by PMs or LMSs, DSCM IPTs, or Deep Looks
   using the Lessons Learned template (Attachment 3) or others as appropriate. Lessons
   Learned will be presented to FSGs, distributed to DSCM IPTs, and used as feeders to the Air
   Force Lessons Learned Program (AFL2P). PMs or LMSs, IPT and Deep Look members are
   encouraged to review lessons learned and determine pertinence and value to their particular
   situations. Lessons learned may indicate a need for additional training or development of new
   processes. Such requirements must be vetted through the FSG and ESC. Lessons that may
   have a positive impact across the enterprise or are determined to be mission critical will be
   disseminated using the Joint Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS) in accordance
   with AFI 90-1601, Special Management.

                           REQUIREMENTS FORECASTING

4.1. Within IPEx SP, requirements forecasting reinforces the importance of collaborating
and planning to complete requirements (Figure 4 1). Collaboration and planning will help
ensure accurate piece-part demand plans. IPEx SP and DSCM AT comply with and capture data
from established processes documented in AFMCMAN 23-1 Requirements for Secondary Items
(D200A, D200N) and AFMCI 23-205 Planning for DLA-Managed Consumables (PDMC).

Figure 4.1. IPEx SP Main Categories




4.2. Requirements Data.
   4.2.1. Air Force end-item repair requirements are documented in D200A source systems.
   D200A communicates with the Automated Budget Compilation System (ABCS) which takes
   the requirement and applies budgetary algorithms. The ABCS file is then constrained by the
   448th Supply Chain Maintenance Wing (SCMW) for financial budget information passed
   down from Air Staff. When complete, it is received from the 448 SCMW and input into
   DSCM AT, where the end item requirement is matched against the Bill of Material (BOM)
   and worked for supportability. The Execution and Prioritization of Repairs Support System
   (EXPRESS) is the approved USAF tool for computing and prioritizing repair requirements
   for execution by maintenance. EXPRESS provides EXPRESS Planning Module (EPM)
   information over various planning horizons to DSCM. Processes established by the
   appropriate Program Offices provide the repair requirement for aircraft and engines. These
   schedules are needed to load into DSCM AT by the appropriate Program Office. Aircraft and
   engine requirements will be worked in accordance with the Logistics Requirements
   Determination Process (LRDP) Handbook. Daily standard work for PMs or LMSs, DSCM
   IPTs, and the Deep Look Center will drive formal discussions and highlights the need for
   verification of repair requirements supportability. The PM or LMS shall be used for
   verification of repair requirements and appropriate supportability. It may be possible that
   new factors, changing conditions, and unplanned or non-programmed work come into
   established repair requirements. This will form a new baseline for future supportability
   analysis. If a change to the repair requirement is necessary, the repair requirement will be
   updated through established processes in D200A, as prescribed in AFMCMAN 23-1.
   4.2.2. DSCM IPT will assess whether the piece-part demand plan that supports a given
   repair program is sufficient. If the plan does not support changed demands, the Demand Data
   Exchange (DDE) Process Initiator (PI) will communicate demand-forecast changes for DLA-
   sourced material through the DDE process in accordance with AFMCI 23-205. If piece parts
   are non-DLA managed, communication of this requirement will be through PMs or LMSs to
   the appropriate AFLCMC or AFNWC Program Office or supply-chain manager.
AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                                     17


   4.2.3. DSCM AT users must understand the creation of repair requirements. In summary,
   IPEx SP utilizes source system data (or collaborated input from PM or LMS/Program Office
   when source system requirements data does not exist) to capture repair requirements and uses
   DSCM AT to generate supportability forecasts. These forecasts can be consolidated monthly,
   quarterly, or annually.
4.3. Maintenance of Requirements in Supply Chain Systems.
   4.3.1. Once requirements are passed from the appropriate Program Offices, accuracy of the
   data in the supply chain systems must be verified. Equipment Specialists (ESs) are
   responsible for file maintenance of programmed requirements in D200A. In accordance with
   AFMCMAN 23-1 Chapter 12 Equipment Specialist Review Products, ESs review item
   information for accuracy and completeness. During the D200A file maintenance cycles, the
   ES coordinates with MX Resource Control Center (RCC) Planners to ensure programmed
   requirements are accounted for and non-programmed requirements are captured. Actual
   requirements can only be reconciled by the item manager (IM) and or the ES in accordance
   with AFMCMAN 23-1. All repair requirements (programmed and non-programmed) are the
   responsibility of the appropriate Program Office or 448 SCMW (D200A).
4.4. Communicate Requirements.
   4.4.1. The result of the collective effort is a validated and maintained requirements forecast.
   It is imperative that the responsible authority update relevant systems so that DSCM AT can
   produce accurate parts forecasts. While data loaded into DSCM AT by various stakeholders
   (repair requirement schedules, bills of material, etc.) are not the authoritative data sources for
   this information, it is essential that the responsible stakeholders keep it current so that it
   reflects authoritative data. Effective and standardized communication ensures all
   organizations synchronize around an operating plan to ensure effective and efficient
   supportability planning. DSCM AT incorporates this information into supportability analysis
   as outlined in Chapter 5.
   4.4.2. DSCM AT Action Item Tracker* helps to manage issue resolution from discovery
   through completion. As issues are successfully resolved, best practices and lessons learned
   are applied to the enterprise via the governance instruction outlined in Chapter 3.

                                            Chapter 5

                   SUPPORTABILITY ANALYSIS AND RESOLUTION

5.1. Parts supportability: means having the right quantity of end items at the right time and in
the right place to satisfy repair requirements. Supportability is the ability to satisfy demand over
a 24-month minimum planning horizon (Figure 5.1). For Exchangeables, operational and
strategic timelines are defined as being from 60 to 720 days into the future. Aircraft and whole
engines define operational and strategic according to the LRDP definitions: Strategic – the
period 46-months prior to induction to the earliest of 10-months prior to induction (i.e., until the
brochure is published). Operational – the period of 17 months prior to induction ending 31 days
prior to induction or Job Order Number (JON) opening. Collaboration between all parties,
AFSC, Program Offices, and DLA, ensures that the full requirement is captured and validated.
This validation provides supply chain stakeholders with a solid baseline on which to perform
collaborative analysis and to identify and address non-supportability challenges.

Figure 5.1. IPEx SP Main Categories




   5.1.1. The DSCM IPT was established to review operational and strategic supportability,
   analyze supportability data, and work with process owners to resolve issues that hinder
   supportability.
   5.1.2. DSCM AT is an automated analysis and reporting tool that uses inputs from a variety
   of Air Force and DLA legacy systems. Through analysis of multiple data feeds such as
   requirements, performance, and resource data, DSCM AT calculates supportability postures
   for end items. Visibility of supportability posture allows for structured analysis by the DSCM
   IPT members and adjustments to the operating plan as required.
5.2. DSCM IPT Process.
   5.2.1. SCMG DSCM IPT members work in collaboration with DLA Sustainment Specialists
   (SSs), Customer Support Managers (CSMs), and RCC Planners to research supportability
   issues and develop solutions in collaboration with responsible parties (LMS, PMs, CSMs,
   item managers (IMs), engineers, DLA, RCC Planners, etc.). If non-supportable end item
   issues cannot be resolved through a DSCM IPT, IPT leaders will elevate them to the FSG.
   This process is covered in Chapter 3.
5.3. FSG Resolution (All Supportability Related Issues).
   5.3.1. Non-supportable end items suffering from parts and non-parts related issues will be
   presented to the FSG and ESC for resolution as needed. Issue resolution is covered in
   Chapter 1. FSGs may direct a Deep Look or other action as needed.
5.4. Deep Look.
AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                                 19


   5.4.1. Formal Deep Look is an extensive look at material sustainment of a particular end
   item through careful review of supply chain aspects including the BOM, repair requirements,
   cataloging data (supply signal and supply management codes), weapons system coding,
   supportability posture, stock positioning, demand planning, procurement (contracts, purchase
   requests, etc.), Industrial Prime Vendor (IPV), and forecast accuracy.
   5.4.2. Deep Look outcomes include complete material supportability packages for end items,
   updated files, record maintenance, input back into operating plans, and baselines from which
   to measure future performance.
5.5. Critical Success Factors for Supportability.
   5.5.1. Supportability success relies on four critical success factors: quality of data,
   collaboration, prioritization, and accountability.
       5.5.1.1. Quality of Data: DSCM AT generates outputs (supportability analyses) based on
       data feeds from source data systems. Supportability success depends on the quality of
       data provided. Data drives key decisions.
       5.5.1.2. Collaboration: The End Item PM or LMS will collaborate with all involved
       parties, including the appropriate Program Offices, AFSC, and DLA to ensure end items
       supportability. Collaboration drives understanding of how each organization plans and
       executes. This process allows improvements to the operating plan.
       5.5.1.3. Prioritization: Non-supportable items will be reviewed in this process and
       prioritized based on critical factors such as specific identification of the item as high
       priority by customer or leadership, direct warfighter impact (number of MICAPs, back-
       orders, etc.), projected impact to the production schedule (number of tails / tasks / end
       items / engines affected), extent of non-supportability (projected red duration, number of
       red components on tail / task / end item / engine, etc.), RO fill rate, etc. FSG guidance
       will increase success of supportability efforts by helping IPTs align with the more senior
       perspective and broader viewpoint available to FSGs.
       5.5.1.4. Accountability: As issues are identified and resolved, changes to daily standard
       work will ensure continuous improvement. Accountability at all levels is necessary to
       ensure overarching implementation of improvements.
5.6. Assessing Supportability.
   5.6.1. There are three basic steps to assessing supportability: Review End Item
   Supportability History, Review Piece Part Posture, Monitor and Follow-Up on Existing
   Action Plans and Risks
   5.6.2. Step 1 - Review End Item Supportability History.
       5.6.2.1. The DSCM IPT confirms that forecast end-item or aircraft (AC) task
       requirements will be satisfied with current parts inventories, operating plans, and
       pipelines. These may have been previously verified during Requirements Review and
       Depot Determination (R2D2) or other mid-cycle what-if scenarios. DSCM IPTs verify
       with accountable stakeholders (LMSs, PMs, Program Offices, etc.) that end item
       requirements are valid and action plans or risks are still on track. This allows IPTs to
       work by exception and focus the efforts of the IPT on truly troubled parts.
 20                                                     AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014


      5.6.2.2. The end item report assigns a supportability color based on the supportability
      posture of its piece parts. End item color-coding is derived from the color-coding of its
      components. If one or more end item components are Red for a time interval, the end
      item shows Red for that time interval. If there are no Red components, but one or more
      components are coded Yellow in a time interval, the end item shows as yellow for that
      time interval. If there is no Red or Yellow components in a time interval and all
      components are Green for the time interval, then the end item is coded Green. If there are
      no Red or Yellow components, but one or more components is coded Orange in a time
      interval, then the end item is considered Orange for that interval. Full definitions of color-
      coding for piece parts are provided in the Attachment 7.
   5.6.3. Step 2- Review Piece-Part Supportability Posture.
      5.6.3.1. Operating plans provide drill-downs showing piece-part status of end items,
      specified data elements (outlined in Chapter 6), and calculations based on those elements.
      To indicate each piece part’s supportability status, DSCM AT assigns a color code to
      each part for every quarter of the upcoming 24 months.
      5.6.3.2. Since many end item requirements contain hundreds of piece parts, DSCM AT
      allows sorting by color-code and other data elements (e.g. months of stock). This allows
      users to focus on piece parts that create current or future supportability issues.
      5.6.3.3. As DSCM IPTs perform supportability analysis, they categorize issues affecting
      supportability into high-level groups, which are assigned and tracked in DSCM AT. This
      aids DSCM IPT leadership to prioritize supportability issues, make decisions, and take
      corrective action.
      5.6.3.4. After DSCM IPTs identify which piece parts are causing supportability issues,
      the IPTs work to discover and resolve causes of issues through collaboration and various
      research techniques.
   5.6.4. Step 3- Monitor Existing Action Plans and Anticipated Risks.
      5.6.4.1. Action plans from previous supportability cycles may have persistent issues.
      Until workloads are completed, DSCM IPTs monitor status and associated risks to ensure
      the current get-well plans (as reflected in the operating plan) are valid. Until actions are
      fully executed and results (purchase orders, deliveries, etc.) are reflected in source
      systems, the operating plan must be monitored by the PM or LMS. Any updates to
      actions, status, or risks are updated in DSCM AT and reflected in the operating plan.
5.7. Determining a Supportability Path.
   5.7.1. IPEx SP integrates multiple resolution paths for supportability issues. It is critical for
   items to fall into appropriate paths, depending on the severity and complexity of their
   supportability situation. This section will describe each supportability level and the IPEx SP
   Resolution Process for non-supportable items.
5.8. Levels of Supportability Review.
   5.8.1. In normal operations, supportability is measured at three levels.
      5.8.1.1. Level 1: DSCM IPT.
AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                              21


       5.8.1.1.1. DSCM IPTs continuously monitor DSCM AT for non-supportable items.
       When end items show non-supportable in DSCM AT, those end items are added to
       DSCM IPT prioritization lists for Level 1 analysis. The DSCM IPT process is
       organized into three standardized, sequential steps: analyze supportability issues,
       develop action plans, and make improvements to the operating plan. A high-level
       process flow is contained in Attachment 4.
       5.8.1.1.2. DSCM IPTs exist to increase end item supportability. DSCM IPTs are a
       proactive approach to avert piece part non-availability before a negative impact to the
       supply chain and end-item supportability occurs, leading to long-term supportability
       of end items. DSCM IPTs collaborate closely with PMs, LMSs, AFLCMC Program
       Offices, DLA, engineering, and MX to improve operating plan. End-item PMs,
       LMSs, and DLA CSMs ensure that follow-on activities are completed to achieve
       supportability.
       5.8.1.1.3. Outputs of the DSCM IPT process include the following.
          5.8.1.1.3.1. Non-Supportable Reports (NSRs).
          5.8.1.1.3.2. Collaborative operating plans (via Strategic Supportability Plan
          [SSP*]).
          5.8.1.1.3.3. Lessons Learned and Pareto data.
       5.8.1.1.4. Critical Success Factors.
          5.8.1.1.4.1. DSCM IPTs provides analysis and liaison to integrate and exploit
          capabilities of Program Office, AFSC, and DLA to increase supportability.
          DSCM IPT success depends on three critical success factors: collaboration, action
          plan execution and accountability, and a common and reliable set of data.
              5.8.1.1.4.1.1. Collaboration: End-item or aircraft PMs LMSs, DSCM IPT
              leads and members, SCMGs, DLA CSMs, DLA SSs, and DSCM IPT-
              assigned Mx Planners must work closely to ensure success of the DSCM IPT
              process. Collaboration also includes interaction with functional experts (such
              as IMs, ESs, etc.) who support the DSCM IPT at the appropriate time in the
              DSCM IPT process.
              5.8.1.1.4.1.2. Action Plan Execution and Accountability. Efficacy of
              operating and get-well plans requires process owners to monitor status of
              activities and projected risks and to ensure plan execution. PMs and LMSs are
              ultimately responsible for execution and follow-up on action plans. DSCM
              AT supports this by documenting action-owner identity, anticipated risks,
              follow-up dates, and by reporting them in operating plans.
              5.8.1.1.4.1.3. Common Data Set: Using a common set of data across
              organizations, sites, and suppliers provides advantages for analysis and
              execution of sustainment efforts.
       5.8.1.1.5. The DSCM IPT process is organized into three steps: Analyze
       Supportability Issues, Develop Countermeasures and Action Plans, and Improve
       Operating Plans. A detailed diagram of the DSCM IPT process is shown in
       Attachment 3.
22                                               AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014


        5.8.1.1.5.1. AC, Engines and SCMG PMs and LMSs play crucial roles in DSCM
        IPTs. Although PMs and LMSs may not be directly involved in every step of the
        process, they will be held accountable for executing action plans developed by
        DSCM IPTs and therefore must collaborate during the process. Attachment 5
        describes roles and responsibilities in DSCM IPTs.
     5.8.1.1.6. Step 1 – Analyze Supportability Issues.
        5.8.1.1.6.1. The first step in the DSCM IPT process is to analyze end item and
        piece part supportability issues. This occurs in three parallel paths:
        5.8.1.1.6.2. SCMG members analyze Budget Code 8 (BC8) – Air Force managed
        items.
        5.8.1.1.6.3. DLA sustainment specialists (SSs) analyze Budget Code 9 (BC9),
        both DLA and non-DLA managed items (other services, local manufacture, part
        number requisitions, etc.).
        5.8.1.1.6.4. DSCM IPT Planners analyze items on the designated repair BOM
        (except Industrial Prime Vendor [IPV] items).
        5.8.1.1.6.5. SCMG DSCM members review how piece-part demand plans
        compare to end-item requirements. In cases of discrepancy, SCMG DSCM
        members notify appropriate action owners to make corrections.
        5.8.1.1.6.6. If the demand plan is valid or corrections have been made, the SCMG
        DSCM member analyzes demand plan supportability and researches non-
        supportability issues. Sometimes these become apparent through the associated
        data displayed in DSCM AT. If not, the SCMG DSCM member communicates
        and coordinates with PMs, LMSs, IMs, or ESs to determine causes for non-
        supportability.
        5.8.1.1.6.7. SCMG DSCM members record the results of this research in the
        narratives feature of DSCM AT. DSCM members also follow up on actions from
        previous supportability analysis cycles. DSCM members communicate updates to
        applicable End Item PMs or LMSs who then collaborate with appropriate IMs or
        ESs to resolve new or changed issues.
        5.8.1.1.6.8. SSs review how demand plans compare to requirements. In cases of
        discrepancy, DLA SSs contacts the DLA ISA demand planners to coordinate on
        any variances or forecasting issues. Demand planners also communicate with
        process initiators and logisticians.
        5.8.1.1.6.9. SSs analyze demand plan supportability and research reasons of non-
        supportability. If causes are not apparent through the data displayed in DSCM
        AT, SSs communicate with the applicable AF DSCM IPT members, DLA internal
        sources, and suppliers that can provide further information to gain the necessary
        insight to correct and resolve issues.
        5.8.1.1.6.10. SSs document results of research in DSCM AT and follow up on
        actions from previous supportability analysis cycles. 448 SCMW DSCM team
        members, DLA CSMs, and end-item PMs or LMSs access information from
        DSCM AT and follow up with SSs as required. SSs communicate updates to
AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                             23


          applicable 448 SCMW DSCM team members and end-item PMs or LMSs.
          5.8.1.1.6.11. DSCM IPT Planners’ verify bill of material (BOM) coding, and
          configuration accuracy. DSCM IPT Planners research and review BOMs of non-
          supportable items and items flagged by PMs or LMSs. Updates to BOMs are
          communicated to RCC Planners and resource control centers (RCCs). RCC
          Planners reconcile replacement factors with historical data from Maintenance
          Repair and Overhaul (MRO) systems. If the actual usage factors are greater or
          less than the BOM replacement factors, DSCM IPT Planners contact owning RCC
          Planners to recommend changes to factors. RCC Planners notify process initiators
          to initiate appropriate DDE procedures.
          5.8.1.1.6.12. The DSCM IPT Planner verifies the Acquisition Advice Code
          (AAC), verifying that ‘V’ or ‘Y’ coded items have an identified replacement
          NSN. These are items that are being phased out and should have a replacement
          part lined up. If this replacement is not sufficient, they contact the ES for
          reconciliation.
          5.8.1.1.6.13. The DSCM IPT Planner validates the Quantity per Assembly or
          Application (QPA) and part numbers using the Tech Order (TO). The DSCM IPT
          Planner also examines the Interchangeability & Substitutability (I&S)
          relationships and their impact on supportability. Items with a QPA of zero listed
          in DSCM AT require scrutiny. If the correct value is not zero, the DSCM IPT
          Planner contacts the RCC Planner to correct the value in the applicable source
          systems. Additionally, QPA zero values may not have provided the proper
          demand signal to DLA. To address this, the DSCM IPT Planner checks if DDEs
          are in place due to this error. If not, the DSCM IPT Planner contacts the proper
          Process Initiator (PI) to begin DDE process with the PDMC, assuming they are a
          PDMC process initiator (PI); if not, the depot forecasting specialist makes the
          input.
          5.8.1.1.6.14. Acting as a general liaison to the Maintenance Complex, the DSCM
          IPT Planner also gathers and communicates any known maintenance process
          changes (e.g. lean events, shop moves), schedule changes, or supportability
          factors that could impact out-quarter production to the DSCM IPT.
       5.8.1.1.7. Step 2 – Develop Countermeasures and Action Plans*.
          5.8.1.1.7.1. Developing the countermeasures and action plans to resolve future
          supportability issues are a key activity within the DSCM IPT. It requires
          collaboration of the DSCM IPT with PM/LMSs, IMs, RCC Planners, SSs, and
          potentially engineering to develop solutions for the supply chain. In essence, the
          discussion and collaboration merely starts at solving the immediate issue. The
          cooperation continues to develop a get-well Operating Plan that aligns issue
          resolution (e.g. expected part deliveries in a certain month) with the alignment of
          the repair, demand and buy plans to reflect the issue resolution and to catch up on
          production that may have caused excessive end item backorders or Awaiting Parts
          (AWP).
              5.8.1.1.7.1.1. Once the team documents the countermeasures and action
 24                                                   AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014


                 plans, along with any associated risks in DSCM AT, the PM/LMS, DSCM
                 IPT member (working the item), and RCC Planner must sign off on the
                 revised plan to ensure accountability; then the countermeasures become part
                 of the end item’s Operating Plan*.
                 5.8.1.1.7.1.2. The DSCM IPT Planner coordinates unresolved supportability
                 issues with the RCC Planner for additional countermeasures and action plans,
                 provides feedback on the Operating Plan, and shares alternative solutions*.
                 5.8.1.1.7.1.3. Any issue the team cannot resolve or requires further authority
                 to take action is elevated to the DSCM IPT Chief and DLA Aviation Planning
                 & Support Chief for discussion, resolution, authorization, or submission to the
                 IPEx SP Nomination Process for further supportability analysis and resolution
                 by the FSG/ESC.
          5.8.1.1.8. Step 3 – Collaborative Operating Plans*.
             5.8.1.1.8.1. The results of the supportability analysis are documented and
             presented to leadership via the Strategic Supportability Plan (SSP*) by the DSCM
             Leads. SSPs are used to review and improve operating plans, the execution of
             which are ultimately the responsibility of PMs or LMSs. Operating plans include
             repair and purchase requirements, contractor repair requirements, and projections
             of inventory levels for a minimum of 24 months.
                 5.8.1.1.8.1.1. The Operating Plan will represent how demand will be satisfied
                 over the 24-month minimum planning horizon as well as a 12-month history
                 of displayed data points.
          5.8.1.1.9. Non-Supportable Report (NSR).
             5.8.1.1.9.1. NSRs provide views of non-supportable end items. IPTs research
             causes and propose solutions to address non-supportable items. End items are not
             considered to have been worked by the system until each IPT member has
             addressed his or her respective, component-level concerns.
          5.8.1.1.10. Level 2: FSG Resolution.
             5.8.1.1.10.1. The first supportability path of the nomination process described
             below is Level 2: FSG Resolution. This path provides an avenue for non-
             supportable end items suffering from non-parts-related issues to be presented to
             the FSG by the end-item PM or LMS for resolution through the IPEx SP
             governance structure. The product of Level 2 FSG resolution efforts is a revised
             operating plan.
          5.8.1.1.11. Nomination Process*

                 5.8.1.1.11.1. The IPEx SP Nomination Process allows FSG to prioritize the least-
                 supportable items in the supply chain for Level 2-3 resolution. The local DSCM
                 Chief will facilitate this process by collecting a list of non-supportable items each
                 quarter through call for topics and DSCM IPT Nominations data requests.
                 5.8.1.1.11.2. The Weighted Criteria End Item Listing* is a measure of the health
                 of an end item based on the following criteria.

                   5.8.1.1.11.4. The higher the score indicates a less supportable item.
                   5.8.1.1.11.5. The DSCM IPT will validate the list with the PM/LMS to ensure the
                   end items identified are in need of FSG attention or possibly a Deep Look if
                   FSG/ESC is unable to resolve.
                   5.8.1.1.11.6. Once the DSCM Chief has collected the call for topics from
                   Squadron and Planning & Support Leadership for items/issues requiring special
                   attention, each of those items will be validated with the PM/LMS. Occasionally, it
                   is anticipated the data may be incomplete or otherwise corrupt at one point along
                   the path. If it is concluded the data was incorrect, the end item is excluded from
                   Level 2/3 analysis and resolution until corrections are made and the non-
                   supportability condition is corrected. The PM/LMS is responsible for managing
                   activities with the appropriate agency required to make the correction. The act of
                   correcting the data is considered a countermeasure.
                   5.8.1.1.11.7. After refinement, the DSCM Chief will analyze the list to identify
                   which end items are candidates for elevation to FSG Resolution, a Deep Look, or
                   prioritized to the DSCM IPT.
                5.8.1.1.12. Level 3: Deep Look.
                   5.8.1.1.12.1. The Deep Look Center is established to analyze end items with parts
                   supportability issues. Deep Look is an extensive look at the material
                   supportability of a particular end item production number through careful analysis
                   of supply chain aspects including the BOM, repair requirements, Cataloging Data
                   (Supply Signal and Supply Management Codes), Weapons System Coding,
                   Supportability Posture, Stock Positioning, Demand Planning, Procurement
                   (Contracts and/or Purchase Requests) and Industrial Prime Vendor (IPV) and
                   Forecast Accuracy.
                   5.8.1.1.12.2. The Deep Look process is organized into four standardized,
                   sequential steps to schedule, prepare, conduct the event, and to close out the
                   event. It is important to note Deep Look is a method for identifying supportability
                   constraints and does not, in and of its self, lead to immediate root cause
AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                             27


          identification or improve the health of supportability. Deep Look success is
          achieved through collaboration, countermeasure execution, and leveraging lessons
          learned.
       5.8.1.1.13. Critical Success Factors.
          5.8.1.1.13.1. Deep Look success is contingent on three critical success factors:
          collaboration, countermeasure execution, and leveraging lessons learned.
              5.8.1.1.13.1.1. Collaboration: During Deep Looks team members (the day to
              day SME) are able to communicate about specifics associated to the end item
              and piece parts. Supports an improved understanding of the unique challenges
              each job role faces with providing support and understanding of interactive
              dependencies. The Deep Look Center is a unique forum. As a result of a Deep
              Look participants gain an understanding of job roles both within and outside
              of their organization. Deep Look teams require empowered SMEs.
              5.8.1.1.13.1.2. Countermeasure Execution: The Deep Look event will
              generate countermeasures and action items to be accomplished during the
              event where possible, and taken for follow-up action when necessary.
              5.8.1.1.13.1.3. Lessons Learned: A Lesson Learned is an observation with
              validated resolution that results in improved operations at the strategic,
              operational or tactical level. Deep Look lessons learned are derived primarily
              through data analysis.
                5.8.1.1.13.1.3.1. During the event, data is collected and when summarized
                provides a view into trends associated to an end item. When combined with
                summaries from other deep looks paint a picture of larger systemic issues
                observed across all workloads and complexes.
                5.8.1.1.13.1.3.2. Data driven findings are not the only lessons learned, non-
                data findings are just as important and significant as the data observed
                findings and need to also be reported to the FSG.
          5.8.1.1.13.2. Deep Looks can uncover causality for the lessons learned, but
          cannot always determine the root cause. The FSG is responsible to manage the
          evaluation of the actionable data, determine the appropriate method to address,
          and administer the deployment and implementation of corrective actions; i.e.
          continuous process improvement tools, policy, training, etc.
       5.8.1.1.14. Four Step Deep Look Process.
          5.8.1.1.14.1. Deep Look is organized into four sequential processes depicted in
          Figure 5.3. Every end item will follow the Four Step Deep Look Process.
              5.8.1.1.14.1.1. Step 1 – Pre-Deep Look Activities.
              5.8.1.1.14.1.2. Step 2 – Deep Look Event.
              5.8.1.1.14.1.3. Step 3 – Post-Deep Look Activities.
              5.8.1.1.14.1.4. Step 4 – FSG Meeting for out briefs and Lessons Leaned
              (Deep Look Outcomes).

Figure 5.3. Four Step Deep Look Process




             5.8.1.1.14.2. This section of the process guide will step through each major
             process as it occurs sequentially.
             5.8.1.1.14.3. The End Item PM/LMS’s and the DLA CSM’s roles throughout the
             entirety of the Deep Look process cannot be overemphasized. The PM/LMS and
             CSM are accountable for their end item through the end-to-end process.
         5.8.1.1.15. Step 1 – Pre-Deep Look Activities.
             5.8.1.1.15.1. Pre-Deep Look Activities occur after the end item is nominated,
             prioritized and approved by the FSG and coordinated with the ESC. All pre-Deep
             Look activities are used to prepare for the actual Deep Look Event to ensure
             information and resources are available and prepared to be productive during the
             event. The End Item PM/LMS works closely with the Deep Look PM throughout
             Pre-Deep Look Activities to ensure information is available.
             5.8.1.1.15.2. Team Identification: The Deep Look PM will disseminate a data call
             for team members to the applicable FSG members, ensuring attendance to the
             event, on-site, as scheduled, and expertise reach-back points of contact (POCs).
             The DL PM coordinates with the applicable FSG members to obtain SME
             participation. Some of the roles identified below may not be required depending
             on the circumstances of the end item. This determination will be at the discretion
             of the DL PM.
                5.8.1.1.15.2.1. Deep Look Participation Team: These are the team members
                who are expected to participate, either in person at the Deep Look Center
                (DLC) or via existing communication/video technology, for the duration of
                the event to lend expertise and make decisions on behalf of their
                organizations. The following individuals should be identified and their contact
                information submitted to the DLC PM: End Item PM or LMS (AFLCMC
                Program Offices/SCMG), Item Manager (SCMG), Engineer (AFLCMC or
                AFNWC Program Offices/SCMG), Equipment Specialist (AFLCMC Program
                Offices/SCMG), Master Scheduler (MX), RCC Planner (MX), Mechanic
                (MX), Sustainment Specialist (SS) (DLA), Customer Support Specialist (CSS)
                (DLA), DLA Demand Planner (DLA), Customer Support Manager (CSM) as
                needed, (DLA), Production Support Technician (PST) as needed and IPV
                Supportability Analyst as needed.
                5.8.1.1.15.2.2. These positions represent those positions common to all three
                ALCs. If individual ALCs have additional positions peculiar to their
                organizations, the DL PMs should extend site-specific team invitations as
                appropriate.
             5.8.1.1.15.3. Obtain Bill of Material (BOM): The DLC staff will request the RCC
AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                              29


          Planner to furnish the full repair BOM to the DL PM as soon as possible once an
          end item has obtained approval for a Deep Look Event. The Depot Maintenance
          Material Support System (G005M) BOM should be used whenever possible. It is
          the Air Force’s responsibility to identify all items used for an end item to include
          non-stock listed and IPV/indirect material even if it is not included in the
          provided BOM. The Deep Look PM will calculate the duration of the event based
          on the size of the BOM. Estimated duration of the event: Rule of Thumb: Allow
          one week for every 130 line items on the BOM, e.g. 130 items = 1-week, 260
          items = 2-weeks.
          5.8.1.1.15.4. Scheduling. With the FSG approval, the DL PM will add end items
          to the queue for scheduling. Scheduling is accomplished with consideration given
          to the following factors:
          5.8.1.1.15.5. DLC facilities availability: DL events are time consuming and
          facilities are limited.
          5.8.1.1.15.6. PM and key player availability: Deep Look Facilitator, Equipment
          Specialist, Engineer, Mechanic, RCC Planner, End Item PM or LMS, and DLA
          CSM availability are the driving scheduling factors.
          5.8.1.1.15.7. Operating Plan Data Call: The End Item PM or LMS will deliver the
          applicable end-item operating plan to the Deep Look PM. The operating plan* is
          informed by the deep look process through updates and changes to source
          systems. The operating plan provides baseline measurements of supportability of
          the supply chain* and will be reviewed six months after the event to assess if
          supportability has changed. Until operating plans are finalized, baseline data is
          provided to the DL PM. The baseline data includes end item requirements, A-
          condition asset inventory, F-condition asset inventory, back-order data, AWP
          data, and current and planned production.
          5.8.1.1.15.8. Demand Consensus Meeting: The DLC PM will host this meeting,
          led by the DLA Demand Planner, and attended by the End Item PM or LMS, the
          DLA CSM, master or regular scheduler, and other team members as required
          depending upon the circumstances surrounding the cause/reason for deep look
          selection. The DL PM will provide a copy of the BOM to the DLA Demand
          Planner at least 3 days in advance of the meeting to allow them to conduct the
          necessary analysis using DSCM AT, as well as other tools such as the Depot
          Analysis Recap Reset Tool (DARRT) report and the Department of Defense -
          Electronic Mall (DOD EMALL) Supportability Analysis Stock Out Report
          (SASOR); evaluating current and projected supportability concerns to identify the
          “longest pole in the tent” for critical path planning. Additionally, they will pull
          the demand plan accuracy for the same BOM. The Air Force will bring any
          supportability challenges associated to AF managed parts to include carcass. The
          meeting will review the current Operating Plan* to confirm or change the
          requirement and to agree on the future end item production schedule as the
          baseline for decisions and countermeasures to be developed during the Deep Look
          Event.
          5.8.1.1.15.9. Roles and Responsibilities Meeting: May be held in conjunction
30                                              AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014


        with the Demand Consensus Meeting and is conducted at the Deep Look Center.
        All identified SMEs (see Team Identification) will be present for this event.
        Participants are briefed on their specific responsibilities for the event (see
        Attachment 8). Additionally, each participant will access their primary system
        databases and information system programs from their assigned workstations
        inside the Deep Look Center to verify the necessary access to fulfill their
        responsibilities and conduct necessary searches during the event. Action Items
        will be taken to address any system access issues.
     5.8.1.1.16. Step 2 – Deep Look Event.
        5.8.1.1.16.1. The outcome of the Deep Look is a complete material sustainment
        package for the PDN, updated files and records maintenance, an approved input
        back into the source systems, and a baseline from which to measure future
        performance against the PDN. All factors involved in sustainment analysis are
        reviewed for accuracy. This includes catalog data, sustainment posture, demand
        history, and stock positioning.
        5.8.1.1.16.2. Deep Look Spreadsheet: The Deep Look Spreadsheet is a tool used
        to facilitate discussion and collaboration of the Deep Look Team and is a living
        document. The DLC facilitator will walk the Deep Look team through the data
        points as they apply to the end item and individual component parts encouraging
        discussion for understanding, identify data point errors and work together to
        capture discrepancies, causes and action plans to resolve contributing factors to
        the non-supportability condition. The following sub-paragraphs highlight areas of
        emphasis.
        5.8.1.1.16.3. Part-by-part scrub: Is a careful analysis of the designated BOM and
        supportability. This examination addresses the requirement as determined by the
        PM or LMS, the D200A computation, or the Weapon System Program Office. All
        factors involved in the sustainment determination are reviewed for accuracy,
        including cataloging data, sustainment posture, and stock positioning.
            5.8.1.1.16.3.1. Gaps are identified during the part-by-part scrub and may
            include gaps between repair requirement and maintenance production plan,
            DLA stock on hand and forecast demand, or expected-replacement percentage
            and actual-replacement percentage. Other issues may include supply
            discipline or communication breakdowns.
            5.8.1.1.16.3.2. Determine cause: Evaluation of gap to determine cause and/or
            root cause when possible, versus symptoms (i.e. material is not available when
            needed is the symptom the cause is missing demand signals due to unknown
            demand-history adjustment process).
        5.8.1.1.16.4. Execute fixes: Education and information are provided to
        understand the supply chain process, interactions, and the implications of their
        decisions with respect to sustainment. Systems of record are changed as needed
        (i.e. override demand plan, change G005M replacement percentage). Some
        changes are initiated in the room with completion of action occurring outside of
        the Deep Look Center (i.e. D143 cataloging change requests). Other changes
AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                             31


          cannot be initiated until completion of the deep look (i.e. Technical Order updates
          and offset buys); these become open action items (see chapter 7 Accountability).
          5.8.1.1.16.5. Identify systemic issues leading to policy changes: Findings from
          the deep look efforts are captured by the DLC facilitator, analyzed, and presented
          to the FSG. FSG will then evaluate and assess the resolution needed to address the
          issue or table it pending additional findings. FSG will recommend endorsement
          from the ESC for policy changes as needed.
          5.8.1.1.16.6. Deep Look Rules of Engagement (ROE): Expectation management
          is fundamental to ensuring efficient use of the time and resources invested in a
          Deep Look event. The following ROE will be observed:
              5.8.1.1.16.6.1. FSG/ESC: The ESC and FSG will promote and support the
              DL process by supporting participation through active involvement in de-
              conflicting schedules, i.e. cancelling training commitments, excusing
              participants from previously scheduled meetings, etc. They will be advocates
              and ambassadors for the DL by recognizing success of the participants,
              removing roadblocks, and advocating the institutionalization of lessons
              learned to ensure they are shared across the Enterprise.
              5.8.1.1.16.6.2. Deep Look Participants: They will report to the DL event on
              time and be prepared to participate. They will not allow interruptions to their
              participation without valid reason and working it out with their respective
              FSG member, in conjunction with the DLC PM. They will fulfill their role
              and contribute to the success of the process. They will represent their
              organization by actively participating in a positive manner. They will actively
              engage in the process and complete their action items on time. They will de-
              conflict their calendar by engaging management to remove roadblocks to
              ensure participation.
              5.8.1.1.16.6.3. DLC PM and Facilitator: The DLC Staff fulfill a facilitation
              role and will challenge the SMEs to ensure the data collected is accurate.
              However, they will remain neutral to the interpretation of data, identifying
              causes, and countermeasures. They will notify the FSG when issues arise
              during the course of the event. They will represent the Deep Look process by
              actively participating in a positive manner.
       5.8.1.1.17. Step 3 – Post-Deep Look Activities.
          5.8.1.1.17.1. Upon successful completion of the Deep Look Event, the Deep
          Look team work closely to manage Post-Deep Look Activities. Immediate
          activities include action-item management, and preparation and delivery of initial
          out briefs of deep look events.
          5.8.1.1.17.2. Action items Management: Fixed accountability is a key component
          of the IPEx SP Model. As such, the DLC Facilitator captures, documents, and
          assigns action items during the Deep Look they are assigned to the appropriate
          participant based on their role. Action item execution is crucial to the success of
          the Deep Look Event. The expectation is that any action items that cannot be
          closed during the event be completed within one month of receiving the action
32                                             AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014


     item listing from the DLC Facilitator; the exception is for cataloging actions
     which must be initiated within the timeframe. SMEs must provide specific actions
     taken to complete the required action. The DLC team is responsible for
     maintaining the action item repository. An accounting of action item progress will
     be included in the Deep Look Initial Out brief and Final Out brief conducted
     approximately six months following the completion of the event. If an action item
     is given to make changes or address projected supportability/forecasting issues
     and the answer still results as the same, then elevation of that action item will be
     given to the FSG for resolution. Example is requested to accelerate deliveries to
     prevent projected outage and after confirmation from procurement the deliveries
     cannot be accelerated, do not close the open action item, elevate it to the FSG for
     resolution.
     5.8.1.1.17.3. Deep Look Initial Out brief: The initial out brief ensures
     accountability and stewardship of the resources expended while providing a
     snapshot of all activities to-date, identification of causes, and action items planned
     to resolve non-supportability issues. The DLC PM will develop the initial out
     brief with inputs as needed from the team.
     5.8.1.1.17.4. The initial out brief will include the following topics:
        5.8.1.1.17.4.1. Deep Look summary data provided by the DLC PM (This
        information is obtained from the DLC spreadsheet).
        5.8.1.1.17.4.2. Distribution of findings provided by the DLC PM (This
        information is obtained from the DLC spreadsheet).
        5.8.1.1.17.4.3. Additional/Non-data findings provided by the DLC PM (This
        information is obtained from the DLC spreadsheet).
     5.8.1.1.17.5. Operating Plan* before:
        5.8.1.1.17.5.1. Purple Mountain chart (before Deep Look) is provided by
        SCMG PM or LMS and MX Master Scheduler and given to Deep Look
        Participants during pre-Deep Look activities.
        5.8.1.1.17.5.2. Demand Planning Scorecard (before Deep Look) provided by
        the DLA Planning and Support, CSM, collaborating with the DLA Demand
        Planner, SS, and Data Analysts and provided to Deep Look participants
        during Deep Look activities.
        5.8.1.1.17.5.3. Stock posture (before Deep Look) provided by DLA Data
        Analysts.
        5.8.1.1.17.5.4. Demand consensus (before Deep Look) provided by the DLC
        PM (This information is captured from the SMEs during the pre-Deep Look
        Demand Consensus Meeting).
        5.8.1.1.17.5.5. End item gap summary provided by the DLC PM (This
        information is obtained from the DLC spreadsheet).
        5.8.1.1.17.5.6. The initial out brief will be completed no later than two weeks
        following the conclusion of the Deep Look event. The initial out brief will be
AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                           33


             distributed to the Deep Look team, FSG and ESC. (Attachment 10, Initial Out
             brief).
       5.8.1.1.18. Step 4 – Deep Look Outcomes:
          5.8.1.1.18.1. The outcome of the Deep Look is a complete material sustainment
          package for the PDN, updated files and records maintenance, an approved input
          back into the source systems (updates to the Operating Plan*), and a baseline
          from which to measure future performance against the PDN.
          5.8.1.1.18.2. Follow-up Demand Consensus Meeting: This meeting is similar to
          the Demand Consensus Meeting conducted during pre-Deep Look activities
          (Attachment 8). It will be scheduled 60-90 days following action item closure.
          Particularly important are those actions assigned to BOM, process initiator and
          demand planning. The participants will review Deep Look data (as needed), pre-
          demand consensus meeting observations, and the revised Operating Plan. The
          participants will achieve consensus for the end item requirements and make
          updates to demand and Operating Plan as necessary to ensure planning to the
          critical path.
          5.8.1.1.18.3. Deep Look Final Out brief: Approximately six months following the
          Deep Look, the DLC PM will initiate the improvement validation phase of the
          IPEx SP. The End Item PM or LMS will pull the improved Operating Plan to be
          compared to the pre-Deep Look Operating Plan. It must be understood there may
          be a number of variables in the production environment, changes to requirements
          or other initiatives contributing to end item health. Therefore, we cannot tie
          changes (improvements or decline) to the supportability health exclusively to the
          Deep Look event. The DLC PM will then create the final out brief with inputs as
          needed from the team (Attachment 11). If the Get Well date of the end item is
          more than six months from Deep Look event completion, the local FSG will
          evaluate whether additional periodic updates are required to allow the FSG to

     5.8.1.1.19. Countermeasures*:
        5.8.1.1.19.1. Countermeasures are actions taken to change a non-supportable
        condition. The collaborative characteristic of IPEx SP at all levels enables the
        best countermeasures to be developed. Countermeasures are an output of the
        IPEx SP process. DSCM AT provides a mechanism to collect
        countermeasures for accountability and sharing. Acknowledgement and
        approval of the countermeasures are listed below.
          5.8.1.1.19.1.1. Level 1, SCMG Squadron Level & Level 2, and DSCM IPT

                                           Chapter 6

                                     OPERATING PLAN

6.1. Operating plans serve as accountability and execution vehicles to communicate among
supply chain stakeholders and senior leaders. They are designed to enhance and ensure parts
supportability for depot operations. Operating plans are products of requirements forecasting and
supportability analysis (Figure 6.1.). Operating plans reflect quantitative information including
planned repairs, buys, deliveries, inventory levels, and countermeasures developed during
supportability analysis and resolution (Chapter 5). Operating plans and get-well plans become
agreements for making non-supportable items supportable. After establishing, improving, or
updating operating plans, new plans must be communicated to all stakeholders.

Figure 6.1. IPEx SP Main Categories




   6.1.1. Operating plans include analysis of forecast demand and associated requirements over
   a minimum 24-month, rolling horizon. Operating plans also provide rolling 12-month
   historical views for performance assessment. Operating plans include input from all
   stakeholders. For Production Numbers (PDNs) identified red in DSCM AT, DSCM IPTs
   work to resolve supportability issues. If PDN supportability issues cannot be resolved within
   a DSCM IPT, the IPT reaches out to PMs, or LMSs. PMs or LMSs convene teams to
   determine workarounds and develop alternate solutions to adapt the operating plan. PMs or
   LMSs convene teams to determine workarounds and develop alternate solutions to adapt the
   operating plan. In accordance with applicable regulations (including AFMCI 21-101 Depot
   Maintenance Activation Planning, AFMCI 21-102 Analytical Condition Inspection (ACI)
   Programs), PMs or LMSs convene teams to determine workarounds and develop alternate
   solutions to adapt the operating plan. PMs or LMSs provide revised operating plans to
   DSCM IPTs and brief appropriate maintenance (MX) and supply chain groups. Operating
   plans developed in Deep Looks and IPTs undergo review in FSG and in ESC meetings.
   6.1.2. Operating Plans are available through DSCM AT to stakeholders*. Please note that
   asterisks (*) indicate elements to be established before Full Operating Capability (FOC).
6.2. There are four main components of operating plans (Figure 6 2).
   6.2.1. End Item Supportability confirms that forecast end items and aircraft (AC) task
   requirements will be satisfied with current parts inventory, operating plans, and pipelines.
   6.2.2. Piece-Part Supportability provides drill-downs showing piece parts of end items.
   6.2.3. Action Plans & Risk Assessments provide coordinated lists of anticipated risks and
   needed actions to achieve supportability.
AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                               37


   6.2.4. Performance Metrics help provide accountability to action plans and include end-item
   and piece-part supportability*.

Figure 6.2. The Four Components of an Operating Plan




   6.2.5. The Requirements Forecasting and Supportability Analysis phase of IPEx SP provides
   data for the first three components of operating plans and comes from DSCM AT. The final
   component of operating plans is performance metrics. Performance metrics enable senior
   leadership to enforce accountability to operating plans.
   6.2.6. These four components provide End Item PMs or LMSs with complete views of how
   end items will perform over a minimum of 24 months.
6.3. Executing Operating Plans in IPEx SP.
   6.3.1. Operating plans provide common threads for collaboration through supportability,
   analysis, and resolution processes. Decisions, actions, and plans are based on collaborative
   views and documentation captured in operating plans. Operating plans also capture new
   decisions, actions, and plan adjustments.
6.4. Using Operating Plans to Determine Supportability Paths.
   6.4.1. Operating Plans are available through DSCM AT* and contribute to finding
   supportability paths. DSCM AT highlights the severity of end-item supportability issues.
   This allows PMs and LMSs to review specific end items and determine whether they can find
   resolutions or need further support.
6.5. Using the Operating Plan to Resolve Issues.
   6.5.1. When resolving parts supportability issues, operating plans enable collaboration and
   communication among supply chain partners by providing common information,
   documentation, and goals.
   6.5.2. Operating plans are pivotal agreements for all activities to resolve supportability
   issues. There are four operating-plan aspects explained in this section.
       6.5.2.1. What-If Scenarios*.
       6.5.2.2. Repair & Buy Plan Collaboration.
       6.5.2.3. Inventory Analysis.
       6.5.2.4. Supplier Forecast Alignment*.
 38                                                    AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014


   6.5.3. What-If Scenarios*.
       6.5.3.1. DSCM AT allows users to create what-if scenarios to aid in operating plan
       development. This allows performance of supportability analysis to ensure that piece
       parts will continue to support proposed requirements. Operating plans contain repair
       requirements, buys, stock levels, anticipated risks, proposed actions, and
       countermeasures. In cases of increased repair demand, stakeholders will determine if
       current operating plans will support the increase in demand. Stakeholders will create get-
       well plans if necessary. Stakeholders route new operating plans through appropriate
       chains of command for approval.
          6.5.3.1.1. Using operating plans as central communication vehicles provides holistic
          views of – and approaches to – supportability issues. Through collaboration, efforts to
          solve supportability issues become synchronized and balanced.
   6.5.4. Inventory Analysis*.
       6.5.4.1. DSCM AT compares asset availability against thresholds provided by legacy
       systems, calculates optimal supply levels, and identifies inappropriate levels – either too
       low or too high.
       6.5.4.2. Systemic issues, lessons learned, and best practices will be applied across the
       enterprise to avoid repeating the errors and process breakdowns that lead to insufficient
       or excess materiel, not necessarily the outright elimination of excess inventory.
   6.5.5. Supplier Forecast Alignment*.
       6.5.5.1. Operating plans provide demand signals to upstream processes and suppliers.
       Operating plans forecast piece-part need based on planned repairs for a given period. The
       quality of this demand assessment depends on demand forecast accuracy, repair plan
       adherence, and accurate and reliable data.
       6.5.5.2. For a variety of reasons, suppliers may not consider planned repair data when
       creating their plans for providing piece parts. Through other means, such as statistical
       forecasting based on historical demand values, suppliers develop plans to meet
       anticipated piece-part needs.
       6.5.5.3. Because many suppliers do not use enterprise-furnished operating plans to
       develop their forecasts, enterprise stakeholders must compare and align supplier forecasts
       with enterprise operating plans.
       6.5.5.4. DLA Sustainment Specialists (SSs) compare piece-part requirements to DLA
       forecasts to identify gaps or other issues. SSs refer items to DLA demand planners to
       address discrepancies. PMs and LMSs compare piece-part requirements to vendor
       forecasts when this information is available.
6.6. Operating Plans as Accountability Vehicles. Through execution, alignment, and
monitoring, operating plans serve as accountability vehicles. Operating plans are collaborative
agreements on how to support end items. Accountability is covered in Chapter 7.
AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014                                                                 39


                                          Chapter 7

                                ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS

7.1. IPEx SP performance metrics concern processes related to the plan-element of the
sustainment chain. While DSCM teams are accountable for executing operating plans, the
plans themselves and the contained metrics are reported up chains of command that monitor the
performance of teams, operating plans, and the overall supply chain. Operating plans serve as
vehicles for accountability and execution among all sustainment-chain stakeholders and senior
executives.
   7.1.1. IPEx SP provides a fact-based, collaborative approach to supply chain planning and
   execution. It offers standardized processes and robust tools to synchronize end-item
   requirements and maintenance execution while ensuring accountability through governance.
7.2. Supportability Planning Metrics.
   7.2.1. Supportability metrics encompass a number of sub-processes designed to help identify
   and resolve supportability issues that the PM or LMS might encounter. The functions
   addressed by the sub-processes are captured below. The first three are high-level planning
   metrics that roll up from daily standard work. The final two are focused on supportability at
   the end-item level.
       7.2.1.1. Buy Planning.
       7.2.1.2. Repair Planning.
       7.2.1.3. Inventory Planning.
       7.2.1.4. DSCM IPT Future Supportability.
       7.2.1.5. Deep Look Future Supportability.
   7.2.2. Operating Plan Metrics.
       7.2.2.1. Operating Plans are mechanism used to facilitate the execution of IPEx SP.
       Operating plans have procedures to identify performance levels for buys, repairs and
       inventory as well as historical and forecast demand levels. In general, reviews of
       operating plans should occur in concert with updates to planning or execution data in
       DSCM AT. The most common review periods will be monthly as actual data is received.
       7.2.2.2. Accuracy and adherence metrics indicate the percentage of time that the forecast
       value for a given metric matched the actual execution value. The inventory days of
       supply metric indicates the number of days of repair requirement that can be supported
       based on the current inventory. Supplier forecast alignment is the comparison of IPEx-
       SP-generated piece-part requirement forecast to suppliers’ self-generated forecasts of the
       Air Force requirement based on Air Force demand history.
       7.2.2.3. Users of operating plan metrics include all sustainment-chain partners in IPEx
       SP. These partners include PMs or LMSs, SCMG, Program Offices or ASDs, MX, DLA,
       FSG, and ESC.
   7.2.3. Supportability Metrics.
 40                                                   AFSCMAN20-101 21 JANUARY 2014


       7.2.3.1. The PMs or LMSs will use the performance measures in DSCM AT on a
       monthly basis to review operating plans and collaborate with their sustainment-chain
       partners to develop support solutions for end items.
          7.2.3.1.1. Flights will use the operating plan metrics to flag issues or patterns that
          span multiple items and would be outside the scope of what a single PM or LMS
          would review.
          7.2.3.1.2. Squadrons will use DSCM AT to assess performance-to-plan and
          determine impacts on and by squadron-level and larger-group initiatives.
          7.2.3.1.3. Groups will use the supportability measures to assess the accuracy of high-
          level planning measures and to guide the coordination of corrective actions brought
          through the elevation process.
   7.2.4. Other Measures*.

                             End Item Lessons Learned
Lessons learned are the insights that can be captured as a result of activities that yield a positive or negative result.
They can be developed through solving a root cause, piloting a proposed solution, testing a new process, etc. The
following template should be populated once a lesson learned or best practice is identified and it can be shared
across end items, stakeholders, organizations, etc.

                                                    Definitions
End Item: name of the end item that the lesson learned or best practice was identified on (Example – Antenna)
Weapon System: name of the weapon system that the End Item is a c omponent of (Example – F-16)
Project Name: name of the project that the lesson learned or best practice was identified during. This field will
should be descriptive and contain descriptive words so that it can easily be searched (Example – F-16 end item
requirements determination and consolidation)
End Item Program Manager: name of the projec t manager (Example - Jeff Smith)

Problem Statement: description of the issue that was occurring and driving poor performance (Example - end item
requirements were understated due to Not Repairable To Station (NRTS) requirements not properly being
captured)
Root Cause(s): describes the root causes that were creating the stated problem (Example – inaccurate processes
(and subsequent policy(s)) were leading to the inability to capture the full end item requirement)
Countermeasure: describes the actions taken to alleviate the root cause. These countermeasures should be used
by other project teams to alleviate the same problem occurring on their project teams. (Example – worked with
stakeholders to document the current process gaps, map a new process to capture their complete requirement
through the use of system ABC, and documented new process in daily work)
Policy Implications: states any changes to policy or daily work that were a result of countermeasure implementation
(Example - Changes to AFMAN XX-XXX were made to ensure all end item requirements were captured through the
use of System ABC)
Efficiencies gained: helps doc ument the effic ienc ies / benefits gained from implementing the
c ountermeasure. Below is a list of examples that illustrate the antic ipated response to eac h of these
sec tions
Financial Efficiencies: effic ienc ies that drive bottom line savings
Organizational Efficiencies: effic ienc ies gained in organizational struc ture or the workforc e
Information Technology Efficiencies: effic ienc ies in the elimination or sync hronization of systems, tools,
etc .
Operational Efficiencies: effic ienc ies that drive direc t improvements to c ustomer support

Key:
R Responsible: Performing the work to achieve the task.
A Accountable: The one ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and the one from whom
Responsible is delegated the work. In other words, an Accountable must sigh off (Approve) on work that Responsible provides.
C Consulted: Those whose opinions are sought, typically subject matter experts; and with whom there is two-way communication.
I Informed: Those who are kept up-to-date on progress, often only on completion of the task or deliverable; and with whom there is just one-
way communication.

Red                Pre-mitigated: Insufficient Stock on Hand (SOH) + Purchase Order (PO) (won’t
                   meet demand date, inside Administrative Lead Time (ALT)+ Production Lead
                   Time (PLT)).

                   --Acquisition Advice Code (AAC) H item with Backorder or ALT > 45 days

                   Post-mitigated: Work around is required but not identified or available.
                   Unmitigated short-to-need

Orange             Pre-mitigated: Insufficient SOH+PO (won’t meet demand date), outside

                   Post-mitigated: -- Roll to green for reporting

                   No Change (not option for Status)

Yellow             Pre-mitigated: SOH+PO+PR are sufficient to meet forecasted demand

                   Post-mitigated:

                   -- Work around is available & production should take place as required

                   -- New contract will be awarded to cover demand

                   --- Specific contractual (i.e. AAC H, Direct Vendor Deliver (DVD) contract) or
                   other work around will be in place to ensure demand should be satisfied

                   -- F Condition Assets on-hand >= demand with lead time short enough to cover
                   requirement date

Green              Pre-mitigated: SOH + Contracts Due-In (PO) + Non-Red DSCM reparable
                   delivery schedule (i.e. M, F, Z, Y Cond and Shop Flow Days) + contract repairs
                   are sufficient to cover required need date.

                   --AAC H or L item with No Backorder or ALT < 45 days

                   Post-mitigated:

                   -- Can be turned “Green” if un-captured systemic information caused false color
                   or contract is awarded to cover demand

Brown         Pre-mitigated: 0 QPA or replacement factor of 0%. If any of these values
              changes, DSCM AT flags the change so a procurement strategy can be
              determined. In this case, the PM/LMS & DLA CSM verify AACs to reflect the
              proper approach for ordering & replenishing these items.

              Post-mitigated:

              – No Change to Brown (not option for Status)

              --- Can change to green if no backorder or no prior demand and/or assets
              available to cover demand for time period

              --- Can change to red or yellow depending on backorders, contract issues, factor
              changes, asset posture dictates red or yellow according to Red and Yellow
              pre/post-mitigated logic

                            DEEP LOOK INITIAL OUT BRIEF

A10.1. The charts below were designed as a template for use at Ogden ALC during development
of Deep Look Center processes and procedures. They were provided during Deep Look Center
cross-complex deployment to Oklahoma City ALC in November 2011 and Warner Robins ALC
in January 2012. Subsequently, the template evolved as processes matured at Ogden. As the
content and the automation of the envisioned Operating Plan evolves, the content of the out brief
will also change.
