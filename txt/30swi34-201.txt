1. General.
    1.1. Personnel assigned to the VAFB HG demonstrate the finest traditions of the United States Air
    Force (USAF) in discipline, appearance, attitude and competence. This team represents VAFB and the
    USAF at specific military and civilian functions. Personnel assigned to the team must comply with
    AFI 36-2903 and DOD Directive 5500.7 both on and off duty. Only those personnel who present a
    professional image and are not enrolled in the Fitness Improvement Program will be considered for
    assignment to the HG.
    1.2. Public Law 106-65 states funeral honors will be furnished for active and retired members as well
    as veterans who served at least one term of enlistment and have departed under conditions other than
    dishonorable. AFI 34-242 establishes the minimum number of personnel required for funeral details.
    The HG is tasked to primarily perform funerals. Additionally, other ceremonial details are performed
    based on availability after funeral commitments are met. Performances by the HG are considered to be
    mission essential in order to meet requirements of established regulations and maintain goodwill with
    the local communities. The HG Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC) will screen each
    requested performance for compliance with applicable instructions, laws, or regulations before
    approval is given to perform. The priority sequence for performance by the HG is as follows:
       1.2.1. Medal of Honor funeral
       1.2.2. Active Duty Air Force personnel funeral
       1.2.3. Retired Air Force personnel funeral
       1.2.4. Air Force Veteran funeral
       1.2.5. Support of visiting dignitaries
       1.2.6. Change of command ceremonies
       1.2.7. Wing or Group level retirement ceremonies
       1.2.8. Wing or Group social events (dining-in/out, retreats, etc.)
       1.2.9. Base graduation ceremonies
       1.2.10. Squadron level ceremonies
       1.2.11. Active duty Air Force personnel weddings
       1.2.12. Community events
    1.3. The HG will be available to provide essential military honors for funeral services with a 24-hour
    notice. All military requests for ceremonial honors are submitted to the HG NCOIC. All requests,
    other than funeral requests, need to be submitted at least 30 days before the scheduled event. All civil-
    ian requests will be sent to the 30th Space Wing Public Affairs office (30 SW/PA) at least 45 days
    before the scheduled event. Exceptions to the time constraints established by this regulation will be
    considered on a case-by-case basis.
    1.4. Personnel assigned to the HG are excused from all squadron and wing additional duties with the
    exception of mobility. Assignment to a mobility position does not prohibit an individual from being a
    member of the HG. Honor Guard members will have total exemption from base exercises and be
    released from their duty section to perform military honors at funerals, memorial services and take

   part in mandatory HG training, unless the unit commander deems the unit mission will be adversely
   impacted.

2. Manpower.
   2.1. Team manning must meet the minimum personnel requirements as designated by the installation
   commander. Team manning will be drawn from 30th Space Wing (30 SW) and associate units’ per-
   sonnel to man a minimum 42-person HG team.
   2.2. Units are responsible to assign personnel to the HG to maintain their established allocation. Vol-
   unteers are accepted as part of that unit's requirement. Designated quotas required from each unit in
   their respective Groups are listed below:

   2.3. Supplemental personnel (i.e. ROTC, Guard and Reserve and Retired members) may serve as an
   authorized provider in accordance with DOD Directive 1300.15 and receive compensation in accor-
   dance with memorandum dated March 11, 2004, from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense.
   Supplemental personnel who volunteer to assist active duty military in delivery of funeral honors
   must meet the standards established in paragraph 8. of this instruction.

3. Assignment to the Base HG Team.
   3.1. Volunteers or unit assigned members for the HG are required to complete an HG Letter of
   Assignment and send it to the HG NCOIC requesting consideration to be a member of the team within
   10 duty days of issuance. Personnel not assigned to the 30 SW or associate units are required to com-
   plete an HG Contract requesting consideration to be a member of the team within 10 duty days of issu-
   ance. The member's immediate supervisor, First Sergeant and Commander must sign the form. A
   completed form will indicate the following:
       3.1.1. Member's records have been screened and there is no unfavorable information on file.
       3.1.2. Member is authorized to handle weapons.
       3.1.3. Member meets the criteria described in paragraph 1.1. of this instruction.

       ship and support the tasking of the HG.
   3.2. After completing the letter of assignment, the individual is required to meet with the HG OIC or
   NCOIC for a personal interview. The purpose of the interview is to ensure that the individual under-
   stands the criteria to be an HG member and to make the member fully aware of the time and dedica-
   tion required of all members. If an applicant is not selected, the HG OIC or NCOIC will notify the
4                                                                       30SWI34-201 28 MARCH 2007


    applicant by letter, explaining the reasons for non-selection. A copy of non-selections will be sent to
    the individual’s unit, Chief, Combat Support Flight (SVM) and Director, 30th Services Division (SV).
    3.3. Assignment to the HG is for a minimum term of 1 year upon completion of fundamentals train-
    ing. Individuals assigned to the team are placed in a probationary period following the fundamentals
    training, not to exceed 90 days. The purpose of the probationary period is to ensure that each individ-
    ual is fully trained and capable of performing to standards and can cope with the physical and mental
    stress associated with HG functions.
    3.4. Personnel assigned to critical mission support positions, or positions in which only one individ-
    ual can perform the job, should not be nominated for a slot on the HG. Supervisors of individuals vol-
    unteering for the team should seriously consider the impact on their unit's mission before allowing the
    individual to join the team.
    3.5. Members, who deploy, require leave of absence due to pregnancy or any other circumstance that
    will remove them from HG service for a period greater than 6 weeks will have their year assignment

    3.6. For members who are not in an assigned manned position, a new contract will be signed 30 days
    prior to the anniversary of the original letter of assignment to ensure all active members have a current
    contract on file. For members who are in an assigned manned position, their contract will be continual
    until they are replaced. To be replaced, that individuals replacement must be uniformed and trained,
    before the individual can be removed from the team.

4. Procedures.
    4.1. Members will be assigned to either Alpha or Bravo Flight after completion of initial training.

       16th of the month through the end of that current month. Members will not be required to perform
       military honors outside of their rotation, unless the HG receives multiple requests and the on-duty
       flight does not have sufficient manning to fulfill all detail requirements. The HG NCOIC will
       recall the required additional members. This will be accomplished only in support of funeral
       details.
           4.1.1.1. Members will be available to perform all details, without exception, as outlined in
           paragraph 1.4. of this instruction.

       4.1.2. Retirement ceremonies, changes of command and all other unit functions will first be filled
       by HG members belonging to that unit. If there are insufficient HG members belonging to that unit

       to all members, on and off of the standby flights.
       4.1.3. Newly assigned members will be required to attend a 5-day, 40-hour initial training session.
       The purpose of this training session is to get new members fully trained in the shortest amount of

   replacement and inform the HG OIC/NCOIC as soon as possible, but before the designated show
   time. Any member not showing for a scheduled detail will receive administrative actions by the HG
   OIC or NCOIC as deemed appropriate.
   4.4. Members selected to perform a detail are required to notify their respective supervisors. In cases
