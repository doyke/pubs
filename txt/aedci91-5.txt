This publication does not replace higher requirements but implements Safety, Health, and
Environmental (SHE) processes to applicable activities at Arnold Engineering Development
Complex (AEDC). This instruction is intended to be compatible and to integrate with existing
AEDC Government and Contractor processes. The intent is to establish the standard for
implementing a uniform and effective approach to Complex-wide SHE processes.

Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed
of IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT
