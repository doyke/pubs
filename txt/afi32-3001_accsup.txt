     1.6.3. Destroy explosive ordnance (EO) according to all local, state, Federal, and host nation environ-
     mental, health, and safety requirements. To facilitate off-base emergency response actions, EOD
     Flights should establish, in coordination with the installation environmental offices, a Memorandum
     of Understanding (MOU) with their State agency responsible for environmental quality. See Attach-
     ment 2 for a sample MOU.
     1.6.4. Prior to performing EOD procedures, response teams must positively identify and verify all
     ordnance in EOD technical data. If no technical data exists for the item in question, then other means
     will be used to identify ordnance. For example: x-rays can help identify what type of filler is inside the
     ordnance and the type of fuzing. There are two resources for ordnance information:
        1.6.4.1. Requests for information to aid in identification of unknown ordnance can be sent to the
        NAVEODTECHDIV thru Det 63 (1-301-744-6824, DSN 354).
        1.6.4.2. The Technical Support Center (TSC) is available at 1-877-EOD INFO (1-877-363-4636)
        or you may submit a request for information (RFI) via the TSC SIPRNET web page, https://
        tsc.jeodnet.smil.mil or via email at TSC@jeodnet.mil.
     1.6.5. Perform initial on-site detection and point detection at the assumed source for known CBRNE
     materials during IED, suspect package, bomb threat and munitions responses when CBRNE hazards
     are indicated. CE Readiness will perform any follow-on support for CBRNE detection necessary after
     explosive hazard is negated. May perform gross decontamination on munitions and IEDs after they
     are rendered-safe and leak-sealed.
     1.6.6. Support Federal and Joint Service EOD taskings (i.e., United States Secret Service (USSS),
     VIP protection teams, and Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command taskings) and issue official pass-
     ports to each EOD individual.
     1.6.7. Ensure personnel meet the requirements for demolition duty pay and document monthly quali-
     fications.

   1.6.14. Ensure emergency notification procedures (e.g., command post or other agency checklists)
   include the installation legal and public affairs offices when responding off base. Include the installa-
   tion legal and public affairs offices in notification of all routine requests for EOD assistance to civil
   authorities.

1.7. EOD Flight Organization:
   1.7.1. Wartime/contingencies EOD flight force structure and mission capabilities are outlined in the
   WMP-1, Annex S, Appendix 9.
   1.7.2. Peacetime EOD flights are organized functionally and will have the following minimum areas.
      1.7.2.1. Flight Management and Quality Assurance.
      1.7.2.2. Operations and Scheduling.

Section 1B—Personnel

1.8. Administration of EOD Personnel:
   1.8.1. Qualifications. EOD Personnel must meet the requirements in the Officer Classification Direc-
   tory and Enlisted Classification Directory respectively, and must be assigned to a valid EOD position
   on a Unit Manning Document (UMD) to perform EOD duties.
   1.8.2. Proficiency. EOD personnel must maintain competency in all aspects of the EOD mission.
   Completion of the minimum training requirements listed in the 3E8X1 Career Field Education Train-
   ing Program (CFETP), Section G; AF EOD Standard Training Package, is required to maintain profi-
   ciency.
   1.8.3. Removal from EOD duties and the EOD flight. Because of the nature of EOD duties (working
   with live explosives and providing protective support to Presidential and State Department personnel),
   Airmen may be removed from EOD duties and the flight when their reliability and judgment are
16                                                     AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008


     called into question. Removal from EOD duties by itself is neither an adverse personnel action nor the
     basis for disciplinary action. When making a removal determination, the issue is not an individual’s
     guilt or innocence of a particular offense. It is not necessary to complete an investigation, take disci-
     plinary action, or to complete other personnel actions before determining to remove an individual
     from EOD duties.
        1.8.3.1. Removal may be appropriate based on a single serious incident or habitual minor inci-
        dents, reflecting behavior that is inconsistent with military standards and raises questions about an
        individual’s reliability and judgment. Any of the following may result in suspension of duties and/
        or removal from the flight.
            1.8.3.1.1. Any alcohol-related incident, alcohol abuse, or alcohol dependency.
            1.8.3.1.2. Significant delinquent financial obligations.
            1.8.3.1.3. Negligence or delinquency in performing duties that reveals a lack of dependability,
            flexibility, good attitude or good judgment.
            1.8.3.1.4. Arrest or conviction by a military or civilian court, or non-judicial punishment
            action, of a serious offense, including both felonies and misdemeanors, or involvement in a
            serious incident or pattern of behavior or conduct that is reasonably indicative of a contemptu-
            ous attitude toward the law or other duly constituted authority.
            1.8.3.1.5. Any significant physical or medical condition determined to be prejudicial to reli-
            able performance of EOD duties.
            1.8.3.1.6. Poor attitude or lack of motivation as evidenced by aberrant or irrational behavior,
            inappropriate behavior or mood.
            1.8.3.1.7. Failure to maintain a proper grade/skill relationship.
        1.8.3.2. Establishment of a Security Information File or suspension of access to classified infor-
        mation will result in temporary removal from EOD duties and the flight. Revocation of security
        clearance eligibility will result in disqualification from EOD duties and removal from the flight.
        1.8.3.3. When the conditions described in section 1.8.3.1. occur, commanders may take the fol-
        lowing actions:
            1.8.3.3.1. Temporary removal from duties and the EOD Flight. Immediately suspend an indi-
            vidual for up to 180 days in order to determine whether, given the nature of the incident(s), the
            individual’s reliability and judgment meet the standards for reinstatement to EOD duties.
            1.8.3.3.2. Permanent disqualification of an individual from EOD duties. Situations such as the
            following are grounds for permanent disqualification: confirmed drug abuse, a diagnosis of
            alcohol dependence, pending involuntary discharge or removal for cause, a diagnosed psychi-
            atric disorder that interferes with member’s ability to perform military duties, imposition of
            non-judicial punishment, pending court-martial charges and/or conviction, pending civilian
            criminal felony or misdemeanor charges and/or conviction. Commanders should seek legal
            advice before permanently removing an individual from EOD duties.
NOTE: Permanent disqualification of an individual from EOD duties may include removal of the EOD
qualification duty badge. Submit recommendations for removal through EOD MAJCOM functional staff
to HQ AFCESA/CEXD for determination.
AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                  17


          1.8.3.3.3. Reinstatement. A commander may request reinstatement of an individual’s qualifi-
          cation for EOD duties provided the reason or condition of the permanent disqualification no
          longer exists. Forward all requests for reinstatement to HQ AFCESA/CEXD. The request will
          include chain of command recommendations and all documentation that substantiated the per-
          manent disqualification and documentation that supports the opinion that the condition or rea-
          son no longer exists.
       1.8.3.4. Appeal. An individual may appeal a permanent disqualification. Individuals must provide
       a written request for an appeal with rationale. Forward all appeal requests to HQ AFCESA/CEXD
       for approval or disapproval. The request will include chain of command recommendations and all
       documentation that substantiated the disqualification determination.
   1.8.4. Interruption in EOD duties. EOD Personnel must reaccomplish the basic EOD course when
   they have been assigned 48 months or longer in a non-EOD position or if there is a 36-month or longer
   break in service. Under extenuating circumstances (i.e., if special EOD training or operations were
   accomplished during that time), this requirement may be fulfilled if the individual can be recertified
   on all CFETP Core Tasks (commensurate with grade/skill level), and attend the Advanced IED Defeat
   course.
       1.8.4.1. For active duty forces the AF EOD Career Field Manager, in consultation with the
       responsible MAJCOM, has waiver authority for this requirement on a case-by-case basis.
          1.8.4.1.1. The individual’s prior service EOD history will be evaluated to ensure the individ-
          ual is qualified for EOD duties, meets criteria listed in Officer/Enlisted Classification Direc-
          tory, and meets Air Force Quality Standards.
          1.8.4.1.2. Waiver authority for ARC forces is delegated to the ARC EOD Functional Manag-
          ers.
   1.8.5. Re-training: EOD cannot accept enlisted Airmen above the rank of SSgt for retraining without
   case-by-case approval of the EOD Career Field Functional Manager. EOD operations require experi-
   enced technical leadership.1
   1.8.6. Incentive Pay. This section outlines service component requirements in compliance with DoD
   7000-14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 7A, Military Pay Policy and Procedures
   – Active Duty and Reserve Pay.
       1.8.6.1. EOD personnel in a valid EOD position receiving demolition pay must document
       monthly qualifications.
       1.8.6.2. During periods of deployments and at locations where monthly qualification is not possi-
       ble, MAJCOM functional managers may temporarily waive this requirement. See paragraph
       3.11.1.2.

Section 1C—Manning


1. Limiting re-training to E-5s provides for an approximate 10 year experience/growth into flight
management and team leadership; additionally, it parallels requirements for civilian supervision of
explosive operations (DDESB technical paper 16) and US Army EOD TTP that calls for E-6 squad
leaders.
18                                                    AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008


1.9. Operational manning requirements.
     1.9.1. Deployment coding. All EOD flight members will be coded DWS or DXS. Ten positions (20
     positions for large range flights at Eglin, Hill, Luke, and Nellis AFBs) on each EOD flight UMD will
     be coded DXS, all others will be coded DWS. All AF EOD instructors (NAVSCOLEOD and Silver
     Flag) will be coded DXX. EOD Staff positions at HAF, AFCESA, MAJCOM and Det 63 will be
     coded DXS. All other EOD positions not addressed in this paragraph will be coded DXS. This para-
     graph does not apply to joint or classified EOD positions.
     1.9.2. Manpower Standard and Unit Personnel Management Roster (UPMR). The Air Force Man-
     power Standard (AFMS) for AF EOD is AFMS 44ED (https://www.afma.randolph.af.mil/orgunits/
     MAS/AFMS/index.asp). It is a peacetime manning standard that structures our forces aligned with
     logical peacetime mission areas to support Homeland Defense and preparation for contingency sup-
     port.
     1.9.3. EOD Flight Posturing. EOD Flights are primarily structured as large-range flights (60 person-
     nel), large force-projection flights (24 personnel), and small force-projection flights (18 personnel).
        1.9.3.1. USAF EOD minimum Sustainable manpower. Ten personnel, 20 at large range flights,
        are required to meet all mission area requirements identified in AFPD 32-30, Explosive Ordnance
        Disposal. This provides sufficient manpower structure to 1) maintain missions for an indefinite
        period of time; 2) provides the proper leadership & mentoring; 3) and maintain required training
        proficiency. Manpower includes: two 3-person teams, two supervisors and two operations person-
        nel. Up to four of these personnel can be available to support VIPPSA and RST missions. The
        additional 10 personnel at Large range flights are required to maintain emergency response for
        range operations. Support for scheduled range clearances, as outlined in AFI 13-212, Range Plan-
        ning and Operations, Volume 1, will require manning augmentation from other EOD flights.
        1.9.3.2. USAF EOD minimum Break-the-Flight manpower. If, during surge or emergency opera-
        tions, an EOD flight falls below Sustainable manpower, a degraded capability exists.
            1.9.3.2.1. A manpower structure of 6-9 personnel is only sufficient to provide limited mission
            areas support and only a single-incident response capability. An EOD flight can maintain this
            level of support for eight months. After eight months, the EOD flight must be rated C-3
            (non-mission capable) until all Initial Job Qualification Standard (IJQS) tasks are recertified.
            1.9.3.2.1. (ACC) Personnel returning from deployments longer than 180 days must be reeval-
            uated on certified tasks as part of their initial job qualification standard home station emer-
            gency response tasks. If member is still current and only requires refresher, schedule
            immediate refresher and document using Air Force Training Record or other automated pro-
            gram. If member is not current and fails reevaluation then recertify IAW AFI 36-2201V3, Air
            Force Training Program On The Job Training Administration and Career Field Education and
            Training Plan (CFETP). Document the reevaluation on AF Form 623a, On-The-Job Training
            Record Continuation Sheet.
            1.9.3.2.2. Support for missions that are beyond emergency installation and force protection
            response (e.g., missions other than nuclear/strategic mission, force protection, and aircraft/
            munitions response) require critical operational risk management determination. At this level
            of manning, required training proficiency and certifications can not be maintained. Flights
            falling below 10 personnel (20 personnel for large range flights) for periods longer than 30
AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                             19


         days should request manning assistance through their respective MAJCOM functional man-
         ager.
         1.9.3.2.3. (Added-ACC) Direct support units must maintain at least six certified members on
         base to support special weapons and strategic operations. Anything below this number must be
         coordinated with HQ ACC/A7XE to ensure proper support to strategic assets.
         1.9.3.2.4. (Added-ACC) Each newly assigned person will be task qualified on all local pro-
         cedures before being placed on standby duty.
         1.9.3.2.5. (Added-ACC) Request manning assistance through HQ ACC/A7XE with require-
         ments. Unit will be responsible for all per diem and travel.
  1.9.4. (Added-ACC) Request Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command support when
  Air Reserve Component (ARC) personnel volunteer to support flight operations. ARC units need
  approval from their component headquarters. Man-day requests will be submitted through unit reserve
  coordinator. Inform HQ ACC/A7XE of the request 60 days before the projected start of man-day sup-
  port.
  1.9.5. (Added-ACC) Manning Assistance Participation. ACC EOD personnel will not participate
  (volunteered or tasked) in other MAJCOM/sister service manning support missions without prior HQ
  ACC/A7XE approval. ARC units need approval from their component headquarters.

      pre-deployment training and upon initial arrival at the deployed location in accordance with the-
      ater guidance.

Section 2C—Safety Programs

2.4. Weapons Safety. EOD requirements for Weapons Safety are covered in AFMAN 91-201, Explo-
sives Safety Standards.
   2.4.1. Proficiency range parameters. The authorized procedures on EOD ranges allow for reduced
   safe separation distances. Specifications for EOD proficiency ranges are listed in AFMAN 91-201,
   Air Force Explosives Safety Standards.
   2.4.2. Emergency destruction on established ranges. In cases where the net explosive weight and
   fragmentation hazards exceed the established quantity-distance criteria for a range, obtain installation
   commander’s permission, perform ORM, and use protective measures to ensure safe operations.

2.5. Ground Safety Programs. Occupational Safety requirements are listed in AFOSHSTD 91-501, Air
Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Standard. EOD Flights must participate in the following health
and safety programs.
     2.5.1. Environmental Management System, Hazardous Communication (HAZCOM).
     2.5.2. Respiratory Protection Program.
     2.5.3. Blood Borne Pathogen (BBP).
        2.5.3.1. With use of established control procedures (use of personal protective equipment (PPE)
        and good hygiene); normal home-station EOD duties do not warrant participation in the BBP pro-
        gram.
        2.5.3.2. If local or deployed special EOD missions create a high potential for exposure to BBP,
        then EOD flights will coordinate with Bioenvironmental Engineering and Public Health flights to
        determine whether enrollment in this program is appropriate.
        2.5.3.3. Refer to Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 1910, subpart Z, Standard
        1910-1030, Bloodborne Pathogens (29 CFR 1910-1030), for requirements on training and a writ-
        ten exposure control plan (see also the sample guides in the EOD Mortuary Support CONOP).
     2.5.4. As-Low-As-Reasonably-Achievable (ALARA).
     2.5.5. Hearing conservation.

Section 3A—Operational Parameters.

3.1. General Unexploded Ordnance Response Actions
   3.1.1. Positive Identification. Responding EOD teams must positively identify all ordnance items
   prior to performing any EOD procedures.
      3.1.1.1. All research and identification of ordnance items will be documented in EOD reports and
      verified as outlined in Para 3.8.1. If unable to identify the ordnance item the team must assume:
          3.1.1.1.1. It is the most hazardous type it could be.
          3.1.1.1.2. It has the most hazardous features/filler it could contain.
          3.1.1.1.3. It is in the most hazardous condition it could be in.
      3.1.1.2. EOD flights will put statements in their response guides that the team must positively
      identify ordnance using EOD technical data prior to performing any EOD procedures. If no tech-
      nical data exists for the item in question, then other means will be used to identify ordnance. For
      example: x-rays could be used to help identify what type of filler is inside the ordnance and the
      type of fuzing or a request for information can be sent to the NAVEODTECHDIV thru Det 63..
      The Technical Support Center, manned 24 hours is a resource available for assistance at
      1-877-EOD INFO (1-877-363-4636)
      3.1.1.3. (Added-ACC) Notify HQ ACC/A7XE immediately upon request or completion of any
      response that requires emergency EOD action, i.e., render safe attempt of a suspect improvised
      explosive device (IED), any disposal deemed an emergency, or any Level 1 or 2 response. Contact
      HQ ACC/A7XE via Automated Civil Engineer System-Explosive Ordnance Disposal
      (ACES-EOD) events log, email or fax and provide a brief note explaining the situation. This
      requirement does not apply to ARC EOD units.
      3.1.1.4. (Added-ACC) During EOD operations and training, flights are not authorized to employ
      demolition material, EOD equipment/supplies using explosives, or equipment controlling the ini-
      tiation of explosives without approved technical data and Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board
      (NNMSB) approval. 688th Armament Support Squadron, Detachment 63 (688 ARSS Det 63)
      serves as the Air Force action office for approval of joint 60-series technical data and is responsi-
      ble for development of preliminary technical data for Air Force unique EOD equipment and pro-
      cedures. All preliminary technical data must be approved by HQ ACC/A7XE before release to
      EOD Flights.
   3.1.2. EOD Technical Guidance. EOD procedures are conducted in accordance with Joint Service
   EOD 60-series Technical Orders (TOs). Supporting instructions such as 11-series TOs or DDESB
   Technical Papers (available at http://www.ddesb.pentagon.mil/techpapers.html) may be used in
   absence of 60-series guidance. Additionally, basic EOD emergency response guidance is provide in
   Attachment 3. Local commanders have the authority and responsibility to make operational risk
   management adjustment to established requirements so that mission requirements are met.
24                                                     AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008


        3.1.2.1. Deviations from 60N series can be made with coordination and approval with MAJCOM
        and 708th Nuclear System Squadron (708th NSS), Military Liaison Branch. During accident
        response, deviations from 60N are obtained through the Nuclear Weapon Accident Response Pro-
        cedures (NARP) weapon recovery process. By design, 60N series publications do not address all
        potential accident/incident scenarios. During an accident situation EOD personnel in collaboration
        with DOE ARG will develop a weapons recovery plan incorporating pertinent paragraphs from
        specific weapon 60N series tech order.
     3.1.3. Medical support. Medical support during high-explosives operations is a mandatory safety
     requirement. Medical support must remain in a designated safe area unless required for injury/incident
     response. Medical support may be military, civilian, or contracted as long as the qualifications are cur-
     rent and time criteria are met.
        3.1.3.1. Explosives operations involving only practice munitions (other than demolition explo-
        sives): An Independent Duty Medical Technician (IDMT) or Emergency Medical Technician
        (EMT)-qualified technician must be available on-site or within a 30-minute response time.
        Trauma facilities should be available within 60 minutes via ground or air transportation.
        3.1.3.2. Explosives operations involving live munitions (other than demolition explosives): An
        IDMT-qualified technician must be available on-site during all operations. An IDMT provides
        capability to give Advanced Cardiac Life Support measures such as administering emergency
        intravenous medications. Trauma facilities should be available within 30 minutes via ground or air
        transportation. If not possible, then ensure a paramedic or emergency medical technician with cur-
        rent NREMT (National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians) certification is available
        on-range.
        3.1.3.3. EOD flights performing daily, multiple, simultaneous explosives operations involving
        live munitions should have an IDMT-qualified technician dedicated/assigned to the EOD flight.
        IDMT would be within 30-minute response time to all explosives operating sites. Supplement the
        IDMT with EMT-qualified technicians on-site at each operating site, e.g., one IDMT is centrally
        located within 30-minutes of the operations. Each operating site would have an EMT immediately
        available.
     3.1.4. Off-Installation Responses.
        3.1.4.1. Military munitions and explosives.
            3.1.4.1.1. The closest AF EOD flight is required to respond to accidents/incidents involving
            AF-owned EO on or off AF installations. The first service to discover an incident involving
            EO of another service or Federal agency must take immediate actions to prevent or limit dam-
            age or injury. Report incidents occurring in another service's operational area according to the
            procedures of the responsible service. The closest EOD flight should respond immediately
            with the understanding that the responsible service retains operational control. After DoD
            arrives on scene, the various services can sort out responsibilities per AFJI 32-3002.
            3.1.4.1.2. The first service to discover a transportation accident/incident involving federally
            owned or controlled EO must respond immediately, regardless of location. The EOD team
            should arrive on-scene as soon as possible (within 4 hours). Use the fastest mode of transpor-
            tation available. The objective is to prevent or limit loss of life, injury, property damage, and
            minimize public inconvenience. Note: The first priority is an immediate response to the acci-
AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                  25


         dent or incident. After DoD arrives on scene, the various services can sort out responsibilities
         per AFJI 32-3002.
     3.1.4.2. Non-military munitions and explosives.
         3.1.4.2.1. Civil authorities are primarily responsible for the safe handling and disposal of IED,
         nonmilitary commercial explosives, or similarly dangerous articles located off DoD installa-
         tions. See details for off-installation support in paragraphs 7.2. and 7.3.
         3.1.4.2.2. Non-DoD toxic or hazardous materials are not taken to military installations for
         storage or disposal unless:
             3.1.4.2.2.1. The situation is clearly an emergency or lifesaving operation.
             3.1.4.2.2.2. Formal agreements exist with other Federal agencies (e.g., Memorandum of
             Understanding between DoD and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explo-
             sives).
  3.1.5. Environmental Guidance. All Air Force EOD flights within the United States and its territories
  must comply with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) EPA Military Munitions
  Rule, and other state regulatory requirements. EOD Response Actions are conducted under authority
  of the “DoD Policy to implement the federal EPA Military Munitions Rule (MRIP),” chapter 9, Emer-
  gency Response. The MRIP is very specific about the conduct of emergency response and EOD’s
  authority to conduct them.
     3.1.5.1. In non-emergency situations, to ensure all legal requirements are met, EOD personnel
     must consult the Staff Judge Advocate and the installation Civil Engineer environmental manage-
     ment function before destroying EO (see paragraph 3.2. for emergency parameters).
     3.1.5.2. The federal EPA has established definitions for when munitions become a waste and
     requirements for management of waste munitions. These definitions and requirements are incor-
     porated into RCRA’s implementing regulations. The federal program exempts EOD from some
     environmental management requirements during an EOD emergency response action for muni-
     tions and other explosive devices (military and non-military). The degree of exemption from fed-
     eral RCRA regulations depends upon the level of response. However, states may have more
     stringent requirements than the federal regulations.
     3.1.5.3. The Department of Defense has created two levels of EOD emergency response; immedi-
     ate response (Level 1) and imminent and substantial endangerment (Level 2). The primary distinc-
     tion between the two levels is that a Level 2 response can be delayed without compromising safety
     or increasing the risks posed to life, property, health, or the environment.
         3.1.5.3.1. Treat all requests for EOD response as a Level 1 response until determined other-
         wise. From an explosives safety point of view, when EOD technicians are dispatched, the sit-
         uation requires an immediate response.
         3.1.5.3.2. The on-scene EOD technician determines if the situation requires a Level 1, Level
         2, or no EOD emergency response.
         3.1.5.3.3. Only the senior on-scene EOD technician can determine when the response action
         is complete. For a Level 2 response, temporary storage in a munitions storage facility should
         not terminate the emergency nature of the response – normally, wait for termination until final
         destruction or shipment to a destruction facility.

3.2. Explosives or Munitions Emergency Response : Level 1 emergency response actions are exempt
from RCRA permitting, DOT manifesting for movement to a safe disposal area, and other substantive
requirements under Title 40 CFR.2 However, Level 2 emergency response actions may be subject to emer-
gency permitting and other requirements. When, during an emergency response, applicable state law or an
agreement requires, or the situation allows, the installation environmental office will consult with envi-
ronmental regulators on the need for permits and fulfilling other requirements.
     3.2.1. Level 1 Emergency Response (Immediate Response). A Level 1 Emergency could occur any-
     where. A Level 1 Emergency requires immediate response activities to eliminate or address the actual
     or potential imminent threat to life, property, health or the environment.
        3.2.1.1. A Level 1 Emergency exists if a delay in response activities would compromise safety or
        increase the risks posed to life, property, health or the environment. (Note: A reasonable delay in
        EOD's completion of an explosives or munitions emergency response that is caused by necessary,
        unforeseen, or uncontrollable circumstances does not automatically terminate a Level 1 Emer-
        gency.) A Level 1 Emergency may exist if:
            3.2.1.1.1. The risk associated with movement of the military munition or other explosives
            involved is unknown or not acceptable; or
            3.2.1.1.2. The risk associated with the military munitions or other explosives temporary stor-
            age, or careful movement beyond a nearby, more isolated and protected location for immediate
            rendering-safe or destruction, is not acceptable.
        3.2.1.2. The lead on-site EOD Technician will, with regard to any explosive or chemical agent
        hazard presented: (a) determine whether a Level 1 Emergency exists, and (b) when to terminate a
        Level 1 Emergency response, or reclassify it to a Level 2 response. Once the immediate hazards
        associated with military munitions or other explosives are eliminated, the supported installation or
        activity may have to perform other actions to address the impact of the response action. (See para-
        graph 3.2.3. below.)
        3.2.1.3. EOD-conducted response actions during a Level 1 Emergency could involve defuzing,
        detonation, or other actions to neutralize a munition “in-place,” or careful, limited movement to a
        nearby, more isolated and protected location, including to an operational range used by or limited
        to EOD operations, to defuze, detonate, or otherwise abate the immediate threat.
        3.2.1.4. Level 1 emergency response actions, where the response cannot be delayed without com-
        promising safety or increasing the risks posed to life, property, health, or the environment, are
        exempt from RCRA permitting, DOT manifesting for movement to a safe disposal area, and other
        substantive requirements.
            3.2.1.4.1. Level 1 EOD response actions are exempt from federal RCRA permitting require-
            ments.

AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                  27


         3.2.1.4.2. Response may occur on-site or the item may be transported to a more secure loca-
         tion.
         3.2.1.4.3. No Hazardous Waste Manifest is required.
         3.2.1.4.4. Transporter of the item does not need a RCRA identification number.
         3.2.1.4.5. Item may be held in appropriate storage as a continuation of the response if a proper
         location for the response action is unavailable due to extenuating circumstances (e.g. adverse
         weather, nightfall, or other safety considerations).
         3.2.1.4.6. Storage location does not have to be a RCRA interim status or RCRA permitted
         facility or comply in any way with RCRA; however, it must comply with DDESB standards.
  3.2.2. Level 2 Emergency Response (Imminent and Substantial Endangerment). A Level 2 Emer-
  gency also poses an actual or potential imminent threat to life, property, health or human health or the
  environment, but does not require immediate response activities to eliminate or address the actual or
  potential imminent threat. Level 2 Emergency response actions can generally be delayed for a reason-
  able period without adverse impact.
     3.2.2.1. A Level 2 Emergency exists if the response actions can be delayed without compromising
     safety or increasing the risks posed to life, property, health, or the environment. A Level 2 Emer-
     gency may exist if:
         3.2.2.1.1. The risk associated with movement and temporary storage of the military munition
         or other explosives involved is acceptable; and
         3.2.2.1.2. The military munitions or other explosives are positively identified, is safe for
         transport by explosives or munitions emergency response specialists, and can be stored (tem-
         porarily) within DoD's munitions logistic management system pending appropriate response
         action (e.g., on-site destruction or movement to an appropriate destruction facility).
     3.2.2.2. The on-site EOD Technician will, with regard the explosive or chemical agent hazard
     presented, determine: (1) whether a Level 2 Emergency exists; (2) when to terminate a Level 2
     Emergency; and/or (3) when to re-classify a Level 2 Emergency (e.g., risks become unacceptable)
     to a Level 1 Emergency. Once the immediate hazards associated with military munitions or other
     explosives are eliminated, the supported installation or activity may have to perform other actions
     to address the impact of the response action.
     3.2.2.3. The host installation's Environmental Office/Hazardous Waste Program Manager is
     responsible for consulting with environmental regulators to determine whether other regulatory
     requirements must be satisfied (e.g., a requirement to seek a RCRA emergency permit under sec-
     tion Title 40 CFR Part 270.61) and to obtain requisite emergency transportation and/or treatment
     permits. Emergency permits are usually granted orally with written follow-up.
         3.2.2.3.1. Off-base response permits. EOD flights should pre-coordinate local/state off-base
         permitting procedures with the installation environmental office. Under normal circum-
         stances;
             3.2.2.3.1.1. If EOD is responding to a military munition, then request the installation envi-
             ronmental office obtain necessary permits.
28                                                    AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008


                3.2.2.3.1.2. If responding to other than a military munition, then the civil authorities
                requesting support are responsible for requesting the necessary permits.
            3.2.2.3.2. For items turned-in to the munitions storage area, the munitions activity will imme-
            diately request the installation environmental office obtain the necessary permits and state
            notifications per local directives.
     3.2.3. Site Remediation. EOD personnel do not conduct planned munitions responses; however, they
     will respond to explosives or munitions emergencies that occur during planned responses. See para-
     graphs 3.5.6.2.2. and 3.5.6.2.3. 3 4 5
     3.2.4. Significant Disagreement. If, during an explosives or munitions emergency response, environ-
     mental regulators and safety officials have serious concerns about the potential impact of EOD's pro-
     posed course of action on human health and the environment the following applies:
        3.2.4.1. By DoD policy, EOD personnel are not allowed to take any action inconsistent with
        approved EOD procedures or that would place them at added risk.
        3.2.4.2. When a delay in conducting response activities will not compromise safety or increase
        risks, ensure protective measures are implemented until a mutually agreeable solution is reached.
        3.2.4.3. The environmental regulators or safety officials having serious concerns shall be
        requested to immediately elevate the concern to the next level of authority to attempt to achieve a
        mutually agreeable solution.
        3.2.4.4. Once an agreeable solution is attained, the appropriate DoD authority will coordinate
        EOD's support to resolve the emergency in a manner protective of human health and the environ-
        ment, and that is consistent with EOD procedures.
     3.2.5. Response Records. Flights will maintain EOD response records and a copy of any supporting
     documentation such as an emergency permit (if issued) in the EOD Incident Management System
     (EODIMS) database.3 HQ AFCESA/CEXD manages the EODIMS per Air Force Records Informa-
     tion Management System (AFRIMS) Table 33-49, Rule 20.01.
     3.2.6. (Added-ACC) Refer to AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management,
     (paragraph 3.11.) for disposition of munitions.

3.3. Planned Support: The U.S. Army has responsibility for routine or planned EOD operations within
the continental landmass. The exceptions to this policy occur when the EO is located on installations, dis-
persal bases, assigned operational areas, or in the physical possession of another service.

3.4. Contingency, Exercise, and Deployment (CED) Support
     3.4.1. EOD Capability.
        3.4.1.1. The four elements required to provide a combat EOD capability are:

3. Under 40 CFR §264.1(g)(8)(iv), the responding military emergency response specialists’ unit must
retain records for 3 years identifying the dates of the response, the responsible persons within the unit
involved, the type and description of material addressed, and its disposition. The DoD Military
Munitions Response Program requires retention of a permanent record of EOD responses for future land
restoration and remediation prior to release of DoD lands to the public.
AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                               29


          3.4.1.1.1. Response vehicle and specialized equipment sets.
          3.4.1.1.2. Explosives and demolition material.
          3.4.1.1.3. Joint-service technical data and viewing/communications set.
          3.4.1.1.4. EOD-qualified personnel/teams.
      3.4.1.2. EOD UTCs must have the capability to be fully mobile on initial deployment into any
      contingency. This requires vehicles to be part of EOD equipment UTCs so that all equipment and
      explosives can be loaded on a vehicle for transport. An EOD capability does not exist without the
      ability to respond with necessary equipment, communications, and explosives.
   3.4.2. Core Unit Type Code (UTC). The Air Force uses EOD UTCs in peace and war to provide com-
   batant commanders with an EOD capability. The WMP-1 provides details of required UTCs, sup-
   port-levels, and structure for differing threat-levels. Flights should request current copies of the
   WMP-1, Annex S, Appendix 9 (EOD) from their wing level A5 or MAJCOM representative.
      3.4.2.1. Each UTC has a Mission Capability Statements (MISCAP) that provides UTC limitations
      and capabilities (available on the AF EOD Program Management CoP at https://
      afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-CE-49).
      3.4.2.2. Core UTCs are designated as Lead and Base support. A Lead UTC can support one lead
      flying squadron for 24-hour operations without augmentation. Base-support UTCs augment addi-
      tional missions and other non-tactical or notional requirements.
   3.4.3. Joint EOD Operations.
      3.4.3.1. Refer to Joint service EOD Multi-service, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (MTTP),
      Oct 2005, Appendix B, for the EOD Planning Checklist for Joint Operations
      3.4.3.2. A theater combat mission may best be supported by a joint EOD structure. Details for
      supporting joint EOD operations are in AF Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (Interservice)
      (AFTTP(I)) 3-2.32, MTTP for EOD in a Joint Environment, Oct 2005.
   3.4.4. Employing/deploying recently graduated EOD Personnel.
      3.4.4.1. An EOD Apprentice (AF Specialty Code (AFSC) 3E831) is not deployment-eligible
      unless they have completed all requirements per paragraph 3.10.3.1.1.
          3.4.4.1.1. EOD Journeymen and Craftsmen will not be tasked to train our 3-level Airmen
          while directly supporting combat operations. To do so places our junior Airmen and the entire
          EOD team at increased risk of injury/loss of life.
          3.4.4.1.2. When possible, EOD Apprentices will be employed at locations with less risk
          where EOD persons with more developed experience and skills can train them prior to being
          assigned to locations of higher intensity.
      3.4.4.2. After graduation from EOD basic school, an EOD Officer (AF Specialty Code (AFSC)
      32E H/K) is not deployment-eligible until they have completed eight months at home station (two

3.5. Mission Areas. Each of the nine EOD mission areas listed in AFPD 32-30 are thoroughly expanded
and outlined in an AF EOD Concepts of Operation (CONOP), available electronically from the AF EOD
Program Management CoP. EOD flights use the guidelines provided in these CONOPs to augment the
general guidance offered below.
3.5. (ACC) Mission Areas. Flights will develop and use the following team chief operation guides:
Chemical/Biological (wartime defense only); Nuclear (required for ARC units with BOS mission); Con-
ventional; IED/Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD); Aircraft; Mobility. These guides will contain safety
briefings which include all applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) programs,
i.e. Blood Borne Pathogens (BBP), Respiratory Protection Program (RPP), as required.
     3.5.1. Aerospace Vehicle Launch and Recovery. Supporting sortie generation and Space operations
     by responding to airfield emergencies to render safe ordnance and aircraft during in-flight and ground
     emergencies or crash situations.
        3.5.1.1. EOD personnel are not end-of-runway crews; however, they should be familiar with
        communicating with and operating around running fixed-wing and rotary-winged aircraft. Peri-
        odic (annual) training with these crews can be beneficial experience for EOD personnel.
        3.5.1.2. EOD teams respond when End-of-Runway crews or transient alert personnel are unavail-
        able and/or when the aircraft/munitions system is in a hazardous condition.
        3.5.1.3. Refer to EOD Aerospace Vehicle CONOPs for more details.
     3.5.2. Force Protection. Eliminating or mitigating explosive hazards created by known or suspected
     criminal and terrorist devices.
        3.5.2.1. EOD teams do not normally perform searches in support of bomb-threats.
        3.5.2.2. Use diagnostics and remote procedures first: Hand-entry is a last resort.
        3.5.2.3. Use all available protective gear (e.g., bomb suit).
        3.5.2.4. Refer to the IED CONOP for more details.
     3.5.3. Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Providing full-spectrum response capability to nuclear,
     biological, chemical, radiological, incendiary, conventional explosive ordnance and IEDs. EOD teams
     respond during the crisis management phase of the incident and provide: initial response; situational
     analysis; advise command authorities on hazards and protective measures; and support regional/spe-
     cialized support teams as required. Refer to the WMD CONOP for more details.
     3.5.4. Nuclear Weapon Incident/Accident. Providing immediate initial support to nuclear weapon
     incidents/accidents. This section outlines service component requirements in DoDD 3150.2, DoD
     Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program.
     3.5.4. (ACC) Nuclear Weapon Incident/Accident. ACC EOD flights will respond in support of the
     Response Task Force (RTF). Taskings will be on a notional basis. Flights must ensure team leader
     response guide clearly states confirmation of weapons and status for all response to nuclear capable
     aircraft.
        3.5.4.1. All active duty AF EOD flights maintain qualification to provide emergency nuclear sup-
        port. Flight personnel maintain technical data and are trained to perform those actions necessary to
        stabilize an incident site.
AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                                     31


      3.5.4.2. Flights that support assigned nuclear weapons maintain technical data and are qualified in
      all aspects of assigned weapon systems (See paragraph 3.12.5.).
  3.5.5. Unexploded Explosive Ordnance (UXO) Recovery Operations. Clearing UXO during runway
  and airbase recovery operations and neutralizing hazards from explosive-related incidents, which,
  because of unusual circumstances, present a threat to operations, installations, personnel or material.
  See UXO-related mission details under paragraphs 3.1. and 3.2.
  3.5.6. Operational Range Clearance. Working together with range management offices and environ-
  mental agencies to clear operational ranges and test and evaluation ranges. This section outlines ser-
  vice component (EOD) requirements of DoDD 3200.16, Operational Range Clearance and DoDD
  4140.62, Management and Disposition of Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard
  (MPPEH). Further implementing guidance is provided in AFI 13-212, Range Planning and Opera-
  t i o n s , Vo l u m e 1 a n d t h e E O D R a n g e C O N O P ( h t t p s : / / a f k m . w p a f b . a f . m i l / D o c -
  View.asp?DocID=1113486).
      3.5.6.1. Practices for UXO clearance at operational ranges are different from those for environ-
      mental UXO remediation, and more closely mirror combat EOD duties and provides warskills
      experience for EOD operations. As in combat UXO area clearance, peacetime range clearance is
      usually only a surface clearance. At operational test and evaluation ranges, there are requirements
      for the sub-surface recovery of (sometimes deeply buried) experimental ordnance.
      3.5.6.2. Other-than Operational Range Support.
           3.5.6.2.1. EOD flights will not normally perform nor are they responsible for activities out-
           side the scope of AFI 13-212 in relation to any range or other munitions response site. The AF
           EOD program is neither equipped, trained, nor manned for environmental requirements-based
           munitions response operations.
           3.5.6.2.2. Non-emergency or planned support on other than operational ranges is outside the
           scope of core competencies for EOD. The below listed duties are examples of tasks EOD
           would not be responsible for:
               3.5.6.2.2.1. Third-party quality assurance evaluations of contracts.
               3.5.6.2.2.2. Natural & cultural environmental escorts.
               3.5.6.2.2.3. Research and provide ordnance information (other than emergency response).
               3.5.6.2.2.4. Construction support.
               3.5.6.2.2.5. Sub-surface UXO recovery (e.g., area remediation that is not in support of
               ordnance R&D/OT&E).
               3.5.6.2.2.6. Contract oversight.
               3.5.6.2.2.7. Lend-lease-grant final land clearance subsequent to land use by commercial
               ventures.
               3.5.6.2.2.8. Final land-surveys required prior to closure or re-characterization of opera-
               tional ranges.
           3.5.6.2.3. MAJCOM EOD staffs may authorize performance of the above tasks for unique
           individual situations/operations when it provides a warskills benefit. Parameters should be
           established in a supplement to this AFI and in individual memorandums between the contract

            CEXD on such memoranda.
            3.5.6.2.4. Emergency support to other than operational range activities is part of the core com-
            petencies for EOD. Upon proper notification, EOD responds to any munitions emergency
                3.5.6.2.4.1. To ensure Public Safety.
                3.5.6.2.4.2. To identify unknown munitions.
                3.5.6.2.4.3. When there are possible chemical munitions involved (limited to emergency
                actions prior to arrival of specialized teams).
            3.5.6.2.5. EOD will provide a one-time response to first found munitions or other emergency
            support as outlined in a MAJCOM EOD staff-coordinated memorandum of agreement (MOA)
            or other coordinating document. The MOA will include as a minimum a request to provide full
            support and the required amount of resources (equipment, explosives, personnel, time).
                3.5.6.2.5.1. Specific responsibilities provided (EPA permits, security, medical etc.).
                3.5.6.2.5.2. Specific responsibilities/duties military is to perform/conduct.

     rorist or other criminal acts, accidents, found explosive items, and other requests for support.
        3.5.8.1. See Chapter 7 for detailed guidelines on general support to civil authorities.
        3.5.8.2. Support to the US Secret Service (USSS) and US State Department (DoS) Very Important
        Persons Protection Support Activity (VIPPSA) taskings. This section outlines service component
        requirements in DoDD 3025.13, Employment of DoD Resources in Support of the United States
        Secret Service, and DoD Instruction (DoDI) 5030.34, Agreement Between the USSS and the DoD
        Concerning Protection of the President and Other Officials. Detailed procedures of support are
        provided in the USSS Hazardous Device Counter-measures Manual (HDCM).
        3.5.8.2. (ACC) Support to the US Secret Service and US State Department (DoS) Very Important
        Persons Protection Support Activity (VIPPSA) taskings. Personnel on AEF deployment standby
        may not be tasked.
            3.5.8.2.1. Reimbursement for VIPPSA support. Public Law 94-524, Presidential Protection
            Act of 1996, establishes the authority for non-reimbursable DoD support to the USSS for pro-
            tection of the President, Vice-President, or other officer immediately next in order of succes-
            sion to the office of the President. Lack of funding is not a reason for non-support of
            Presidential and Vice- presidential protective mission taskings. All other VIPPSA taskings are
            reimbursable. See paragraph 3.5.8.2.4.
            3.5.8.2.1. (ACC) Reimbursement for VIPPSA support. HQ ACC/A7XE forecasts funding to
            reimburse squadron accounts for President of the United States (POTUS) and Vice President
            of the United States (VPOTUS) missions. Units will proceed on their mission using a squad-
            ron fund cite and will be reimbursed after the fact.

       3.5.8.2.2. If the personnel are available without impacting the flight’s ability to perform its
       primary mission, then a VIPPSA tasking must be supported. See paragraph 1.9.4.7 to deter-
       mine availability of personnel.
          3.5.8.2.2.1. Coordinating Support. The U.S. Army is designated as the executive office for
          all VIPPSA taskings from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), United States
          Secret Service (USSS), or Department of State (DOS). They task and coordinate all mis-
          sions by DoD EOD personnel, regardless of service affiliation, through the U.S. Army
          EOD Very Important Persons Protection Support Activity (USAEODVIPPSA).
              3.5.8.2.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) Commander US Northern Command (CDRUSNORTH-
              COM) is designated as the executive office for all Very Important Persons (VIP) mis-
              sions from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), United States Secret Service

        or DoD missions. AFI 36-3014, Clothing Allowance for Air Force Personnel, specifies
        authorized amounts, how to apply, and how to get reimbursement. Flight chiefs selecting
        personnel for sup-port missions should first consider sending individuals already receiving
        a civilian clothing allowance. Note: Officers must be assigned to overseas EOD billets to
        receive the clothing allowance.
        3.5.8.2.9.2. EOD personnel supporting USAEODVIPPSA Presidential or Vice Presiden-
        tial taskings do not fall under the Presidential Support Program, unless such support
        exceeds 180 continuous days. (See DoDD 5210.55, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security

             placards and manuals in their possession semiannually (Jan/July) by using ACES EOD
             VIPPSA Module.
             3.5.8.2.10.5. Due to the access a pin affords the bearer, do not use or carry them except
             while supporting a VIP mission. During the mission, do not leave credentials or pins unat-
             tended in hotel rooms. Keep them in your possession at all times.
             3.5.8.2.10.5. (ACC) Flight leaders will investigate credential misuse and submit a written
             report to HQ ACC/A7XE within 30 days of the incident. Misuses of pins, or credentials are
             grounds for removal from VIP support missions and could lead to Uniform Code of Mili-
             tary Justice (UCMJ) actions.
             3.5.8.2.10.6. Immediately report lost DD Form(s) 2335, identification pins, vehicle plac-

   ness, terrorist bomb search procedures, and personnel protective measures.
      3.5.9.1. Air Force EOR is taught via web-based training. EOD may provide other methods to sup-
      plement the AF EOR course; however, the web-based training is the mandatory basic course.
      3.5.9.2. Flights should use HQ AFCESA-standardized informational training/briefings as a tem-
      plate for briefings on EOD mission capability, ordnance hazards and recognition, IED awareness,
      mine awareness, terrorist bomb search procedures, personnel protective measures, etc. These
      briefings are available on the AF EOD Program Management CoP at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/
      ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-CE-49.
      3.5.9.3. If EOD flights are requested to provide EOD-related briefings to national agencies (e.g.,
      Bureau of Land Management (BLM), DTRA, EPA, TSWG, DoD, etc), other military services, HQ
      USAF or Secretary of the AF agencies/offices, the briefings require review by MAJCOM EOD
      staff and HQ AFCESA/CEXD prior to being briefed/released.
      3.5.9.4. EOD flights should support community outreach programs to educate both installation
      personnel and the surrounding public on the dangers of trespassing on ranges and the hazards
      associated with UXO.

3.6. Command unique Missions
36                                                   AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008


     3.6.1. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC). Refer to PACAF mission guidelines for
     details (HQ PACAF/A7XOD, DSN 449-9483).
     3.6.2. Mortuary Affairs and Field Mortuary Response Teams (AMC). Refer to the Mortuary Support
     CONOP for details (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/DocView.asp?DocID=1113509).
     3.6.3. (Added-ACC) EOD support to Research, Test, and Development (RT&D) Agencies.
        3.6.3.1. (Added-ACC) EOD flights are frequently requested to provide support to other agencies
        for various test projects. Normal support consists of providing safe escort on ranges and disposal
        of explosive material upon conclusion of the test. The agency requesting EOD support must pro-
        vide funding, a test plan and coordinate requirements with the supporting EOD Flight. Agencies
        requesting EOD support on weapons ranges should coordinate requirements through the installa-
        tion’s Range Management Office. EOD flights will approve or disapprove the support request
        based on mission impact and personnel availability. The EOD Flight must coordinate test and
        safety plans through the installation’s wing safety office to the Air Combat Command (ACC)
        Weapons Safety Branch (HQ ACC/SEW) and to HQ ACC/A7XE, at least 30 days prior to the pro-
        jected/test date. HQ ACC/A7XE, in coordination with HQ ACC/SEW, will review and provide
        final approval of the EOD-related portion of the tests and safety plans.
        3.6.3.2. (Added-ACC) During Research, Test and Development missions, EOD flights may be
        requested to use equipment, supplies and demolition material not approved by the NNMSB and or
        do not have approved technical data. Flights must develop and submit operating instructions (OI)
        and safety/test plans to HQ ACC/A7XE at least 30 days prior to operations for approval. OI must
        contain information required by AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards.

3.7. Incident Command System
     3.7.1. AF Incident Management System (AFIMS).
     3.7.2. Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 directed the implementation the National
     Response Plan (NRP) through the National Incident Management System (NIMS). The Air Force
     chose to develop the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) for implementation of the
     NRP and the NIMS. In the AFIMS structure EOD falls under Emergency Support Function (ESF)
        3.7.2.1. The AFIMS replaces the Disaster Control Group and is outlined in AFI 10-2501, Air
        Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. All EOD managers and
        team leaders must be familiar with AFIMS.

3.8. Incident Reporting
     3.8.1. Service (ACES-EOD) Incident Reporting.
        3.8.1.1. Do not enter Restricted Data (RD) into the ACES-EOD Incident Report system. Refer to
        T.O. and paragraph numbers only.
        3.8.1.2. EOD Flights will use the ACES-EOD Operations Module, Incident Reporting System to
        gather and report information regarding EOD operations to their respective MAJCOMs. Flights
        submit incident reports within 5 working days after response termination (15 working days for
        EOD range clearance reports). The emergency status of the ACES-EOD report is category level
        two (C-2) and requires you to continue normal reporting during emergency conditions.
AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                  37


     3.8.1.3. Responding EOD teams will list the individual who positively identified the ordnance in
     the ACES-EOD incident report and the team chief will validate the identification. This process is
     accomplished using the drop down menus provided in the ACES-EOD System. If the team chief
     is the one who identifies the ordnance a different EOD technician will verify and be listed on the
     report (re: paragraph 3.1.1.1.).
     3.8.1.4. MAJCOM managers use ACES-EOD Incident Reports to analyze trends, identify defi-
     ciencies, plan training, and project future activities in all aspects of the EOD program. MAJCOMs
     will review and approve all ACES-EOD Incident Reports within 5 working days from date
     received from flights.
     3.8.1.5. Flights should avoid the use of “thermal treatment” and “disposal” (in relation to the
     emergency destruction of UXO and other hazardous explosive devices) in written EOD reports
     because the environmental interpretations of these terms have specific meaning and consequences
     under the RCRA that may impose additional requirements on the USAF.
     3.8.1.6. ACES-EOD shares response information (e.g., IED, post-blast, UXO, area clearance, etc)
     with the Joint Digital Information Gathering System (JDIGS) Program: this is covered in the
     ACES-EOD CONOP.
  3.8.2. SORTS Report. SORTS is reported IAW AFI 10-201.
     3.8.2.1. It is the EOD flight management’s responsibility to ensure manpower, equipment and
     training status is updated in SORTS, normally on a monthly basis in coordination with the Readi-
     ness Flight, or whenever significant changes occur.
     3.8.2.2. Since the results of individual flight SORTS reports are visible at the Joint Service level,
     input accuracy is critical for high level decision making.
     3.8.2.3. Descriptions should be detailed enough to identify what is missing/causing the rating,
     what needs to be done to fix or mitigate the problem, and a reasonable ECD.
  3.8.3. AEF Reporting Tool (ART).
     3.8.3.1. It is the EOD flight management’s responsibility to ensure ART accurately reflects status
     of UTCs. Review and make changes monthly or immediately when status changes. AEF Center
     and MAJCOM Functional Managers rely on the accuracy and currency of reporting to make criti-
     cal AEF sourcing decisions.
     3.8.3.1. (ACC) Units will provide status of each individual assigned to the Unit Type Code
     (UTC) IAW MISCAP Posturing. EXAMPLE: UTC 4FPXD LN001 is staff sergeant or senior air-
     man with availability status. LN002 is a technical sergeant with availability status.
        3.8.3.1.1. Code Green. Equipment – 100 percent of required equipment and vehicles are on
        hand. Personnel – All personnel are available/proficient with no rank/skill level substitutions.
        3.8.3.1.2. Code Yellow. Equipment – some equipment is missing but UTC can still accom-
        plish its mission. Personnel – All personnel are available/proficient using allowable rank/skill
        level substitutions. Note: If 3-level substitutions are used the comments will indicate that they
        have completed their CDCs and core 5-level tasks in the CFETP.
38                                                    AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008


            3.8.3.1.3. Code Red. Equipment – some or all of equipment is missing and the UTC cannot
            perform its mission. Personnel – Any position is vacant or any personnel lack proficiency per
            paragraph 1.8.2.
        3.8.3.2. All UTCs coded Yellow or Red will have comments explaining why their status is down-
        graded.

Section 3C—EOD Training

3.9. Overview. The Air Force EOD Training Program aims to produce professional, highly qualified,
technically proficient EOD teams capable of safely and efficiently performing peacetime and wartime
EOD missions. EOD proficiency training enables EOD teams to achieve and maintain a level of compe-
tency to safely and effectively deal with explosive hazards.
     3.9.1. Qualification Level. EOD team members must be trained to a knowledge level sufficient to
     determine and observe correct safety requirements needed before and during reconnaissance, and
     obtain the information necessary to positively identify ordnance items and formulate an appropriate
     render safe or disposal plan.
     3.9.2. Need for Practical Training. Hands-on practical training is necessary for required proficiency.
     EOD team members meet acceptable performance standards, with the aid of applicable publications,
     by correctly performing EOD procedures without committing errors that degrade safety and risk
     injury.

3.10. Responsibilities:
     3.10.1. HQ AFCESA/CEXD:
        3.10.1.1. Submits MAJCOM inputs to the EOD Standard Training Package.
        3.10.1.2. Oversees the development, updating, and publishing of the CFETP and Specialty Train-
        ing Standard.
     3.10.2. MAJCOMs:
        3.10.2.1. Recommend subject and task material in writing to HQ AFCESA/CEXD.
        3.10.2.2. Set up procedures to schedule, complete, and document training requirements.
        3.10.2.3. Request and manage quotas for EOD formal training courses.
        3.10.2.4. Monitor personnel attendance to ensure maximum course use and prevent lapses in indi-
        vidual certifications.
        3.10.2.5. Supplement the CFETP to include MAJCOM-unique requirements.
     3.10.3. EOD Flights.
        3.10.3.1. Ensure deploying Airmen have completed all requirements per paragraph 3.4.4.
            3.10.3.1.1. An EOD Apprentice (AF Specialty Code (AFSC) 3E831) is not deployment-eligi-
            ble unless they have completed all volumes of their Career Development Courses (CDC) and
            the end-of-course (EOC) test, and have been trained and certified on 100-percent of core task
            items in the Career Field Education Training Plan (CFETP).
AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                    39


           3.10.3.1.2. EOD Officers initial qualification training includes IJQS for standby, equipment
           issue and familiarization, EOD flight operations, all CAT 1 and CAT 2 requirements, all ancil-
           lary training, AFIT EOD Flight Management Course (or a MAJCOM orientation liaison), and
           selected reading as deemed necessary by the MAJCOM and local unit commanders.
           3.10.3.1.2. (ACC) Officers are highly encouraged to complete Career Development Course
           3E851; Battle Staff Smart book; Emergency Response to Terrorism Computer Based Training
           (CBT); and review Joint Pub 3.0; MTTP 3-2.32, EOD in a Joint Environment, and applicable
           portions of the War Mobilization Plan (WMP).
       3.10.3.2. Schedule, conduct, and document all required and optional training. Note: EOD profi-
       ciency training duplicates most CBRNE Defense course material. EOD personnel need to receive
       CBRNE Defense training only on CBRNE threat-specific defense procedures.
       3.10.3.3. Ensure that Airmen recently graduated from the Naval EOD Basic Course dedicate
       daily study-time to complete CDCs. Note: EOD-qualified officers are highly encouraged to com-
       plete the EOD CDC course.
       3.10.3.4. Flight management must evaluate members returning from extended deployments (e.g.,
       179-day and longer) to ensure member’s proficiency on core tasks listed in the CFETP and IJQS
       are still current. If recertifications on certain tasks are required, follow documentation procedures
       listed in the CFETP. Annotate AF IMT 623a, On the Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, in
       the AFTR that this review was accomplished.
       3.10.3.5. (Added-ACC) Manning Assistance Training. This training consists of practical or
       classroom training necessary to prepare an individual to perform required EOD duties at a Tempo-
       rary Duty (TDY) location.
       3.10.3.6. (Added-ACC) Ensure a comprehensive training program is in effect and training prior-
       ities are clearly defined. Wartime, as well as peacetime tasks must be continually taught, exercised
       and evaluated to ensure the highest level of competency.
           3.10.3.6.1. (Added-ACC) EOD training will be prioritized above normal day-to-day work
           activities. Only EOD operations; i.e., incident responses, range clearances, VIPPSA missions,
           etc. will receive a higher priority than training.
           3.10.3.6.2. (Added-ACC) TDY manning assistance personnel will participate in the recur-
           ring training given at the TDY location to the greatest extent possible. The person's TDY
           supervisor or the flight training noncommissioned officer will record all training received by
           the individual at the TDY location.
           3.10.3.6.3. (Added-ACC) Ensure all members receive an initial evaluation within 60 days of
           assignment to the EOD flight and are task qualified on all locally supported munitions and pro-
           cedures and placed on standby duty within 120 days. If additional time is required, contact HQ
           ACC/A7XE with rationale and document in the individuals AF Form 623a. EXCEPTION:
           Direct support nuclear units are allowed 180 days maximum to place an individual on standby
           duty.

3.11. Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) 3E8X1. The CFETP 3E8X1 is a compre-
hensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements,
training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the EOD career field.

     3.11.1. Group I – Monthly Qualification Training. Training or operations using cartridge-actuated
     tools, demolition explosives, or pyrotechnic devices to perform render-safe procedures (RSP) or gen-
     eral demolition.
        3.11.1.1. Monthly use of live explosives is required for EOD qualification of Hazardous Duty
        Incentive Pay (HDIP) for demolition duty in accordance with DoD Financial Management Regu-
        lation, Volume 7a, (chapter 24, section 2404).
            3.11.1.1.1. Either training (per paragraph 3.11.1.) or actual explosives operations (e.g., emer-
            gency responses, combat operations, experimentation & testing, munitions disposal, etc) fulfill
            the requirement for HDIP for demolition duty, as long as live explosives are used.
            3.11.1.1.2. Document HDIP monthly qualifications on AF IMT 623a (or similar form) in the
            AFTR. Maintain HDIP qualification records with other EOD proficiency records for 24
            months per AFRIMS Table 36-38, Rule 10.
            3.11.1.1.3. (Added-ACC) Personnel who Permanent Change of Station (PCS) to a flight after
            the start of the calendar year training cycle do not require waivers or make-up training for pre-
            viously scheduled classes and exercises.
        3.11.1.2. Waivers.
            3.11.1.2.1. During periods of deployments and at locations where monthly qualification for
            Demolition Pay is not possible due to political, fiscal, or contingency reasons, personnel may
            be temporarily waived from this requirement (re: paragraph 1.8.5.2).
            3.11.1.2.2. EOD Flights must validate, through the deployed/installation commander that no
            type of explosives operations may be performed (including explosive-operated tools) for the
            purpose of qualification proficiency training. Personnel will maintain a copy of the validated
            waiver with their individual training records.
        3.11.1.3. EOD Flight management will ensure the finance office is notified when a member fails
        to perform the monthly demolition duty required for entitlement to HDIP (unless waived per para-
        graph 3.1.1.2.).
     3.11.2. Group II – Semiannual Training Requirements. Classroom instruction and practical
     (hands-on) training for team members. During the classroom training tools are assembled, unique fea-
     tures and safety precautions briefed, and equipment applications and limitations discussed. Classroom
     instruction on procedures should coincide with Group IV practical exercises.
     3.11.3. Group III – Annual Training Requirements. Annual classroom training on ordnance, tools and
     EOD techniques.
     3.11.4. Group IV – Practical Training and Exercise Requirements. Team exercises allow members to
     apply classroom knowledge to formulate plans, select and use the proper equipment, manage person-
     nel, and direct operations to resolve incidents or accidents involving EO.
        3.11.4.1. (Added-ACC) Not all personnel are required to physically take part in every practical
        training operation to satisfy minimum training requirements. Participation as an observer, instruc-
        tor, evaluator, or participant will meet these needs.
        3.11.4.2. (Added-ACC) Use the standards outlined in paragraph 3.20. (Added) to develop and
        conduct practical exercises. Develop each scenario so as many of the required actions in the exer-
AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                               41


      cise standards can be performed. Hold simulations to an absolute minimum. Demonstrate any
      actions not performed afterwards.
      3.11.4.3. (Added-ACC) One of the two IED exercises will include a WMD threat scenario.
      Ensure your training documentation differentiates between the IED and WMD exercise.
   3.11.5. Group V – Supplementary Training. Ancillary or other specialized training is required by
   directive to perform general or specific additional military duties.
   3.11.6. (Added-ACC) Annual training report (ATR) must be printed and posted in the training folder
   every six months (June and December).

3.12. Flight Master Training Plan
   3.12.1. Home Station Emergency Response (Stand-by). Flights will develop and use the Initial Job
   Qualification Standard (IJQS) to train and document home-station specific qualifications required to
   perform EOD standby duties. IJQS will include: committed aerospace platforms and munitions; safety
   programs; protective equipment; and installation response plans as a minimum.
   3.12.1. (ACC) Home Station Emergency Response (Stand-by). ACC EOD flights will develop and
   maintain a Master Training Plan (MTP). The flight leader must review the MTP at least annually,
   update as necessary and sign a new MTP cover letter. The MTP cover letter must address training
   standards, how and when classes are presented, technical order/publication review program, Monthly
   ACES-EOD familiarization, documentation of training and make-up training requirements. Ensure
   the MTP includes the following:
      3.12.1.1. (Added-ACC) A written description of type and frequency of all flight training.
      3.12.1.2. (Added-ACC) The annual schedule.
      3.12.1.3. (Added-ACC) All duty related tasks.

      3.12.1.5. (Added-ACC) Practical exercise schedule.
      3.12.1.6. (Added-ACC) Ancillary training required.
      3.12.1.7. (Added-ACC) In-processing checklist that covers newly arriving members.
   3.12.2. Unit-Committed Munitions Listing (UCML). Flights use the UCML to build training require-
   ments.
      3.12.2.1. UCML can be obtained from the installation Munitions Accountable Supply Officer
      (MASO).
      3.12.2.2. Use the UCML as a basis for the Master Training Plan, and as a guide for obtaining
      munitions training aids.
   3.12.3. Contingency training requirements.
      3.12.3.1. Accomplish Prime BEEF requirements Category 1, 2, 3, & 4 training (i.e., Law of
      Armed Conflict, Bivouac, Use of Force, etc) in accordance with AFI 10-210.
      3.12.3.2. Pre-deployment requirements. HAF/A7CX and HQ AFCESA CEXD collaborate with
      AFFOR commanders and other services to determine these requirements. This type of training is

        fluid and requirements are difficult to forecast. As of this publication, EOD personnel are required
        to attend CST and GATOR…future requirements may include Joint Service pre-deployment train-
        ing and Common Battlefield Airman Training (CBAT) qualifications.
     3.12.4. AFOSH and OSHA training requirements (AF IMT 55, Employee Safety and Health Record
     8).
        3.12.4.1. Document all ancillary training on the AF IMT 55. Flights will use the AF EOD stan-
        dard AF IMT 55 as a template (available from the EOD Management CoP).
        3.12.4.2. HQ AFCESA will provide a standard AF IMT 55 for MAJCOMs to add command- and
        installation-unique items. MAJCOMs and flights will supplement standard AF IMT 55 as neces-
        sary.
     3.12.5. Nuclear Weapons Training.
        3.12.5.1. All flights train on core nuclear tasks per 3E8X1 CFETP. Training consists of at least the
        following (See paragraph 3.5.4.):
           3.12.5.1.1. Annual classroom training on all active DoD systems (as a minimum using TO
           60N-60-1and 60N-60-6).
           3.12.5.1.2. One annual Broken Arrow exercise (should be practical, but may be ‘table-top’
           when necessary).
           3.12.5.1.2. (ACC) Ensure training incorporates the full spectrum of weapon recovery activi-
           ties up to the point that the weapon is stabilized and area can safely withstand the wait for fol-
           low-on forces. NOTE: Participation in multi-service nuclear exercises (e.g. Direct Focus),
           national level nuclear exercises (e.g. Digit Pace) or evaluations/staff assistance visits by
           Inspector General (IG) or HQ ACC/A7XE fulfills the requirement for practical training. Doc-
           ument exercise in the individuals training record.
        3.12.5.2. At AF EOD flights that provide direct nuclear support, personnel are trained to perform
        all necessary EOD actions from weapon stabilization to weapon recovery.
           3.12.5.2.1. EOD personnel train on EOD nuclear procedures including, as a minimum, render
           safe procedures, continuation procedures, and component recovery tasks (identify and recover
           without violating warnings or safety precautions relating to all hazards).
           3.12.5.2.2. EOD training on direct-supported systems consists of semi-annual classroom and
           annual practical training. Training on DoD systems not directly supported is per paragraph
           3.12.5.1.1. above. One annual Broken Arrow exercise will involve at least one direct-sup-
           ported system.
        3.12.5.3. Type 3A/C trainers used exclusively for EOD training will be maintained in a WR con-
        figuration but may deviate from WR standards with Unsatisfactory Report (UR) approval. For
        those trainers not on the weapons maintenance account, the MUNS/MOO and owning agency
        (EOD flight) will work out a periodic inspection and maintenance schedule to fix deficiencies in
        order to keep the trainers in WR configuration, IAW AFI 21-204.
        3.12.5.4. (Added-ACC) Personnel maintain certification by performing annual practical training
        to include as a minimum; weapon system render safe, continuation, demonstrate or discuss com-
        ponent recovery, and receive a rating of “Certified” on an evaluated annual Broken Arrow opera-
AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                  43


      tion. EOD members of any MAJCOM inspection or staff assistance visit team may decertify

                                         LOGISTICS / A4

4.1. Overview. The ESLs identifies Base Support and EOD mobility equipment required to support
home-station, contingency, and operational plans. HQ AFCESA/CEXD publishes and distributes to MAJ-
COMs for implementation. MAJCOMs must use this document when determining equipment require-
ments for their flights. The mobility ESLs identifies SORTS reportable equipment.

4.2. Equipment Supply Listings (ESL). MAJCOMs must adhere to the ESL requirements to standard-
ize equipment throughout the Air Force EOD program. To ensure standardization of EOD equipment and
supplies, recommended changes to any part of the ESL must have the concurrence of EOD Equipment
Working Group members and be approved by HQ AFCESACEXD (up to the monetary limits set by the
CERB). Major ESL changes (those which modify the capability of a UTC) should be reviewed by the
EODP (out-of-cycle if necessary). The EODP can request the EWG to readdress an ESL issue. ESLs are
available on the AF EOD Program Management CoP at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/Entry-
CoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-CE-49.
   4.2.1. Accountability. Individuals must maintain and protect all items issued to them. When reas-
   signed, issued personal equipment accompanies the individual as professional equipment. The losing
   flight must forward one copy of the individual's AF IMT 538 or a computer-generated form to the
   gaining flight to ensure accountability. The individual must hand carry one copy. Note: Active duty
   and ARC will conduct transfers within their respective Program Element Codes.
   4.2.2. ESL Updates. MAJCOMs provide an updated equipment spreadsheet to HQ AFCESA/CEXD
   semiannually (October and May). HQ AFCESA/CEXD consolidates MAJCOM inputs for use during
   the POM Build and Munitions Buy Budget process. All items on the ESL with an allowance source
   code will be placed on the CA-CRL (R-14) per AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, chapter 22.
   4.2.2. (ACC) ESL Updates. Report any excess EOD equipment to HQ ACC/A7XE for possible
   redistribution.
   4.2.3. Allowance Source Codes (ASC). ASCs are identified on each ESL for equipment items.
   4.2.4. Unit Supply Accounts. EOD Flights must maintain an equipment, munitions, supply, and
   weapons accounts in accordance with Air Force guidance and local directives.
   4.2.5. (Added-ACC) Personal Equipment. Flights will budget for a minimum of 10% of funded posi-
   tions for personal retention gear annually. The flight must develop a prioritized personal equipment
   requirement listing for new personnel arriving from EOD School.

                                                 Chapter 5

                          STRATEGIC PLANS AND REQUIREMENTS / A5

5.1. Air Force Deliberate Planning.
     5.1.1. USAF War Mobilization Plan (WMP). The WMP is discussed in AFMAN 10-401, Opera-
     tional Plan and Concept Plan Development and Implementation. The WMP is the principle AF docu-
     ment that feeds the joint-service planning system – specifically, the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan
     (JSCP). The WMP is a five-volume Air Force document that provides Air Staff and USAF command-
     ers with current policies, forces, and planning factors for conducting and supporting wartime opera-
     tions. Volume 1 (WMP-1) is important for flights: WMP-1, Annex S, Appendix 9 outlines EOD
     wartime posturing, capability, and deliberate planning for worst-case scenarios. Flight managers
     should be familiar with EOD capabilities and the deliberate planning factors. Flights comply with
     paragraph 1.2.7. of this instruction to ensure correct UTC data is available for loading in the TPFDD
     libraries.
        5.1.1.1. WMP-3, Part 2, is the list of combat and support forces, by UTC and location, available
        to the war-planners and combatant commanders. Flights comply with paragraph 1.2.8. of this
        instruction to ensure correctness of WMP-3, Part 2.
     5.1.2. DOC-Taskings. DOC-Taskings outline which OPlan flights are attached to, and the UTCs they
     are required to posture (as well as SORTS and ART reporting requirements).

5.2. Wing/Installation Contingency and Support Plans.
     5.2.1. Review Plans. Review Wing/Installation Contingency and Support Plans annually. These plans
     are normally available through Wing Plans (XP or A5) office.
     5.2.2. Garrison Expeditionary Support Plans (GESP). Every base has this plan. Ensure EOD require-
     ments are listed in this plan. It explains the Ready Augmentee Program requirements, vehicle needs,
     and other parameters of support.
     5.2.3. Emergency Management (EM) Planning. EM planning is covered in AFI 10-2501, Air Force
     Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. EOD flights use EM planning in
     addition to the EOD mission CONOPs to assist in developing team chief guides for emergency
     response.

5.3. Plan Sourcing Procedures.
     5.3.1. UTC Availability. EOD flight chief in conjunction with the Unit Deployment Manager (UDM)
     will update ART and SORTS in accordance with local procedures and AFI 10-210.
     5.3.2. Deployed TOs. Deployed teams must coordinate with theater EOD functional with the number
     of TO sets dispatched so TO distribution can be identified at the deployed base. Gaining MAJCOMs
     will coordinate with Detachment 63 and HQ AFCESA/CEXD so that the deployed team can receive a
     new TODO account. HQ AFCESA will establish a new flight within ACES EOD.
AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                  57

                             SIGNAL AND COMMUNICATIONS / A6

6.1. Home station LMR requirements. In addition to a dedicated EOD net, EOD Flights will have
access to a minimum of the following radio nets: airfield control tower, fire/crash, CE, Security Forces,
and supported ranges (as required).

6.2. Tactical communications. These requirements are listed in the EOD ESL.

6.3. COMSEC. EOD flights must have COMSEC accounts for management of secure communications
and navigational AIDS.

6.4. Satellite Communications. Prior to acquisition, coordinate satellite communications terminal pur-
chases with MAJCOM EOD functional management, HQ AFCESA/CEXD, and the local communica-
tions squadron to ensure equipment interoperability, frequency approval, downlink support and satellite
service access/availability.

6.5. Frequency Management. Flights and MAJCOMs must obtain radio frequency assignment for EOD
electronic tools (e.g., Counter Radio-controlled IED Electronic Warfare (CREW) devices, robots, remote
firing devices, x-ray devices, etc) from base level spectrum manager or the Air Force Frequency Manage-
ment Agency (AFFMA) (DoDD 4650.1, Policy for Management and Use of the Electromagnetic Spec-
trum, and AFMAN 33-120, Electromagnetic Spectrum Management).
   6.5.1. Even if EOD electronic tools have prior joint-service or Air Force spectrum certification,
   flights must coordinate local equipment spectrum certification prior to equipment being placed in
   operation using DD Form 1494, Application for Equipment Frequency Allocation.5 Be sure to plan for
   foreign frequency authorizations for potential forward deployed locations.
   6.5.2. Use of electronic attack equipment (e.g. CREW) requires frequency assignment for training,
   testing, and exercises. Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual (CJCSM) 3212.02B, Performing Elec-
   tronic Attack in the United States and Canada for Tests, Training, and Exercises, is the official guid-
   ance for frequency clearance procedures for performing electronic attack.




5. The requirement and application instructions for spectrum supportability of CREW devices are in the
Joint IED Defeat Office (JIEDDO) Director’s Policy Letter #10, Submission of DD Form 1494,
Application for Equipment Frequency Allocation, 16 Oct 06, available through the installation spectrum
manager from AFFMA/XP.

     7.1.4. Special Features. The EOD facility must meet requirements for storage of hazardous and
     explosive materials, classified information, and firearms according to DoD 6055.9-STD, DoD Explo-
     sives Safety Standards, AFMAN 91-201, Air Force Explosives Safety Standards and other federal,
     state, and local laws. EOD facilities will maintain a SIPRNET/Secure Telephone Equipment (STE);
AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                        59


   Fax; DSN/Commercial/Fax lines; and LMR (base stations). Mobility and other flight general-purpose
   vehicles will be stored in a secure fenced in, covered, and lighted area. Equipment load out areas will
   also have sufficient lighting for safe load out of equipment. The EOD Proficiency training range is
   required under category code 831-173. Explosives will be stored according to DoD 6055.9-STD and
   AFMAN 91-201.

Section 7B—Federal and Civil Support

7.2. Installation Support to Off-Base EOD Response. As outlined in DoDD 2000.13, Civil Affairs,
this section provides EOD guidance to meet the life sustaining needs of the civilian population and pro-
vide expertise to restore civilian sector functions.
   7.2.1. Support Staff. The installation commander or designee, a Public Affairs representative, and a
   JA representative should accompany the EOD team to the location of the incident. However, emer-
   gency responses to potentially life-threatening emergencies will not be delayed awaiting legal reviews
   or unified media responses.
       7.2.1.1. The commander may designate the senior EOD team member as his representative pend-
       ing determination of the need for additional support.
       7.2.1.2. The PA and JA representatives may be in “on-call” status pending determination of the
       need for additional support.
   7.2.2. Risk Category. An incident risk category is assigned per AFJI-32-3002, Interservice Responsi-
   bilities for EOD. Commanders must limit exposure of EOD personnel to risk of injury or loss of life
   unless the critical nature of the threat to the civilian population clearly justifies the risk. Base the risk
   decision on a joint assessment of the incident by the senior EOD representative and the on-scene com-
   mander.
   7.2.3. Response Parameters. See details for responding to military ordnance and to non-military
   devices/explosives in paragraph 3.1.4.

7.3. EOD Assistance to Civil authorities.
   7.3.1. Directive Authority. This section provides guidance for emergency EOD response to hazard-
   ous explosives, or explosive devices, that threaten the civil populace, authorizing installation com-
   manders, on request from civil authorities, to provide EOD assistance per the following conditions:
       7.3.1.1. All off-installation EOD emergency responses in support of civil authorities are initially
       treated as “immediate response” requests under DoD Directives 3025.1, Military Support to Civil
       Authorities (MSCA) and 3025.15, Military Assistance to Civil Authorities until an on-site EOD
       assessment of the situation determines otherwise.
       7.3.1.2. As soon as practical, the particulars of the support to civil authorities (see paragraph
       3.1.4.) will be provided, through command post channels, to the National Military Command Cen-
       ter (NMCC).
       7.3.1.3. All MSCA response activities will be conducted in accordance with AFPD 10-8, Home-
       land Defense and Civil Support, and AFI 10-802, Military Support to Civil Authorities.
   7.3.2. Reimbursement of civil EOD support. Flights will coordinate with their installation legal office
   and financial management/comptroller to build a list of expenses that are eligible for reimbursement
60                                                  AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008


     and clarify when reimbursement for EOD support should be billed to civil authorities (e.g., loss of
     military specialized equipment, travel/per-diem costs, and/or military man-hours). Reimbursement
     applies only for response actions to non-military munitions. Emergency EOD support will not be
     withheld due to lack of reimbursement. Flights will also:
        7.3.2.1. Maintain logs of expenses incurred and resources expended when providing support to
        civil authorities.
        7.3.2.2. Report all MSCA support to their local Command Post and Comptroller.
        7.3.2.3. Work with their local Comptroller to develop procedures to seek reimbursement for EOD
        support provided to local and federal civil authorities.
AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                61


                                              Chapter 8

                     PROGRAMS AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT / A8

8.1. Civil Engineer Financial Planning and Budgeting.
   8.1.1. Program Planning – Facility Operations Model (FOM). AFI 32-10140, Programming and Bud-
   geting Appropriated Funded Facilities Operation Requirements, implements the programming and
   budgeting appropriated funded facilities operation requirements.
   8.1.2. The FOM outlines and formats Active Duty operational budgetary requirements. It identifies
   major program entities for each EOD flight’s funding (i.e., personnel authorized, equipment UTCs,
   flights, mission parameters, etc) for forecasting purposes.
       8.1.2.1. EOD flights provide changes to the FOM per local requirements with info copy to their
       MAJCOM functional manager:
          8.1.2.1.1. MAJCOMs will consolidate flight data and report all changes to established pro-
          grams (such as changes in DOC-tasked UTCs, authorized manning, or mission changes) to
          AFCESA annually after budget submission.
          8.1.2.1.2. Identify recurring unique requirements not covered in standard AF EOD missions
          for addition in the FOM.
       8.1.2.2. HQ AFCESA/CEXD will maintain the FOM model and be the Air Force focal point for
       inputting all EOD flight requirements.
   8.1.3. Budget Forecasting. Flights will use available financial management tools to forecast budgets.
   Flights should use a three-year historical basis to average and track expenditures. Note: Factor USSS
   support based on either election or non-election year averages, as applicable.

8.2. Cost Center Management (Budgets). Flight managers must prepare flight budgets, ensure require-
ments are incorporated into the parent flight budget, monitor funds expenditure through the year, and
request additional funds when needed. Close coordination with squadron Resources Managers and own-
ing MAJCOM EOD staff is critical in an effective Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution
(PPBE) process.

                                                Chapter 9

                  ASSESSMENTS, LESSONS LEARNED, AND EXERCISES / A9

9.1. Lessons Learned (LLs) Tracking. All levels of command may report lessons learned. After Action
Reports are normally completed at deployed location or within 30 days after completion of an operation.
     9.1.1. Submitting LLs. A person or flight having LLs provides the issues in writing to the contin-
     gency theater headquarters staff and to the parent MAJCOM EOD Staff for review and consolidation,
     ensuring there is no redundancy in the Joint Universal Lessons Learned System (JULLS). . MAJ-
     COMs forward LLs to HQ AFCESA for presentation to the EOD Panel (EODP), or out-of-cycle
     EODP review if necessary.
     9.1.2. EODP Actions. The EODP will discuss and determine if the LLs warrant the expenditure of
     resources. If the EODP accepts/approves the LLs, they are linked to EODP Action Items for tracking
     and resolution.
     9.1.3. HQ AFCESA Actions. CEXD uses a Lessons Learned (LL) database to track LL until the
     ACES EOD LL Module becomes available. Manage the ACES EOD LL IAW the ACES EOD
     CONOP and ACES Users Manual.

9.2. EODP Action Item Process.
     9.2.1. Submitting Action Items.
        9.2.1.1. Any EOD technician, flight, or agency having a proposal to bring before EODP must
        have MAJCOM EOD staff review and sponsorship for the proposal.
        9.2.1.2. The EODP is the first level for AF-level issues and recommendations affecting the AF
        EOD career field. A proposal brought before the EODP must be done in compliance with the
        EODP charter.
     9.2.2. Processing Action Items.
        9.2.2.1. The EODP will discuss and determine if the proposal warrants the expenditure of
        resources. The EODP takes appropriate action after the proposal is voted on (e.g., create an action
        item).
        9.2.2.2. Each EODP action item is assigned an OPR, and actions toward completion are tracked
        in a HQ AFCESA/CEXD database. The data base is updated and managed throughout the year
        and scrubbed semi-annually during EODP meetings. Action Items are incorporated into the AF
        EOD Business Plan when appropriate.
        9.2.2.3. Action items involving CE policy or funding issues may require review and approval by
        the Civil Engineer Readiness Board (CERB) or the Civil Engineer Readiness Council (CERC).

9.3. Exercise Support and Planning.
     9.3.1. Home-Station Support. EOD flights should provide an additional duty member to the installa-
     tion exercise evaluation team.
     9.3.2. EOD Support to Deployed Exercises. Unless on-site USAF EOD support is available at the
     exercise locations, MAJCOMs must provide EOD teams to support all aircraft deployment exercises
AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                              63


   when munitions are used. On-site USAF EOD support is necessary to provide safe and timely support
   for aircraft and munitions operations. Note: EOD from other US service components may be
   employed after a commander’s multi-functional ORM assessment and approval. In such cases, com-
   manders should obtain, in advance, a documented memorandum of agreement for dedicated support
   to the Air Force exercise.

9.4. Quality Assurance (QA). All EOD flights will have some form of QA program. For example,
smaller EOD flights may choose to adopt the parent squadron/wing program but flights (especially those
larger than 20 authorized personnel) are encouraged to have an in-flight program with a dedicated QA
person/section.

                    MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU)
                                   BETWEEN
                    {INSERT BASE NAME} AIR FORCE BASE AND
         {INSERT STATE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY TITLE}
Parties: The parties to this MOU are {INSERT BASE NAME} Air Force Base a Department of Defense
(DoD) military organization located at {INSERT BASE NAME}, {INSERT STATE} and the{INSERT
STATE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY TITLE}.
Background:
       DoD Component military organizations have personnel specially trained to handle all types of
       explosives, including improvised explosive devices. Other Federal agencies request assistance
       from DoD Component Commander in emergencies involving explosives. These situations call for
       immediate action to abate the safety threat by treatment in place or removal to a safe location for
       treatment.
       U.S. EPA’s Military Munitions Rule (MR) (62 FR 6622, Feb. 12, 1997) makes it clear that EOD
       personnel engaged in an explosives or munitions emergency response are exempt from the
       generator, transporter, treatment, storage, and disposal unit requirements of the Solid Waste
       Disposal Act (42 USC Sec 6901, et seq.). The standards the MR established govern this MOU,
       whether the Federal or state government is administering the MR or the Solid Waste Act, in whole
       or part.
       Except for providing temporary storage or treatment of explosives to provide emergency life
       saving assistance to civilian authorities or to assist law enforcement agencies per established
       agreements between DOD and the Federal agency concerned, the DOD is prohibited by law (10
       USC 2692) from using DOD installations for the storage or treatment of non-DOD owned
       hazardous materials.
Purpose: This MOU, which addresses the roles and responsibilities of all parties regarding notification
responsibilities during emergency response operations, is intended to:
       Minimize the risk to public safety from the DoD Component EOD operations.
       Maximize the efficiency, safety, and speed of any explosives treatment or retrieval operation.
       Establish a framework for mutual assistance and consultation among the parties with respect to
       Component EOD explosives or munitions emergency response operations
Scope: This MOU applies to DoD Component EOD explosives or munitions response operations.


Definitions:
       Explosives or Munitions Emergency. A situation, which involves the suspected or detected
       presence of unexploded ordnance (UXO), damaged or deteriorated explosives or munitions,
       improvised explosive device (IED) post rendered-safe hazardous components, other potentially
       explosive material or devices, or other potentially harmful military munitions or devices, that
       creates an actual or potential imminent threat to human health, to include public safety, or the
AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008                                                                77


     environment, to include property, as determined by an EOD specialist. The EOD specialist may
     determine that such situations require immediate and expeditious action to control, mitigate, or
     eliminate the threat.
     Explosives or Munitions Emergency Response. All immediate response activities by an EOD
     response specialist to control, mitigate, or eliminate the actual or potential threat encountered
     during an explosive or munitions emergency. An explosives or munitions emergency response
     may include in-place render safe procedures, treatment or destruction of the explosives or
     munitions or the transport of the items to another location to be rendered safe, treated, or
     destroyed. Any reasonable delay in the completion of an explosives or munitions emergency
     response caused by a necessary, unforeseen, or uncontrollable circumstance does not terminate the
     explosives or munitions emergency response. Explosives or munitions emergency response can
     occur on either private or public lands and are not limited to responses to RCRA facilities. There
     are two types of explosives or munitions emergency responses:
            Level 1 Response. Immediate response to situations where explosives or munitions are not
            properly secured or under military control if military munitions and thus threaten or
            potentially threaten human health and safety, the environment, or property. When
            extenuating circumstances exist, e.g., adverse weather, nightfall, or safety considerations,
            delay actions necessary to terminate an explosives or munitions emergency, the response
            will be delayed until the necessary action(s) can be accomplished. EOD or Technical
            Escort Unit (TEU) personnel must ensure explosives or munitions are in a safe and secure
            environment.
            Level 2 Response. Response actions to situations involving explosives or munitions which
            pose an imminent and substantial danger to human health and safety, the environment, or
            property, but for which response actions may be temporarily delayed without
            compromising safety or increasing risk. When EOD or TEU support is not required during
            a Level 2 response, qualified personnel, such as weapons officers, ammunition handlers,
            and trained and certified DoD contractors may conduct Level 2 responses, or as directed.
            In such cases, time may allow for an emergency permit to be obtained. The parties
            acknowledge that explosives or munitions emergencies present unique facts and
            circumstances and must therefore be evaluated case-by-case. In the absence of full and
            complete information, which frequently occurs when notice of an explosive or munitions
            emergency is received and first responded to, emergency response specialists, based on
            their knowledge, training, and experience, must use their best judgment in assessing risk.
            It is therefore to be expected that as the response to anexplosive or munitions emergency
            progresses, a Level 1 response may become a Level 2 response and vice versa.
     Explosive or Munitions Emergency Response Specialist. Personnel trained in the identification,
     handling, treatment, transport, and destruction of explosives or chemical and conventional
     munitions. Explosives or munitions emergency response specialists include DoD EOD personnel
     who are trained to responds to emergency situations involving military munitions and explosives;
     DoD Technical Escort Unit (TEU) personnel who are trained to respond to chemical munitions
     emergencies; and DOE, National Guard, and Coast Guard specialists who are trained to respond to
     chemical munitions emergencies. EOD and TEU personnel respond to on-installation and
     off-installation incidents involving military munitions. They also respond to request by other
     Federal agencies or local civil authorities for assistance with incidents involving non-military
78                                                    AFI32-3001_ACCSUP_I 29 SEPTEMBER 2008


       explosives with component commander approval. DoD certified civilian or contractor personnel;
       and other Federal, State, or local government, or civilian personnel similarly trained in explosives
       or munitions emergency responses are also included.
       Military Munitions. Per Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 260.10, Hazardous Waste
       Management System, General, Sub Part B, Definitions; all ammunition products and components
       produced or used by or for DoD or the U.S. Armed Services for national defense and security,
       including military munitions under the control of the Department of Defense, the U.S. Coast
       Guard, the U.S. Department of Energy, and National Guard personnel. The term military
       munitions:
              Includes: Confined gaseous, liquid, and solid propellants, explosives, pyrotechnics,
              chemical and riot control agents, smokes, and incendiaries used by DoD Components,
              including bulk explosives and chemical warfare agents, chemical munitions, rockets,
              guided and ballistic missiles, bombs, warheads, mortar rounds, artillery ammunition, small
              arms ammunition, grenades, mines, torpedoes, depth charges, cluster munitions and
              dispensers, demolition charges, and devices and any components of such.
              Does not include: wholly inert items, improvised explosive devices, and nuclear weapons,
              devices, and components of such.
              However, it does include non-nuclear components of nuclear devices, managed under
              DOE’s nuclear weapons program after all required sanitization operations under the
              Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, have been completed.
