This instruction implements AFPD 32-60, Housing. It prescribes policies and procedures for random
health, morale, and safety dormitory inspections of unaccompanied enlisted military dormitories. This
instruction applies to all dormitories on Travis Air Force Base.



1. OBJECTIVE:
   1.1. Provides general guidelines for conducting random health, morale, and safety dorm inspections.
   An inspection is defined as an examination of a person, property, or premises for the primary purpose
   of ensuring the security, military fitness, and/or good order and discipline of the organization or instal-
   lation. The goals of dormitory inspections are to ensure the dormitory is in good order, no damage to
   government property, no violation of dorm instructions, and no illegal contraband is stored in the dor-
   mitory.
   1.2. Distinction between Inspection and Search:
       1.2.1. Inspection: a tool used by a commander to determine and ensure the security, military fit-
       ness, or good order and discipline of the unit. It may include such purposes as determining the unit
       is properly equipped, maintaining proper standards of readiness, sanitation, cleanliness, and that
       personnel are present, fit and ready for duty, according to the Rules of Military Evidence 313(b).
       1.2.2. Search: any governmental intrusion or quest for incriminating evidence into an area in
       which an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy; Katz vs United States, 389, U.S. 347
       (1967).

2. RESPONSIBILITIES:
   2.1. Wing Commander:
       2.1.1. Will ensure all health, safety, and morale dorm inspections are selected on a random basis

       dormitory for inspection. All dormitories are subject to the random selection including dorms pre-
       viously selected.
    2.2. Command Chief (CCM):
       2.2.1. Will notify/coordinate with applicable agencies to include first sergeants, commander(s) of
       selected dorm, Security Forces, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Demand Reduction
       Office and Legal Office.
       2.2.2. Will detail first sergeants to provide Senior Noncommissioned Officers (SNCOs) to serve
       as monitors/observers.
    2.3. Squadron Commanders/First Sergeants of inspected dormitory:
       2.3.1. Will have an inspection kit readily available containing disposable gloves, paper bags, mas-
       ter keys, dorm roster reflecting date of birth, dorm layout with tentative areas designated for
       inspectors/perimeter monitors, magic markers, pens, stapler, and clipboards.
    2.4. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) and Security Forces (SF) Investiga-
    tions:
       2.4.1. AFOSI and SF personnel will serve primarily as advisors to the first sergeants/inspectors.
       2.4.2. AFOSI or SF personnel will be assigned to each dorm floor. Inspections should direct all
       questions/concerns about potential contraband to AFOSI or SF assigned to that floor.
       2.4.3. AFOSI and SF personnel do not inspect rooms. If questionable items are discovered, they
       will search the room, as required, based on probable cause.
       2.4.4. AFOSI and SF personnel will coordinate with JA personnel to determine probable cause as
       required.
       2.4.5. AFOSI and SF personnel will NOT conduct investigations regarding underage drinking or
       possession, wrongful cohabitation, or adultery. The squadron commander/first sergeant will han-
       dle these matters.
       2.4.6. SF personnel will assist in obtaining a blood alcohol content on an individual if requested
       by the commander/first sergeant.
       2.4.7. SF or AFOSI personnel will interview individuals who may want to provide a statement.
       First Sergeants will NOT conduct interviews.

       required to assist with the inspection.
       2.4.9. SFS commander will coordinate with the fire department for fire alarm activation.
    2.5. Legal Office:
       2.5.1. Judge Advocate (JA) personnel will be available on-scene to provide assistance to the
       inspectors. JA personnel along with AFOSI will make the determination if probable cause exists
       for a search in the event an inspector finds a questionable item.
    2.6. Demand Reduction Office:
       2.6.1. Demand Reduction Office personnel are responsible for collection and safeguarding urine
       samples provided by dorm residents.

     2.6.2. The preferred collection site is Building 381 at the Demand Reduction Office. This pre-
     vents chain of custody issues, transporting samples, and affords for secure storage of samples.
     However, an alternate location may be selected if appropriate for the dormitory inspection loca-
     tion.

3. INSPECTION PROCEDURES/GUIDELINES:
  3.1. Notification Procedures:
     3.1.1. Squadron commander(s) and first sergeant(s) of the dormitory being inspected will be noti-
     fied no earlier than two duty days prior to the inspection by the CCM. The CCM will notify legal
     office, AFOSI, SFS, and Demand Reduction Office. All other essential personnel will be notified
     no earlier than one duty day prior to inspection date. During final notification, the CCM will task
     first sergeants to bring SNCOs to the inspection to serve as monitors, as required. The first ser-
     geant detailing the SNCOs will follow the required guidelines/criteria established by the Demand
     Reduction Office as listed in Attachment 1.
     3.1.2. Upon initial notification, the first sergeant responsible for the applicable dorm will do the
     following:
        3.1.2.1. Make inspection assignments. Assign first sergeants as inspectors. As a minimum, the
        detailed SNCOs will be assigned (based on dormitory layout): two bus monitors, four dorm
        perimeter monitors, and four male/two female urinalysis observers.
        3.1.2.2. Coordinate with transportation for bus and driver. Contact Vehicle Operations not
        later than one hour prior to requirement. One hour minimum notice is required to request bus
        and driver after duty hours.
        3.1.2.3. Recall dormitory manager no earlier than 1 duty day prior to inspection. Dormitory
        manager is utilized for storing/safeguarding confiscated items during inspection and providing
        assistance to first sergeants/inspection team.
  3.2. The Inspection Process:
     3.2.1. On the morning of the inspection, the affected first sergeant/inspectors will do the follow-
     ing:
        3.2.1.1. Distribute inspection assignments to first sergeants and other monitors/observers as
        members arrive to inspection pre-brief.
        3.2.1.2. Provide dormitory roster to bus monitors, Demand Reduction Office, and JA.
        3.2.1.3. Upon fire alarm activation, inspectors will ensure all military members present have
        their military ID card before directing the member to get on the bus for transport to Demand
        Reduction Office. The bus monitor will ensure all military members fill out a urine specimen
        letter on the bus before arriving at Demand Reduction Office. Civilian guests will be asked to
        leave the dorm room during the inspection and directed to a central location such as a dayroom
        to wait for the sponsor to return. Members will print and sign name, annotate social security
        number and squadron. Additionally, the bus monitor will verify the memberâ€™s military ID
        against the urine specimen letter prior to arrival at collection site. Upon arrival at the collection
        site, the bus monitor will turn signed letters over to Demand Reduction personnel.
        3.2.1.4. No rooms will be inspected prior to the military working dog completing their portion
4                                                                       TRAVISI32-307 15 JUNE 2001


          of the inspection.
          3.2.1.5. Rooms with no occupants present can be inspected once the dogs are done. Rooms
          with occupants present will NOT be inspected until the member returns from providing a
          urine sample.
          3.2.1.6. Secure/safeguard confiscated items.
    3.3. Inspection Procedures/Parameters:
       3.3.1. Be consistent in your approach in each dormitory room; open the same closets and drawers
       in each room; do not target any particular room.
          3.3.1.1. Contraband items are rarely displayed in plain view. Typically they are well hidden or
          concealed. Do NOT let the fact that the military working dogs did not alert in the room lull
          you into a false sense of security. Military working dogs cannot detect all types of contraband.
          3.3.1.2. Open all closed closets and drawers where contraband could be stored.
          3.3.1.3. Do NOT open locked closets or lockers without consent of the dorm resident who
          occupies the room where the locked closet or locker is located. If the person does not consent,
          DO NOT open it. Consult AFOSI/SF/JA to determine if probable cause exists before opening
          a locked closet or locker.
          3.3.1.4. Do NOT open the locked storage bins without consent. Verbal consent is acceptable
          but ensure a third party is present when consent is given. If you believe you may have probable
          cause to open a locked storage bin, consult with a JA representative.
       3.3.2. Listed below are items to look for/confiscate, which are considered illegal contraband:
          3.3.2.1. Illegal narcotics and related drug paraphernalia. All drug paraphernalia, to include
          water bongs, are considered contraband even if displayed for decorative purposes.
          3.3.2.2. Weapons to include switchblade knives, double-edged knives, or other edged knives
          with a blade longer than two and one-half inch, cane gun, wallet gun, any undetectable fire-
          arm, any firearm which is not immediately recognizable as a firearm, any camouflaging fire-
          arm container, any ammunition which contains or consists of any flechette dart, any bullet
          containing or carrying explosive agent, any ballistic knife, any multiburst trigger activator, any
          nanchaku, any short barreled shotgun, any short barreled rifle, metal knuckles, belt buckle
          knife, leaded cane, zip gun, shuriken, unconventional pistol, lipstick case knife, cane sword,
          shobi-zue, air gauge knife, writing pen knife, metal military practice hand grenade or metal
          replica hand grenade, any instrument or weapon commonly known as blackjack, sling shot,
          billy club, sand club, sap, or sandbag, BB/pellet guns, paint ball guns, bows, compound bows,
          crossbows, blow guns and any other item to be used as a weapon or firearm.
          3.3.2.3. Alcohol, if the occupant is under legal drinking age.
          3.3.2.4. Child pornography or other types of sexual materials unlawful under California and
          Federal Code.
          3.3.2.5. Fraudulent military ID cards.
          3.3.2.6. Expired prescription drugs or any prescription drug not issued to the resident.
          3.3.2.7. Candles and incense that exhibit evidence of burning.

     3.3.3. If an illegal or questionable item is discovered, do NOT move or touch the item if at all
     possible. Notify an AFOSI or SF investigator immediately for clarification.
     3.3.4. If an individual tries to make a spontaneous statement that either incriminates, or may
     potentially incriminate, do NOT ask any questions and immediately coordinate an interview with
     the AFOSI or SF personnel.
  3.4. Post Inspection Considerations:
     3.4.1. Squadron commanders/first sergeants will track and follow-up on dormitory residents not
     present at the time of inspection. They will ensure the resident provides a urine sample the next
     duty day member is available.
     3.4.2. Squadron commanders/first sergeants will take appropriate administrative/disciplinary
     action based on findings/outcome of inspection.
     3.4.3. Provide feedback to CCM and other agencies as requested.
