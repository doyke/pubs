                                SOFTWARE DEPLOYMENT

2.1. Software Deployment Process. It is imperative only properly developed, tested, and
certified software is fielded in an operational ICBM unit or used in operational test launches.
Operational software, certified by the Operations Control Board, must be used for operational
test launches. Software certified as ready for operational testing, after completion of
developmental testing shall be used for software operational tests. Software may be used for
other testing purposes prior to certification after proper coordination with AFGSC/A3I,
AFNWC/NIE and other applicable agencies, as necessary (i.e., AFSEC, AFNWC/NCS,
AFGSC/SE, and USSTRATCOM/J384).
2.2. Nuclear Certified Software. Software or associated support software that commands,
controls, targets, or retargets ICBMs is considered software requiring nuclear certification.
     2.2.1. The Nuclear Certified Software Process. Nuclear critical software evaluation can be
     accomplished by NSCCA, or Independent Validation and Verification (IV&V). The
     following paragraphs outline the NSCCA process.
        2.2.1.1. NSCCA. An NSCCA has the single objective of ensuring the program cannot
        perform in any way that could contribute to a nuclear safety violation. An NSCCA is
        accomplished in parallel with software development by an independent contractor to
        ensure critical software does not contain improper design, programming, fabrication, or
        application. The analysis will ensure a software application does not contribute to:
            2.2.1.1.1. Unauthorized or inadvertent pre-arming, arming, launching, or releasing of
            a nuclear weapon or nuclear weapon system.
            2.2.1.1.2. Premature or unsafe operation of a nuclear weapon system.
            2.2.1.1.3. Delivery of a nuclear weapon outside the specified boundary of the
            planned target.
            2.2.1.1.4. Unauthorized, improper, or erroneous display of status or classified
            information that could degrade nuclear surety.
            2.2.1.1.5. Improper handling of classified cryptographic codes, invalid verification,
            or the retrieval of such codes by unauthorized persons in a manner that could degrade
            nuclear surety.
        2.2.1.2. The NSCCA contractor provides a report of their crosscheck and analysis to
        AFNWC/NI. AFNWC/NI approves the report and includes it in a certification package.
        AFNWC/NI delivers the certification recommendation report to AFNWC/NCS and
        AFSEC/SEW. AFSEC/SEW will review the report and deem whether the software meets
        the stringent certification requirements for use with nuclear weapons.
        2.2.1.3. Nuclear Safety Design Certification. A determination by AFSEC/SEW that is
        forwarded to AFNWC/NCS and AFNCW/NI that all applicable nuclear safety criteria for
        a given hardware or software design have been met and the design is authorized for use
        with nuclear weapons--also referred to as "nuclear safety certification" or "design
        certification" IAW AFI63-125.
AFGSCI13-5306 26 MARCH 2013                                                                     7


      2.2.1.4. AFNWC Review. AFNWC/NI and AFNWC/NCS will complete and review the
      NSCCA report, test and evaluation information and the AFSEC/SEW certification letter
      and forward this information to HQ AFGSC/A3I. If the software did not pass the
      certification requirements, HQ AFGSC/A3I must decide whether to continue the program
      and coordinate with AFNWC/NI on a corrective action plan. This plan must take into
      account the time and cost of another NSCCA after the software developer corrects the
      problem.
      2.2.1.5. TPC. Once the NSCCA software bit-by-bit comparison is complete, the
      government will place the software under TPC control IAW AFI91-105, Critical
      Components, and AFI91-104, Nuclear Surety Tamper Control and Detection Programs.
      The software will then be transported to either 625 STOS/OSK or USSTRATCOM/J384
      and kept under TPC until decertified or destroyed.
      2.2.1.6. HQ AFGSC/A3I Software Certification.          For operational software, HQ
      AFGSC/A3I will review the Software Version Document (SVD), findings from the
      Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E), NSCCA report, AFNWC nuclear certification
      summary, to include the software being listed on the Master Nuclear Certification Listing
      (MNCL), AFNWC/NI review and release memorandum. If the software meets
      requirements, HQ AFGSC/A3I will certify the software is ready for use and notify
      AFNWC/NI, USSTRATCOM, AFSEC/SEW, HQ AFGSC/SEW, 20AF/A3NV, 625
      STOS/OSK, affected units, and other units as applicable. A memorandum will document
      HQ AFGSC/A3I certification for use. If the software does not meet requirements, HQ
      AFGSC/A3I will notify AFNWC/NI of discrepancies. HQ AFGSC/A3I and AFNWC/NI
      will then agree on a plan of action to either correct the software, field it with the
      discrepancy or discontinue the program. Software with discrepancies will require HQ
      AFGSC/SEW and AFSEC/SEW approval prior to fielding, and must not affect nuclear
      surety/safety.
      2.2.1.7. HQ AFGSC/A3I Deployment Authorization. HQ AFGSC/A3I and HQ
      AFGSC/SEW are the final approval authorities for deploying new, modified, or
      associated support software to the field which commands, controls, or retargets ICBMs.
      HQ AFGSC/A3I will coordinate with USSTRATCOM J384/J315, AFNWC/NI,
      AFSEC/SEW, HQ AFGSC/SEW, 20 AF/A3N, and 625 STOS/OSK, as applicable, and
      any other necessary agencies prior to fielding to ensure contractor, NSCCA certification,
      testing, and technical order (T.O.) changes are complete and the criteria in AFI63-125
      and AFI91-103 are met.
2.3. Development Activities.
   2.3.1. T.O. In-Process Reviews (IPR) and Publication Reviews. T.O. IPRs and publication
   reviews are periodically hosted by the contractor/subcontractor to demonstrate to the
   government the necessary level of fidelity is incorporated into operations and maintenance
   T.O.s and manuals.
   2.3.2. T.O. Validation and Verification (V&V). T.O. V&V is accomplished by AFNWC/NI
   and 20 AF (or by units with 20 AF and AFNWC/NI oversight). AFNWC/NI and 20 AF will
   accomplish all T.O. checklists which are affected by the program at an operational test site(s)
   at either Vandenberg AFB or Hill AFB (an engineering model may be used as well) to ensure
   the T.O. is written correctly and achieves the desired results. Once V&V is complete, the
 8                                                           AFGSCI13-5306 26 MARCH 2013


     T.O.s are ready for use in the field; however, the system must be nuclear certified by
     AFNWC and authorized for duplication, distribution, and use by HQ AFGSC/A3I and 20 AF
     prior to deployment at an operational unit.
     2.3.3. OT&E. Various kinds of OT&E are conducted during a system’s life cycle to ensure
     the Air Force acquires and maintains operationally effective and suitable systems to meet
     user requirements. OT&E will be conducted in an operationally realistic environment at
     either Vandenberg AFB or Hill AFB. OT&E helps identify and resolve deficiencies as early
     as possible. Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) is conducted to determine the
     operational effectiveness and suitability of systems undergoing Research and Development
     (R&D) efforts.
2.4. Non-Nuclear Certified Software. ICBM software not requiring nuclear certification must
be tested and released by AFNWC/NI to HQ AFGSC and approved for operational use by
HQ AFGSC/A3I. All software used in the field or in support of ICBMs must be tested to ensure
the software meets the user needs/requirements. All software used in the field or in support of
any ICBM system/sub-system must be the same revision/version that is annotated in Automated
Computer Program Identification Number System (ACPINS). Except for the NSCCA
requirement and AFNWC nuclear certification, the process is nearly identical to nuclear certified
software.
     2.4.1. HQ AFGSC/A3I Authorization for Use. For operational software, HQ AFGSC/A3I
     will review the Software Version Description (SVD), the findings from Force Development
     Evaluation (FDE) and any information/recommendation from AFNWC/NI. If the software
     meets requirements, HQ AFGSC/A3I will authorize the software for use in the field and
     notify AFNWC/NI, USSTRATCOM, AFSEC/SEW, 20 AF/A3N, affected units, and other
     units, as applicable. A memorandum will document approval. If the software does not meet
     requirements, HQ AFGSC/A3I will notify AFNWC/NI of discrepancies. HQ AFGSC/A3I
     and AFNWC/NI will then agree on a plan of action to correct the software, field it with the
     discrepancy (if minor), or discontinue the program.
     2.4.2. Software and Databases on Targeting Material Identification Letters (TMIL). 625
     STOS/ OSK will provide HQ AFGSC/A3IA with a draft copy NLT 7 days prior to effective
     date.
2.5. ICBM Unit Software Deployment. Prior to fielding new or modified software, units must
possess an authorization letter from HQ AFGSC/A3I and appropriate T.O. changes. For
operations weapon systems T.O.s, a unit must have sufficient copies of the appropriate changes
to ensure every combat mission ready crew has updated T.O.s prior to software deployment. The
appropriate change is verified by comparing the delivered software to ACPINS. Additionally,
nuclear certified software must be verified against the MNCL. Unit must verify certification
status and configuration of all software prior to deployment by using the MNCL. The MNCL
home page link is https://wwwmil.nwc.kirtland.af.mil/MNCL/index.cfm and is managed by
498 NSW.
     2.5.1. If incorrect software/programs/tapes/CDs are loaded into an operational Launch
     Control Center (LCC) and/or LF, accomplish the following:
        2.5.1.1. Load the correct version as soon as possible.
AFGSCI13-5306 26 MARCH 2013                                                                9


      2.5.1.2. Report the incident to HQ AFGSC A3IA/A3IN as soon as possible through the
      AFGSC Command Center (DSN 781-0947). HQ AFGSC A3IA/A3IN will contact
      USSTRATCOM/J334 (DSN STE 272-5751) with operational impact and corrective
      actions required.
      2.5.1.3. Accomplish any HQ AFGSC/A3I mandated corrective actions.
      2.5.1.4. Accomplish appropriate actions in accordance with AFI91-114, Safety Rules for

      investigation and corrective actions are complete. For an LF, accomplish Crew
      Document Annotation Procedures (CDAP) and safe the sortie as required until
      investigation and corrective actions are complete.
      2.5.1.5. Contact HQ AFGSC/SEW to determine if reporting is required IAW AFMAN
      91-221, Weapon Safety Investigations and Reports.
2.6. 625 STOS Software Program.
   2.6.1. The following programs are used by 625 STOS/OSK to generate and validate
   targeting materials:
      2.6.1.1. Strategic Targeting Support Software (STSS) supporting MM is hosted on 625
      STOS/OSK's REACT Virtual Address extension (VAX) computer system. The STSS
      simulates the operations of the LCC's Weapon System Processor (WSP) for execution of
      the OTP and EPP. For Operational Test Launch (OTL), STSS runs a Minuteman
      Trajectory Simulation Program (MTSP) to produce range safety data and nominal
      trajectory data. STSS can also perform engineering analysis of the OTP and other WSP
      programs and data bases.
      2.6.1.2. The MERGER program produces the LF Master DBs. The LF Master DBs are
      produced on Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) Targeting and Application
      Computer System (STACS).
      2.6.1.3. Quality Inspection Check Program (QUICK) verifies the data on the LF Master
      DB. QUICK is a nuclear-certified software program used on STACS.
      2.6.1.4. EPP Database Generator (DBG) is a nuclear-certified software program. The
      Mission Planning Program (MPP) produces a data set on STACS used by the EPP DBG
      to build the annual force-wide EPP/MA operational DB.

              CONTROL OF OPERATIONAL TARGETING SOFTWARE

3.1. Critical Components. The programs and tapes/CDs listed in paragraph 3.1.1 through 3.1.5
are critical components. Adhere to the requirements of USAF TPC control. TPC requirements
apply to USSTRATCOM, AFGSC, and all subordinate unit personnel. Nuclear certification
requirements are delineated in AFMAN91-118, Safety Design and Evaluation Criteria for
Nuclear Weapon Systems and AFI63-125, Nuclear Certification Program. Critical components
for targeting include:
   3.1.1. MOTP Executable.
   3.1.2. EPP DBG.
   3.1.3. EPP Executable.
   3.1.4. QUICK.
   3.1.5. STACS.
3.2. Non-critical Components. The programs and tapes/CDs listed in paragraph 3.2.3.1
through 3.2.3.7 are not critical components; however, they require TPC control to ensure system
integrity. The following exceptions apply:
   3.2.1. Contractor/AFNWC/NI Facilities. Test versions of the programs and tapes/CDs listed
   below that are used at contractor/AFNWC/NI facilities do not require TPC.
   3.2.2. 576 FLTS: Test versions of the programs and tapes/CDs listed below that are used in
   the 576 FLTS Wing Codes Processing System (WCPS) require TPC handling to maintain
   system integrity. However, once 576 FLTS personnel transfer data to WCPS products for
   use in tests, TPC is not required.
   3.2.3. Non-critical components for targeting, that require TPC, include:
       3.2.3.1. TAMP DB. Note: SERV FDE ONLY TAMP DB does not require TPC
       3.2.3.2. TCI/EPCI tapes/CDs.
       3.2.3.3. LF Master DB.
       3.2.3.4. EPP/MA DB. (Retain Operational and Training copies under TPC)
       3.2.3.5. MM OTP.
       3.2.3.6. MPP.
       3.2.3.7. MERGER Program.
3.3. Operational Test Launch (OTL) Software Production.
   3.3.1. 625 STOS/OSK will use the STSS to generate range safety data, nominal trajectory
   data, and special analysis when requested to support ICBM flight testing at Vandenberg
   AFB. 625 STOS/OSK is responsible for packing, shipping, and maintaining accountability
   of classified materials.
AFGSCI13-5306 26 MARCH 2013                                                                     11


   3.3.2. The Chief, 625 STOS/OSK will oversee generation and processing of OTL materials
   for FDE to ensure timely completion and shipment. He/she will designate a project officer
   responsible for generating and verifying all computer products necessary to meet test launch
   requirements. The Chief, 625 STOS/OSK will also designate a verification officer to
   monitor the OTL materials production and provide a quality control check in accordance
   with internal checklist procedures. Upon assembly of all required materials, a quality check
   is performed with the project officer and the verification officer to ensure all OTL targeting
   materials and range safety data are complete and accurate.
   3.3.3. 625 STOS/OSK will send OTL data 60 days prior to the test launch date. 625
   STOS/OSK must receive all required materials, to include the Aimpoint Document,
   MGS/Gyro Letter and the Test Execution Order, a minimum of 10 duty days prior to the
   required send date. If they have not received the primary and secondary MGS data before
   the 60-day point, they will send OTL data in multiple packages. Nominal data will be sent
   prior to the 60-day point, followed by the primary and secondary MGS data once it is
   received and processed.
3.4. Range Safety Materials. The STSS produces range safety data for OTLs. The nominal
trajectory print defines missile flight by position and altitude of each missile stage and re-entry
system. The MM Trajectory Simulation Program (MTSP) provides engineering state vectors for
each object reentering the atmosphere with respect to downrange radars. This data facilitates
selective acquisition of reentering objects.

                                            Chapter 4

                        MINUTEMAN TARGETING CAPABILTIES

4.1. MM Targeting Capabilities. The MM Missile Guidance Computer (MGC) within the
MGS stores four sets of target data, each target set constituting a particular mission. Each sortie
requires the installation of appropriate target cases to gain initial alert status. Once target sets
have valid case data loaded, each individual target set may be updated when new targeting data
is addressed to any of the target sets. Additionally, each sortie has two sets of execution plan
case data, which provides execution options and launch timing.
4.2. Configurations. Line two of the target case input denotes the sortie's configuration
identification through the configuration data string. (See Virtual Case Book front matter for
Configuration Data String Table.)
4.3. Remote Targeting Description. MM has the capability to transfer Force Direction
Message (FDM) targeting data received over the Strategic Automated Command and Control
System (SACCS) directly into the Weapon System Control Element (WSCE) for input,
generation, and Remote Data Change (RDC).
   4.3.1. MM Targeting Materials.
       4.3.1.1. MOTP. Written to operate in the LCC WSP, MOTP simulates the missile’s
       flight to generate unique launcher/target dependent constants. These constants are
       encoded, transmitted to the LF, and used by the flight program. MOTP uses case input
       data from the Bulk Storage Loader (BS/L), WSP, or manual keyboard input. For Target
       Case Generation (TCG), the case input provides a case number, sortie identification,
       target data, and other trajectory and reentry vehicle fuzing information. Additionally,
       MOTP uses information from the MOTP DB, TAMP DB, and LF Master DB.
       4.3.1.2. MOTP DB. Contains geodetic, climatological, generic Inertial Measurement
       Unit (IMU) coefficients, and Minimum Case Input data. The database tape/CD is loaded
       into the HDA.
           4.3.1.2.1. Geodetic Data. Precise launcher location and gravity data for missile
           trajectory computations. All geodetic data is based on DoD World Geodetic System's
           (WGS 84) reference ellipsoid. There are two sets of geodetic data, Missile Launch
           Site Data (MLSD) and Launch Region Gravity Model (LRGM).
               4.3.1.2.1.1. Missile Launch Site Data. Produced by the National Geospatial-
               Intelligence Agency (NGA) and are refined launch site geodetics. When these
               geodetics are incorporated into the MLSD listing, they become the launcher
               geodetic source document for the MOTP DB and the LF Master DB.
               4.3.1.2.1.2. Launch Region Gravity Model. Contains launch region peculiar
               gravity values for the MOTP. This data is produced by NGA.
           4.3.1.2.2. Climatological Data. Upper air densities and winds affect the reentry
           vehicle’s trajectory and warhead fuzing. Annual (mean) climatological data for
           numerous grid points over the target area are developed and compiled into the
           climatological data set. Climatology is produced by the Combat Climatology Center.
AFGSCI13-5306 26 MARCH 2013                                                                13


        4.3.1.2.3. Generalized Error IMU Compensation (GENERIC) Coefficients. Used in
        the MOTP IMU compensation model to calculate the position and velocity
        corrections at Stage 3 thrust termination.
        4.3.1.2.4. Minimum Case Input. Reduces the amount of data the keyboard operator
        must input. Minimum input recalls pre-stored data and default settings that select
        quantities and options normally specified in the case input.
     4.3.1.3. LF Master DB. Contains specific launch site data to include gravity values,
     launcher geodetic latitude/longitude, and selected timer settings. The following timer
     values are included on the tape/CD: Single vote (set between 0 and 24 hours), Airborne
     Launch Control Center (ALCC) lockout (set between 0 and 24 hours), ALCC hold off
     (set between 11 minutes and 57.3 hours), CO-OP Enable Display and Response (set at 1
     and 4 seconds, respectively), and four Cancel Launch-In-Process (CLIP) timers
     (disabled).
        4.3.1.3.1. The database tape/CD is loaded into the HDA. The LF Master DB is also
        read to a Launch Facility Load Cartridge (LFLC) for subsequent upload to the MGS.
        4.3.1.3.2. The actual settings of the operational and test timer values will be
        maintained by HQ AFGSC/A3IA and A3IT, respectively. Request any changes to
        those timer values in writing. Include a statement of the effect on OTLs. Coordinate
        with 20 AF/CC through             20 AF/A3NK, 625 STOS/ALCS, 625 STOS/OSK,
        A3I, A5I, AFGSC/SEW, and AFNWC/NI with an information copy sent to AFSEC
        and AFNWC.
     4.3.1.4. TAMP DB. Contains the mass properties for all missile and reentry system
     configurations, as well as the WGS 84 earth reference model. The MOTP uses the
     TAMP region data identified on the case input for TCG.
     4.3.1.5. TCI/EPCI. Contains sortie, target and timing data, and execution options for use
     in the MM III weapon system.
     4.3.1.6. EPP. The executable program used to generate sortie-unique execution plan
     constant sets. When combined with the EPP DB and the squadron EPCI data, the EPP
     will generate execution plan constants to be remotely transferred to the sorties in
     preparation for Preparatory Launch Command-A (PLC-A) processing. The EPP executes
     strategic options.
     4.3.1.7. EPP/MA DB. Contains PLC-A numbers and their corresponding attack options
     for two revisions. It also contains a message analysis function so that the executed
     option(s) can be determined from the execution characters.
 14                                                         AFGSCI13-5306 26 MARCH 2013


                                           Chapter 5

                     TARGET MATERIAL RECEIPT/VERIFICATION

5.1. Targeting Materials. Units will maintain a list of current targeting materials. HQ
AFGSC/A3I will provide the TMIL which lists current EPP, TCI/EPCI tapes/CDs, MOTP,
TAMP, MOTP DB, LF Master DB, and EPP/MA DB by title, identification number, tape/CD
number, classification, and date produced. Guidance will identify targeting materials to be
superseded or destroyed. For operational and 576 FLTS TMILs, 625 STOS/OSK will provide
HQ AFGSC/A3I with a draft copy NLT 48 hours prior to effective date.
   5.1.1. (576 FLTS only) When in receipt of contractor-provided tapes/CDs, the TMCO or
   ATMCO must provide a written inventory to 625 STOS/OSK and courtesy copy HQ
   AFGSC/A3I within 15 duty days of receipt of the tapes/CDs.
   5.1.2. Only the TMCO/ATMCO will receive and/or open target materials. The TMCO will
   accomplish the following verification procedures upon receipt of targeting materials:
       5.1.2.1. Ensure the tape/CD information on the label matches the number on the current
       TMIL. If discrepancies exist, notify 625 STOS/OSK immediately by telephone, DSN
       271-6042. Place the questionable tape/CD in appropriate storage and do not use it until
       625 STOS/OSK provides resolution.
       5.1.2.2. Missile Control Target Materials Custodians (576 FLTS: TMCO/ATMCO) will
       verify all tapes/CDs as soon as possible after receipt and before operational use.
       Verification consists of the following:
           5.1.2.2.1. Ensure WCPS successfully reads/loads each tape/CD. As applicable,
           tapes/CDs include MM LF Master DB, MM EPP, EPP DB, TCI/EPCI, MOTP,
           TAMP DB, MOTP DB, and MM EPP/MA DB.
   5.1.3. If any tape/CD fails to verify or load during field operations, the TMCO will notify
   625 STOS/OSK immediately by secure telephone and follow-up message. Place failed
   tape/CD in appropriate storage and don't use it for operational targeting or OTLs. 625
   STOS/OSK will provide resolution on the final disposition of the tape/CD.
5.2. Titles. Units will not alter the title(s) of any WCPS generated materials, with the exception
of parenthetical descriptions (for example, the WCPS generates the title “REACT MOTP
TAMP”). 20 AF/A3N will verify ICBM units are using the proper materials by cross-checking
the BS/L HDA ID data sheet with the build sheet.
5.3. Distribution.
   5.3.1. Targeting materials are distributed in sealed packages through administrative service
   channels. The method of distribution (special aircraft, courier, or mail) is dependent on the
   nature of the material, classification, and its effective date.
   5.3.2. Unit OSB and 576 FLTS/TEX will control, store, and document destruction of all
   issued tapes/CDs.
5.4. Destruction of Target Materials:
AFGSCI13-5306 26 MARCH 2013                                                                   15


  5.4.1. The HQ AFGSC/A3I TMIL authorizes destruction of targeting materials. The TMCO
  notifies OSB personnel of materials identified for destruction. Units will not destroy
  targeting materials until they receive a TMIL authorizing destruction. All destruction
  requests should be sent to HQ AFGSC/A3IA with an info copy to 625 STOS/OSK.
  5.4.2. Destroy targeting data on magnetic tapes by either degaussing or burning. Degaussing
  is the preferred means of destroying magnetic target materials. Destroy targeting data on
  optical media (CDs) in accordance with DoD Manual 5200.01, Volume 3, DoD Information
  Security Program: Protection of Classified Information, and the evaluated products list
  (EPL) produced by NSA. Only National Security Agency (NSA)-approved degaussers may
  be used.
  5.4.3. Units may reuse or dispose of degaussed magnetic tapes. Notify the unit TMCO by
  letter when destruction actions are complete. The unit TMCO will notify 625 STOS/OSK
  within 15 duty days by letter when destruction is complete.
  5.4.4. 30 SW/SEY and 576 FLTS/TEX only: OTL Range Safety, Nominal Trajectory, and
  target case printouts as well as compact discs will be destroyed no later than six months after
  the applicable test launch unless notified by 625 STOS/OSK to retain this data for longer
  periods. These materials may be retained for engineering purposes. When no longer needed,
  destroy in accordance with DoD Manual 5200.01, Volume 3, DoD Information Security
  Program: Protection of Classified Information and AFI31-401, Information Security
  Program Management.
