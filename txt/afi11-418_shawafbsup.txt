6.5.6.1.), the SOF nomination memorandum has been revised (Attachment 5), and multiple
frequencies and referenced publications are updated.
 2                                             AFI11-418_SHAWAFBSUP 20 AUGUST 2012




2.2.2. The intent of the Operations Supervisor (Top 3)/Senior Duty Officer (SDO) position is to
have the most qualified individual present to make ops-related decisions involving daily flying
activities.Under normal circumstances, this duty will be performed by a Top 3 qualified
individual. Under rare circumstances of reduced manning, such as deployed or “split”
operations, the FS/CC can designate an additional highly-qualified individual to act as SDO.
This requires 20 OG/CC approval.
3.1.1.1. (Added) The Shaw AFB local area encompasses all Military Operating Areas (MOAs),
Warning Areas, Restricted Areas, Class A/B/C Ranges, Military Training Routes, military bases
and civil airfields within a 250 NM radius of Shaw AFB.
3.1.2.1. (Added) Cross-country sorties, other than those originating or terminating at Shaw
AFB, should be considered On-Going Off-Station sorties and require an SDO.
3.1.4.1. (Added) A SOF is not required for local air defense sorties, whether it is a deployed
unit or 20 OG-assigned tasking. The designated Alert Mission Director will fulfill the Top 3 role
for alert taskings.
4.3.1.1. (Added) The SOF must coordinate with the 20 OG/CC and notify the command post
prior to leaving the tower for an extended no-fly period. Include a telephone number and take
the FM radio. Command Post will notify fighter squadrons. If a changeover is required, arrange
to transfer responsibility and notify the command post and 20 OG/CC. The squadrons will notify
the command post when they plan to resume flying operations.
4.3.2.2. (Added) The SOF should be familiar with the daily flying schedule including all
upgrades, check rides and training requirements during his/her period of SOF duty.
4.3.2.3. (Added) The SOF will be primarily responsible for all 20 FW aircraft once they have
left their respective squadron parking areas. This includes aircraft on taxiway Alpha, in arm, de-
arm and the hot pits.
4.3.4.1. (Added) SOFs will take action to prevent or limit foreign object damage (FOD). If
maintenance discovers a FOD hazard, Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will notify the
SOF of tail number, type of Foreign Object (FO) and possible location. The SOF will
accomplish the FOD Hazard Checklist. Operations will be deconflicted to avoid exposing other
aircraft to FO.
4.3.5.1. (Added) When an aircraft has experienced a serious in-flight or ground emergency,
reference restrictions in the 20 FW Pilot Aid as to whether the pilot should shut down on the
runway, at the End of Runway (EOR), or taxi back to parking.
4.3.7.1. (Added) SOFs will continuously strive to keep abreast of changes that impact Shaw
AFB, local diverts, training airspace, and the flying schedule, including periodically reviewing
Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs).
4.3.8.1. (Added) SOFs and Top 3s will be proactive to mitigate risks associated with
thunderstorms, especially the hazard posed by lightning to personnel on the ground. If lightning
AFI11-418_SHAWAFBSUP 20 AUGUST 2012                                                              3


is observed or estimated to be within 5 miles of Shaw, immediately accomplish the Lightning
within 5 Checklist.
4.3.8.2. (Added) A reduced flying schedule is an option when weather doesn‟t permit visual
flight rules (VFR) patterns, Air Traffic Control (ATC) saturation is likely, or useable training
airspace is limited. The SOF should evaluate the weather, alternates and ATC capabilities and
make a recommendation to the 20 OG/CC.
4.3.8.3. (Added) The SOF will be the primary decision-maker for weather holds and will
coordinate with the squadrons and 20 OG/CC for decisions regarding weather cancels.
4.3.8.4. (Added) When transitioning from weather hold back to flying, the SOF will determine
the first takeoff time with the 20 OG/CC.
4.3.9.1. (Added) The SOF should coordinate runway changes with the tower watch supervisor
IAW the Runway Change Checklist. The SOF determines whether conditions dictate suspending
flying operations. Normally, SOFs should recommend a runway change if tailwind component
exceeds 10 knots.
4.3.9.2. (Added) The SOF will notify tower watch supervisor if pilots request an airfield
lighting change.
4.3.10.1. (Added) SOFs will use the 20 FW SOF Tour Report (SHAWAFB Form 26, SOF
Tour Report) as the daily log. Instructions for filling out the report are located in the SOF Quick
Reaction Checklist (QRC). Additionally, as part of certification, SOF nominees will receive
instruction on how to complete the reports during their academics with 20 OG/OGV and during
their first supervised SOF Tour.
4.3.11.1. (Added) Inform the 20 OG/CC of all emergencies when time permits.
4.3.12. (Added) Replacement SOFs will accomplish the SOF Changeover Checklist. If there is
an emergency in progress, the replacement SOF will assist the on-duty SOF until the emergency
is terminated.
4.3.13. (Added) The SOF will accomplish the SOF Closing Checklist once all aircraft are
shutdown.
4.4.5.2.1. (Added) Prior to the first pilot step, Top 3s will verify Patriot Excalibur (PEX) is
correct. Changes will be updated in PEX by Squadron Aviation Resource Management (SARM)
personnel. Advise the SOF if changes affect pilot name, call sign, number of aircraft, weather
category, upgrades or flight times. Amend flight plans through Airfield Management, if
required.
4.4.5.3.1. (Added) Squadron Top 3s are directly responsible for their pilots and aircraft prior to
taxi and once they are back in parking. Decisions pertaining to scheduling changes, operations
cancels, and spare procedures are primarily the responsibility of squadron Top 3s.
4.5.4. (Added) The 20 FW Command Post will be notified of active runway, designated
alternate, changes in airfield status, and schedule adds/changes as a result of a completed AF
Form 2407.
5.1.1.1. (Added) Shaw AFB single frequency approach (SFA) is UHF 19. Under most
circumstances, emergency aircraft should also be directed to contact the SOF on VHF 18 for
discrete coordination with the SOF.
 4                                            AFI11-418_SHAWAFBSUP 20 AUGUST 2012


5.1.1.2. (Added) The SOF will coordinate requests for SFA with tower watch supervisor who
will, in-turn, coordinate with Radar Approach Control (RAPCON).
5.1.2.1. (Added) Tower personnel will notify appropriate agencies via activation of the "Crash
Net."
5.1.6.1. (Added) If there is a doubt as to whether a condition will worsen, the SOF should not
hesitate to declare an emergency.
5.1.9. (Added) The runway will be inspected following any emergency that may adversely
affect runway conditions. Coordinate requests through tower watch supervisor or airfield
management.
6.1.2.1. (Added) The SOF may use GUARD anytime an emergency dictates, or to broadcast
updated field conditions or alternate requirements. Normally the SOF should consult the watch
supervisor or have the watch supervisor make/coordinate radio calls on GUARD.
6.1.2.2. (Added) In the interest of safety, emergency response agencies, such as the Fire Chief
or Emergency Power Unit (EPU) response team, do not need to coordinate through the SOF prior
to transmitting directly on UHF channel 19 to distressed pilots once they have landed. The tower
will advise the Fire Chief or EPU response team when the pilot is on channel 19. The Fire Chief
will release the channel back to the tower at the conclusion of the emergency.
6.1.3. (Added) Unfavorable conditions between the SOF and Tower, RAPCON, or Airfield
Management should be reported to 20 OG/OGV. 20 OG/OGV and 20 OSS/OSA will resolve
any training, procedural, or personnel issues.
6.2.2.1. (Added) For local flying operations, the maximum SOF duty shift is 8 hours. The SOF
duty shift may be extended to 12 hours with 20 OG/CC approval for events such as contingency
operations, deployments or Phase I/II operations.
6.2.3.1. (Added) The SOF will be in the control tower 90 minutes prior to first takeoff.
6.3.2.5. (Added) The 20 FW SOF's designated alternate duty locations are:
6.3.2.5.1. (Added) The SOF vehicle on the airfield.
6.3.2.5.2. (Added) The squadron operations desk.
6.3.2.5.3. (Added) The command post.
6.4.2.1. (Added) Weather reporting resources include: Local Weather Network System
(LWNS), Shaw Intranet, RAPCON scope, and Pilot Reports (PIREPS). Use of RAPCON scope
will be coordinated with tower watch supervisor and should be used only as a quick reference for
weather conditions. The SOF will relay PIREPs to the tower and base weather. Ensure PIREP
information is reported on Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS) and pilots are aware
of the latest applicable PIREP information.
6.4.3.1. (Added) The SOF vehicle will be kept at the base of the tower. 20 OG/OGV will
ensure the SOF vehicle is in good working order. During emergencies or airfield inspections, the
SOF should normally remain in the tower, but it is at the SOF‟s discretion to use the SOF vehicle
when deemed necessary.
6.4.7.1. (Added) If tower personnel are using alternate location procedures, the SOF will use
the SOF vehicle (reference the SOF Bugout Checklist located in the SOF Quick Reaction
AFI11-418_SHAWAFBSUP 20 AUGUST 2012                                                              5


Checklist). The SOF should monitor all takeoffs and landings. The vehicle location should
provide a clear view of approaches to the active runways, normally near the approach end.
6.4.7.2. (Added) When using the SOF vehicle as an alternate duty location, the SOF will take
the SOF Kit from the tower.
6.5.1.2. (Added) SOF nominees will have completed the four-ship flight lead upgrade program
before entry in the SOF upgrade program.
6.5.6.1. (Added) Once certified as a SOF, all SOFs are qualified as SOF Instructors. This is
indicated by the OG/CC signature on the SOF Certification Memorandum and squadron letter of
X‟s (LOXs) by a „X‟ in the SOF column.
6.6.1.1. (Added) All 20 FW upgrading SOFs must complete the training and certification
program IAW 20 FW SOF Training/Certification Program (Attachment 6).
6.6.2.1. (Added) Prior to beginning the SOF upgrade, SOF upgrade nominees will be approved
by their squadron commander (20 FW SOF Nomination Memorandum, Attachment 5).
6.7.2.1. (Added) Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) will be used to track SOF
currency. After every SOF tour, individuals will update their currency by logging a SOF event
in PEX. Supervised tours will be documented on the 20 FW SOF Tour Report (SHAWAFB
Form 26, SOF Tour Report).
6.8.1.1. (Added) 20 FW/SEF, 20 FW/XPI, 20 OSS/OSA and 20 OSS/OSW should be consulted
when developing semi-annual meeting agendas.
6.8.2.1. (Added) The annual review and 20 OG/CC briefing will be accomplished semi-
annually in conjunction with the semi-annual SOF meeting.
6.9.1.1. (Added) 20 OG/OGV is the OPR for administration of the 20 FW Operations
Supervision Program.
6.9.2.3.1. (Added) Original initial certification training records will be retained by the squadron
in the individual‟s grade book.
6.9.2.3.2. (Added) 20 OG/OGV will track continuation training records via PEX using the
Flight Crew Information File (FCIF) function. Semi-annual meeting minutes will be posted in
PEX as a SOF Read File which will allow 20 OG/OGV to confirm that all SOFs have either
attended the meeting or reviewed the minutes.
8.3.1. (Added) A SOF will be in the tower for all functional check flights (FCFs). If an FCF is
outside the normal flying window, the affected squadron will schedule the SOF. A Top 3 is not
required.
8.4.1. (Added) The SOF Read File will be maintained by 20 OG/OGV. Electronic copies will
be stored on the OGV SharePoint Site and in PEX. Hard copies will be kept in the tower at the
SOF position. 20 OG/OGV will review the Read File contents annually.
8.5.1. (Added) The primary reference for the SOF local procedures and checklists is the 20 FW
SOF QRC. The SOF Quick Reaction Checklist contains the following: SOF Opening Checklist,
SOF Changeover Checklist, SOF Closing Checklist, SOF Tour Report Guidance, Recurring SOF
