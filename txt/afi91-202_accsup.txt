2.1.4.5. (Added) Squadron level FSOs will not fill a wing UMD FSO position, but will assist
the wing Chief of Flight Safety in the overall management of the flight safety program. The
primary duty of the Squadron level FSO is to manage the squadron's internal flight safety
program as directed by the squadron commander. Squadrons that do not have an FSO shall
appoint a SAFSO to assist in managing the internal squadron flight safety program and to
function in the absence of the FSO. Commanders may elect to designate an Additional Duty
FSNCO (ADFSNCO), in lieu of a SAFSO, if rated officer manning is insufficient. A person
designated as a squadron ADFSNCO will be either a qualified crewmember or a maintainer.
Units may use local discretion in using assigned FSOs and SAFSOs to ensure squadron and wing
flight safety programs are effectively and efficiently managed. Using FSOs in roles other than
those specified in this supplement will be approved in writing by the DRU/NAF Chief of Safety,
as appropriate. Squadron level FSOs and SAFSOs will maintain CMR status in operational
squadrons and will be rated by the assigned unit squadron commander. FSOs at the Wing level
or above will be exempt from full-time additional duties not directly related to flying IAW AFI

(SAV) within 120 days.
3.2.3. (Added) Safety programs will be evaluated using a five-tier rating system consisting of
the grades Outstanding, Excellent, Satisfactory, Marginal and Unsatisfactory. Inspection team
chiefs may assign ratings that accurately reflect observed performance regardless of statistical
outcomes. Specific criteria are designed as a guide and are not a substitute for the judgment of
the inspector. However, when ratings differ significantly from established criteria, the rational
should be explained. Individual discipline PME ratings defined as follows:
3.2.3.1. (Added) OUTSTANDING: Far exceed mission requirements indicated in the areas of
operation or performance. This is demonstrated when procedures and activities are carried out in
a far superior manner. Programs and resources are efficiently managed and demonstrate

outstanding).
3.2.3.2. (Added) EXCELLENT: Exceeds mission requirements indicated in the areas of
operation or performance. This is demonstrated when procedures and activities are carried out in
a superior manner. Programs and resources are efficiently managed and are relatively free of
discrepancies. (75% of major program elements rated excellent or above).
3.2.3.3. (Added) SATISFACTORY: Meets mission requirements indicated in the areas of
operation or performance. This is demonstrated when procedures and activities are effectively
and competently carried out. (65% of major program elements rated satisfactory or above).
3.2.3.4. (Added) MARGINAL: Does not meet mission requirements indicated in the areas of
operation or performance. Procedures and activities are not carried out in an efficient manner.
Deficiencies exist that impede or limit mission accomplishment. (55% or more of major program
elements rated marginal or below).
3.2.3.5. (Added) UNSATISFACTORY: Does not meet mission requirements indicated in the
areas of operation or performance. Procedures and activities are not carried out in an adequate
manner. Resources and programs are not adequately managed. Significant deficiencies exist that
preclude or seriously limit mission accomplishment. (45% or more of major program elements
are rated as unsatisfactory).
3.2.4. (Added) Overall PME Ratings defined as follows:
3.2.4.1. (Added) OUTSTANDING – Two or more disciplines rated as outstanding and no
discipline rated lower than excellent.
3.2.4.2. (Added) EXCELLENT – Two or more disciplines rated as excellent or higher and no
discipline rated lower than satisfactory.

3.5.1. Chief of Safety will determine the frequency of spot inspections for Wing Safety and
USR‘s. However, as a minimum 1 spot inspection will be performed by each full time safety
professional and/or USR per week. COS will ensure activities which operate around the clock
are adequately surveyed at times other than normal duty hours. Spot inspections will be
documented on a locally developed spot inspection log or electronic database.
3.6. MAJCOM, NAF, centers, and wings may designate high interest areas based on local
situation and/or special needs. If designated, High Interest Areas will be inspected at least
weekly and may be counted as a normal spot inspection.
3.9.3. NAF/SE SAVs of wing safety programs are valuable tools for maintaining strong mishap
prevention programs. IAW AFI 90-201, wing Commanders are urged to request NAF/SE SAVs
through the ACC/IG Gatekeeper. SAVs will not be accomplished within 120 days of a

storage of the assets must conform to requirements listed in AFMAN 91-201.
7.5.4.1. (Added) Each person identified to serve as a potential board member will be trained
within 1 month. Previous members of mishap boards should be used to contribute lessons and
techniques that they learned. Training may use any combination of personal briefings and written
or audiovisual materials. Refresher training should be given annually to review AFI 91-204
requirements and update previously trained individuals on new rules, techniques, or lessons
learned. Recommend a review of applicable portions of the mishap response plan and the
contents of the investigation kit during this training. Note: Board Presidents Training. NAF/DRU
safety offices will ensure their units schedule all prospective Board Presidents for AFSC
SIB/AIB President‗s training as soon as possible.
7.8. (Added) Flight Safety Councils (FSC): Each base conducting flight operations will have
a (FSC) or equivalent. The FSC is chaired by the installation commander or by the
commander's designee. The FSC is a forum for open and proactive discussion of flight safety
issues in an integrated, multidisciplinary fashion. The FSC will advise the commander on flight
safety related matters and recommend actions for identified areas of concern. The FSC should
meet at least once per half year and may meet in conjunction with the quarterly safety council.

Chief and other senior officials deemed necessary to conduct the business of the council. ACC
units that are tenants on other MAJCOM installations are encouraged to participate in equivalent
host unit forums. However, if the host does not have an equivalent, the FSC should be conducted
to provide a vehicle for formally identifying flight safety concerns to the host and higher
headquarters. Ensure members are briefed on safety-privileged information, if applicable.
7.8.2. (Added) The wing FSO should ensure distribution of an agenda, with provisions for
additions in advance, and publication of council meeting minutes. The council chairperson
approves the minutes. All council members receive copies of the minutes. OPRs are identified
for items requiring action. Ensure all privileged information is marked appropriately.

headquarters to the appropriate ACC Safety, Health and Fire Prevention office. AFOSH and
OSHA standards take precedence over fire, safety, and health guidance in functional area
directives and technical orders if the AFOSH and OSHA standards are more restrictive.
8.8.1. Each ACC installation ground safety office is the single point of contact regarding DoL,
OSH, and state OSHA visits or inspections. This ensures that entry control officials will not have
to decide which functions (safety, health, or fire prevention) to contact. Ground safety
coordinates all OSH-related visits with the bioenvironmental engineering office or base fire
chief, as appropriate, as soon as possible. Ground safety includes the appropriate agency,

bioenvironmental engineering or fire protection flight in the in-brief. A representative for the
appropriate agency accompanies the DoL inspector.
8.8.5. Upon arrival of OSHA representatives on the installation, the unit ground safety office
will immediately notify their NAF/SEG (if applicable, USAF Warfare Center/SEG) and
ACC/SEG of any state or federal DoL safety, fire and/or health-related inspection or request for
in-house investigation of a complaint. Accomplish this telephonically or by e-mail, whichever
provides the fastest response. ACC/SEG in turn notifies ACC/SGOP, ACC/A7XF and HQ
AFSEC/SEGO of all state or federal DoL inspections.
8.12. (Added) Industrial Safety Training Programs. Safety personnel assigned to units with
aircraft who have responsibilities to inspect units with a flying mission will attend Training
Detachment (TD), Aircraft Maintenance Qualification Program (AMQP) familiarization training
courses, when available, or receive training from the FSO/FSNCO, during their first 6 months of
assignment. Training must be documented to satisfy this requirement.
9.4.7. This briefing will be included as part of the Commander‘s Orientation when possible
(Ref: para 2.3.1.). WSMs will brief all Commanders in their organization to include those below
group level.
9.4.9. Document annual review showing as a minimum operation, maintenance,
communications and civil engineer review. ACC Wings who are tenant will document reviews
showing operations and maintenance review.
9.4.11. (Added) Coordinate on applicable AFTO Form 22, Technical Order Improvement
Report and Reply.
9.5.4. (Added) Ensure development of unit weapons safety management/continuity book.
9.11. Full-time WSMs will attend the ACC Weapons Safety Program Managers course
(3J5ACC2W0X1) no later than six months after assumption of WSM responsibilities. Weapons
Safety USR‘s are highly encouraged to attend.
9.11.2. Overdue individuals will not perform any explosives or weapons related duty until
training requirements are satisfied.
9.11.3. (Added) Weapons safety training for TO 11A-1-33, Handling and Maintenance of
Explosives Loaded Aircraft, will be provided to all personnel who may be dispatched to work on
explosives loaded aircraft. This training is required initially and every 15 months (not later than
the end of the month in which the initial training was conducted) thereafter. The training will
include how to identify armed aircraft and a familiarization of the hazards involved when
working on or around explosives loaded aircraft.
9.11.4. (Added) Lesson plans and tests:
9.11.4.1. (Added) The lesson plan for weapons safety training will be developed IAW
Attachment 21. The Air Force Munitions Explosives Safety Training CBT may be used to meet
items A21.1 through A21.1.16. Any lesson plan changes or additions made by the OPR after
approval must be coordinated with the wing safety office. Nuclear surety lesson plans requires
approval as prescribed by AFI 91-101_ACCSUP. The WSM will review each lesson plan prior
to implementation and annually thereafter.
AFI 91-202_ACCSUP 9 OCTOBER 2012                                                              11


9.11.4.2. (Added) Tests will be prepared by the OPR and coordinated with the wing safety
office. Individuals receiving weapons safety training must be given a closed book test at the
conclusion of each training session. Test failures will receive immediate corrective training
(classroom or self-study) and retest. The minimum number of test questions will be determined
by training program objectives. The minimum passing grade is 80 percent. At least two distinctly
different tests must be available and used. Change 25% of questions on primary and alternate test
annually. The same questions rearranged, or with the multiple choices rearranged, are not
considered ―distinctively different.‖

                          WEAPONS SAFETY MANNING PLAN

A20.1. Requirement: It is critical for the Air Force to recruit strong performers into Weapons
Safety. Weapons Safety positions are filled by 2WXXX and 2MXXX NCOs using a Special
Experience Identifier (SEI). Most assigned individuals will be assigned to Weapons Safety only
once, for a two to three year period, in their career. Superior performers may be assigned two or
more times in increasingly challenging Weapons Safety positions. It is therefore essential that
candidates be fast learning, highly motivated individuals.
A20.2. Recruitment: The above requirement makes it necessary for individuals in the safety
office to actively recruit, whenever possible, when they are in units with the appropriate AFSCs.
Also, the Chief of Safety should be in close contact with the Logistics Group and appropriate
squadron commanders identifying well suited candidates. Wing staff experience, the ability to
work both flight line and munitions storage issues, and an opportunity to broaden an individual‘s
experience by learning the safety discipline, are all reasons for an individual to volunteer for
Weapons Safety. The communicative skills and wide range of responsibilities inherent in the
position are all desirable abilities for a potential senior NCO to have.
A20.3. Selection Process: When an individual volunteers to be assigned to Weapons Safety
they should go to the Safety office on the base they are assigned and be interviewed by the Chief
of Safety. Names of candidates who are well suited for assignment will be forwarded by the
Chief of Safety to the MPS. The MPS will then notify AFPC of the individual‘s eligibility and
desires. Prior to assignment if possible, the MAJCOM will send the individual TDY to the
Weapons Safety School. If possible the TDY should be accomplished in conjunction with the
PCS.
