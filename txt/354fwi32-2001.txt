                     OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE OF FIRE PREVENTION

1.1. Objective: The objectives of the fire prevention and protection programs are to eliminate
the cause of fires and reduce the loss of life, injury, and property damage if a fire occurs.
Achievement of these objectives requires commander’s support at all levels, and the participation
of all base personnel (both military and civilian), thus ensuring accomplishment of our assigned
Air Force mission.
1.2. Responsibilities:
     1.2.1. 354th Mission Support Group (MSG) Commander: The 354 MSG/CC exercises
     primary responsibility through the Base Civil Engineer. The 354 MSG/CC will be notified
     when a hazard creating an imminently dangerous situation cannot be resolved by concerned
     parties to determine if it should be eliminated, an operation should be discontinued, or if
     implementation of interim controls will be necessary to reduce the risk posed by the
     situation.
     1.2.2. Unit Commanders: Unit commanders are responsible for overall fire safety within
     their unit. Unit commanders will:
        1.2.2.1. Appoint a Unit Fire Safety Representative (UFSR) and alternate in writing to
        354 CES/CEFT within 90 days.
        1.2.2.2. Approve an operating instruction describing general and specialized fire safety
        requirements for operation within their unit.
        1.2.2.3. Conduct semiannual reviews of the unit fire safety program.
        1.2.2.4. Ensure emergency action plans/fire drills are conducted for personnel occupying
        their facilities per Uniform Fire Codes or at the direction of their commander.
        1.2.2.5. Ensure all newly assigned personnel, both military and civilian, receive fire
        prevention training within 30 days of assignment.
     1.2.3. Supervisors: Supervisors at all levels are responsible for fire safety for their work
     areas and operations. This includes briefing personnel on the fire reporting procedures,
     enforcing safe smoking practices, conducting daily fire inspections, and inspecting fire
     extinguishers for proper placement and operational readiness, etc. The supervisor is also
     responsible for providing fire/safety training.
     1.2.4. Unit Fire Safety Representative will:
        1.2.4.1. These individuals are responsible to their unit commanders to develop
        procedures for the fire safe conditions of the facilities under their jurisdiction. Unit Fire
        Safety Reps, upon assignment, must contact the fire prevention section and schedule a
        briefing that will cover their duties and responsibilities for fire prevention matters within
        30 days.
        1.2.4.2. Inspect all fire extinguishers, standpipes, fire doors, and exits to ensure proper
        condition and operation. Remove snow and ice from all exterior exits, hydrants, fire

     department connections, gas valves, mechanical rooms, fire escapes, and post indicator
     valves.
     1.2.4.3. Accompany fire inspectors during fire prevention visits, and provide keys for all
     locked rooms, storage areas, vaults, security areas, and so forth. This includes all
     unaccompanied enlisted personnel housing (UEPH), visiting officers quarters (VOQ),
     and temporary living facilities (TLF).
     1.2.4.4. Ensure all personnel are familiar with activation of the fire alarm systems,
     location of exits, evacuation procedures, fire reporting procedures, and proper use of the
     types of extinguishers assigned.
     1.2.4.5. Enforce safe smoking practices and supervision of designated smoking areas.
     1.2.4.6. Enforce all provisions of this instruction and report any unsafe fire conditions
     beyond their control to the unit commander and the Fire Protection Flight.
     1.2.4.7. Report all known fires to the fire department regardless of size or type.
     Additionally, report any condition that could result in a fire or create a hazardous
     situation must be reported immediately.
     1.2.4.8. Inspect items as required, but not limited to attachment Checklist #1 - 354 FWI

        FIRE AND EMERGENCY REPORTING METHODS AND PROCEDURES

2.1. On Base Reporting: The primary means of reporting a fire from any phone on base to
include housing, government facilities, pay phones, etc. is by dialing the emergency number 911.
Direct phone lines and radio notification also can be used. Individuals discovering fire alarms
sounding a fire or evidence of a fire, regardless of how minor in nature or whether it has been
extinguished, must report it to the Eielson Fire & Emergency Services Flight. NOTE: Give
name, address, telephone number, where fire is located, nature of the fire, and any other pertinent
information.
     2.1.1. When using the 911 Emergency Reporting System from a cell phone it will go directly
     to Fairbanks. The caller must inform the operator that this is an Eielson AFB emergency and
     the operator will transfer them to the 911 systems on base.
354FWI32-2001 4 JANUARY 2012                                                                     5

                    FIRE EXIT DRILLS/EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS

3.1. Fire Drills: Fire drills will be conducted according to occupancy. Occupants should be
familiar with the fire reporting procedures by remembering these steps: S-P-E-E-D.
S - Sound the Alarm

P - Phone 911

E - Evacuate the building

E - Extinguish fire if safely possible

D - Direct fire crews to the emergency
   3.1.1. Each facility will have an Emergency Action Plan in accordance with AFOSH Std 91-
   501. Facilities housing special activities may require more frequent drills; examples are
   Clinics require quarterly fire drills and child day care facilities require monthly fire drills.
   Munitions storage areas require semiannual fire drills.
