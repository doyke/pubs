Supervision,15 September 2011. Unit supplementary material is indicated by
AAFB. This instruction applies to all aircrew members assigned or attached to the 36 OG
including expeditionary active duty, ANG and AFRC units assigned to 36 OG. This supplement
describes 36 OG procedures, responsibilities, requirements and training for Operations
Supervision used in conjunction with the basic instruction. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using AF Form
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.” Ensure that all records created as a result of

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This supplement has been extensively changed and should be completely reviewed. Paragraphs
were realigned to match the current AFI 11-418. Authority was granted to 36 OG/CD to act for
36 OG/CC. Information in the parent regulation, repeated information and extraneous
information has been removed from this supplement. Local Area is redefined.
 2                                            AFI11-418_ANDERSONAFBSUP 7 JUNE 2012


1.4. (Added) Using authority from paragraph 10.1., the 36 OG/CC may delegate 36 OG/CD
to perform any duty designated to the OG/CC in this instruction. Authority is automatically
delegated when the 36 OG/CC is unavailable.
2.2.2. (Added) When squadron Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup)/Top 3 includes individuals
other than the squadron commander, operations officer, assistant operations officer or flight
commander, the squadron commanders will submit the Operations Supervisor Appointment
Letter (Attachment 5) to 36 OG/CC for approval. Once approved, this letter will be maintained
by the expeditionary squadron Stan/Eval officer and Squadron Aviation Resource Manager
(SARM) office for the remainder of the deployment.
3.2.1. (Added) When there are bombers airborne out of the local area that will be returning to
AAFB, there will be a Bomber Recall SOF on call per Table 1, Note 1. The Recall SOF will be
able to report to the tower or airfield within 15 minutes of notification.
3.2.2. (Added) Minimum required supervision for a Functional Check Flight (FCF) is an Ops
Sup on duty in the expeditionary squadron operations facility or the control tower. The Ops Sup
will have communications ability with the FCF aircraft. A SOF is not required for an FCF.
Expeditionary squadrons may impose more restrictive supervision requirements if desired with
coordination from the 36 OG/CC or 36 OG/CD.
4.3.1.1. (Added) Opening SOF will report to the tower no later than one hour prior to the first
scheduled engine start for fighter or bomber aircraft. Prior to reporting to the tower, the Opening
SOF will:
4.3.1.1.1. (Added) Receive a face-to-face weather briefing. This can be accomplished with
expeditionary or 36 OSS weather support personnel.
4.3.1.1.2. (Added) Check NOTAMs. Individual squadrons will check applicable NOTAMs
based on airfield suitability and mission requirements.
4.3.1.1.3. (Added) Obtain the airfield status from Base Ops and ensure Airfield Ops has
conducted a FOD check of the taxiways and runway.
4.3.1.1.4. (Added) Review the wing flying schedule. This is posted daily in the SOF folder on
the OG Shared Drive. Call Command Post with any questions related to Distinguished Visitors,
Transient Aircraft, or any portion of the Wing Flying Schedule (366-2981) and inform the 36
OG/CC or 36 OG/CD of any changes.
4.3.1.1.5. (Added) Determine the Alternate/Divert status for all applicable missions.
4.3.1.2. (Added) There will be a SOF on duty when fighter or bomber aircraft assigned or
attached to AAFB are airborne (sorties that originate and land-off-station are excluded).
4.3.1.3. (Added) The “Local Area” is defined as within 250 NM of AAFB.
4.3.2.2. (Added) When the SOF needs assistance with local dissimilar aircraft, they will
contact the applicable Ops Sup or duty IP at the operations duty desk.
4.3.7.1. (Added) The SOF, in close coordination with the tower watch supervisor, will be the
primary authority and source for determining bird status.
4.3.10.1. (Added) Each SOF will fill out and email to 36 OG/CC, 36 OG/CD, 36 OG/ OGV
and EBS/CC and/or EFS/CC a SOF End-of-Tour Report (Attachment 10) describing all
AFI11-418_ANDERSONAFBSUP 7 JUNE 2012                                                              3


significant occurrences in sufficient detail to permit follow-up staff action. This report will also
contain any deficiencies with the Operations Supervision Program and equipment. The SOF
Program Manager will review all tour reports and forward as necessary to appropriate (or
requested) agencies and maintain an electronic copy on file for 90 days at \\52ajjy-fs-004\36
OG_Shared1\36 OG\OGV\14. Supervisor of Flying\End of Tour Report.
4.3.12. (Added) Visiting units may supplement the 36 OG SOF either in the tower or at their
squadron operations facility. During times when both a 36 OG SOF and a visiting unit SOF are
in the tower, the 36 OG SOF has the ultimate authority for overall flight operations.
4.3.13. (Added) The SOF callsign will be “FOXTROT.”
4.4.1.1. (Added) All deployed squadrons conducting flying operations at AAFB will ensure a
Ops Sup or Duty IP is available to assist the SOF with dissimilar aircraft operations.
5.1.1.1. (Added) The primary discrete emergency frequency for AAFB is 238.050.
5.1.9. (Added) When notified of an aircraft IFE, SOF actions are located in the SOF’s Aircraft
Emergency Checklist maintained in the SOF Binder. These checklists are also available
electronically    in    the     SOF       Folder    on      Andersen        SharePoint     at:
https://andersen.eim.pacaf.af.mil/sites/OG_OGV/SOF/SOF Checklist/
6.2.4. (Added) When the SOF is in the tower, SOF changeover will occur at the tower. If
there is only a Recall SOF on duty prior to assuming SOF duties in the tower, the oncoming SOF
may proceed directly to the tower and begin SOF duties with no required face-to-face
changeover. Upon arriving at the tower, the SOF will contact the applicable operations duty
desk to inform the Recall SOF that they have assumed SOF duties. Similarly, if the tower SOF’s
shift ends and they are replaced by a Recall SOF, the departing tower SOF will notify the
applicable operations duty desk to inform the Recall SOF that they are passing control.
6.2.5. (Added) When proceeding directly to the tower and not performing a face-to-face
changeover, ensure all Opening SOF items of section 4.3.1.1 are accomplished.
6.3.2. (Added) The SOF vehicle on the airfield is the alternate SOF duty location.
6.4.1.3. (Added) Minimum required equipment for the SOF is a UHF radio and LMR normally
maintined in the tower. When outside of the tower, the SOF will bring the LMR. The SOF
vehicle is equipped with a UHF radio. If there is a Recall SOF on duty, the Recall SOF will have
the SOF cell phone. When the SOF is not at Bomber Ops, they will have the SOF Cell Phone
with them at all times.
6.4.3.1. (Added) The SOF vehicle is dedicated to airfield functions. The vehicle will only be
used by the SOF on duty and will remain on base. The vehicle will not be used when there is no
SOF or Recall SOF on duty.
6.4.4.1. (Added) SOF Quick Reaction Checklists (QRCs) will be maintained in the tower in
the SOF Binder and will be available electronically in the SOF Folder on the Andersen
SharePoint (https://andersen.eim.pacaf.af.mil/sites/OG_OGV/SOF/SOF Checklist/). The 36
OG/OGV will be responsible for updating SOF QRCs. At a minimum, 36 OG/OGV will review
SOF QRCs for applicability and currency with each rotation of expeditionary squadrons at
AAFB.

6.5.6. (Added) A SOF will be eligible for upgrade to “Instructor SOF” after completion of six
unsupervised tours following certification.
6.6.2. (Added) The 36 OG/CC will approve individuals nominated to enter SOF training that
were not previously certified.
6.6.8. (Added) Expeditionary Squadron SOF
6.6.8.1. (Added)     For deployed individuals certified as SOF at their home station, the
requirements to be SOF certified at AAFB include:
6.6.8.1.1. (Added) Review of local directives including: 36 WGI 13-202, AAFB Supp to AFI
11-418, 36 OG SOF Quick Reaction Checklists and 36 OG SOF Read File.
6.6.8.1.2. (Added) A 36 OG/CC or 36 OG/CD interview. Expeditionary squadrons will
submit a list of qualified SOFs via the SOF Appointment Letter (Attachment 6) for
signature/approval. The SOF interview will be part of the initial meeting with the 36 OG/CC.
6.6.8.2. (Added) For deployed individuals not qualified as SOF at their home station, SOF
Upgrade Training must be accomplished in accordance with the SOF Certification and Training
Letter (Attachment 8). Expeditionary squadron commanders will first nominate individuals for
entry into the SOF program via a SOF Nomination Letter (Attachment 7).
6.6.8.3. (Added) Deployed individuals annotated as “Instructor SOF” at home station in
accordance with paragraph 6.5. of AFI 11-418, will be considered qualified to upgrade like-MDS
aircrew to SOF at AAFB upon completion of an interview with the 36 OG/CC.
6.6.9. (Added) TDY Unit SOFs. If TDY units are required to perform SOF duties, they will
provide 36 OG/OGV with a list of their SOFs with name, rank and SSAN to ensure access to the
tower.     Visiting SOFs will receive a briefing from 36 OG/OGV, 36 OG/CD, or
36 OG/CC on SOF procedures and complete an interview with the 36 OG/CC or 36 OG/CD
prior to assuming SOF duties.
6.8.1. (Added) Semiannual meetings will be held by units scheduled to remain on AAFB more
than 160 days. This meeting will be scheduled approximately halfway through the
TDY/deployment to provide updates and feedback on operations. Based on the expeditionary
nature of the 36 OG and the fact that there are no permanently assigned flying squadrons, this
meeting, or the initial SOF meeting, will be the semiannual meeting. The 36 OG/OGV should
consider including discussions on scenarios related to recent events or possible focus areas based
on upcoming events or seasonal interest items. Minutes from this meeting will capture all
pertinent data and will be posted in the SOF Read File.
6.9.1. (Added) The 36 OG/OGV is the OPR for the SOF Program.
6.9.2.11. (Added) The 36 OG/OGV will ensure expeditionary squadrons provide the
36 OG/CC with a list of home station qualified SOFs for approval as 36 OG SOFs (Attachment
6). The 36 OG/OGV will also ensure expeditionary squadrons provide 36 OSS/OSAT with an
Entry Access List (EAL) for the control tower (Attachment 9). Expeditionary squadrons will
also provide 36 OSS/OSAT an updated list of SOFs if individuals upgrade to SOF while at
AAFB.
6.9.2.12. (Added) The 36 OG/OGV will be the point of contact for coordination with units
TDY to AAFB. The 36 OG/OGV will coordinate with visiting units to ensure Ops Sup
AFI11-418_ANDERSONAFBSUP 7 JUNE 2012                                                    5


requirements are met. Visiting units will inform 36 OG/OGV of planned flying schedules and
36 OG/OGV will relay basic SOF requirements to all visiting units.
6.9.3. (Added) Expeditionary squadrons will retain certification and continuation training
records until returning to home station.
7.4. (Added)   Local procedures are contained in the SOF QRC.
8.1. (Added) The 36 OG/OGV is the OPR for the Operations Supervision Program.
8.4. (Added) A SOF Read File will be maintained by 36 OG/OGV to provide SOFs with
updates involving SOF operations. SOFs will ensure they have signed off all SOF Read Files
prior to assuming duty. The Read Files will be located in the tower and are available
electronically in the SOF Folder on the 36 OG Shared Drive or SharePoint. The 36 OG/OGV
will check Read Files for applicability upon arrival of expeditionary squadrons.
10.1.1. (Added) The 36 OG/CC may delegate waiver authority to the 36 OG/CD.
