SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This change provides new guidance reducing the High Year Tenure (HYT) for all, technical
sergeants (TSgts), master sergeants (MSgts), and senior master sergeants (SMSgts).
Additionally, this change establishes an HYT based off a specific total active federal military
service date (TAFMSD) for applicable ranks that are affected by the HYT reduction. A margin
bar (/) indicates newly revised material.

  GENERAL INFORMATION, PLACE OF RETIREMENT AND RESTRICTIONS ON
                          RETIREMENTS

Section 2A—— General Information

2.1. Eligibility.
   2.1.1. To be eligible for non-disability retirement, officers and enlisted members must
   complete 20 years of total active federal military service (TAFMS). If members are officers
   and they wish to retire in an officer grade, they must have 10 years of active commissioned
   service.
       2.1.1.1. All Air Force active duty enlisted members desiring voluntary retirement must
       request retirement on an AF IMT 1160. Officers who wish to retire on a date earlier than,
       or on, their mandatory separation date (MSD) must request retirement on an AF IMT
       1160. (See Chapter 4 for mandatory retirement, required by Title 10 USC, for Regular
       and certain Reserve officers.) Other than Regular and certain Reserve officers who are
       retired on their MSD, all active duty members will be separated on their Date of
       Separation (DOS) if they have not requested and been approved for a voluntary
       retirement. The following examples are provided:
           2.1.1.1.1. If a Regular officer desires to retire on a date earlier than the MSD (or in a
           voluntary status on that MSD), an application must be submitted.
           2.1.1.1.2. If a Reserve officer desires retirement on the involuntary DOS established
           upon completion of 20 years of active duty (or first retirement eligibility as an
           officer), an application must be submitted.
           2.1.1.1.3. If an active duty enlisted member desires retirement on their HYT date, the
           member must submit a retirement application.
   2.1.2. Officers must have 10 years of total active federal commissioned service to retire as
   an officer (10 USC §8911).
   2.1.3. Unless granted a waiver under some provision of law, to be eligible for voluntary
   retirement in a grade above major, a commissioned officer must have served on active duty in
   that higher grade for not less than three years or they will retire in the next lower grade as
   directed by 10 USC §1370.
   2.1.4. If the member will be retirement eligible as of the requested retirement date, the
   member may complete a retirement application prior to completing the minimum required
   service if the member is not prohibited or restricted by reasons listed in Table 2.1, Table 2.2
   or paragraph 3.2 If no restrictions apply, the application may be submitted up to 12 months,
   but no less than 120 days in advance of the desired retirement date, which should include any
   intended terminal leave or permissive temporary duty (PTDY).
       2.1.4.1. Retirement applications submitted under the assignment declination for officers
       or the 7-day option (7DO) for enlisted members follow time limits specified in AFI 36-
       2110, Assignments, paragraph 2.37.).
10                                                           AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


     2.1.5. Only Regular officers and certain Reserve officers are subject to mandatory
     retirement, required under Title 10, USC and must take place on the date set by the statute
     that applies (see Chapter 4). Officers who have an MSD must retire no later than that date
     even if previously approved for a voluntary retirement at a later date.

Section 2B—— Place of Retirement

2.2. General Rules.
     2.2.1. A member may retire in:
        2.2.1.1. The Continental United States (CONUS). Members assigned to a duty station in
        the CONUS retire at that duty station.
        2.2.1.2. Overseas. Members serving overseas (including Alaska, Hawaii, or a US
        territory possession) retire at the overseas duty station (see paragraph 2.3.) or, if
        approved, at a separation processing base (SPB) (see paragraph 2.4).
     2.2.2. Do not change the unit of assignment or permanent duty station of members who are
     within 8 months of retirement without first notifying the applicable office: EXCEPTION:
     You may move members because of unit deactivation, change of unit, or duty station for
     those who receive notice to start processing for mandatory retirement.
        2.2.2.1. HQ AFPC/DPPRR, 550 C Street West, Suite 3, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4713
        for members in the grade of lieutenant colonel and below. EXCEPTION: The Chiefs
        Management Office (AF/DPE), 550 C Street West, Suite 30, Randolph AFB TX 78150-
        4732 should be notified for CMSgts.
        2.2.2.2. For colonels and colonel selectees, AF/DPO, Crystal Plaza 6, 2221 South Clark

        2.2.2.3. For general officers, AF/DPG will give instructions.
     2.2.3. See paragraph 2.4.1 for procedures of assigning members to an authorized place of
     retirement that is based on publication of retirement orders.
2.3. Overseas Duty Station. Members who are serving at an overseas duty station at the time
of their retirement may retire at the overseas base to:
     2.3.1. Live permanently in that country. Prior to the date of retirement, members and their
     family must comply with command and host government residency rules.
     2.3.2. Live temporarily in that country and later move to a final overseas or CONUS home
     of selection (HOS) within the 1-year time limit set in the Joint Federal Travel Regulation
     (JFTR, U-5365). Members and family members must comply with command and host
     government residency rules.
     2.3.3. Move immediately to another overseas site as a final HOS by the most direct route as
     determined by the Traffic Management Office (TMF). Members and their family must
     comply with the overseas HOS command and host government residency rules.
     2.3.4. Move directly from the overseas duty station to the final HOS in CONUS. Members
     and family members must comply with command and host government residency rules.
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                      11


   Member must take at least 5 days of PTDY or terminal leave to use this option. Additionally,
   members must call AFPC/ DPPRS (1-800-472-3654) to confirm arrival in the States.
   2.3.5. The MPF will monitor the member’s retirement processing for completion (including
   a retirement physical examination, if requested) and, if requested by the member, assure that
   a retirement ceremony is held at the member’s duty station before the member travels to
   HOS in another overseas location.
   2.3.6. HQ AFPC/DPSOR or AF/DPG, as appropriate, will not issue “Permanent Change of
   Station (PCS) without Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA)” orders for members who
   designate a home of selection elsewhere overseas (see paragraph 2.13.2).
   2.3.7. Members will not be allowed to retire overseas without meeting host country
   residency requirements prior to their projected date of separation. MPF/S ensures members
   meet country requirements or ensures members have made proper arrangements to depart the
   overseas location. MPF/S ensures members not taking permissive TDY or terminal leave in
   conjunction with retirement depart the overseas area with sufficient travel time to reach the
   CONUS by their retirement date. If a member’s travel is delayed due to a missed flight, etc,
   and the member will not be able to reach the CONUS before the projected retirement date,
   the MPF/S must contact the orders publishing authority as soon as possible for processing
   instructions.
2.4. Separation Processing Base (SPB). Members assigned overseas will complete processing
at their current location unless approval is granted for travel to a SPB. A SPB is an Air Force
base in the CONUS with a Military Personnel Flight/Section (MPF/S) and Financial Services
Office (FSO) nearest to the member’s projected HOS.
   2.4.1. If support facilities do not exist at the member’s overseas location, a hardship exists
   that warrants travel to a SPB, or travel to a SPB would be in the best interest of the Air Force,
   member will submit a request, which includes full justification and concurrence of the
   member’s commander, to HQ AFPC/DPSOR (for colonels and below) or AF/DPG (for
   general officers and general officer selectees) as appropriate.              If approved, HQ
   AFPC/DPSOR or AF/DPG, as applicable, will determine the appropriate SPB closest to the
   member’s HOS and prepare travel orders directing movement.
   2.4.2. Members retiring at the SPB have 1 year from the retirement date to make a final HOS
   move from the area of the SPB to anywhere in the US.
   2.4.3. Members not authorized HOS allowances may receive travel and transportation
   allowances from their last base to the place they actually travel, with reimbursement not to
   exceed returning to their home of record (HOR) or the place they entered into active duty
   (PLEAD).
   2.4.4. DELETED.
2.5. Overseas Processing Base Responsibilities.
   2.5.1. HQ AFPC/DPSOR (for colonels and below) or AF/DPG (for general officers and
   general officer selectees) publishes PCS without PCA orders on retiring members approved
   for travel to a SPB (see paragraph 2.4.1.1.). For all other members retiring from overseas,
   the publishing authority includes appropriate travel authorizations on the retirement orders.
12                                                           AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


     2.5.2. After the MPF receives retirement orders, the MPF issues PCS without PCA orders
     that assign the member to the SPBC. No orders are needed if member is retiring overseas.
     2.5.3. The MPF also:
        2.5.3.1. Gives 25 copies of the retirement order to the member. If the member is retiring
        overseas, the MPF keeps any remaining copies for its own use.
        2.5.3.2. If member is authorized travel to SPB, notifies the SPB MPF/S at least 5
        workdays before member’s departure, providing arrival date, retirement effective date,
        PTDY, terminal leave, and any other pertinent data.
        2.5.3.3. Ensures member’s projected departure from the overseas area allows member to
        report to SPB, if applicable, no earlier than 3 workdays, and no later than 1 workday
        before start of permissive TDY/terminal leave/retirement effective date.
        2.5.3.4. Evaluates mode of travel, travel time required, and time required to deliver and
        pickup a privately owned vehicle (POV) at port and schedules the member's departure
        date.
        2.5.3.5. Counsels about provisions in the JFTR for the member’s and family’s travel
        rights and entitlements and for transportation of household goods (HHG) to a retirement
        HOS.
        2.5.3.6. DELETED.
        2.5.3.7. Advises that travel pay is limited to the cost of traveling from the overseas duty
        station to the processing base to the final HOS, or from the overseas duty station directly
        to the HOS.
        2.5.3.8. DELETED.
        2.5.3.9. Ensures member has contacted HQ AFPC/DPSOY regarding preparation of DD
        Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty. Member will be
        provided completed DD Form 214 after retirement effective date to avoid legal and
        jurisdictional problems, along with violation of the Status of Forces Agreement the US
        government has with the host country.
     2.5.4. DELETED.
        2.5.4.1. DELETED.
     2.5.5. The overseas processing base MPF/S notifies HQ AFPC/DPSOR (or AF/DPG,
     AF/DPO, or AF/DPE, as appropriate) if they have not received retirement orders within 60
     days of the member’s projected departure date.
2.6. Separation Processing Base (SPB) Responsibilities. The SPB MPF/S:
     2.6.1. Retrieves identification cards and passports. Ensures member meets new ID card
     requirements. Ensures member completes any desired processing, such as the Transition
     Assistance Program, and contacts the FSO to complete a travel voucher prior to departing on
     permissive TDY/terminal leave.
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    13


   2.6.2. If the member requests withdrawal of retirement or change of retirement date, the SPB
   helps the member submit the request through the virtual MPF (self-service actions). The local
   commander will review and provide a recommendation via the virtual MPF.
   2.6.3. The MPF/S notifies the overseas MPF/S if member fails to report within 72 hours of
   scheduled retirement processing date.
   2.6.4. DELETED.
   2.6.5. DELETED.
   2.6.6. DELETED.

members with a copy of either Attachment 4 or Attachment 5, as appropriate, and advises them
to contact the Traffic Management Flight (TMF).
   2.7.1. The TMF will brief the members on their travel and transportation options specified in
   the JFTR.
   2.7.2. The MPF computes the travel time depending on the mode of travel. Credit 1 day if by
   air transportation and 1 day for every 350 miles if travel is by POV. Give members 1 day
   each to deliver and pick up a POV at a port. Allow 3 days if a Friday is involved.
   2.7.3. The FSO may give a member advanced travel pay from the overseas duty station to
   the port of embarkation and from the CONUS port of debarkation to the separation base or
   HOS. Advance travel pay from a processing base to a HOS is subject to the limits in the
   JFTR, paragraph U5165.
       2.7.3.1. Retiring members submit a final travel voucher to the processing base FSO.
       2.7.3.2. There may be a difference between what a member is entitled in travel pay and
       what entitlements apply for family members. The MPF makes sure that members
       understand what travel entitlements are pertinent to them and their family members.
2.8. Leave in Connection with Retirement. The member’s commander must approve PTDY
and terminal leave. Members who wish to take PTDY and/or terminal leave in connection with
their retirement must apply for retirement at least 120 days before the desired PTDY and
terminal leave. Members may not depart on terminal leave or PTDY until receipt of retirement
orders.
   2.8.1. If the member is authorized travel to a SPB, HQ AFPC/DPSOR or AF/DPG, as
   appropriate, assigns the member PCS without PCA for retirement processing as specified in
   paragraph 2.4.
       2.8.1.1. Before approving the leave, the overseas commander gets the member's
       signature on the below statement and forwards it to the MPF Relocation Office to file in
       the relocation folder:
“I understand that approval of my request for leave in connection with my retirement, if granted,
is only for my personal benefit and convenience. I agree to be in a leave status and to depart on
the date I have shown in my leave request, or as soon as the CONUS MPF completes my
processing. I will not return to a duty status before the date of my retirement.”
14                                                            AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


     2.8.2. Some retiring members may take special leave accrual (SLA) in excess of 60 days.
     Members retiring under the assignment declination or 7DO (see paragraph 2.19), who do not
     have enough time to finish retirement processing and also take this SLA, retire the 1st day of
     the 2nd month following the date eligible for return from overseas (DEROS).
        2.8.2.1. The MPF delays the date of member’s return to comply with the reporting
        instructions and enters code “72” (Retirement under assignment declination or 7DO) in
        the military personnel data system (MilPDS).
     2.8.3. Personnel who are granted terminal leave or PTDY in connection with retirement
     remain assigned to their units. Leave taken before a member’s DEROS is not a tour
     curtailment so is not a basis for getting an early replacement.
2.9. Permissive Temporary Duty (PTDY) in Connection with Retirement. Members retiring
for years of service may be authorized PTDY (see AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program).
2.10. Application of Medal of Honor Recipient. A retirement application submitted by a
member who has received the Medal of Honor would be processed, even though prohibited by
Table 2.1 or restricted by Table 2.2
2.11. Approval and Disapproval Authority. The SAF is the final authority to approve or
disapprove applications for voluntary retirement. This authority has been delegated to the
Director, Secretary of the Air Force Personnel Council (SAFPC), and to designated Special
Assistants when appropriate. Any application signed by an eligible member and given to the
MPF must be processed unless prohibited by Table 2.1 or restricted by Table 2.2
2.12. Retirement Orders. The appropriate HQ publishes retirement orders. Computer-
generated orders do not require a seal or signature although the word “official” must appear
above the signature element.
     2.12.1. HQ AFPC/DPPRR publishes orders on lieutenant colonels and below retiring from
     extended active duty (EAD).
     2.12.2. AF/DPG publishes retirement orders on general officers and general officer selects.
     AF/DPO publishes retirement orders on colonels and colonel selects. AF/DPE publishes
     retirement orders on CMSgts.
     2.12.3. HQ ARPC/DPPR publishes orders on retiring Reserve members not on EAD.
     2.12.4. When an enlisted member held a commission as an officer at any time and
     previously had 10 years TAFCS, for the member to retire in that commissioned grade, they
     must hold a reserve commission. If the member resigned their commission, they must apply
     to HQ ARPC/DPPRR (see Table 8.2, Rule 1, Note 1). HQ ARPC/DPPRR publishes Reserve
     of the Air Force appointment orders and places the member on the Retired Reserve List.
     Such orders are authorized if they were not previously published when the member separated
     as an officer then enlisted to attain 20 years of active service.
2.13. Publishing Orders. Usually, orders are published as soon as the retirement application is
approved and the member’s service computation is verified, if a fund citation is available for the
requested date of retirement. Allow at least 3 days from the date of approval notice in MilPDS
before asking for status of retirement orders. Orders are not published earlier than 12 months in
advance of the approved retirement date. Retirement requests submitted with no restrictions and
no waiver requests are usually processed immediately with automatically-generated orders.
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    15


  2.13.1. MPFs will not furnish retiring members a letter in lieu of retirement orders to
  authorize their move to a HOS or HOR in conjunction with retirement. The only documents
  that authorize the entitlement are the retirement order or a message from the order-publishing
  authority (see paragraphs 2.12) approving the retirement with the retirement order number
  and the retirement order date. (JFTR, paragraph U5330.G. and Comptroller General Decision
  52 Comp Gen 769 - 1973.)
  2.13.2. Travel of Retired Personnel to Overseas Home of Selection (HOS). Retiring
  members eligible for overseas HOS should have administrative orders prepared by HQ
  AFPC/DPSOR or AF/DPG, as appropriate.
     2.13.2.1. Identification of the individual and dependents. For children, include date of
     birth.
     2.13.2.2. For those traveling by air, the authorization for travel from the appropriate
     aerial port of embarkation (APOE) specifying the flight upon which the individual will
     travel.
     2.13.2.3. Location of individual’s HOS.
     2.13.2.4. Statement that the transportation is “for the purpose of establishing residence
     after retirement.” Also identify the order that effects the retirement.
     2.13.2.5. Air movement designator (AMD).
     2.13.2.6. Authorization for HHG and POV shipment, as appropriate.
     2.13.2.7. Statement that “member is responsible for ensuring that customs, immigration,
     and quarantine entry requirements for establishment of a home in (name of foreign
     country) are met.”
     2.13.2.8. Statement that “travel as directed is necessary in the military service” or “travel
     as directed is necessary (TDN).”
     2.13.2.9. Accounting classification in the individual’s retirement order and the
     parenthetical information shown after the accounting classification, (that is, insert M, D,
     H, I, T, or Y). Also include the customer identification code (CIC) for travel by Air
     Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft and Transportation Account Code (TAC) for services
     rendered by AMC, Military Sealift Command, and Military Traffic Management
     Command (MTMC) (shipment of HHG, unaccompanied baggage, POV).
     2.13.2.10. The authority, JFTR, volume I, paragraph U5130.
     2.13.2.11. EXAMPLE: Major Gerald Fine, 123-45-6789, USAF, Retired, and his
     dependent spouse, Helen J. Fine, are authorized to proceed from McGuire AFB NJ,
     reporting to AMC passenger Service Counter at McGuire not later than (NLT) 1850
     hours, 14 Jan 85 for departure at 2000 hours, on flight T-233, to home of selection
     (HOS), 72 Wilhelmstrasse, Frankfurt Germany, for establishing residence after retirement
     according to Special Order AC-17777, Department of the Air Force (DAF), 1985. AMD:
     WRI FRF 3PC FN-I. Shipment of household goods and POV authorized. Member is
     responsible for ensuring that customs, immigration, and quarantine entry requirements for
     establishing a home in Germany are met. TDN: (Accounting Classification plus
     parenthetical information, CIC, and TAC.) Authority: JFTR, volume 1, paragraph U5130.

2.14. Rescinding and Amending Orders. A retirement order, if regular and valid, is final on
the effective date of retirement. It may only be revoked, rescinded, or amended if there is fraud,
manifest error, mathematical error, mistake of law, or substantial new evidence that renders the
order invalid. The appropriate headquarters may amend or rescind retirement orders in rare
situations when a member is unable to complete retirement processing before the effective
retirement date due to circumstances such as medical hold, civil confinement, late departure from
overseas or when member is subject to the prohibiting conditions in Table 2.1 or restrictions in
Table 2.2
     2.14.1. The MPF immediately notifies HQ AFPC/DPPRR, AF/DPE for CMSgts or AF/DPO
     for colonels and colonel selectees and sends documents to justify amendment or rescission of
     the retirement order. If AFPC/DPPRR (or AF/DPG, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE, as appropriate) is
     not notified promptly, the member must apply to the Air Force Board for Correction of
     Military Records (AFBCMR) for corrective action. Use a computer-generated order to
     amend or rescind the retirement. Retirement orders may be amended up to three (3) times,
     but must be rescinded if additional corrections are needed.
2.15. Reserve Status of Retired Member. A member of an Air Force Reserve component
retired from EAD as an officer after attaining at least 20 years TAFMS automatically transfers to
the Retired Reserve according to 10 USC §10154(1). By policy, the Air Force assigns any other
active duty member who is or becomes a member of the Air Force Reserve at retirement to the
Retired Reserve.
2.16. Retired Members Ordered to Active Duty. When there is a valid requirement, the SAF
may order retired members of the Regular Air Force or of the Retired Reserve, who were retired
under 10 USC §8911 or §8914, back to active duty (10 USC §688) for a 12-month limit within
the 24 months following the first day of the active duty recall. Chaplains, health professionals,
officers serving with the American Battle Monuments Commission, and Defense or Service
Attachés may serve for periods longer than 12 months. Officers retired by selective early
retirement board (SERB) and officers who request retirement after having been notified that they
were to be considered for early retirement under 10 USC §638 but before being considered by
that board, are not recalled to active duty unless by Congress or the President during a time of
war or national emergency (10 USC §688).

Section 2C——Retirement Prohibitions and Waiverable Restrictions

2.17. General Information on Retirement Prohibitions and Restrictions. A number of
conditions can temporarily prohibit or restrict submission of a retirement application. Table 2.1
lists conditions prohibiting initial submission or suspending processing of previously submitted
retirement application or, if one has already been submitted, these conditions suspend further
processing of the application. Waiverable restrictions are contained in Table 2.2 Chapter 3
covers the service necessary for voluntary retirement citing federal laws that apply to retirement.
2.18. Waiver of Restrictions. Members must request a waiver if applying for a retirement date
earlier than their active duty service commitment (ADSC) date or if they have other retirement
restrictions listed in Table 2.2 A request for waiver should not be used solely as a means of
adjusting a tour completion or ADSC date. Instead, members must request an adjustment to the
tour or ADSC in conjunction with their retirement application. If members need a waiver of the
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    17


ADSC or restriction, they must submit their request on the AF IMT 1160 and attach written
justification/documentation.
   2.18.1. Actions by the MPF. The MPF checks the applicable blocks in section I and includes
   the commander’s recommendation. (NOTE: Commander’s signature in Section II of the AF
   IMT 1160 indicates acknowledgment that the member has applied for retirement and whether
   or not the member is subject to retirement restrictions.) If the member is requesting a waiver,
   the commander makes recommendations for waiver approval or disapproval in a separate
   memorandum that contains supporting reasons for the recommendation. Prohibitions in
   Table 2.1 will not be waived. The member may request a waiver of the restrictions listed in
   Table 2.2 for hardship or in the best interest of the Air Force as specified in the pertinent
   rule. To see if a restriction applies, the MPF notes the member’s DEROS, tour completion
   date, or any other ADSC that exists as of the requested retirement date. Using AFI 36-2107,
   Active Duty Service Commitments, the MPF reviews member’s FPRG to verify accuracy of
   the ADSC (inquiry into MilPDS is not sufficient). If the MPF finds errors between what
   ADSC is valid in the member’s FPRG and what is shown in MilPDS, report the discrepancy
   to the proper office and ensure that the ADSC is corrected. Data element codes used for
   MilPDS update for retirement application and waiver request are in Table 2.2 and
   Attachment 6. In Section III of the AF IMT 1160, the MPF checks the appropriate codes and
   completes other requested information. MPF personnel must caution members not to make
   any irrevocable financial commitments on the assumption that their waiver request will be
   approved. Problems resulting from premature commitment may not be used later as a basis
   for hardship waiver request. The waiver approval authority will return applications to the
   MPF without action or disapprove an application without justification or supporting
   documentation for the waiver request. The commander’s recommendation for waiver
   approval or disapproval does not, by itself, constitute justification. The member completes
   the request in accordance with this AFI and then the MPF submits the application to the
   appropriate waiver authority.
   2.18.2. Waiver Requests Based on Hardship. (See Attachment 1, Terms) Applicants must
   explain, in writing, what the hardship is, how retirement will ease or eliminate the hardship,
   show that the hardship condition arose, or worsened, after the ADSC or restriction occurred
   and what other efforts were made to remedy the situation other than changing the retirement
   date (such as a request for humanitarian reassignment, join spouse, etc.). A hardship situation
   cannot be common to other military members in the course of a military career. These are
   common situations: timing of civilian employment, business opportunities, plans for higher
   education or training, ownership of property, family separation, and other inconveniences.
      2.18.2.1. To support the hardship waiver request, detailed documentation must contain
      written statements, letters, or certificates (originals only) from persons who know about
      the situation (such as a doctor or chaplain). For example, if the hardship waiver request is
      based on the disability of a member of the family, a doctor must state what the disability
      is, when it occurred, and the prognosis. The request must explain why other family
      members are unable to give the necessary care and support, and why the member’s
      retirement is the only solution. If the hardship is the result of the death of a family
      member, the basis for waiver might be a need for the member to operate a family
      business or take care of a surviving parent. Statements must be sent with the waiver
18                                                            AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


        request showing the extent of the problem and why the member’s retirement would solve
        it.
        2.18.2.2. Commanders must recommend approval or disapproval of all waiver requests
        based on hardship and give supporting reasons for the recommendation.
     2.18.3. Waiver Requests Based on Best Interest of the Air Force. (See Attachment 1,
     Terms) Applications citing “best interest of the Air Force” as a basis for waiver must clearly
     show how retirement would serve Air Force interests. “Best interest of the Air Force” should
     not be used as a basis for a waiver when an administrative or punitive action may be
     warranted or more appropriate.
        2.18.3.1. Although the member requests the waiver, the commander recommends
        whether the approval would be in the best interests of the Air Force, giving supporting
        reasons for the recommendation.
        2.18.3.2. If the commander bases the recommendation on local manning conditions, the
        MPF chief uses Section IV of the AF IMT 1160 to comment on base-level manning in the
        member’s specialty and actions that have been taken to remedy the situation.
     2.18.4. Waiver Not Required in Certain Cases. The appropriate HQ may approve an
     application indicating an unfulfilled ADSC without a waiver if the member’s retirement date
     coincides with an involuntary DOS, an expiration of term of service (ETS), or upon an
     enlisted member reaching 30 or more years of active military service. The MPF submits
     retirement requests through MilPDS, identifies the appropriate waiver requirement and
     ensures the appropriate reasons for the waiver are reflected on the AF IMT 1160.
2.19. Assignment Declination or Seven-Day Option (7DO). (USE THE FOLLOWING
GUIDANCE ALONG WITH AFI 36-2110, ASSIGNMENTS, PARAGRAPH 2.37 TO
DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY AND EFFECTIVE DATES OF RETIREMENT UNDER
THE 7-DAY OPTION PROGRAM.) Subject to restrictions in Table 2.2, members nominated
or selected for assignment, to include formal training and/or education event, even if PCS is not
involved, are given 7 calendar days after receipt of formal assignment or selection notification to
apply for a retirement date, provided they meet retirement eligibility defined in paragraph 2.1
     2.19.1. When a signed request for retirement (AF IMT 1160) is dated before an assignment
     selection date (ASD) for PCS or selection for training, then normal retirement criteria apply.
     When a signed request for retirement (AF IMT 1160) is the same date or after an ASD for
     PCS or selection date for training, then any request for retirement must be processed under
     assignment declination or 7DO provisions.
        2.19.1.1. The MPF completes AF IMT 1160, Section III, checking the applicable special
        program identifier in blocks 13a and b. The MPF inputs retirement requests in MilPDS,
        with SPEC-PROG-ID code “72”, for assignment declination or 7DO. When an officer
        submits a retirement application under assignment declination provisions, the MPF
        relocation office must immediately notify the applicable assignment office and send a
        courtesy copy of the notification to HQ AFPC/DPPRR (notify AF/DPO for colonels and
        colonel selects or AF/DPE for CMSgts). In the message, include the officer’s
        identification data, the date that the officer was officially notified of the assignment or
        selection notification, and the requested retirement date.
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                       19


       2.19.1.2. When an Airman signs and submits a retirement application under 7DO
       provisions, the MPF relocation office submits a reclama request to cancel the
       nomination/selection for assignment. For CMSgts, notify AF/DPE.
   2.19.2. Effect of Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP), Humanitarian Requests or
   Assignment Reclama on assignment declination or 7DO. The assignment declination or 7DO
   period will not be delayed or extended while the deferment or reclama is in process. If the
   request for reclama, deferment, reassignment for humanitarian or EFMP is disapproved, the
   member can still apply for retirement for hardship or best interest reasons (see paragraph
   2.18).
       2.19.2.1. Approval of an assignment reclama, humanitarian or EFMP request does not in
       itself support withdrawal of a retirement request submitted under assignment declination
       or 7DO. Requests for withdrawal must meet the criteria of paragraph 2.22
       2.19.2.2. Members with a valid hardship may still apply for hardship retirement under
       paragraph 2.18 at any time after the assignment declination or 7DO period has passed if
       they can substantiate that severe personal hardship would otherwise result.
           2.19.2.2.1. If the assignment declination or 7DO period has passed, the MPF enters
           the retirement request into MilPDS using SPEC-PROG-ID code “70” and mails or
           data faxes documented evidence of hardship to HQ AFPC/DPPRR (for lieutenant
           colonels and below), AF/ DPE for CMSgts or AF/DPO for colonels and colonel
           selects.
2.20. Retirement in Conjunction with Noncommissioned Officer Academy (NCOA)
Declination. Enlisted members who decline Noncommissioned Officer Academy (NCOA) or
Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy (SNCOA) attendance will separate on their DOS or
ETS as specified in their current enlistment contract or any extensions thereto. If they obtain 18
years active duty before reaching DOS/ETS, they may remain on active duty and apply for a
retirement date effective the first day of the month after they reach 20 years of TAFMS.
2.21. Retirement in Conjunction with High Year Tenure (HYT) Date. Members request
voluntary retirement to be effective no later than the 1st day of the month following the HYT
date. Enlisted members must voluntarily request retirement (10 USC §8914 & §8917). If an
enlisted member’s retirement application has not been submitted before the DOS, that member
will separate. An active duty service commitment expiring after an enlisted member’s
established HYT date will be automatically waived. The HYT date is set at the following service
points: staff sergeants (SSgt) at 20 years of service; technical sergeants (TSgt) at 22 years of
service; master sergeants (MSgt) at 24 years of service; senior master sergeants (SMSgt) at 26
years of service; and chief master sergeants (CMSgt) at 30 years service (for CMSgts, see
paragraph 2.21.6). (For reenlistment procedures and eligibility, please see AFI 36-2606,
Reenlistment in the United States Air Force). TSgts whose TAFMSD is 31 July 1989 or earlier
will retire no later than the first day of the month following their original HYT date, or no later
than 1 Aug 2011, whichever comes first. TSgts whose TAFMSD is 1 Aug 1989 or later will
have HYT established at the new HYT (22 years). MSgts whose TAFMSD is 31 Mar 1987 or
earlier will retire no later than the first day of the month following their original HYT date, or on
1 Apr 2011, whichever comes first. MSgts whose TAFMSD is 1 Apr 1987 or later will have
HYT established at the new HYT (24 years). SMSgts whose TAFMSD is 31 Dec 1985 or earlier,
will retire the first day of the month following their original HYT date, or on 1 Jan 2012,
20                                                             AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


whichever comes first. SMSgts whose TAFMSD is 1 Jan 1986 or later will have HYT
established at the new HYT (26 years). Exceptions: Enlisted members who are approved for
HYT extension for hardship or best interest of the Air Force reason(s) may serve until
completion of their approved extension period. MSgt and TSgt who accept a Critical Skills
Retention Bonus may remain in service up to 25 years only.
     2.21.1. HYT Extensions. HYT extensions are rare and submissions should be made only
     when the member is experiencing an extreme hardship not common to contemporaries or in
     the best interest of the Air Force. The existing HYT policy was designed to manage the size
     of the career force and to induce a reasonable promotion flow to all grades. The HYT for
     SSgt through CMSgt was established to balance the need for experience and youth in the
     enlisted force.
     2.21.2. Extension of HYT Based on Hardship (See Attachment 1, Terms). Members may
     submit requests for extension of a HYT date based on extreme hardship not common to
     contemporaries. Approval requires detailed evidence that the member must stay on active
     duty to resolve the hardship and that the member can eliminate the problem within the
     extension period. The period requested should be the time needed to solve the problem, but
     may not exceed 1 year. The request must be routed through the member’s chain of command
     and the Wing or equivalent level commander must support the request. Any commander in
     the member’s chain may disapprove the request; in which case, the request will go no further.
     If approved at base level the HYT extension request should be forwarded to AFPC/DPSOR
     for action. The approval authority for the HYT extension requests is AFPC/DPSO (or
     AF/A1 for CMSgts). Note: Members who receive approval for an extension of their HYT
     based on hardship are ineligible for promotion consideration during the extension period.
     2.21.3. Extension of HYT Based on Best Interest of the Air Force (See Attachment 1,
     Terms). Members (or the members chain of command with the concurrence of the member)
     initiate and submit requests for HYT extensions based on the best interest of the Air Force.
     These requests should only be made when a uniquely qualified noncommissioned officer
     (NCO) is filling a critical position that is essential to the success of a vital mission and a
     suitable replacement cannot be found. The request must show that the member’s retention is
     essential to the success of the mission. The request must be routed through the member’s
     chain of command and the Wing or equivalent level commander must support the request.
     Any commander in the member’s chain may disapprove the request in which case the request
     will go no further. Requests will be accepted no earlier than 1 year and no later than 6
     months before the individuals established HYT. The maximum extension period is 1 year. If
     approved at base level the HYT extension request should be forwarded to AFPC/DPSOR for
     action. The approval authority for the HYT extension requests is AFPC/DPSO (or AF/A1
     for CMSgts).
     2.21.4. HYT Date of Demoted Members. Individuals demoted to a lower grade are subject to
     the HYT date of the lower grade (see paragraph 2.21). After a member is promoted to SSgt
     (E-5) their HYT is established at 20 years of service. If they are subsequently reduced in rank
     to E-4 or below and have 16 years TAFMS, they are considered to be length-of-service
     qualified so their HYT date will remain or be set at 20 years of service. Those demotees who
     have not yet reached the HYT for their lower grade will be allowed to remain on active duty
     until they reach the HYT for the lower grade. Those demotees who exceed the HYT for the
     new grade will be required to retire, if retirement eligible, on or earlier than the first day of
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                  21


   the seventh month following the effective date of demotion action (see AFI 36-2503,
   Administrative Demotion of Airmen). EXCEPTION: Individuals assigned overseas who are
   demoted and meet the above criteria will be required to serve until reaching their DEROS.
   2.21.5. Extensions to HYT dates due to temporary suspension to retirement processing.
   Members approaching their HYT dates who are placed on medical hold or whose retirement
   is temporarily suspended due to restriction identified in Table 2.2 may have their HYT dates
   adjusted in 3-month increments. MPFs will notify HQ AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts)
   to extend HYT dates based on above criteria. Upon verifying the temporary suspension to
   retirement, HQ AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE), will adjust the member’s HYT.
   2.21.6. Inquiries specifically pertaining to CMSgt HYTs and HYT extension requests should
   be referred to the Chief’s Group, (AF/DPE).
       2.21.6.1. Extension of HYT Based on Best Interest of the Air Force for CMSgts.
       Members (or the member’s chain of command with the concurrence of the member) may
       initiate and submit requests for HYT extensions based on the best interest of the Air
       Force if the member is serving in a critical Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) code. The
       Wing or comparable level commander must support the request and show that retention
       of the member is essential to the success of the mission. The maximum extension period
       is 1 year.
2.22. Request for Withdrawal or Change of Month. When a member gives a signed
retirement application to the MPF, the member cannot withdraw the application, nor can the
member change the approved retirement date except for the following reasons: severe hardship
not common to Air Force members; in the best interest of the Air Force; or to accept an active
duty promotion that requires the member to serve past the requested or approved retirement date.
To request withdrawal or change to the month of retirement, the member must submit written
justification. Table 3.2, rules 6 and 7; show how to submit these requests. Withdrawal or
extension usually will not be approved if the member is retiring under the 7-Day Option.
   2.22.1. Requests for Withdrawal or Extension of Retirement Date Based on Hardship. The
   request package must state what the hardship is and show, with written evidence, how
   retention on active duty will ease or solve the problem. Members must be able to explain
   how the hardship arose or worsened after applying for retirement; that they could not foresee
   the hardship when they made retirement plans. Unless the above reasons are adequately
   supported, members should not expect approval. The following conditions are considered
   common to many retiring members and, as such, are not usually acceptable as proof of severe
   hardship:
       2.22.1.1. Loss or delay of post-retirement employment or business opportunity.
       2.22.1.2. Loss or delay of plans for education or training.
       2.22.1.3. Retention to a date that would increase the rate of basic pay or the percentage
       multiplier.
       2.22.1.4. Failure to buy or sell property, or a delay in building a house.
       2.22.1.5. Illness of a dependent, unless treatment is not available through military
       facilities or local medical facilities.
       2.22.1.6. Employment of dependents.
22                                                            AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


        2.22.1.7. The MPF sends AF IMT 1160 with required documentation to HQ
        AFPC/DPPRR for lieutenant colonels and below. (EXCEPTION: Send documentation to
        AF/DPE for CMSgts, colonels and colonel selects for final approval/disapproval.)
     2.22.2. Requests for Withdrawal or Extension Based on Best Interest of the Air Force. The
     member initiates these requests. The commander or other senior official must provide
     evidence that clearly shows that it is in the best interest of the Air Force for the member to
     stay on active duty rather than retire on the scheduled date. For example, if the withdrawal or
     extension is based on unfavorable unit manning in the member’s Air Force Specialty Code
     (AFSC), then manning data, availability of a replacement and any other pertinent details
     must be included in the request. If the commander recommends disapproval, give reasons to
     support that recommendation.
     2.22.3. Request for Withdrawal or Extension Based on Promotion. These requests may be
     approved if the member was selected for promotion after applying for retirement. The
     member submits the withdrawal request within 10 workdays after notification of promotion
     selection. Enlisted personnel who applied for retirement under the assignment declination or
     7DO may not apply for withdrawal or extension based on promotion.
        2.22.3.1. For members selected for promotion to MSgt, SMSgt, or CMSgt: on the AF
        IMT 1160 remarks section, the MPF shows that the member has signed an agreement to
        fulfill the promotion ADSC. The MPF must forward the AF IMT 1160 to HQ
        AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts). The AF IMT 1160 must have the
        acknowledgement by the MPF that the member has signed the ADSC statement before it
        is filed in the member’s unit personnel records group (UPRG). The MPF updates MilPDS
        with SPEC-PROG-ID “71” and the date the member signed the request for retirement
        withdrawal.
        2.22.3.2. Members selected for promotion to SSgt or TSgt do not incur an ADSC for
        promotion. They may retire the 1st day of the month following the effective date of
        promotion or extend their retirement date for up to 6 months after the date of promotion.
        The MPF sends the AF IMT 1160 to HQ AFPC/DPPRR requesting withdrawal or
        extension of effective date or retirement based on promotion.
     2.22.4. Request for Withdrawal or Extension for Medical Reasons. A member may not
     request withdrawal or extension to stay on active duty solely to resolve a medical problem or
     receive medical treatment. If the member’s medical problems are severe enough to warrant a
     change of retirement date, the local medical facility uses the medical hold procedures
     detailed in Chapter 5.
2.23. Request for Extension Beyond a Date of Separation (DOS). The MPF will not accept
or process a request to extend a retirement past the DOS of an enlisted member, or the mandatory
DOS of an officer. EXCEPTION: The SAF or designee may delay an officer’s retirement to
complete actions with a view to trial by court-martial or to complete a medical evaluation (see
paragraph 4.2.2).
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    23

    investigation                      application to the member until investigation is complete. If an
                                       application has already been submitted, MPF suspends processing
                                       of application until investigation is complete. If one or more of
                                       the restrictions in Table 2.2. apply, process accordingly. When
                                       no further action is taken after investigation is completed, return
                                       to NORMAL application processing (see note 1).

lieutenant colonels and below (for CMSgts, notify AF/DPE; for colonels and colonel selects
notify AF/DPO) so that retirement processing is suspended or the approved retirement is
cancelled. However, Regular officers and certain Reserve officers projected to retire on their
mandatory retirement date (see Table 4.1) may have their retirement suspended only in
accordance with procedures shown in 10 USC §639 (disciplinary action), 10 USC §640 (medical
reasons), or 10 USC §123 or §12305 (STOP LOSS).
2. Processing of an OGD will not suspend the mandatory retirement date of a Regular officer or
of certain Reserve officers.

3. Pertains to members who apply for retirement before ASD. If the application was submitted
on or after ASD, member may apply, if eligible, under assignment declination or 7DO rules (see
paragraph 2.19). AFI 36-2110, paragraphs 1.5, 2.37. and 3.8. provide guidance on requesting
extensions and curtailments of stabilized tours and DEROS, respectively.

                                           the MAJCOM for SAF decision.
                                           When requested retirement date is
                                           earlier than punishment completion
                                           date, the retirement date may be
                                           delayed. An approved retirement
                                           does not preclude completion of a
                                           sentence to confinement. The record
                                           of trial is sent in normal course and
                                           will be made available at
                                           AFLSA/JAJ as necessary (see note

                                           notes 10, 14 and 19).

   (UCMJ)                                  When a member requests a
                                           retirement date earlier than
                                           punishment completion date, the
                                           MPF must inform the commander
                                           that, if the commander signs the
                                           application and does not recommend
                                           retirement at a later date to coincide
                                           with completion of punishment, the
                                           earlier retirement date will probably
                                           be approved and, if so, remaining
                                           punishment will be remitted. The

                                           who imposed punishment must
                                           indicate that punishment was or will
                                           be remitted by the requested date
                                           (see notes 10, 14 and 18).

1. If submitted under hardship provisions, enter special program identifier "70." If in the best
interest of the Air Force, enter "73."
2. A member who cannot serve as specified by reason of DOS must request a retirement date
effective the 1st day of DOS month. Officers who are changing occupational specialty or skill
designator as a result of reclassification or retraining incur a 12-month ADSC. Airmen who
retrain in conjunction with a CONUS-to-CONUS PCS move incur a 12-month ADSC.
3. Member must submit a request for waiver of the promotion ADSC for either best interest of
the Air Force or hardship, with justification.
4. Reserve officers who are notified they will be released from active duty without their consent
and who then apply for retirement and are retired under 10 USC §8911, are considered to have
retired involuntarily. Thus, their retired grade is set according to 10 USC §1370(a)(1).
5. Officers in grades above major wishing to voluntarily retire in their officer grade must serve
three years in grade or retire in the next lower grade as directed by 10 USC §1370. Officers who
cannot justify waiver of the time-in-grade (TIG) requirement, or whose waiver request is
disapproved, may ask to retire in the next lower grade held satisfactorily for at least 6 months on
active duty. Officers who wish to retire in the next lower grade must indicate the specific grade
(Major, Lt Colonel, etc.) in which the officer is asking to retire and must sign under this
statement in the “remarks section” of the AF IMT 1160. Include documentation to substantiate
waiver of any ADSC.
6. Members whose overseas tours are extended or curtailed will have their ADSC date adjusted
to equal their DEROS.
7. Officers assigned to a Critical Acquisition Position (CAP) require a waiver for service
obligation (10 USC §1734). Only SAF/AQ or the designated representative at the MAJCOM has
approval authority to waive a CAP ADSC. The waiver criteria are not included in Table 2.2 To
request a waiver, the officer completes a DD Form 2588, Acquisition Corps - Waiver Request,
Department of Defense, obtains the supervisor’s or commander’s signature, then submits it to
SAF/AQ or the MAJCOM designated representative for processing. Once the officer’s waiver
request is approved by SAF/AQ or the MAJCOM designated representative, the officer may
submit a retirement application (AF IMT 1160).
8. See the applicable AFI for retirement eligibility criteria, allowable retirement date, and
specific processing procedures.
9. When members have an ETS prior to the date they become retirement-eligible, and retirement
in lieu of discharge is approved by the SAF, the Secretary may direct extension of enlistment to
allow the member to retire on the 1st day of the month after the month in which 20 years TAFMS
is completed.
10. If a member has applied for retirement and the MPF later finds that a restriction applies, the
MPF immediately notifies HQ AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts or AF/DPO for colonels and
colonel selectees) and the MAJCOM to suspend retirement processing. If a member has an
approved retirement and, prior to the effective date of retirement, the MPF later finds that a
restriction applies, the MPF immediately notifies HQ AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts or
AF/DPO for colonels and colonel selectees) and the MAJCOM for processing instructions. In
these instances, the MPF suspends retirement actions. In either case, the instructions under the
applicable rule in this table then apply.
11. In the absence of a request for waiver, a restriction ends upon termination of administrative
action not resulting in discharge.

12. Officers with 20 years TAFMS who have completed less than 10 years Total Active Federal
Commissioned Service (TAFCS) may apply for separation for the purpose of enlisting and
retiring in an enlisted grade (see paragraph 3.7).
13. Members applying for retirement in lieu of demotion (AFI 36-2503 action) will either be
approved for retirement in grade or disapproved for retirement in lieu of demotion (at which
time, demotion action may take place).
14. MPF ensures that officer grade determination action is completed and forwarded with the
case (see Table 3.2, note 2).
15. In the absence of a request for waiver, restriction terminates upon recoupment, payment, or
forgiveness.
16. In the absence of a request for waiver, a restriction terminates upon expiration or vacation of
the period of suspension.
17. Between opening of a court-martial and sentencing, applications usually are not acted upon.
When sentence is set aside and a rehearing is authorized, case reverts to rule 15 until the
rehearing starts.
18. In the absence of a request for waiver, a restriction terminates upon punishment completion
date.
19. In the absence of a request for waiver, a restriction terminates upon decision to not initiate
administrative discharge action.

                                            Chapter 3

          VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT IN OFFICER OR ENLISTED STATUS

3.1. Voluntary Authority. Table 3.1 shows the section of law, as well as the conditions of
eligibility and approval, relating to application for voluntary retirement. To be eligible for
voluntary retirement, a member must have completed at least 20 years of active military service.
To retire in an officer grade, at least 10 of the minimum 20 years of active service must be active
commissioned service. Unless a member receives a waiver (paragraph 2.18) or is entitled to
retire in a higher grade (paragraphs 7.2 and 7.3), the member must meet the applicable TIG
requirements shown in Table 2.2 and Chapter 7.
3.2. General Procedures. When to submit application. Subject to prohibitions in Table 2.1 and
restrictions in Table 2.2, eligible members may apply for retirement no earlier than 1 year before
the desired retirement date, but no later than 120 days which should include the desired amount
of terminal leave and PTDY. EXCEPTION: When the application is submitted under the
assignment declination or 7DO program, see paragraph 2.19 Enlisted members must ask for a
retirement date that falls within their current enlistment or extension of enlistment.
   3.2.1. The SAF may prescribe, for specific categories of members, either a longer or shorter
   application period.
   3.2.2. The effective date of all non-disability service retirements is set by 5 USC §8301 as
   the first day of the month after the month in which retirement otherwise would be effective.
   3.2.3. The MPF takes the steps in Table 3.2 when processing retirement applications. Check
   Table 3.1 to see if the applicant meets minimum eligibility requirements or is limited by
   prohibitions or restrictions in Table 2.1 or Table 2.2 The MPF explains the effect retirement
   restrictions have on the member. If the member wants a waiver to those restrictions, the MPF
   should explain waiver procedures. When the member has no condition that prohibits
   submission of application or restriction, give the applicant a copy of the Pre-application
   Checklist (Attachment 7) before accepting the application (AF IMT 1160). Answer any
   questions and have member sign the checklist to show they understand the information
   provided. Put a signed copy of the Pre-application Checklist in Section 3 of the UPRG. The
   MPF ensures the member’s commander answers the statements on all officer retirement
   applications (AF IMT 1160) as provided in paragraph 7.5.4
       3.2.3.1. Upon return of the application for retirement (AF IMT 1160), the MPF reviews
       the commander’s statements.
       3.2.3.2. If answers to all questions are negative and the commander has signed the AF
       IMT 1160, the MPF continues normal processing.
       3.2.3.3. If the commander answers any questions affirmatively, an OGD must be
       initiated, or the wing commander/senior rater is required to make a signed statement to
       explain the basis for not initiating an OGD. The MPF processes the application for
       retirement (AF IMT 1160) and attaches pertinent documents to the application (see
       paragraph 7.5).
32                                                            AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


     3.2.4. By email message (during MINIMIZE, by mail), the MPF notifies AF/DPO when any
     colonel or colonel selectee applies for retirement and sends an information copy of the
     message to the MAJCOM/DP and to the intermediate level headquarters DP. Include the date
     of the application, requested date of retirement, the member’s duty AFSC (DAFSC), and the
     date on which terminal leave or PTDY (or both) will begin, if applicable.
     3.2.5. A member who has applied for voluntary retirement remains liable for assignment or
     training within the limits of the retirement date. These members may not incur a voluntary
     service commitment that goes past the retirement date without withdrawing the application or
     getting an approved change in the retirement month. These members may become ineligible
     for promotion and may become ineligible to reenlist
     3.2.6. The MPF makes certain that the AF IMT 1160 is accurate and complete according to
     instructions on the reverse side of the form and that justification of any waiver request meets
     the requirement of Chapter 2, Section 2C.
     3.2.7. In cases involving more than one waiver or one special program, the MPF annotates
     all MilPDS transaction waiver codes and special program ID codes in the remarks section
     (EXAMPLE: "WR30," "SP70.” See Attachment 6 for complete listing of codes). If any
     retirement action involves a request for waiver of a restriction, withdrawal of an application,
     or change of retirement month, enter the proper code in the MilPDS transaction. The
     approval authority (AFPC/DPPRR, AF/DPO or AF/DPE) does not confirm MilPDS
     transactions until the AF IMT 1160 is received by mail or fax.
     3.2.8. The MPF chief may designate any member in the MPF in a grade no lower than TSgt
     or GS-6 as an authorized person to sign AF IMT 1160, section III.
     3.2.9. HQ AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts or AF/DPO for colonels and colonel
     selectees) notifies the MPF of the approval or disapproval decision via MilPDS entry, by
     correspondence, or by issuing retirement orders.
     3.2.10. An officer who has an approved voluntary retirement should expect to retire on their
     approved date. If the officer is non-selected for promotion for a second time during the time
     between the date their retirement is approved and date of retirement, the officer will be
     retired not later than the MSD prescribed by law, even if this mandatory retirement date is
     earlier than the previously approved voluntary retirement date unless selected for
     continuation (see Chapter 4 for further discussion concerning mandatory retirement dates).
3.3. Application by Members Assigned to Geographically Separated Units (GSU). For
members assigned to a GSU, the commander’s support staff assists members in completing the
AF IMT 1160, section I. Follow instructions in Table 3.2 Arrange for a medical examination if
elected or required. The commander’s support staff gets the commander’s signature on the AF
IMT 1160, then sends the application, with an additional copy, to the member’s servicing MPF.
     3.3.1. If a restriction in Table 2.2 applies, the GSU sends a request for waiver or other
     documents with the application.
        3.3.1.1. If the member’s commander is at the GSU's location, the commander’s
        recommendation is also sent with the AF IMT 1160.
        3.3.1.2. If the member’s commander is not at the same location, the servicing MPF
        obtains the commander’s recommendation prior to transmitting the AF IMT 1160.
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                   33


   3.3.2. If there is no restriction to retirement, continue application processing as shown in
   Table 3.2
   3.3.3. When the servicing MPF receives the AF IMT 1160 from the unit, process it as shown
   in Table 3.2
3.4. Application by General Officers. A general officer applies for retirement by sending a
personal, handwritten letter to the Air Force Chief of Staff at least 4 months before the desired
effective date.
   3.4.1. Unless granted a waiver under some provision of law, general officers must have
   served on active duty in the grade from which they are retiring for not less than 3 years.
       3.4.1.1. In the case of voluntary retirements for brigadier and major generals, the Under
       Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness has authority to approve time-in-grade
       waivers.
       3.4.1.2. The authority granted to the Under Secretary is also granted to the Principal
       Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. This authority may not
       be further delegated.
       3.4.1.3. Officers who do not meet the time-in-grade requirement retire in the next lower
       grade held on active duty satisfactorily for at least 6 months, as determined by the SAF.
       3.4.1.4. In the case of voluntary retirements for Lieutenant Generals or Generals, the
       Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and readiness is authorized to approve
       voluntary retirements in grade except if a time-in-grade waiver is required. The Secretary
       of Defense has the authority to approve time-in-grade waivers.
3.5. Application by Members of Reserve Components Not on Extended Active Duty. The
MAJCOM for Air National Guard (ANG) members is the National Guard Bureau, Director of
Personnel, (NGB/DP). For Air Force Reserve members, it is Headquarters Air Reserve Personnel
Center (ARPC).
   3.5.1. Authorities for Retirement:
       3.5.1.1. ANG and Air Force Reserve enlisted members who accrue at least 20 years of
       active military service may retire under 10 USC §8914.
       3.5.1.2. ANG and Air Force Reserve officers must have at least 20 years of active
       military service and also have 10 years active commissioned service. They retire under 10
       USC §8911.
       3.5.1.3. 10 USC §12731 and Chapter 9 address Air Reserve Component members
       entitled to retired pay benefits at age 60.
   3.5.2. Air Reserve Component (ARC) members apply for retirement under 10 USC §8911 or
   §8914 using the AF IMT 1160. The member obtains the form from the servicing MPF or HQ
   ARPC/DPPR, 6760 E Irvington Place #1900, Denver CO, 80280-1900. ARC members who
   apply for retirement under 10 USC §8911 or §8914 must meet the criteria and comply with
   this instruction. For example, in Table 2.2, rules 2, 3, 4, and 10 through 18 apply to these
   members; the remaining rules in that table do not apply due to the nature of the Reserve
   assignment system.
34                                                              AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


     3.5.3. Send the AF IMT 1160 at least 60 days before, but no earlier than 120 days before, the
     desired retirement date, taking into consideration any planned PTDY and terminal leave. Fill
     in items 1 through 6 and 10, showing the member’s home address in item 6 rather than the
     unit of assignment.
     3.5.4. Submitting Applications.
        3.5.4.1. Applications from non-EAD Reserve component members are sent to HQ
        ARPC/DPPR, 6760 E Irvington Place, #1900, Denver CO 80280-1900.
        3.5.4.2. Applications from ANG component members are sent to HQ ARPC/DPPR with
        a copy to The Adjutant General of their state.
     3.5.5. Reserve component members do not need a medical examination.
     3.5.6. After receiving the AF IMT 1160, HQ ARPC will:
        3.5.6.1. Establish a case file; prepare an audit to verify service.
        3.5.6.2. Forward pay application forms to the member; upon receipt of completed pay
        documents, publish retirement orders.
        3.5.6.3. Update the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) and DFAS-CL pay file.
        3.5.6.4. Forward retirement orders and other appropriate documents to member and
        DFAS-CL.
3.6. Retired Recall, Release from Active Duty to Revert to Retired List. A member who is
called back to active duty from retired status for a specific period is released on the last day of
that active duty period and reverts back to retired status on the next day. The member’s original
retirement date will never change; rather, the member will now also have a “revert to retired
status” effective date.
     3.6.1. HQ AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts or AF/DPO for colonels and colonel
     selectees) sends a notice to the MPF 8 months before the scheduled date of release, when
     length of recall period permits, to give instructions on release actions.
        3.6.1.1. The MPF notifies HQ AFPC/DPPAO (LtCol and below) or HQ AFPC/DPPAE
        (SMSgt and below) for instructions on requesting changes to DOS. Contact AF/DPE for
        CMSgts or AF/ DPO for colonels and colonel selectees. HQ AFPC/DPPRR will receive
        notification from HQ AFPC/DPPAO/DPPAE of changes to DOS.
3.7. Officers Desiring Retirement in Enlisted Status. Only under hardship situations or an
established mandatory DOS as determined by the SAF or designee, officers with 20 years
TAFMS who wish to retire before completing 10 years of active commissioned service must first
request and be approved for resignation or release from active duty according to AFI 36-3207,
Separating Commissioned Officers. They must also be accepted for, and enlisted in, the Regular
Air Force for the purpose of retirement.
     3.7.1. For regular or reserve commissioned officers to be eligible for retirement under 10
     USC §8911, they must not only have 20 years of active service but also a minimum of 10
     years of active commissioned service to retire as an officer. Without meeting both of these
     requirements, they are ineligible for retirement as an officer regardless of TAFMS. 10 USC
     §8914, that allows for enlisted members to retire, specifically requires an eligible member to
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                       35


  be an enlisted member. Because there are no actual provisions of law that would allow an
  officer to retire as an enlisted member, the following procedure has been developed. This
  strict procedure involves a number of AFPC offices to effect a retirement of an officer in
  enlisted status. To participate, an officer on active duty must:
     3.7.1.1. Apply for separation; then
     3.7.1.2. Apply for active-duty enlistment and accession; and then
     3.7.1.3. Apply for retirement in that active-duty enlisted status. To effect an enlisted
     retirement, officers will not fill enlisted accession billets; rather, they will only hold their
     enlisted status for one day, then retire the next. Officers desiring to retire as enlisted
     members are required to be in enlisted status upon retirement to meet the requirements of
     10 USC §8914 as stated above, but they may not fill a slot or remain on active duty in
     this status for any longer than required. An officer may not apply for retirement in
     enlisted status but must first attain enlisted status on active duty prior to
     completing/submitting a retirement application in their new enlisted grade. To
     accomplish this type of retirement, the officer will not be able to have PTDY or take
     terminal leave in enlisted status in conjunction with retirement. Approval of the
     retirement request and inability to use either permissive TDY or terminal leave may not
     be construed as a denial of entitlement(s).
         3.7.1.3.1. The MPF should inform the member that there is ALWAYS a delay in
         initial retirement pay when a member changes from officer to enlisted status because
         data does not flow quickly.
         3.7.1.3.2. In all instances, the MPF should have the member sign a statement of
         understanding as follows: “I understand and acknowledge that, by resigning my
         commission and enlisting for the purpose of immediate retirement, my active duty
         and/or retired pay may be delayed. By changing my status while still on active duty
         from officer to enlisted and immediately retiring in enlisted status, the necessary data
         to all involved agencies may take longer to initiate a change in my active duty pay as
         well as my retirement pay.”
  3.7.2. It is mandatory for the officer to return to the assigned unit for final separation,
  enlistment, and retirement processing. If the officer desires to take PTDY and “ordinary
  leave” in their officer status, they must ensure they have enough time prior to returning to
  their unit for final outprocessing. Officers must specifically request, as an exception to
  policy, PTDY in their officer status (under AFI 36-3003, paragraph 12.2.) because members
  are not entitled to PTDY in conjunction with voluntary separation and, prior to the member’s
  enlistment, the retirement may not be approved.
  3.7.3. The officer sends the resignation or request for release (AF IMT 780, Officer
  Separation Actions) to the Separations Branch (HQ AFPC/DPPRS) to be effective 3
  calendar days before desired retirement date. The following day, the member enlists on
  active duty; the last day of the month, member would separate; followed by immediate
  retirement the next day (first of the month).
     3.7.3.1. An officer who separates and enlists for the purpose of retirement in enlisted
     status is not entitled to HHG shipment and travel of authorized family members based on
     separation orders.
36                                                            AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


        3.7.3.2. The MPF attaches the AF IMT 780 to a signed AF IMT 1160 with these entries
        left blank: grade (item 3), effective date of retirement (item 10), and dates under items 12
        and 14. The MPF also submits a separate letter requesting grade determination for
        enlistment. The AF IMT 780 and 1160 with letter requesting grade determination are sent
        to the Separations Branch (HQ AFPC/ DPPRS) for processing.
     3.7.4. After the approval of the officer’s resignation or release, DPPRS sends the request for
     grade determination to the Skills Management Branch (HQ AFPC/DPPAE) and the AF IMT
     1160 to the Retirements Branch (HQ AFPC/DPPRR).
     3.7.5. HQ AFPC/DPPAE makes a determination as to enlisted grade and sends enlistment
     authorization to the servicing MPF with information copy to HQ AFPC/DPPRR.
     3.7.6. When the member enlists in the Regular Air Force for the purpose of retiring, HQ
     AFPC/ DPPRR fills in the authorized enlisted grade in item 3 and the dates in items 10, 12,
     and 14 of the AF IMT 1160. Only then does the completed AF IMT 1160 become a valid
     application for retirement. At that time, HQ AFPC/DPPRR publishes retirement orders and
     provides the MPF with either the retirement order or the special order number and fund
     citation (notification can be by telephone, message, email or fax).
     3.7.7. The MPF must tell the officers they will not be able to take terminal leave, but may, as
     an exception to policy, request PTDY and ordinary leave in their officer status. If approved,
     they may take the PTDY and ordinary leave 20 or 30 days prior to their separation as an
     officer. Members must have retirement orders in hand before they can out-process and retire.
     Because orders under subparagraph 3.7.6 are not published before the date of enlistment, it is
     imperative that officers return to their unit following PTDY and ordinary leave for final out-
     processing.
     3.7.8. When that member’s active duty plus service on the retired list totals 30 years, the
     member will be advanced to the highest grade held satisfactorily on active duty as
     determined by the SAF.
3.8. Retired Pay Increase Due to Extraordinary Heroism (Enlisted Only). Deeds of
extraordinary heroism may entitle an enlisted member to receive 10 percent additional retired
pay if member retires under 10 USC §8914. (10 USC §8991)
     3.8.1. Since extraordinary heroism is the criterion for award of the Medal of Honor (MH),
     Air Force Cross (AFC), or equivalent Army or Navy decorations, these awards provide
     automatic entitlement to the additional 10 percent retirement pay (not to exceed 75 percent)
     for enlisted members. If heroism is involved in the award of any other medal to an enlisted
     member, SAF will determine, coincident to awarding the medal, whether or not the
     additional 10 percent retirement pay will be authorized.
        3.8.1.1. Because the law is not restrictive with regard to the types of decorations that
        may qualify an individual for this increase in retired pay, the SAF has the authority to
        evaluate the heroic actions that have earned the Silver Star, Distinguished Flying Cross
        (DFC)(noncombat), and the Airman’s Medal to determine if extraordinary heroism was
        involved which would entitle the recipient to the increase in retired pay.
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                   37


     3.8.1.2. The Secretary recognizes there could be broad variances in individual opinions
     as to what constitutes “extraordinary heroism” and relies on the recommendations of the
     SAF Personnel Council (SAFPC) in this regard.
     3.8.1.3. SAFPC is composed of senior officers having broad staff and command
     experience who are well-qualified to evaluate these cases by comparing the heroism
     involved for award of the MH and AFC.
  3.8.2. An enlisted member who receives the MH, the AFC, or an equal Army or Navy
  decoration, automatically receives the additional 10 percent in retired pay. The MPF will
  follow procedures in paragraph 3.8.5
  3.8.3. Since 1979, enlisted members who have been awarded the Silver Star, the DFC for
  heroism in a noncombat action, or the Airman's Medal have been automatically considered
  for the additional 10 percent retired pay increase. If they were approved for the additional 10
  percent increase in retirement pay, their special order approving the decoration will include a
  statement to that fact. Absence of a statement on the special order authorizing the additional
  10 percent of retirement pay may indicate that it was not approved by the SAFPC. If the
  member believes consideration was not made at the time the medal was awarded, the
  member may ask for a Secretarial decision.
  3.8.4. Even though the enlisted member qualifies for the 10 percent increase, the total
  amount of retired pay cannot be more than 75 percent of the member's active duty basic pay
  at the time of retirement. The 10 percent is not added to the basic pay multiplier; it is an
  additional 10 percent of the already-calculated retired pay.
  3.8.5. If an enlisted member claims extraordinary heroism based on award of a decoration
  mentioned in paragraph 3.8.3 above, the MPF screens the member’s records to see if it
  includes a Secretarial decision at the time the decoration was awarded. These Secretarial
  decisions are most commonly found in the member’s records as a successive order to the
  order granting the award itself.
     3.8.5.1. If the record established extraordinary heroism and the member qualifies for the
     10 percent increase, fill in AF IMT 1160, section I, and check the appropriate block in
     item 8. Attach the order or letter authorizing the additional retired pay.
     3.8.5.2. If the records show no prior review, fill in AF IMT 1160, Section I, and check
     the appropriate block in item 8. Attach a copy of order awarding the decoration and the
     official citation. If the award documents are not in the records, ask the member for the
     citation or a statement describing the act of heroism, a narrative recommendation for
     award of the decoration, and any other related documents or facts the enlisted member
     may possess that could aid the Secretary in making a decision.
     3.8.5.3. Mail the AF IMT 1160 with appropriate documents to HQ AFPC/DPPRR
     (AF/DPE for CMSgts).
     3.8.5.4. The Secretary’s determination as to extraordinary heroism is conclusive for all
     purposes.

3.9. Immediate Retirement of Members Removed From the Temporary Disability Retired
List (TDRL). If the Air Force determines that a member is fit for duty and removes the
member’s name from the TDRL, and the member is eligible to retire for years of service or age,
the member may ask to be retired upon removal from the TDRL. (see AFI 36-3212).
     3.9.1. The USAF Physical Disability Division (HQ AFPC/DPPD) notifies               the TDRL
     member when the Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) finds the member fit for           duty. They
     provide a fact sheet to the member that shows the member’s options. If the         member is
     eligible for an active duty retirement and desires to retire upon the finding of   fitness, the
     member notifies HQ AFPC/DPPD of this decision.
     3.9.2. If the TDRL member does not concur with the finding of fitness, HQ AFPC/DPPD
     submits the case for Secretarial determination. If the SAF determines that the member is fit
     for duty, HQ AFPC/ DPPD informs the member of the decision.
     3.9.3. Upon notification of the fitness determination, if eligible, a member can initiate a
     request for retirement by completing an AF IMT 1160. The application for retirement is
     returned to HQ AFPC/ DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts or AF/DPO for colonels and colonel
     selectees) for completion of processing.
     3.9.4. HQ AFPC/DPPD advises HQ AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts or AF/DPO for
     colonels and colonel selectees) to issue orders effecting member’s removal from the TDRL
     the last day of the month and service retirement on the 1st day of the following month. HQ
     AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts or AF/DPO for colonels and colonel selectees)
     provides a copy of retirement order to HQ AFPC/DPPD who sends it to member.
3.10. Suspension or Curtailment of Voluntary Retirement Due to National Emergency
(Stop Loss). The President may suspend voluntary retirements under conditions prescribed in 10
USC §123 and §12305.
     3.10.1. When notified by the Officer Policy Division and the Enlisted Policy Division (HQ
     USAF/ A1P) to suspend active duty losses, HQ AFPC/DPPR announces suspension of
     retirements by AIG message (includes MINIMIZE).
     3.10.2. The Directorate of Personnel Force Management Division (HQ USAF/A1P)
     determines if the suspension will be either across the board or selective.

1. MPF advises member that the AF IMT 1160 must be returned within 7 workdays after the
member signs the application. If the AF IMT 1160 is not returned in 7 workdays, the MPF can
assume the member has decided not to request a retirement date.
2. If the MPF receives a retirement application that raises doubt the officer served satisfactorily
in the higher grade, the MPF will notify the member’s commander. The commander then informs
the member that SAF or designee will make an officer grade determination (paragraph 7.5). The
MPF follows the procedures in paragraph 7.5, forwarding the OGD package to the MAJCOM,
with an information copy of the transmittal sheet to HQ AFPC/DPPRR (or to AF/DPO for
colonels and colonel selects).
3. Within 5 workdays after updating MilPDS, the MPF mails the following documents to HQ
AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts) along with the AF IMT 1160: copies of the order that
promoted the member to the highest grade held, the order or other documents effecting
demotion, a records review RIP, all of the member’s enlisted performance reports (APRs or
EPRs. When member has an Unfavorable Information File (UIF), it is critical that a copy of the
entire UIF, including AF IMT 1137, Unfavorable Information File Summary, be forwarded
along with request for a grade determination.
4. Applications will be disapproved or returned without action to the MPF if there is no
supporting documentation to justify the waiver request. The commander’s signature does not, by
itself, constitute justification. If the application is returned because it did not contain sufficient
justification for the waiver, the member may resubmit a new, fully-justified request to the
appropriate headquarters.

                                             Chapter 4

                                 MANDATORY RETIREMENT

4.1. Applicability. This chapter applies to Regular and Reserve officers. There are similarities
in special provisions and restrictions that apply to these two component categories.
4.2. Mandatory Separation Date (MSD) for Retirement.
     4.2.1. Table 4. 1. lists the date set by law and the conditions for retiring regular and reserve
     officers by reason of years of service, age, promotion deferral, board, or other actions
     approved by the SAF.
     4.2.2. The SAF or designee may delay an officer’s retirement as necessary to allow
     completion of disciplinary action or medical evaluation (10 USC §639 & §640).
        4.2.2.1. To delay an MSD, the MPF sends a request to HQ AFPC/DPPRR (or to
        AF/DPO for colonels and colonel selectees).
        4.2.2.2. The appropriate Headquarters (HQ) then forwards the request for Secretarial
        determination.
        4.2.2.3. If the SAF or designee approves the delay, the appropriate HQ rescinds the
        officer’s retirement order and extends the MSD from month to month until completion of
        the action.
     4.2.3. When the officer is notified that court-martial charges are being initiated and the
     notice is within 60 days of the MSD, the MPF requests that HQ AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPO for
     colonels and colonel selects) delay the retirement to complete disciplinary action. If a
     decision is subsequently made to not pursue court-martial charges and the member is
     permitted to retire, but the original retirement date has passed, member must retire on the 1 st
     day of the month following the month the decision is made not to pursue court-martial
     charges.
     4.2.4. If medical evaluation, observation, or treatment to determine entitlement to disability
     retirement cannot be completed by the MSD, the MPF sends a request for medical hold. If
     the officer is within 60 days of the MSD, when placed on medical hold by HQ
     AFPC/DPAMM, procedures in paragraph 5.7, apply.
4.3. Service for Mandatory Retirement. MSDs for Regular and Reserve officers are
established by law (Table 4.1). EXCEPTION: For mandatory retirement of officers on active
duty on 14 September 1981, add any creditable service under the laws in effect on that date to all
active commissioned service performed after that date, and use to compute service under the
laws in effect on 15 September 1981.
4.4. Uniform Retirement Date. 5 USC §8301 sets the effective date of all service retirements
as the 1st day of the month after the month in which retirement otherwise would be effective.
4.5. Notification of Mandatory Retirement. About 12 months before the officer’s MSD, HQ
AFPC/ DPPRR (or AF/DPO for colonels) will notify the MPF to start retirement processing.
     4.5.1. Upon receipt of this notification, the MPF notifies the officer’s commander of the
     retirement effective date and the exact reason for mandatory retirement (length of service or
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                      45


   age). The notification states that, unless the member requests a voluntary retirement on or
   earlier than the MSD, the appropriate HQ will publish retirement orders no later than 90 days
   before the effective MSD.
   4.5.2. By personal letter, the commander informs the officer of the MSD including other
   information provided by the MPF. The support group commander or other appropriate senior
   officer will notify colonels of their MSD in writing. For the purpose of this written
   notification, “commander” is usually the senior officer present in the member’s unit of
   assignment, or another senior officer in the member’s rating chain of command or command
   channel.
   4.5.3. The Officer Promotion Branch (HQ AFPC/DPPPOO) furnishes the MPF a list of
   officers who have been twice-considered, but not selected, for promotion to major and
   lieutenant colonel. The MPF notifies these officers of their non-selection and forthcoming
   retirement.
       4.5.3.1. In the same notice, the MPF tells officers their MSD will be shown within 90
       days in MilPDS as a DOS change. This mandatory retirement date takes precedence over
       any prior voluntary retirement date approved for later than the required MSD.
4.6. Actions Following Notification. Officers who are notified of non-selection for promotion
indicate whether they plan to retire on the MSD or voluntarily retire on the same or earlier date
(by checking the proper block in Section I of the AF IMT 1160) and give the form to the MPF
for processing.
   4.6.1. Actions by the MPF:
       4.6.1.1. If the officer chooses to retire on the MSD, the MPF updates MilPDS with
       SPEC-PROG-ID code 91, indicating that the member elects to retire on established MSD.
       4.6.1.2. If the officer chooses voluntary retirement and the date requested is earlier than
       the MSD (paragraph 4.7), the MPF updates MilPDS with SPEC-PROG-ID code 93,
       which indicates member elects to retire one or more months before established mandatory
       retirement date.
       4.6.1.3. AF IMT 1160 is the source document for updating MilPDS. After updating
       MilPDS, file the original of AF Form 1160 is filed in the UPRG as a permanent
       document.
       4.6.1.4. If an officer chooses voluntary retirement effective 1 or more months before the
       mandatory retirement date, the MPF checks Table 2.2 to ensure there is no restriction on
       the earlier date. However, the time-in-grade requirements must be met to ensure
       retirement in officer’s current active duty grade if retiring in voluntary status (10 USC
       §1370, as shown in Table 2.2 and Chapter 7).
       4.6.1.5. If a prohibition (Table 2.1, rule 1) or restriction (Table 2.2, rules 12 through 19)
       applies, the MPF files original in the UPRG and sends copy of AF IMT 1160 to HQ
       AFPC/DPPRR (AF/ DPO for colonels or colonel selects) through the MAJCOM.
   4.6.2. Normally, the designated SAF official may waive a restriction to retirement if the date
   is within 6 months before the MSD. Table 2.2, column C, lists the applicable waiver codes.
       4.6.2.1. The MPF updates MilPDS with the appropriate waiver code.
46                                                            AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


     4.6.3. The MPF follows the procedures for scheduling a retirement physical examination in
     Chapter 5 and AFI 36-2102 and AFI 48-123, Medical Examination and Medical Standards.
4.7. Voluntary Retirement on the Mandatory Retirement Date. Officers (except as shown in
paragraph 4.7.3) may apply for their voluntary retirement to be the same as their MSD, if they
are eligible to voluntarily retire under any other provision of law.
     4.7.1. The officer checks the “Application for Voluntary Retirement” block in Section I of
     the AF IMT 1160.
     4.7.2. The MPF updates MilPDS with SPEC-PROG-ID code “91.”
     4.7.3. EXCEPTION: Regular colonels who have the statutory right to complete the years
     of service allowed under a prior law, whose mandatory retirement date is based on 10 USC
     §8921, as in effect on 14 September 1981, may apply for an earlier, voluntary retirement
     date. However, the requested voluntary date must be 1 or more months earlier than the
     mandatory date (see paragraph 4.4). (This provision only applies to officers who were
     selected for the grade of Colonel prior to 14 September 1981.)
        4.7.3.1. Use the rates of basic pay in effect on the officer’s mandatory cut-off date (that
        is, the date the officer completes the maximum service for mandatory retirement) in
        computing the retired pay.
4.8. Tenure and Retirement of Permanent Academy Professors. The SAF, or designee, may
retire permanent professors having more than 30 years of service as a commissioned officer or
keep them to age 64 (10 USC §8920 & §1251).
     4.8.1. Compute the professor's service as a commissioned officer by adding the years of
     service as a professor to any other active federal commissioned service.
     4.8.2. Satisfactory performance as a permanent professor, in most cases, justifies retention to
     age 64.
     4.8.3. The Secretary may make exceptions to this policy.
     4.8.4. A permanent professor whose grade on retirement is below brigadier general, and who
     has long and distinguished service as a permanent professor may, at the discretion of the
     President, be retired in the grade of brigadier general (see paragraph 7.3). The Superintendent
     of the United States Air Force Academy may recommend that a professor be retired in that
     higher grade. The recommendation is addressed to AF/DPO or HQ AFPC/DPPRR if the
     professor is a lieutenant colonel in which case a copy is sent to AF/DPO.
4.9. Recall or Retention of Regular and Reserve Officers Beyond Mandatory Retirement
Date.
     4.9.1. Any retired officer of the Regular or Reserve Air Force may be ordered to active duty
     after mandatory retirement by recall under 10 USC §688, §12301 or §12307. However,
     officers retired by selective early retirement board (SERB) action and officers who, after
     having been notified that they were to be considered for early retirement under 10 USC §638
     and requested retirement before being considered by that board, are not recalled to active
     duty unless during a time of war or national emergency declared by Congress or the
     President. Send requests for recall with self-supporting justification to the Skills Management
     Branch (HQ AFPC/DPPAE).
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                      47


   4.9.2. Only the mandatory retirement of Regular officers who, on or after 15 September
   1981, are serving in or selected for promotion to the Regular grades shown below may be
   deferred by selection board action under 10 USC §637. See AFI 36-2501, Officer Promotion
   and Selective Continuation, for instructions on requesting continuation of twice non-selected
   officers.
       4.9.2.1. Retirement of a Regular captain who has twice failed selection for promotion to
       Regular major may be deferred to the last day of the month in which 20 years of active
       commissioned service is completed (10 USC §637(a)(2)).
       4.9.2.2. Retirement of a Regular major who has twice failed selection for promotion to
       Regular lieutenant colonel may be deferred to the last day of the month in which 24 years
       of active commissioned service is completed (10 USC §637(a)(3)).
       4.9.2.3. Retirement of a Regular colonel or lieutenant colonel who has completed the
       maximum service (Table 4.1) may be deferred (10 USC §637(b)(1)) for no more than 5
       years, but not later than officer’s 62nd birthday (10 USC §637(b)(3)).
       4.9.2.4. Retirement of a Regular brigadier general or major general who has completed
       the maximum service (Table 4.1), subject to the needs of the Air Force, may be deferred
       and the officer continued on active duty by the SAF. If serving in a grade above major
       general, retirement may be deferred and the officer continued on active duty by the
       President (10 USC §637(b)(2)). Any period of deferral of retirement and continuation on
       active duty can be for no more than 5 years but no later than the officer’s 62nd birthday
       [10 USC §637(b)(3)]. Exceptions can be found in 10 USC §1251.
4.10. Right to Retire Under Prior Law. Retire officers, who held or were on a promotion list
to the Regular (permanent) grade of colonel or major on 15 September 1981, under the laws in
effect on that date.
   4.10.1. Colonels in this situation retire on the 30th day after completing 30 years of service or
   retire on the 5th anniversary of their permanent promotion, whichever is later (10 USC
   §8921). Compute their service under 10 USC §8927.
   4.10.2. Eligible officers who, on 15 September 1981, held the Regular (permanent) grade of
   major, captain, or first lieutenant, and who have twice failed selection for promotion retire
   under 10 USC §8913. Compute their service under 10 USC §8927.
4.11. Selective Early Retirement. Under the provisions of 10 USC §638 & §14704, an Air
Force selection board may consider officers in the grade of captain through major general for
involuntary retirement earlier than their MSD (as shown in Table 4.1, rules 5 through 24).
Authority to select officers for early retirement will be used sparingly to manage an officer grade
imbalance or strength overage within a competitive category (DoD Directive [DoDD] 1332.32,
Selective Early Retirement of Officers on an Active Duty List and the Reserve Active Status List
and Selective Early Removal of Officers from the Reserve Active Status List). This authority may
not be used for the sole purpose of enhancing promotion opportunity, nor substituted for
disposition of officers who should be separated for cause. Selective Early Removal of Officers
from the Reserve Active Status List is addressed in AFI 36-3209, Separation and Retirement
Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members.

     4.11.1. Under HQ AFPC/DPPRR guidance, the senior rater completes an AF IMT 3538,
     Retention Recommendation, on all eligible officers considered by a SERB. For lieutenant
     colonels or colonels, the management level head or designated representative evaluates the
     recommendation. For captains and majors, the senior rater’s rater or designated
     representative evaluates the recommendation.
        4.11.1.1. Use the form to recommend officers for retention on active duty or selection for
        early retirement. If retirement is recommended, the senior rater gives a signed copy of the
        SERB recommendation to the officer, along with a letter advising the officer that they
        have the right to send a written rebuttal to the recommendation within 10 calendar days.
     4.11.2. An officer eligible for consideration by a SERB may send a letter to the board to
     arrive no later than the date the board convenes. The officer’s letter must be signed, the
     information provided must be accurate, and the officer must, if called upon, be able to
     support any statements made. The letter should be brief and concise, should not have any
     attachments and should not criticize nor reflect on the character, conduct, or motives of any
     officer. Address the letter to:
          President
          FY (insert the appropriate year and appropriate grade designation)
          Selective Early Retirement Board

          Randolph AFB TX 78150-4707
4.12. Special Board (SB). An officer selected for early retirement under 10 USC §638 and
§14704 may request an SB if the records contained an error when the officer met the original
SERB.
     4.12.1. An officer need not be granted SB consideration if, by exercising reasonable
     diligence, the officer should have discovered the error or omission and could have taken
     corrective action before adjournment of the originally-scheduled board.
     4.12.2. An eligible officer who was considered by a SERB and selected for early retirement
     may be considered by an SB if the SAF or person properly acting on behalf of the Secretary
     determines that:
        4.12.2.1. The original SERB that considered the officers was contrary to law or involved
        material error of fact or material administrative error; or
        4.12.2.2. The original SERB did not consider material information that should have been
        available had the SERB complied with pertinent Air Force instructions and policies.
     4.12.3. Officers who believe their selection for early retirement was in error or unjust may
     request a correction to their record to include consideration by an SB as specified below:
        4.12.3.1. Individuals who entered retired status and believe their record contained an
        error (paragraph 4.12.2.1 and/or 4.12.2.2) must submit DD Form 149, Application for
        Correction of Military Records Under the Provisions of Title 10, U.S. Code, Section
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                   49


     1552, to the AFBCMR per AFI 36-2603, Air Force Board for Correction of Military
     Records. (10 USC §1552)
     4.12.3.2. Individuals who have not yet retired and who believe their selection for early
     retirement was in error (paragraph 4.12.2.1 or 4.12.2.2) may apply for relief through the
     AFBCMR process or, if the officer believes that the selection for early retirement was
     due to an error in an officer performance report (OPR), the officer may apply for report
     correction under the provisions of AFI 36-2401, Correcting Officer and Enlisted
     Evaluation Reports. In addition to providing justification for OPR correction or removal
     on the AF IMT 948, Application for Correction/Removal of Evaluation Report, the
     officer must include a specific request for SB consideration.
     4.12.3.3. If the error does not involve an officer performance report, an application can
     still be made to the Executive Director, Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC/CD) through
     the Evaluation Reports Appeal Board (AFPC/DPPAB). There is no specific form
     required for this application but it must contain a specific request for consideration by an
     SB and sufficient information to show that the original SERB’s performance was
     contrary to law, involved material error of fact, material administrative error, or did not
     consider material information that should have been available had the SERB complied
     with pertinent AF instructions and policies.
     4.12.3.4. If an error is discovered and corrected, the AFPC Executive Director may
     direct that an SB be convened. Timeliness is important because all action will cease if an
     application for relief cannot be processed prior to the applicant’s MSD. Officers who
     have been selected for early retirement will not be retained on active duty beyond the
     statutorily-prescribed time limit in 10 USC §638. Applications to the AFBCMR, as
     specified in paragraph 4.12.3.1 above, are not affected by this deadline.
  4.12.4. Procedures for the SB. Officers who will be considered by a SERB SB will be
  notified in writing by HQ AFPC/DPPAB and will be provided an opportunity to send a
  personal letter to the Board. (NOTE: An officer’s application for correction of record must
  specifically request consideration by the SB if the officer’s correction of records is
  approved).
     4.12.4.1. Special Boards may be convened separately or in conjunction with other
     regularly scheduled boards. Board composition will meet the requirements of the original
     board.
     4.12.4.2. Special Boards will consider the record of the officer, so far as feasible, as it
     would have appeared to the original boards had the officer been properly considered with
     correct records.
     4.12.4.3. The officer’s record will be compared with a sampling of records of officers of
     the same competitive category who were and who were not selected for early retirement
     by the original boards.
     4.12.4.4. A written report of the results of the SB, signed by each board member, will be
     submitted to the SAF for approval. The report will list the name of each officer
     considered by the SB who is selected for early retirement and the name of each officer
     recommended for retention on active duty. The report will indicate which officers were
     considered under paragraph 4.12.2.1 above, (legal, administrative or material error of
50                                                              AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


        facts), and which officers were considered under paragraph 4.12.2.2 above (lack of
        material information). Officers approved for retention through the SB will have their
        retirement date established under the SERB removed. Once the SERB establishes a
        retirement date for the officers not selected for retention, no changes to their retirement
        date will be made. However, these individuals retain the right to appeal their non-
        selection through the AFBCMR.
        4.12.4.5. The SAF or designee must approve the results of all SBs convened to consider
        officers for involuntary retirements.
        4.12.4.6. The officer will be notified of the board results after they are approved.
4.13. Suspension of Mandatory Retirement of Regular and Reserve Officers Due to War or
National Emergency (Stop Loss). In times of war or national emergency declared by Congress
or the President, the President may suspend the operation of laws relating to mandatory
retirement of regular and reserve officers (10 USC §123 & §12305). This authority will be
exercised sparingly depending on service needs and the nature of the emergency. Each case will
be considered on its own merits and final decision rests with the SAF. Officers retained beyond
their MSD will stay on active duty until the Secretary determines their services are no longer
needed to support the present emergency. Officers with MSDs will have up to 90 days after
termination of Stop Loss before they must retire.
     4.13.1. When mandatory retirements are suspended, HQ USAF/DPPPA notifies HQ
     AFPC/DPPR to announce the suspension and give instructions by AIG message (includes
     MINIMIZE).

NOTES:
1. Under 10 USC §1251(c), the Air Force may defer Regular medical officers, dental officers,
and nurses from retirement until age 68 if, during the period of deferment, the officers perform
duties consisting primarily of providing patient care or performing other clinical duties, or duties
necessary to meet the needs of the Air Force. The Air Force may also defer the retirement of an
officer who is appointed or designated as a chaplain until age 68 if it is determined that such
deferral is in the best interest of the Air Force.
2. Retire a Regular colonel who, on 15 September 1981, was serving in or on a recommended list
for promotion to that grade under 10 USC §8921 unless the colonel receives promotion to the
Regular grade of brigadier general or continues on active duty by selection board action under 10
USC §637. (Although 10 USC §8921 was repealed on 15 September 1981, it still applies to
officers who held the grade of colonel on that date.)
3. Before an officer can be considered for the position of Superintendent of the United States Air
Force Academy (USAFA),10 USC §9333 requires that the officer enter into an agreement with
the SAF to signify that the officer will accept retirement upon termination of the detail unless
such retirement is waived under 10 USC §8921(b).

                        RETIREMENT MEDICAL EXAMINATION

5.1. Standard Medical Examination. Members who are retiring for length of service may
request a physical examination, although law does not specifically require one.
   5.1.1. The medical treatment facility (MTF) uses the guidance in AFI 48-123 to determine
   the scope of the medical examination by considering the date of member’s last examination
   When an examination is necessary, do not delay the scheduled retirement because of an
   incomplete examination.
5.2. Optional Examination. Unless one or more of the conditions listed here apply, the
member decides whether to have a physical examination.
   5.2.1. The MPF presumes the member is physically fit unless it has clear and convincing
   evidence to the contrary.
   5.2.2. To determine whether an examination is required, there should be evidence coming
   from the member’s periodic physicals, hospitalizations, clinic visits, or through the member’s
   commander under AFIs 48-123 and 36-3212 that could result in disability retirement.
   5.2.3. Follow guidance in AFI 48-123 regarding the extent of the examination.
   5.2.4. Members who do not wish to have an examination will sign a statement to that effect
   as shown in AFI 36-2102.
   5.2.5. Members who choose to have an examination (see Table 3.2, rule 4) are scheduled for
   the earliest possible date, but not earlier than 1 year and no later than 60 days before
   retirement.
5.3. Mandatory Examination. A retirement physical examination is required if:
   5.3.1. Member has a 4-T physical profile or is on limited assignment status (LAS).
   (EXCEPTION: Members kept on LAS only because they have allergic reactions to certain
   immunizations.) Process members on LAS according to AFI 36-3212.
   5.3.2. Other reasons to conduct an examination are:
       5.3.2.1. Medical authority decides an examination is necessary. It may include
       consultations, special studies, or medical board proceedings.
       5.3.2.2. If the member has not had a standard periodic examination within 3 years of the
       retirement date.
       5.3.2.3. If the member is a repatriated prisoner of war.
5.4. Administrative Guidelines.
   5.4.1. Member who chooses to have a medical examination: The MPF notifies the MTF to
   set up the medical examination when members are within 12 months of their requested
   retirement date. Provide the member's name, social security number (SSN) and retirement
   date.
56                                                            AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


        5.4.1.1. The medical facility uses the guidance in AFI 48123 to determine the
        requirement and scope of the examination. The medical facility schedules the
        examination to begin within 10 workdays after the member makes the election. If the
        member’s retirement date is less than 60 calendar days away, the medical facility asks
        HQ AFPC/DPAMM for scheduling instructions, or to discuss situations where a Review
        In Lieu Of Medical Evaluation Board will suffice.
     5.4.2. The MPF notifies the member of the date and time to report to the medical facility.
        5.4.2.1. If the member does not want an examination, the MPF checks paragraph 5.3 to
        see if an examination is required. If required under paragraph 5.3.1, or if the medical
        facility must make a determination under paragraph 5.3.2, the MPF sends the member’s
        non-election statement to the MTF giving the member’s name, grade, SSN, and
        retirement date.
     5.4.3. If an examination is required, the MTF schedules an appointment,notifies the MPF
     and the member of the scheduled examination..
     5.4.4. If the member does not require a physical examination, the MTF endorses the
     member’s non-election statement and returns it to the MPF according to Table 3.2, rule 5.
     5.4.5. The member’s commander must make sure that the member is available for
     examination until medical processing is completed.
     5.4.6. Directors of base medical services and commanders of medical treatment centers
     make complete the examination and required laboratory tests on time and monitor
     consultations, including those performed at other facilities.
     5.4.7. The medical facility commander will make certain that the examination is completed
     at least 60 days before the scheduled retirement date.
        5.4.7.1. For members qualified for continued active duty, the MTF files the medical
        report in the health record subgroup of the member’s FPRG. No further action is
        necessary.
        5.4.7.2. If the member's medical condition is questionable, the MTF sends SF Form 88,
        Report of Medical Examination, with attachments, to HQ AFPC/DPAMM for review.
        5.4.7.3. Retirement processing continues on the presumption that the member is
        medically qualified for continued duty unless HQ AFPC/DPAMM places the member in
        medical hold status according to AFI 48-123.
     5.4.8. HQ AFPC/DPAMM decides if the member is qualified for retirement.
        5.4.8.1. If the member is qualified, HQ AFPC/DPAMM stamps "Return to Duty" on the
        review and returns the review to the medical facility for filing in member’s health
        records.
        5.4.8.2. If the member is not medically qualified, HQ AFPC/DPAMM places member on
        medical hold if within 60 days of scheduled retirement date. HQ AFPC/DPAMM sends
        instructions by message to the medical facility with an information copy to HQ
        AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts or AF/DPO for colonels and colonel selectees), HQ
        AFPC/DPPD, the servicing MPF, and the appropriate MAJCOM/SG directing further
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    57


       evaluation that may include Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) and Physical Evaluation
       Board (PEB) action. Message also informs the MPF that member is on medical hold.
   5.4.9. HQ AFPC/DPAMM notifies the MTF and appropriate MAJCOM/SG if, after
   reviewing the MEB from the medical treatment facility, it directs a PEB.
       5.4.9.1. HQ AFPC/DPPD sends the results of the disability proceedings to DPAMM,
       DPPRR, or AF/DPE for CMSgts or AF/DPO for colonels and colonel selectees, the
       servicing MPF and the MTF.
5.5. Physical Examination of General Officers and Medical Service Officers.
   5.5.1. General Officers asking for, or requiring, a physical examination under paragraph 5.1
   are examined at a medical facility chosen by the MAJCOM surgeon who makes sure that the
   examination is completed at least 90 days before retirement, if time permits. General
   Officers working at Air Staff and the Secretariat may receive a physical examination from
   the primary care provider under which they are empanelled. If the officer is qualified for
   continued active duty, send the Report of Medical Examination and related documents to the
   base where the officer is assigned to be put in the officer’s health record subgroup.
       5.5.1.1. If the officer's medical qualification is in doubt, send the Report of Medical
       Examination and related documents to HQ USAF/SGP, Washington DC 20314, who
       advises HQ AFPC/ DPAMM of actions to be taken according to paragraph 5.4.7.2
       5.5.1.2. In all cases, send an information copy of the examination report and attachments
       to HQ AFPC/DPAMM. Also advise AF/DPG whenever an MTF or other authority
       recommends processing a general officer through disability channels.
   5.5.2. Medical Service Officers (Other Than General Officers). Officers of the Biomedical
   Sciences Corps (BSC), Dental Corps (DC), Medical Corps (MC), Medical Service Corps
   (MSC), Nurse Corps (NC), and Veterinary Corps (VC), who ask for, or require, an
   examination according to paragraph 5.1, may use their own facility. If the examination
   results in an MEB then PEB action, AFI 36-3212 applies.
5.6. Medical Treatment Before Effective Date of Retirement. If a member with an approved
retirement date is considered for, or undergoes, an elective medical or surgical procedure that is
not expected to disqualify the member from continued active duty, the member is retired on the
approved (or mandatory) retirement date, even though medical care may be needed after that
date. If the condition could make the member’s qualification for continued active duty
questionable (presumption of fitness may apply), or the member has an urgent or emergency
medical condition requiring hospitalization and convalescence, HQ AFPC/DPAMM may
authorize placement of the member on medical hold. For approval of elective surgical procedures
within six months of retirement, refer to AFI 48-123, paragraph 5.5.4.
5.7. Procedures for Initiating a Medical Hold. If a member is within 60 days of the
retirement date and a medical officer determines that the member is not qualified for worldwide
duty, the MTF sends a diagnostic summary and full justification for placing a member on
medical hold to HQ AFPC/DPAMM. The MTF includes all known information as to the status
of the retirement application and informs the MPF that they have transmitted a medical hold
request to HQ AFPC for their action. The MTF informs the member and the member’s servicing
MPF of the possibility of medical hold action and of any later action HQ AFPC takes. Enlisted
58                                                            AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


members may waive the medical hold in writing. Officers may not waive the medical hold
because they serve at the direction of the President.
     5.7.1. The MPF keeps an active suspense file when told that the member may be placed in
     medical hold by HQ AFPC/DPAMM. The MPF counsels the member on their retirement
     status. If the MPF has not requested rescission of retirement orders and the member is not
     available to start retirement processing, check with local MTF to find out member’s status.
     Contact HQ AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts or AF/DPO for colonels and colonel
     selectees) if status cannot be determined locally. Tell the member at once if the status of the
     retirement orders changes.
        5.7.1.1. MPFs must ensure member’s date of separation (DOS) is updated appropriately.
     5.7.2. Action by HQ AFPC/DPAMM:
        5.7.2.1. Decides if medical hold is warranted and then sends instructions to the MTF.
        Sets a date for completing reevaluation and disposition of member’s case. Tells HQ
        AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts or AF/DPO for colonels and colonel selectees) if
        medical hold is approved.
        5.7.2.2. Tells MAJCOM Surgeon General (SG) of suspense date furnished to the MTF.
        The MAJCOM/SG monitors the medical hold case to ensure prompt processing.
     5.7.3. Actions by HQ AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts or AF/DPO for colonels and
     colonel selectees):
        5.7.3.1. Rescinds retirement order when told that member is on medical hold. Lets the
        MPF know by phone or message that orders were rescinded. Places the case in suspense
        until a final medical decision is made.
        5.7.3.2. If on, or within 10 days of, the scheduled retirement date, no final medical
        decision has been made, makes sure that member’s retirement date is delayed 3 months at
        a time until receipt of notice from HQ AFPC/DPAMM that member has been returned to
        duty or HQ AFPC/DPPD informs HQ AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts or AF/DPO
        for colonels and colonel selectees) that the member is retiring for disability (see AFI 36-
        3212). If needed, they will adjust the HYT.
        5.7.3.3. After HQ AFPC/DPAMM notifies agencies that the member is fit for duty, the
        MPF notifies HQ AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE for CMSgts or AF/DPO for colonels and
        colonel selectees) of member’s desired retirement date (to include number of days
        terminal leave, authorized PTDY, and the number of days member has sold since 10
        February 1976).
            5.7.3.3.1. If the member is returned to duty and time permits, retire the member for
            length of service on the date previously scheduled.
            5.7.3.3.2. If the previously scheduled retirement date is not mandatory and has
            passed or does not permit proper processing time, issue retirement orders according to
            the guidance above.
            5.7.3.3.3. If the previously scheduled retirement date is mandatory and has passed or
            does not permit proper processing time, upon termination of medical hold, officers

        with mandatory retirement dates may extend their retirement date for no more than 30
        days after termination of medical hold.

                                             Chapter 6

                             RECOGNITION ON RETIREMENT

6.1. Recognition of Members Being Retired.
     6.1.1. Tradition. One of the oldest traditions of military service is to recognize members who
     are retiring from a career of long and honorable service. Military members should retire with
     a tangible expression of appreciation for their contribution to the Air Force and our mission.
     They retire with the assurance that they will continue to be members of the Air Force family
     in retirement.
     6.1.2. Responsibility. Commanders must evaluate and recognize the contributions of their
     retiring members. Commanders will conduct a retirement ceremony for all retiring members
     unless the member specifically requests not to have a ceremony. At overseas bases for those
     returning to the CONUS for retirement, the overseas commander should hold a retirement
     ceremony, presenting the DD Form 363AF, Certificate of Retirement, at the overseas base.
     If the ceremony cannot be held at the overseas base, the ceremony will be held at the
     CONUS separation base. As part of the advance notice required by paragraph 2.5, the
     overseas MPF must tell the CONUS MPF that the ceremony must be conducted at the
     CONUS base unless the member does not want a ceremony.
     6.1.3. Ceremony. All members must be offered a formal ceremony. This courtesy should be
     in keeping with the customs and traditions of the service, conducted by a general officer
     when possible. The commander is ultimately responsible to conduct the retirement ceremony,
     meeting the basic intent of this military function. If the member prefers to have an informal
     retirement ceremony, commanders have leeway to conduct the ceremony as they see fit. To
     conduct the ceremony, the member may request a particular AF military member, retired
     military member or federal civilian employee; who is authorized by the retiring member’s
     commander; and the requested presenter must agree to conduct the ceremony. Ceremonies
     can be part of formal military formations, such as retreat and parades when conditions
     permit. Commanders and supervisors should encourage retirement ceremony attendance by
     unit personnel, relatives, friends, photographers, information service personnel, and local
     public relations representatives.
        6.1.3.1. At the ceremony present:
            6.1.3.1.1. DD Form 363AF, Certificate of Retirement.
            6.1.3.1.2. United States Flag. NOTE: Appropriated local Base O&M funds are
            authorized for procurement of these flags at no cost to the member. 10 USC §8681
            authorizes the presentation of a US flag for all retiring members.
            6.1.3.1.3. Air Force Retired Lapel Button.
            6.1.3.1.4. DD Form 2542, Certificate of Appreciation for Service in the Armed
            Forces of the United States.
            6.1.3.1.5. If appropriate, the Presidential Letter of Appreciation (see paragraph 6.5).
            6.1.3.1.6. Any awards, decoration, honors, or letters of appreciation.
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                  61


         6.1.3.1.7. If appropriate, the AF Form 1344, Certificate of Appreciation (for
         Spouse of Retiring Member (see paragraph 6.3).
     6.1.3.2. Commanders will follow formal ceremony procedures unless the member
     prefers an informal ceremony. If the member chooses not to have a formal or informal
     ceremony or cannot be present for duty on the retirement date due to leave or
     hospitalization, cannot be present for duty, the member’s commander, or an officer
     designated by the commander, will personally present the DD Form 363AF, AF Form
     1344, retired lapel button, US Flag and any awards or honors that express appreciation
     for the member’s service. Do not mail the retirement certificate to a retirement address
     unless you have no other choice.
     6.1.3.3. Non-EAD members who are retiring or transferring to the Retired Reserve may
     request a retirement ceremony. Members should make arrangements with host officials
     for a ceremony. (NOTE: The member pays for any travel expense.) Issue a DD Form
     363AF to members who are entitled to retired pay under any provision of law. For
     officers, the DD Form 363AF will reveal the highest grade satisfactorily held in lieu of
     current grade. Enlisted members—in general—retire in the grade they hold on the last
     day of active duty. Present a US Flag to Air Force members transferred from an active
     status or discharged after completion of eligibility for retired pay at no cost to the
     member (10 USC §12605).
  6.1.4. Letter of Appreciation. The unit commander or senior officer of the member’s unit
  prepares and presents a letter of appreciation to members who retire with 30 years active
  federal military service. Those with less than 30 years active service get a letter at the
  discretion of their commander.
     6.1.4.1. AF/DPG prepares the letter for general officers.
     6.1.4.2. The commander or senior officer of the member’s unit prepares all other letters.
     If the member retires in a higher grade, the letter is addressed in the higher grade and is
     presented with the DD Form 363AF.
     6.1.4.3. A letter is not prepared if the:
         6.1.4.3.1. Member is retiring in place of demotion, elimination, or other
         administrative action; or
         6.1.4.3.2. Member’s service is marred by administrative admonitions, punishment,
         reprimands, or mediocre performance.
  6.1.5. Decorations and Awards. If a commander recommends a retiring member for a
  decoration, submit the recommendation far enough in advance so that, if approved, it may be
  presented at the retirement ceremony. The recommendation must reach the approving
  headquarters at least 60 days before the retirement ceremony. Before retirement, members
  should have received every award and decoration earned during their career. If conducting a
  single ceremony for several retiring members, those who do not receive an award may
  request a separate ceremony separate from those who receive awards.
  6.1.6. Checklist. The retirement ceremony is of great significance to the member, so
  commanders must actively prepare for the ceremony (see paragraph 6.1.3 for exceptions). To
62                                                              AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


     help prevent error or oversight that might offend the retiree, their family, or friends, those
     who are designated to arrange the ceremony should observe the following checklist:
        6.1.6.1. Determine type of ceremony desired (formal or informal). The commander will
        schedule a formal ceremony and notify the member. Schedule an informal ceremony if
        the member prefers it.
        6.1.6.2. Determine status of award recommendations and make sure all award elements
        (that is, certificates, letters, medals) and the retirement certificate are available. If
        possible, avoid using “dummy” elements the retiree cannot keep.
        6.1.6.3. Place the ceremony date and time on commander’s calendar, providing details
        such as awards to be presented and guests who will be present. Announce the ceremony
        in advance so friends and associates can arrange to attend.
        6.1.6.4. Prepare autobiographical remarks for commander’s use.
        6.1.6.5. Reserve room or suitable location for the ceremony. Find out the number of
        personal guests, their names, relationship to the retiree and arrange seating.
        6.1.6.6. Designate a proctor to read, from notes (not from the order), a summary of the
        pertinent information shown on the retirement order, and the citation accompanying any
        award presentations.
        6.1.6.7. Designate one person to be in charge of bringing all elements to the ceremony.
        6.1.6.8. Arrange for photographer.
6.2. DD Form 363AF, Certificate of Retirement. The certificate is completed and signed as
shown in Table 6.1. and Table 6.2. Airmen who complete 20 or more years of active military
service, and Airmen who are permanently retired for disability but have not completed 20 years
of active military service may be issued the certificate. Airmen who are placed on the temporary
disability retired list (TDRL) are not issued the certificate unless their status changes to a
permanent retirement, either for years of service or disability. For presentation, the DD Form
363AF is placed on the right side of the binder (National Stock Number 7510-00-134-8179) and
the letter of appreciation on the left side. If there is no letter of appreciation, substitute a copy of
the retirement order.
     6.2.1. See Table 6.1. for the offices responsible for preparing the DD Form 363AF.
     6.2.2. See Table 6.2. for information on how to complete the DD Form 363AF.
     6.2.3. The DD Form 363AF changes when a new Air Force Chief of Staff (CSAF) takes
     office. If the effective date of retirement is on or after the new CSAF’s appointment date,
     use certificates with the new CSAF’s signature. The new certificates bearing the name of the
     new CSAF may not be immediately available; therefore, take the following actions:
        6.2.3.1. If the new certificates do not arrive in time for the retirement:
            6.2.3.1.1. Advise the retiring member their certificates will be mailed at a later date.
            6.2.3.1.2. Keep a listing of these members’ forwarding addresses.
            6.2.3.1.3. When mailing, use protective mailing material to prevent mutilation of
            documents and binder.
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                       63


           6.2.3.1.4. Use existing certificates at retirement ceremony for photographs; however,
           make sure the retiree is told their actual certificates will be mailed at a later date.
6.3. AF Form 1344, Certificate of Appreciation (for Spouse of Retiring Member). If
appropriate, the spouse of an Airmen who retires after 20 or more years of active military
service, and Airmen who are permanently retired for disability but have not completed 20 years
of active military service may be issued the certificate. Spouses of Airmen who are placed on
the TDRL whose status changes to a permanent retirement, whether for years of service or
disability, are issued a spouse certificate.

   whether the spouse is present. Present the certificate of appreciation in a binder (National
   Stock Number 7510-00-134-8179).
6.4. AF Form 423, Certificate of Appreciation (for Spouse of Retiring Selected Reserve
Member). The spouse of a non-EAD Reserve member who retires from the Selected Reserve
(that is, those reservists eligible for retired pay at age 60 and assigned to training category A, B,
or D) may be presented AF Form 423, if appropriate.
6.5. Presidential Recognition on Retirement from Military Service. Present a DD Form
2542, Certificate of Appreciation for Service in the Armed Forces of the United States, which
bears the signature and seal of the President, to each member of the active and Reserve forces
retiring on or after 1 October 1989. Airmen who complete 20 or more years of active military
service and Airmen who are permanently retired for disability but have not completed 20 years
of active military service may be issued the certificate. At the retirement ceremony, present the
certificate along with other documents (see paragraph 6.1). Airmen who are placed on the
TDRL whose status changes to a permanent retirement, whether for years of service or disability,
are issued a Certificate of Appreciation for Service. Airmen will receive a DD Form 2542 with
the name of the President in office at the time of the Airman’s retirement. When a new president
takes office, use the procedures outlined in paragraph 6.2.3 until DD Forms 2542 with the
signature of the new president are received.
   6.5.1. The MPF or member's commander’s support staff prepares the certificate for
   authorized EAD members.
   6.5.2. The MPF:
       6.5.2.1. Prepares the DD Form 2542 for non-EAD Reserve members eligible to receive
       retired pay under any provision of law.
       6.5.2.2. Sends it, along with DD Form 363AF, to the member’s unit for presentation at
       the retirement ceremony, or to any other location the member designates.
       6.5.2.3. Sends the DD Form 2542, along with DD Form 363AF, for presentation to non-
       EAD members being transferred to the Retired Reserve who will receive retired pay
       under 10 USC §12731, but have not reached age 60.

     6.5.3. Letter of Appreciation from the President of the United States. Prepare the letter of
     appreciation by following the format in Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 1348.34,
     Presidential Recognition on Retirement from Military Service. The letter is presented to:
        6.5.3.1. Regular, Guard, and Reserve personnel retiring on or after 1 October 1989 with

     6.5.6. The MPF or ARPC/DPPR provides all pertinent service information and the reason
     member qualifies for the recognition (such as, “former prisoner of war; qualifies for POW
     Medal”).
     6.5.7. AF/DPG sends request on behalf of general officers, AF/DPO on colonels and colonel
     selects, and AF/DPE on CMSgts.

                      DETERMINING RETIRED GRADE AND PAY

7.1. General Information. The MPF counsels personnel who are not yet retired on their retired
pay. This chapter is a guide to help MPFs and members who are near retirement to estimate
retired pay and gives general information about retired grade and pay, advancement on the
retired list, and computation of service under laws now in effect, including those implemented by
the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) effective 15 September 1981 (Public
Law 96-513). This chapter is not intended to be a complete and authoritative source of reference
on these subjects and does not imply any right, benefit or privilege with respect to retirements.
This information does not pertain to retired Reserve who will be eligible for pay at age 60 (see
Chapter 9). Retired pay estimates for disability retirees is in AFI 36-3212.
7.2. General Rules on Retired Grade.
   7.2.1. A commissioned officer retiring for other than disability and for other than age and
   service requirements (10 USC §12731) is retired in the highest grade held on active duty
   satisfactorily, as determined by the SAF or designee, for at least 6 months. There are
   additional legal restrictions that must be met for “voluntary” retirement in any grade higher
   than major (10 USC §1370).
       7.2.1.1. To voluntarily retire in any grade higher than major, an officer must have served
       a minimum of 3 years of active duty in that grade unless granted a waiver.
       7.2.1.2. The SAF or designee determines if the service was satisfactorily held while on
       active duty in that grade.
       7.2.1.3. The President may approve retirement of an officer above the grade of major
       who does not meet the 3-year TIG criteria if the officer has at least 6 months of
       satisfactory active duty in that grade. This Presidential authority is used only in cases
       involving extreme hardship or exceptional or unusual circumstances (10 USC
       §1370(a)(2)(D)). This Presidential waiver authority cannot be delegated. Requests must
       include strong justification and documentation to support “extreme hardship” or
       “exceptional or unusual circumstances.”
       7.2.1.4. Officers who do not meet the minimum TIG requirements, or whose waivers are
       not approved, retire in the next lower grade held on active duty satisfactorily for at least 6
       months, as determined by the SAF or designee (10 USC §1370(b)).
   7.2.2. Reserve officers who apply for retirement under 10 USC §8911 after being told they
   will be released from active duty involuntarily, retire in the highest grade held on active duty
   satisfactorily for at least 6 months (10 USC §1370 (a)(3)).
   7.2.3. If enlisted members of the Regular forces retire for other than disability, they retire in
   the Regular grade held on the date of retirement unless entitled to a higher grade under some
   other provision of law. Reserve enlisted members of the Air Force who retire under 10 USC
   §8914 after September 30, 1996 may be entitled to a higher grade held satisfactorily on
   active duty as a reserve/guard member (10 USC §8963). The SAF or designee determines the
   retired grade provided there is no evidence of record to indicate unsatisfactory service in the
68                                                             AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


     higher grade. Specifically, this provision applies to reserve enlisted members who have been
     reduced in grade not as a result of the member’s misconduct, but rather as an administrative
     reduction.
7.3. Higher Retired Grade for Regular Commissioned Officers in Special Positions. A
permanent professor of USAFA who is in a grade below brigadier general and whose service as
such professor has been long and distinguished may, at the discretion of the President, retire in
the grade of brigadier general (10 USC §8962 & §1370, and paragraph 4.8 of this AFI). Use the
rates for the grade held on the last day of active duty to compute retired pay. Air Staff agencies
preparing retirement orders should address the member as “Colonel” and indicate “Colonel” in
the “Highest Grade Held on Active Duty” space under the “Pay Grade” portion of the order. The
“Retired In” space of the “Pay Grade” portion should reflect “nBrigadier General.” The
following statement should be placed in the “Remarks” portion of the order: “nRetired in the
grade of Brigadier General under the provision of 10 USC §8962.” These remarks will indicate
to DFAS that this retired grade is a title change and does not result in a pay change.
7.4. Advancing Regular Enlisted Members to a Higher Grade After 30 Years of Service.
     7.4.1. When regular enlisted members’ and certain reserve enlisted members’ active service
     plus service on the retired list totals 30 years, they may be advanced on the retired list to the
     highest grade served on active duty satisfactorily and receive retired pay in that grade, as
     determined by the SAF or designee under 10 USC §8964 (see Table 3.2, note 3 for
     processing procedures). See paragraph 7.7 for re-computation of retired pay after
     advancement.
     7.4.2. SAFPC announces the SAF decision in the following cases:
        7.4.2.1. When the highest grade held was terminated for cause (unless member held the
        higher grade for at least 6 months during a previous period of service and received an
        honorable discharge in the higher grade).
        7.4.2.2. When evidence leaves doubt that the member served satisfactorily in the higher
        grade.
        7.4.2.3. When the member holds the higher grade at time of retirement and retirement is
        due to elimination or demotion action.
        7.4.2.4. When the member is eligible for advancement on the retired list and held the
        highest grade on active duty for less than 6 months (under 10 USC §8964). NOTE: If
        service in the highest grade held on active duty was unsatisfactory and the retired grade
        of the member is two or more grades lower than the highest grade held, the member may
        be advanced on the retired list to the highest grade served on active duty satisfactorily, as
        determined by the SAF or designee.
        7.4.2.5. When the member is eligible for advancement to a higher active duty grade
        attained after retirement (10 USC §8964). Retirees may be advanced to a higher retired
        grade if they were demoted, are officers with prior service, or retired members who held
        positions in active Reserve organizations after retirement. To be considered for
        advancement, enlisted members who have a retired grade lower than the highest grade
        held on active duty for at least 6 months must send copies of documents verifying each
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    69


       period of active service while holding the higher grade (see Table 3.2) to HQ
       AFPC/DPPRR or to other appropriate order-issuing authority.
   7.4.3. Restoration of Former Grade. Retired enlisted members who have been advanced on
   the retired list to a higher commissioned grade may be restored to their former retired
   enlisted status if approved by the SAF or designee.
       7.4.3.1. Within 3 months after being advanced, members send requests to HQ
       AFPC/DPPRR or to other appropriate order-issuing authority.
       7.4.3.2. An election to return to a former grade is not reversible (29 Comptroller General
       179; 10 USC §8965).
7.5. Officer Grade Determination (OGD) in Conjunction with Retirement (10 USC
§1370). The SAF or designee may retire an officer in a grade lower than the highest grade held
when a determination is made that the officer did not serve satisfactorily in the higher grade.
   7.5.1. Commander’s/Supervisor’s Responsibility. The SAF or designee, any Air Force
   commander, general officer or SES equivalent in the officer’s chain of command or
   supervision may initiate an OGD. When a commander or SES equivalent above the unit
   commander initiates an OGD, obtain and include comments made by subordinate
   commanders or SES equivalents. (EXCEPTION: 11th Wing command comments are not
   required for HQ USAF personnel.)
       7.5.1.1. Process an OGD recommendation for decision to the SAF or designee through
       the member’s Air Force chain of command or supervision with local JA review.
       7.5.1.2. The SAF reviews each general officer retirement application to determine
       whether initiation of an OGD is appropriate. Lower level authorities in the general
       officer’s chain of command or supervision may also initiate an OGD.
   7.5.2. Initiating an OGD. The unit commander or other appropriate authority (including an
   authority designated for this purpose by the SAF or designee) will initiate an OGD when:
       7.5.2.1. The officer has applied for retirement in lieu of court-martial or administrative
       separation action (Table 2.2, rules 12 and 15). In this case, an OGD is made in
       conjunction with the SAF decision as to whether the officer will be permitted to retire.
       7.5.2.2. The officer has a court-martial conviction.
       7.5.2.3. The officer has a civil court conviction for misconduct involving moral turpitude
       or in which the sentence includes confinement for one year or more without regard to
       suspension or probation.
       7.5.2.4. If, within 2 years of the date of the application for retirement, the officer
       received nonjudicial punishment pursuant to an Article 15, Uniform Code of Military
       Justice (UCMJ).
       7.5.2.5. In any other case in which the commander or other appropriate authority
       believes an OGD is appropriate. Factors commanders or supervisors should consider
       include, but are not limited to, misconduct which has fallen short of a criminal conviction
       or Article 15, UCMJ punishment (such as conduct resulting in a UIF and/or letter of
       reprimand) or substandard performance of duty which has resulted in a referral officer
       performance report (OPR).

     7.5.3. When an officer applies for retirement, the unit commander, or any SAF designee, Air
     Force commander or SES equivalent in the officer’s chain of command or supervision, will
     review the officer’s record to determine if any of the above conditions exist. If not, the
     commander acknowledges the retirement application by signing the AF IMT 1160. If the
     commander decides to initiate an OGD, the commander notifies the officer, in writing, that
     an OGD is being initiated stating the reasons for the OGD (see sample at Figure 7.1); gives
     the officer 10 calendar days to submit comments or rebuttal; and then recommends to the
     wing commander or appropriate supervisor what action should be taken regarding the
     officer’s retirement grade (see sample at Figure 7.2).
     7.5.4. MPF Responsibilities. When the MPF receives the retirement application (AF IMT
     1160) the MPF reviews the commander’s following statements:
        7.5.4.1. Officer (has/has not) had a court-martial conviction.
        7.5.4.2. Officer (has/has not) had a civil court conviction.
        7.5.4.3. Officer (has/has not) been punished pursuant to Article 15, UCMJ, within 2
        years of this retirement application.
        7.5.4.4. I (do/do not) find another basis for an officer grade determination. (If another
        basis exists, specify here: ). (Requires the commander’s signature. NOTE: The
        commander initiating the OGD must be equal to or higher in grade than the officer
        requesting retirement).
        7.5.4.5. If answers to all questions are negative and the commander has signed the AF
        IMT 1160, the MPF continues normal processing.
     7.5.5. If the commander answers any questions affirmatively, an OGD must be initiated. The
     wing commander/senior rater must sign a statement explaining the basis for not initiating an
     OGD. The MPF processes the application for retirement (AF IMT 1160) as appropriate and
     attaches applicable documents to the application, such as:
        7.5.5.1. Unit commander’s recommendation and wing commander’s endorsement.
        7.5.5.2. Officer’s comments.
        7.5.5.3. Court-martial charges or letter of notification of involuntary administrative
        discharge and underlying evidence.
        7.5.5.4. Court-martial package to include order, Article 32, UCMJ, investigation and
        record of trial.
        7.5.5.5. Article 15, UCMJ, to include a complete copy of the entire official record of
        Article 15 proceedings.
        7.5.5.6. Any documents applicable to a civil court conviction.
        7.5.5.7. Copy of letter of reprimand, UIF , or other documentation of misconduct or
        substandard performance of duty, as applicable.
        7.5.5.8. All OERs/OPRs written on the officer while in the higher grade and, at least, the
        OPRs covering the grade immediately preceding the current grade.
     7.5.6. The MPF forwards the OGD package to the MAJCOM/DPP with local JA review.
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                  71


   7.5.7. The MPF forwards a copy of the transmittal sheet to HQ AFPC/DPPRR (or AF/DPO
   if the officer is a colonel or colonel select).
   7.5.8. If the wing commander determines an OGD is not appropriate, the MPF processes the
   retirement application as a routine action, but must ensure the unit commander’s
   recommendation and wing commander’s endorsement are attached to the AF IMT 1160 and
   filed as a permanent document in the Unit Personnel Record Group (UPRG).
   7.5.9. If an officer has applied for retirement and it is later determined that an OGD is
   required, the MPF immediately notifies HQ AFPC/DPPRR or AF/DPO (if officer is colonel
   or colonel select) who will suspend the retirement whenever possible.
      7.5.9.1. Processing of an OGD will not suspend a Regular officer’s mandatory
      retirement.
      7.5.9.2. An OGD must be finalized prior to retirement because, once an officer is retired,
      that retirement grade remains effective, regardless of determinations made subsequent to
      the effective retirement date.
   7.5.10. MAJCOM/DPP Responsibilities. If an OGD is required, the MAJCOM/DPP or
   equivalent will:
      7.5.10.1. Review the package to ensure all required documents are contained in the
      OGD.
      7.5.10.2. Ensure MAJCOM or equivalent legal review is conducted.
      7.5.10.3. Staff OGD case file to MAJCOM/CC or SAF designee for recommendation
      regarding retirement grade and include statement in that regard.
      7.5.10.4. Forward complete OGD case file to SAFPC (AF/DPG for general officers) and
      provide a copy of transmittal sheet to HQ AFPC/DPPRR (or AF/DPO for colonels and
      colonel selects).
   7.5.11. AF/DPG acts as focal point for all general officer OGDs. Contact AF/DPG,
   Sustainment Division, for specific processing procedures.
      7.5.11.1. Solely the SAF’s discretion will determine the disposition of a general officer
      OGD, with or without the advice and recommendation of SAFPC, as the SAF considers
      appropriate.
   7.5.12. HQ AFPC/DPPRR, AF/DPO for colonels and colonel selects, or AF/DPG for general
   officers) Responsibilities:
      7.5.12.1. Suspend retirement processing (as appropriate).
      7.5.12.2. Monitor OGD actions.
      7.5.12.3. Resume retirement processing upon OGD decision.
      7.5.12.4. Update MilPDS.
      7.5.12.5. Announce OGD decision on behalf of SAFPC.
7.6. General Information On Retired Pay Computation. The Defense Finance Accounting
Service-Cleveland Center (DFAS-CL) computes retired pay under the provisions of the DoD
Financial Management Regulation (FMR) Volume 7B, Military Retired Pay Manual. Questions

or concerns regarding retired pay computation can be sent to DFAS-CL, US Military Retirement
Pay, P. O. Box 7130, London KY 40742-7130. Table 7.1 provides some general rules for
estimating retired pay of members.
7.7. Re-computation of Retired Pay To Show Advancement on the Retired List. An
enlisted member of the Air Force who is advanced to a higher grade according to paragraph 7.4
is entitled to have retired pay re-computed on that advancement (10 USC §8992).
7.8. Re-computation of Retired Pay To Show Later Active Duty. If a retired member later
serves on active duty (other than for training), the member is entitled to have the retired pay re-
computed to include the recall period upon release from that duty. (See 10 USC §1402 &
§1402a.)
7.9. Active Duty Pay Increase. If a member voluntarily retires on the date an active duty pay
increase goes into effect, they are entitled to the new rates for their retired pay. (10 USC §8991
and DoD Financial Management Regulation) The only exceptions to this provision are:
     7.9.1. Officers who meet retirement eligibility (20 years active service) anytime during the
     preceding month of the effective date of retirement may use the new rates in computing their
     retired pay; and
     7.9.2. Regular colonels retiring on the mandatory retirement date established under laws in
     effect before 15 September 1981 if they assumed the grade of colonel prior to 15 Sep 81.
     7.9.3. Officers who apply for and are approved for a voluntary retirement on their post-
     DOPMA mandatory retirement date that falls on the date of an active duty pay increase may
     use the new rates to estimate their retired pay.

NOTES:
1. Date “entered service” means the date the person is enlisted, inducted, or appointed with the
Armed Forces. This includes persons in the Delayed Entry Program (DEP), cadets at Service
academies, officer candidates in Officer Training School (OTS), students enrolled in a Reserve
component in senior Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs or other financial
assistance programs, students in the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and
persons in the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship program. By using “Date entered
service,” active duty members have been “grandfathered” under the plan in effect at the time
when they initially entered the service.
2. The maximum multiplier is 75% times the retired pay base.
3. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act allows state courts to consider retired
pay as divisible property in divorce settlements. The law does not direct state courts to divide
retired pay; it simply permits them to do so.
4. Retired pay stops upon the death of the retiree.
5. Officers who retire and do not meet the requirements to retire in their highest grade (10 USC
§1370) will be paid based on the retired grade. Officers retiring in an enlisted grade will have
their pay calculated as determined by DFAS.
6. Officers who retire and do not meet the requirements to retire in their highest grade (10 USC
§1370) will be paid based on the last 36-month average of the time served in the higher grade
and the time served in the lower grade. EXCEPTION: Does not apply to officers who did not
serve satisfactorily in the highest grade and such determination is the result of conduct occurring
after October 30, 2000.
7. Enlisted members demoted to a lower grade and retired in that grade will not be paid based on
high 36-month average in the higher grades. Their retired pay will be based on “final basic pay”
instead of either the high 36-month average or REDUX formulas. When a regular enlisted
member’s active service added to retired list service totals 30 years, the member may be
advanced (on the retired list) and receive retired pay in the highest grade satisfactorily held on
active duty, as determined by the SAF or designee (10 USC §8964).

         This memo is to inform you that the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF), or designee, will
decide the grade in which you will be retired based upon determination of your satisfactory
service (10 USC §1370). As indicated in AFI 36-3203, paragraph 7.2., if a commissioned officer
is retiring for other than disability or non-regular service, the SAF will determine if the officer
will retire in the highest grade held on active duty satisfactorily for not less than six months.
        Your (misconduct) (substandard performance) (other) resulting in (see note 1) has
prompted this action. The SAF, or designee, will base the decision on a review of your record of
service in your current grade as well as any previously held grade in which misconduct or
substandard performance is alleged (see note 2). The SAF, or designee, will also consider
recommendations made through your chain of command and any comments you wish to provide.
        You may seek the advice of military counsel before responding to this letter. You may
make appropriate, written comments relevant to your grade determination. Your response must
be returned to my office for review and endorsement within 10 calendar days from receipt of this
notification memorandum.
       Should you or your counsel have any questions regarding this matter, you may contact
me at extension _____.

        9.1.2.4. Reserve members on EAD may request a retirement physical examination (see
        Chapter 5).
    9.1.3. Date Retired Pay Begins. The entitlement to retired pay begins on the member’s 60th
    birthday if the requirements of 10 USC §12731 are met. A claim must be filed within 6 years

                                         quotient to three decimal places; and round off to two decimal
                                         places. EXAMPLE: 4734 divided by 360 = 13.150 or 13.15.

                   the product to four decimal places. EXAMPLE: 13.15 x .025
                   = .32875 or .3288.
6                  For members who have a DIEMS/DIEUS date prior to 8 Sep
                   1980, use current active duty basic pay charts at the time
                   granted such pay, determine the monthly active duty basic pay
                   in effect that the member would receive if serving on active
                   duty in their highest temporary or permanent grade
                   satisfactorily held during the entire period of service. Multiply
                   by the product of step 5 to determine monthly retired pay.
                   EXAMPLE: Basic pay $885.00 x .3288 = $290.99, rounded
                   down to $290. (All gross pay is rounded down.)

                                           Chapter 10

  DROPPING RETIRED MILITARY PERSONNEL FROM THE ROLLS OF THE AIR
                              FORCE

10.1. Background Information. This chapter tells how members entitled to military retired
pay are dropped from the rolls of the Air Force under 10 USC §1161(b) when their retired pay is
forfeited under 5 USC, chapter 83, subchapter II. It implements Department of Defense (DoD)
Directive 1332.16, Dropping Retired Military Personnel from the Rolls of the Armed Forces.
10.2. DoD Policy. When retired military members are deprived of their retired pay (5 USC,
chapter 83, subchapter II), DoD policy dictates that they be dropped from the rolls of the military
department. DoD views retired pay as earned and should be withheld only under extremely
limited circumstances. Members must be treated uniformly under substantially similar
circumstances, regardless of their military component.
10.3. General Procedures. When a member is deprived of retired pay under the conditions set
forth in 5 USC, chapter 83, subchapter II, the office of Retired Pay Operations, DFAS-CL sends
the following information and documentation to HQ AFPC, Directorate of Personnel Program
Management (HQ AFPC/ DPP), Randolph AFB TX 78150-4713:
   10.3.1. Member's grade, name and social security number.
   10.3.2. Date of retirement.
   10.3.3. Offense(s) involved, sentence received, and date (finally) sentenced.
   10.3.4. A copy of the court order or judgment certified or otherwise properly authenticated.
   10.3.5. Any other available pertinent data.
10.4. Recommendations. HQ AFPC, Directorate of Personnel Program Management,
Retirements & Separations Division (HQ AFPC/DPPR) assembles and sends all records in the
case, including documents listed in para 10.3 above, to SAFPC.
   10.4.1. SAFPC forwards the package, including the recommendation of the SAF or
   designee, to the Office of the Secretary of Defense for presentation to the President according
   to DoDI 1320.4, Military Officer Actions Requiring Approval of the Secretary of Defense or
   President, or Confirmation by the Senate.
   10.4.2. When the final decision is made to drop the member from the rolls of the Air Force,
   HQ AFPC/DPPR notifies DFAS-CL, HQ AFPC/DPSFCM, and the member.
10.5. Processing Orders. For retired members dropped from the rolls of the Air Force, SAFPC
instructs HQ AFPC/DPPR to publish the orders. The member does not receive any type of
military certification of separation, discharge, or retirement.

Terms
Active Duty—Means full-time duty in the active military service of the United States. Such term
includes full-time training duty, annual training duty, and attendance, while in the active military
service, as a school designated as a service school by law or by the Secretary of the military
department concerned. Such term does not include full-time National Guard duty. (10 USC
§101(d)(1))
Active Duty for Training (ADT)—A tour of active duty used for training members of the
Reserve Components to provide trained units and qualified persons to fill the needs of the Armed
Forces in time of war or national emergency and other such times as national security requires.
The member is under orders which provide for return to inactive status when the period of active
duty for training is completed. It includes annual training, special tours of active duty for
training, school tours, and the initial duty for training performed by nonprior service enlistees.
Active Military Service—A general term that includes Regular officers on the active duty list,
Regular Airmen, and Reserve Component members serving on extended active duty.
Active Status—Means the status of a member of a reserve component who is not in the inactive
Army National Guard or inactive Air National Guard, on an inactive status list, or in the Retired
Reserve. (10 USC §101(d)(4))
Best Interest of the Air Force—A significant situation or circumstance, as determined by the
member’s commander or other senior official, adversely affecting the unit or Air Force mission
if the member’s request for waiver is not approved for retirement restriction, withdrawal or
extension.
Commander—Unless otherwise specified, refers to the immediate commander of the member
concerned, and includes squadron section commanders if they have been appointed in special
orders.
Commissioned Officer—A member of the Air Force having grade of second lieutenant or
above.
Date of Appointment—Date the officer accepted appointment in any component of the Air
Force or in the Air Force without a component.
Dual Status—Regular Airmen who hold Reserve appointments as commissioned officers.
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                   95


Extended Active Duty (EAD)—A tour of active duty (normally for more than 90 days)
performed by a member of the Air Reserve Components (ARC). Strength accountability for
persons on extended active duty changes from the ARC to the active force. Active duty for
training (ADT) and active duty in a service academy or armed forces preparatory school are not
creditable as extended active duty.
Hardship—A fully-documented situation or circumstance that imposes undue privation or
suffering on the member, household, or immediate family that has occurred since the member
applied for retirement. Circumstances common among retirement-eligible members are not
hardships, such as employment prospects or school year considerations. This term does not relate
to humanitarian deferment policies in AFI 36-2110, Assignments, but only to retirement
restrictions identified in Table 2.2 that can be waived for hardship reasons, to withdraw or
extend retirement, or HYT request.
Inactive Duty Training—Authorized training performed by a member of a Reserve component
not on active duty, annual training, or active duty for training. Consists of regularly-scheduled

                             PREAPPLICATION CHECKLIST

The Military Personnel Flight (MPF) attaches a signed copy of this checklist to the AF IMT 1160
and files it in Section 3 of the UPRG as a permanent document.
A7.1. GENERAL EFFECTS OF RETIREMENT APPLICATION. I understand that by
applying for retirement, I:
   A7.1.1. Remain eligible for assignment or training prior to my requested or approved
   retirement date.
   A7.1.2. May not incur a voluntary service commitment beyond my approved retirement date
   unless my request for retirement withdrawal or change in retirement date is approved.
   A7.1.3. Do not have to fulfill an involuntary service commitment beyond an approved
   retirement date, except in unusual circumstances.
   A7.1.4. May be ineligible to reenlist.
   A7.1.5. May have to reimburse the Government for an active duty service commitment
   (ADSC) that I have not yet served because I participated in an Advanced Education
   Assistance program.
A7.2. EFFECTS OF RETIREMENT APPLICATION ON PROMOTION ELIGIBILITY.
   A7.2.1. If stationed overseas, I am ineligible for promotion if I apply for retirement on or
   after the 25th day of the 8th month prior to my date eligible to return from overseas (DEROS).
   Technical Sergeants (TSgt), Master Sergeants (MSgt), and Senior Master Sergeants (SMSgt)
   remain eligible for promotion consideration (see AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion Program)
   if they have a retirement date based on high year of tenure (HYT) that is effective on the first
   day of the month that promotion incrementing starts.
A7.3. TERMINAL LEAVE (AFI 36-3003) If I plan to request leave in connection with
retirement (Terminal Leave), I understand that:
   A7.3.1. I must allow at least 4 months, including terminal leave and permissive temporary
   duty (PTDY), for processing my application and issuing orders. (EXAMPLE: If my
   requested retirement date is 1 July, and I want 30 days of terminal leave and 20 days PTDY, I
   submit my application no later than 11 Jan.) Otherwise, I might not receive retirement orders
   before the date I am scheduled to depart on terminal leave.
   A7.3.2. My commander must authorize terminal leave. Approval is not automatic.
   A7.3.3. I may not request a retirement extension nor withdraw my application solely to take
   terminal leave.
A7.4. RETIREMENT UNDER THE 7-DAY OPTION (AFI 36-3203), paragraph 2. 19.
and AFI 36-2110).
   A7.4.1. If I want to retire in lieu of assignment under the assignment declination or 7-day
   option (7DO) program, I must apply for a retirement date within the time period specified in
   the above referenced instructions. If I am an enlisted member who applies for retirement or
   decline to extend or reenlist to obtain service retainability for controlled duty or permanent
104                                                         AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


   change of station (7DO), I am ineligible for promotion in accordance with AFI 36-2502,
   Airman Promotion Program.
A7.5. WITHDRAWAL OF APPROVED RETIREMENT OR EXTENSION OF
RETIREMENT DATE (AFI 36-3203, paragraphs 2.22 and 5.7). After my requested
retirement date has been approved:
   A7.5.1. I may request to withdraw my retirement application or request an extension of the
   effective date of retirement only for these reasons:
      A7.5.1.1. Hardship—A fully-documented situation or circumstance that imposes undue
      privation or suffering on the member, household, or immediate family that has occurred
      since I applied for retirement. Circumstances common among retirement-eligible
      members are not hardships, such as employment prospects or school year considerations.
      This term does not relate to humanitarian deferment policies in AFI 36-2110,
      Assignments, but only to retirement restrictions identified in Table 2.2 that can be waived
      for hardship reasons, to withdraw or extend retirement, or HYT request.
      A7.5.1.2. Best Interest of the Air Force—A significant situation or circumstance, as
      determined by the member’s commander or other senior official, adversely affecting the
      unit or Air Force mission if the member’s request for waiver is not approved for
      retirement restriction, withdrawal or extension.
      A7.5.1.3. To accept an active duty promotion for which I was selected and of which I
      was notified after I applied for retirement.
   A7.5.2. Normally, I will not be allowed to request withdrawal of my retirement if I applied
   for retirement under the assignment declination or 7DO program.
   A7.5.3. I can expect to retire on the approved date unless I am placed on medical hold by
   HQ AFPC/ DPAMM or if my retirement is suspended. Only if HQ AFPC/DPPRR (AF/DPE
   for CMSgts, or AF/ DPO for colonels and colonel selectees) rescinds my orders before my
   retirement effective date can I be carried past my original retirement date.
   A7.5.4. I may not request extension or withdrawal of an approved retirement to receive
   promotion consideration during a upcoming cycle.
   A7.5.5. (Regular Officers/Below the Grade of Lt Col) I can expect to retire on my
   approved voluntary retirement date unless non-selected for promotion a second time. If I am
   non-selected for promotion a second time, the law states that I must retire no later than my
   mandatory separation date (MSD), regardless of whether my voluntary retirement was
   approved for a date after my MSD, unless I am selected for continuation. I may request a
   voluntary retirement for a date on or before my MSD.
A7.6. EXTENSION OF DATE OF SEPARATION (DOS) TO RETIRE COINCIDENT
WITH HIGH YEAR OF TENURE (HYT) DATE.
   A7.6.1. If I am an enlisted member and my DOS comes prior to my HYT date for my grade,
   I may request a 1-month extension in order to retire on the 1st day of the month following the
   month in which my HYT date occurs.
AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                     105


A7.7. UNDERSTANDING OF RETIRED PAY COMPUTATION (AFI 36-3203, Chapter
7). I received counseling on how my retired pay is affected by my proposed retirement date and
have been given a retired pay estimate.
   A7.7.1. DFAS-CL computes retired pay according to my grade, 10 USC §1405 service, and
   the date I initially entered uniformed service (DIEUS).
   A7.7.2. Longevity increases based upon my pay date affect my retired pay. Military
   members are paid a specific amount of basic pay past any longevity increase established
   within each pay grade. To receive active duty and retired pay at any longevity increase point,
   I must complete the full numbers of years of service, plus one day, from my pay date.
   EXAMPLE: To be paid at the higher, over 22-year rate as a military retiree, a member must
   complete at least 22 years plus one day from their pay date. If a member has not served one
   day of active duty beyond exactly 22 years from their pay date, DFAS-CL will compute
   retired pay on the next lower longevity increase of the pay table for the retired grade; in this
   example, the lower, over-20 rate.
   A7.7.3. Service computed under 10 USC §1405 determines my retired pay
   multiplier. Each additional month of my service in excess of full years will be credited at
   1/12 of 2 ½ % (3 ½ % if retiring under the CSB/REDUX option) for each additional month I
   served. I understand my §1405 service is the same as my service for basic pay unless I had a
   break in active service or performed inactive Reserve service after 1 June 1958 (when 10
   USC §1405 was enacted). Service that is creditable under §1405 is shown in AFI 36-2604,
   Service Dates and Dates of Rank.
NOTE:_ Officer/Airman Service Verification Section (HQ AFPC/DPPAOR) computes §1405
service dates for all retirement eligible officers/enlisted personnel using master personnel records
then enters them into MilPDS where base level personnel are able to retrieve these dates.
   A7.7.4. If my retirement date is effective on the same date as an active duty pay raise, my
   retired pay will be computed at the higher, new pay rate. The only exceptions to this are: (1)
   Officers who do not request voluntary retirement on their mandatory separation date (MSD);
   and (2) Regular colonels who assumed the grade of colonel prior to 15 September 1981 who
   retire on their mandatory retirement date. (See DoD Financial Management Regulation,
   paragraph 10402 and Table 1-7 for details).
   A7.7.5. I have read the general information concerning how my retired pay will be
   calculated. I understand that, once I have requested a retirement date, I may not extend that
   date or withdraw my application for the sole purpose of increasing my retired pay.
   A7.7.6. I understand that, if I have received separation, severance or readjustment pay under
   any provision of law for service in the armed forces and, if I later qualify for retired pay,
   DFAS-CL will recoup the total amount of separation, severance or readjustment pay from my
   retired pay.
A7.8. RECEIPT OF RETIREMENT ORDERS.
   A7.8.1. If my retirement application is approved and I am within 1 year of retirement, I
   should receive retirement orders within 60 days from the date the MPF receives notice of the
   approval provided the 10 USC §1405 service date has been calculated.
106                                                        AFI36-3203 8 SEPTEMBER 2006


   A7.8.2. I must complete all Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) actions with the SBP counselor by
   finalizing the DD Form 2656, Data for Payment of Retired Personnel, before being
   permitted to depart on terminal leave or finalize outprocessing.
A7.9. RECALL TO ACTIVE DUTY AFTER RETIREMENT.
   A7.9.1. I understand that if I am a retired Regular member, or a member of the Retired
   Reserve who has retired under 10 USC §8911 or 8914, the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF)
   may order me to active duty at any time after I retire (10 USC §688). If I am a member of the
   Retired Reserve and have not completed 20 years of active service, the SAF will not recall
   me involuntarily unless the SAF determines that not enough qualified Reserves are readily
   available to supply the needed skills (10 USC §12301 thru 12305.)
   ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF UNDERSTANDING.
   I have been advised of the effects of my retirement application and have been given guidance
   on who to contact for further information regarding my retirement.

     SAMPLE LETTER FOR NOTIFYING AIR RESERVE MEMBERS OF THEIR
               ELIGIBILITY FOR RETIRED PAY AT AGE 60

(Date)
HQ ARPC/DPPR
6760 E. Irvington PL #1900
Denver CO 80280-1900
(Members Address)
Dear (Member)
This letter notifies you that, having completed the required years of service under the provisions
of Title 10, United States Code (USC), §12731, you will be entitled to retired pay at age 60 upon
your application. The Air Force may not deny or revoke your eligibility for retired pay on the
basis of any error, unless it resulted directly from fraud or misrepresentation on your part.
However, the Air Force may adjust the number of years of creditable service and retirement
points upon which retired pay is computed to correct any error. If such a correction is made, you
will be eligible for retired pay in accordance with the number of years of creditable service, as
corrected, from the date that retired pay is granted.
This letter also serves as notification that you are eligible to participate in the Reserve
Component Survivor Benefit Plan (RCSBP). This plan permits you to provide a monthly annuity
to your designated beneficiaries in the event of your death. The options available are: Option A
(defer coverage to age 60); Option B (annuity to begin on the date you would have reached age
60); and Option C (immediate annuity). Within 30 days you should receive detailed information
on RCSBP by certified mail. If you do not receive the RCSBP package or if you have questions
regarding it, contact the Entitlements Branch, ARPC/ DPSPE, DSN 926-6576 or toll free at 1-
800-525-0102. If you live in the Denver Metro Area, call 676-6576.
In the event you are now or later become entitled, under any other provision of law, to retired
pay from an Armed Force or as a member of the Fleet Reserve or Fleet Marine Corps Reserve,
you will not be entitled to retired pay under the provisions of 10 USC §12731, nor would you be
eligible for the coverage provided under the RCSBP.
As of (date), our records show that you have accrued (#) points for retired pay. Points you
subsequently accrue before age 60 will also be credited to the maximum allowed.
Sincerely
Military Personnel Technician
