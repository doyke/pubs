                                        Pre-complaint (Informal) Process
    •    The aggrieved person contacts the EO Office at 612-713-1075 for information on the EO process,
         Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), and other possible options available in resolving their
         concern. An EO counselor is assigned to process informal complaints. ADR Mediators are
         volunteers that have been trained in ADR techniques. Neither Counselors nor Mediators are
         advocates for management or the complainant, but serve as an impartial third party.
    •    Counselors seek resolution through informal fact-finding inquiries into the discrimination claim.
         The counselor’s inquiry includes talking with individual(s) alleged to have discriminated and
         witnesses with possible knowledge of the complaint issues. The Mediator seeks resolution
         through a formal mediation with the parties involved in the claim.
    •    If resolution is not reached through counseling or ADR, the employee receives a notice, including
         their rights, to file a formal complaint if desired.
    •    The EO Office does not make discrimination findings or decide whether or not complaints have
         merit.

                                         Formal Complaint Process
    •    Within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notice of right to file, a formal written complaint can be
         filed with the 934th Airlift Wing EO Office.
    •    Accepted claims and amendments to the claim will be investigated by DoD Investigations and
         Resolutions Division (IRD).
    •    Dismissals can be appealed to EEOC.
    •    IRD provides a report of investigation with an analysis of the complaint.
    •    The complainant can request a hearing by an EEOC Administrative Judge or a final Air Force
         decision.
    •    The Administrative Judge or the Agency will issue a final decision, which can be appealed to
         EEOC.
    •    After appeals are exhausted, the complainant can file a civil action.
