                                            Chapter 1

                                           GENERAL

1.1. Deviation and Waiver Authority. Deviations from the procedures in this regulation are
not authorized except for safety of flight considerations. Report all deviations to 354th
Operations Group Commander (354 OG/CC). Deviation or waiver requests to this instruction
need to be submitted on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication (Flight
Publications), to the 354th Operations Group Standardization and Evaluation (OG/OGV). The
354 OG/CC, or a designated representative, must approve requests before flight operations
begin.
1.2. TDY Operations. Units deployed to PAEI for local flying must have an Eielson host unit.
TDY aircrews attending DISTANT FRONTIER, RED FLAG-Alaska, NORTHERN EDGE
and/or flying with host unit are considered local aircrew. Deployed aircrews will receive a local
area briefing from a local host unit covering PAEI procedures. Deployed unit commanders will
inform their host unit of additional training requirements and events prior to the normal planning
and scheduling cycle. This is especially important when the training event will extend the
planned flying window. The Eielson host unit will provide a 354 FW In-flight Guide (IFG) to all
aircrews. Electronic and hard copies of the IFG are available from 354 OG/OGV, DSN 317-
377-1801. TDY units wishing to participate in reduced same runway separation (RSRS) will
sign a letter of agreement. TDY units can obtain a copy of the RSRS LOA from 354
OSS/OSAT.
   1.2.1. All 354 FW pilots, when TDY, will comply with the local operating procedures
   published by the host unit. Where local procedures are not published, or deemed
   inappropriate, the deployed commander will develop appropriate procedures for the deployed
   location, following the guidance in this supplement to the maximum extent possible. The
   deployed commander will gain approval from the 354 OG/CC and host OG/CC (if
   applicable) prior to implementation.
1.3. Off Station Training, Aircraft Deliveries, Diverts, and Ferry Flights. When planning
and accomplishing these missions, pilots will comply with the cross-country checklist in the 354
FW IFG and AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, with appropriate supplements. Consult the
Alaska Enroute Supplement when anticipating operations in or near the Air Defense
Identification Zone (ADIZ) or Buffer Zone.
   1.3.1. The pilot will ensure:
       1.3.1.1. Maintenance requirements including pre-flight, through-flight, and post-flight
       are accomplished at each stopover, whenever possible.
       1.3.1.2. Engine oil samples are taken and read after first flight of the day. If unable to
       read a sample after first flight, the pilot can transport them to the next location.
       1.3.1.3. Adequate supplies of AF Form 15, United States Air Force Invoice, are carried
       in each aircraft to charge supplies or services at other than active Air Force installations.
       1.3.1.4. Adequate aircraft security is provided.
       1.3.1.5. Customs officials are notified of all flights originating outside of the United
       States and recovering in the United States.
 8                                                         354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


        1.3.1.6. Each point of intended landing meets minimum runway length criteria.
     1.3.2. Prior to departure, check with home-station operations to ensure no new go/no-go
     items have been released and inform the 354 FW Command Post (CP), DSN 317-377-1500
     of the estimated takeoff time, time enroute, and point of intended landing.
     1.3.3. After landing, and as soon as possible, notify CP of actual takeoff time, time enroute,
     landing time, aircraft status, and actual aircraft location. This information will be passed by
     the most expeditious means possible.
     1.3.4. When flying is completed for the day, notify CP of all pilots‘ locations, flight leads‘
     phone numbers, and the next day‘s itinerary.
     1.3.5. Deviations from these procedures will be coordinated with the squadron
     commander/operations officer and 354 OG/CC. All changes in destination(s) from the
     planned itinerary require 354 OG/CC approval.
1.4. Command and Control. The 354 OG/CC is responsible for flying operations at PAEI.
     1.4.1. The Supervisor of Flying (SOF) is the direct representative of the 354 OG/CC. The
     SOF supervises flying activities from Eielson Air Traffic Control Tower during 354 FW
     operations when required by AFI 11-418. In addition, the SOF works directly with the
     AIRBOSS and tower Watch Supervisor (WS) to determine Major Flying Exercise (MFE)
     recovery options. NOTE: The SOF shall not attempt to regulate the flow of air traffic nor
     perform any air traffic control function. The SOF may coordinate with the WS to transmit
     critical information to an emergency aircraft over ATC frequencies when the nature of the
     situation warrants and is essential to prevent a mishap.
     1.4.2. The Base Fire Chief (354 CES/CEF) or his designated rep (Chief 2) is the initial on-
     scene commander for ground emergencies and In-Flight Emergencies (IFE) after landing at
     PAEI.
     1.4.3. The Control Tower provides air traffic services to aircraft operating within the Eielson
     Class Delta Airspace.
     1.4.4. The 354 FW Scheduling (354 OSS/OSCR, DSN 317-377-9327) is the scheduling
     authority for special use airspace under the jurisdiction of the Joint Pacific Alaska Range
     Complex (JPARC).
     1.4.5. The Flight Lead (FL) will coordinate any changes to the daily plan through the
     squadron Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup) as soon as conditions permit. This should include
     any of the following: mission profile changes, airspace changes, diversions, callsign
     changes, flight renumbering, and/or tail number changes.
     1.4.6. The SOF will be notified by squadron operations of any flying schedule changes.
     Pilots will notify the SOF, time and conditions permitting, of all emergencies, air aborts,
     diverts, and any significant weather conditions.
     1.4.7. Pilots will contact squadron operations with maintenance code and munitions
     remaining, NLT 10 minutes prior to landing. This call also aids in notifying de-arm
     personnel of impending aircraft arrival.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                      9


1.5. Mission Restrictions.
   1.5.1. Alternate missions must be briefed prior to flight.
   1.5.2. Do not fly practice instrument approaches or overhead patterns with heavyweight
   ordnance (live or inert).
   1.5.3. Single ship fighter sorties (scheduled or fallout) require Ops Sup approval and will be
   IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures and AFI 11-2MDSV3, MDS
   Operations Procedures.
1.6. Environmental Restrictions. IAW 354 FWI 10-229, Responding to Severe Weather
Events, and the following:
   1.6.1. Wind Limits. The wind limits listed below have been established to protect pilots in
   the event of ejection. The waiver authority for the listed limitations is the 354 OG/CC. Pilot
   judgment must be used in remote areas where there are virtually no ground reporting stations
   to assess current wind/sea state. Special consideration should be given to wind effects on
   surface temperature and establishment of Equivalent Chill Temperature (ECT). The Weather
   Flight (354 OSS/OSW) is responsible for determining and reporting the ECT.
       1.6.1.1. Over Land. When the actual steady-state surface winds at PAEI exceed 35 knots,
       all local flying training will terminate and airborne aircraft will be recalled or diverted. If
       individual operating areas have a steady state surface wind speed in excess of 35 knots,
       they are off limits for training; however, other training areas may be used.
       1.6.1.2. Over Water. When the actual, over water, steady state surface winds exceed 25
       knots or wave heights exceed 10 feet, the affected area will be off limits for training
       flights.
   1.6.2. Cold Weather Operations (CWO) General Procedures.
       1.6.2.1. CWO will normally be initiated from 15 October to 15 April, or as deemed
       necessary by 354 OG/CC.
       1.6.2.2. At ECT -40°F or colder as reported by Eielson AFB weather services, the 354
       OG/CC and 354 MXG/CC will determine if aircraft launch and outside maintenance
       activities will be conducted. If ground operations are suspended, airborne aircraft may
       continue with planned mission, but will return with enough fuel to hold for slower than
       normal recovery operations.
          1.6.2.2.1. At ECT -50°F or colder, the 354 FW/CC will determine if aircraft launch
          and outside maintenance activities will be conducted.
          1.6.2.2.2. The 354 OG/CC will determine if flying training is permitted in intended
          Special Use Airspace (SUA)/Military Training Route (MTR) with an observed or
          forecasted ambient temperature between -40°F and -50°F in the next 12 hours. This
          decision will be based on, but not limited to, temperature data from various sites,
          predicted ECTs and known operating procedures of personnel recovery forces.
          1.6.2.2.3. At -50°F ambient and below reported in intended airspace, the 354 FW/CC
          will determine if flying training will be conducted.
10                                                     354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


        1.6.2.2.4. Aircraft will not conduct flying training over any SUA/MTR that has been
        deemed unsuitable; but may transit enroute to approved airspace or during RTB.
     1.6.2.3. Any time the PAEI Runway Condition Rating (RCR) is ≤ 12, the 354 FW SOF
     will declare a suitable IFR alternate.
     1.6.2.4. During cold weather operations, single-ship fighter sorties are not authorized
     north of the Yukon River or south of the Alaska Range.
     1.6.2.5. Cold Weather Operations Procedures Prior to Taxi.
        1.6.2.5.1. IAW AFI 21-101_354FWSUP, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance
        Management, hangar door operation will be as follows:
            1.6.2.5.1.1. When outside air temperatures are between 0 and 32 F, bay doors
            may only remain open for 30 minutes. If the temperature is at or below 0 F, then
            bay doors may only remain open for 15 minutes.
            1.6.2.5.1.2. While in the bay and a RED BALL is required that will exceed bay
            door time limits, relocate to Alpha, Baker, or Charlie Rows or EOR if safe taxi
            can be accomplished. If a system prohibits safe taxi notify the Pro Super ASAP
            and be prepared to shut down to prevent having the bay doors open too long.
            1.6.2.5.1.3. Ice FOD Alert Procedures. Reference 354 FW IFG. Base weather
            will normally determine if ice FOD potential exists. If icing is encountered, on
            the ground or in the air, follow Technical Order guidance and make an info entry
            on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, if
            applicable.
     1.6.2.6. Cold Weather Operations Taxi Procedures.
        1.6.2.6.1. Taxi spacing is 300 feet. Staggered taxi is not authorized.
        1.6.2.6.2. If taxi lines are not visible due to snow/ice, taxi is prohibited. Stop the
        aircraft and advise both ground control and the SOF.
        1.6.2.6.3. Taxi spacing is 500 feet when sand is present.
        1.6.2.6.4. The minimum RCR to taxi on a designated surface is 6.
        1.6.2.6.5. The maximum taxi speed is equivalent to the RCR for that surface. As an
        example, when the RCR on Taxiway F is 10, the maximum taxi speed on Taxiway F
        is 10 knots. When the RCR is <12, slow the aircraft to nearly a complete stop prior to
        turning.
        1.6.2.6.6. If there are questionable/unknown RCRs in an area, or where RCRs differ
        significantly from what was briefed, notify the SOF. If conditions are deemed too
        poor to continue taxi, stop the aircraft and notify Ground Control (GC) and the SOF.
        1.6.2.6.7. Aircraft will not turn inside of another aircraft holding in an adjacent spot.
        Instead, proceed to the next available spot to the outside of the aircraft. However,
        turning inside of an aircraft is permitted when the adjacent parking spot between
        parking aircraft and parked aircraft is empty and the parking aircraft comes to a full
        stop prior to executing the turn into the spot. Also, if ramp space allows turning well
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               11


           aft of the adjacent aircraft, allowing a straight taxi into the spot; pilots may use
           adjacent spots.
       1.6.2.7. Cold Weather Operations Takeoff Procedures.
           1.6.2.7.1. Static run-up for takeoff will not be performed.      Single-ship rolling
           takeoffs will be used.
           1.6.2.7.2. The cleared runway (RWY) surface area may be of sufficient width to
           allow only one aircraft to be on the RWY at a time.
           1.6.2.7.3. Minimum takeoff interval will be 20 seconds. When sand is present on the
           RWY increase minimum takeoff interval to 30 seconds to minimize damage from
           airborne sand and permit a clear view of the preceding aircraft.
           1.6.2.7.4. Formation takeoffs/landings are not authorized until snow removal clears
           the entire RWY and the 354 OG/CC grants specific approval.
           1.6.2.7.5. Caution must be taken not to exceed the gear extended airspeed limits
           during periods of extreme cold. Gear is slow to retract and acceleration is markedly
           increased.
       1.6.2.8. Cold Weather Operations Landing Procedures. Reference Attachment 8
       REDUCED SAME RUNWAY SEPARATION. If taxiing clear of the RWY and taxi
       lines are obscured due to snow, taxi only enough to clear the RWY, then hold your
       position and advise the SOF.
1.7. Airfield and ATC Services. PAEI airfield and ATC services are available 24 hours a day,
7 days a week. Airfield management, air traffic control and weather services are attended from
0700-2300 daily, unless NOTAM‘ed otherwise. The 354 OG/CC authorizes the use of on-call
procedures between the hours of 2300-0700L. Flying operations during these times require 354
OG/CC approval. Airfield management (AMOPS), air traffic control and weather services
maintain a 30-minute response when facilities are not attended.
1.8. Weather Briefings. A weather briefing is required before each flight. For local training
missions, optimum weather support is via face-to-face support during the mission planning and
mass briefing process. FL/pilots will receive current observation and forecast for entire flying
window at PAEI and designated alternate airfields. Ceiling, visibility, EO/IR TDA, available
night illumination for NVG operations (when appropriate), civil twilight times, minimum ECT,
and forecast winds are required for local MOA/ATCAA/LATN training.
1.9. Transient Aircraft. PAEI requires a prior permission required (PPR) number for all
transient aircraft. During Major Force Exercises MFEs and when the 354 OG/CC deems it
necessary, the airfield will be Official Business Only (OBO). NOTE: PPR restrictions are not
applicable to Air Evacuation, distinguished visitors, or SAM (Special Air Mission) aircraft, nor
do they preclude use of PAEI as an ―alternate‖ for IFR flights.
1.10. Transient Alert. Transient Alert (TA) provides marshalling, de-icing, AGE, and fueling
services. TA does not provide weapons safing. Please refer to the Alaskan Supplement for
specific services provided/available.
1.11. Flight Information Publication (FLIP). AMOPS is the base FLIP manager, and is
responsible for updating and maintaining all non-procedural FLIP information. AMOPS,
 12                                                   354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


18 AGRS, 168 ARW, and 353 CTS each maintain a FLIP account. Each unit‘s FLIP account
manager is responsible for updating their own account information. AMOPS will keep a small
supply of FLIPS for transient aircrews. Base agencies sponsoring TDY units will coordinate
with those unit(s) to ensure adequate FLIPS are available while units are TDY to Eielson.
1.12. Airfield and Restricted Area Photography. Official photography or filming and audio
recordings must be coordinated with Public Affairs (354 FW/PA) and must be for official Air
Force purposes. Unofficial photography or filming and audio recording is restricted. All news
media and 354 FW/PA sponsored tours must be escorted by an authorized representative of the
Public Affairs Office. NOTE: All foreign nationals requesting photography, filming and/or
audio recordings must be escorted by a member of the 354 FW/PA in addition to procedures
above.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                13

2.4. Fairbanks Approach Terminal Radar Service Area (TRSA). The airspace surrounding
PAEI and Fairbanks International Airport wherein ATC provides radar vectoring, sequencing,
and separation on a full-time basis for all IFR and participating VFR aircraft. Pilots operating
under TRSA must follow Fairbanks approach directed vectors and altitudes even when flying
under VFR. TRSA service is optional and will be assumed unless the pilot specifically declines
by stating ―Negative TRSA‖. Pilots are highly encouraged to retain TRSA service with
departure control until approaching the range/MOA boundary, transitioning to low level, or
departing beyond 15 NM of PAEI.
2.5. PAEI Description. PAEI is located approximately 17 miles southeast of Fairbanks, AK at
N64O 39.94‘ W147O 06.09‘. Eielson has a single runway, RWY 32/14. The runway is 14,530
feet long and is 150 feet wide. Construction is grooved concrete on the center 75 feet; asphalt

   2.5.3. Airfield Lighting. Eielson RWY 32/14 has ALSF-1 with sequenced flashing lights
   (SFLs), PAPIs, and high intensity runway lights (HIRLS). Control Tower will operate all
   airfield lights IAW FAA JO 7110.65. NOTE: Runway lighting configuration is non-
   standard. Runway edge lights are 75 feet from the runway centerline for the first 3,200 feet
   of RWY 32. The remaining edge lights are 150 feet from the runway centerline. CAUTION:
   2000 feet of runway edge lights (between Taxiway D and C) are non-standard (12 feet from
   the runway edge).
         2.5.3.1. Lighting intensities may be adjusted when requested by aircrews, AMOPS,
         Snow Removal, or SOF. If the lights are requested to be set lower, they will be returned
         to FAA JO 7110.65 criteria after the requesting party‘s operation is complete.
         2.5.3.2. Tower will notify the weather observer of changes to the runway edge light
         settings and when the HIRLS become inoperative.
         2.5.3.3. If the tower must evacuate, the runway edge lights, taxiway lights, and approach
         lights for the runway in use will be set on the step required at the time based on the
         current weather observation and the FAA JO 7110.65 criteria or step 1. Tower will
         transfer airfield lighting controls over to AMOPS when evacuating.
         2.5.3.4. In the event AMOPS also evacuates, AMOPS will notify Airfield Lighting to
         dispatch personnel to the lighting vault to change light settings while the AMOPS facility
         is evacuated.
         2.5.3.5. During snow removal operations, runway, taxiway, and distance remaining
         marker (DRM) lights will be turned on for snow equipment operators to see and avoid the
         lights.

      2.5.4.2. Snow Control Configuration. At the start of snowfall, freezing rain or sleet,
      AMOPS will coordinate with the SOF and Barrier Maintenance to remove all barriers for
      snow removal operations.
   2.5.5. Drag Chute Jettison. Drag chutes will not be jettisoned on the RWY to the maximum
   extent possible. Aircraft with drag chutes must turn off the RWY at either Taxiway A or E
   so as not to drag the chute through the infield or snag taxiway lights with the drag chute. If
   aircrew must jettison a drag chute, they will notify the Tower of the chute‘s location. The
   Tower will forward the information to AMOPS and/or Transient Alert for recovery. Visiting
   units participating in RED FLAG-Alaska, DISTANT FRONTIER, etc. and using drag chutes
   will coordinate drag chute jettison procedures through the 353d Combat Training Squadron
   (353 CTS).

  Pilots must also adhere to the following procedures during lights-out operations in these
  areas.
     2.7.2.1. A lights-out training NOTAM must be published at least 48 hours in advance.
     Squadron Ops Sup will check that the NOTAM has been issued and will brief the status
     and effective times during the mass brief.
     2.7.2.2. Flight leads must coordinate with the RMA before the mission to establish a
     common working frequency and ensure manning is available to control or monitor the
     flight.
     2.7.2.3. Flight lead will notify ANC Center of intended ―lights-out operations‖ and
     designated RMA for the mission when requesting airspace clearance.
     2.7.2.4. Flight lead will notify range control of intended ―lights-out operations‖ upon

     2.7.2.5. If a discrete IFF Mode 3 is assigned to each aircraft in the flight, then aircraft
     will squawk ATC-assigned Mode 3/C.
     2.7.2.6. If a discrete IFF Mode 3 is not assigned to each aircraft, then the lead aircraft
     will squawk ATC-assigned Mode 3/C while other flight members squawk Mode 3
     4000/C or mission planned/assigned tactical IFF Mode 3 squawk.
     2.7.2.7. Flight lead must establish contact with the RMA when airborne.
     2.7.2.8. All aircraft must monitor coordinated common frequency and UHF Guard.
  2.7.3. ATCAA/MOA lights-out operations will be terminated under any of the following
  conditions:
     2.7.3.1. If notified by ANC Center, the RMA, or any competent authority that a non-
     participating aircraft is determined to pose a threat of conflict or collision risk.
     2.7.3.2. Radar or radio communication is lost with the RMA.
     2.7.3.3. If an aircraft spills out of designated airspace, then it will immediately terminate
     lights-out operations until reestablished within boundaries.
     2.7.3.4. Participating aircraft is NORDO.
     2.7.3.5. Before leaving the designated airspace for RTB.
     2.7.3.6. Anytime requested by ANC Center.
  2.7.4. RMA scheduling and use. Baron is scheduled as the default RMA for lights-out
  operations. Flight leads must coordinate with Baron before the mission to ensure controller
  availability. If AWACS is used as the RMA, squadron scheduling must have it listed next to
  the flight‘s remarks on the wing schedule NLT 1400 the day prior. The JSO will submit the
  printed schedule to ANC Center daily. When AWACS is the RMA, minimum altitude will
  be coordinated between the Senior Director and flight lead. All players will acknowledge the
  minimum altitude for lights-out operations.
  2.7.5. 354 OSS/OSCR will notify AMOPS and TOP ROCC 72 hours prior to lights-out
  operations. AMOPS will issue a local NOTAM and notify Fairbanks FSS to issue a civilian
  NOTAM. Contact 354 OG/OGV if a NOTAM is not issued.

2.8. Minimum IFR and Safe Altitude (MIA and MSA) Calculations. MIA and MSA will be
calculated IAW AFI 11-202V3. The majority of Alaska and the JPARC is considered
mountainous terrain IAW Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 95.17. Therefore, when
off airways and IFR/IMC all pilots will fly no lower than 2000 feet above all obstacles within 5
nautical miles of the course to be flown. The local PAEI non-mountainous airspace exceptions
are R-2211 and within 3 nautical miles of PAEI. Reference 14 CFR 95.17 for Alaska non-
mountainous terrain latitude/longitude coordinates. In addition, Alaska temperatures at altitude
are typically 10°C below ISA. When applicable, pilots will add 1000 feet to MIA and MSA

   either UHF or VHF radios.
   3.8.8. Aircraft with a wingspan greater than 190 feet are prohibited on Taxiway F between
   Taxiway B and C (Tanker Row) without wing walkers.
   3.8.9. Taxiing an aircraft with < 25‘ wing tip spacing (15‘ in areas clearly marked with taxi
   lines and clear of FOD and equipment) requires a wing walker. Taxiing with less than 10‘
   wing tip spacing is prohibited unless entering/exiting a specifically designated/marked spot
   under the supervision of a marshaller. The 8-bay, 4-bay, and Hawg Pens are approved taxi
   locations with less than 10‘ of wingtip clearance if a marshaller and wingtip monitors are in
   place.
   3.8.10. Arriving/Departing helicopters must not overfly aircraft.
   3.8.11. B-52 Operations. B-52s will not taxi on Taxiways B or D due to wing tip wheel
   interference with taxiway lighting and runway signage. Unless the runway edge lights are
   removed, B-52 aircraft shall not use the south 3,200 feet of the RWY due to wing tip wheel
   interference. Due to wingtip restrictions, B-52s should not use Taxiway F north of Tanker
   Row or south of Taxiway C. NOTE: During extended B-52 operations, AMOPS will have
   Airfield Lighting remove the south 3,200 feet of runway edge lights.

   3.9.1. 18 AGRS F-16s may arm on Charlie Row and taxi to the RWY, regardless of RWY in
   use. 18 AGRS may use spots 1-6 on Taxiway E for pre-takeoff inspections. 18 AGRS may
   de-arm/safe the jet on Taxiway C prior to taxiing to park.
   3.9.2. When RWY 32 is in use, exercise aircraft loaded with CATMs, and defensive,
   internally mounted chaff and flares will perform arming on Taxiway G (primary) or Taxiway
   E (alternate). Exercise aircraft will de-arm at Taxiway A (primary) or Romeo and Quebec
   Rows (alternates). Use of the alternate de-arm areas requires prior approval from the Airfield
   Manager, Weapons Safety Manager and MXG/CC. When authorized to use the alternate de-
   arm areas, exercise aircraft loaded with CATMs, and defensive, internally mounted chaff and
   flares may exit the runway at Taxiway B.
      3.9.2.1. Taxiway A de-arming. Aircraft will use the northern arming/de-arming
      locations. If spots are full, continue taxi to Taxiway F and execute 180° turn to reenter
      the southern side of Taxiway A from the east. Take the first spot available (easternmost)
      to hold and await an open arming spot on the northern side.
   3.9.3. When RWY 14 is in use, exercise aircraft loaded with CATMs, and defensive,
   internally mounted chaff and flares will perform arming on Taxiway A (primary) or Romeo
   and Quebec Rows (alternates). Use of the alternate arming areas requires prior approval from
   the Airfield Manager, Weapons Safety Manager and MXG/CC. Exercise aircraft will de-arm
   location at Taxiway G (primary) with Taxiway E as alternate.

   accomplish pre-takeoff/post landing checks in the chocks.
   3.9.5. Check appropriate armament switches safe and keep both hands in view during
   ground crew arming/de-arming procedures. Intercom communications with ground crew will
   be used to the maximum extent possible.
   3.9.6. Individual flight members should clear the EOR after arming is complete.
   3.9.7. All personnel will comply with arm safe procedures (EOR) as described in AFI 21-
   101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, related supplements, TOs, and this
   instruction. See Attachment 17 for Ground Maintenance Personnel End of Runway (EOR)
   Weapons Arming/Dearming Procedures.
      3.9.7.1. EOR inspections and/or arming and safing of deployed aircraft will be
      performed by deployed maintenance personnel.
   3.9.8. All aircraft with expendable ordnance or chaff/flares will go through de-arm. Aircraft
   that require safing will be safed and pinned at a designated EOR, unless prior approval has
   been coordinated, before taxiing to parking. If EOR crews are not available (for example,
   RWY change in effect) and a low fuel state exists, contact the SOF and shut down the
   engines in the appropriate EOR area, if necessary.
3.10. RED FLAG-Alaska/Major Flying Exercises (MFE) Taxi Procedures. The following

          Papa/Quebec, Romeo/Sierra, Tanker Row, and the South Ramp. NOTE: Heavies
          may only perform idle engine runs on Oscar Row.
          3.13.3.2.2. Bomber aircraft requiring max power engine runs will be positioned on
          Taxiway G, heading in such a way as their jet blast will not affect other aircraft
          operations or create a FOD hazard.
   3.13.4. Small aircraft (prop driven or jet) may perform 100% engine runs at the standard
   parking spot.
   3.13.5. MOCC shall advise GC of proposed maintenance engine runs (this is an advisory
   only; Control Tower does not approve or deny maintenance engine runs).
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               33


   3.13.6. Tower may terminate any engine run that causes ice fog which restricts RWY
   visibility.
3.14. Aircraft Tow Procedures. Aircraft movement is authorized without GC approval only on
the Loop Taxiway, parking Rows Alpha through Delta (in front of the 8-bay/4-bay), and in
between and around the Hangars 1227 & 1228. MOC will forward all tow requests outside of
the Loop Taxiway to AMOPS (377-1861). AMOPS will inform the Tower of all tow requests.
Tow crews shall obtain tower approval prior to commencing tow. Tow crews will monitor Ramp
Net during all tow operations even if not entering the CMA.
3.15. Snow Removal Operations. Airfield snow removal operations will be IAW 354 FWI 32-
1003, Snow and Ice Control Plan. When the RCR is less than 12 and/or deteriorating conditions
warrant, snow and ice removal operations will take precedence over flying operations.
   3.15.1. 354 FW flying ops. The SOF will coordinate with the Airfield Manager to determine
   the priority of snow removal operations. Flights will be limited to restricted low approaches
   when snow and ice removal operations are in progress on the RWY.
   3.15.2. Snow Effects on ILS. Tower will advise Airfield Systems personnel when system
   anomalies are reported by pilots on final. ATCALS will advise Tower and AMOPS when
   snow accumulation or drifting on the airfield impacts system reliability. The system will be
   removed from service when advised by ATCALS that accumulation exceeded the technical
   limits. The 354 OG/CC determines if an operational check and/or special flight inspection is
   required before returning the system to service.

                                   FLIGHT OPERATIONS

4.1. Runway Selection.
   4.1.1. The ATC watch supervisor will use the criteria outlined below to determine the
   runway in use, but may, in the interest of safety and/or to maintain an expeditious and
   orderly flow of traffic, deviate from this criteria.
   4.1.2. When the tailwind component is 10 knots or less, RWY 32 will be the runway in use.
   4.1.3. When the crosswind component exceeds 10 knots, the RWY most nearly aligned with
   the wind will be in use.
   4.1.4. When the ceiling and/or visibility are below published circling minimums, wind
   direction and speed will not be the sole determining factor for choosing the RWY in use.
   Due to snow operations some areas on the RWY may not be cleared, and RWY use may be
   determined by cleared areas on the airfield.
   4.1.5. Tower shall notify FAI ATCT, AMOPS, the weather observer, and the SOF (if on
   duty) prior to changing the RWY in use.
4.2. Radio Procedures. All aircraft under the operational control of the 354 FW should use
standardized preset channels 2 through 13. In addition, utilize UHF frequencies to the max
extent especially in the tower pattern.       See Attachment 14 PAEI FREQUENCY
CHANNELIZATION.
4.3. Standard and Nonstandard Formations. All fixed wing aircraft will fly standard
formation (100 feet vertical, 1 mile horizontal from lead) unless the flight lead has requested and
ATC has approved a nonstandard formation. Departing flights of three or more will
automatically be considered a non-standard formation. The last element member of a flight in
non-standard formation will squawk 4000 Mode 3/C.
4.4. Dissimilar Formation Flights. 354 FW and TDY aircrews assigned to PAEI are
authorized to fly in dissimilar formations during departure and recovery. Dissimilar aircraft may
fly close formation provided it is briefed, emphasizing proper position, responsibilities,
airspeeds, signals, and aircraft-unique requirements. No more than four aircraft may fly in a
dissimilar formation. Flight members (similar or dissimilar) will ensure safe RWY separation is
maintained. This does not preclude ATC from taking action in the event of an unsafe condition.
Mixed formation low approaches are not authorized.
4.5. Quiet Hours.
   4.5.1. The 354 OG/CC or designated representative is the approval authority for the
   implementation of quiet hours and waiver authority for aircraft flying operations during quiet
   hours.
   4.5.2. Quiet hours are in effect for all aircraft operations 2200-0600L. No closed pattern
   work is to occur during this time. All arrivals will land via straight-in approaches. RWY 32
   is the preferred RWY for arrivals during quiet hours.
 36                                                       354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


   4.5.3. During quiet hours, IAW AFI 21-101_354FWSUP, maintenance personnel will not
   conduct engine runs without MXG/CC approval, with the following exceptions:
      4.5.3.1. Fighter type aircraft may run-up engine(s) to 80% in any maintenance bay(s)
      (the 8-bay/4-bay, the Hangars 1227 & 1228) or the South Loop area.
      4.5.3.2. Fighter type aircraft may run engine(s) up to max power in the hush house.
   4.5.4. Ceremonial quiet hours are granted by the 354 OG/CC for change of command
   ceremonies, parades, etc. Implementation of ceremonial quiet hours may prohibit engine
   runs, aircraft movement operations, or operations of aerospace ground equipment, with the
   exception of emergencies.
4.6. Departure Procedures.
   4.6.1. Control Tower must obtain releases from FAI ATCT on all IFR, SVFR, and TRSA
   departures.
   4.6.2. Aircraft not on a Departure Procedure (DP) will be instructed to, ―Fly runway
   heading.‖
   4.6.3. Fairbanks Approach automatically provides Terminal Radar Service Area (TRSA)
   service to all IFR and VFR participating aircraft flying in the PAEI and Instrument Approach
   Procedure (IAP) area. TRSA service provides radar sequencing and separation for VFR
   aircraft. All VFR aircraft shall receive TRSA services unless the pilot states, ―Negative
   TRSA.‖
   4.6.4. Initiate coordination for an unrestricted climb with GC during taxi.
   4.6.5. Always takeoff with landing or taxi light on to mitigate bird strike risk.
   4.6.6. Single ship rolling takeoffs are authorized at all times.
   4.6.7. Do not squawk Mode 3 and Mode C until cleared for takeoff. The trail aircraft will
   squawk 4000 Mode 3/C on trail departures until in standard formation.
   4.6.8. Protection of the 360° Overhead Pattern. Aircraft will remain at or below 1,500‘ MSL
   until the departure end of the RWY prior to turning out of traffic.
   4.6.9. Due to the volume of traffic in and around the PAEI Class D airspace, visual lookout
   and see-and-avoid will be emphasized on all flights. Fairbanks Approach Control will issue
   traffic advisories on departure. Avoid loitering in the block 3,000‘-5,000‘ MSL, in the area
   defined by EIL 140 radial clockwise to the EIL 320 radial out to 15 DME, to deconflict with
   aircraft established in the radar pattern.
   4.6.10. Tactical Departure. A tactical departure is a lateral maneuver executed shortly after
   takeoff to expedite a tactical formation. Tactical departures may be performed if:
      4.6.10.1. The flight will maintain VFR cloud clearances during the maneuver.
      4.6.10.2. Element maneuvering does not begin until aircraft are at least 500‘ AGL and
      past the departure end of the RWY at a minimum of 300 KIAS.
      4.6.10.3. At the departure end, a maximum of 90 degree heading changes until clear of
      Class D airspace. Once clear of Class D airspace aircraft may maneuver as required.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                 37


      4.6.10.4. Tower is notified of intent to execute tactical departure and given direction of
      travel.
   4.6.11. Minimum Risk Departure/Arrival Procedures. Reference 354 FW IFG. A Min-Risk
   departure/arrival is a VMC tactical maneuver designed to minimize the amount of time an
   aircraft is vulnerable to surface threats. Weather must be 500 feet above the planned
   maximum pattern altitude and the visibility must be at least 5 SM. Climbing/descending
   pattern above the field will be used to transition to/from the medium altitude environment.
      4.6.11.1. Min-Risk Departure. Flight leads will advise GC of their intention to fly a
      ―Min-Risk departure‖. ATC is the approval authority and must coordinate separation
      from local traffic and Fairbanks before clearing the flight for departure. Aircraft will fly
      single-ship takeoffs with 10 second spacing as a minimum. Accelerate in Mil/AB < 500‘
      AGL to climb speed of 350-400 KIAS. The departure will be flown on departure
      frequency. Initiate the ―figure 8‖ pattern to the southwest for both RWY 32/14
      operations. Remain within 3 NM of RWY climbing in a ―figure 8‖ pattern with the
      ground track as depicted in 354 FW IFG. Cross the midpoint of the airfield above 3,000‘
      MSL and climb to 4,000‘-9,000‘ MSL, where flights will then turn in the shortest
      direction to continue on their assigned clearance.
      4.6.11.2. Min-Risk Arrival. Pilots shall advise Fairbanks Approach on initial contact of
      their intentions to fly a ―Min-Risk arrival‖ (i.e., ―C/S, ATIS, altitude, position, Min-Risk
      arrival‖). ATC is the approval authority and must coordinate separation from local traffic
      and Fairbanks before clearing the flight to ―High Initial‖ in the 4,000‘-9,000‘ MSL block.
      Flights may approach the field in trail or from a tactical formation. All aircraft will
      transition to normal approach configuration and A/S prior to final and execute a full stop
      landing. If Min-Risk operations cease during use, aircraft in the Min-Risk pattern will
      low approach/breakout at the direction of the tower and re-enter for a normal initial.
          4.6.11.2.1. Pilots will: Report ―High Initial‖ in the 4,000‘-9,000‘ MSL block 5 NM
          from the departure end and add cardinal direction if not on the ―initial‖ ground track
          for the active runway. At departure end, flights will initiate a descending turn to the
          East for both RWY 32/14 operations and follow the ground track as depicted in 354
          FW IFG. Transition to a normal base from the east. Avoid overflight of the small
          arms range below 3,500‘AGL when hot and base housing below 3,500‘ MSL.
4.7. Special Use Airspace (SUA)/Range Entry and Exit. All aircrews must receive ATC
clearance from Anchorage Center or FAI ATCT prior to entering or exiting the JPARC.
   4.7.1. Range Entry/Check-in. ATC separation is provided until entering aircraft have
   crossed the boundary of SUA at ATC assigned routings and altitudes. All aircraft entering
   SUA must check-in with Eielson Range Control (ERC) on 229.4 or 125.3 with: working
   airspace/altitudes/times, restricted airspace request, and working frequency. Also include
   ―conducting lights-out operations‖ if you plan to fly with covert or lights-out NVG light
   settings. Expect ERC to respond with local altimeter, known traffic, clearance into requested
   restricted airspace, and clearance to tactical frequency. If unable contact with ERC, pass
   information ―in the blind.‖ Flights transiting through a MOA, including flights on MTRs
   will check in and remain on ERC frequency while within MOA boundaries.
 38                                                       354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


   4.7.2. Altimeter Setting Procedures. Use local altimeter setting when operating in SUA.
   ATCAA ceilings are defined using standard altimeter (29.92 inHg). When using local
   altimeter settings that are less than standard, the flight lead/aircraft commander is responsible
   to ensure all aircraft remain below the ceiling defined off standard altimeter. Reference the
   Flight Information Handbook (FIH) and 354 FW IFG for cold weather temperature errors.
   4.7.3. Early Entry. Work early entry request with Eielson Range Control on the ground to
   the maximum extent possible. Once airborne and talking to FAI ATCT or Anchorage
   Center, flights desiring early entry may coordinate with ERC and flights already in the area
   to expedite early entry approval and to work a MARSA agreement.
   4.7.4. Range Exit. All aircraft exiting SUA must check-out with ERC with exit intentions
   and number/type of ordnance expended. If departing VFR, cancel IFR clearance with
   Anchorage Center or request ERC to cancel your clearance. If departing IFR, contact
   Anchorage Center for clearance 3 minutes prior to exit. If aircrews anticipate being IFR with
   FAI ATCT, do not cancel IFR with Anchorage Center or ERC.
4.8. Cloud Break Procedures/IMC Operations in Alaska SUA. Pilots operating under an
IFR clearance may penetrate weather (i.e., fly in IMC) in Alaska SUA under the following
conditions:
   4.8.1. Monitored by or under the control of GCI/AWACS, approved to get to workable
   VMC airspace (if unable to remain VFR above or below a weather deck) or conduct
   intercepts IAW AFI 11-214:
      4.8.1.1. In Restricted or Warning Areas, ATCAAs (≥ FL180) and MOAs (< FL180).
      4.8.1.2. Descend no lower than the calculated MSA.
   4.8.2. Without GCI/AWACS control, pilots are approved to get to workable VMC airspace
   (if unable to remain VFR above or below a weather deck) or conduct intercepts:
      4.8.2.1. In Restricted or Warning Areas.
      4.8.2.2. In ATCAAs (≥ FL180).
      4.8.2.3. Descend no lower than the calculated MSA.
      4.8.2.4. In MOAs (< FL180). Must be under ANC Center Control.
          4.8.2.4.1. Remain under ANC Center control for traffic point outs (ANC Center does
          not provide obstacle clearance in SUA).
          4.8.2.4.2. ANC Center may deny this service if other military aircraft in the same
          airspace are not on Center‘s frequency. In this case, you may have to leave SUA to
          get vectored through the weather.
          4.8.2.4.3. Do not descend IMC east of the W144 00 line due to uncontrolled airspace
          below 14,500‘ MSL.
      4.8.2.5. Pilots should use solid ORM principles when operating IMC below FL180.
      Consider fuel, airspace timing, location and VFR traffic volume.
   4.8.3. Deconflict during IMC/weather penetration with other military traffic using prior
   coordination, Eielson Range Control, radios, data link and/or fighter radar.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                 39


     4.8.3.1. Prior coordination. Pilots will have an altitude and/or geographic deconfliction
     plan briefed when operating MARSA in the same airspace to include callsign and
     planned operating frequency (or discrete frequency) of all aircraft in the airspace.
     4.8.3.2. Eielson Range Control. Contact Range Control to ensure no unanticipated
     military aircraft are working in the airspace and inform them of the
     MARSA/deconfliction plan, if applicable. Range Control may provide point outs of
     other military or civilian aircraft; however, they may not see all aircraft in the airspace.
     Eielson Range Control provides Restricted Area control and may provide traffic
     advisories, but they are not an aircraft controlling agency.         Pilots are ultimately
     responsible for aircraft deconfliction.
     4.8.3.3. Radios. Use the common/discrete frequency of other players to ensure or
     establish deconfliction. Flights deviating from the briefed deconfliction plan are required
     to inform all other flights ASAP.
     4.8.3.4. Fighter Radar. If available, use fighter radar prior to weather penetration as a
     final check to ensure the airspace is clear of traffic.
     4.8.3.5. DELETED
  4.8.4. During Air Refueling Operations (For AAR Tracks within ATCAA‘s).
     4.8.4.1. IMC Air Refueling is authorized in ATCAAs IAW MDS specific IMC/AAR
     guidance.
     4.8.4.2. All pilots participating in air refueling will have a briefed altitude deconfliction
     plan for entering and exiting the air refueling area during IMC conditions. Aircraft
     entering the AAR area off their scheduled time will ensure deconfliction real-time. All
     aircraft will be in their assigned altitude block and on boom frequency prior to entering
     the AAR airspace.
     4.8.4.3. Default procedure (if not briefed differently to all players). Aircraft entering the
     AAR track at their scheduled time will have tanker altitude minus 1,000‘-2,000‘. Aircraft
     exiting will have the tanker altitude plus 1,000‘-2,000‘.

4.9. Air Refueling (AR) Tracks and Procedures. Reference AP/1B and 354 FW IFG for a
depiction of AR tracks and locations.
4.10. Low Altitude Training. Minimum operating altitudes will be commensurate with
training objectives, individual altitude block certification, AFI 11-2MDS, Vol. 3 restrictions, and
this supplement.
   4.10.1. Low Altitude Awareness Training (LOWAT) attacks and reactions will be limited to
   the most restrictive Low Altitude Step Down Training (LASDT) category in the flight. All
   LOWAT will be conducted in authorized airspace (i.e. MOA, VR/IR route, restricted area).
   4.10.2. Call flight service on frequency (255.4) when commencing low altitude tactical
   navigation and pass the following general information: call sign, number and type aircraft,
   airspeed, altitude to be flown, and general route of flight.
   4.10.3. Cross the Alyeska Pipeline at a minimum altitude of 500‘ AGL, and if possible, cross
   the pipeline at right angles. Pipeline security helicopters monitor VHF 122.9.
   4.10.4. Single-ship LATN (low altitude tactical navigation). The minimum altitude for
   fighter daylight operations is 1,000‘ AGL.
4.11. ACBT Training. Conduct ACBT only in approved SUA IAW AFI 11-214.
   4.11.1. Yukon Measurement and Debriefing System (YMDS) will be used for all missions to
   the maximum extent possible.
   4.11.2. For all altitude scenarios, a transition altitude and maneuvering limits at low/high
   altitudes will be briefed.
   4.11.3. Units may develop RTO training/qualification programs and RTO procedures for use
   in training missions.
4.12. JPARC Recovery Options. When ready to RTB, aircrews will use the call sign and
squawk which was used with FAI ATCT prior to SUA/range entry. Pilots have three options to
recover from SUA when greater than 30 NM out. Option one, proceed VFR if IFR was canceled
prior to entering a restricted area. Option two, contact Anchorage Center to ―Cancel IFR‖ prior
to exiting SUA and proceed VFR. Pilots may request Eielson Range Control to cancel IFR with
Anchorage Center. Option three, contact Anchorage Center 10 to 15 NM prior to the IFR/VFR
pick-up point before exiting SUA and proceed with IFR clearance. All recoveries to PAEI,
except VFR direct from R-2205 (through Ester), should check-in with Fairbanks Approach NLT
20 NM with ―call sign, position, ATIS, intentions or request.‖ Maximum speed on recovery
below 10,000‘ MSL is 300 KIAS.
   4.12.1. For VFR recovery, upon reaching 15 NM from Eielson or when handed off from
   Fairbanks Approach, contact Tower with position, VFR entry point (SALLY, NANCY, or
   ESTER), and intentions. Cross the VFR entry points at 2,500‘ MSL for initial or 1,500‘
   MSL for a straight in.
   4.12.2. Do not overfly concentration of houses in North Pole when entering from Nancy
   (EIL270/7.)
   4.12.3. When approaching the field from the east (i.e., R-2205), tactical formations may
   overfly the base at 3,500‘ MSL and, with tower approval, descend directly to inside
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                              41


   downwind. The flight lead will ensure that wingman take sufficient spacing. Do not overfly
   the Small Arms Range below 3,500‘ AGL or NOTAM‘d altitude when ―hot‖.
   4.12.4. MFE Recovery Options. The Salcha, Harding, North Pole, Gilmore, and DOG ONE
   recoveries are profiles designed to be used as pre-planned recoveries during visual weather
   conditions at PAEI in order to recover a large number of aircraft to the overhead traffic
   pattern for landing at PAEI. These recoveries will only be used during RED FLAG-Alaska,
   NORTHERN EDGE, and other coordinated MFEs. These recoveries will not be used during
   local 354 FW flying. Reference RF-A IFG Supplement and applicable exercise SPINS.
       4.12.4.1. VFR recoveries are limited to flights of 4 with 10 NM spacing between flights
       (tail to lead), except on the DOG ONE which allows up to 8 aircraft divided into 4-ship
       cells (i.e. 2 groups of 4) with no more than 3 NM spacing between cells of the flight.
       4.12.4.2. Southern Recoveries. The Salcha Recovery is to RWY 32 and the Harding
       Recovery is to RWY 14. Both recoveries begin at BOGIE in the block 5,500-9,000‘
       MSL. Based on FAI TRSA radar limitations, these recoveries will seldom be used.
       4.12.4.3. Northern Recoveries. The North Pole Recovery is to RWY 32 and the Gilmore
       Recovery is to RWY 14. Both recoveries begin at FALCO at 9,000‘ MSL. The North
       Pole Recovery is the primary recovery as it mirrors Eielson‘s TACAN and ILS
       approaches until aircraft are allowed to turn early (VFR) to the VFR reporting point
       SALLY. The North Pole Recovery provides the best option to transition to an IFR
       recovery.
       4.12.4.4. DOG ONE Recovery. DOG ONE uses a VFR corridor in the Yukon 1/2
       MOAs to expedite fighter-only recoveries. Fighters shall remain VMC at all times. The
       recovery allows for 4+4 formations if MARSA, with 10 NM spacing between flights.
       Aircrews are responsible for the 10NM spacing between flights. Fighters will exit the
       JPARC at the VFR reporting point ESTER and proceed to initial. Any compression of the
       recovery may require Control Tower to stack aircraft/formations at SALLY until such a
       time that they may proceed inbound.
4.13. Trail Recovery Procedures. PAEI and Fairbanks IAP trail recoveries are covered by
LOA with Fairbanks Approach and this supplement. Radar trail recoveries apply only to aircraft
with suitable on-board systems and approved operational procedures. Aircrews will maintain
their own separation by using onboard radar systems. For multiple approaches, after an executed
low approach/landing, the flight is responsible for their own separation until approved ATC
separation is achieved between elements. Notify ATC of nonstandard formations. Trail
recoveries will comply with the following:
   4.13.1. Request radar trail recovery with approach control. A maximum of 4 aircraft are
   authorized in trail recovery.
   4.13.2. Establish trail spacing between flight members (normally 1.5 NM minimum – 2.0
   NM maximum) NLT the final approach fix (FAF). Spacing may be increased to 3.0 NM for
   low RCR. If proper spacing is not established by the FAF and under IMC, wingmen should
   execute missed approach/climbout instructions and obtain a separate ATC clearance.
   4.13.3. Flight leads will declare intentions to drag wingmen with ATC prior to taking
   spacing. If a drag maneuver is used, the lead aircraft will maintain a minimum of 300 KIAS
 42                                                          354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


    until the trail aircraft is established. Notify each ATC agency if the lead aircraft is not the
    normal element lead (e.g. ―Tower, (Callsign) is the lead aircraft, followed by (Callsign).‖)
    ATC instructions to the lead aircraft apply to the entire flight. The trailing wingmen will
    squawk Mode 3, 4000 (IFR) or 1200 (VFR), and Mode C prior to exceeding standard
    formation spacing or IAW ATC.
    4.13.4. All aircraft must report the FAF if on a published approach or ―5 miles‖ for a VFR
    straight-in.
    4.13.5. Contact Lost. If the trail aircraft loses radar/visual contact, notify the lead aircraft.
    Lead will respond with altitude, airspeed, and heading and establish altitude deconfliction. If
    VMC, revert to VFR. If IMC, coordinate separate clearances. If on a published segment of
    the approach, flights may continue the approach if separation can be confirmed using
    NAVAIDS. If separation cannot be confirmed, execute missed approach or climb-out as
    directed by ATC.
    4.13.6. Pattern Breakout. Prior to the FAF, all aircraft will remain in trail and follow ATC
    instructions. After the FAF, break out instructions apply only to the lead aircraft. All other
    aircraft will continue the approach unless directed otherwise by ATC. Separate break outs
    may be issued, as needed. See paragraph 4.14.8 for more information on breakouts.
    4.13.7. Missed Approach. If a missed approach is executed by a single aircraft, follow
    normal missed approach procedures. When executing the missed approach, the pilot shall
    use extreme caution while accelerating and use altitude deconfliction, if necessary, to avoid
    preceding aircraft. If more than one aircraft executes a missed approach, each trail aircraft is
    responsible for separation from the preceding aircraft until prescribed ATC separation is
    achieved.
    4.13.8. Low approach/Climb out. During climb out for additional radar patterns, individual
    aircraft will follow climb out instructions and request a separate clearance from ATC. Use
    normal climb out airspeeds and onboard systems to ensure separation from preceding/trailing
    aircraft prior to ATC assuming responsibility. See paragraph 4.15 for more information on
    local climb out.
4.14. VFR Traffic Pattern Procedures. VFR is defined as 1,500‘ AGL and 3 SM visibility.
Weather minimums are based solely on the official weather observation provided by base
weather. ATC controllers and the SOF are not official weather observers and cannot open traffic
patterns if the official weather observation will not allow it. Minimum VFR traffic pattern
weather is 500 feet above pattern altitude and 3 SM visibility. Aircrews should expect frequency
change to Control Tower approximately 7 NM from PAEI. Control Tower will consider all
aircraft a full stop from Initial unless advised otherwise on initial contact. Control Tower will
not issue landing clearance to each aircraft that are part of a single flight. When Control Tower
issues the flight landing clearance to the flight lead, it is clearance for all aircraft in the flight to
land. Flight lead will acknowledge landing clearance for flight. Subsequent flight members will
make a ―gear‖ call only and do not need to state intentions. Flight members who do not wish to
land will make their request with Control Tower and receive a separate clearance. This
procedure will reduce frequency congestion especially during MFE recoveries and complies with
FAA JO 7110.65 guidance. NOTE: Tower WS may close the VFR traffic patterns if they are
unable to maintain visual contact with aircraft at any point in the pattern.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                43


  4.14.1. General. The VFR traffic pattern consists of the overhead, the rectangular pattern,
  and the VFR straight-in pattern. The direction of traffic is right for RWY 14 and left for
  RWY 32 (west of runway).
     4.14.1.1. VFR patterns are authorized only during daylight hours and during civil
     twilight as defined by the Air Almanac, and only if there is sufficient visibility and light
     to provide good visual references in the pattern. Formation landings are authorized
     during civil twilight. The WS makes the determination whether visibility/conditions in
     the VFR traffic pattern warrant its closure or closure of the SFO pattern. The SOF may
     make recommendations to the WS.
     4.14.1.2. Fighter airspeed in the PAEI Local VFR pattern is 300 KIAS unless
     configuring to land, established on a straight-in, or on tactical initial.
 44                                                     354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


Figure 4.14. VFR Traffic Patterns




      4.14.1.3. Aircraft executing go-around, low approach, or departure will maintain at or
      below 1,500‘ MSL until reaching the departure end off the RWY, unless instructed
      otherwise by tower. Aircraft executing a low approach will not directly overfly aircraft
      on the RWY. Clear the RWY to the southwest.
      4.14.1.4. Aircraft will squawk IFF Mode 3 of 1200 when established in the VFR pattern
      with intent to remain with tower.
      4.14.1.5. Radio Procedures. Pilots will add intentions (full stop, option, low approach,
      etc.), if appropriate to all initial, final, and base calls. Utilize UHF to the max extent.
   4.14.2. Overhead Patterns. Initial entry into the overhead pattern is via a VFR reporting
   point (SALLY, ESTER, or NANCY) at 2,500‘ MSL and 300 KIAS. Aircrews must report
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    45


  the VFR reporting point prior to tower approval to proceed to initial. NOTE: The Tanana
  River separates aircraft that are in the airport traffic pattern from those proceeding to the
  VFR entry points.
     4.14.2.1. Aircraft on initial entry into the pattern will yield to aircraft established in the
     pattern. Pilots will report ―initial‖ and state intentions (full stop, low approach, etc.) at 3-
     5 NM from the RWY, at 2,000‘ MSL. Aircraft directed to ―carry through‖ initial will
     maintain 2,000‘ MSL, turn crosswind at departure end, and reenter via SALLY/NANCY
     at 2,500‘ MSL (unless otherwise directed by Tower).
     4.14.2.2. Standard Break. Standard break is to the west for both RWY 32 and RWY 14.
     The break will be initiated over the numbers unless directed otherwise.
     4.14.2.3. Overhead Pattern Weather Minimums. 2,500‘ AGL (3,000‘ MSL) and 3 SM
     visibility.
  4.14.3. Tactical Initial. Tactical Initial is flown at 300-350 KIAS in a line-abreast formation,
  4-ship maximum, with the second element no more than 9,000‘ in trail. Wingman will offset
  no more than 6,000‘ and not over fly base housing. Normal pattern spacing will be
  established in the break. Include ―TAC Initial‖ with the request for VFR entry to initial.
  Pilots established in a tactical initial pattern and instructed to breakout are responsible for
  maintaining their separation from each other.
  4.14.4. VFR Straight-In Patterns. Request a straight-in approach upon initial contact with
  ATC. Entry to a VFR straight-in is via a VFR reporting point at 1,500‘ MSL. Aircrews must
  report the VFR reporting point prior to tower approval for the straight-in. Once cleared for
  the straight-in, pilots will proceed to a 3 - 5 NM final.
     4.14.4.1. VFR Straight-In Pattern Weather Minimums. 1,500‘ AGL (2,000‘ MSL) and 3
     SM visibility.
  4.14.5. Rectangular Pattern. The rectangular pattern is flown to the west of the airfield
  regardless of RWY in use. Pattern altitude is 2,000‘ MSL for fighters (1,500‘ MSL for non-
  fighters). The rectangular pattern is only used to reenter initial when multiple patterns are
  desired or as a low weather option when the normal overhead is closed. Entry to the
  rectangular pattern when the overhead pattern is closed is available out of a VFR straight-in
  or an IFR approach to tower.
     4.14.5.1. Rectangular Pattern Weather Minimums. 2,000‘ AGL (2,500‘ MSL) and 3 SM
     visibility
  4.14.6. Closed Pattern. Closed patterns will be accomplished at the departure end of the
  RWY. Present position closed maneuvers are authorized with Control Tower approval.
  Aircraft will perform a climbing turn to 2,000‘ MSL for fighters (1,500‘ MSL for non-
  fighter) and enter the respective downwind.
  4.14.7. Reentry Patterns. Aircraft desiring to reenter via the VFR reporting point will
  request "reenter." If approved/directed to reenter, the aircraft will cross the departure end of
  the RWY, proceed west of the Tanana River, then proceed to and report the appropriate VFR
  reporting point at 2,500‘ MSL.
  4.14.8. Breakout. Tower personnel may direct breakout when a perceived conflict results.
  Aircraft climb to 2,500‘ MSL and proceed west across the Tanana River then to the VFR
 46                                                      354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


   entry point. Clear for aircraft that may be entering at VFR entry point. If self-initiated for a
   conflict, make an advisory call to tower (―C/S, position, pattern breakout, reenter
   SALLY/NANCY.‖) After turning base leg, aircraft will be instructed to go around rather
   than break out. If necessary, to keep aircraft on takeoff leg in sight, aircraft will clear the
   RWY to the west using shallow bank turns, turn crosswind at the departure end of the RWY
   or as directed by the tower. Delay the turn only when necessary to obtain spacing behind an
   aircraft established on crosswind.
4.15. Eielson Standard Climb Out, Go-Around Procedures, and Radar Traffic
Pattern. Eielson ATC will use the phraseology ―execute local climb out‖ when instructing
aircraft for standard climb outs and go-around. Aircraft shall fly RWY heading, remain at or
below 1,500‘ MSL until the departure end of the RWY, and then climb and maintain 3,000‘
MSL. Planned airspeed in the Eielson radar pattern is 250 KIAS, unless configuring/configured
to land or executing climb out/missed approach. NOTE: Local climb out and go-around
procedures are the same.
4.16. Fighter/Attack/FAC Pilot Weather Category (PWC) A Approaches. The 354 OG/CC
(or designated representative) must approve PWC A certified pilots to fly approaches to
published minimums at PAEI or local divert bases during actual IMC less than 300‘ ceiling or 1
SM visibility (300-1). The SOF will pass OG/CC approval to category A certified pilots and
may issue additional OG/CC guidance. When off-station, PWC A pilots may fly IMC
approaches to published minimums below 300-1 without specific 354 OG/CC approval when
sound judgment deems the approach as the best method to deal with poor or deteriorating
weather conditions.
4.17. Opposite Direction Procedures. Opposite direction cutoff procedures will be applied
IAW Fairbanks Approach/Eielson Air Traffic Control Tower Letter Of Agreement (FAI/PAEI
ATC LOA). Opposite direction arrivals/departures will be used when necessary for noise
abatement procedures, heavy/tanker operations during MFEs, or as required to expedite
operations. Aircraft should request an opposite direction takeoff with Eielson Ground on initial
contact.
   4.17.1. Arrival verses Arrival. Opposite direction arrivals shall not proceed closer on final
   until the aircraft approaching the RWY in use has touched down (full stop) or has completed
   a low approach/touch-and-go and turned to avoid conflict. The following cutoffs shall be
   applied:
       4.17.1.1. A minimum 10 NM cut-off point from the airport will be used to deconflict all
       opposite direction traffic arrivals if both aircraft are IFR.
       4.17.1.2. A minimum of 7 NM will be used if one or both aircraft are VFR.
   4.17.2. Departure verses Arrival. Opposite direction departures must be airborne, turned to
   avoid conflict, and established on a course (diverging by at least 45°) from the reciprocal of
   the final approach course before the arriving aircraft has reached the cut-off point. The
   following cutoffs shall be applied:
       4.17.2.1. A minimum 10 NM cut-off point from the airport will be used to deconflict all
       opposite direction traffic departures if both aircraft are IFR.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                              47


       4.17.2.2. A minimum of 7 NM will be used if one or both aircraft are VFR. NOTE:
       Known aircraft/flight characteristics may require additional separation.
4.18. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). IAW PACAF LOA, RSRS standards (less
than FAA JO 7110.65 standard separation) apply to all PACAF assigned aircraft at PACAF
bases where ATC is provided by USAF controllers. Non-PACAF aircraft may participate in
RSRS if covered under letter of agreement (i.e. Joint Letter of Agreement on RSRS at PACAF
bases). See Attachment 8 RSRS.
4.19. Safety Chase. Safety chase will not descend below 300‘ AGL during low approaches.
When the wingman acts as a safety observer for practice instrument approaches or simulated
emergency procedures, the flight lead will brief him on the proper position and safety observer
responsibilities.

                                           Chapter 5

                     WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT AND RANGE USE

5.1. General. Accomplish simulated weapons deliveries only in MOAs, restricted areas,
warning areas, and off range within the guidelines established in AFI 11-2MDSV3 and AFI 11-
214.    All specific range procedures/ordnance restrictions will be IAW AFI 13-
212V1_11AFSUP1, Range Operations and Procedures.
5.2. Ordnance Departure Procedures. There are no departure restrictions for aircraft carrying
practice ordnance, hot guns, or internally/externally carried inert/live ordnance.
5.3. Range Check-in/out Procedures. Pilots planning on using R-2202, R-2205, or R-2211
will first check-in with Eielson Range Control on 229.4 UHF or 125.3 VHF. Range Control will
pass essential range information and then coordinate appropriate range frequency. All flight
members must acknowledge range restrictions and altimeter setting provided by Range Control.
Flights should monitor the appropriate range frequency even if not planning to use TOSS.
Aircraft exiting the range will check out with Range Control. See the 354 FW IFG for standard
radio frequency presets.
5.4. Range Operations.
   5.4.1. Range Clearing Pass. Clearing passes are particularly important on local ranges. The
   local ranges are open access where personnel and animals may unwittingly venture into the
   impact areas unannounced. On Class B or C ranges, an airborne or ground FAC may
   perform the clearing pass for the flight. In addition, no clearing pass is required if the range
   is in continuous use, but confirmation via radio with the preceding flight is required.
   5.4.2. Pilots are required to use AVTR/DVR on all missions.
   5.4.3. Self-protection flare employment by 354 FW aircraft is limited to a minimum altitude
   of 400‘/700‘ AGL (M-206/MJU-7) or as restricted by fire indexes (whichever is higher) over
   the impact areas of R-2205 and R-2202. Minimum altitude in any other airspace approved
   for self-protection flare employment is based upon the most restrictive of AFI 11-214, AFI
   13-212, AFI 11-2MDSV3, or local supplements.
   5.4.4. R-2211 operating instructions. R-2211 will have a Range Control Officer (RCO)
   available Tuesday through Thursday, 10 hours each day. The window may slide to
   accommodate the most users. Because of range tower limitations, only low-angle events (20
   degrees and lower) will be controlled by the RCO. When performing these events pilots will
   make all standard radio calls and require a ―Cleared Hot‖ from the RCO prior to release.
   High-angle events (greater than 20 degrees) will be under control of the flight lead. For
   high-angle events pilots will make all standard radio calls on range frequency, but do not
   require RCO clearance to expend weapons (flight lead control).
   5.4.5. Electronic Warfare Flight Training. R-2202 and R-2205 are equipped with electronic
   threat simulators (video capable) and communications jamming sites. These sites are
   typically manned five days per week and are available to support 354 FW aircraft.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                49


       5.4.5.1. Threat Simulators. Refer to AFI 13-212V1_11AFSUP1 for capabilities and
       scheduling information. Currently, squadron intelligence/flight leads schedule threat
       simulators through Range Control at 377-3125.
       5.4.5.2. EW Debriefing. Video is available from threat simulators for debriefs. Advise
       Range Control at 377-3125 prior to your brief.
   5.4.6. Mississippi Joint Use Area (MJUA) Live Fire Restrictions. Due to the higher
   potential of unexploded ordnance (UXOs) in the MJUA, pilots will use the following
   minimum altitudes when delivering any munitions (live, training, BDU, gun, rockets) in this
   part of R-2202. Use a minimum recovery altitude of 3,500‘ AGL and horizontal range of
   4,000 feet to avoid the potential MK-84 frag pattern of UXOs.
   5.4.7. Range maintenance, closures, and/or EOD detonations. Tactical training in range
   airspace is approved under the following conditions:
       5.4.7.1. All surface attacks will be DRY/SIMULATED with no ordnance expended.
       Exceptions will only be authorized IAW AFI13-212 guidelines.
       5.4.7.2. Follow AFI 11-214 and AFI 11-2MDS for off-range attacks.
       5.4.7.3. No combat laser operations or live ordnance on aircraft.
       5.4.7.4. Air-to-Air operations authorized with all training ordnance and no expendable
       ordnance station selected.
       5.4.7.5. Minimum altitude of 3,000‘ AGL (10,000‘ AGL during periods of EOD
       detonation).
       5.4.7.6. No altitude restrictions when no ground personnel are present.         Weapons
       releases still prohibited in accordance with paragraph 5.4.7.1.
5.5. Unexpended Ordnance Recovery. There are no restrictions for aircraft with unexpended
training/ forward firing ordnance (FFO), self-protection flares, captive missiles or internally
carried munitions when bomb bay doors are closed.
   5.5.1. Aircraft configured with external inert ordnance will fly a straight-in approach to the
   active RWY.
   5.5.2. Aircraft configured with external live ordnance will fly a straight-in approach to RWY
   32 and expect back taxi to Taxiway E.
 50                                                     354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


                                          Chapter 6

                               ABNORMAL PROCEDURES

6.1. General. The following procedures ensure that the recovery of emergency aircraft is safe
and effective. No directive can address all possible circumstances; therefore, situations not
covered must be handled IAW flight manual procedures with SOF assistance and common sense.
In addition, other abnormal operating procedures are covered with appropriate references to
parent regulations/plans.
   6.1.1. Notify the SOF (Callsign: ―Sourdough‖ on local CH 18) as soon as possible of any in-
   flight emergency especially if it will affect runway operations. Relay information through
   ATC, if required.
   6.1.2. On and off base emergency response procedures will be IAW Eielson Mishap
   Response Plan.
6.2. Declaration Authority. Situations affecting safety of flight or air worthiness, and those
which necessitate priority handling require declaration of an emergency and termination of the
mission. Emergencies may be declared by the aircrew, air traffic controllers, SOF, or officials
responsible for the operation of the aircraft.
6.3. Emergency Single Frequency Approach (SFA) Procedures. The primary discrete
emergency frequency for PAEI is 259.1 (CH 15). SFA‘s reduce workload of distressed aircrew
and provide a common frequency for emergency coordination.
   6.3.1. FAI ATCT will assign CH 15 to radio equipped emergency aircraft as soon as
   practical unless otherwise requested by aircrew. Tower, SOF, and Fire Chief/senior fire
   officer (Chief 2) have access to this frequency.
   6.3.2. FAI ATCT and the SOF will provide emergency information to the tower, as soon as
   practical.
   6.3.3. If a cable engagement occurs, tower will relinquish control of CH 15 to Fire Chief or
   designated representative once IFE aircraft engages the barrier and comes to a complete stop.
   If an aircraft does not engage the cable and intends to shut down on the RWY, tower will
   relinquish control of CH 15 to Fire Chief once the aircraft comes to a complete stop.
   6.3.4. When an aircraft declares a ground emergency or emergency aborts on takeoff and the
   Fire Chief requests use of CH 15, tower will coordinate with FAI ATCT, then relinquish CH
   15 as soon as possible.
   6.3.5. Once the emergency is terminated, Fire Chief shall relinquish control of CH 15 back
   to Control Tower. Tower will release the frequency back to FAI ATCT upon emergency
   termination.
6.4. FOD Check. Tower will suspend RWY ops upon touchdown of all emergency aircraft.
AMOPS will perform a FOD check of the RWY before resuming RWY ops. SOF is the waiver
authority for FOD checks.
6.5. Ground Emergencies. Reference 354 FW IFG.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               51


  6.5.1. Hot Brake Procedures. Pilots who suspect hot brakes for any reason, will declare ―hot
  brakes‖ with tower/ground control. Control Tower, upon notification or suspecting that an
  aircraft has hot brakes, will activate the Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS). Tower will
  direct the aircraft to the nearest hot brake area. Taxiways A, B, C, D, and E are all
  designated hot brake areas.
     6.5.1.1. If active alert aircraft are scheduled/operating at PAEI, aircraft with suspected
     hot brakes exiting at Taxiway E must taxi past and stop well clear of the CAC high speed
     taxiway.
     6.5.1.2. Pilots should turn the aircraft into existing wind, if able. Fire Chief will
     determine if hot brakes exist. Inspection personnel will arrive, install chocks, and verify
     brake temperature. If the aircraft has hot brakes, a 300 foot cordon will be established
     and the aircraft will be shut down. The Fire Chief in coordination with the SOF will
     determine which actions are appropriate.
     6.5.1.3. If at any time, brakes or tires ignite, fire/maintenance personnel will signal the
     pilot, who will shut down and evacuate the aircraft. Pilots will emergency ground egress
     and depart the aircraft in the eleven to one o‘clock direction until reaching a safe
     distance.
  6.5.2. EPU/Hydrazine Procedures. For any ground or in-flight EPU activation or suspected
  hydrazine leak, the pilot will accomplish applicable checklists and follow procedures in the
  354 FW IFG and MDS-specific flight manual. The hydrazine area is the first de-arm spot on
  Taxiway A or E.
     6.5.2.1. Tower will provide the current winds to aircraft with EPU activation (emergency
     power).
     6.5.2.2. For emergency aircraft on landing, tower will taxi and hold the aircraft at either
     Taxiway A or E. Pilots should park with hydrazine port downwind, if able (i.e. F-16 left
     wing into the wind). Pilots should not shut down the aircraft until told to do so by
     emergency responders. Fire Chief controls access until the emergency is terminated.
  6.5.3. Known/Suspected Malfunction Procedures. The following malfunctions normally
  require shutting down the engine as soon as practical after the aircraft has been chocked and
  the landing gear pins are installed. Ground area personnel are expected to assist in the
  determination of the best course of action. Pilots experiencing any of the following
  malfunctions will contact squadron safety and 354 FW/SE as soon as practical after mission
  termination:
     6.5.3.1. Hydraulic system failure.
     6.5.3.2. Hydraulic fluid leaks.
     6.5.3.3. Electrical system (complete electrical failure/cycling).
     6.5.3.4. Fuel leak.
     6.5.3.5. Engine - known/suspected FOD ingestion, unusual engine vibration/noise, or
     other serious indications.
     6.5.3.6. Nose wheel steering malfunction.
 52                                                       354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


       6.5.3.7. Brake malfunctions.
       6.5.3.8. Hot brakes.
       6.5.3.9. Fire indication, whether fire is confirmed or not.
       6.5.3.10. Structural damage.
       6.5.3.11. Unsecurely mounted ordnance or external store.
       6.5.3.12. Smoke or fumes in the cockpit.
6.6. Weapons System Malfunctions. If an emergency occurs during any air-to-surface
weapons delivery, the flight will cease all operations and assist the emergency aircraft until the
emergency is under control and the aircraft has departed the range. Reference 354 FW IFG.
   6.6.1. Armament System Malfunction Procedures. In addition to the armament system
   malfunctions listed in AFI 11- 2MDSV3, the following apply:
       6.6.1.1. A multiple release is a release of more than one store or ordnance when only a
       single release was commanded. The distinction between ―inadvertent release‖ and
       ―multiple release‖ is the word ―commanded.‖ Although more stores/ordnance were
       released than intended on a multiple release, a release was commanded. A multiple
       release should be written up in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and
       Work Document, but does not require an air abort.
       6.6.1.2. Dropped Object, Inadvertent Release, Unintentional Release.           Follow the
       procedures outlined in 354 FW IFG and following paragraphs.
       6.6.1.3. In event of a runaway gun, safe the gun according to the T.O. 1MDS-34-1-1CL-
       1, recover and fly straight ahead ensuring that the gun is aimed toward an uninhabited
       area until the gun stops firing. Prevent unnecessarily pointing the gun toward populated
       areas during recovery. Recover to base IAW the 354 FW IFG for Hung/Unsafe Forward
       Firing Ordnance.
   6.6.2. Hung Ordnance. Notify the SOF of all instances of hung ordnance. Declare an IFE for
   all hung ordnance except hung secure/unsecure BDU-33s, hung secure inerts or hung secure
   rockets. The SOF will advise the tower supervisor of pertinent emergency aircraft data, the
   type/quantity of ordnance involved, estimated landing time, and any services required. Tower
   personnel will activate the PCAS and notify the appropriate agencies. 354 FW/CP will notify
   explosive ordnance (EOD) and de-arm crews.
       6.6.2.1. Eielson Hung Ordnance Recovery Procedures. Reference 354 FW IFG. Clear
       the runway at normal de-arm except as noted below. With hung heavyweight (live or
       inert) ordnance RWY 32 is the preferred recovery runway. The following procedures
       apply to all recoveries with hung secure or hung unsecure ordnance:
           6.6.2.1.1. Aircrew shall safe all armament switches and notify SOF/AIRBOSS. If
           able, aircrew will jettison the suspension equipment in the designated jettison area(s).
           If unable, aircrew will declare an IFE.
           6.6.2.1.2. Aircrews (coming from R-2202/2211) will remain 1-3 NM west of the
           Tanana River, avoid populated areas to the maximum extent possible, and fly a
           straight-in approach.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                               53


          6.6.2.1.3. Aircrews (coming from R-2205) will fly direct ESTER for a RWY 32
          straight-in, or remain abeam Moose Creek Bluff for a RWY 14 straight-in.
          6.6.2.1.4. Straight-in to RWY 32 is the preferred landing. Aircraft should avoid over
          flight of populated areas to the max extent possible.
          6.6.2.1.5. Hung/Unsafe Forward Firing Ordnance. Prevent unnecessarily pointing at
          populated areas during recovery. When landing with any hung forward firing
          ordnance, the entire runway will be clear prior to touchdown. RWY 32 is normally
          the preferred recovery for any type of hung forward firing ordnance. If the runway
          RCR is <12, RWY 14 becomes the preferred recovery runway. After landing on
          RWY 32, execute a left 180 degree turn to back taxi down the runway to Taxiway E.
          If landing on RWY 14, continue to the end, pull clear at Taxiway E. Taxi the aircraft
          into the first available de-arm spot, heading 140.
          6.6.2.1.6. Unsafe Gun Recovery. Follow procedures above in paragraph 6.6.2.1.5.
          After landing/de-arm, advise SOF of any change in status. If the gun cannot be safed,
          expect taxi clearance to the gun berm for shut down. In situations where two A/C
          have jammed guns or an A/C is on the gun berm and cannot be moved, Taxiway E
          heading 140 degrees may be used as an alternate gun clearing/safing area with
          MXG/CC approval. Reference 354 FW IFG for gun berm location.

Figure 6.1. Eielson Hung Ordnance Routes




   6.6.3. Jettison Procedures. Inert or live ordnance hung unsecure must be jettisoned. If
   ordnance cannot be jettisoned, attempt to jettison rack, if applicable. If unable to jettison

          6.6.3.5.3. R-2211. Nuc Circle (inert only).
6.7. Lost Communications/NORDO Procedures. NOTE: These procedures do not apply to
aircraft in formation flights when one aircraft has an operable radio.
   6.7.1. Day VMC. Squawk Mode 3 7600 (7700 for emergency), proceed VFR to an entry
   point then to initial. Break at the approach end and monitor Control Tower for light gun
   signals.
   6.7.2. Night, unable VMC, or IMC. If unable to proceed VFR, squawk Mode 3 7600 (7700
   for emergency), maintain the higher of MSA, expected, or last ATC assigned altitude.
   Proceed to FALCO or BOGIE and execute the ILS or TACAN approach for the last known
   RWY in use.
6.8. Arresting System Engagement Procedures. When an aircraft engages a BAK-12, Tower
shall request aircraft engagement speed, aircraft type, and gross weight. Tower will pass this
information to Barrier Maintenance personnel or the senior fire official via the crash net.
   6.8.1. Post Barrier Engagement Procedures. To ensure rapid reopening of the RWY after an
   arresting system engagement, follow these procedures:
       6.8.1.1. To preclude damage to personnel and equipment, all aircrew actions (up to the
       point of being cleared to taxi) will be as directed by the ground OSC via hand signals as
       shown in AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground, or via UHF
       radio.
       6.8.1.2. If cable disengagement cannot be accomplished or the aircraft is unable to taxi
       clear of the RWY safely, the aircraft will be shut down and a recovery team will tow the
       aircraft clear of the RWY.
       6.8.1.4. Successive cable engagements can be accomplished approximately 20 minutes
       after disengagement of the preceding aircraft. NOTE: More time may be required during
       winter conditions, after duty hours, and low light conditions.
       6.8.1.5. The Fire Department will initiate reset operations. Barrier Maintenance will
       certify the barrier and assist Fire Department personnel with reset operations. NOTE:
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                55


      Barrier Maintenance‘s duty hours are 0730-1600, Monday-Friday, excluding down days.
      Expect extended delays outside of duty hours.
          6.8.1.5.1. Barrier Maintenance will conduct the post engagement inspection. After
          the inspection, the barrier will be returned to service.
          6.8.1.5.2. After duty hours, if the Barrier Maintenance stand-by person has not
          arrived by the time the Fire Department has completed the rewind process, the Fire
          Department will remove the cable from the RWY to allow airfield operations to
          resume.
6.9. Aircraft Impoundment Procedures.
   6.9.1. Notify Ops Sup that the aircraft may require impoundment.
   6.9.2. After landing, remain with aircraft, if practical, until debriefed by the investigation
   team.
   6.9.3. For flight control malfunctions, leave the engine running, if possible, until
   maintenance specialists arrive to investigate the problem.
   6.9.4. Ultimately, the decision to continue impoundment rests with Maintenance QA,
   squadron supervision, and the MXG/CC.
   6.9.5. Conditions for Aircraft Impoundment. Pilots will request impoundment procedures
   for the following conditions:
      6.9.5.1. Inadvertent release or firing of explosive ordnance or training devices.
      6.9.5.2. When a serious flight control malfunction is reported. ―Serious‖ is defined as
      any malfunction that has the potential to jeopardize flight safety.
      6.9.5.3. When in-flight performance of the aircraft is such that further operation of it
      could result in loss of life or aircraft.
      6.9.5.4. Engine stall/flameout.
      6.9.5.5. Any physiological incident.
      6.9.5.6. Serious repeat/recurring discrepancies.
      6.9.5.7. When suspected or actual foreign object damage (FOD) occurs.
      6.9.5.8. When a missing tool or item cannot be accounted for that was used to work on
      the aircraft in question.
      6.9.5.9. When investigation of the aircraft is required to gather evidence in support of
      aircraft mishap as defined in AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
      6.9.5.10. Anytime the 354 OG/CC or MXG/CC feel that extraordinary measures are
      needed to ensure the safe operating condition of a specific aircraft.
6.10. Airborne Incident Reporting. Reference 354 FW IFG.
   6.10.1. Give airborne reports to the controlling ATC facility or 354 SOF, as appropriate.
   Airborne incidents include:
 56                                                       354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


       6.10.1.1. Any known inadvertent release or loss of stores, suspension equipment,
       dropped objects, panels, or drag chute in flight.
       6.10.1.2. Any near mid-air collision involving civil aircraft.
       6.10.1.3. Any accident/incident requiring immediate dissemination to enhance flight
       safety.
   6.10.2. After landing, aircrew must immediately provide details of the incident to their
   squadron supervision (SQ/CC, SQ/DO, or Ops Sup) and flight safety.
6.11. Fuel Dump Procedures.
   6.11.1. Restrictions. During emergency fuel dumping, make every effort to dump at or
   above FL200, away from Federal Airways and in areas where spray will not settle on urban
   areas, agricultural regions, or water sources.
       6.11.1.1. North Area. Hold north of the EIL 003/35 fix, 6 NM legs, left turns.
       6.11.1.2. South Area. Hold south of the EIL 163/35 fix, 6 NM legs, left turns.
   6.11.2. Reporting. The aircraft commander will ensure the data for the dump report is
   provided to the 354 FW Command Post as soon as possible after landing. Copies of the
   jettison report will be routed to the Base Fuels Management Flight (354 LRS/LGRF) for
   proper accounting. Aircraft commanders of major commands other than PACAF will make
   the notification required by their command.
6.12. Controlled Bailout/Off-Range Stores Jettison Area. The controlled bailout/jettison area
is west of the Tanana River (EIL 211/08). See Figure 4.14 VFR Traffic Patterns.
   6.12.1. If possible, aircrew should contact FAI ATCT and expect vectors. FAI ATCT will
   provide IFR separation from other aircraft.
   6.12.2. If unable contact with FAI ATCT (lost communication/NORDO), aircrews strive to
   maintain VFR and proceed to the EIL 211/08 by the most direct route. Bailout or release at
   or above 3,000‘ MSL as the aircraft passes the west bank of the Tanana River on a southwest
   heading. Consider westerly winds that may blow the parachute back towards the Tanana
   River.
   6.12.3. Tower will broadcast on 352.05/127.2 and 243.0/121.5 that a controlled bailout or
   jettison is in progress. They will direct all aircraft to remain clear of the area. In addition,
   Tower will activate the PCAS to alert 210 RQS rescue operations.
6.13. Downed Aircraft and Search and Rescue (SAR) Procedures. Reference 354 FW IFG.
   6.13.1. Initial On-Scene Commander (OSC) will be the first pilot witnessing the downed
   aircraft. Multiple factors must be weighed when establishing subsequent OSC duties (i.e.
   available fuel, communications capability, experience, FAC-A qualified, targeting pod
   availability, local area knowledge, etc.) 11 AF Rescue Control Center (RCC) can be
   contacted directly on VHF 123.1 or through ATC, Eielson Range Control, or TOP ROCC.
   Notify the SOF ASAP of any downed aircraft. Consider coordinating for launch of the
   Eielson Alert Tanker or using the Reliability Tanker, if applicable, to extend OSC time on-
   station.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                57


   6.13.2. It is critical to immediately coordinate SAR assets in environmental conditions where
   ambient temperatures below -20F ECT are prevalent. Do NOT delay notification of
   SOF/Command Post or SAR assets for any reason. The survivor‘s life depends on
   expeditious coordination and timely execution of recovery. Initial shock and recovery from
   cold injuries may prevent survivors from taking actions to protect themselves.
   6.13.3. Aircrews shall broadcast an emergency distress call on Guard. Then, provide the
   following information to Eielson Range Control, FAI ATCT, Anchorage Center, 354 FW/CP
   or the SOF:
       6.13.3.1. Location of the crash site (TACAN Radial/DME, INS coordinates, geographic
       references).
       6.13.3.2. Call sign of downed aircraft.
       6.13.3.3. Time of ejection/downed aircraft.
       6.13.3.4. Other pertinent information.
   6.13.4. Eielson Range Control shall have all nonessential aircraft RTB/leave the vicinity.
   The OSC may request nonessential aircraft establish a high combat air patrol to provide a
   radio relay.
   6.13.5. Eielson Range Control will assist the Rescue Coordination Center for all SAR inside
   the JPARC for DoD assets. Anchorage Center will provide all air traffic control services.
   6.13.6. Contact the downed aircrew on Guard and then coordinate a discrete frequency
   change.
6.14. Response to Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Signals.
   6.14.1. Aircrews will inform appropriate air traffic control agencies upon detection of an
   emergency signal and assist in locating the source if possible.
   6.14.2. Control Tower will:
       6.14.2.1. Upon detection or notification of a signal, contact Anchorage Center to
       determine if a possible emergency exists and if assistance is required.
       6.14.2.2. Advise AMOPS of the time a signal was detected and the frequency.
       6.14.2.3. Advise AMOPS and Anchorage Center upon termination of the signal.
   6.14.3. 354 MXG/MOCC, 353 CTS/MOCC, and 168 ARW/MOCC will assist in locating
   ELT signal originating from PAEI. 71st Civil Air Patrol (71 CAP) and 210 RQS will assist
   in locating ELT signals in the local areas.
6.15. Weather Recall. Weather recalls are initiated by the SOF. Eielson Range Control will
broadcast a weather recall on Guard, using all repeaters. Aircrews will terminate the mission and
contact the SOF for instructions.
6.16. Lightning within 5 NMs procedures. Operations in the vicinity of thunderstorms are
IAW AFI 11-202V3. Tower/Ground will notify all aircraft if lightning has been observed within
5 NMs of PAEI. Pilots will adhere to the following procedures.
   6.16.1. Ground procedures. Arm and de-arm operations will cease immediately. Armed
   aircraft may takeoff if the thunderstorms can be avoided. De-armed aircraft will hold in EOR
 58                                                       354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


   until the lightning warning has expired. Aircraft in a fuel critical state will contact SOF, Ops
   Sup, or ground control for further guidance. Fuel critical aircraft are permitted to taxi to
   chocks with 354 OG/CC or SOF approval. The OG/CC, SOF, or tower WS will coordinate
   with MXG/CC for a waiver to permit ground crews to catch aircraft requiring immediate
   shutdown. Maintenance actions will be approved by MXG/CC on a case-by-case basis.
   Once shutdown, aircrews will remain in the aircraft until the lightning warning has expired.
   NOTE: F-16s may be required to shutdown without a pinned EPU. In this case, pilots will
   turn the EPU off to prevent inadvertent EPU activation in the event of a WOW switch failure
   when the throttle is placed to off.
   6.16.2. Flight procedures. Flights airborne will contact the SOF/AIRBOSS for guidance and
   conserve fuel. SOF will determine if conditions warrant recovery to PAEI, holding, or divert
   to an alternate airfield. Aircraft unable to hold or divert will land and follow ground
   procedures IAW 6.16.1. Pilots will exercise extra caution due to hazardous conditions
   associated with landing in the vicinity of thunderstorms.
6.17. BASH. Local Bird/Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program Guidelines are IAW 354
FW/168 ARW BASH PLAN 91-212.              Reference Attachment 11 BIRD HAZARD
PROCEDURES.
6.18. Request for Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Assistance. Any request for EOD
support to aircraft loaded with munitions or aircraft weapon systems will require the aircraft be
shut down prior to EOD personnel approaching the aircraft.
6.19. Unauthorized Aircraft Landing/Unscheduled Aircraft Movements. Procedures are
located in the PAEI Full-Spectrum Contingency Plan, AFI 10-1001, Civil Landing Permits, and
AFI 10-1801, Foreign Governmental Aircraft landings at United States Air Force Installations.
6.20. Air Evacuation Notification and Response Procedures. AMOPS will notify Tower,
Transient Alert, Command Post, Air Terminal Operations Center, and Med Group, of all Air
Evacuation operations.
6.21. Backup Power. All Eielson ATCALS facilities are equipped with auto-start auxiliary
generators or battery backups. NOTE: When auto-transfer is not available, back-up generators
will commence operations 30 minutes before the estimated arrival of severe weather. When
NAVAIDs are placed on generator power, 354 CS/MOC will notify Control Tower.
6.22. Aircraft Bomb Threats.
   6.22.1. Control Tower will:
       6.22.1.1. Activate the PCAS and transmit all available information.
       6.22.1.2. Notify the pilot of a bomb threat aircraft if the information did not come
       directly from the suspect aircraft.
       6.22.1.3. If the bomb threat aircraft is on the ground, direct the aircraft to the departure
       end of the RWY in use avoiding all other aircraft and congested areas.
       6.22.1.4. If the bomb threat aircraft is still airborne, give emergency landing priority.
       6.22.1.5. Ensure all other taxiing and airborne aircraft are advised of appropriate
       emergency information.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                             59

Terms
Airfield Check—Conducted by Airfield Management personnel to the examine the primary
takeoff, landing and taxi surfaces in response to in-flight or ground emergencies, Runway
Surface Condition or Runway Condition Reading assessments, Foreign Object Damage removal,
and for Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazards and Habitat control.
Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI)—Formerly known as the flight line driving instruction.
Establishes local procedures for driving a vehicle on the airfield.
Airfield Inspection—Conducted by Airfield Management personnel to identify discrepancies
and/or hazards on the airfield (e.g., signs, markings, lighting, pavements, aircraft arresting
system, obstructions, obstacles, construction areas, etc.).
Airfield Operating Hours—AO facilities remain open to support the base flying mission.
MAJCOM/A3 establishes airfield operating hours. The OG/CC may authorize the use of
standby and on-call procedures for AO facilities. The OG/CC may extend operating hours at
bases where facilities are open less than 24 hours per day, as required, to meet short-term
mission requirements.
Airfield Operations Instruction (AOI)—Formerly known as the base flying regulation.
Defines local procedures for Airfield Management and ATC.
Approach End of Runway (AER)—The end of a runway nearest to the direction from which
the final approach is made.
Chase Aircraft—An aircraft flown in close proximity to another aircraft normally to observe its
performance during training or testing.
Closed Airfield—An airfield is "closed" when no flying activity is permitted. Unless
NOTAM‗d otherwise, an airfield is considered closed during periods outside of normal
published operating hours when essential services are not available. If the closure is for a
particular type of aircraft or operation, it must be so stated. For example: "Closed to aircraft not
involved in RED FLAG-Alaska exercises."
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)—Any portion of the airfield requiring aircraft, vehicles
and pedestrians to obtain specific Air Traffic Control approval for access. Controlled Movement
Areas include but are not limited to areas used for takeoff, landing and as required taxiing of
aircraft. NOTE: This definition is used in lieu of "movement area" as defined in the FAA Pilot
Controller Glossary.
External Stores—Items mounted on the external portions of an aircraft (e.g., armament, fuel
tanks, baggage pods, etc.) that can be released or jettisoned from an aircraft.
Flightline—Any area or facility including apron, hardstand and ramps on or in which aircraft
may be parked, stored, serviced or maintained.
Foreign Object Damage Check—Conducted by AM personnel prior to the start of normal
flying activities or in response to FOD reports by SOF, control Tower, aircraft, etc.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    67


Flight—More than one aircraft which, by prior arrangement between the pilots, operates as a
single aircraft with regard to navigation and position reporting. Separation between aircraft
within the formation is the responsibility of the flight lead and the pilots of the other aircraft in
the flight. This includes transition periods when aircraft within the formation are maneuvering to
attain separation from each other to effect individual control and during join-up and breakaway.
Holding Hands—Aircraft are joined in formation, implies visual contact by all flight members.
Lighting Check—Conducted by Civil Engineering (electrician) or AM personnel during periods
of darkness (including pre-dawn and dusk) to determine the operability of airfield lighting
systems.
Local Operating Procedures—Supplemental procedures issued as letters of agreement,
operations letters, operating instructions, memorandum of understanding, squadron regulations,
operations plans, or base manual or instructions.
Official Business Only (OBO)—The airfield is closed to all transient military aircraft for the
purpose of obtaining routine services such as fueling, passenger drop off or pickup, practice
approaches, parking, etc. The airfield may be used by aircrews and aircraft if official
government business (including civilian) must be conducted on or near the airfield and Prior
Permission is received from the Airfield Management.
On-Call Time—AO personnel must remain in the local area and be able to be contacted in the
event it becomes necessary to man their respective duty section(s) outside of normal operating
hours. Personnel who are on-call must not consume alcohol or take medications that affect duty
status. Do not consider on-call time as duty time.
Open Airfield—Unless NOTAM‘d closed, an airfield is considered open during published
operating hours with all essential services available.
Prior Permission Required (PPR)—The airfield is closed to transient aircraft unless approval
for operation is obtained from the appropriate commander through Airfield Management. PPR
must be requested and approved before the flight departs to that airfield. The purpose of PPR is
to control volume and flow of traffic rather than to prohibit it. Prior permission is required for
all aircraft requiring transient alert service outside the published transient alert duty hours. All
aircraft carrying hazardous materials must obtain prior permission as outlined in AFJI 11-204.
Runway Condition Reading (RCR)—A numerical reading that identifies the surface friction
capability of the runway pavement, obtained using a decelerometer. The aircrew uses this
information to determine runway braking action during takeoffs and landings.
Runway Incursion—Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and
takeoff of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.
These are further classified into three operational categories:
Operational Error (OE)—A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of
separation.
Pilot Deviation (PD)—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC instructions,
AFIs and/or FARs.
 68                                                      354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation (V/PD)—Any entry or movement on the controlled movement
area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not been
authorized by ATC.
Runway Surface Condition (RSC)—Identifies the condition of the runway surface when
covered with slush, snow, ice or water.
Runway Suspension—A short-term condition that requires temporarily restricting aircraft
arrivals and departures until corrected (e.g. FOD, severe bird/wildlife activity, snow and ice
removal checks, arresting systems maintenance/configuration changes, airfield construction,
pavement repair, etc.).
Standby Time—Time during published flying hours when AO personnel are immediately
available to return the facility to operations within the time limit the OG/CC specifies. Consider
standby time as duty time.
Supervisor of Flying—A rated officer authorized by the flying unit commander to monitor and
supervise current flight operations. A Supervisor of Flying may perform duties from the control
Tower.
Unauthorized Landing—A landing at an Air Force airfield by a civil aircraft without prior
authority (approved DD Form 2401 and 24 hours prior notice).
Uncontrolled Movement Areas—Taxiways and ramp areas not under the control of ATC.
NOTE: This definition is used in lieu of "non-movement area" as defined in the Federal
Aviation Administration Pilot Controller Glossary.
Wet Runway—An RSC where visible water is the only form of moisture on the runway surface.

                                    PAEI PARKING PLAN

A2.1. Purpose. To establish local procedures for aircraft parking, and to formalize parking
rows and apron use in support of the daily flying mission and maintenance operations.
A2.2. Responsibilities. The 354 OG/CC is responsible and maintains final authority for all
ramps and parking rows. Specific rows and ramps are assigned to local organizations. The
primary users of parking rows and ramps are listed below. See Figure A2.2 for parking row
locations.
   A2.2.1. Nose Dock 1 is assigned to Detachment 1, 210 RQS.
   A2.2.2. Nose Dock 2 is assigned to the 71st Composite Squadron, Civil Air Patrol.
   A2.2.3. The Thunder Dome is a multi-use hangar facility controlled by 353 CTS.
   A2.2.4. Parking Rows Papa, Quebec, Romeo, and Sierra are transient parking areas for
   fighters. When aircraft are parked on Papa or Romeo Rows, resultant available wingtip
   clearance(s) may restrict the use of Taxiway F. Appropriate NOTAMs will be published
   indicating the max wing span allowed.
   A2.2.5. Tanker Row includes Spots 11-22, of which Spots 11-19 are normally assigned to
   the 168 ARW. NOTE: Aircraft will not taxi behind tankers.
   A2.2.6. Distinguished Visitor (DV) spots 1, 2 and 3, located directly in front of Base
   Operations, can accommodate up to three aircraft, each no larger than a VC-135.
   A2.2.7. Lima Row can accommodate non-heavy aircraft, to include helicopters.
   A2.2.8. Hangars 1227 & 1228 can accommodate fighters, small DV aircraft, or helicopters,
   and are assigned to the 353 CTS.
   A2.2.9. Oscar Row is used for transient aircraft and is certified for fighter hot-pit operations.
   A2.2.10. The 8-bay/4-bay area accommodates fighters and is assigned to the 18th Aggressor
   Squadron (18 AGRS).
   A2.2.11. The South Loop accommodates fighters and helicopters and will normally be used
   for live ordnance loading and large force exercise overflow parking.
   A2.2.12. South Ramp can accommodate (16) C-17 sized or (8) C-5 sized or (72) F-16 sized
   aircraft. B-52s are restricted from this ramp due to wingtip clearances and weight
   restrictions. Type III Fuel-Hydrants are available. The South Ramp is a designated hot-pit
   area. The Airfield Manager assigns parking in this area.
A2.3. Ramp Parking Scheduling. All ramp parking is scheduled by AMOPS. Organizations
requiring ramp parking will contact AMOPS for parking space assignment.

                               HELICOPTER OPERATIONS

A3.1. Introduction. This attachment provides procedural guidance, training restrictions and
general information pertinent to helicopter operations at PAEI. This attachment is not a single
source document and must be used in conjunction with unit standard operating procedures (SOP)
and policy directives. If a perceived conflict exists between this chapter and other applicable
publications, the most restrictive guidance applies. Flight procedures changes of an immediate
nature are in the FCIF, Operations Read File (ORF) and the Aircrew Information File (AIF).
A3.2. General. Helicopters may arrive/depart Eielson from the RWY (preferred for flight
safety), Taxiway A, B, and F (north of the Thunder Dome). The use of taxiways for
departure/landings is intended only to minimize fixed-wing aircraft arrival/departure delays.
A3.3. Taxiway F. Aircraft will contact Eielson Ground with: call sign, ATIS information,
location, and departure intentions. Aircraft will taxi/hover taxi to Taxiway F. Aircraft will
contact Control Tower for departure clearance. NOTE: Taxiway F is not an approved helipad.
Departures/arrivals will be at the pilot‘s own risk.

Figure A3.1. Moose Creek Arrival/Departure




A3.4. Helicopter Departure/Arrival Routes. Departure routes are detailed below. For
arrivals, aircraft will fly the reverse of the departure routing. If other routings are desired,
 72                                                      354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


coordinate with Control Tower. The departures listed are not for use in IMC use; they are
strictly VMC procedures. Aircrews are responsible for terrain/obstacle avoidance.
   A3.4.1. Moose Creek Departure: Departures shall turn to a heading of 340 once the aircraft
   is 200‘ AGL to provide course divergence from the RWY. Aircraft shall remain east of the
   RWY.
       A3.4.1.1. Moose Creek North: Upon reaching the Alaskan pipeline, aircraft will turn left
       to a heading of 320 degrees and exit the Class Delta Surface Area before maneuvering
       further.
       A3.4.1.2. Moose Creek South: Upon reaching the Alaskan pipeline, aircraft will turn
       right and follow the pipeline until clear of the Loop Taxiway then (prior to the small arms
       impact area) turn to a heading of 220 degrees and exit the Class Delta Surface Area
       before maneuvering further.
   A3.4.2. South Departure: If fixed wing traffic is not a factor, helicopters may climb to
   1,000‘ MSL while crossing the RWY from their lift-off location and head 190 degrees until
   clear of the Class Delta Surface Area.
A3.5. Traffic Pattern. Helicopters remaining in the traffic pattern to perform functional check
flights shall operate at or below 1,000‘ MSL unless approved higher by Control Tower.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                              73


                                       Attachment 4
                                 AIRCRAFT SPECIFICS

A4.1. F-16 SPECIFICS
  A4.1.1. Fuel Requirements. Due to single RWY operations, pilots will add a minimum of
  200 pounds to AFI 11-2F-16V3, F-16--Operations Procedures, normal recovery fuels. The
  354 FW IFG lists recommended Block 30 VFR/IFR bingo and divert fuels. Flight leads will
  brief the assumptions and routing they used to calculate the flight‘s Joker and Bingo fuels.
     A4.1.1.1. Pilots will recover with a minimum of 1,200 lbs (Block 30 F-16)/1,400 lbs
     (Block 40/50 F-16) on initial or at the FAF when the airfield status is VFR. Pilots will
     recover with IFR divert fuel at the IAF when the airfield status requires an alternate as
     directed by the SOF. Reference the divert/alternate fuel pages of the 354 FW IFG for
     standard fuels from selected areas. NOTE: All fuels are calculated for Block 30 F-16s
     only.
  A4.1.2. Required Equipment. The following are required, in addition to those listed in AFI
  11-202, Vol. 3 and AFI 11-2MDS, Vol. 3:
     A4.1.2.1. An operational Identification Friend or Foe and Selective Identification
     Feature (IFF/SIF), Mode 3 and C, is required for all single aircraft flights. At least one
     aircraft in each flight must have an operational IFF/SIF.
     A4.1.2.2. Both the main Attitude Director Indicator (ADI) and standby ADI must be
     operative prior to night flying or when actual instrument conditions are anticipated.
     A4.1.2.3. For night missions, taxi and landing lights.
  A4.1.3. Go/No Go Procedures. All pilots must be current on all training events listed as
  ―grounding‖ IAW AFI 11-2F-16V1. In addition, all pilots must be current on the latest
  Flight Crew Information File (FCIF), Critical Action Procedures (CAPS), and annual FCIF
  review. SARMs will not release aircraft tail numbers until they have ensured pilot currency.
     A4.1.3.1. All pilots will accomplish a monthly CAPS exam prior to their first flight of
     the month. Pilots failing the CAPS exam will be retested until a 100 percent score is
     achieved prior to flying. Squadron Ops Sup is the approval authority for allowing a pilot
     to fly after failing and successfully retaking a test.
     A4.1.3.2. Pilots will not fly unless they have a current date for a SEPT. Accomplishing a
     SEPT on any day in one month, allows the pilot to fly until the end of the following
     month. Pilots will utilize the Unit Training Device (UTD) to the maximum extent
     possible to accomplish SEPT training. Additionally, Stan/Eval will develop scenarios to
     tailor SEPTs and to guide pilots through various emergency procedures. Pilots will use
     the SEPT scenarios to complete monthly SEPTs.
  A4.1.4. Preflight. Ensure FOD-free and ice-free AOA probes, pitot tube, and air data probes
  prior to engine start.
  A4.1.5. Engine Start. SEC and EPU checks are done in the chocks prior to activating
  avionics. The SEC check will be done before the EPU check and the EPU pin will remain in
  until after the SEC check is complete to preclude EPU activation in the event of SEC
 74                                                     354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


   malfunctions/flameouts. During Hot Pit operations, accomplish the EPU check prior to
   exiting the pits.
   A4.1.6. Taxi.     Taxi spacing is 150‘ staggered during normal operations else 300‘ on
   centerline.
      A4.1.6.1. Low Fuel During Taxi. If fuel becomes critical during taxi (i.e., after
      illumination of either fuel low caution light), monitor the fuel reservoirs. Plan to be
      stopped, chocked, have the EPU pinned, and shut down in a ground control/SOF-
      approved area before the total fuel in the reservoirs reaches 600 lbs (F-16s). Do not enter
      hot pits if EPU will not be pinned before 600 lbs remaining (F-16s).
   A4.1.7. Takeoff
      A4.1.7.1. Below 0°F (-18°C), mil power will be used for takeoff unless planned takeoff
      distance exceeds 50% of runway for a mil power takeoff.
   A4.1.8. Simulated Flameout (SFO) Patterns. The Overhead SFO, Glider SFO, or Direct
   West Low Key patterns may be flown by locally assigned F-16 aircraft or TDY aircraft with
   a local area orientation from 354 OGV. SFOs will be approved on a traffic permitting basis
   and will terminate in a low approach. Control tower may disapprove or instruct pilots to
   discontinue an SFO at anytime.
      A4.1.8.1. The reported ceiling must be 1000 feet above the highest altitude to be flown
      and flight/ground visibility must be at least 5 SM.
      A4.1.8.2. When the small arms range is hot, aircraft will not over fly it below 3,500 feet
      AGL. Note: If the CATM range is hot for .50 caliber firings, AMOPS will issue a
      NOTAM: EIELSON SMALL ARMS RANGE IS HOT SURFACE TO 6,500 feet AGL.

       A4.1.8.4. Traffic conflict information will be issued by tower to SFO aircraft.
       Glider/SFO aircraft will report any preceding traffic ―in sight‖ before departing Low Key
       or break out.
       A4.1.8.5. Break out procedures. If instructed to breakout from any SFO, aircraft will
       remain at or above 3,500 feet MSL and reenter via SALLY/NANCY/ESTER per the
       VFR traffic pattern procedures or request climb back to High Key or Glider High.
       A4.1.8.6. Overhead SFO Pattern. On initial contact with tower or from a low approach,
       pilots will ―Request SFO" from Tower. At departure end, aircraft will initiate a climbing
       turn to the west to an altitude between 4,000 and 9,500 feet MSL. While climbing,
       aircraft will then roll out and fly the inside downwind ground track parallel to the runway
       to a point approximately 1 NM past the approach end of the runway. At that point,
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                              77


     aircraft will execute a 180 degree turn to the east to enter the Overhead SFO, over the
     active runway. The overhead SFO is a racetrack pattern with right hand turns for RWY
     32 and left hand turns for RWY 14. If instructed, aircraft will orbit High Key to the east
     of the runway. Aircraft will remain within 3 NM of the runway.
     A4.1.8.7. Glider SFO Pattern: Glider SFOs are initiated from any cardinal direction
     from Eielson or any VFR reporting point, 7 to 10 NM out, in the block 4,000-9,500 feet
     MSL. Pilots should request ―Glider SFO‖ from Fairbanks Approach (or from Tower if
     already in contact). Upon approval for ―Glider SFO,‖ aircraft will report "Glider High"
     with cardinal direction or VFR reporting point. When instructed to report ―Glider Low,‖
     aircraft will proceed to a modified Base Key on either the east or west side of the runway
     and report "Glider Low" 3-5 NM from the runway and no lower than 3,500 feet MSL.
     A4.1.8.8. Direct West Low Key. From low approach, pilots may request Direct West
     Low Key. If approved by Tower, pilots will begin a climbing turn to the west to arrive at
     West Low Key no lower than 3,500‘ MSL. The Low Key to Base Key pattern will be on
     the west side of the airfield.

            UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEM (UAS) DIVERT PROCEDURES

A5.1. Overview. NASA lists PAEI as a divert field for their Global Hawk missions that over
fly the Arctic Circle. If they cannot file a divert field, they cannot launch. Global Hawk divert
options are severely limited due to FAA restrictions placed on them in relation to the National
Airspace System.
A5.2. Procedures. NASA‘s Global Hawk flights will be flown above Class A airspace. NASA
primarily uses autonomous flights with the Global Hawk flying preprogrammed coordinates. A
remote pilot will always be available during Global Hawk flights in NASA‘s Operations Center.
During a contingency, the remote pilot can talk with ATC agencies on a real time basis via
SATCOM relay.
A5.3. Notification Procedures.
   A5.3.1. NASA will notify:
       A5.3.1.1. Airfield Management, Eielson Command Post, and FAI ATCT a minimum of
       48 hours prior to any mission scheduled.
       A5.3.1.2. Airfield Management, Eielson Command Post, and FAI ATCT in the event of
       a Global Hawk emergency landing requiring Eielson‘s airfield.
       A5.3.1.3. Airfield Management when their runway will no longer be utilized for an
       emergency landing site (i.e. mission complete, emergency corrected, change of
       emergency landing site).
   A5.3.2. Eielson will notify:
       A5.3.2.1. NASA of Eielson airfield‘s readiness at least 48 hours prior to scheduled
       missions.
       A5.3.2.2. Transient Alert (TA) and Crash Recovery of scheduled missions and estimated
       time over station.
A5.4. Landing/Parking at Eielson. Global Hawk, if able will land and power down on the
runway. NOTE: Aircraft Arresting Systems must be disconnected prior to landing. TA has been
trained to safe the Global Hawk with the on-board kit. TA can tow the Global Hawk with a
universal tow bar. The Global Hawk will be assigned hangar space on a real time basis. 353
CTS/ES will be the POC for coordinating the release of hangar space.
A5.5. UAS Flight Ops.
   A5.5.1. NASA will dispatch a recovery team as soon as possible.
   A5.5.2. If the Global Hawk can be repaired and flown, the team will coordinate with Airfield
   Management and the FAA for a departure routing and flight plan.
   A5.5.3. If the Global Hawk cannot be repaired and flown, the team will dismantle the
   aircraft and arrange shipment.

                    PAEI BARRIER CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES

A6.1. Purpose. To outline procedures for barrier maintenance to request barrier certification
from the Airfield Manager.
A6.2. Responsibilities. Pilots requested to perform practice cable engagements (for barrier
certification or operational exercise/inspection only) need 354 OG/CC approval. Coordinate
with the SOF for timing and certification requirements. The Airfield Manager/Deputy Airfield
Manager (or designated representative) will:
   A6.2.1. Review barrier certification and maintenance records and coordinate with 18 AGRS
   for scheduling of barrier certification.
   A6.2.2. Notify the agencies in Table A6.2.2. of the aircraft type and call sign prior to each
   engagement.

Crash Recovery (354 EMS/MXMTR)                   354 FW SOF (SOURDOUGH SOF)
A6.3. Procedures.
   A6.3.1. Prior to the engagement, the Airfield Manager and barrier maintenance will confirm
   the aircraft‘s gross weight with the aircraft commander and compute the engagement speed
   according to T.O. 35E8-2-1-101. The aircrew will target the engagement for the minimum
   airspeed in the target airspeed window.
   A6.3.2. The aircraft will be in a flyable condition, with the canopy closed and tail hook shear
   pin installed (F-16 only). Aircraft will be cleared into position and specifically cleared to
   engage the cable by Tower. Conduct certification on pre-coordinated frequency.
   A6.3.3. De-arm, if applicable, and lock shoulder harness.
   A6.3.4. The aircraft will stabilize engines at normal run-up parameters, release brakes, then
   track down the RWY and attempt to engage within 5 feet of RWY centerline. F-16 specifics
   include:
       A6.3.4.1. Use mil power (AB allowed for barrier certification). Select idle power prior
       to engaging the cable.
       A6.3.4.2. Select List 6 to obtain ground speed and use a maximum of 135 knots ground
       speed (Block 25, 30, and 32).
       A6.3.4.3. Place the hook down at least 1000 feet prior to the cable or before starting the
       engagement run. Engage the cable in the center with the nose wheel on the ground and
       feet off the brakes.
82                                                       354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


  A6.3.5. When crash recovery notifies the aircrew to disengage from the barrier, add power
  to roll forward, then throttle to idle to allow aircraft to roll back. Add power without braking
  to stop roll back. DO NOT USE WHEEL BRAKES.
  A6.3.6. Retract hook on signal from barrier crew. DO NOT USE ―SLINGSHOT‖
  PROCEDURES. Notify the Tower of call sign, tail number, actual airspeed, and gross
  weight. Taxi clear to the nearest de-arm area. Have the hook reset, if not previously
  accomplished, before taxiing to park. If taxiing the aircraft after a barrier certification is not
  possible, the aircraft will be shut down and towed off the RWY.
  A6.3.7. Do not fly the aircraft until maintenance realigns the hook shear pin.
  A6.3.8. Do not perform multiple practice engagements unless the hook shear pin is replaced
  between engagements.

                   REDUCED SAME RUNWAY SEPARATION (RSRS)

A8.1. Application. IAW PACAF LOA, RSRS standards (less than FAA JO 7110.65 standard
separation) apply to all PACAF assigned aircraft at PACAF bases where ATC is provided by
USAF controllers. 354 OG/CC will ensure all TDY units are familiar with RSRS application.
Control Tower shall attend and be available for questions during 353 CTS local familiarization
briefings or planning conferences.
A8.2. Conditions for application of RSRS standards.
   A8.2.1. Air traffic controllers must be able to see the participating aircraft and determine
   distances by reference to suitable landmarks (i.e. distance remaining markers or taxiways)
   during daytime and nighttime operations.
   A8.2.2. Any aircrew or air traffic controller may refuse RSRS. In these cases, appropriate
   separation standards published in FAA JO 7110.65 will apply.
   A8.2.3. Revert to nighttime RSRS standards when the RCR is reported to be ≤16 and ≥12, or
   when RCR reporting is not available or RSC is reported wet, ice on runway, or snow on
   runway.
   A8.2.4. Same fighter type aircraft means the same airframe (i.e. F-15 behind F-15, F-16
   behind F-16, etc).
   A8.2.5. Dissimilar fighter type aircraft means not the same airframe (i.e. F-15 behind F-16,
   F-16 behind A-10, etc).
   A8.2.6. Non-heavy, non-fighter type aircraft operations mean C-130, C-12, B-737, etc.
   A8.2.7. RSRS between members of a flight are authorized provided all aircraft involved are
   the same type aircraft (e.g. all F-15s, all F-16s, etc.) and request the same type of approach.
   Separation between aircraft within the formation is the responsibility of the flight lead and
   pilots of the other aircraft in the flight.
   A8.2.8. RSRS between flights is authorized. Separation between flights is measured
   between the trailing aircraft in the lead formation and the lead aircraft in the trailing
   formation.
A8.3. Conditions when RSRS standards DO NOT apply:
   A8.3.1. To any situation involving emergency aircraft.
   A8.3.2. To civil aircraft.
   A8.3.3. To air evacuation aircraft.
   A8.3.4. To touch-and-go behind full stop.
   A8.3.5. To ―heavy‖ aircraft.
   A8.3.6. When RCR is reported less than 12.

              SIMULATED AIRFIELD ATTACKS/USE OF VIPER A MOA

A10.1. LOWAT airfield attacks below 10,000’ MSL require 354 OG/CC approval. In
addition, the Viper A MOA must be NOTAM and scheduled through 354 OSS/OSCR. Contact
354 OSS/OSCR at 377-9327 NLT 24 hours prior to the intended use of the MOA to schedule a
simulated airfield attack. Viper A may be scheduled for only two 30-minute periods per day.
Deconflict scheduled periods with wing launch and recovery times. Viper A may be activated
for only 10 minutes during each window. Reference PAEI / Fairbanks Approach Letter of
Agreement (LOA).
A10.2. Viper A Restrictions.
   A10.2.1. Minimum Eielson weather: 1,500‘ ceiling and 3 SM visibility.
   A10.2.2. No chaff or flares.
   A10.2.3. Avoid overflight of base housing below 3,500‘ MSL and Small Arms Range below
   3,500‘ AGL when HOT.
   A10.2.4. Remain east of the Tanana River to deconflict from traffic holding to the west of
   the river.
A10.3. Procedures. Pilots executing ―Low‖ simulated airfield attacks (i.e., using Viper A) will
accomplish the following: Prior to step, notify the SOF/Tower of attack plan, intended Viper A
MOA activation times and exact TOT (for low altitude airfield attacks). Keep the SOF informed
of any changes to this time. NLT 5 minutes out, contact Tower for approval using the following
radio call, ―(Callsign), (number and type of aircraft), request activation of Viper A MOA for the
next ___minutes (10 minutes max)‖. Do not enter Class D airspace without Tower approval.
Adhere to off range attack restrictions per AFI 11-214. In the event of simultaneous attacks from
different flights, MARSA must be declared prior to entering the MOA and abide by the
following:
   A10.3.1. Remain in contact with Eielson Tower.
   A10.3.2. Report exiting Viper A MOA to Tower.
   A10.3.3. Maintain VMC and ―see and avoid‖.
   A10.3.4. Avoid all current noise/flight sensitive areas.
A10.4. Other Traffic. IFR aircraft may be permitted in the Viper A MOA when it is not
activated. During Viper A activation, IFR traffic will be held outside of the MOA until the
attack is complete. Eielson Tower will have control of all simulated airfield attack aircraft
operating in the Viper A MOA and will deny entry of civil VFR traffic into Class D airspace.
Departures and arrivals have priority over Viper A MOA activation. Tower or Fairbanks
Approach may cancel Viper A MOA activation at any time.

                              BIRD HAZARD PROCEDURES

A11.1. Bird Hazard Procedures. Reference 354 FW/168 ARW BASH PLAN 91-212. PAEI
and the surrounding local area experience intense bird activity during migratory periods. The
354 FW SOF is the single POC who ultimately determines the active Bird Watch Condition
(BWC). Exemptions to BWC/BASH restrictions require 354 OG/CC approval through the SOF
or tower watch supervisor (if SOF not on duty). All 354 FW Pilots and Aircrew (both assigned
and TDY) will adhere to the following procedures.
   A11.1.1. All pilots and aircrew are required to review the 354 FW Avian Hazard Advisory
   System (AHAS) Unit Web Page (http://www.usahas.com; select ―Units‖, then ―354 FW‖
   from the drop down menu, then click the ―Table‖ button) during their mission planning for
   any operations planned below 5,000 ft AGL.
   A11.1.2. Squadron Ops Sup/AIRBOSS brief the current AHAS Risk Level for the airspace
   scheduled to be used to all pilots/aircrew at the mass briefing and will update the
   pilots/aircrews at step time of any pertinent AHAS changes.
   A11.1.3. SOFs will review the 354 FW AHAS Unit Web Page to aid in determining the
   BWC for the 354 FW Airspace and communicate changes in BWC to pilots/aircrew and
   AIRBOSS via SOF/ATC frequencies and/or Eielson Range Control.
   A11.1.4. Based on current system limitations, the 354 FW will not solely use AHAS data to
   determine the BWC in MOAs and restricted areas. Rather, AHAS data will be used as a
   decision aid for SOFs (or Base Ops if a SOF is not on duty) to determine the BWC of MOAs,
   restricted areas, and the Eielson Pattern. AHAS will not be a substitute for reported or
   observed bird activity.
   A11.1.5. Pilot Reporting. Report any hazardous bird activity in MOAs, low-level routes,
   and ranges to the SOF and/or Range Control as soon as possible using the following format:
   Callsign, location, altitude of birds, local time sighted, approximate number of birds, type of
   bird (if known).
A11.2. Birdwatch Conditions (BWC). Pilots will take the following actions during declared
―Birdwatch‖ conditions IAW 354 FWI 91-212.
   A11.2.1. BWC – Low. Normal bird activity on or above airfield/area with a low probability
   of hazard. No deviation from normal procedures is required.
   A11.2.2. BWC – Moderate. Increased bird population in locations, which represents an
   increased potential for strike.
       A11.2.2.1. Low levels. Minimum altitude 1,000‘ AGL on affected route segments or
       course deviation as required.
       A11.2.2.2. Ranges. Flight leads will change events as required to avoid bird activity.
       Minimum altitude is 1,000‘ AGL.
       A11.2.2.3. PAEI Pattern. Traffic will be limited to the initial takeoffs and full-stop
       landings. Multiple patterns require 354 OG/CC approval through the SOF and are
       limited to the minimum required to fulfill training requirements. Fighter formation
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                              91


       takeoffs, chase, or interval takeoffs with less than 10 seconds of spacing and formation
       landings are prohibited. If approved, low approaches are restricted to 500‘ AGL.
   A11.2.3. BWC – Severe. High bird population on or immediately above the runway or other
   specific location(s) that represents high potential for strike. BWC - Severe is required
   anytime any large bird or concentrations of birds above or in the vicinity of runway (within
   100 feet) or in arrival/departure zones; flocking birds crossing within 1nm of runway ends;
   any reported bird strike in Class D airspace; large concentrations of birds in the BEZ; any
   time bird dispersal is conducted in the BEZ; or bird levels are at concentrations in the BEZ
   greater than BWC MODERATE.
       A11.2.3.1. Low levels. Low level routes reported as BWC - Severe are canceled for the
       day.
       A11.2.3.2. Ranges. Limited to employment above 5,000‘ AGL until the SOF/RCO
       determines the severe bird hazard no longer exists.
       A11.2.3.3. PAEI Pattern. All takeoffs, patterns, and landings require 354 OG/CC
       approval, except in case of emergency. Only full stop landings are authorized.
       Formation/chased takeoffs and landings are prohibited except in the case of an
       emergency.
   A11.2.4. Practice emergency approach procedures will only be flown during BWC - Low.
A11.3. BASH Phase Periods I and II. BASH Phase Periods will be declared by 354 FW
Safety and announced by 354 OG/OGV through 354 FW FCIF. The FCIF will implement
BASH as a 354 FW Special Interest Item (SII). BASH Phase II is normally declared during
migratory seasons. Significantly increased local bird activity statistically occurs 15 April-15
May and 15 August-20 September.
   A11.3.1. BASH Phase I. Normal Operations. During BASH Phase I, all areas are initially
   ―Birdwatch Condition - Low‖ by default until declared to be at a higher level.
   A11.3.2. BASH Phase II (Migratory Season). During BASH Phase II, all ranges, low levels,
   MOAs, and PAEI traffic pattern are BWC – Moderate by default. Apply BWC – Moderate
   procedures IAW paragraph A11.2.2 above. In addition, implement the following:
       A11.3.2.1. Remain vigilant of bird activity and report hazardous bird conditions
       immediately to the SOF/tower watch supervisor.
       A11.3.2.2. Fly no lower than 5,000‘ AGL during incentive flights except for departures
       and landings.
       A11.3.2.3. Perform only full-stop landings within +/- 1 hour of sunrise/sunset.
       A11.3.2.4. PAEI traffic pattern. 354 FW SOF or ATC WS can lower the BWC to ―Low‖
       in PAEI pattern based on observed bird activity. SOFs and watch supervisors will remain
       vigilant of bird activity and immediately institute BWC - Moderate or Severe as bird
       activity warrants.

                              KC-135 TACTICAL ARRIVAL

A12.1. General. The procedures herein are established for aircraft arriving PAEI assigned to
the 168 ARW.
   A12.1.1. Tactical maneuvers will be flown VFR.
   A12.1.2. Minimum weather requirement: ceiling 500 feet above the requested altitude, 3
   miles visibility.
   A12.1.3. May be flown at night as a single ship only. No other aircraft may be in the
   pattern.
   A12.1.5. KC-135 tactical procedures will not be conducted simultaneously in any
   combination: Min-Risk arrival or departure, Curvilinear Approach and Overhead/Glider
   SFO approaches. 168 ARW tactical aircraft procedures will not cause a delay to 354 FW
   aircraft departures or recoveries.
A12.2. Procedure.
   A12.2.1. Curvilinear Approach. Remain at or below 10,000 MSL (or as directed by ATC).
   Conduct all operations within the lateral confines of Eielson‘s Class D surface area.
   A12.2.2. Request a Curvilinear Approach from FAI ATCT.
   A12.2.3. Aircrew will advise FAI ATCT once the airfield or runway is in sight.
   A12.2.4. Cancel IFR with FAI ATCT no later than 7 DME from PAEI. NOTE: The aircrew
   must cancel IFR for the VFR tactical arrival.
   A12.2.5. Contact PAEI tower with requested arrival and type landing.
   A12.2.6. Commence a spiraling VFR descent to the RWY. Maneuver southwest for normal
   base turn to final. Configure normally and position the aircraft on a stabilized final NLT
   300‘ AGL and 1 NM from the threshold. NOTE: EIL tower should make every effort to
   avoid imposing altitude restrictions as they will degrade the training value of this maneuver.

                             MISCELLANEOUS PROCEDURES

A15.1. Flight Following Procedures.
   A15.1.1. Locally Assigned Fighter Arrival/Departure Times. The SOF tracks 354 FW daily
   flying departure and arrival times in Patriot Excalibur (PEX). TDY units hosted by 354 FW
   units are considered locally assigned. If PEX is out of service, Airfield Management
   Operations (AMOPS) will pass the times to the 354 FW Command Post (CP).
   A15.1.2. Transient Aircraft Arrival/Departure Times. Tower will pass all arrival/departure
   times of transient aircraft to AMOPS. AMOPS will pass arrival and departure times of
   transient aircraft to CP, ATOC, and TA.. The CP is responsible for tracking all departures
   and arrivals of aircraft with mission numbers loaded in Global Decision Support System II
   (GDSS2).
A15.2. Recurring NAVAID Preventative Maintenance Schedule. NOTAM (Notice to
Airmen) and Navigational Aids (NAVAID) preventative maintenance inspection (PMI)
schedules are published in the Alaskan Supplement. During periods of daylight savings time,
effective hours will be one hour earlier than shown and will be indicated by a ―++‖ symbol
following the hours indicated. If a PMI is required outside of the NOTAM times, Airfield
Systems (354 CS/SCOA) must prior coordinate with Airfield Operations (354 OSS/OSA) to gain
354 OG/CC approval. ATC will not release NAVAIDs for PMI when the ceiling is less than
3,000‘ MSL or visibility is less than 5 SM or forecasted below these minimums.
A15.3. Organizational Responsibilities- Reopening Eielson Airfield Following a Period of
Closure.
   A15.3.1. Eielson ATC, AMOPS, and Weather Personnel:
       A15.3.1.1. Provide on-call recall letters to CP NLT 72 hours prior to airfield closure.
       A15.3.1.2. Respond to CP recalls and have the airfield operational within 30 minutes.
       A15.3.1.3. Advise CP and Fairbanks Approach (FAI ATCT) when the airfield is
       declared open.
   A15.3.2. CP shall:
       A15.3.2.1. Receive and maintain on-call recall rosters for known closure periods.
       A15.3.2.2. Upon notification of request to open airfield, for real-world contingency or
       deployment related mission, recall the on-call ATC, AMOPS, and Weather personnel.
A15.4. Civil Use of Military NAVAIDS. Practice approaches are authorized for civil aircraft
provided they do not create delays to locally assigned aircraft. Civil aircraft are not authorized to
touch the runway unless pre-approved by AMOPS or in an emergency IAW AFI 10-1001.
A15.5. Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS). The ATIS will be operational
during 354 FW flying, Major Flying Exercises (MFE), and at the discretion of the Eielson ATCT
WS. ATIS content will be IAW FAA JO 7110.65. Millibars will be included in the ATIS
broadcast during MFEs.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                 97


   A15.5.1. Adverse weather dissemination. Any of the following weather warnings/watches/
   advisories received by 17 OWS or base weather will be broadcast on the ATIS:
       A15.5.1.1. Lightning within 5 NM
       A15.5.1.2. Observed cross winds, 20 knots or greater
       A15.5.1.3. Ice FOD conditions for KC-135s and F-16s
       A15.5.1.4. Equivalent Chill Temp of -20°F and colder
   A15.5.2. AMOPS will relay any weather warnings/watches/advisories over the SCN.
   A15.5.3. IAW AFI 13-204V3, the 354 OG/CC waives the requirement for air traffic
   controllers to issue variable winds.
A15.6. Runway Closure. AMOPS is the only agency that may close the RWY and taxiways
for unsafe conditions. NOTAM(s) will be issued for closures lasting more than one hour. For
planned closures, AMOPS will send NOTAM(s) no earlier than three days. Control Tower will
notify FAI ATCT of all RWY closures and estimated duration. AMOPS will perform RWY
safety checks prior to opening the RWY. AMOPS will cancel the applicable NOTAM(s) when
the RWY is opened.
   A15.6.1. Closing active RWY for foreign object debris (FOD) checks. Runway closures
   may be appropriate during the presence of certain types of FOD (i.e. large aggregate,
   concrete spalling near the RWY centerline, or any other materials likely to pose a high risk
   for aircrews). Tower will notify AMOPS immediately upon observing or being notified of
   FOD that poses a high risk for operators and suspend RWY operations, if warranted.
   AMOPS will determine the necessity to transition from a RWY suspension to a RWY closure
   for FOD. AMOPS will remove the FOD, or coordinate with necessary agencies to expedite
   removal or repair prior to resuming ops or opening the RWY.
   A15.6.2. Closures more than 24-hours, but less than 96 hours, will be coordinated through
   the 354 FW/CC for approval (i.e. weekend holiday closures, runway repainting, etc), via a
   closure package which will be routed through base flying agencies. Closures in excess of 96
   hours require MAJCOM/A3 approval.
A15.7. Runway Suspension. Either Tower or AMOPS can temporarily suspend operations to
the RWY when any unsafe condition exists. The Tower WS will relay RWY suspension time,
reason for suspension, and expected duration to the FAI ATCT. AMOPS will complete an
airfield check and report the airfield status/runway condition prior to resuming operations. The
SOF may waive a FOD check following an in-flight emergency (IFE) to expedite the immediate
recovery of aircraft. In the event the SOF waives the FOD check, full responsibility of the RWY
condition is levied upon the SOF and documented on the AMOPS AF Form 3616.
A15.8. Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). AMOPS is the NOTAM publishing authority for PAEI.
The Control Tower is the NOTAM monitoring facility.
A15.9. Airfield Waivers. The 354 FW/CC is the approval authority for temporary airfield
waivers for construction activities, air shows, or temporary installation of an aircraft arresting
system. All airfield waivers are required to be reviewed annually and presented to the Facility
Utilization Board for action. 354 CES/CEAO maintains continuity of all airfield waivers.
 98                                                    354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012


A15.10. Exercises. Exercises that involve ATC and/or AMOPS personnel must be briefed at
least 48 hours in advance to the Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC). During the
exercise, ATC WS must ensure ATC facility participation does not degrade ATC services. IAW
AFI 13-204V3, the WS may interrupt or discontinue facility participation if flight safety is in
question or it interferes with the recovery of emergency aircraft.
A15.11. Permanently Closed/Unusable Portions of the Airfield. PAEI does not have any
permanently closed portions of the airfield.
A15.12. Airfield Inspections and Checks. AMOPS will accomplish airfield inspections and
checks IAW AFI 13-204V3, chapter 17, and the OSAM OI.
   A15.12.1. Airfield Lighting Inspections. Airfield lighting inspections will be done IAW
   Airfield Lighting Maintenance LOA AMOPS has on file. AMOPS will track the outage until
   corrected.
   A15.12.2. Determining Runway Surface Condition (RSC)/Runway Condition Reading
   (RCR). Accomplished IAW the OSAM OI and reported IAW the Flight Information
   Handbook (FIH).
A15.13. Airfield Maintenance. Airfield maintenance crews (sweepers, mowers, etc) will
coordinate with AMOPS prior to work on the airfield. Mowing will be IAW 354 FW/168 ARW
BASH PLAN 91-212 and AFPAM 91-212.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                99

   EVACUATION OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL AND AIRFIELD MANAGEMENT

A16.1. Evacuation of Air Traffic Control Facilities. ATC facilities may be evacuated
because of high wind, fire, bomb threat, total power outage or other situations that could
endanger personnel. Control Tower will be evacuated when sustained wind speeds reach 65
knots or greater, or gusts reach 70 knots or greater.
   A16.1.1. Tower Evacuation. Eielson does not have an alternate tower capacity. While the
   tower is evacuated, the airfield converts to a CLOSED airfield until ATC services can be re-
   established. Eielson‘s Class D airspace reverts to Class E airspace under the control of FAI
   ATCT. Aircrew should plan for alternate airfield recovery options.
      A16.1.1.1. Transmit on all frequencies, ―Eielson Control Tower is being evacuated for
      (reason), contact Fairbanks Approach for advisories (other instructions as required)‖.
      A16.1.1.2. Transmit on Ramp and Crash Nets, ―Control Tower is being evacuated
      (reason), all vehicles exit the CMA and hold short.‖
      A16.1.1.3. Activate the PCAS.
      A16.1.1.4. Notify FAI ATCT that the Tower is being evacuated (with reason and

arm/de-arm areas. The first aircraft taxiing will pull into the first spot available when entering
the arming area. EXCEPTION: When snow/ice is present, pilots will pull into ―outside‖ spots so
as not to turn ―inside‖ of other aircraft. Turning inside another aircraft is authorized, however;
there must be an empty space between aircraft. If snow obscures the taxi line, advise the SOF
who will coordinate snow removal. Personnel, aircraft, vehicles, or equipment will not stand or
park in the potential line of fire when arming forward-firing ordnance. NOTE: Use of
intercommunication equipment is required for both EOR/Arming and de-arming operations.

   A17.4.9. Notifies the MOC of all emergency situations encountered. Passes on to the MOC
   by radio or dials 377-1205 with the number of personnel, type of aircraft, and equipment
   involved.
   A17.4.10. Acts as on scene commander until relieved by a competent authority e.g., fire
   chief, explosive ordnance disposal supervisor, or weapons supervisor.
   A17.4.11. Ensures all Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and/or support equipment is
   removed from the EOR arm/de-arm areas at the end of the flying period.
   A17.4.12. Ensure a FOD inspection of the gun berm and arm/de-arm areas as required is
   accomplished prior to the take-off/landing of the first scheduled sortie.
A17.5. When flying live munitions, an MJ-1 or MHU-83- will be present in the applicable
arm/de-arm inspection area, whichever EOR location(s) will be used.
A17.6. Verify all armament switches safe and air crew keep both hands in view during
arming/de-arming procedures. Intercom communications will be used to the maximum extent
possible.
A17.7. Hung Free Fall Ordnance.
   A17.7.1. The de-arm crew will perform a thorough inspection of all munitions to ensure no
   armed/unsafe condition exist. If a condition is found that the de-arm crew is uncertain about,
   they will request assistance from at a minimum a 7 skill level weapons supervisor.
   Immediately notify the MOC if munitions cannot be safed, and evacuate the area. Do not
   reenter until Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) has remedied the situation.
   A17.7.2. When the inspection of an aircraft reveals a munitions hanging by one lug, the
   aircraft will be chocked and shut down. Any condition requiring movement and/or
   adjustment of munitions will require a fully certified load crew (ie. bomb hanging from one
   lug). After safing all other munitions, the MJ-1 or MHU-83/E will be utilized to attempt to
   lock the bomb back into the rack. If the munitions cannot be locked back into rack, the
   weapons load crew will remove the munitions. Notify Munitions Control as required to
   arrange for delivery of munitions handling trailer for proper security of removed munitions.
A17.8. Hung Forward Firing Ordnance.
   A17.8.1. If de-arm personnel are unsuccessful at safing the forward firing ordnance, the
   aircraft will be chocked and shut down. Immediately notify MOC and evacuate the area. Do
   not reenter until Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) has remedied the situation.
A17.9. Chaff/Flare.
   A17.9.1. At the de-arm area, chaff and flare modules will be inspected for partially ejected
   cartridges, or cartridges with damaged end caps. If conditions are met, ground crew may
   safe/pin the countermeasure system if doing so doesn‘t place crew member directly
   under/next to suspect module. A ground emergency will be declared by contacting MOC and
   area will be evacuated as directed by the fire chief. EOD will respond to safe system (as
   applicable) and download the chaff and/or flare modules, as required.
A17.10. Unsafe/System Stoppage/Jammed Gun.
354FWI 11-250 15 FEBRUARY 2012                                                                    103


   A17.10.1. In the event of an unsafe, system stoppage, or jammed gun, only highly
   knowledgeable and experienced personnel will attempt to safe the gun. If the system cannot
   be cleared, qualified armament maintenance section personnel will be called to assist in the
   operation.
   A17.10.2. The MOC will notify the weapons expediter and armament maintenance section
   personnel of all in-flight emergencies involving guns. The weapons expediter will dispatch
   personnel to install safety pins, and attempt to safe/clear the gun.
   A17.10.3. WARNING: Personnel will not attempt to clear rounds from the gun when system
   stoppage (jam) occurred in flight unless otherwise authorized per MDS technical data. If
   clear cannot be verified or achieved, download all live munitions prior to continuing gun
   clearing maintenance. If the crew cannot mechanically or electrically safe the gun or suspect
   there are live rounds in the firing path, direct the aircraft to the gun berm.
   A17.10.4. Weapons expediters and Armament technicians will be prepared with necessary
   tools/equipment/personnel to respond to any hung/jammed gun scenario. If the gun can be
   verified safe/clear, return aircraft to parking area. If unsuccessful, direct the pilot to taxi the
   aircraft to the gun berm and shut down to be electrically and mechanically safed to the
   maximum extent possible. If gun clear cannot be verified, download all live munitions first,
   if applicable, and then continue with gun clearing maintenance in accordance with applicable
   technical data.
   A17.10.5. Gun system sudden stoppages or jammed guns that occur during firing require the
   entire gun system removed for an in-shop inspection.
   A17.10.6. During normal de-arm operations, if suspected live rounds are in a gun that cannot
   be cleared, the pilot will be directed to declare a ground emergency and taxi the aircraft to the
   gun berm. The de-arm crew will notify the MOC as soon as possible of the unsafe/jammed
   gun. Download all live munitions first, if applicable, and then continue with gun clearing
   maintenance in accordance with applicable technical data.
   A17.10.7. If a gun system is discovered to be unsafe/jammed, (ie. chambered rounds) during
   normal thru-flight inspection, evacuate the area as required, and notify MOC of the ground
   emergency. Qualified personnel will attempt to safe the gun system. If the system cannot be
   cleared, qualified armament maintenance section personnel will be called to assist in the
   operation.
   A17.10.8. Weapons personnel may remove the gun system or necessary components to
   facilitate clearing operations.
A17.11. Hot brakes.
   A17.11.1. If brake channels are glowing hot or smoke exists, do not approach brakes.
   Deflation of the main landing gear tire indicates melting of thermal plugs and hot brake
   condition. Notify the pilot and evacuate area immediately to a minimum safe distance of 300
   feet and notify the MOC of the situation.
   A17.11.2. MOC will run the Hot Brakes Emergency Action Checklist. Prepare to move the
   de-arm operation to an alternate area as designated by the SOF. MOC will relay to the de-
   arm crew and applicable production superintendent of alternate de-arm area.
