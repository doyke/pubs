Planning And Operations, 27 February 2008 and the AFI10-2501_AFGSCSUP, Air Force
Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning And Operations,1 April 2010 . It defines the
Malmstrom Air Force Base EM program as a cross-functional program that integrates procedures

evaluation, training of personnel and warning. This publication establishes responsibilities,
procedures and standards and its prescribed planning process is intended to help commanders
achieve unity of effort, allocate and utilize resources effectively and identify shortfalls in their
response capabilities for Malmstrom Air Force Base (AFB). The EM program serves as a focal
point, bringing together unit operations that interact during contingencies so the installation can
continue its missions. This publication applies to all personnel assigned to the 341st Missile
Wing and subordinate units and personnel assigned or attached to, or supported by, Malmstrom
AFB. It does not apply to the Air National Guard (ANG) or the Air Force Reserve (AFRC).
