This instruction implements AFPD 10-2, Readiness, 30 October 2006. It establishes procedures and
guidelines for Key Personnel Status notifications. It requires commanders of subordinate organizations to
inform Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency Intelligence Operations Center
(IOC) of temporary duty (TDY) or leave status whenever they depart their duty location. It does not apply
to AF ISR Agency-gained Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve units. Ensure that all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123
(to be replaced by AFMAN 33-363) and are disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Dispo-
sition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil. Contact supporting records managers as
required.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

directly subordinate units. Additionally, instruction updated to reflect redesignation to Air Force Intelli-
gence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency.
