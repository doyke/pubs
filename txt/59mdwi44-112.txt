updated Texas law requiring on-line reporting of deaths utilizing the Texas Electronic Registrar;
updated the definition of fetal death; added a requirement for the attending physician to either
complete the death procedure process or designate another physician to do so; updated references
and offices of responsibility.
1. General Overview. This instruction directs the processing of deceased patients to include
management of physical remains as well as administrative coordination, communication, and
paperwork. External agencies that could be involved in this process include the Bexar County
Medical Examiner (BCME), Armed Forces Medical Examiner System (AFMES), San Antonio
Military Medical Center (SAMMC), and the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS).
2. Program Responsibilities.
     2.1. The 59th Medical Wing Commander (59 MDW/CC) or designated representative is
     responsible for overall management of the program and ensuring death reporting is
     accomplished per AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services.
     2.2. Physician. Responsible for determining when a death occurred, making proper legal
     next of kin (NOK) notification following the death of non-active duty patients. Responsible
     for discussing medical examiner cases with the BCME and/or Armed Forces Medical
     Examiner (AFME) (See paragraph 3.1.). Ensures death procedure process is complete prior
     to leaving facility to prevent delays in notifications. If the attending physician will be
     unavailable to complete the entire death procedure process, including providing the required
     information for the certificate of death or to the Medical Examiner (ME), the attending must
     designate an associate physician to complete the process and notify the designee and must
     notify Patient Administration of that designation.
     2.3. Nurse. Responsible for notifying Patient Administration immediately when a death
     occurs within WHASC, asking the family if they wish to speak to a chaplain of their
     religious preference, and transporting and signing the body into the morgue. Ensures
     physician who pronounced is present until death procedure is complete.
     2.4. Patient Administration. Responsible for ensuring all death documentation and death
     reporting has been accomplished correctly according to AFI 41-210, TRICAE Operations and
     Patient Administration Functions and state policy. Not responsible for physical handling of
     the deceased in any situation.
     2.5. Cashier, Medical Business Service Flight (59MDW/SGART). Receives and safeguards
     deceased patient’s valuables. Releases deceased patient’s valuables to NOK or ME as
     applicable.
     2.6. Director, Autopsy Services (59 CSPG/SGVLP). Responsible for storage of remains in
     morgue (including maintenance of the deceased in conditions suitable until release for burial)
     and conducting post mortem examinations if requested/necessary. Responsible for remains
     when conducting post mortem examinations.
3. Program Procedures.
     3.1. Physician in Attendance:
        3.1.1. Ascertains that all signs of life have ceased and pronounces the time of death of
        the patient.
59MDWI44-112 30 JULY 2013                                                                      3


     3.1.2. Records in the medical record or provides a dictated record of all necessary entries
     pertaining to the death. Establishes the cause of death in accordance with Texas DSHS
     guidelines available at https://texasvsu-ed.org or the reverse side of DSHS Form VS-
     112, Certificate of Death.
     3.1.3. Completes items 30-40, as appropriate on a working copy of DSHS Form VS-112,
     and forwards the working copy to the Patient Administration. As the certification of
     death must now be made electronically on the Texas Electronic Registrar (TER) website,
     the working copy is not signed. Alternately, the physician completes the physician
     portion of the Death TER. Registration for and access to the TER is available at
     http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/vs/field/. Training on completion of the Death TER is
     available at https://texasvsu-ed.org.
        3.1.3.1. State the actual cause of death, not the mechanism of dying. The cause of
        death must be entered using an acceptable standard diagnosis, even though it may be
        based on the immediate cause of death on Line 1, but these generic mechanisms must
        be qualified by a specific disease process (the underlying cause of death) on Line 2.
        A diagnosis of “pending an Autopsy” is acceptable; however, an amended Certificate
        of Death must follow. If an autopsy will not be performed and the cause of death is
        unknown, it is acceptable to list the cause of death as “unspecified natural cause(s).”
        3.1.3.2. Upon completion of the working copy of the Death Certificate, Patient
        Administration personnel will input the information into the TER website. The staff
        physician (if different from the pronouncing physician) will receive an email
        notification that the electronic death certificate is ready for review and certification.
        Patient Administration will provide a username and password once the initial
        notification has been sent. The staff physician must certify the online death
        certificate within 3 days of the patient’s death. If assistance is required, Patient
        Administration can be reached at (210) 292-5788.
     3.1.4. Following the death of a non-active duty patient, the physician will assure
     notification of the BCME of death. The BCME may waive jurisdiction and allow
     WHASC to perform the autopsy. If the autopsy is to be completed at WHASC, the
     physician will inform the family that the results will be provided when they become
     available. For non-active duty autopsies, the following forms will be completed and
     signed with assistance from Patient Administration: Standard Form (SF) 523,
     Authorization for Autopsy/Autopsy Consultation Worksheet; four copies of AF Form 146,
     Death Tag; AF Form 570, Notification of Patient’s Medical Status; and 59 MDW Form
     3438, Death Procedure. Physicians are responsible for calling the BCME for report or
     conference. If the physician wants to be present for autopsy, they must indicate on the
     back of SF 523 that they wish to be present and will include their pager number.
     3.1.5. For cases where the deceased is infectious, physician will annotate on the AF
     Form 146. This will notify the funeral home personnel that the deceased is infectious.
     3.1.6. Makes or arranges proper notification of the NOK. Active duty death notifications
     will be coordinated in accordance with AFI 36-3002_59 MDW Supplement, Casualty
     Services.

           3.1.6.1. Makes personal notification of the death to the NOK when the family
           member is physically present within WHASC. If WHASC performs an autopsy, the
           requesting physician will notify NOK when preliminary results are available.
           3.1.6.2. Notifies Patient Administration when the deceased is an active duty member
           and the NOK is not physically present within the facility. Patient Administration, 59
           MDSS/SGSBT, will then contact Casualty Affairs to make notification.
           3.1.6.3. Notifies by telephone when the deceased is retired or a dependent and the
           NOK are not physically present at WHASC. If NOK is not available in person or by

        does not exist (Attachment 2). If Power of Attorney (POA) questions arise, ask the
        NOK to provide a copy of the document, as well as any other document that
        designates a person to control disposition of the remains of the person in question.
        Consult with Medical Law (AFLOA JACC/MLFSC) at (210) 292-7808 to determine

     personnel) will receive all personal effects. The personal property receipt will be kept in
     the death record. In all other cases, the personal property will be turned over to the 802
     Security Forces, Office of Special Investigation, Detachment 409 or the BCME’s office,
     as appropriate.
        3.3.8.1. Requests for disposition of personal property from the NOK by telephone or

        released to the NOK at the time of death, they will be transported to the funeral home
        with the remains.
        3.3.8.2. Unclaimed funds of the deceased are submitted by the Accounting and
        Finance section, 59 MDW/SGAR, 120 days after all efforts (telephone or written

               FSS/FSOXM, for assistance in making funeral arrangements and to obtain a
               briefing on applicable survivor benefits.
        3.3.9. When the body is unclaimed, notifies the Mortuary Affairs Office in writing of all
        efforts taken to locate the NOK. The Mortuary Affairs Office will, in turn, furnish

        the following circumstances:
           4.1.1.1. When a death occurs under circumstances suggesting crime, suicide or other
           appearances requiring investigation. Do not exclude a post mortem merely because a
           superficial examination may suggest a conclusion as to cause of death.
           4.1.1.2. When a cause of death may constitute a menace to public health.
           4.1.1.3. When the physician is unable to establish the cause of death.
           4.1.1.4. When the commanding officer of an installation or command, the
           investigating officer, any fact-finding body, or medical officer requires the post
           mortem examination to determine the true cause of death, to secure information for
           the completion of military records or to protect the welfare of the military
           community. Authority to direct an autopsy under these circumstances rests with the
           59 MDW/CC by delegation from the installation commander or the AFMES
           representative. Nevertheless, as a courtesy, the NOK of the deceased are notified if a
           post mortem examination is to be performed under these circumstances. Note: The
           NOK will not be asked to provide consent for this procedure; however, the NOK
           should be made aware of normal autopsy procedures, such as the need to remove
           organs and tissue from the body for examination.
           4.1.1.5. Active duty members that die off base fall under the jurisdiction of local
           (civilian) authorities.
        4.1.2. Except for forensic cases, which do not require an authorization, any deceased
        person received from another military facility outside of Bexar County for post mortem
        examination must be properly identified and accompanied by an Authorization for
        Autopsy form and Medical Records.             The death notification procedures and
        accomplishment of a death certificate do not apply unless the member is active duty.
     4.2. County Medical Examiner:
59MDWI44-112 30 JULY 2013                                                                        9


     4.2.1. The following constitute a possible BCME case: an Urgent Care Clinic death, a
     child younger than six years old, death in the operating room, or the deceased is
     unidentified (John or Jane Doe). Note: Active duty members deaths occurring at
     WHASC or on Lackland Air Force Base, death in the operating room, and/or death
     resulting from trauma/accident/homicide/suicide are reportable to the AFMES.
     4.2.2. Patient Administration is the point of contact for all inquiries and requests to and
     from the BCME Office relative to death cases.
     4.2.3. Patient Administration provides copies of all medical records of the deceased to
     the BCME’s office. All copies of the medical records accompany the body when being
     transported to the BCME’s office. HIPAA requirements do not prevent the release of this
     information to the BCME office. However, the office releasing information to the
     BCME must properly document the disclosure and account for it to the Release of
     Healthcare Information Office, 59 MDSS/SGSBT.
     4.2.4. All requests for laboratory specimens from the BCME’s Office, should be directed
     to the laboratory.
     4.2.5. The regional AFME may order an autopsy or a second autopsy on any active duty
     member examined at a civilian facility, if the initial post-mortem examination was not
     complete.
  4.3. Viewing deceased in morgue. If the NOK was unable to view the body, they will be
  directed to Patient Administration. The family will be strongly encouraged to wait until the
  deceased is prepared by the funeral home and ready for viewing in the mortuary. If the
  family still desires to see the deceased, Patient Administration will contact the staff nurse and
  a chaplain for assistance in setting up the viewing and accompanying the relatives.
     4.3.1. The deceased will be placed on one of the death carts and arranged for viewing in
     the morgue after coordination with pathology for the morgue room.
         4.3.1.1. The curtain will be pulled to cover body lockers.
         4.3.1.2. Viewing will be limited to two or three main family members.
         4.3.1.3. Patient Administration will provide access to the morgue in coordination
         with the involved clinical staff.
     4.3.2. In all cases where WHASC performs an autopsy, Patient Administration will refer
     family members to the Release of Healthcare Information Department. Preliminary
     results can be obtained from the primary provider (doctor signing the request for the
     autopsy) in up to 48 hours after the autopsy is complete, or a hard copy can be obtained
     from Release of Health at (210) 292-6069, in about 4-8 weeks.
