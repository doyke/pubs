   lockouts. These master keys are the sole responsibility of the Dorm Mayor and must not be
   ―loaned‖ to residents.
   4.3. When requested to assist with lockouts, the Dorm Mayor will accompany the resident to
   their room and unlock the door. If a master key is lost or stolen, Dorm Mayors must report
   this to 39 CES/CEAC immediately.
5. Bay Orderly Program. Incirlik AB uses a centralized bay orderly program aimed at
increasing resident accountability and ownership in dormitory facilities and grounds. This
program will help to ensure the maintenance, operability and overall cleanliness of Incirlik‘s UH
campuses.
   5.1. Participation in the bay orderly program is mandated for units with residents in UH
   facilities 880, 882, 885, 892, 894, 896, 960, 962 and 964. The bay orderly program does not
   apply to UH residents in Herky Housing or temporarily-converted Military Family Housing
   units.
   5.2. 39 CES/CEAC Responsibilities: 39 CES/CEAC is the office of primary responsibility
   and is responsible for ensuring the effective and efficient management of the bay orderly
   program. A duty roster will be maintained on the Incirlik AB Public Share Drive at P:\39
   ABW STAFF\39 ABW Dorm Manager\Bay Orderly Program. The assignment of bay
   orderlies will be closely coordinated with unit First Sergeants and posted on the duty roster.
   Roll will be taken Monday – Friday at 0900 hours, and daily duties will be assigned in
 6                                                      INCIRLIKABI32-6006 9 MARCH 2011


     accordance with the bay orderly checklist. No-shows and late arrivals will be reported to the
     unit First Sergeant immediately for action. Bay orderlies will be released at 1600 hours
     Monday – Friday. In the event that daily duties are accomplished prior to 1600 hours, bay
     orderlies will be released back to their units and First Sergeants will be notified via email. A
     weekly safety briefing will be provided to the assigned bay orderlies. 39 CES/CEAC is
     responsible for ensuring the availability of adequate common area cleaning supplies in
     accordance with (IAW) AFI 32-6005.
     5.3. First Sergeant Responsibilities: First Sergeants are responsible for assigning bay
     orderlies and updating the roster maintained by 39 CES/CEAC on the Public Share Drive.
     One bay orderly must be provided per dormitory/per week as deemed necessary by 39
     CES/CEAC. For mixed-occupancy dormitories, the First Sergeant of the unit with the largest
     number of residents is the primary POC for the facility and is responsible for coordinating a
     fair-share distribution of bay orderly duty days across all units in the dormitory. First
     Sergeants are responsible for taking action on no-shows, late arrivals and poor performers.
     Scheduling and supervision of G.I. parties and cleanings beyond the scope of the bay orderly
     checklist are the responsibility of the units occupying the dormitories.
     5.4. Bay Orderly Responsibilities: Perform bay orderly duty from Tuesday – Monday (7
     days) as scheduled by unit First Sergeants. Bay orderlies are only required to report to 39
     CES/CEAC for duty on normal 39 ABW duty days. However, they are still responsible for
     accomplishing the items listed on the bay orderly checklist (Attachment 3) during all down
     days. Completion of these items will be initialed on the bay orderly checklist and verified
     upon reporting to 39 CES/CEAC on the next duty day. Bay orderlies report to the 39
     CES/CEAC CDM office in Building 962 Monday – Friday at 0900 hours (with the exception
     of holidays and down days). Thoroughly complete all requirements on the supplied bay
     orderly checklist. Perform self supervised litter detail on weekends, holidays and down days
     to ensure a clean and professional appearance is maintained in Incirlik‘s UH campuses.
     Areas of responsibility include but are not limited to all common areas, day rooms, laundry
     rooms, bathrooms, storage rooms, custodial rooms (formally known as Abbi rooms), storage
     lockers, Barbecues, flammable lockers, kitchens, gazebos, grounds, and garbage cans for
     each member‘s assigned dormitory . Report back to the CDM office at 1600 Monday –
     Thursday for release back to unit work center. Report back to the CDM office at 1400 on
     Friday (or the last wing duty day of the week) for a weekend safety briefing.
     5.5. Duty Hours. Duty hours are Tuesday through Monday from 0900 – 1600 hours, with a
     one-hour lunch break from 1200 – 1300 hours. In the event that daily duties are
     accomplished prior to 1600 hours, bay orderlies will be released back to their units and First
     Sergeants will be notified via email.
6. Resident Quarters Cleaning Standards. All dormitory residents will comply with the
following room standards.
     6.1. All unaccompanied residents will comply with the following standards. Neat, clean,
     and orderly living quarters are absolutely essential to good health and hygiene. The
     condition of individual areas in the room, latrine, hallways, and storage rooms characterize
     the person and the unit in the eyes of others. For this reason, overly restrictive standardized
     requirements will not be imposed. The primary objective is for UH to be kept clean and
     orderly.
INCIRLIKABI32-6006 9 MARCH 2011                                                                 7


  6.2. Individual beds will be made before departing room, using either issued or personal
  bedspreads and blankets. Government issued linen is available. Residents may elect to
  purchase and use their own bedding. The resident will clean all linens, government owned or
  personal at least weekly.
  6.3. Contents of individual wall lockers, wardrobes, and closets will be neatly arranged.
  Outside surfaces of lockers will be free of stains, marks, stickers, and graffiti. Doors and
  drawers left ajar or overflowing with contents are subject to inspection.
  6.4. Clean blinds and drapes regularly. Drapes will be neatly hung, clean, and free of stains.
  Clean inside windows, channels and windowsills monthly. Outside windows will be cleaned
  and washed at the discretion of 39 CES/CEAC and work accomplished consistent with good
  safety practices.
  6.5. Residents are responsible for routine spot removal and vacuuming carpet thoroughly to
  remove foreign matter. Do not use general purpose cleansers such as Formula 409, Resolve,
  Spot Shot, Windex, or any other product containing a bleaching agent (chlorine) on carpet.
  Use only cleaning products and shampoos provided or recommended by 39 CES/CEAC.
  Non-removable stains are considered beyond fair wear and tear and, therefore, are resident-
  caused damages for which the resident will be held liable. Any stains that cannot be
  removed will result in charges for replacement.
  6.6. Residents must take trash to the dumpster daily. It may not be left outside the room or
  placed in the dayroom or other common areas. Residents are responsible for picking up all
  trash in front of their doorway/window within 10 feet from entrances.
  6.7. Keep light fixtures with working bulbs, lamps, wall plugs, and switches clean and in
  good repair. Replacement common light bulbs are available from the 39th Civil Engineer
  Squadron Self Help store or the CDM office. Residents can be issued two common light
  bulbs per month. Vanity light bulb replacement will be coordinated through 39th Civil
  Engineer Squadron Customer Service (39 CES/CECMMA).
  6.8. Clean interiors of refrigerators regularly. Defrost the freezer once per month unless
  needed more frequently. Remove all food particles or dust/dirt from the rubber seals around
  the edge of the doors leaving them clean. Be sure to clean around and under the refrigerator.
  While defrosting the freezer, do not use sharp instruments to chip away ice. This practice
  may puncture the coils, and you may be held liable for replacing the unit.
  6.9. Clean ovens, broiler units, and top burners regularly to prevent a fire hazard. Use oven
  cleaner only on the inside of the oven. Do not use cleaner on ovens that are self-cleaning.
  Residents are liable for any damage caused to the range. Oven cleaner is extremely caustic
  and will damage any surface it comes in contact with other than the inside of the oven.
  Never leave the oven unattended when it is in use.
  6.10. Clean microwaves inside and out at all times. Never leave the microwave unattended
  when it is in use.
  6.11. Bathrooms must be kept especially clean due to the potential for bacteria growth.
  Clean the toilet inside and out with a disinfectant cleaning product weekly. Clean the shower
  tile, bathtub, and sliding glass doors/shower curtain, with a disinfectant type cleaner at least
  weekly. Remove soap scum and other residue on walls. Sliding glass doors/shower curtains

     must be clean and have no mold or mildew stains. Pay particular attention to the curtain
     wall, as it will mold quickly if allowed to remain damp for extended periods of time. Utilize
     the built in exhaust fans to clear the bathroom of excess moisture in the air after showering.
     Be sure the ceiling light is clean and operational. Be sure the entire ceiling is clean and has
     no build-up of mold or mildew. Clean the floor, to include behind the toilet and in the
     corners. Keep mirrors clean and free of stains and splatters.
     6.12. Residents will be held liable for all damage to government property in their room
     beyond fair wear and tear. This includes damage or loss of property due to unauthorized
     modification of furnishings.
