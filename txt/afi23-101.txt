SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises AFI 23-101 by updating/adding critical specific policy information
that was omitted during the transition from AFMAN 23-110, Air Force Supply System. Changes
include clarification of A4LM and MAJCOM responsibilities as well as detailed policy and
process interpretation of Materiel Management procedures. Finally, this instruction was tiered
IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

This guidance applies to all personnel (military, civilian, and contractors) working for the United
States Air Force (USAF). It applies to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National
Guard (ANG) Units. This instruction implements AFPD 23-1, Materiel Management and
facilitates the implementation of Department of Defense (DoD) guidance from DoD 4140.1-R,
DoD Supply Chain Materiel Management Regulation; DoD Directive 1225.6, Equipping the
Reserve Forces; DoD 4140.26-M, DoD Integrated Materiel Management (IMM) for Consumable
Items: Operating Procedures for Item Management Coding (IMC); DoD 4140.27-M, Shelf-Life
Item Management Manual; and DoDI 4140.58, National Guard and Reserve Equipment Report
(NGRER). Refer to AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management, for
management of Class V (munitions) materiel. Exception: Organizations performing Supply
Chain Management (SCM) functions using an approved contractor managed/operated inventory
management system will adhere to contractor-provided guidance or MAJCOM-developed
guidance for operating the inventory management system in lieu of this AFI. This includes
systems such as the Automated Logistics Management and Support System (ALMSS) in support
of the U-2 program or Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) in support of the F-35.

                                      GUIDING PRINCIPLES

Section 1A—Purpose, Scope and Description of Instruction

1.1. Purpose, Scope and Description of Instruction.
     1.1.1. Chapter 1 overview. This chapter outlines the instruction’s purpose; AF guidance for
     Materiel Management Organization and Structure at base level; Satellite Operations; Supply
     Chain Materiel Management Goals and Metrics; Air Force Materiel Management Boards and
     Working Groups.
     1.1.2. Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is to implement direction from the Secretary
     of the Air Force (SECAF) as outlined in AFPD 23-1, Materiel Management. This policy
     provides direction for determining and stocking materiel requirements, cataloging, ordering,
     sourcing, receiving, delivering, and return/disposal of materiel for Class IX repair parts and
     select Class VII major end items as identified and approved by Headquarters Air Force
     (HAF). Additionally, guidance for other classes of supply, such as Class V munitions is
     covered in specific subject areas. These references will be specifically enumerated where
     applicable.
        1.1.2.1. This instruction supports the Integrated Life Cycle Management (ILCM)
        Enterprise chain by providing applicable materiel management guidance to ensure the
        warfighter receives the right support at the right place and the right time. Additionally,
        this guidance supports the Air Force Expeditionary Logistics for the 21st Century
        (eLog21) umbrella strategy that integrates and governs logistics transformation
        initiatives.
        1.1.2.2. Delegation of Authority: Air Force (AF). A4/7 delegates responsibility for
        procedural guidance development to Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) AFMC shall
        develop separate procedural guidance as required to implement the following areas: (T-
        1).
            1.1.2.2.1. Provisioning
            1.1.2.2.2. Wholesale receipt processing
            1.1.2.2.3. Item Management (IM)
            1.1.2.2.4. Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS)
            1.1.2.2.5. Storage, management and redistribution of Chemical Warfare Defense
            Equipment (CWDE) excess assets
            1.1.2.2.6. Stock Positioning
            1.1.2.2.7. Materiel Disposition
            1.1.2.2.8. Security Assistance.
     1.1.3. Scope. AF policy requires all government-owned property to be under the control of a
     responsible Accountable Officer (AO) at all times. The AO’s to which this instruction applies
     are:
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     9


      1.1.3.1. AF organizations under the direct jurisdiction of the CSAF.
      1.1.3.2. AF organizations under the jurisdiction of overseas commands instructed to
      maintain formal stock record accounts.
      1.1.3.3. Designated agencies accessing the AF materiel management system, unless
      specifically excepted by the CSAF.
      1.1.3.4. Supply Chain Management (SCM) operations providing direct support to the F-
      35 are exempted from adhering to this instruction. The process will be managed IAW F-
      35 Joint Program Office (JPO)-approved guidance. (T-1)
   1.1.4. Compliance Terminology. For the purposes of this instruction, the following
   definitions apply:
      1.1.4.1. Shall, Must, Will - Indicate mandatory requirements. (Will is also used to
      express a declaration of purpose for a future event.)
      1.1.4.2. Should - Indicates a preferred method of accomplishment.
      1.1.4.3. May - Indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.1.5. Construct. This instruction has the same construct as AFMAN 23-122 and AFH 23-
   123, Vol 2, Pt 1. While not all sections within AFI 23-101 have associated procedures
   enumerated in AFMAN 23-122 or processes in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, those sections
   where procedures/processes are detailed have the same section titles. For example, Sec. 5D,
   Equipment Management is the same section in AFI 23-101, AFMAN 23-122, and AFH 23-
   123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.
      1.1.5.1. Users are encouraged to refer to Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 for reference
      information as well as identification of legacy AF supply chain functions with updated
      terminology.
      1.1.5.2. References to materiel management systems. This instruction provides guidance
      which properly should not be predicated on systems’ capabilities. Guidance shall drive
      systems requirements. As such, the vast majority of references to systems information in
      this instruction are systems “neutral” and are referred to as “materiel management IT
      systems” or similar terminology. AFI 23-101’s “companion” publications, AFMAN 23-
      122 and AFH 23-123 provide more specific systems references (e.g. Integrated Logistics
      Support-Supply (ILS-S), Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS)).
   1.1.6. Supplements. This instruction may be supplemented no lower than the Major
   Command (MAJCOM) level unless otherwise indicated. MAJCOMs supplementing this
   instruction must coordinate with AF/A4LM and will follow guidance in AFI 33-360,

Section 1C—Satellite Operations

1.3. Satellite Operations. Satellite Accounts and Accountability. There are two categories of
satellites, autonomous or non-autonomous.
   1.3.1. Category II/IIA (Autonomous).
       1.3.1.1. Accountability. The computer support base (CSB) LRS CC/AO retains
       accountability for Categories II/IIA Accounts.
       1.3.1.2. Decentralization. The LRS CC/AO may request a satellite account if approved
       by AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity.
       1.3.1.3. Category II/IIA Satellite Operations Officer (SOO). The SOO for category II/IIA
       satellites is responsible to the CSB LRS CC/AO. The SOO will supervise operator
       maintenance of terminal equipment. (T-3). This includes ensuring that operator
       maintenance is scheduled and completed. When unscheduled downtime requires
       remedial maintenance, the SOO works with the CSB and local communication personnel
       (if applicable) to repair the terminal.
   1.3.2. Category III/IIIA (Non-autonomous).
       1.3.2.1. The Satellite LRS CC/AO is the accountable supply officer and is responsible to
       the commander or senior materiel officer for the effective and efficient management of
       the supply account. Satellite supply accounts are not authorized a deputy satellite
       LRS/CC.

  communication lines is a CSB responsibility. Either the LRS CC/AO or Chief of Base
  Network Control Center (BNCC) at the CSB will submit a request and coordinate with the
  satellite parent command. (T-2).
  1.3.5. Common Support Records and Management Products. Where common support
  records and management products are involved, the satellite will comply with CSB policies
  and follow CSB directives unless otherwise amended by other documentation such as a
  Memorandum of Understanding/Memorandum of Agreement (MOU/MOA). (T-2).
  1.3.6. Proposals and Modification. Units desiring a new satellite or rehome of existing
  accounts will route their request with complete justification through their applicable
  MAJCOM. In turn, the MAJCOM will forward to the AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations
  Activity for final approval. When a MAJCOM has a requirement to relocate a supply
  satellite to another CSB, they will ensure that the requirement is coordinated with the
  command's Information Systems (SC) and the Defense Finance and Accounting System
  (DFAS). In addition, the requirement must be coordinated with the parent command of the
  proposed new host CSB if the two affected bases belong to different MAJCOMs. If they
  have the same parent command, no further coordination is required. However, if they are
  assigned to separate commands, the desired CSB parent command will ensure that the
  relocation proposal is coordinated with SC prior to concurring with the relocation. (T-2).
  1.3.7. Notification of changes. For CSB changes, the gaining CSB parent command will
  ensure that reporting requirements are accomplished. For changes other than CSB changes,
  the MAJCOM will ensure that approved changes are reported to Retail Systems Program
  Office. (T-2).
  1.3.8. Establishment of the Satellite Account.
     1.3.8.1. Assignment of Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC). and
     Type Account Codes. Following AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity
     approval, the CSB LRS CC/AO will submit a request for the assignment of a DODAAC
     and Routing Identifier (RID) for the satellite. (T-2). The request will be made on-line
     IAW AFI 24-230. Upon receipt of the DODAAC and RID, the CSB LRS CC/AO will
     ensure coordination with the appropriate office to establish connectivity and funding. (T-
     3).
     1.3.8.2. A series of system designators will have an account code for the DODAAC of
     FB or FE depending on the type of support being supplied. ANG satellites will submit
     their requests to the National Guard Bureau. (T-2).
     1.3.8.3. Notification of DODAAC or CSB Changes and System Designators. Retail
     Systems Program Office (SPO) will be notified when DODAAC or CSB changes are
     made. For each alphanumeric systems designator, the CSB LRS CC/AO will provide

     will be documented and validated by the computing and reviewing activities.
     2.2.2.3.9. Conduct periodic reviews at the wholesale level. These reviews will
     include detailed analysis of individual item computation worksheets, procurement
     histories, repair schedules, and other documentation used to support management
     actions.
     2.2.2.3.10. Continually evaluate and verify data and factors used in determining
     stock requirements.
     2.2.2.3.11. Ensure management emphasis on prompt reduction or cancellation of
     purchase requests and consideration of terminating unnecessary items on contract.
     2.2.2.3.12. Ensure that where feasible, termination costs will be obtained in a timely
     manner to establish the cost-effectiveness of termination. AFMC will develop a
     termination cost model to be used to estimate termination costs if they can’t be
     obtained in a timely manner.

36                                                              AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


        2.2.3.1.8. Ensure retention of adequate stockage for issuance and MAJCOM
        coordination for contingency purposes.
        2.2.3.1.9. Establish quantitative goals to reduce unneeded inventory.
        2.2.3.1.10. Ensure potential reutilization/disposal materiel, as well as inactive and
        obsolete items, are removed from the AF supply system stock in an efficient, timely,
        and economical manner.
        2.2.3.1.11. Ensure timely management action to reduce or cancel purchase requests
        and terminate contracts when requirements are reduced for items in the procurement

        2.2.3.1.13. Ensure there are adequate quality control procedures established to verify
        and validate the data and critical factors that affect requirements computations.
     2.2.3.2. Categories and Characteristics of Consumable Items:
        2.2.3.2.1. An item categorized as a consumable is an item of supply (except
        explosive ordnance and major end items of equipment) that’s normally expended or
        used up beyond recovery in the use for which it is designed or intended.
        2.2.3.2.2. Categorize consumables according to the Expendability, Recoverability,
        and Reparability Category (ERRC). See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 for Expendability,
        Recoverability, Reparability, Cost Designators (ERRCD).
            2.2.3.2.2.1. Consumables may be expendable and nonreparable (XB3) or
            expendable and field repairable (XF3).
               2.2.3.2.2.1.1. XB3 items may be reconditioned (cleaned, painted,
               straightened, sharpened, etc.) by users. XB3 items costing $50 or more may be
               authorized repair by the competent maintenance authority at organizational
               and intermediate levels.
               2.2.3.2.2.1.2. Don’t return unserviceable goods marked XF3 to the depot or
               specialized repair unit. Mark XF3 items that cannot be restored at the retail
               maintenance level and transfer them to servicing DLADS.
            2.2.3.2.2.2. Non-working capital funds items are categorized as EOQ
            requirements.
               2.2.3.2.2.2.1. Derive the EOQ requirement from a mathematical equation
               both for wholesale and retail. For consistency, wholesale and retail activities
               share computational methodology.
     2.2.3.3. Consumable Item Computational Guidance:
        2.2.3.3.1. Use the EOQ to:
            2.2.3.3.1.1. Minimize the total cost of ordering and holding inventories.
            2.2.3.3.1.2. Compute     peacetime    and   WRM     purchase    requirements   for
            consumables.
            2.2.3.3.1.3. Develop categories for budgeting and evaluating inventory.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    37


        2.2.3.3.2. Consider the importance of each mission in determining which
        requirements to fill.
     2.2.3.4. Consumable Item Computing Requirements:
        2.2.3.4.1. Determine EOQ at the wholesale level for a maximum of 24 months
        demand. To determine the minimum EOQ, use either the Administrative Lead Time
        (ALT) or 6 months, whichever is less.
           2.2.3.4.1.1. The EOQ minimum level may be overridden if a lesser quantity is
           demonstrably more cost effective.
           2.2.3.4.1.2. AFMC may adjust the maximum EOQ downward to ensure they
           operate within budget.
           2.2.3.4.1.3. Adjust EOQ downward for phased-out end items or those declining
           in demand.
        2.2.3.4.2. Determine EOQ at the retail level-for a maximum of 12 months demand.
           2.2.3.4.2.1. Adjust EOQ downward for phased-out end items or declining in
           demand.
           2.2.3.4.2.2. Override the targeted EOQ requirement when more cost-effective
           quantity is documented.
        2.2.3.4.3. Estimate projections for demand-based requirements using past records of
        recurring demand. Factor in serviceable returns.
           2.2.3.4.3.1. Purchase demand-based items when demand for items exceeds goods
           on-hand and on order.
           2.2.3.4.3.2. Determine the reorder point by adding together the ALT, stock due-
           out quantity, variable safety level and applicable non-demand-based additive
           requirements.
               2.2.3.4.3.2.1. Determine the variable safety level to augment the operating
               level of supply. This allows for continuous operations when demand rises
               steeply or when lead-time is extended. Decrease safety levels as fluctuations
               even out.
               2.2.3.4.3.2.2. Determine non-demand-based requirements for goods that have
               limited or no demand history, but qualify for purchase based on other criteria.
               Two types of non-demand-based requirements are insurance (INS) and
               calendar time change items.
               2.2.3.4.3.2.3. Identify essential items with no demand records or forecast for
               failure reports and stock them at the wholesale level as INS items. These
               should not exceed the cost of one minimum replacement unit without
               documentation and justification of the added cost.
               2.2.3.4.3.2.4. Determine additive requirements to identify items not supported
               by past demand records.
                 2.2.3.4.3.2.4.1. Document and validate these requirements for authorization
38                                                              AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


                 at both the retail and wholesale levels.
                 2.2.3.4.3.2.4.2. Request authorization for additive requirements when
                 laying in stock at a base or adding stock to support a net increase in end item
                 population or in base deployments.
                 2.2.3.4.3.2.4.3. Use the additive requirement for items such as those with
                 calendar time changes, short shelf-life and short program life.
                 2.2.3.4.3.2.4.4. Request additive requirement authorization for modified
                 items and applications that can’t adapt for use with the EOQ formula.
     2.2.3.5. Consumable Item Reporting Stratification.
        2.2.3.5.1. Use stratification reports to develop item purchasing and depot
        maintenance budgets; determine readiness status of inventories; and relate assets to
        the approved acquisition objective, other authorized retention of stock, and potential
        for reusing or disposing of materiel.
            2.2.3.5.1.1. Maintain an audit trail if a method other than stratification for
            budgeting is utilized.
        2.2.3.5.2. Develop wholesale and retail dollar value stratification summaries
        outlining individual item asset and requirement comparisons. Stratify consumable
        items at least semiannually to reflect inventory as of September 30 (consulted during
        inventory reporting and funding reviews) and once to reflect inventory as of March
        31 (used for budget preparation).
     2.2.3.6. Reparable Item Computation. The AF reparable requirements computation
     system will be forward-looking using past usage that is converted to a demand rate. It
     will apply this rate to project future usage. The reparable item computation will be used
     to develop inventory stratification tables needed for budget submission and inventory
     evaluation. (T-2).
        2.2.3.6.1. Categories and Characteristics of Reparable Items:
            2.2.3.6.1.1. An item categorized as a reparable is an item of supply (except
            explosive ordnance and major end items of equipment) is subject to repair cycle
            control.
            2.2.3.6.1.2. Removal of a malfunctioning reparable item is normally followed by
            a request to supply for a replacement item.
            2.2.3.6.1.3. When the replacement request either issues or backorders, the
            removed item will normally be automatically placed under DIFM control. (T-3).
            2.2.3.6.1.4. Refer to AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 4C, Repair for DIFM return
            procedures. Categorize reparables according to the ERRC. See AFH 23-123, Vol
            1, Ch 2 for ERRCDs.
            2.2.3.6.1.5. Reparable may be both field reparable (XF3) and depot reparable
            (XD2).
        2.2.3.6.2. Requirements Computation. Requirements for spares support consists of
        the following elements. (Ref. Attach 1, Glossary for more detail on terms)
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       39

            2.2.3.6.2.10. Condemnation Requirement.
            2.2.3.6.2.11. Additive Requirement.
     2.2.3.7. Non-demand-Based Requirements. Items with limited or no-demand history, but
     qualify for stockage based on other criteria. Three types of non-demand-based
     requirements are for INS, Numeric Stockage Objective (NSO), and calendar time change
     items.
        2.2.3.7.1. No Demands. Essential items with no demands or forecast of failure will
        be identified and stocked as determined by AFMC as INS items and will not exceed
        one minimum replacement unit unless fully justified and documented. (T-2).
        2.2.3.7.2. Low or Sporadic Demands. Essential items with demands or forecast of
        failure with either low or sporadic will be treated as NSO. These items will be
        stocked in minimum quantities. (T-2).
            2.2.3.7.2.1. Additive Requirements. Additional requirements authorized for
            initial lay-in of base stocks and to support a net increase in end item population or
            planned base deployments. May be used for items such as those with calendar
            time changes, short shelf-life and short program life items, or for modifications
            and other applications that are not computing in the computation.
     2.2.3.8. Asset usage data is data necessary for the computation of requirements. Asset
     usage data will be obtained from appropriate IT systems, stock balance and consumption
     reports as well as any other official source. Asset and usage data will include: (T-2).
        2.2.3.8.1. Worldwide Assets. All serviceable and unserviceable assets, including
        DIFM and TO compliance at both wholesale and retail level.
        2.2.3.8.2. On-Order Assets. On-order assets include firm quantities due-in obtainable
        through the Interservice Supply Support Program (ISSP); items bailed to contractors;
        quantities subject to contract termination, Foreign Military Sales (FMS); customer
        excess; and assets from reclamation.
     2.2.3.9. Materiel Programs. Inventory positions or levels of activity will be expressed in
     terms of hours, months, units, overhauls or recoveries. These include:
40                                                              AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


        2.2.3.9.1. Past Programs. Statements of actual inventory or accomplishments during
        a specific past period.
        2.2.3.9.2. Projected Programs. Estimates of planned inventory and accomplishments
        during a future period.
        2.2.3.9.3. Organizational Intermediate Maintenance (OIM) Programs.
        2.2.3.9.4. Depot Level Maintenance (DLM) Programs.
     2.2.3.10. Consumption Rate Development. These rates will be computed from base
     consumption information and depot reparable generations.
        2.2.3.10.1. Base Consumption Rates. Base consumption rates will be determined by
        taking the number of failures at base level, over a specific period of time, divided by
        the operating program for that same time period. Base consumption rates include (ref.
        Attach 1, Glossary for more detail on terms):
            2.2.3.10.1.1. Total OIM Demand Rate.
            2.2.3.10.1.2. Base Condemnation Rate.
            2.2.3.10.1.3. Base NRTS Rate.
        2.2.3.10.2. Depot Consumption Rates. These rates will be computed using the
        number of failures at depot level divided by the appropriate depot program.
     2.2.3.11. New Items.
        2.2.3.11.1. Initial Requirements Quantity. This quantity will be calculated as the
        total of ERRCD XD2 items needed to support a program time span equal to the
        Procurement Lead Time (PCLT), plus an operating period of 3 months (lead time plus
        3 months), which will be at least 12 months. The operating period will allow for the
        conversion from the initial requirements computation to the recurring replenishment
        computation. Compute quantities for the operating period, base and depot repair
        cycle, and if authorized, additive requirements not covered by other segments.
     2.2.3.12. Reparable Item Stratification Reports will be generated in the applicable IT
     system from the requirements determination process. They will be used to uniformly
     portray the materiel requirements and available assets (on-hand and on-order) of
     individual items at the wholesale and retail levels.
        2.2.3.12.1. The wholesale level will develop dollar value stratification summaries
        depicting individual item asset and requirement comparisons. Reparable items will be
        stratified quarterly, unless waived. Stratification cutoff dates will be 30 Sep, 31 Dec,
        31 Mar and 30 Jun of each fiscal year.
     2.2.3.13. Centrally Managed Equipment.
        2.2.3.13.1. Criteria:
            2.2.3.13.1.1. Assigned Procurement Source Code (PSC). 5.
            2.2.3.13.1.2. Separate, primary, end item (other than the weapon itself), needed
            by an individual or organization to perform an assigned mission.
            2.2.3.13.1.3. Assigned ERRC ND or NF.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      41


         2.2.3.13.2. Equipment will be acquired to:
             2.2.3.13.2.1. Meet a specific predetermined future requirement.
             2.2.3.13.2.2. Fill an existing shortage.
             2.2.3.13.2.3. Replace a condemned item.
         2.2.3.13.3. Equipment item requirements computation will cover the conditions in
         paragraph 2.2.3.13.2 - 2.2.3.13.2.3 above; however, circumstances may arise which
         will generate requirements for equipment items other than those identified. In these
         cases, AFMC may establish levels in the equipment item requirements computation
         IAW HQ AFMC guidance.
         2.2.3.13.4. Base and depot stock levels are not authorized for centrally acquired
         equipment items. Exceptions to this policy are:
             2.2.3.13.4.1. Non-expendable individual equipment.
  2.2.4. Retention.
     2.2.4.1. Retention rules ensure proper utilization of Government property and prevent
     unnecessary procurement.
     2.2.4.2. Wholesale Stockage Retention. AFMC will: (T-2).
         2.2.4.2.1. Retain only sufficient quantities of centrally procured serviceable and
         economically reparable assets used on active DoD weapon systems and end items
         required to support the projected life of the weapon system.
         2.2.4.2.2. Retain stocks IAW DoDM 4140.01 and this AFI. (T-2).
         2.2.4.2.3. Retain serviceable assets up to the authorized Foreign Military Sales Order
         I (FMSO I) stock level to support projected Cooperative Logistics Supply Support
         Arrangement (CLSSA) program requisitions.
         2.2.4.2.4. Retain all serviceable Local Purchase (LP), Local Manufacture (LM), and
         one-time buy assets for active DoD Weapons systems and end items for 30 months
         after the last demand.
         2.2.4.2.5. Retain ample quantities of assets applicable to DoD weapons systems or
         end items to support modified or phased out items through the modification program
         or phase-out period.
         2.2.4.2.6. Retain serviceable assets peculiar to weapons systems or end items used
         solely by FMS customers pending completion of a buy-out program. Keep these
         items no longer than 2 years from the date the AF makes a buy-out offer to FMS
         customers.
         2.2.4.2.7. Consider shelf life, storage space limitations, weapons system essentiality,
         population, and projected life when deciding what to keep. Regularly review retention
         additives and ensure they have been deleted once they have served their legitimate
         purpose and are no longer justified.
         2.2.4.2.8. Asset Stratification. AFMC will stratify principal and secondary items to
         show assets against materiel requirements IAW DoD 4140.1-R for:
 42                                                              AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


              2.2.4.2.8.1. Approved Acquisition Objective (AAO) stock
              2.2.4.2.8.2. Economic Retention Stock (ERS)
                 2.2.4.2.8.2.1. ERS is developed by calculating an Economic Retention Limit
                 (ERL) which represents the maximum retention level of stock that could be
                 economically justified to meet future peacetime requirements. ERS is the
                 quantity of stock excess to the AAO requirement, but within the ERL.
                 2.2.4.2.8.2.2. True economic retention criteria, includes evaluating potential
                 future reprocurement costs, repair costs, depot survival rate, expected returns
                 from disposal of materiel, costs of storing peacetime demand expectations. To
                 warrant ERS, an item must have a reasonably predictable demand rate.
              2.2.4.2.8.3. Contingency Retention Stock (CRS).
                 2.2.4.2.8.3.1. For CRS assets that grossly impact warehouse storage space,
                 dispose upon validation that disposal will not adversely impact the AF
                 mission. The IMS documents and keeps the rationale for this decision in the
                 NSN file.
              2.2.4.2.8.4. Potential Reutilization (PR) stock.
          2.2.4.2.9. AFMC will retain wholesale assets up to the total allowable AAO, ERS,
          and CRS levels for the projected life of the weapon system or end item. (T-2).
              2.2.4.2.9.1. Support/provide AF/A4LM with AF wholesale retention data IAW
              DoD 4140.1-R. (T-0).
          2.2.4.2.10. (DELETED)
       2.2.4.3. Retail Stockage Retention. For serviceable items used to support a weapon
       system or end item in use at the retail activity, retain:
          2.2.4.3.1. Centrally procured investment ERRCD “XD2” items until the AFMC
          wholesale Inventory Management Specialist (IMS) provides disposition instructions.
2.2.4.3.2. Centrally procured field-level reparable (ERRCD code “XF”) items assigned mission
impact code (MIC) 1 and 2 for 24 months and items assigned MIC 3 and 4 for 12 months after
the last demand.
          2.2.4.3.3. Other centrally procured field-level reparable items (ERRCD code “XF”)
          for 30 months after the last demand.
          2.2.4.3.4. Economic order quantity items (ERRCD code “XB”) for 30 to 39 months
          after the last demand or 24 months after the new item record is established.
          2.2.4.3.5. All Stockage Priority Code (SPC) 5 serviceable items, with application to a
          weapon system or end item and assigned MIC 1 and 2 for 24 months and items
          assigned MIC 3 and 4 for 12 months after the last demand.
          2.2.4.3.6. LP, LM, or non-national stock numbered items for 12 months.
          2.2.4.3.7. Equipment authorization inventory data (EAID) items and specified non-
          EAID items (AS016) as long as authorized and required to perform assigned
          missions.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       43


             2.2.4.3.7.1. Authorization will be established based on an allowance standard
             (AS) or a special allowance source code (ASC), and recorded on the authorized/in
             use detail records. (T-2).
             2.2.4.3.7.2. Authorizations will be deleted when the equipment is no longer
             needed to perform the assigned mission. Retain EAID items carried on the FB/FE
             supply account as long as authorized to a support organization. (T-2).
         2.2.4.3.8. Serviceable non-EAID (retail outlet) equipment items authorized for stock
         for 30 to 39 months after the last demand or 24 months after the new item record is
         established.
         2.2.4.3.9. Inventory Control Point (ICP) unserviceable assets until receiving
         disposition instructions from the wholesale manager.
         2.2.4.3.10. Items on systems or end items no longer in use at activity or for which no
         item record is found in the materiel management IT system or requirement, report the
         items to AFMC and transfer or dispose of the assets as directed.
         2.2.4.3.11. Assets may be transferred to disposal or to the wholesale supply point
         before the required retention period expires if they exceed shelf life or storage space
         limits. Consult with the LRS CC/AO or equivalent to deviate from retention policy
         when storage space is a problem. Coordinate with AFMC before returning assets to
         the wholesale stock point.
         2.2.4.3.12. Retail activities must retain secondary items applicable to weapon
         systems and end items in use at the retail activity, up to the total allowable AAO and
         ERS levels. (T-2).
     2.2.4.4. Review PRS (Excess) prior to approval for disposal. All PRS (excess) items
     must be reviewed prior to disposal to ensure that no known or projected requirements
     exist. This review will include exploring possible needs due to next higher assembly
     (NHA) application, possible modification to a usable configuration, uses for other than its
     intended purpose and reclamation of component parts. This review may result in the
     retention of computed excess assets.
  2.2.5. Transfer Guidance. AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity will ensure that
  AF materiel management IT systems’ capabilities effectively support redistribution policy to
  effectively manage and execute the transfer of materiel. (T-2).
     2.2.5.1. Transfers within the DoD. It is DoD and AF policy that materiel assets be
     utilized within the DoD to the fullest extent practicable. NWRM assets will not be
     transferred without written approval from the Wholesale IM IAW AFI 20-110. (T-1).
     Assets of one military service shall be transferred to fill requirements of another military
     service requirement. Transfer excess AF assets to DoD activities using ISSP. Conduct
     ISSP interrogations for asset availability, offers of excess assets, and transfers.
     Interservice transfers will be handled IAW AFMC guidance. (T-2).
     2.2.5.2. Transfers to Allied Forces. Transfers to Allied Forces are accomplished
     according to FMS policy and procedures contained in DoD 5105.38-M, Security
     Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) and DoD 7000.14-R. It is DoD policy that
     defense articles offered and sold to foreign governments and international organizations
44                                                             AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


     reflect favorably upon the U.S. Articles offered and sold under FMS will normally be
     new or unused, or as a result of rehabilitation, possess original appearance insofar as
     possible and, as a minimum, have serviceability standards prescribed for issue to U.S.
     forces. (T-0).
     2.2.5.3. CLSSA.
        2.2.5.3.1. During peacetime conditions, a CLSSA is the normal means for providing
        follow-on logistics support for equipment of U.S. origin that is in allied or friendly
        country inventories. Under CLSSA procedures participating countries "buy into" the
        DoD inventory. Recurring CLSSA demands for secondary items shall be included in
        the computational system for forecasting CLSSA requirements. Assets shall be both
        stocked and maintained on order from procurement in anticipation of FMS country
        requisitions. (T-2).
        2.2.5.3.2. When assets are transferred under matured CLSSAs, the sales are made
        from DoD inventory financed by CLSSA funds, and the materiel cost shall be
        reimbursable at full stock list price. (T-2).
        2.2.5.3.3. Materiel sold through FMS under matured CLSSAs shall be given equal
        treatment with AF requisitions (within priority) for on-hand and on-order depot
        stocks. (T-2).
        2.2.5.3.4. Materiel requests received prior to maturation of the CLSSA are
        considered non- CLSSA requirements and shall not be provided the same priority as
        CLSSA requirements. (T-2). Materiel may be released, but not normally below the
        control level to fill non-CLSSA requirements.
        2.2.5.3.5. On an exception basis, materiel may be transferred from stocks below the
        control level to fill non-CLSSA requirements if release of the stocks will not
        adversely affect the support of U.S. Forces (such issues shall not be below the safety
        level). (T-2).
     2.2.5.4. Nonstandard Support. Under nonstandard support procedures the customer's
     materiel requirements are normally filled from procurement rather than from DoD stocks.
     Nonstandard support includes hardware or services required to support commercial end
     items; DoD obsolete end items, including end items that have undergone system support
     buy outs; and selected non-U.S. origin military equipment. In the event assets are
     available from DoD inventories, and the transfer out of stock will not adversely impact
     the support of U.S. Forces, materiel costs shall be reimbursable as follows: (T-2).
        2.2.5.4.1. When assets are within the AAO, materiel costs shall be recouped at full
        stock list price.
        2.2.5.4.2. When assets exceed the AAO and have not been procured in anticipation
        of military assistance or sales requirements as a result of CLSSAs, or pursuant to a
        military assistance or sales order, they are termed Excess Defense Articles and shall
        be sold in an "as is" condition at excess prices exhibited in DoD 7000.14-R, Volume
        15.
        2.2.5.4.3. All FMS requirements for nonstandard support will be excluded from the
        demand base of the respective computational systems. Materiel shall not be procured
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       45


        nor retained in stock in anticipation of FMS transfers under nonstandard support
        procedures.
     2.2.5.5. Transfers to Federal Civil Agencies.
        2.2.5.5.1. With the exception of DoD excess materiel, the transfer of assets to
        agencies outside the DoD shall require reimbursement IAW DOD 7000.14-R. (T-0).
            2.2.5.5.1.1. Transfers of stock fund items shall be priced at the current stock list
            price. (T-2).
            2.2.5.5.1.2. Transfers of non-stock fund items below the AAO shall be priced at
            the estimated replacement cost of the item minus an adjustment for age and
            condition of the item being sold, if applicable. (T-2).
            2.2.5.5.1.3. Transfers of non-stock fund items above the AAO shall be priced at
            the current stock list price minus an adjustment for age and condition of the item
            being sold, if applicable. (T-2).
        2.2.5.5.2. Transfers of DoD excess materiel shall be non-reimbursable and are not
        normally authorized from DoD stocks. (T-0). Such transfers are the responsibility of
        the DLADS IAW DoD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual.
        2.2.5.5.3. Transfers of DoD non-lethal surplus property may be made to the
        Department of State for humanitarian relief purposes pursuant to the Federal Used
        Property for Domestic Use Act of 1990 (reference Title 40, United States Code,
        Chapter 48 (as amended), Section 203 - Federal Property and Administrative Services
        Act of 1949). Such transfers are the responsibility of the DLADS IAW DoD 4160.21-
        M.
     2.2.5.6. Transfer of Cryptologic Materiel.
        2.2.5.6.1. Transfers of peculiar cryptologic materiel, including communications
        security materiel shall be accomplished IAW National Security Agency/Central
        Security Service regulations. (T-2). The AFMC Cryptological System Activity has
        overall responsibility for cryptologic materiel management within the AF. They have
        item management responsibility for cryptologic materiel and peculiar items related to
        cryptologic equipment.
        2.2.5.6.2. Transfers of common cryptologic materiel. Items of supply having
        application to both cryptologic and non-cryptologic equipment and obtained from
        supply sources other than AFMC Cryptological System Activity shall follow normal
        AF policy and procedures. (T-2).
     2.2.5.7. Wholesale Level Redistributable Material
        2.2.5.7.1. Review PRS (Excess) prior to approval for disposal. All potential
        reutilization (excess) items must be reviewed prior to disposal to ensure that no
        known or projected requirements exist. T-2).
            2.2.5.7.1.1. This review will include exploring possible needs due to NHA
            application, possible modification to a usable configuration, uses for other than its
            intended purpose and reclamation of component parts.
46                                                              AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


            2.2.5.7.1.2. This review may result in the retention of computed excess assets.
     2.2.5.8. Base level redistributable material guidance for AF Serviceable Centrally
     Procured Items.
        2.2.5.8.1. Quantities with ERRC code of "XD2” which exceed the base
        requisitioning objective, are available for redistribution. This also applies to:
            2.2.5.8.1.1. AFMC Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Activity, except
            for items contained in their storage account.
            2.2.5.8.1.2. Equipment items (ERRCD coded "ND2"and "NF2"), except for
            controlled item code "N" and/or "4" (pilferable/sensitive), qualify for
            redistribution when assets on-hand, plus due-in, exceed quantities authorized to
            all activities supported by the base. Items coded "N" and/or "4"
            (pilferable/sensitive) will be reported to the item manager (IM).
        2.2.5.8.2. The quantity of materiel support division stock fund items above the
        requisitioning objective will be reported provided the extended line item value is $20
        or greater. (T-2).
     2.2.5.9. Base level redistributable material guidance for AF Unserviceable (Reparable)
     Centrally Procured Items.
        2.2.5.9.1. Items coded "XD2," beyond base repair capability, will be processed as
        directed by AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 4C, Repair, or as indicated in the reparable item
        movement control system. (T-2).
        2.2.5.9.2. Normally, items coded "XF3" and "XB3," which are not feasible to repair
        or recondition at local level, are authorized for processing to DLADS without
        reporting to the IM. Ensure Control Codes do not require special actions/processing.
        2.2.5.9.3. Items coded "ND," beyond base repair capability, will be reported to the
        IM.      Reparable "NF" items, controlled          item codes "N" and/or "4"
        (pilferable/sensitive) beyond base repair capability, will be reported to the item
        manager regardless of unit/extended dollar value. Reparable "NF2" items, other than
        controlled item code "N" and/or "4," beyond base repair capability, will be processed
        to DLADS when the extended line item value is less than $100.00; items $100 and
        over will be reported to the IM. (T-2).
     2.2.5.10. Reporting redistributable serviceable AF centrally procured items.
        2.2.5.10.1. Items coded "XD2" are to be reported to AFMC. Redistribution of these
        items is determined by AFMC.
        2.2.5.10.2. Items coded "XF3" and "XB3" will be reported as detected by the

     2.3.2.3. Identical items will not be simultaneously included in more than one AFWCF
     division. (T-2).
     2.3.2.4. Inventory Valuation. Serviceable and unserviceable assets will be valued at
     moving average cost, which is included in the asset record in the retail and wholesale
     supply systems. (T-2).
     2.3.2.5. Price Stabilization. Price stabilization is the policy wherein the Standard Price
     (SP) of each cataloged asset remains constant throughout each fiscal year. WCF prices
     for a given execution year are fixed to protect the customer funds from unforeseen
     fluctuations that would affect their ability to purchase the programs approved by
     Congress. The prices established for CSAG-S assets are set on an annual basis to recover
     the cost of doing business. There are instances where an error resulted in a gross
54                                                             AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


     misstatement of a price is identified and after analysis, may be changed if the magnitude
     to the customer or the WCF is significant and after weighing other circumstances.
         2.3.2.5.1. New assets that enter the supply system during the year have all prices
         computed and distributed through the next available monthly stock list change cycle.
         These changes for assets entering the inventory after the 1 Oct effective date along
         with significant price error changes are authorized deviations from the stabilized
         pricing concept.
     2.3.2.6. Point of Sale. For non-fly AF customer orders and all non AF orders, customer
     funds are obligated at the time an order is placed with base or depot supply. For flying
     hour orders from approved AF flying hour customers, flying hour appropriated funds
     must be available before billings occur based on actual hours flown, and are obligated at
     the beginning of the month billings are to occur. (T-2). CSAG-M is not charged for any
     CSAG- S assets ordered and consumed in performing organic maintenance activities.
     However, CSAG-M does pay for all GSD items ordered.
  2.3.3. The General Support Division (GSD).
     2.3.3.1. The GSD includes all retail-managed (Budget Code [BC] 9) expense items
     acquired primarily from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).
     2.3.3.2. The local GSD outlet will act as the procuring agent for expense items required
     to satisfy either inventory levels or due-outs to customer organizations. Customer funds
     will not be cited for GSD items (unless specifically authorized by AFMC) on
     procurement documents issued to commercial vendors, DLA, GSA or other suppliers
     except for initial procurement by the AFWCF as authorized in AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Ch 18.
     2.3.3.3. The designated accounting IT system consolidates general ledger balances,
     which are transmitted to DFAS for consolidating and reporting to MAJCOM, division
     and higher levels of authority. See DFAS-DE 7077.4, Standard Materiel Accounting
     System User's Manual for procedures.
     2.3.3.4. Reimbursable Issues. All transactions by which customers obtain materiel from
     the GSD are considered issues and/or sales. All issues to authorized customers will be
     reimbursed to the GSD from appropriations or other approved sources of reimbursement
     except for non-reimbursable issues specifically authorized by AFMC and SAF. (T-1).
     Cost Per Flying Hour (CPFH) items ordered and filled will be reimbursed centrally by the
     customer on a monthly basis based on hours flown. Authorized customers include
     contractor, appropriated, and non-appropriated fund activities. Expense items brought
     into the SMAG from sources outside the normal AF supply channels at no cost to the
     SMAG will be processed as a receipt without charge and issues require reimbursement,
     except as authorized by Para. 2.3.3.6 (T-2).
     2.3.3.5. Nonreimbursable Transactions.
         2.3.3.5.1. The issue, shipment and/or transfer of GSD items are authorized without
         reimbursement for the following situations:
            2.3.3.5.1.1. To approved Security Assistance Programs (SAP grant aid) when
            materiel is in excess of approved force acquisition objectives.
            2.3.3.5.1.2. Excess property with a SP of less than $3,000 to an accountable
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     55


           materiel management officer of another military service or defense agency. This
           does not apply to issues within the Air Force.
           2.3.3.5.1.3. Excess items resulting from base closure and identified as designated
           as personal property required by the community’s land use plan. Transfers are
           coordinated through base civil engineering.
           2.3.3.5.1.4. Equipment items are authorized free issue/shipment as follows:
              2.3.3.5.1.4.1. Redistribution Order (RDO) of on-hand items that have
              completed the mandatory reporting cycle and are directed for disposal.
              2.3.3.5.1.4.2. Issue of excesses received through the applicable materiel
              management IT system RDOs when the customer has a memo backorder
              established prior to receipt processing.
              2.3.3.5.1.4.3. If the SMAG is previously reimbursed, in-stock equipment may
              be free issued when the requesting organization has a valid authorization.
              Note: Verification must be performed to ensure a receipt-not-due-in or
              backorder cancellation without a direct customer charge was processed in the
              last 365 days. (T-3). If either condition exists, the item cannot be free issued
              until the criteria in Para 2.3.3.6.1.4.4 are met.
              2.3.3.5.1.4.4. Prior to granting free issue every attempt should be made to sell
              items at a reduced price. Equipment-in-stock without previous reimbursement
              from the customer must remain in stock for 365 days prior to free issuing. (T-
              3). Free issues are authorized after 365 days. Note: The LRS CC/AO and/or
              funds manager may elect to retain property, if they believe there is a potential
              future sale.
           2.3.3.5.1.5. Items may be withdrawn from DLADS to satisfy specific customer
           requirements and issued without reimbursement regardless of supply asset
           position. Returns from DLADS to fill stock levels will require reimbursement
           upon subsequent issue.
              2.3.3.5.1.5.1. Unserviceable assets may be withdrawn from the local DLADS
              without reimbursement regardless of the supply asset position. The LRS
              CC/AO or his/her designated representative will authorize all withdrawals to
              ensure that the requirement is valid. (T-3).
              2.3.3.5.1.5.2. Items located in other than the local DLADS may be withdrawn
              when a valid memo backorder exists and is issued without reimbursement. To
              ensure proper use of transportation funds, the following restrictions apply to
              withdrawals from other than local DLADS units:
                2.3.3.5.1.5.2.1. The item must have a valid NSN. (T-3).
                2.3.3.5.1.5.2.2. The extended cost of the item requisitioned must be greater
                than $500. Exceptions to this must be approved by the LRS CC/AO. (T-3).
                2.3.3.5.1.5.2.3. The requisitioner is responsible for providing transportation
                funds for movement of the assets requisitioned from DLADS.
           2.3.3.5.1.6. If the entire on-hand quantity of an item is excess (i.e. its mandatory
56                                                              AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


            reporting cycle is completed and is authorized for transfer to DLADS) any portion
            of this quantity may be issued without reimbursement. Issue of partial excess
            items that are over and above a stock level for the same item requires
            reimbursement.
            2.3.3.5.1.7. Shop/laboratory type equipment (NF2, BC9) with an established
            equipment authorization and immediate need may be issued without
            reimbursement when received from contract termination without cost to the
            SMAG. This authorization does not apply to administrative and housekeeping
            type equipment.
            2.3.3.5.1.8. Issue of an unserviceable GSD item for an unsatisfactory report
            exhibit or for shipments to another Service or contractor when the item will not be
            returned to the issuing activity. (T-3).
            2.3.3.5.1.9. Issue of an unserviceable GSD item for a Deficiency Report when the
            AF will not receive credit. The issue will be processed as materiel returns for
            credit. Current DLA credit return policy consists of the SP minus the DLA
            surcharge. (T-3).
            2.3.3.5.1.10. Nonreimbursable transactions will be reviewed to determine
            whether any were unauthorized. Unauthorized nonreimbursable issues will be
            reversed and the transaction processed correctly so that the appropriate customers
            are billed.
     2.3.3.6. Procedures to free issue/ship assets are detailed in AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2C,
     Financial Management.
     2.3.3.7. Credit Guidance. Credit for items with Expendability, Recoverability,
     Reparability Category Designator (ERRCD) "XB_" and "XF_," BC 9 will be allowed for
     all serviceable “XB_” and “XF_” assets as stated below and as indicated in AFMAN 23-
     122, Sec. 2B, Financial Management. Credit will not be allowed for other than
     serviceable “XB_” and “XF_” assets returned by any customer except as stated later in
     this section.
        2.3.3.7.1. GSD “XB_” automatic credit guidance. Grant 100% credit up to the
        requisitioning objective minus the on-hand plus due-in assets, and grant a graduated
        percentage of credit up to the requisitioning objective plus 2 years of demand (daily
        demand rate times 730). The percents will vary by the amount of previous demands.
        2.3.3.7.2. GSD “XF_” automatic credit guidance. Returns of serviceable “XF_”
        assets with a DIFM detail minus those as a result of DLADS withdrawals are
        considered returns with a sale. These returns will be granted 100% credit up to the
        requisitioning objective minus the on-hand plus due-in assets. Returns of “XF” assets
        FOB or as a result of a DLADS withdrawal will be credited 100% up to the
        requisitioning objective minus the on-hand plus due-in assets and a predetermined
        percentage of credit up to the requisitioning objective plus 2 years of demand (daily
        demand rate times 730). The percents will vary by the amount of previous demands.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      57


        2.3.3.7.3. The credit guidance on return of expense equipment (BC 9) to the GSD is
        100 percent for serviceable returns of non-EAID (retail sales) items if the quantity
        turned in is within the stock level or there is a known requirement.
     2.3.3.8. Conditional Policies for Special Areas of Support. Within the AF, there are
     various special procedures in existence that furnish logistics support for peculiar
     requirements that are not provided in the normal manner.
        2.3.3.8.1. Local purchase (LP) support for overseas activities. LP actions will follow
        procedures prescribed in AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 3B, Local Purchase and Retail Sales.
        2.3.3.8.2. Local purchase minimum quantity buys. When the GSD is required to
        purchase a minimum quantity of an item that is greater than the actual need, only the
        quantity requested by the customer will be issued. The balance of the minimum
        quantity of purchase should be retained in the local GSD account. At the expiration of
        the retention period, disposition will be taken as prescribed in this instruction.
        2.3.3.8.3. When items are to be assembled by an AFMC Air Logistics Complex,
        GSD items will normally not be requisitioned until 90 days prior to outshipment.
        Waivers for earlier requisitioning must be approved by AFMC and/or SAF.
        2.3.3.8.4. Disaster preparedness decontaminants. All decontaminants for disaster
        preparedness will be expensed upon receipt to a designated/requiring organization.
     2.3.3.9. Transfer of inventory responsibility for SMAG-R items between Services,
     agencies, divisions etc., will be processed as capitalization/decapitalization transactions
     with funds provided by the capitalizing organization to reimburse the losing organization.
     2.3.3.10. Disposition of GSD Items. Excess items managed by integrated managers
     (e.g., DLA) will be referred to the integrated item manager for disposition instructions
     when the item meets the reporting criteria of this instruction. The decision of the AFMC
     IM will be followed regardless if credit is or is not allowed for materiel returned.
     Transportation costs associated with return of excess materiel to the item manager will be
     borne by GSD. Refer to AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2B, Stockage Procedure for procedures on
     the disposition of excess items. (T-2).
     2.3.3.11. Repair of GSD Items.
        2.3.3.11.1. GSD items normally will not be subject to repair by the local GSD
        maintenance activity. Items in inventory, whose serviceability is determined doubtful
        by inspection due to mishandling while in stock such as being dropped, should be
        repaired as an O&M expense to the LRS CC/AO's account. Transportation costs for
        shipment of GSD items to a contractor for repair or servicing is charged to the O&M
        appropriation as stated in AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Chapter 18. 2.3.3.11.2. The only items
        that are to be repaired at GSD expense are those items returned as unserviceable and
        later a subsequent requirement developed and repair of the item is authorized in lieu
        of new procurement. For assets not owned by the GSD, the owning organization pays
        all associated cost for repair, cleaning and transportation. When it is appropriate for
        the GSD to pay for repair of items in stock, the transaction should be processed as
        repair expense.
58                                                             AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


     2.3.3.12. Assembly/Disassembly Involving GSD Items. Assembly is the process of
     combining two or more separately identified articles and the re-identification of this
     grouping to a new identity. Because the general type of item involved in the GSD is
     considered to be a "bit and piece," there should only be rare instances when the
     assembled item would be a GSD article. Normally, the resultant article will be identified
     as an investment item or a CSAG-S reparable item. The assembled article will be
     returned and processed as a return to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity. If the
     return is a GSD item, it will be subject to a credit determination under program control.
     When the assembled article is identified as an investment item it will process as a non-
     GSD transaction; therefore, it will not involve the credit determination. Disassembly is
     the reverse process of assembly. The "bit and piece" component part will be processed as
     a return subject to a credit determination under program control.
     2.3.3.13. Contract Termination Cost Guidance. Termination costs for GSD commercial
     vendor (LP) items resulting from cancellation of LP items will be absorbed by the GSD.
     2.3.3.14. Management of local manufacture and Life of System Stock (LSS) items.
     These stocks are normally bought as a package and furnished with an end article for the
     specific purpose of providing spares support for the life of the end article or system.
     Refer to AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2C, Financial Management for procedures on local
     manufacture and LSS items.
     2.3.3.15. Temporary Loan of GSD Equipment. For loan policy, refer to AFI 23-119,
     Management of Government Furnished Property.
     2.3.3.16. War Reserve Materiel/Readiness Spares Packages. WRM funds for
     procurement of new WRM requirements are specifically authorized through the
     budgeting process.
        2.3.3.16.1. The approved WRM obligation authority provided by the GSD manager
        for ordering initial WRM shortages is a firm limitation and must not be exceeded.
        Requirements in excess of approved obligation authority must be forwarded to the
        AFMC GSD manager for additional authority. (T-2).
        2.3.3.16.2. When WRM items are used to satisfy Mission Capable (MICAP)
        requirements, these items are replaced with GSD operating obligations authority.
        WRM items should be rotated with like peacetime assets to the extent possible to
        assure their continued serviceability. If however, WRM assets become unusable or
        outdated, replacement is considered an initial procurement of new WRM and must be
        acquired with GSD WRM obligation authority and identified to AFMC GSD
        functional office on the GSD Operating Program for additional WRM funding. For
        WRM Funding Procedures refer to AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2C, Financial Management.
        Also refer to AFI 25-101 for specific stock fund budgeting and programming
        procedures for WRM, Fuels Operational Readiness Capability Equipment (FORCE)
        and Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR).
     2.3.3.17. For Shipment/Disposition of Defective GSD Items. AFMC will determine
     when a defective GSD item should be returned to a vendor/contractor or other
     disposition. AFMC activities will assure that GSD items are properly accounted for when
     dropped from GSD inventory in order to prevent the loss of GSD property.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     59


     2.3.3.18. Unit Price. Unit prices for GSD items locally procured or manufactured will be
     developed at retail/base level using the instructions for computing SPs in subsequent
     paragraphs. (T-3).
         2.3.3.18.1. Use of SPs. Each item financed under a GSD shall have a SP which will
         be effecting reimbursements for sale or issue. There will be no reductions to the item
         record SPs in the GSD. (T-2).
         2.3.3.18.2. SPs for items will consist of the product cost, a percentage to recover
         transportation charges, inventory losses and other expenses authorized for payment
         by the GSD. (T-2).
  2.3.4. Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group (CSAG) - Supply Division Working Capital
  Fund (CSAG-S). CSAG-S is a division of CSAG of the AFWCF. The CSAG-S operates
  under a revolving fund or working capital fund concept whereby inventories are held and
  sold to customers. AF assets stocked at depots and bases belong to CSAG-S until sold to the
  customer. This includes RSP assets.
     2.3.4.1. AF-managed reparable and design unstable consumable assets fall under the
     umbrella of CSAG-S. CSAG-S embraces a multi-tiered pricing framework to recover the
     cost of acquisition, repair, and related wholesale overhead expenses. CSAG-S prices are
     established annually.
     2.3.4.2. Business Operations funds the day-to-day operating costs of CSAG-S. The
     BOCR recovers costs that CSAG-S pays for ICP and Headquarters (HQ) /Command level
     operations.
     2.3.4.3. CSAG-S Scope.
         2.3.4.3.1. CSAG-S encompasses all wholesale managed (BC "8") items acquired
         primarily from commercial suppliers and other DoD services. It also includes non-
         reparable fabricated (local manufacture) items when local manufacture by depot
         maintenance is the preferred means of procurement. Assets will be used by other than
         depot maintenance and most bases do not have the capability to fabricate.
         2.3.4.3.2. Certain assets have been excluded from CSAG-S because of the special
         management procedures associated with them. Central procurement accounts
         continue to finance these assets. All requests for program exclusion from CSAG-S are
         processed through AFMC to SAF/FMBM for approval. Assets excluded from CSAG-
         S are:
            2.3.4.3.2.1. Classified Program Reparables. These assets have a BC “@." Note:
            This does not include assets that may be part of a program that is intended to be
            managed in a non-classified logistics support environment.
            2.3.4.3.2.2. Assets Managed in the AF Combat Ammunition System (CAS).
            2.3.4.3.2.3. All Federal Supply Class 1377 assets. These are cartridge and
            propellant actuated devices and components.
            2.3.4.3.2.4. All BC “H” or “U” assets, which are budget program (BP) 35,
            otherwise referred to as munitions assets.
            2.3.4.3.2.5. All BC “B” assets, which are BP 17, otherwise referred to as war
60                                                                AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


            consumable spares. These include auxiliary fuel tanks, missile launchers, pylons,
            ejector racks, and adapters that are consumed during contingency operations and
            peacetime operations.
            2.3.4.3.2.6. All BC “K” assets which are BP 83, otherwise referred to as
            cryptographic/cryptologic assets managed by Air Force Intelligence Surveillance
            and Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA).
            2.3.4.3.2.7. Spares for government furnished re-competition support packages
            associated with contractor logistics support.
            2.3.4.3.2.8. Aircraft whole engine spares (BP 16 only).
            2.3.4.3.2.9. Missile/drone whole turbojet engine spares (BP 26 only).
            2.3.4.3.2.10. Missile whole rocket engine spares (BP 25).
            2.3.4.3.2.11. Missile Telemetry packages that are not recovered for repair (BP 25
            only).
            2.3.4.3.2.12. Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits.
            2.3.4.3.2.13. Pods that are cataloged for control purposes only. These assets were
            procured with program funds, not replenishment spares funds, and will not be
            stocked, stored or issued.
            2.3.4.3.2.14. Minuteman and Peacekeeper Missile Guidance Sets.
            2.3.4.3.2.15. Contractor ICP BC “S” assets.
     2.3.4.4. Inventory and Capital Control.
        2.3.4.4.1. The AF finances materiel support inventories using a revolving fund
        concept. When a customer orders and receives a CSAG-S non-fly asset (and all non
        AF customer orders), customer funds are used to reimburse the CSAG-S. For flying
        hour orders from approved AF flying hour customers, flying hour appropriated funds
        are billed (monthly) based on actual hours flown.
        2.3.4.4.2. CSAG-S operates on the premise of self-replenishment without periodic
        appropriations. An exception is new weapon or operating systems that require cash
        infusion, through initial appropriations.
     2.3.4.5. CSAG-S WCF Prices and Costs. CSAG-S uses a multi-tiered pricing and cost
     structure. Prices and costs are normally computed for all CSAG-S items once a year
     during the budget process utilizing the appropriate IT system computation cycle. All
     prices are updated annually and forwarded to the bases with a 1 Oct effective date. The
     SP, exchange price, and unserviceable asset price are part of the stock list records that are
     provided to the customer. There is one price and two costs for AF-managed ERRC “N”
     and “P” consumable items. There are four prices and six costs for ERRC “T” reparable
     items.
     2.3.4.6. The various computed prices and costs are effective 1 Oct each year and remain
     constant throughout the fiscal year except for approved Price Verification challenges
     and/or significant cost updates/increases.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       61


     2.3.4.7. Interchangeability & Substitutability (I&S) Group (I&SG). Each price and cost
     is computed once a year for each CSAG-S I&S Subgroup Master (SGM) stock number. If
     the subgroup is one-way interchangeable, each one-way interchangeable stock number
     will have its own price, unless someone (usually the Item Manager) changes them to be
     the same. If it is a two-way interchangeable, all items in the group will have the same
     price as the SGM that heads the two-way interchangeable group.
     2.3.4.8. Price Corrections. Under certain very narrowly defined circumstances, AFMC
     can authorize immediate standard/exchange price reductions/increases on specific NSNs
     to promote better overall supply management and reduce excess inventory. However,
     usually price changes are only approved due to a gross error in the original price
     calculation.
     2.3.4.9. Credit Indicators.
        2.3.4.9.1. Credit indicators will be used to identify when credit can be given for
        return of an asset without an established DIFM.
        2.3.4.9.2. Credit is allowed if an asset is in a projected buy in the apportionment year,
        budget year, or extended year. This means that credit is allowed if an asset is in a buy
        position projected from the current point in time to three years out.
        2.3.4.9.3. LRS/Materiel Management Activities may force credit to retail customers,
        but local managers must consider the effect on CSAG-S to prevent skewing the
        overall buy computation process and the creation of imbalances in CSAG-S to the
        greatest extent possible.
            2.3.4.9.3.1. To ensure integrity of the process, forced credit procedures will not
            be used at the retail level unless the forced credit is for the return of an item
            issued in error.
            2.3.4.9.3.2. This procedure is applicable only if the LRS/Materiel Management
            Activity made the error and cannot perform a record reversal. All forced credit
            transactions must be approved prior to processing. For retail, the approving
            authority is the LRS SMAG Stock Fund Manager and at the wholesale retail level
            it is the appropriate budget office. For all other circumstances, forced credit
            override must be approved by AFMC.
     2.3.4.10. Free Issue. A non-reimbursable or free issue of an asset could potentially result
     in a lost sale that has a significant impact on the ability of CSAG-S to stock, store, and
     issue materiel for all customers. To this end, non-reimbursable issues of assets will be
     made only in exceptional circumstances. Retail WCF managers do not have the authority
     to free issue CSAG-S assets unless previously authorized by AFMC. Units must submit
     free issue requests to the AFMC. Reference free issue procedures in AFMAN 23-122,
     Sec. 5B, Order and Requisitioning.
     2.3.4.11. CSAG-S and Depot Repair. The AFMC depot maintenance function is financed
     under the CSAG-M Division of the AFWCF. CSAG-M finances depot operations in
     support of its customers. CSAG-M is both a customer of and a supplier to the CSAG-S.
        2.3.4.11.1. CSAG-M as a Customer. One of the main tenets of CSAG is to eliminate
        internal billings between CSAG divisions. As a result, CSAG-M is provided
62                                                               AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


        serviceable spares for the repair of higher assemblies at no cost. Organic depot
        maintenance normally requisitions CSAG-S parts through depot supply using the
        DIFM process.
        2.3.4.11.2. In order to recover the cost of CSAG-S assets used during repair, the cost
        of the assets used is included in the materiel portion of CSAG-M End Item Sales
        Prices (EISP).
     2.3.4.12. Contract Depot Maintenance (CDM). CSAG-S also obtains repair services
     from non-Organic sources. The repair cost of an item repaired by contract is factored into
     the average latest repair cost (LRC) of an item that is recovered in the item's sales price.
     The LRC is a weighted cost determined by the cost to repair an item organically,
     contractually or dual sourced based on the percentage of repair accomplished by each.
        2.3.4.12.1. Reparable item CDM contracts will be funded through CSAG-S or O&M,
        Depot Procured Equipment Maintenance (DPEM) funds. When a decision is made to
        provide CSAG-S assets on a DPEM-funded repair contract as Government Furnished
        Material (GFM), the CSAG-S must be reimbursed at the appropriate price (standard,
        exchange, unserviceable asset, etc.) depending on the maintenance being performed,
        the condition required and/or whether a carcass is planned to be returned. CSAG-S
        absorbs the cost of GFM when the contract is for CSAG-S repair workload. This cost
        will be recovered at the time the asset is sold.
        2.3.4.12.2. The wholesale IM must approve/disapprove release of CSAG-S asset for
        use as GFM.
        2.3.4.12.3. Besides the above, consideration must be given for two categories of
        returned GFM.
            2.3.4.12.3.1. Serviceable GFM Returns. These returns go through the normal
            issue and return process.
            2.3.4.12.3.2. Excess GFM or Asset Removals. Excess GFM or asset removals, as
            a result of 100% replacement or modification, will be returned IAW AFMC
            procedural guidance.
     2.3.4.13. Missing Assets. AF activities will not return end items to the depot for repair
     with missing components or parts unless an exception has been negotiated with the
     AFMC end IM before movement of the end item from the activity to the depot. Likewise,
     AF depot repair activities will not return end items with missing components or parts to
     operational AF activities unless an exception has been negotiated with the AFMC end IM
     and the affected MAJCOM. Materiel costs for missing items are not normally contained
     in the CSAG-M rates since AF policy dictates that the above all components and parts
     will be returned with the end item unless otherwise negotiated as described above. As a
     consequence, replacement of missing parts would be considered a change to the
     negotiated work requirements and the CSAG-M is authorized to negotiate a change to the
     stabilized end item sale price of the workload being performed. Procedures to address
     missing assets are in AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 4C, Repair.
     2.3.4.14. Stock Funding of Initial Spares. To obtain the necessary stock funding of initial
     spares, the program management community will identify the initial spares requirements
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                         63


     in conjunction with developing the cost estimate for the program. Appropriated funds
     will reimburse CSAG-S as initial spares parts deliver.
     2.3.4.15. AFMC Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Activity Assets. The removal
     or reclamation of reparable assets from the AFMC Aerospace Maintenance and
     Regeneration Activity to satisfy valid requirements is accomplished only through the
     wholesale IM in conjunction with the single manager. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2C,
     Financial Management for removal/reclamation procedures.
     2.3.4.16. Contractor Logistics Support (CLS). CLS spare parts are budgeted and funded
     within the central procurement accounts, or as an alternative, can be replenished from
     Fund 3400, EEIC 578. The AFMC CLS Manager needs to advise MAJCOMs of
     increased costs needed to cover those Depot Level Reparables (DLR) currently being
     issued under CLS. There are two types of CLS requirements:
        2.3.4.16.1. Stocklisted assets managed by AFMC that are used on CLS systems.
        Generally, this would be an asset common to both a CLS and non-CLS weapon
        system.
        2.3.4.16.2. Non-stocklisted assets bought as spares packages that are government
        owned materiel used by contractors in performance of CLS contracts. These
        requirements are funded with central procurement funds.
     2.3.4.17. Foreign Military Sales. FMS customers can participate in the AF logistics
     system through the CLSSA. The AF also provides support for requirements that are not
     part of a CLSSA. The AF primarily uses a repair and replace concept where the country
     returns a reparable carcass and is issued a serviceable asset from the normal supply
     system. For FMS reparable support, refer to Sec. 9D, Security Assistance of this
     instruction.
     2.3.4.18. ICS. The CSAG-S does not pay for the cost of depot repair of assets under ICS,
     nor does the CSAG-S collect repair cost from the customer for assets under ICS. Until the
     assets transition to organic depot repair, the carcass cost for these assets is computed
     assuming a depot repair cost of zero. This prevents CSAG-S from collecting repair funds
     that are not required. Therefore, only the operational costs are recovered by CSAG-S.
     Given this, the IT system shows the LAC and carcass cost as equal until the asset
     transitions to organic depot repair. If any portion of an asset's repair is funded by ICS, the
     asset is treated as 100% ICS. If an ICS item is scheduled to transition to organic repair
     during a given fiscal year, the LRC is established as a percentage of the contractor’s
     repair cost (dependent on when the item transitions).
     2.3.4.19. Loans. A CSAG-S asset may only be loaned to activities for the purposes
     specified in DoD 7000.14R, Volume 4, Chapter 4. Loans must be for reverse
     engineering, sample parts, and/or if in the best interest of the CSAG-S. For specific loan
     procedures, refer to AFI 23-119.
     2.3.4.20. Local Purchase/Local Repair. Local Purchase/Local Repair are not considered
     standard business practices within the CSAG-S. If these options are elected, they must
     follow the guidance of this instruction. The wholesale IM must provide a CSAG-S funds
     cite.
64                                                               AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


     2.3.4.21. Product Improvement. The Improved Item Replacement Program (IIRP)
     combines the preferred spares and 100% replacement program into one integrated effort.
     IIRP offers the AF a way to correct deficiencies, replace obsolete assets, and/or
     introduce, through technology insertion, state-of-the-art components such as line
     replacement units (LRUs) and shop-replaceable units (SRUs) that are stocked, stored, and
     issued as assets of supply. The IIRP covers both installs and spares in support of the
     installed assets. IIRP assets must be a form, fit, and function replacement for the old
     asset.
     2.3.4.22. RSP Requirement and Funding Guidance. Refer to Sec. 2F, Readiness Spares
     Packages and Kits of this instruction for additional information and AFMAN 23-122,
     Sec. 2F, Readiness Spares Packages and Kits, for procedures on deployed weapon/
     operating systems and their associated RSP assets.
     2.3.4.23. Sixty-Day Rule. Exchange customers are charged the exchange price in
     anticipation that the customer will return an unserviceable asset for repair within 60 days.
     After 60 days the customer is charged an additional amount, the Mark-Up Price (MUP),
     if either a serviceable or unserviceable asset is not turned in. The MUP represents the
     difference between the SP and the exchange price. The MUP will be reimbursed to the
     customer upon receipt of a reparable asset after 60 days to clear the DIFM detail. A delay
     in the 60-day clock occurs for awaiting parts (AWPs) when the asset status changes from
     “in work” to “AWP.” This capability is programmed into the supply system to operate in
     an automatic mode. When the item status changes back to “in work,” the 60-day clock
     resumes. The intent of this guidance is to allow the customer time, based on the status of
     the item, before the full price of the item is charged. Other DIFMs status codes are
     exempt from the 60-day rule. For a list of these codes refer to the AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch
     2. As with related activities to flying hour and internal CSAG activity, CPFH and
     CSAG-M do not have to have additional resources for MUP due to the financial
     relationship with those entities.
     2.3.4.24. Special Cases - Repair. Services in support of CSAG-S assets are funded by
     CSAG-S. These services include: first article testing, condition checks, TO verification
     and validation, reclamation, on-site test station refurbishment, and other services as
     approved on a case-by-case basis.
     2.3.4.25. Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM).
        2.3.4.25.1. Initial/Increased SPRAM Requirement.
            2.3.4.25.1.1. The initial issue of SPRAM will be provided free of charge by the
            PM. For the purposes of this instruction, initial issue of SPRAM is defined using
            the concept of new support. The following provide examples of the concept of
            new support.
                2.3.4.25.1.1.1. The requirement is supporting a new aircraft.
                2.3.4.25.1.1.2. New mission. The using organization is converting from one
                weapon system to another, or the unit’s mission changes, requiring a change
                in the SPRAM mix.
                2.3.4.25.1.1.3. New requirement. The TO has changed requiring a change in
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      65


               the amount of SPRAM.
           2.3.4.25.1.2. The PM will fund the SPRAM buy requirement using initial MSD
           CA based on the end item (e.g., aircraft support or electronics and
           telecommunications) that the SPRAM is supporting. To accomplish the free-of-
           charge issue, the PM will work with the wholesale item manager to acquire the
           necessary SPRAM assets and have them direct delivered to the using base. Once
           the assets are received at the using base, the base supply receiving function will
           not process a receipt for the asset, but will place the asset directly on the
           customer's SPRAM detail (K detail).
           2.3.4.25.1.3. Required initial SPRAM could be satisfied through on-hand supply
           balances, if the asset is in an excess position.
               2.3.4.25.1.3.1. If the assets are at bases other than the requesting base, the
               PM, working with the wholesale item manager, will process RDO for those
               assets. The receiving base supply will take the necessary action to place the
               asset on the customer's SPRAM detail. The PM will use O&M funds to
               support all RDO actions.
               2.3.4.25.1.3.2. If the assets are at the base requesting the SPRAM, the
               requesting base supply will issue the asset to the requesting activity, which
               will pay SP for the transaction. In turn, the PM will work with their FM
               offices to reimburse the base requesting the SPRAM using O&M funds.
        2.3.4.25.2. Replacement/Replenishment SPRAM Requirements. For SPRAM
        supporting flying hour programs all replacement/replenishment SPRAM requirements
        will    be    funded     by   Centralized    Asset     Management.     All    other
        replacement/replenishment SPRAM requirements will be paid for by the MAJCOM
        or using organization. Replenishment is any asset that does not meet the criteria in
        Para 2.3.4.25.1 MSD charges Exchange Price if a carcass is returned, otherwise the
        SP will be charged.
     2.3.4.26. Time Compliance Technical Orders.
        2.3.4.26.1. When in-stock CSAG-S assets require modification, the asset is issued
        using activity code “C” to the repair shop and the accompanying TCTO kit is free
        issued (one TCTO kit for each installed CSAG-S asset requiring modification).
        2.3.4.26.2. CSAG-S is not responsible for funding the installation of modification
        kits when completed as a separate maintenance action. The exception to this is when
        a modification kit is being installed during depot overhaul of a Management of Items
        Subject to Repair (MISTR) exchangeable asset. The reason for this exception is that
        the cost of installation cannot be separated from the cost of the MISTR overhaul.
        2.3.4.26.3. The CSAG-S will not finance the replacement of modification kit
        components, which are CSAG-S items that are lost or used for other purposes by a
        using organization. Replacement kits are financed by the modification account that
        originally procured the kit.
        2.3.4.26.4. For kits that are cannibalized, the activity responsible for cannibalization
        is responsible for replacing the assets in the kit. As an example, if the base has a kit
66                                                               AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


        and needs to withdraw an asset to support a MICAP requisition, that base must order
        the asset at its expense to satisfy the kit shortage. If a wholesale IM directs the
        shipment of a kit asset to support a MICAP, then the wholesale IM must replace the
        asset in the kit.
     2.3.4.27. Transient Aircraft Support.
        2.3.4.27.1. Transient Aircraft Support for USAF aircraft (to include ANG and
        AFRC). Transient support is financed by the transient base. Parts will be backordered
        or issued from the LRS/Materiel Management Activity at the transient base,
        regardless of cost and source of supply, and normal sales and credit policies apply.
        The exception to this procedure is en route maintenance units that are funded and
        operated by Air Mobility Command (AMC) for strategic airlift aircraft.
            2.3.4.27.1.1. Issuance and billings of reparable assets are managed the same as
            assigned aircraft maintenance. The transient base will support all transient aircraft
            using a Type Organization Code 3 organization cost center record (OCCR),
            preferably via a dedicated transient alert or “TA” OCCR. Naturally, the transient
            base has an opportunity to repair the asset if a repair shop is loaded on the repair
            cycle record. The repair shop returns serviceable assets at Exchange Price and
            unserviceable assets receive no credit.
                2.3.4.27.1.1.1. If there is no repair shop loaded on the repair cycle record for
                that reparable asset at the transient base, the asset is tagged Not Reparable
                This Station (NRTS) by maintenance. It is then shipped by supply directly to
                the depot maintenance facility for repair, or the Consolidated Repair Facility
                (CRF) for those units under the alternate maintenance concept.
                2.3.4.27.1.1.2. If the transient base has a repair shop, the unserviceable asset
                is transferred to that shop using the original document number of the asset that
                was issued. The original issue document number should be used through the
                entire repair cycle until returned. The repair shop has the option to either
                NRTS the asset or it can repair the item and return the serviceable asset to
                supply. The cost of SRU/bits and pieces used is recorded against the transient
                base repair activity. For assets ordered in support of the flying hour program,
                there is no charge or credit at the item level as reimbursement to WCF is made
                through the CPFH process, for non-fly assets item level prices and credit
                return policies apply.
                2.3.4.27.1.1.3. Aircraft deployed or temporarily transferred from another base
                for an exercise, deployed operations, or other reasons (such as runway repair
                at their homestation) are not considered transient and will not be issued parts
                using the above transient rules. Such deployed aircraft will be supported via
                establishment and use a dedicated Project Funds Management Record
                (PFMR) and Type Org Code 3 OCCR.
                  2.3.4.27.1.1.3.1. The one exception to the deployed aircraft rule is when
                  aircraft are deployed to or operating from another base with a PFMR and
                  OCCR linked to that same MDS and MAJCOM already loaded at the
                  operating site. If a PFMR and OCCR are already in place for the same
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      67


                 MDS and MAJCOM, there is no need to create a new PFMR & OCCR for
                 the deployed aircraft, though the local LRS/Materiel Management Activity
                 has the option of directing the customer to create and use a new OCCR
                 linked to the preexisting PFMR.
                 2.3.4.27.1.1.3.2. CAM-type PFMRs & OCCRs will be established for
                 “regular” customer Wings which are deployed to or receive transient
                 support at a given base three or more times in a calendar year. See para
                 2.3.4.27.1.1.3.1 above for guidance on MAJCOM/MDS business rules.
        2.3.4.27.2. Transient Aircraft Support for other Services (US Navy, Army, etc.) and
        Agencies (National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Department of
        Homeland Security, etc.). Transient aircraft support is financed by the transient base.
        If parts are issued from base supply at the transient base, normal sales and credit
        policies apply, except other services or agencies will always pay SP for assets issued.
            2.3.4.27.2.1. The home base is responsible for reparable support for its aircraft,
            which require repair at a transient location when both of the following conditions
            occur: (1) the spare part is not available at the transient location and 2) the
            Exchange Price for the reparable is greater than $20,000.
            2.3.4.27.2.2. The two options available to home bases are:
                2.3.4.27.2.2.1. Lateral support from the nearest location, enabled by the home
                base providing a funding document to the support location. This allows
                standard MICAP procedures to occur, or maintenance-to-maintenance
                channels.
                2.3.4.27.2.2.2. Using    maintenance-to-maintenance        procedures,    the
                serviceable and reparable part originates and returns to the home base. This
                allows for DIFM control and associated financial transactions to be processed
                at the home base.
     2.3.4.28. Initial Issue of DLRs in Support of the Flying Hour Program.
        2.3.4.28.1. Justification letters for the initial issue of DLRs are required to validate
        the requirement and ensure funding is available to cover the requirement.
        2.3.4.28.2. Requesting organizations will coordinate Justification Letters through the
        organization's commander, then route them to their MAJCOM’s CPFH office.
            2.3.4.28.2.1. For organizations whose CPFH funding is centrally managed under
            Centralized Asset Management (CAM), the MAJCOM CPFH office will forward
            the justification letters to the CAM office at WPAFB for approval/disapproval.
            2.3.4.28.2.2. As Funds Holders, the AMC Transportation Working Capital Fund,
            ANG, AFRC, and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) will
            approve/disapprove initial issue requests.
        2.3.4.28.3. The Fund Holders will notify the supported Command and/or base
        organization of approval/disapproval within 5 business days of receipt.
  2.3.5. Flying Hour Reimbursement.
 68                                                               AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


      2.3.5.1. The flying hour reimbursement concept allows CSAG-S and GSD to sell flying
      hour related consumable/reparable spares and management services to the customer
      based upon hours supported with those parts and services.
      2.3.5.2. Each flying hour customer manages their cost per flying hour (CPFH) funding
      centrally with a single focal point loading and executing funds with no funds being
      distributed to the operating units/bases. Funds are loaded centrally into the applicable
      Accounting and Finance IT system so that monthly consolidated billings can occur.
      2.3.5.3. An obligation will be established at the beginning of each month using projected
      hours flown by each weapon system multiplied by the current, approved Air Force Cost
      Analysis Improvement Group (AFCAIG) CPFH rates. At the end of the month, the WCF
      will bill each weapon system for actual hours flown multiplied by the approved AFCAIG
      CPFH rate.
      2.3.5.4. New Project Funds Management Records (PFMR) for each weapon system will
      be assigned as flying hour program only. No funds targets will be loaded nor will funds
      checks be performed for these OCCR/PFMR(s).
      2.3.5.5. Billing for the flying PFMRs will be by the actual flying hours flown and not by
      individual stock numbers. The revenue will be recorded into one billing SRAN per
      customer for CSAG-S and for GSD for by the associated element of expense
      identification code for the appropriated funds reimbursing each WCF activity.
   2.3.6. Support Equipment (SE) Funding.
      2.3.6.1. SE is procured with O&M (EEIC 3400) or central procurement (appropriation
      3010/3011/3020/3080) dollars depending on the unit cost.
          2.3.6.1.1. SE items with a unit/system cost less than $250K are funded with O&M
          dollars. AFMC provides the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) input for O&M
          requirements to AFMC/A4F.
          2.3.6.1.2. Those SE items with a unit/system cost of $250K and above or exempted
          items are funded with central procurement dollars. Exempted items are all vehicles,
          items in support of PEO programs, munitions and associated equipment, automatic
          test systems, and night vision goggles. Requirements for central procurement dollars
          for the items/programs that fall into this category are placed in the POM by the
          MAJCOM. These items are budgeted using Procurement Documents (PDOCs)
          submitted to Congress through SAF/AQX. PDOCs reflect the decisions of the POM
          submissions.

Section 2E—Degraded Operations

2.5. Degraded Operations.
   2.5.1. Governing materiel management support processes must be performed in the event the
   materiel management IT system (in whole or in part) is not available. A degraded operation
   condition exists when automated systems are inoperative or other circumstances significantly
   impede normal materiel management processing.
      2.5.1.1. Materiel management support operations are degraded when automated systems
      are not accessible; are temporarily down due to power failure, environmental condition,
      hardware/software problem, etc.; or during normal offline periods (end-of-day, end-of-
      year). 2.5.1.2. Manual accounting procedures must be used during degraded operations.

        2.5.2.6.8. Coordinate schedule of exercises with the MAJCOMs.
        2.5.2.6.9. Coordinate IT system outages.
  2.5.3. Degraded Operations Planning
     2.5.3.1. COOP. To the maximum extent feasible redundancies and failsafe capabilities
     will be included in materiel management systems to prevent outages. However, system
     outages will still occur. In anticipation of such outages, each materiel management
     activity will maintain a COOP that addresses situations when normal system processing
     is unavailable and manual accounting will be required. Not all situations addressed in the
     COOP will require manual accounting.
     2.5.3.2. Materiel Management Contingency Team. As part of a base’s materiel
     management contingency plan, a contingency management team will be established to
     maintain control of overall materiel management operations. The composition of the
     management team may vary, but normally it will include the LRS CC/AO or equivalent,
     the CTC, and representatives from each affected elements. The initial team meeting will
     focus on assessing the situation and reviewing the contingency plan. This team will
     conduct situation assessments, identify problems, and make recommendations for
     operation changes throughout the exercise/situation.
     2.5.3.3. System Transaction Recovery (STR). Occasionally problems will occur that
     cause database errors in Materiel Management IT systems. When this happens the system
     will be restored to the last back-up and thorough research must be conducted to determine
     what transactions must be replayed/reprocessed. Materiel management activities will be
     prepared to respond to these situations that require STR. These situations may drive the
     need for manual accounting during the database recovery.
     2.5.3.4. Support to Contingency Operations. Support to contingency operations may or
     may not involve manual accounting operations. Most contingency sites will have access
     to materiel management automated systems so normal transaction processing will apply.
     However, when systems are not available manual accounting procedures will apply.
  2.5.4. Manual Accounting.
     2.5.4.1. Materiel management activities will establish a CT capable of executing and
     managing degraded operations.
     2.5.4.2. Materiel management activities will maintain applicable data prepositioned for
     degraded operations.
     2.5.4.3. Materiel management activities (base retail and wholesale) will follow
     procedures in AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2E, Degraded Operations.
     2.5.4.4. Materiel management manual accounting operations are mandatory for UND A
     Issues and MICAP reportable transactions (e.g. backorders, shipments, receipts, DORs).
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     73


          2.5.4.4.1. Other transactions are assessed on a case by case basis with close
          coordination between materiel management activities as needed.
          2.5.4.4.2. After 72 hours, impacted materiel management activities will perform a
          daily assessment and adjust transaction processing as needed to support mission
          requirements (e.g. begin accepting and processing requests for RSP replenishment,
          single point failure, UND B, receipt, turn-in).
      2.5.4.5. Exercises directed by AF/A4LM, end-of-year closeout, and real world outages
      may be counted as a local degraded operations exercise.
      2.5.4.6. After a degraded operations exercise, LRS QA will submit an After Action
      Report through the LRS CC/AO to the MAJCOM A4R no later than 10 working days
      after completion of recovery. Note: Operating in a degraded/manual mode does not
      supersede the need to ensure special handling is enforced. Each functional area will
      ensure that special handling continues to be applied as warranted. Special emphasis will
      be placed on the control of classified and NWRM items.

  2.6.2. RSP Overview:
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       77


     2.6.2.1. Readiness Spares Packages. RSPs are used to support deployments of AF
     weapon systems. AF doctrine is to immediately establish premium transportation based
     air routes for eligible Class IX(a) and Class VII(x) assets from point of use to repair node
     and retrograde to point of use so as to achieve consistent resupply within 72 hours.
     Fundamental logistics warfighting doctrine and assumptions are found in the AF War and
     Mobilization Plan, Volume I. Over time, as force structure and operational planning
     change, authorizations for RSP change also.
     2.6.2.2. Authorization Document.
         2.6.2.2.1. Authorizations are based entirely on formal wartime tasking in the War and
         Mobilization Plan. That tasking is determined by agreement between AF/A5 (or
         equivalent for non-airborne authorizations) and the appropriate MAJCOM operational
         OPR. Authorizations for RSP resulting from those wartime taskings are listed in the
         RSP Authorization Document. Volume 3, Part III provides authorization for airborne
         RSP and Volume 2 provides authorization for non-airborne RSP. MAJCOMs are
         authorized RSP for allocation to specific units/bases. The only effective avenue for
         the update/correction of Volume 3, Part III of the authorization document is for the
         using MAJCOM operations community to advocate such an update/correction to the
         appropriate Air Staff OPR.
         2.6.2.2.2. For airborne systems, since the PM must build RSPs IAW the published
         authorization document. MAJCOMs, in conjunction with AFMC, develop the spares
         lists, which make up the RSP. The RSP will be adapted to fit the peculiar mission
         requirements of each individual organization to which it applies. Squadron specific
         contingency packages may be developed for all aircraft weapon systems other than
         strategic airlift aircraft. Either MRSP or In-Place Readiness Spares Package (IRSP)
         will be authorized against a single requirement, but not both. End items (including
         communications security items) with Expendability, Recoverability, Reparability and
         Category (ERRC) Code "S" or "U" will not be included in RSP.
         2.6.2.2.3. A separate unit-specific contingency package may be established for each
         unit authorized an MRSP or IRSP. AMC strategic airlift aircraft are exempted from
         unit specific contingency package development per policy waiver granted by
         AF/A4L. When required, MAJCOM will assign discrete identification numbers to
         contingency authorizations provided to field units.
         2.6.2.2.4. When an RSP authorization is permanently transferred from one command
         to another, the MRSP bins and assets will be transferred intact to the gaining
         command. Those items of RSP that are not transferred will be made available for
         redistribution. If an RSP authorization is deleted from AF requirements, the using
         command will inform the storing command materiel management activity.
         Disposition instructions will be requested through the MAJCOM to AFMC to
         determine appropriate disposition. The RSP Authorization Document will identify
         transfers and deletions wherever possible. Any omissions or conflicts with the
         document must be addressed from the using command's operations staff to the
         authorizing OPR at HAF, with information copies to AF/A4LM.
  2.6.3. Spare Parts program objective. The major objective of the RSP program is to support
  national strategy in consonance with the guidance issued by OSD. Specifically, the AF
 78                                                               AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


   objective is to authorize, acquire on time, preposition, pre-stock, and maintain in a
   serviceable condition ready for use, all RSP needed to support the wartime activities
   specified in the Defense Planning Guidance and the War and Mobilization Plan (WMP).
   2.6.4. Contingency support for AF and the Air Reserve Components (ARC) is provided
   through the utilization of on-hand Peacetime Operating Stock (POS) and RSPs. .
   Contingency support can come from RSP or POS through many supply chain processes, such
   as special levels, CHPMSKs, MSKs, and CRSPs to ensure that stocks are in place at the right
   time to support the contingency mission. The RSP is prepositioned at or near the base of
   intended use and/or airlifted to the employment bases prior to, concurrently with, or
   following the deploying forces.
   2.6.5. The only items authorized in airborne RSP are those listed on the Minimum Essential
   Subsystem List (MESL). These items support a specific weapon system and generate a Non-
   Mission Capable (NMC) grounding condition. Note: Safety-of-flight items are authorized
   even if not listed on the MESL and must be computed to the maximum extent possible.
   2.6.6. Funding for RSPs.
       2.6.6.1. Operating commands conduct RSP reviews annually in association with AFMC
       PM RSP Managers. To update the types and number of parts needed for right sizing is
       based on modifications, demand rate changes, Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF)
       changes and maintenance experience with past deployments. New requirements are
       computed by the AFMC logistics systems and validated by MAJCOM. Programming and
       budgeting for RSP and HPMSK annual adjustments is the responsibility of AFMC.
       AFMC will include these requirements in the AFWCF budget as part of the Materiel
       Support Division buy requirement. See Sec. 2C of this instruction for further information.
           2.6.6.1.1. New RSPs and authorization changes required for modification of current
           weapon systems or mission changes are funded through the 3010/3080 procurement
           accounts. New authorizations can be driven by new weapon systems entering AF
           inventory, modification of current weapon systems, or mission changes.
           2.6.6.1.2. Mission changes include changes in operational requirements (e.g.
           conventional vs. nuclear), changes in number of Primary Aircraft Assigned (PAA)
           supported, changes in the WMP-3, Part III, such as independent vs. dependent kits or
           in-place vs. mobility kits.
           2.6.6.1.3. New authorizations and mission changes will be carried in an “unfunded”
           status until verification of funding/asset source. The presence of an authorization in
           an “unfunded” status reflects the lead Commands’ commitment to advocate for the
           requirement in their POM for all users of the new kit requirement. The lead
           command’s A8 is responsible for the POM process.
2.6.6.1.4. Lead MAJCOM A4 is responsible for notifying the MAJCOM/A8 of new RSP
authorization requirements and justifying the new authorizations to the A8 for prioritization in
the MAJCOM POM request. The lead command is responsible for addressing the total force RSP
requirement. Responsibility for determination of the total force POM requirement is with the
lead command in conjunction with AFMC.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     79


         2.6.6.1.5. AFMC will determine the net buy and repair cost of new MRSP
         authorizations.
         2.6.6.1.6. The AFMC will pass the net cost to the lead command A4/A8, so
         programming actions can be undertaken during the POM.
         2.6.6.1.7. Once funding is approved through the POM/Budget Estimate Submission
         (BES)/PB, the lead MAJCOM/A4/A8 should notify AF/A5XW (through AF/A4/7) to
         have the authorization moved to the funded section.
  2.6.7. New Weapon Systems.
     2.6.7.1. The initial step in RSP development will be a preliminary meeting between the
     PM and MAJCOM, chaired by the PM or delegated alternate, to determine when and by
     what method the initial RSP provisioning quantities will be computed and passed to the
     PM RSP manager. Minutes of the meeting will be prepared to document the specific
     ground rules and method of operation. Copies of the minutes will be provided to AFMC,
     the MAJCOM RSP manager, AF/A4L, and all attendees.
     2.6.7.2. Selection of newly designed non-stocklisted items for inclusion in RSP must be
     a joint decision of the PM and the MAJCOM.
     2.6.7.3. The provisioning quantities will be computed to the greatest extent possible
     using the Aircraft Sustainability Model (ASM).
     2.6.7.4. Close coordination in this process is required by AFMC and the MAJCOM
     OPRs.
  2.6.8. Accountability
     2.6.8.1. Equipment items, including support equipment, will not be included in
     applicable non-airborne RSPs. Spare parts to repair support equipment may be included
     in the RSP.
     2.6.8.2. All investment items, regardless of authorization source, will be carried on
     FB/FE detail records.
     2.6.8.3. Allowance Standard items (equipment items -- ERRC code "S" and "U") will be
     accounted for on Equipment Authorized Inventory Data (EAID) details. Spares to support
     equipment packages such as BEAR and FORCE, etc. must be accounted for on a RSP
     detail records. The only kinds of RSPs that are WRM are BEAR and FMSE/FORCE.
     These types of RSP must be managed IAW RSP policy and AFI 25-101.
     2.6.8.4. RSPs are prepositioned as follows:
         2.6.8.4.1. The using command will be responsible for arranging logistics support for
         its activities at non-AF locations in the continental United States. Arrangements with
         ANG units will be negotiated through the National Guard Bureau. This will be
         coordinated with storing/reporting commands (as appropriate), AFMC, and any other
         AF command, military service or governmental agency concerned. When the
         designated storing/reporting command has an RSP prepositioning requirement at a
         non-AF location and does not have the capability to support that requirement, the
         using command and AF/A4LM will be advised. The using command will evaluate the
         requirement for prepositioning the RSP and, if valid, will negotiate an alternate
80                                                                AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


         method of support. If a solution to the problem cannot be found, the issue will be
         elevated to AF/A4LM for final resolution.
         2.6.8.4.2. When RSPs cannot be prepositioned at AF locations, the storing command
         will select alternate storage locations in coordination with the using command,
         AFMC, and any other affected commands.
     2.6.8.5. The peacetime deployment of an MRSP or MRSP segment will be transferred to
     the host account if the deployment is for greater than 30 days. RSP will not be transferred
     if the deployment is for less than 30 days. The using command or subordinate
     headquarters will coordinate all support requirements in advance with the command
     providing computer support for the deployment (and the command providing home
     station support, if different than the using command). Temporary package transfers
     involving packages assigned to ARC units will also be coordinated with AFRC or ANG,
     as appropriate. In addition, the using command or subordinate headquarters will publish
     detailed guidance in appropriate deployment planning and implementation documents to
     ensure adequate controls over the deployed assets.
         2.6.8.5.1. For deployments (less than 30 days), details will contain deployment
         indicators, and accountability for the items will remain at the home station. Establish
         deployment indicators as follows:
            2.6.8.5.1.1. For Continental United States (CONUS) deployment indicators will
            be established no earlier than nine (9) days prior to deployment.
            2.6.8.5.1.2. For Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) deployment
            indicators will be established no earlier than 14 days prior to deployment.
         2.6.8.5.2. For temporary transfer, the designated CSB will assume RSP
         accountability. However, the owning base still retains MRSP SORTS reporting
         responsibility unless SORTS reporting is done by a centralized agency.
         2.6.8.5.3. Deploying units will submit requests to transfer supply kits and packages
         to their owning AFMC SCM-R Contingency Operations Activity. The owning AFMC
         SCM-R Contingency Operations Activity will provide detailed kit transfer and
         specific redeployment instructions, to include a request for the latest results of the
         PC-Aircraft Sustainment Model assessment. The losing AFMC SCM-R Contingency
         Operations Activity will coordinate with the gaining AFMC SCM-R Contingency
         Operations Activity (servicing the deployment theater) as required.
     2.6.8.6. The deployed unit CC assigns supervisory responsibility to a deployed unit
     member when no forward supply account exists. Accompanying personnel may be co-
     located with the aviation package under control of the deployed unit CC.
     2.6.8.7. Use and peacetime replenishment of MRSP assets while deployed will be as
     specified in MAJCOM to MAJCOM operations orders and agreements.
     2.6.8.8. Items consumed while the MRSP is on temporary loan will be replaced by the
     using organization, insofar as possible, prior to return of the package. If time does not
     permit, it will be returned to the organization with the existing shortages, and action taken
     to replace items.
  2.6.9. Review Process.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      81


     2.6.9.1. Review Schedule and Milestones.
         2.6.9.1.1. The PM and affected MAJCOMs will review RSP annually. The review
         cycle will be timed to conclude in time for Air Staff approval of the requirement prior
         to the March IT system cycle RSP overlay. The purpose of the review is to update the
         range of items in authorized RSPs and verify the complete set of data used to
         compute quantities for those items. The review will include all recoverable items.
         Stock class 1377 cartridge actuated devices and propellant actuated devices are
         exempt from annual review. Selected EOQ items, to include the following categories,
         must also be reviewed: aircraft guns, gun components, aircraft wheels, aircraft tires,
         aircraft brakes and brake components, and others, as agreed between the PM and
         affected MAJCOMs. Reviews may be formal (face-to-face and unit funded) or
         informal (by correspondence). A formal review will be held for all new weapon
         systems or end items and for all weapon systems or end items undergoing significant
         changes in configuration or demand rates. The decision to hold a formal or informal
         review will be made jointly by the PM and affected MAJCOMs. When a weapon
         system or end item has been reviewed informally for three consecutive years, a
         formal review will be held. The scheduling of a review is done jointly by the PM and
         the using commands; the PMs decision is final. Once the review is scheduled, all
         using commands must provide their required inputs IAW the milestones.
         2.6.9.1.2. For major milestones and additional details for the airborne review process
         refer to AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 2.
  2.6.10. Asset Reporting. Levels and assets will be reported in the Air Force Recoverable
  Assembly Management System (AFRAMS) or equivalent system using document identifier
  “9QN” format contained in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2. Storage:
  2.6.11. Storage Management.
     2.6.11.1. Maintain all RSP and peacetime assets in serviceable condition. MAJCOMS
     requiring RSPs to be stored at non-AF locations will be responsible for its maintenance.
     RSPs are considered supplies of vital importance and must be stored in facilities that
     meet the fire protection standards identified in the DoD Military Handbook 1008C, Fire
     Protection for Facilities Engineering, Design and Construction.
     2.6.11.2. Tenant organizations required to maintain a deployment capability will keep
     the required manpower authorizations to support the mobility requirement. Host/tenant
     support agreements will be established to specify who will store and maintain the RSP.
     2.6.11.3. Assets authorized for IRSP may be commingled with POS. Assets in MRSP
     may not be commingled with POS, they should be segregated and clearly marked within
     the warehouse location.
     2.6.11.4. MRSP will be stored in mobility bins or in segregated base warehouse
     locations. Items too large for mobility bins may be stored on 463L pallets for immediate
     movement.
     2.6.11.5. The maintaining activity must ensure that proper shelf life control, rotation, TO
     compliance, and inventory practices are followed.
82                                                                 AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


        2.6.11.5.1. Care of Supplies in Storage (COSIS), shelf life controls and other
        inspection functions established for like peacetime assets will be applied to RSP
        items. All expendables owned by the materiel management activity will be rotated
        with similar peacetime items to protect their continued serviceability.
        2.6.11.5.2. TO and Functional Check. Complete TO compliance actions for RSP
        assets in the same manner as peacetime stocks and IAW applicable TOs. Functional
        check requirements, as identified in Sec. 5G, Physical Inventory and Inventory
        Adjustments, will be performed prior to the item being placed in RSP. The frequency
        of subsequent inspections or checks will be as specified in the governing TO.
        2.6.11.5.3. Inventory. All configurations of RSP and MSK’s will be inventoried
        within 10 calendar days after return from deployment or transfer. All classified assets
        will be inventoried and stored IAW AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5C & Sec. 5G of this
        instruction. All other assets will be inventoried annually. The materiel management
        activity will seal MRSP bins at the time of deployment. In addition, the gaining
        materiel management activity will inventory an MRSP when it is received on a
        transfer or loan from another unit.
  2.6.12. RSP Packages:
     2.6.12.1. Packages are developed to support the force as it is planned to exist at several
     specific points in time.
        2.6.12.1.1. Contingency packages are built to support the force as it will exist at the
        end of the current review cycle; therefore the review contingency package will be
        built to match authorizations for the next fiscal year.
        2.6.12.1.2. A buy package is to be input to the next budget cycle after the current
        review cycle is completed. The review buy package will be built to match
        authorizations three fiscal years into the future.
     2.6.12.2. Independent/Dependent Concept.
        2.6.12.2.1. The independent/dependent squadron is a mobility concept designed to
        recognize wartime deployment and beddown plans for aircraft units. If two aircraft
        squadrons having the same MDS are programmed to deploy and operate from a single
        wartime beddown location, an attempt will be made to draw those squadrons from a
        single wing and tailor unit equipment and manning to recognize the efficiencies
        inherent to multiple squadron beddown.
     2.6.12.3. Regardless of how the authorized MRSP is warehoused or packaged for
     deployment, it will be reported as a single MRSP of the Primary Mission Aircraft
     Inventory (PMAI). The dependent MRSP must be combined with the independent MRSP
     and will be SORTS reported as a single MRSP of the combined PMAI.
     2.6.12.4. When units operate under the independent/dependent concept, a "working
     package" of the combined PMAI must be built. This package will not be listed in the RSP
     Authorization Document, and must always have an authorization factor of zero, because
     no such unit actually exists. It is built solely to aid in determining the quantities for NSNs
     in the dependent package. The working package and dependent MRSP will be built after
     all file maintenance has been done on the independent package. For procedures detailing
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                    83


     the creation of the working package and associated computations, refer to AFMAN 23-
     122, Sec. 2F, Readiness Spares Packages and Kits.
  2.6.13. Airborne MRSP:
     2.6.13.1. In-Place Readiness Spares Package. IRSP includes only the parts needed over
     and above the normal POS levels expected to be available to a unit during wartime. IRSP
     use POS for wartime requirements. The AF offsets the Total Wartime Requirement
     (TWR) by subtracting the amount of POS it expects to be serviceable on-hand, which
     becomes the additive IRSP Authorized Quantity.
     2.6.13.2. The CRSP concept allows MAJCOMs to use either Mobility Readiness Spares
     Package (MRSP) or IRSP details to manage consumable item support for contingency
     deployments. The CRSP process provides requirement and asset visibility, has automated
     transfer and deployment procedures, the capability to provide the correct priority and
     project-coded replenishment requisitions.
        2.6.13.2.1. AF units will maintain all approved CRSP authorizations in the retail
        systems and in a constant state of readiness to deploy in support of contingency
        operations. When reconciliation/approved authorization files are received from
        MAJCOM they will be loaded and requisitioned immediately. The CRSP levels for
        AF units will be based upon 2 years of demand history data, retrieved using the 7SC
        data for ERRC XB3/XF3. Where possible and applicable, MAJCOMs should use
        demand history from multiple bases using the same mission design series (MDS)
        weapon system. MAJCOMs will use 7SC data to create a list of consumables
        candidates. MAJCOMs will compute all EOQ requirements and for those items
        required for the LRU (attaching hardware) apply the higher of the computed quantity
        versus the QPA required quantity. MAJCOM's will conduct an annual base level
        review to determine the range of items to be included in the CRSP. Units will provide
        an AF Form 1032, WRM Spares List with valid justification for out-of-cycle changes
        or items that are not on the 7SC list of candidates.
     2.6.13.3. Non-Airborne MRSP:
        2.6.13.3.1. Non-airborne requirements are determined by the MAJCOM. The
        concurrence of the IMS/Equipment Specialist (ES) will be obtained for AF-managed
        assets. The RSP will include spares necessary to support all end items in the
        deploying non-airborne Unit Type Code (UTC). Equipment items, including support
        equipment, may not be included in RSPs. Spare parts, to repair support equipment,
        may be included in RSP.
     2.6.13.4. End Item Serial Number /Purpose Serial Number (ESN/PSN) Structure.
        2.6.13.4.1. A standard thirteen-digit serial number structure will be used to identify
        all RSPs. The PM RSP managers (or subsystem program manager for end items not
        managed under a PM office) will assign serial numbers in appropriate IT systems.
        2.6.13.4.2. Non-airborne reparable authorizations are shown for the “Purpose” or
        “Mission” they are designed to perform, such as a CRE (Control Reporting Element),
        or an individual combat communication system (such as GRC-239, Troop-Satellite
        Support Radio). “Purpose packages” composed of end item packages for individual
84                                                              AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


        components are built in D087H and their supported relationships are established in
        the ESN/PSN Relationship Table.
     2.6.13.5. PM RSP managers will perform file maintenance of the relationship table.
     MAJCOMs will provide updates to PM RSP managers as required.
     2.6.13.6. Mission Support Kit (MSK).
        2.6.13.6.1. A MSK is a transportable package of expendable supplies and spares,
        parts for aircraft, engines, aerospace ground equipment, and communications end
        items. These items are required to support an AF unit or segment of a unit when
        deployed for short durations. If deployed for less than 30 days and support (the levels
        and replenishment requisitions) is from the home base or no replenishment is
        necessary, then a MSK can be used. Deployed MSKs cannot be replenished from the
        deployment location, nor is replenishment for spares pulled from home station to fill
        MSKs authorized. Special priority or Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) project codes are not
        authorized for home station requisitions generated because assets were pulled for an
        MSK (e.g. if a part is canned to fill a kit and a MICAP is generated to fill the hole).
        MSKs detail records are usually kept on home station record with a deployed
        indicator.
     2.6.13.7. High Priority Mission Support Kit:
        2.6.13.7.1. A HPMSK is an additive air-transportable package of expendable
        supplies and repair cycle assets designed to support a weapon system at a deployed
        location. An HPMSK supports selected units by providing a spares package which
        contain assets that are additive to the base demand level and to worldwide
        requirement in D200A. The HPMSK is built to support units with unique peacetime
        operational flying profiles that cannot support with unit Readiness Based Levels
        (POS). HPMSKs are funded by the owning MAJCOM.
        2.6.13.7.2. AF/A4L is the approval authority for all HPMSKs. MAJCOMs will
        forward HPMSK requests directly to AF/A4L. Only in unique situations, and with the
        approval of AF/A4L, will units with authorized MRSP be authorized an HPMSK.
        Once approved, HPMSK authorization will be documented in War and Mobilization
        Plan (WMP) 3, Part III, “RSP Authorization Document.” All approved HPMSKs will
        be loaded into the appropriate IT system. The ASM will compute HPMSKs using the
        Direct Support Objective (DSO) and flying profiles provided in the WMP or OPLAN.
        RSP Non-optimized rules will also apply to HPMSK computations. Any exceptions
        to computation policy and parameters will be approved by AF/A4L.
     2.6.13.8. Temporary High Priority Mission Support Kit (THPMSK)
        2.6.13.8.1. A THPMSK is an MSK built to support short term deployments
        (generally more than 30 days and less than 90 days) and the level/details records are
        transferred to the gaining host base. Requisitioning action comes from the
        contingency site to the source of supply. The “transferred to” base increases its
        Requisitioning Objective (RO) for the THPMSK and the home base RO is reduced by
        the amount of the THPMSK levels. When THPMSK is an option, MSKs should not
        be used. The THPMSK is similar to the CHPMSK, except it is used to support
        contingency operations for a period less than 90 days or to support quick reaction
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      85


          contingencies (when there is no time to get a CHPMSK approved or when it is
          unknown if the contingency will last more than 90 days). Also THPMSK levels come
          only from the deploying unit, the home station RO is reduced for all NSNs loaded in
          the THPMSK. THPMSKs can become CHPMSKs if the contingency is extended
          beyond 90 days.
          2.6.13.8.2. The Host LRS CC/AO can approve deployed MSK. If the THPMSK
          option is available to MAJCOMs, MSKs will not be transferred (deployed only).
          Exceptions must be granted by AF/A4L. (T-2).
      2.6.13.9. Contingency High Priority Mission Support Kit:
          2.6.13.9.1. CHPMSK and deployed MSK are separate and distinct from HPMSKs.
          When a deployment or tasking can be accomplished within existing flying hour
          programs (i.e. aircraft are flying peacetime hours at a site away from home station),
          the CHPMSK or deployed MSK are the options to use. A CHPMSK should be used
          when transferring the assets to a contingency and support (replenishment and
          requisitioning) will come from the contingency base. These packages provide support
          to tasked units without increasing the worldwide requirement and are not additive
          requirements. Therefore, additional funding is not required.
              2.6.13.9.1.1. CHPMSK levels are provided from the overall worldwide POS
              requirements not just from the home station of the deploying aircraft. RBL levels
              are allocated in a way that minimizes worldwide expected backorders. Refer to
              AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 2F, Readiness Spares Packages (RSP) and Kits for
              approval procedures and transaction processing to establish CHPMSK.
              2.6.13.9.1.2. CHPMSK may also support CRF until demands are sufficient to
              establish peacetime levels.
              2.6.13.9.1.3. AF units supporting split operations (deploying a unit to more than
              one location) or rainbow unit deployments (aircraft from different units deploying
              to one location) to support recurring or AEF deployments may use CHPMSKs.
              Using CHPMSKs for this purpose reduces redundant airlift requirements,
              alleviates support problems associated with the lack of depth in RSPs for split
              operation deployments, and minimizes home station support degradation for lead
              unit rainbow deployments.
              2.6.13.9.1.4. CHPMSKs are authorized for tactical JCS coded units supported by
              IRSP offset levels.

Section 2G—Contingency/Wartime Planning

2.7. Contingency/Wartime Planning.
   2.7.1. General Considerations. Planning shall be done IAW AFI 10-401 and AFI 10-403.
   This section provides the basis for developing and providing materiel management inputs for
   this planning.
   2.7.2. Responsibilities.
      2.7.2.1. AF/A4LM.
86                                                              AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


         2.7.2.1.1. (DELETED)
         2.7.2.1.2. (DELETED)
         2.7.2.1.3. AF/A4LM is responsible for making materiel management inputs to
         Volumes 1 and 3 of the War and Mobilization Plan (WMP) annually.
         2.7.2.1.4. Submit Unit Type Codes (UTCs) to the AF/A4LM functional manager,
         AF/A5X, and MAJCOM Manpower & Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK)
         OPR. (T-2).
         2.7.2.1.5. AF/A4LX planners shall oversee the UTC development process.
     2.7.2.2. MAJCOMS will:
         2.7.2.2.1. AFMC will assist with Materiel Management planning.
         2.7.2.2.2. Develop contingency plans for bases/forces under their command and
         ensure OPLANs are supportable and Limiting Factors (LIMFACs) /shortfalls are
         identified and resolved.
         2.7.2.2.3. Coordinate and provide guidance with Air Staff, other Service Staffs,
         MAJCOM counterparts and base-level planners.
         2.7.2.2.4. Develop appropriate inputs to the Logistics Annex and materiel
         management portions to OPLANs. Review other portions of OPLANs to evaluate
         materiel management requirements.
         2.7.2.2.5. Determine personnel and materiel requirements for inclusion in the Time
         Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD).
         2.7.2.2.6. Assess organic capability (personnel/materiel) and either task this
         capability to support the owning command's requirements or offer it to other
         commands through the WMP, Part 3 (WMP-3).
     2.7.2.3. Base level units that are pilot units will:
         2.7.2.3.1. Work with their respective MAJCOM on creating, updating and/or deleting
         an UTC. MAJCOM MEFPAK manager will coordinate with other MAJCOM
         counterparts prior to approving, changing, and/or deleting UTC. Non-pilot units will
         request changes through their applicable MAJCOM and not directly back to the Pilot
         Unit.
         2.7.2.3.2. Submit UTCs to the MAJCOM MEFPAK OPR for approval, cancellation
         or change.
  2.7.3. The AF materiel management IT system must support wartime combat operations
  from any location, whether it is a bare base, a collocated operating base, and/or an existing
  theater main operating base (MOB) in OCONUS or any other contingency area identified in
  published operational plans. It must also support the worldwide deployment commitment of
  tactical and strategic forces as specified in the AF 10-series instructions. During
  contingencies, maximum materiel management IT system processing support must be
  provided for direct mission requirements. For degraded operations refer to Sec. 2E of this
  instruction.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   87


  2.7.4. Wartime support for AF forces is provided through the use of peacetime assets plus
  WRM. On-hand base primary operating stocks will be used to support WRM requirements
  when sufficient WRM assets are not available to support implementation of an approved AF
  war plan. The WRM is prepositioned at or near the base of intended use or is transported to
  the employed bases before, concurrently with, or following the deploying forces. During
  contingencies, all WRM assets will be integrated with and used as operating stocks.
  2.7.5. The LRS CC/AO must ensure prompt and accurate reporting of wartime stocks IAW
  AFI 10-201 Chapter 4 to facilitate stockpile readiness decisions.
  2.7.6. Mobility equipment required to meet wartime taskings will be identified by the
  MAJCOM and incorporated in either the Weapon System Allowance Standard (WSAS) or a
  general allowance standard (AS). All mobility equipment authorizations are mandatory and
  will either be on-hand, on-order, or contained in appropriate budget documents (unless
  centrally procured). Air Reserve Component (ARC) units tasked to fulfill the same UTC
  deployment requirements will be similarly equipped so they can be used interchangeably.
  These requirements are identified by gaining MAJCOMs and incorporated in the WSAS.
  2.7.7. The Concept of Operations (CONOPS), developed by AF/A4LX, outlines materiel
  management operations to support sustained combat operations across the entire spectrum of
  hostilities.
  2.7.8. The base-level materiel management planner will:
     2.7.8.1. Coordinate with MAJCOM counterparts and the Plans and Integration Section
     (LRS/LGRDX).
     2.7.8.2. Comply with OPLAN support requirements IAW AFI 10-401.
     2.7.8.3. Comply with BSP requirements IAW 10-404, Base Support And Expeditionary
     (BAS&E) Site Planning.
     2.7.8.4. Ensure materiel management inputs are provided IAW AFI 10-206, Operational
     Reporting.
     2.7.8.5. Monitor Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement and SORTS IAW
     AFI 10-201.
     2.7.8.6. Identify training requirements for assigned UTCs and ensure LRS/CC or
     equivalent cognizance for necessary action.
     2.7.8.7. Identify and prioritize all LIMFACs/shortfalls to LRS/LGRDX.
  2.7.9. The base materiel management planner will prepare for the actions required of
  deployed materiel management units deployed and absorbed as component forces in the
  theater.
     2.7.9.1. Home station pre-deployment actions will be IAW AFI 10-403 for the
     movement of equipment custodians and WRM (RSP, equipment, facilities, and WCDO)
     and the preparation of the deployment location (bare base or collocated operating base).
     2.7.9.2. After full-up communication connectivity, the materiel management UTC will
     establish accountability of deployed RSP and equipment using the materiel management
88                                                               AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


     IT system tied to the host computer for the deployed location. In-line processing by the
     host computer starts and normal base materiel management operations begin.
     2.7.9.3. Bulk shipments of CBRNE IPE and weapons will be received and stored by the
     deployed LRS/ Materiel Management Activity until issued.
     2.7.9.4. Planning For Redeployment/Reconstitution. This involves redeployment of
     forces within the AOR to forward operating locations (FOLs) or to home station. The
     materiel management planner will be aware of the following.
         2.7.9.4.1. FOL support will come from the main deployed base. FOLs will be
         considered off-base organizations of the main base. Support and accountability of
         assets will be provided and maintained by the main base.
         2.7.9.4.2. Redeployment will be accomplished by deployed teams who handle WRM.
         Property will be shipped in UTC configuration with shortages identified and
         inventory lists attached to designated locations for reconstitution. Reconstitution will
         be accomplished at specified sites by deployed reconstitution teams. After
         reconstitution, assets will be forwarded to prepositioning sites.
         2.7.9.4.3. Deployed functional agencies/custodians are responsible for inventorying
         and processing the accountability of assets through materiel management. Materiel
         management will then transfer accountability back to the original unit/prepositioning
         site, and direct property flow of RSPs and equipment.
  2.7.10. Planning guidelines for materiel management support at deployed locations.
     2.7.10.1. The following general guidelines will be used by the base materiel management
     planner for operating at the deployed location.
     2.7.10.2. The LRS CC/AO will ensure maximum survivability of WRM assets and
     critical peacetime operating stocks, preferably by storing in hardened shelters. In
     wartime, critical assets must be dispersed and not stored in a single location. Potential
     sortie delays caused by dispersal can be tolerated as opposed to total loss of critical
     spares. The planner will ensure planning is based upon anticipated wartime vulnerability
     rather than peacetime efficiency.
     2.7.10.3. The base materiel management planner will designate alternate demand
     processing and LRS readiness locations. COOP planning is essential for materiel
     management operations.
     2.7.10.4. A large workload is generated by break-out and issue of WRM, especially
     auxiliary fuel tanks. Planners will ensure break-out/movement of WRM is practiced and
     publish adequate procedural guidance. WRM break-out and movement may be the largest
     materiel management workload early in a contingency.
     2.7.10.5. Materiel management planners will identify all buildings projected for materiel
     management use and, if none exist, plan for storage/work area alternatives. Storage space
     requirements depend upon the aviation packages being supported. Special care will be
     given to wartime use of WRM facilities for conversion to general materiel management
     storage. MAJCOM planners will pre-identify these buildings and binning/warehouse
     items required to convert from WRM to standard materiel management warehouses.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   89


  2.7.11. Logistics Support Decisions.
     2.7.11.1. Materiel management planning requires a review of logistics support decisions
     prior to deployments to ensure selected procedures are consistent with the planned
     logistics support concept. As a minimum, these decision elements are:
     2.7.11.2. Length of deployment (if known).
     2.7.11.3. Identification of owning and supporting materiel management IT system
     accounts. Unless deployed asset accountability transfers at time of deployment, the home
     base materiel management IT system will be the owning account. Otherwise, the gaining
     materiel management IT system must be identified as the owning materiel management
     IT system. Provide designated lateral materiel management IT system support bases
     including communication routing identifiers, DoDAAC and system designators.
     2.7.11.4. Spares Replenishment. Specify when and if replenishment is authorized.
     2.7.11.5. Specify if special vehicle and/or general purpose vehicle requirements will be
     identified and sourced.
     2.7.11.6. Requirement for base service store support and scope of operations. This
     requirement must address whether stocks are planned for initial lay-in and means for
     replenishment considering length of deployment.
     2.7.11.7. The force activity designator (FAD) of unit(s) to be supported.
     2.7.11.8. The planned maintenance concept, i.e. remove and replace or remove, repair,
     and replace or if a transition from former to the latter is planned.
     2.7.11.9. The movement of retrograde (reparables) must not be delayed. Deployed units
     must be aware of where to send reparables.
     2.7.11.10. The frequency/method for sending materiel management transactions must be
     determined.
     2.7.11.11. Contracting support and associated funding. Identification shall be made of
     needed contracting support and the establishment of imprest funds to provide for local
     purchase materiel management capability.
  2.7.12. Other Planning Tasks.
     2.7.12.1. Depending upon geographic location, MAJCOM, and mission, the LRS/CC
     may be responsible for planning actions other than reception. Some of these may include:
     2.7.12.2. Planning for Contingency Operating Bases (COB) or Bare Bases. Main
     operating bases are usually tasked to accomplish base-level deployment/reception
     planning for COBs and bare bases. The base logistics plans office/wing plans office can
     identify COB/bare base support responsibilities.
     2.7.12.3. Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) or Noncombatant Emergency &
     Evacuation Plan (NEMVAC). In areas of hostility and natural disaster, the US military
     may be tasked to assist the Department of State to evacuate, shelter, and provide for

     2.7.12.4. Host Nation Support Agreements (HNSA). At overseas locations, LRS
     planners will be aware of HNSAs. The host nation may agree through negotiations with
     the Department of State, Service components, and MAJCOMs to provide
     materiel/services to the US Government for use during a war or contingency. Knowledge
     of HNSAs significantly enhances planning efforts. However, the planner will have a
     back-up plan in the event host support does not materialize.
  2.7.13. Materiel management Wartime CONOPS
     2.7.13.1. CONOPS development will be done in IAW AFI 10-401.                   CONOPS
     assumptions include:
        2.7.13.1.1. Materiel management operations will be based upon a combination of
        self-sufficiency and responsive resupply management. Forward stockage, in-
        theater/regional repair capability, and theater-wide asset management will be
        employed, when appropriate, to support materiel management operations. Materiel
        management support systems will be deployed as soon as possible prior to or after the
        onset of hostilities or contingency and IAW current Operations Plan (OPLAN)
        taskings.
        2.7.13.1.2. Deployable communications to support stand-alone materiel management
        operations with an eventual communications link for upgrade to on-line operations, in
        conjunction with resupply management, are critical to combat capability.
        Communications and resupply management, therefore, must be established as early as
        possible. Since communication availability is never assured in wartime, data will be
        accumulated and transmitted by whatever means are available.
        2.7.13.1.3. Logistics support may be limited during the initial deployment period.
        Not all essential materiel can be initially deployed. Therefore, critical spares
        identified after arrival in the area of hostilities/contingency must be supported
        through expedited resupply management.
        2.7.13.1.4. Materiel management processing by deployed locations will be phased in
        by site as hardware and communications become available. The centralized capability
        provided by AFMC SCM-R Weapon System Support Activity is particularly
        appropriate for supporting combat operations from bare bases or locations that are too
        far from an established materiel management IT system.
  2.7.14. Contingency materiel management support requirements.
     2.7.14.1. The materiel management system must be structured to provide uninterrupted
     support for both in-place and deploying forces. How materiel management support
     processing is facilitated is largely driven by the scenario. Coordinate with AFMC SCM-R
     Contingency Operations Activity to ensure uninterrupted materiel management support.
     2.7.14.2. Day-to-day operations must mirror contingency operations to the greatest
     extent possible to minimize disruption and training disconnects.
     2.7.14.3. Base self-sufficiency and resupply management responsiveness must be
     maximized.
     2.7.14.4. In-place and deployed materiel management activities will maintain an audit
     trail on all transactions.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      91


       2.7.14.5. Theater resource allocation decisions must be made within the theater
       command structure.
       2.7.14.6. Support must include the entire spectrum of combat materiel including aircraft
       spares, equipment, vehicles, communications, civil engineering items, CWDE, uniform
       items, and base reconstitution supplies.
       2.7.14.7. Prepositioning WRM, surging depots, and resupply management efforts must
       be based on coordinated actions between AFMC, the lead command and operating
       commands.
       2.7.14.8. Range and depth of support will depend upon the nature/anticipated length of
       the contingency and total units to be supported, i.e. deployed units as well as those
       already in place (support infrastructure).
       2.7.14.9. Coordination with AFMC must be standardized as much as possible to
       accommodate any MAJCOM or contingency.
       2.7.14.10. Contingency materiel management concept.
          2.7.14.10.1. In-place units will operate with materiel available at the onset of
          hostilities and critical parts secured by whatever means is available after the
          contingency operation begins.
          2.7.14.10.2. Employment of mobile units will be comprised of two phases. The first
          phase involves deployment of a materiel management advance echelon (ADVON)
          Team (LRS/CC and materiel management infrastructure) to include capability of
          processing materiel management IT system transactions in a degraded operations
          mode. The second phase involves arrival of materiel management augmentation
          teams and connectivity with AFMC.
          2.7.14.10.3. From the beginning of a contingency until normal materiel management
          operations are resumed, materiel management support will consist of POS, RSPs,
          follow-on RSPs and responsive "Express Delivery Service" of high priority items.

Section 2H—Life Cycle Product Support Planning

2.8. Life Cycle Product Support Planning.
   2.8.1. The Product Support Manager (PSM) is responsible for developing a program's
   product support execution plan and documenting it in the Life Cycle Sustainment Plan
   (LCSP). The LCSP specifically addresses materiel management support. It delineates the
   PSM's plan for identifying, resourcing and implementing actions to acquire and repair spares,
   and all classes of supply to ensure the best equipment/capability is available to support the
   user. For additional detail, reference AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle
   Management and AFPAM 63-128, Guide to Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle
   Management and the Product Support Manager Guidebook.

Section 2J—Weapon System Support Program (WSSP)

2.10. Air Force Participation. Air Force Participation in the Defense Logistics Agency (DLAI
3223). Weapon System Support Program (WSSP).
   2.10.1. AF participation in this DLA managed program is required by DODM 4140.01-V2
   (February 10, 2014) and is essential to receiving the required level of DLA support for AF
   weapon systems. WSSP provides Services the capability to identify DLA managed NSNs
   required to support specific weapon systems. AF weapon systems using DLA managed
   NSNs are identified in the program by a weapon system designator code (WSDC). DLA
   managed NSNs are loaded in WSSP against the specific weapon system designator code
   (WSDC) on which the NSNs are used and each NSN is assigned an essentiality code (EC).
   EC's indicate the degree to which failure (shortage/stock-out) of a WSSP item affects the
   ability of a weapon system to perform its intended operation.
   2.10.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
       2.10.2.1. HAF A8X will:
          2.10.2.1.1. Determine criticality/priority (Level A to C) to the AF mission for each

          2.10.2.2.1. Provide department level oversight for management of AF participation in
          WSSP.
          2.10.2.2.2. Initiate annual prioritization review of WSGCs for systems registered in
          WSSP by requesting a current listing of systems with assigned WSGC from AFMC
          WSSP functional OPR
          2.10.2.2.3. Forward prioritized WSSP WSGC list to DLA.
       2.10.2.3. AFMC will: (T-1).
          2.10.2.3.1. Implement the AF component of WSSP.
          2.10.2.3.2. AFMC ESs will be primary focal points for determining and reviewing
          essentiality codes for NSNs maintained in WSSP for their respective weapon systems.
          This applies to ES personnel assigned to PM/system sustainment activities and supply
          chain management organizations. Commodity ES personnel will take the lead
          assisting AF WSSP Workbench Focal Points in reviewing and assigning ECs as
          required when systems they manage are considered “common” and used on multiple
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   93


        weapon systems. Commodity ES supervisors are authorized to grant access to the
        AF WSSP Workbench as focal points for weapon systems they support. (T-2).
        2.10.2.3.3. Develop and distribute procedures regarding AF use of WSSP.
        2.10.2.3.4. Serve as Functional OPR for the web based AF WSSP Workbench Tool.

        matters and assist weapon system focal points as required within each complex.
        2.10.2.3.7. Ensure all DLA managed NSNs which support AF WSDCs are correctly
        registered (e.g. valid ECs and all other required data) in DLA WSSP and any change
        data is continually incorporated.
        2.10.2.3.8. Establish an AF WSSP Integrated Process Team (IPT), chaired by AFMC
        and convene IPT meetings periodically. Permanent IPT membership will consist of
        representatives from AFMC, AF/A4LM, contractor ICPs and DLA.
        2.10.2.3.9. Product Support Manager (PSM).
        2.10.2.3.10. PSMs will appoint primary and alternate AF WSSP Workbench focal
        points for WSDCs assigned to weapon systems they support. WSSP focal points will
        be responsible for maintaining WSSP records assigned to their WSDCs. This
        includes ensuring NSN adds/changes/deletes are processed through the AF WSSP
        Workbench. PSM personnel will notify AFMC WSSP Functional OPR when
        systems are deactivated so WSDCs can be removed from WSSP. (T-2).
            2.10.2.3.10.1. Essentiality code (EC). 1 will be assigned to all DLA-managed
            repair parts for an LRU, when lack of that LRU will render the aircraft/weapon
            system it supports inoperable or grounded. If the aircraft/weapon system is not
            rendered inoperable or grounded, then the EC should be the appropriate EC other
            than "1."
        2.10.2.3.11. Nominate weapon systems to AFMC to be included in the WSSP
        program in accordance with the following time frames:
            2.10.2.3.11.1. For systems to be provisioned--no later than 4 months prior to the
            start of the provisioning process.
            2.10.2.3.11.2. Systems in the active inventory--no later than 2 months before a
            system will require DLA parts support.
     2.10.2.4. WSSP Eligibility. Only those weapon systems requiring DLA parts support
     will be registered in the DLA WSSP. Also, support systems/subsystems providing direct
     and immediate support to weapon systems (i.e., trainers, simulators, engines, support
     equipment, communications-electronic systems/subsystems) relating to a priority weapon
     system may be nominated for WSSP inclusion.
        2.10.2.4.1. The following guidance will apply for nominating weapon systems:
            2.10.2.4.1.1. All new WSDC requests will initially be assigned WSGC level C.
 94                                                            AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


            Upgrade to WSGC level A or B will be made, if required, during the next annual
            WSDC WSGC review.
            2.10.2.4.1.2. WSGC level A will be limited to weapon systems designed as
            instruments of combat, either offensive or defensive, issued to destroy, injure,
            defeat, or threaten the enemy. These systems require the most intensive
            management to support performance goals and readiness objectives. WSGC level
            A may also include weapon systems experiencing long-term readiness problems
            or failures of supply support where the condition can be improved by
            management and resource reallocation with DLA.
            2.10.2.4.1.3. WSGC level B will be limited priority systems that are designed for
            and have a primary combatant function, or provide supplemental, direct, and
            immediate support to a combatant weapon system or situation. These systems
            require intensive management to support performance goals and readiness
            objectives.
            2.10.2.4.1.4. WSGC level C will be assigned to systems not requiring intensive
            management to reach assigned performance goals and readiness objectives.

     2.11.3.2. AFSPBP applies to:
         2.11.3.2.1. Any centrally managed replenishment or provisioned part for military
         systems and equipment.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                         97


        2.11.3.2.2. All DoD personnel involved with design control, acquisition, and
        management of such parts including, but not limited to project, program, and system
        managers, technical personnel, contracting officers, legal counsel, inventory
        managers, inspectors, and small business specialist and technical advisors.
     2.11.3.3. The AFSPBP does not apply to:
        2.11.3.3.1. Foreign military sale peculiar items.
        2.11.3.3.2. INS items.
        2.11.3.3.3. Local Purchase.

        components or field activities.
        2.11.3.3.8. Component breakout
     2.11.3.4. An AMC and AMSC are assigned to provide the best possible technical
     assessment of how a part can be procured.
        2.11.3.4.1. The technical assessment will be based on factors such as: the availability
        of adequate technical data, the government’s rights to use the data, technical
        restrictions placed on the hardware, and breakout cost versus projected savings.
            2.11.3.4.1.1. A part does not have to be coded as noncompetitive based on an
            initial market survey that only uncovers one interested source. If sufficient
            technical data is in the government’s possession to enable other sources to
            manufacture an acceptable part and there are no technical restrictions on the part
            which would preclude other sources from manufacturing it, the part should be
            coded competitive. Note: Component breakout under DFARS PGI 217.7506.
  2.11.4. General Guidance:
     2.11.4.1. The breakout program develops supplemental procedures, processes and
     policies to accomplish the screening process detailed in DFARS PGI 217.7506.
     2.11.4.2. To aid breakout to competition or direct purchase, AFMC identify, select, and
     screen parts for breakout as early in an acquisition as possible.
        2.11.4.2.1. This AFMC review should occur during the provisioning cycle. However,
        because parts are not fully standardized early in the acquisition process, the optimum
        solution may be breakout to the actual manufacturer.
     2.11.4.3. AFMC Breakout Program Managers apply resources and assign priorities to
     those parts that have the greatest opportunity for breakout and potential savings.
     2.11.4.4. The AF may not deny any firm the opportunity to demonstrate its ability to
     furnish a part that satisfies AF needs. For specific guidance regarding qualification, refer
     to FAR 9.202.
98                                                                  AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


         2.11.4.4.1. The evaluating AF activity expedites its evaluation and gives a decision to
         the demonstrating firm or provides status within 60 days. The contracting officer need
         not delay a proposed award to give a potential offeror an opportunity to demonstrate
         its ability to meet the qualification standards.
         2.11.4.4.2. The AFMC Air Logistics Complex may consider parts manufactured by
         approved sources, and then offered by surplus or other nonmanufacturing sources.
         Restrictive codes or low annual buy value does not preclude such consideration.
         2.11.4.4.3. Dealer or other nonmanufacturing sources must give the AF all necessary
         facts to prove that the proposed parts meet the AF's needs. The AF considers
         authorized dealers and distributors identified through appropriate contracting
         documents as nonmanufacturing sources of commercial items.
     2.11.4.5. To aid breakout decision making, the AF may use contractors' experience in
     developing, designing, manufacturing, and testing equipment.
         2.11.4.5.1. The AF may get technical information from the contractor through the
         GEIA-STD-007 as part of the provisioning process or directly from the contractor,
         applying DFARS PGI 217-7506.
         2.11.4.5.2. The AF designates contractor technical information as CTIC. The AF
         may not delegate responsibility for determining AMC and AMSC to a contractor.
         2.11.4.5.3. AFMC request contractor help in screening selected parts only after
         weighing the benefit expected from the contractor's technical information and the cost
         to the government of obtaining such help. Program managers may not request
         contractor help for:
             2.11.4.5.3.1. Parts covered by government and industry specifications.
             2.11.4.5.3.2. Parts that are commercially available.
             2.11.4.5.3.3. Non-developmental items.
             2.11.4.5.3.4. Parts for which data is already available.
         2.11.4.5.4. Contracts to obtain technical information require impartial technical
         evaluations conducted by competent personnel using applicable technical data. The
         government incurs no cost for duplicate screening of parts.
     2.11.4.6. Upon receipt of a funded MILSTRIP requisition from an authorized AF activity
     or a Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) from an authorized
     agency/service, AFMC will screen for items that the AF has engineering responsibility
     and are not assigned an Acquisition Method Code.
     2.11.4.7. Inadequate or incomplete procurement data packages limit competition for
     future procurement candidate items. Buying required data or acquiring the necessary data
     through reverse engineering may relieve the limitations. However, the life-cycle savings
     should clearly exceed the expected cost of acquiring data, or reverse engineering.
  2.11.5. Identifying, Selecting, and Screening Parts:
     2.11.5.1. Provisioned parts are subject to breakout.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     99


        2.11.5.1.1. Throughout this breakout process, the AF should purchase items directly
        from the actual manufacturer whenever possible to avert added distributor and retailer
        costs.
        2.11.5.1.2. Actual screening of provisioned parts is not normally practical because
        the parts lack design stability.
     2.11.5.2. Generally, program managers need to periodically replenish provisioned parts.
        2.11.5.2.1. Managers may use provisioning lists or similar lists of new parts for
        selecting parts for screening.
        2.11.5.2.2. Managers base screening priorities on design stability, performance
        stability, and anticipated replenishment. They also consider buy values, buy
        quantities, and the availability of technical data.
        2.11.5.2.3. Managers should make efforts to fully screen parts as they enter the
        inventory.
            2.11.5.2.3.1. Parts should meet the above criteria.
            2.11.5.2.3.2. The managing activity should program parts for replenishment
            procurement.
     2.11.5.3. AMCs and AMSCs are valid until the next assigned review date. The review
     may vary by organization and part. Coding activities may assign a review date of less
     than 5 years if available information indicates that no change in code is expected.
        2.11.5.3.1. Suspense dates may vary with the circumstances surrounding each part.
            2.11.5.3.1.1. AMSCs may receive suspense dates of: 24 months or less, 3 years, 5
            years or 10 years.
            2.11.5.3.1.2. Items with a 1G or 2G code do not require a suspense date.
            However, management may dictate a periodic review of the parts assigned these
            codes.
        2.11.5.3.2. Program managers track the availability of data and the technical status of
        proposed actions to improve the competitive status until completion.
     2.11.5.4. When an activity generates a buy requirement estimated to be over the
     screening threshold for a part without the current AMC or AMSC, the part is submitted
     for screening actions according to either the full or limited screening procedures in
     accordance with DFARS PGI 217.7506.
     2.11.5.5. Challenges to a suspect AMC/AMSC will be reviewed to verify the code.
     2.11.5.6. When events occur which may improve the competitive condition of a part and
     may result in recoding, management must conduct the screening and subsequent recoding
     promptly without waiting for future procurement requests. Examples of actions that fall
     into this class are:
        2.11.5.6.1. Receipt of a technical data package.
        2.11.5.6.2. Release of proprietary rights.
        2.11.5.6.3. Completion of a reverse engineering project.
100                                                              AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


      2.11.5.7. Screening procedures for parts may vary depending on circumstances. No set of
      rules cover all conditions. Program managers may make an informed decision to breakout
      without following the procedures step-by-step in every case. However, they should do the
      following in all cases:
         2.11.5.7.1. Obtain, consider, and record the necessary supporting facts.
         2.11.5.7.2. Involve contractors in the decision-making process only to the extent of
         providing technical information.
         2.11.5.7.3. Document any coding conferences with industry.
         2.11.5.7.4. Determine through screening whether a part is suitable for competitive
         acquisition.
             2.11.5.7.4.1. It may be possible to break out the part for direct purchase from the
             actual manufacturer.
             2.11.5.7.4.2. Parts with data belonging to the actual manufacturer and not likely
             to be procured by the government are particularly suited to direct purchase. Such
             direct purchase is particularly appropriate if the manufacturer assumes total
             responsibility for the part, including its design, quality control, and testing.
         2.11.5.7.5. For each screened part, establish a file to document and justify the
         decisions and results of all screening efforts. Keep this file on-hand to supply
         historical data for subsequent screening.
         2.11.5.7.6. After a part gets an AMC and AMSC, screening does not cease. The
         screening process continues as the AF receives documentation or contractor responses
         until management assigns a competitive code or exhausts all efforts to improve the
         code status.
         2.11.5.7.7. Before completing the recoding action, the responsible engineering
         activity reviews and concurs with proposed changes to all screening packages.
  2.11.6. Reporting Instructions:
      2.11.6.1. The Spare Parts Breakout Screening Report (RCS DD P&L [QS&A]714A) is a
      cumulative semiannual report detailing the accomplishments of the breakout program.
      The report describes full and limited screening for provisioning and replenishment parts
      by the number of different NSN for each AMC.
      2.11.6.2. The Spare Parts Acquisition Report (RCS: DD P&K[QS&A] 714B) is a
      cumulative semiannual report documenting all spare part purchases during the current
      fiscal year. The report describes the number and extended-dollar value of different NSNs
      purchased for each AMC.
      2.11.6.3. The AF maintains actual cost-savings (or cost avoidance) data attributable to
      the AFSPBP and include the data in the semiannual Spare Parts Acquisition Report.
      2.11.6.4. The AF purchases reported in the Spare Parts Acquisition Report may not
      match the screenings reported in the Spare Parts Breakout Screening Report because of
      time differences between screenings and actual purchases and procurement lead-times.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     101


      2.11.6.5. The AFSPBP Costs required for the Spare Parts Breakout Screening Report
      come from the SH069-LO3, RC Managers Cost Center Report. Activities should use
      EEIC 392, Other Civilian Personnel Compensation, Gross Obligation to reflect their
      costs.
      2.11.6.6. Reports are due to AF/A4LM 30 days after the end of each reporting period
      (October through March and April through September).
      2.11.6.7. Correct and revise the midyear reports in the year-end reports. Year-end reports
      may not be revised.

  2.12.2. TRAP Categories.
      2.12.2.1. WRM. WRM TRAP assets include the following subcategories: combat,
      current operations, and forward presence.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   103


     2.12.2.2. Peacetime Operating Stocks. POS TRAP assets include the following
     subcategories: AME, NIE, Test and Evaluation, and training. Note: All categories of
     TRAP assets are subject to consumption during wartime and peacetime operations.
  2.12.3. Funding.
     2.12.3.1. TRAP items are procured with 3400/72834/63817 CAM funds; LEAN Support
     Equipment (SE). This includes TRAP war consumables previously procured with aircraft
     3010/BP17 funds. Care must be exercised to ensure TRAP procurement funds
     (3400/72834/63817) can be executed within the FY they are received since these funds
     are one (1) year funds.
     2.12.3.2. WRM is war consumables equipment purchased with 3400/72834/63817 CAM
     (LEAN SE) funds. These additional TRAP items are used to replenish projected losses
     that are forecast to occur during wartime operations.
  2.12.4. TRAP Requirements Determination.
     2.12.4.1. WRM TRAP requirements will be determined annually through a year-long
     process that begins with the MWG. Attendees will include various representatives from
     Air Staff, AFMC TRAP Activity, applicable sustainment depots, the combat MAJCOMs,
     and other key personnel.
     2.12.4.2. The latest theater war plans, force structure documents, operational, and other
     pertinent inputs will be reviewed at the TWG meeting(s) to develop and determine WRM
     TRAP requirements.
     2.12.4.3. Modeling, war plan review, current and projected force structure review, and
     manual inputs will be used to develop viable, defendable WRM TRAP requirements.
     2.12.4.4. WRM TRAP requirements will be published in the NCAA. The NCAA
     provides near term (budget year) WRM requirements; out year (6 years hence) WRM
     TRAP requirements; TRAP Inventory Objectives (IO); and midterm TRAP requirements.
         2.12.4.4.1. Budget year requirements will be considered in determining near term
         stockage levels.
         2.12.4.4.2. The out year WRM requirement is based on projected inventories of
         TRAP items and supported munitions; it is the basis for determining excesses for
         demilitarization, foreign military sales, etc., when compared to IOs.
         2.12.4.4.3. The out year TRAP IO supports an optimum mix of existing and
         developing weapons and is used as a basis for procurement decisions. The IOs may
         be less than the sum of MAJCOM-identified WRM TRAP requirement.
         2.12.4.4.4. The midterm WRM TRAP requirements will be used for continuing trend
         analysis.
     2.12.4.5. WRM TRAP item apportionment will be computed in the NCAA and identified
     as theater starter objectives.
     2.12.4.6. TRAP requirements will be forwarded to the AFMC TRAP Activity and TRAP
     IMs. TRAP requirements will be file maintained and implemented in the applicable
     AFMC materiel management IT system’s instructions for scheduling TRAP depot repair
104                                                           AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


      actions. These coordinated instructions, along with the current near and out year NCAA
      TRAP requirements, will be transmitted to each applicable AFMC Air Logistics Complex
      for review.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     105


                                           Chapter 3

                               SOURCING OF MATERIEL

Section 3A—Overview

3.1. Overview. This chapter outlines AF guidance for the supply chain materiel management
processes associated with the sourcing of materiel activities. These activities include Local
Purchase and Retail Sales; Receipt Processing, Item Management; and Diminishing
Manufacturing Sources and Materiel Shortages. For this chapter, DoD 4140.1-R, DoD 4140.26-
M, serve as primary DoD sources and various AF publications also serve as references.

Section 3B—Local Purchase and Retail Sales

3.2. Local Purchase and Retail Sales.
   3.2.1. Local Purchase (LP), is a request for supplies and equipment which is initiated from a
   materiel management information technology system and transmitted through an interface
   with the local Contracting office or equivalent. Local purchase is an authorized SOS as
   defined in Part 8 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Requests for items of supply
   to be locally procured may be requested only after all government supply and mandatory
   sources have been exhausted. Public law requires all federal agencies to micro-purchase
   products less than $3,000 IAW with the FAR 13.2 and 2.101 using the GPC outlined in the
   FAR 13.301 and AFI 64-117. The procurement of Local Purchase items will comply with the
   Air Force Green Procurement Program which supports Executive Order 13514, October 5,
   2009, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance; the FAR,
   Subpart 23.4—Use of Recovered Materials and Biobased Products; and AFI 32-7001,
   Environmental Management.
   3.2.2. For AF retail supply accounts, the use of LP is defined for the following customer
   requests:
       3.2.2.1. Cataloged NSN’s with a unit price over $5,000 with an Acquisition Advice Code
       of “L”.
       3.2.2.2. Non Cataloged items requiring equipment accountability with a unit price over
       $5,000.
   3.2.3. Responsibilities.
       3.2.3.1. AF/A4LM is responsible for:
          3.2.3.1.1. Providing overall LP supply policy guidance
       3.2.3.2. AFMC is responsible for:
          3.2.3.2.1. Exercising technical control of the LP program for assigned commodities.
          3.2.3.2.2. Reviewing items assigned to determine method of management.
          3.2.3.2.3. Providing LP supply for items coded LP, where sources could not be found
          locally.
106                                                                AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


         3.2.3.2.4. Authorizing waivers for investment items, providing obligation authority to

                transaction (latest notice only).
                4.2.2.4.2.1.5. Notification of kit shipments. These notifications may be
                maintained in a central file provided that the letters, messages, and the AF
                Form 2001 are cross-referenced
            4.2.2.4.2.2. TCTO kit reconciliations. These assets are reconciled with the
            LRS/Materiel Management Activity on a monthly basis. The purpose of this
            reconciliation is to validate kit availability, shortages, excesses, due-outs, and
            due-ins.
         4.2.2.4.3. Will ensure establishment of a TCTO Kit Item Record.
  4.2.3. Kit Guidance.
     4.2.3.1. TCTO kits will contain all parts/material necessary to accomplish the
     modification, except as noted in TO 00-5-15.
     4.2.3.2. Kitted TCTOs are assembled at the wholesale level and provided free of charge
     to base units.
     4.2.3.3. Non-kitted TCTOs are assembled by the end user or customer at the base level
     when directed by AFMC and lead command concurs.
  4.2.4. Assembly of Kits.
     4.2.4.1. TCTOs will indicate how the kits will be assembled, obtained, and funded.
     4.2.4.2. Billing Base-Assembled TCTO Kits. To make it easier to bill expenses incurred
     for the base assembly of TCTO kits, an OCCR and Project Funds Management Record
     (PFMR) are loaded for each kit and/or source of funds. The supply activity will load the
     OCCR using an organization code in the 100-999 series and type organization code K.
     (T-3). The responsibility center/cost center code will be 99xxxx, as provided by
     Accounting & Finance (A&F). Upon receiving authority to assemble a kit at base level,
     the TCTO Kit Monitor will furnish A&F the TCTO kit number, the appropriate funding
     source, and the A&F disbursing station number.
 112                                                               AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


       4.2.4.3. Inclusion of Unauthorized Materiel in TCTO Kits. When a modification requires
       materiel not authorized for inclusion in the kit--such as explosives, NWRM, munitions,
       or medical items--the item or system manager (IM/SM) responsible for the modification
       will provide appropriate funding for the required materiel to the activity developing or
       assembling the kit. (T-2). The end user activity will then obtain the required materiel. All
       such items will be kitted separately and identified as part of the total TCTO kit so that
       proper safety measures can be taken. (T-2).
       4.2.4.4. Deviations from the Complete Kit Guidance. Deviations from the complete kit
       guidance require waivers agreed to by the lead command. Acceptance of a deviation from
       the complete kit concept accepts the financial and manpower burden of kit buildup at
       base level.     Host command LRS/Materiel Management Activities will accept
       responsibility for kit buildup of incomplete TCTO kits waived by a tenant unit's
       MAJCOM. (T-2). Items excluded from TCTO kits by waiver are acquired from existing
       organizational resources or purchased through regular supply channels as necessary.
       Waivers may be approved by the AFMC Cryptological System Activity when the AF
       Cryptologic Depot is the PM/Technical Content Manager (TCM) (not AFMC managed).
       See TO 00-5-15 for the policies on granting waivers. Note: When the need is urgent and
       a using command has adequate materiel assets but not at the requiring bases, it may be
       necessary to redistribute the materiel laterally to complete the TCTO kits.
   4.2.5. Shelf Life Item Control.
       4.2.5.1. Kitted TCTOs containing shelf life items will be assigned a shelf life code of the
       shortest shelf life item in the kit. (T-2).
       4.2.5.2. When shelf life items become outdated, normal shelf life control procedures will
       apply IAW AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5C, Physical Asset Management. (T-2).
   4.2.6. TCTO items will only be released for MICAP conditions. (T-2).
   4.2.7. Incomplete Kits. AF bases/activities will notify the PM/TCM responsible for the
   TCTO of any kit shortages. (T-2).
   4.2.8. Rescission of TCTO. Rescission of the TCTO will be done IAW TO 00-5-15. (T-2).
   4.2.9. Completed TCTO Kit Files. Upon completion of TCTO, the completed jacket file will
   be retained as specified in the AF Records Disposition Schedule. (T-2).

        delivered to the FSC. Customers will ensure that items contain proper documentation
        prior to pick up. Proper documentation includes: AFTO Form 350, Reparable Item
        Processing Tag, condition tags and DD Form 1348-1A, Issue, Release/Receipt
        Document or AMS label. If an item is missing required packaging, an AF Form 451,
        Request for Packing Service, will be included with DIFM returns IAW AFI 24-203.
        See AFMAN 23-122, para 6.2.2.5.3. for documentation required for FOB returns
        resulting from ICBM weapon system deactivation and/or modification. Documented
        Cargo personnel are not required to inspect or complete documentation. The FSC will
        inspect/process DIFM assets IAW with AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 6B, Returns. FSC
        personnel will take delivery of DIFM items and coordinate with the owning unit for
        discrepancies with packaging and/or documentation. (T-2).
  4.3.2. DIFM management. The materiel management IT system establishes a DIFM record
  and tracks the unserviceable asset until it is repaired, evacuated, or condemned.
     4.3.2.1. All DIFM monitors will attend Block IIB Repair Cycle Training. (T-2).
     4.3.2.2. Multiple DIFM indicators. The materiel management IT system will reject a
     DIFM issue processed for a quantity of more than one each. If more than one of a
     particular item needs to be requested, the customer will submit a multiple DIFM request
     (with document justification, e.g. TO reference) to the LRS/Materiel Management
     Activity for approval. The LRS will retain document justification for duration of the
     DIFM indicator. (T-3).
     4.3.2.3. Maintenance turnarounds (TRN). The LRS/Materiel Management Activity will
     maintain close coordination with maintenance activities to expedite turnaround
     processing.
        4.3.2.3.1. The LRS/materiel management activity will appoint a primary and
        alternate TRN manager in writing to act as the single point of contact for all TRN
        actions. (T-3).
        4.3.2.3.2. DIFM turn-ins. All DIFM assets will be returned to the LRS/Materiel
        Management Activity in the appropriate reusable container with the required
        documentation IAW Sec. 6B, Returns of this instruction. (T-2).

      4.3.2.4. DELETED
      4.3.2.5. Non-2LM reparable items will be turned-in by Maintenance within 4 days for
      serviceable assets and 10 days for unserviceable assets. The determination of the
      disposition of these assets; whether the assets can be repaired or not, should be made
      within the threshold criteria stated above. If the asset can be repaired and is cost
      beneficial to repair, management may decide more time is needed to complete the repair.
      In this case, the correct DIFM code should be applied to accurately reflect the status and
      location of the asset. If the asset cannot be repaired the asset will be turned-in by
      Maintenance to allow resupply. Unauthorized delays in the repair cycle process should be
      reported to correct any actions or processes causing the delays.

     Separate EAID will be assigned to each military mission attaché, or section of an
     advisory group for which the AF has been designated to provide support. (T-2).
     5.4.3.14. Military Working Dogs. Military working dogs (MWD) are scout, sentry,
     patrol, tracker, and detector narcotic/contraband dogs the AF requires for a specific
     purpose, mission, or combat capability. AFI 23-126(I), DoD Military Working Dog
     Program and AFI 31-121, Military Working Dog Program, contain processing policies
     and procedures for MWD. These dogs will be maintained on authorized/in-use detail
     records.
     5.4.3.15. Other Government Managed Vehicle Conveyances (OGMVCs). OGMVC are
     slow moving conveyances (e.g. golf carts, scooters) not meeting LSV criteria. (Exception
     is Other Government Motor Vehicle Conveyances (OGMVCs) purchased with NAF

      5.4.3.16. Portable Buildings. A portable building is defined as a small, shed-type
      structure with less than 300 square feet with no permanently installed Base Civil
      Engineer utility hookups. These buildings are not suitable for human habitation and do
      not satisfy requirements for permanent real property. They are designed to be moved
      intact from one place to another by means of a flat-bed trailer and, therefore, are not
      considered vehicular (wheeled) equipment. Portable buildings are purchased with budget
      code 9, local purchase (JBB) funds.
      5.4.3.17. Training Equipment. Training equipment authorizations required to support
      training courses outlined in Education and Training Course Announcements or developed
      IAW AETCI 36-2203 or AETCI 36-2221 for resident school, field training detachment
      (FTD), and flying training courses are derived from allowance standards (AS) of the
      same functional area or weapon system allowance standard.
         5.4.3.17.1. Individual basis of issue (BOI) for AETC training equipment
         requirements will not be cited in allowance standards due to variation in student
         loads, duration of courses and other variable factors which preclude identity of fixed
         allowances. The only exceptions to this policy are nuclear weapons-related equipment
         cited in AS 805 (Nuclear Weapons Training), weapons-related equipment cited in AS
         538ACFB (AETC Students/Deployers Requiring Weapons Training), and
         COMSEC/CCI equipment (Serialized Report Code “C”).
         5.4.3.17.2. A single organization and shop code will be established for each course or
         FTD weapon system Mission Design Series (MDS) Training units with equipment in
         multiple locations may have multiple equipment accounts. The unit’s organization
         identification code (Org ID) will be consolidated at the appropriate level (i.e., wing,
         group, squadron) and will be assigned by HQ AETC/A4R. (T-2).
             5.4.3.17.2.1. The equipment custodian will provide a single AETC Form 120,
             Training Equipment List, or AETC Form 120A, Field Training Equipment List,
             for each course or MDS. The AETC Form 120/120A is utilized as the allowance
             standard for the course or FTD. Custodians will list items in stock number
             sequence and indicate maximum authorizations. (T-2).
             5.4.3.17.2.2. A new AETC Form 120/120A will be provided whenever the
             custodian requests authorization changes, additions, or deletions. The AETC
             Form 120/120A must accompany a cover letter signed by the
             Organizational/Detachment Commander, Director, or Flight Chief. The letter
             must indicate any required authorization changes and identify any quantity that
             supply must order. The letter and AETC Form 120/120A will be kept in the
             Master Jacket File and the Custodian Jacket File. The new AETC Form 120/120A
             and signed cover letter will replace superseded forms and letters in both files. (T-
             2).
         5.4.3.17.3. The LRS EAE will cite the AS of the functional area or weapon system
         followed by alpha “O” (e.g., 734OOOO). (T-2).
         5.4.3.17.4. Equipment authorizations on the AETC Form 120/120A will be validated
         annually by the custodian. (T-2).
  5.4.4. Allowance Standards-Issue and Control.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     145


     5.4.4.1. Basis of Issue (BOI). The BOI in allowance standards is normally the maximum
     quantity for nonexpendable items which may be authorized. BOI for funded (BC 9)
     Equipment are advisory only and are not restricted to the identified users. Note: The
     commander is authorized to exceed the BOI in weapons system support allowance
     standards if the prime authorization is base funded (BC9 ). Base funds cannot be used to
     procure alpha budget coded items.
     5.4.4.2. Allowance Standard Items. Allowance standards normally list the master item in
     the ISG. All prime authorization records will reflect the stock number prescribed in the
     allowance standard. A prime NSN will not be substituted for another prime. If another
     prime meets your requirement, submit a change request.
     5.4.4.3. ASCs 081, 082, and 083 are reserved for special equipment management
     purpose and may only be used when directed by AF/A4LE. These ASCs will only be
     used when a need exists to account for equipment which has been returned from a theater
     of operation, deployment, or other significant operation. (T-2). The approval period is not
     to be indefinite and is to be sufficient to resolve the problems necessitating use of these
     ASCs.
     5.4.4.4. Nonexpendable Items. Generally, only nonexpendable items will be listed in
     allowance standards. (Expendable items may be listed for the user's information).
     Personnel may request quantities of expendable items that exceed the basis of issue in
     applicable allowance standards, except for specialized tools, personal retention and
     survival items, components of bench sets, and WRM. EMC 1 items are normally
     excluded from EAID accountable records, but may be included in allowance standards.
     5.4.4.5. Authorizations for training equipment required to support training courses
     outlined in education and training course announcements and developed IAW AETCI 36-
     2203 or 36-2221 are derived from allowance standards of the same functional area or
     weapon system allowance standard.
        5.4.4.5.1. Individual basis of issue (BOI) for AETC requirements will not be cited in
        allowance standards due to variation in student loads, duration of courses and other
        variable factors which preclude identity of fixed allowances. The BOI cited for AETC
        use is one per instructional group. An instructional group is the maximum number of
        students whose training may be accomplished using one set of course related support
        equipment.
  5.4.5. Transfer and Deployment of Equipment.
     5.4.5.1. Transfer of accountability will be the preferred method to move equipment.
     Movement of all accountable equipment in support of contingency, humanitarian, and/or
     disaster relief operations will be accomplished using transfer procedures when an ELRS
     or host materiel management support is available. (T-1).
        5.4.5.1.1. National Emergency. To support national emergencies, transfer procedures
        will be followed. (T-1). All replacement issues should be processed with the name of
        the emergency or national disaster listed in the “mark for field”.
        5.4.5.1.2. NWRM. For guidance applicable to NWRM assets, refer to Sec. 10B of
        this instruction.

         5.4.5.1.3. The primary method to move equipment for ANG and AFRC will be to
         deploy not transfer. Transfer of ANG and AFRC equipment can only occur when the
         ANG/AFRC CEMOs have determined that it is excess to their needs. Excess ANG
         and AFRC equipment will follow transfer procedures. Transfer of ANG and AFRC
         equipment that is not excess can only be transferred if DoDI 1225.6; AFI 10-402,
         Mobilization Planning and AFH 10-416, Personnel Readiness and Mobilization are
         complied with first. Additionally, at least 45 days prior to initiating ANG/AFRC
         equipment transfers, gaining MAJCOMs will provide a replacement plan to
         AF/A4LE for staffing and subsequent approval with the SECDEF through the
         Assistant SECDEF for Reserve Affairs (ASD (RA).). AF/A4LE will forward the
         approved plan and proposal for withdrawal, diversion, or reduction of equipment to
         the ANG/AFRC CEMOs. (T-1).
      5.4.5.2. Deployment. The use of deployment procedures are authorized under the
      following conditions:
         5.4.5.2.1. There is no ELRS or host materiel management support available at the
         gaining operating location.
         5.4.5.2.2. To support the movement of equipment for peace time exercises, short-
         term contingencies of less than 30 days and training deployments.
         5.4.5.2.3. When an individual deploys with equipment issued on a per individual
         basis (1 each to an individual) such as military working dogs and weapons.
         5.4.5.2.4. When aircrew flight equipment assets remain on the aircraft during
         deployment and return to home station.

      quarterly, semiannual, or annual complete inventory requirements. The LRS CC/AO has
      the authority to conduct inventories more frequently for assets on their accountable
      record.
      5.7.4.2. Closed warehouse inventory. A closed warehouse inventory is the normal
      method for conducting inventories. During a closed warehouse inventory, only
      emergency issue transactions are removed from the warehouse. Emergency issues are
      defined as priority designator 01-08 requests. Ensure all transactions affecting locations
      have been pulled or putaway prior to a physical count. Emergency issues will be
      processed as degraded operations transactions and will be recorded on the inventory
      recap sheet. The materiel management officer will exercise care to ensure that the
      warehouse does not remain closed to normal receipts and issues for an unreasonable
      length of time and is immediately reopened after completion of the count. (T-3).
      5.7.4.3. Open warehouse inventory. An open warehouse inventory is a method whereby
      normal receipt and issue transactions continue during the course of the inventory. Supply
      documents that are processed on and subsequent to the deadline date until completion of
      count, and what affects the stock record balances, will be recorded and considered in the
      physical count process.
      5.7.4.4. Inventory types. Only two types of inventory counts are authorized to ensure the
      accuracy of base materiel inventory records. They are complete counts and special
      counts. Complete inventories will only be taken by the closed warehouse method.
         5.7.4.4.1. Complete Inventory Counts. Complete inventory counts are designed for
         conducting inventory counts of all items within specified parameters; i.e., location or
         category of property. Complete inventory counts are conducted using the closed
         warehouse-method of inventory. This method applies to all stock record account
         codes, satellites, and custodial accounts. Procedures for conducting complete
         inventory counts are in AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5G, Physical Inventory and Inventory
         Adjustments.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                      157


           5.7.4.4.2. Special Inventory Counts. Special inventory counts are used to reconcile
           out-of-balance conditions that are discovered during other than complete inventory
           counts. Special inventory counts apply to all on-hand and in-use supply and
           equipment items and may be conducted in either the open or closed warehouse
           method or IAW applicable higher level guidance (e.g. higher headquarters message).
       5.7.4.5. Requirements for classified, sensitive, and pilferable items.
           5.7.4.5.1. Inventory personnel must possess a security clearance equal to the highest
           category of classified materiel that they inventory. (T-2).
           5.7.4.5.2. Waivers of research for minor inventory adjustments are not permissible
           for classified, pilferable, or sensitive items.
           5.7.4.5.3. For automatic data processing equipment (ADPE) inventory procedures
           reference AFI 33-112 for guidance.
   5.7.5. Inventory adjustment approval, certification and reporting accuracy.
       5.7.5.1. Approval/Authentication of inventory adjustments. All inventory adjustment
       which does not qualify for automatic adjustment will be approved by the Materiel
       Management Flight Commander /Chief or equivalent prior to processing the
       adjustment. Approval requires verification all inventory post count validation and pre-
       adjustment research actions have been completed. (T-3).
       5.7.5.2. Tracking and reporting inventory accuracy. The LGRM or equivalent is
       responsible to ensure causative research is accomplished IAW criteria listed in para
       5.7.10.3 of this instruction for inventory adjustments. Causative research results will be
       analyzed and used with other inventory adjustment and discrepancy trend data; fraud,
       waste, and abuse indicators/reports; and for reviewing other management/security
       products to monitor the integrity of base resource management processes. This analysis
       will be formally presented to the LRS CC/AO. Refer to para 5.7.11 for more information.
       (T-3).
   5.7.6. Inventory frequency. The frequency of inventory counts is specified based upon
   category of item.
       5.7.6.1. All materiel management and equipment items, in storage or in use, will be
       subject to inventory count as follows: (T-2).

     5.7.6.2. Waiver of requirements for inventory.
         5.7.6.2.1. Local management is authorized to delay and reschedule inventory work
         within the same fiscal year without approval of higher headquarters.
         5.7.6.2.2. Delay of inventory work up to the end of the next fiscal year is authorized
         by the MAJCOM if such action is deemed appropriate and advisable.
         5.7.6.2.3. AF/A4LM will approve suspension of inventory work or delay in the
         accomplishment of inventory of a selected lot longer than two fiscal years.
  5.7.7. Special inventories.
     5.7.7.1. Special inventories will be accomplished and necessary adjustments made
     without delay but NLT 30 days IAW DLM 4000.25-2-M.
     5.7.7.2. Misidentified Serialized Control CCI/COMSEC Items. Special inventory
     procedures must be used to re-identify serialized control CCI/COMSEC items.
  5.7.8. Inventory Accuracy Standards.
     5.7.8.1. Inventory Accuracy standards are set IAW DLM 4000.25-2-M (Table C7.T1).
  5.7.9. Automatic Inventory adjustment guidance.
     5.7.9.1. The dollar value for automatic inventory adjustment, computed by multiplying
     the adjusted quantity by the unit price, is within the following limits:
         5.7.9.1.1. Pilferable items less than $100.00.
         5.7.9.1.2. Controlled item code U, unclassified items less than $1,000.00. Note:
         Items with controlled item code 7, although considered unclassified for storage and
         handling purposes, require research prior to adjustment. The loss, theft, unlawful
         disposition, and/or recovery of an item in this category will be investigated in
         accordance with DLM 4000.25-2-M and DoD 7200.10-M. (T-0).
  5.7.10. Inventory Research. The objective of inventory research is to identify causes for out
  of balance conditions. Specific types of errors can include errors in inventory counts,
  transaction processing, and transactions that may not have been posted to the recap sheet. As
  a minimum the following research will be conducted: (T-3).
     5.7.10.1. Post count validation will be done for all out of balance discrepancies (T-3).
     Post count validation is a comparison of physical count to recorded balances with
     consideration for transactions that have occurred since the date of last inventory. Post
     count validation research ends when the accuracy of the original inventory count has
     been verified or when any necessary recounts have been taken.
     5.7.10.2. Pre-adjustment research will occur on all manual adjustments. Pre-adjustment
     research is a review of potential discrepancies, which involves the review of all
     transactions to include supporting documentation: catalog change actions, shipment
     discrepancies, and un-posted or rejected documentation occurring since the last
     completed inventory; the last location reconciliation which included quantity; or back one
     year whichever is sooner. The purpose of pre-adjustment research is to determine the
     correct balance. Pre-adjustment research ends when the balance has been verified or the
     required adjustment quantity has been determined.
 160                                                              AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


          5.7.10.2.1. For Unclassified and Pilferable assets, the maximum time to complete
          pre-adjustment research is 7 calendar days.
          5.7.10.2.2. For NWRM, Sensitive and Classified assets, the maximum time to
          complete pre-adjustment research is 5 calendar days.
       5.7.10.3. Causative research will be accomplished for all pilferable items valued over
       $100, all other controlled items, DIFMs, and adjustments greater than $1,000. (T-2). The
       purpose of causative research is to identify, analyze, and evaluate the root cause of
       inventory discrepancies with the aim of eliminating repetitive errors. Causative research
       ends when the cause of the discrepancy has been discovered or when, after a thorough
       review of the transactions, no conclusive findings are possible.
   5.7.11. Inventory Analysis. An analysis will be made of inventory adjustments that have
   been processed and potential variances resolved. Analysis can reveal trends that can be a
   valuable tool toward gaining effective asset control by identifying areas of current and
   potential high loss. Inventory Analysis will be performed monthly to accomplish the
   following: (T-3).
       5.7.11.1. To identify failures in the control systems so improvements can be made.
       5.7.11.2. To reduce similar discrepancies in the future.
       5.7.11.3. To evaluate indicators of trends or system problems for corrective action.
       5.7.11.4. To ensure that the proper inventory adjustment and proper controls were
       asserted.
          5.7.11.4.1. For inventory adjustment of AF items with a Security Classification, to
          ensure actions required for Threat Reduction/Controlled Material items were
          followed. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5G, Physical Inventory and Inventory
          Adjustments for appropriate procedures.
       5.7.11.5. For areas with a high rate of inventory adjustments, extra controls will be
       instituted selectively by the LRS CC/AO or equivalent (T-3). These controls will include:
          5.7.11.5.1. Additional research to identify systems/operational deficiencies causing
          an inventory adjustment, high loss items and possible pilferage.
          5.7.11.5.2. Initiation of a report of survey.
          5.7.11.5.3. Disciplinary action as required.
          5.7.11.5.4. Establishment of studies and action items to correct deficiencies.
          5.7.11.5.5. Elevation of levels authorized to review, certify and approve inventory
          adjustments.
          5.7.11.5.6. Referral of systems problems to higher echelons with recommended
          solutions.
          5.7.11.5.7. Follow-on actions of analysis.

Section 5H—Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM)

5.8. Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM).
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                 161


  5.8.1. SPRAM assets are ERRCD code XD/XF items used by maintenance to perform
  functions such as detecting or isolating a fault, calibrating or aligning equipment, and
  duplicating an active system installed in an aircraft or on-line equipment. SPRAM includes
  items listed in the -21 TO’s and are used to conduct approved Air Education and Training
  Command (AETC) training courses.
     5.8.1.1. This section is applicable to AF activities providing or employing SPRAM.
     Note: The exclusion of -21 TO items in the SPRAM program is optional if the owning
     MAJCOM is using other methods to maintain accountability and visibility. The owning
     MAJCOM has to provide the central IM an annual update of asset position.
  5.8.2. SPRAM management. SPRAM assets are managed on detail records accounted for by
  LRS/Materiel Management Activity. This ensures additional SPRAM assets are procured if
  requirements exceed asset availability. Recoverable assets accounted for by a different
  method, such as supply points, do not require transfer to SPRAM details. SPRAM flag is a
  code used to identify the types of requirements authorized for retention of SPRAM assets.
  5.8.3. Responsibilities.
     5.8.3.1. MAJCOMs.
         5.8.3.1.1. All SPRAM requirements will be forwarded to MAJCOM headquarters for
         submission to the Program Manager (PM) or designated to the Product Support
         Manager (PSM). Data will include the stock number, quantity, end item supported,
         (i.e. C-17) and justification and a statement of funding availability (funded or
         unfunded). MAJCOMs will forward requests to the PSM for final approval with a
         statement of unit/MAJCOM funding availability for the requested items. The lead
         MAJCOM that owns the AOR for an AEF deployment location is responsible for
         budgeting and funding (3400 O&M) for steady state common use requirements.
         Examples of common use requirements shared by all deployed units are SPRAM test
         stations and sampling analyzers. Once MAJCOM receives PSM approval with
         supporting documentation, the MAJCOM will forward a copy of approval
         documentation and notify the supported activity to requisition the asset. (T-2).
         5.8.3.1.2. SPRAM Requirements for aircraft maintenance/Cost per Flying Hour
         (CPFH) programs, replacement, replenishment will be funded by the appropriate
         Funds Holder. The Centralized Asset Management (CAM) office is the Funds Holder
         for most active duty CPFH programs (excludes Air Mobility Command (AMC)
         strategic airlift and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC). The Air
         National Guard, Air Force Reserve Command, AFSOC and AMC (C-5 and C-17) are
         responsible for their individual SPRAM/Flying Programs. All other (i.e., non-flying
         hour) replacement/replenishment SPRAM requirements will be paid for by the
         owning MAJCOM or using organization. MSD charges Exchange Price if a carcass is
         returned, otherwise the Standard Price will be charged.
         5.8.3.1.3. Exceptions.
             5.8.3.1.3.1. XF3 items are not on SPRAM details unless MAJCOM or a higher
             authority so directs for a specific program.
             5.8.3.1.3.2. Recoverable assets accounted for by a different method, such as
162                                                             AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


             supply point, do not require transfer to SPRAM details.
             5.8.3.1.3.3. SPRAM assets may satisfy MICAP requirements. However, SPRAM
             requirements will not be misused as a means to routinely fill MICAP
             requirements.
      5.8.3.2. AFMC will: (T-2).
         5.8.3.2.1. Identify/select SPRAM items during the provisioning process.
         5.8.3.2.2. Provide MAJCOMs SPRAM requirements identified during initial
         provisioning
         5.8.3.2.3. Consider SPRAM requirements in buy computations. PM/EAIM approval
         is required for SPRAM authorizations.
      5.8.3.3. Group Commander or equivalent within the scope of specified responsibilities
      and authority:
         5.8.3.3.1. Reviews and certifies as the approval authority, all requests for SPRAM
         authorizations submitted by SPRAM custodians.
         5.8.3.3.2. Ensures all SPRAM assets are properly maintained and safeguarded. Note:
         These actions may be delegated by the Group/CC to the Squadron Commander.
         Delegation below that level is not authorized.
      5.8.3.4. Organization Commander.
         5.8.3.4.1. Ensures all mission-essential SPRAM assets are on-hand or on-order to
         support the assigned or programmed functions and unit mission. Annually, certifies
         by signing the SPRAM listing all authorizations are current and necessary for mission
         support. This will be done in conjunction with the annual inventory or upon
         assumption of the account. (T-3).
         5.8.3.4.2. Appoints capable individuals as SPRAM custodians and alternates,
         including establishment, change, or cancellation of SPRAM accounts. Custodians
         may be commissioned officers, noncommissioned officers, civilians or contractors (as
         specified in contract), and must be mutually agreed upon by the organization
         commander and the LRS/CC. This applies to active duty AF and Reserve personnel.
         Foreign nationals or local wage rate employees (foreign nationals in host countries)
         may be appointed as primary or alternate SPRAM custodians only when they may be
         held pecuniary liable under the laws of the host country. A new primary custodian or
         alternate is appointed when both the primary and alternate custodian will be absent
         simultaneously for 45 or more calendar days, or when either custodian is reassigned
         or separated. (T-3).
             5.8.3.4.2.1. Ensures primary and alternate SPRAM custodians, not previously
             trained, attend block training courses provided by the LRS CC/AO.
             5.8.3.4.2.2. Ensures primary and alternate SPRAM custodians receive within
             every 2 years refresher block training courses provided by the LRS CC/AO.
             5.8.3.4.2.3. Ensures qualified individuals are preselected as SPRAM custodians
             on all unit deployments. Individuals will be identified to the host LRS CC/AO to
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       163


           receive training regarding management of SPRAM assets during deployment. (T-
           3).
           5.8.3.4.2.4. Ensures personnel are aware of policies and guidelines established in
           AFI 23-111 and AFI 20-110.
           5.8.3.4.2.5. (DELETED)
     5.8.3.5. Primary and Alternate SPRAM Custodian.
        5.8.3.5.1. Upon assignment and every two years thereafter as a custodian, attend
        training on responsibilities, current policies, and procedures with EAE.
        5.8.3.5.2. Performs initial, annual and periodic inventories of SPRAM assets.
           5.8.3.5.2.1. Periodic inventories and validations occur when there is a change of
           primary custodian, when requested by the Organization Commander or higher
           authority, or when directed by MAJCOM.
           5.8.3.5.2.2. Ensures that all items are on-hand and serviceable.
           5.8.3.5.2.3. Validate SPRAM authorizations and backorders. Turn-in excess and
           request cancellation of unneeded backorders and requisitions.
        5.8.3.5.3. Concurrent with annual inventory, specifically determine whether the
        original justification is still valid and annotate the annual validation accordingly. If a
        change in mission and/or number of end items supported has occurred since the last
        validation, custodians must provide rationale if there is no corresponding change in
        authorizations.
           5.8.3.5.3.1. Provides SPRAM listing to organizational commander for their
           certification and signature that authorizations are current and necessary for
           mission support.
           5.8.3.5.3.2. Maintain justification documentation for all SPRAM authorizations
           until the authorization is deleted.
           5.8.3.5.3.3. Reports at once, any incorrect authorizations and excess on-hand
           assets to the EAE.
        5.8.3.5.4. Verifies the SPRAM listing received from the EAE to ensure data are
        complete and accurate. Signs and returns the SPRAM listing to EAE within 15
        workdays from the production date on the SPRAM listing (off-base organizations are
        allowed 30 workdays).
        5.8.3.5.5. Furnishes all information and documentation required to change SPRAM
        records to be relieved from accountability or responsibility for items lost or
        destroyed.
        5.8.3.5.6. Makes sure the custody account has been properly transferred to the new
        custodian when responsibility ends, and the custodian is cleared by EAE.
        5.8.3.5.7. Provides justification to EAE citing supporting documentation when
        requesting new or increased SPRAM authorizations. Supporting documentation
        includes TO references, maintenance directives, correspondence, etc. PM/EAIM
 164                                                             AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


          approval is required for SPRAM authorizations. Also, the EAIM may challenge
          requests for suspect excess quantities.
              5.8.3.5.7.1. The methodology for computing the SPRAM quantity will be
              included in the justification. For example, a maintenance directive states a
              quantity of two SPRAM assets are required per aircraft and 24 aircraft are
              assigned to the organization. The SPRAM quantity authorized under this
              justification would be 48 each.
          5.8.3.5.8. Performs a due-out validation with the EAE in the LRS/Materiel
          Management Activity.
          5.8.3.5.9. Establishes an accounting method or system that allows immediate
          identification of SPRAM assets stored or used outside the custodian's workcenter.
          This may be done by using hand receipts (AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt),
          logs, letters, charts, etc. and is normally documented in a local MOI.
          5.8.3.5.10. Provide EAE a listing of all SPRAM assets to be transferred or deployed
          indicating the duration, location, and any special actions required. The custodian
          determines if any requirements on order at the time of transfer action will remain on-
          order or be cancelled.
       5.8.3.6. The EAE or equivalent is responsible for SPRAM processes. EAEs will (T-3).
          5.8.3.6.1. Report SPRAM authorizations and balances in the appropriate IT system.
          This data is reported as changes occur to SPRAM asset levels or when other changes
          occur to the applicable NSN.
          5.8.3.6.2. Maintain a copy of each letter requesting changes to SPRAM
          authorizations in a folder along with the current SPRAM listing and the custodian
          appointment letter. Letters may be destroyed when a new SPRAM listing signed by
          the SPRAM custodian is received.
          5.8.3.6.3. Review all SPRAM authorizations annually and certify them as valid.
          Certification may occur during the annual SPRAM inventory and may be noted on
          the approved SPRAM listing.
          5.8.3.6.4. Maintain SPRAM Custodian Files.
          5.8.3.6.5. Review justification for SPRAM authorizations concurrent with the annual
          inventory.
              5.8.3.6.5.1. Specifically determine whether the original justifications are still
              valid and validate annually.
              5.8.3.6.5.2. Delete invalid SPRAM authorizations, turn in excesses and cancel
              unneeded requisitions.
              5.8.3.6.5.3. Maintain justification documentation for all SPRAM authorizations
              until the authorization is deleted.

      AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5C, Physical Asset Management. (T-2).
      5.9.9.2. Shelf Life Coded Items. Shelf life codes are established in the retail materiel
      management system to identify the number of months new items may remain unused in
      storage before they must be reconditioned or condemned. Note: The shelf life code does
      not identify the shelf life remaining on any particular unit(s) of on-hand stock. Shelf Life
      coded items are managed and stored IAW the policies contained in DoD 4140.27-M.
         5.9.9.2.1. Controlling Items in Storage. To control items in storage, Inspection
         personnel will at least quarterly process a listing of the item records for all items
         assigned shelf life codes. Refer to AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5C, Physical Asset
         Management for shelf life procedures. (T-2).
      5.9.9.3. For guidance on TCTOs refer to Sec. 4B, TCTO of this instruction.
      5.9.9.4. Identification of Discrepant Material. To ensure the right items are identified as
      unsuitable for AF use. Inspection personnel will notify base customers via daily bulletins,
      newsletters or phone calls as a means of notification. The basis for notification depends
      upon the type of item, i.e. messages concerning items peculiar to one organization will
      not be published in daily bulletins or newsletters. (T-2).
         5.9.9.4.1. Suspect Materiel Flag. Upon notification and subsequent identification of
         an unsuitable item, Inspection personnel will process a stock control data load input;
         see AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5C, Physical Asset Management, for processing
         information. The length of time an item will be coded as suspect materiel will be
         published in the applicable directives. If not, the code will remain on the item record
         for one year. (T-2).
             5.9.9.4.1.1. When suspect materiel is received or turned-in, Inspection personnel
             will determine if the materiel is unsuitable or not and dispose of unsuitable items
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     169


            according to the disposition instructions provided in the applicable directive. They
            return suitable items to a serviceable condition IAW AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5C,
            Physical Asset Management. If disposition instructions must be obtained, the
            inspector notes the corrective actions to be taken and signs/stamps and routes the
            management notice IAW AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5C, Physical Asset Management.
            (T-2).
        5.9.9.4.2. Disposition. Remove on-hand unsuitable items from storage locations and
        dispose of them according to the disposition instructions furnished in the applicable
        directive. When disposition instructions have not been provided, process a stock
        control data load input to change the condition of the assets to supply condition code
        J. This will suspend the items on an unserviceable detail until disposition instructions
        can be obtained.
        5.9.9.4.3. Materiel Suspect Code Listing. Each month Inspection personnel must
        request a utility program to list all stock numbers having materiel suspect codes
        assigned to them. (T-2). Inspection forwards one copy of the listing to Distribution
        Flight and another copy to Flight Service Center, who in-turn uses them during
        Degraded Operations. Inspection personnel maintain a working copy until a new
        monthly listing is printed.
     5.9.9.5. Supply Discrepancy Report. The Report of Discrepancy (ROD)/Supply
     Discrepancy Report, SF 364, is filed by receiving activities to record item or packaging
     discrepancies attributable to the shipping activity see DLM 4000.25, Vol 2, Ch 17 .
     SDRs are prepared for non-receipt of lost or misplaced requisitions (shipments) after
     Cargo Movement or equivalent confirms non-receipt of lost or misplaced requisitions
     (shipments). Use the Enterprise Solution-Supply (ES-S) SDR function or the DoD Web-
     SDR system as the primary means to submit SDRs and SF 364 when the ES-S SDR
     function or the DoD Web-SDR system is not available. Corrective action will be taken
     depending on the source/nature of any discrepancy, and will involve proper identification
     and condition of materiel. Any subsequent action taken will be determined only by
     qualified and authorized inspectors.
     5.9.9.6. Warranty/Guaranty Items. Items under warranty/guaranty require special
     handling. Inspection personnel will ensure the following procedures are adhered to: (T-
     2).
        5.9.9.6.1. Routing of Warranties. Copies of warranties will be attached to property
        and routed to the activity responsible for maintaining the warranty. (T-2).
        5.9.9.6.2. Inspection must coordinate with base maintenance activities and with
        contract repair services to ensure warranty/guaranty data are properly routed. Exact
        procedures and checklists to ensure warranties/guaranties are fully utilized will be
        locally developed. Generally, Inspection forwards a copy of the annotated receiving
        document and the applicable warranty to the appropriate activity or office listed
        below: (T-2).
            5.9.9.6.2.1. The Base Civil Engineer for items that Civil Engineering maintains
            or repairs.
            5.9.9.6.2.2. Vehicle Management Flight for new motor vehicles according to AFI
170                                                                AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


             24-302 and TO 36-1-191, Technical and Manual Reference for Motor Vehicles.
             5.9.9.6.2.3. Other maintenance offices as appropriate. Processing of centrally
             managed or procured items under warranty as described in AFMAN 23-122, Sec.
             6B, Returns.
             5.9.9.6.2.4. Other activities maintaining warranty/guaranty and serialized control
             item data. This action will be accomplished as specified by MAJCOM rules. (T-
             2).
         5.9.9.6.3. Warranted or Guaranteed Items Requiring Repair. Normally, organizations
         will process warranted or guaranteed items requiring repair directly to Contract
         Maintenance. For exceptions to this guidance, either the AFMC IM or the ICP will
         provide instructions for processing the item or FSC involved. (T-2).
         5.9.9.6.4. Supply Inspectors normally manage the functional check program for the
         LRS/AO. At the option of the LRS CC/AO or the MAJCOM, the functional check
         program for RSPs may be managed separately. The LRS CC/AO and the AMXS and
         MXS/CC of Maintenance will jointly agree on an individual to act as the
         Maintenance contact point. (T-3).
      5.9.9.7. Items in MRSPs. If the MAJCOM or LRS CC/AO has not directed otherwise,
      War reserve will review dated items in MRSP using the Shelf Life Control Listing. The
      MAJCOM or local management may direct Inspection personnel to perform this task
      using the Shelf Life Control Listing provided by the MRSP monitor.
      5.9.9.8. Processing Condemned Items. Condemned items will be processed according to
      AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5I, Inspection and Related Operations. (T-2).
      5.9.9.9. Special Storage, Handling, and Inspection Requirements. There are numerous
      categories of items and circumstances where alternate or additional procedures for
      storage, handling, and inspection are required. Examples include: Controlled items,
      items requiring functional check prior to issue, hazardous commodities, shelf-life control,
      assets pending modification, and items that may have a warranty/guaranty associated
      with them. See AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 5C Physical Asset Management for detailed
      procedures required to manage assets that require special storage, handling, and
      inspection requirements.
      5.9.9.10. Special Inspection Requirements.
         5.9.9.10.1. Inspection Offline Checklist. Inspection personnel maintain a file/list of
         items unsuitable for AF use (suspect materiel), functional checks, and TCTOs that are
         not loaded during the initial screening. Items must remain in the file/list at least 1 year
         or sooner if the situation or condition affecting the item has been resolved or
         rescinded.
         5.9.9.10.2. At least monthly, Inspection personnel will use a local management
         program to determine if any items have been subsequently loaded. When any of the
         items in the file/list are loaded, Inspection must then take the action required by the
         appropriate directives and ensure the correct codes are loaded.
      5.9.9.11. Tagging Requirements for Materiel Directly Affected by TCTO.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                        171


          5.9.9.11.1. Applicable to the AFMC Air Logistics Complexes.
              5.9.9.11.1.1. Materiel spares in stock with outstanding TCTO requirements will
              be tagged TO compliance (TOC), condition code "D" with a DD Form
              1576/1576-1, Test Modification Tag - Materiel upon receipt of the TCTO except
              when the TCTO will change the item's form/fit/function (change in NSN and part
              number), or when specific serial number controlled items are affected. In the case
              of serial number controlled items, only the serial numbers identified will be
              tagged TOC.
              5.9.9.11.1.2. There are instances when only a portion of the existing stock may
              require TOC action. However, all units in stock will be tagged TOC upon receipt
              of the TCTO. The IM will treat these items as management review items.
              5.9.9.11.1.3. When serviceable materiel with no outstanding TCTOs is turned in
              from organizational/intermediate or depot level maintenance to supply, the
              serviceable tag/label (DD Form 1574/1574-1) will be annotated with the
              following phrase in the remarks block: "The following TCTOs have been
              complied with: (list all TCTO numbers in the remarks block and/or on the back of
              the tag)." The annotation is not required whenever the item being returned has
              undergone TOC action involving modification and resulted in a change in NSN or
              part number. Material being turned in to supply with an outstanding TCTO(s) will
              be tagged with a DD Form 1576/1576-1 tag or label as condition code "D"
              (TOC), and the phrase "TCTO (numbers(s)) not complied with" will be annotated
              in the remarks block.
              5.9.9.11.1.4. Material in a condition other than serviceable will not require
              tagging as TOC. The maintenance activity will determine outstanding TCTO
              requirements at the time of repair.
          5.9.9.11.2. Applicable to AF bases. Items requiring modifications which change their
          form, fit, or function will be assigned NPPC 4 or TCTO flag with DD Form
          1576/1576-1.

Section 5K—Stock Positioning

5.11. Stock Positioning.
   5.11.1. Stock positioning decisions will optimize the storage and movement of materiel to
   meet worldwide customer mission requirements. Stock positioning decisions will be based
   primarily on achieving responsive and efficient materiel distribution support.
176                                                                AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


  5.11.2. AF stock positioning policies will comply with requirements in DoD 4140.1-R;
  DLM 4000.25-M; DLM 4000.25-1-M; DLM 4000.25-2-M, Military Standard Transaction
  Reporting And Accounting Procedures (MILSTRAP); DoD 4140.26-M; Joint Regulation
  AMC-R 700-99/NAVSUPINST 4790.7/AFMCR 400-21/MCOP4410.22C; AFPD 23-1; AFI
  20-110; and AFJMAN 23-210.
  5.11.3. Automatic Sourcing. Automatic Sourcing will enable a capability to: 1) automate
  lateral (base to base) support for high priority orders (HPOs) and; 2) automatically
  redistribute excess (BC 9 only) assets.
      5.11.3.1. The Automatic Lateral Support function supports MICAP, AWP, JCS, and/or
      FSL requirements.
      5.11.3.2. The Excess Redistribution function automatically screens outgoing lower
      priority requisitions for budget code 9 assets to determine if redistributable excess assets
      are available at other materiel management IT system accounts before forwarding the
      requisition to the normal source of supply.
      5.11.3.3. The Air Force’s policy is to laterally distribute serviceable assets from the
      location that has the least need for the requested item in order to minimize subsequent re-
      supply actions (by the shipping location) and to ensure that any subsequent re-supply
      actions (requisitions) will not have a higher priority than the requisition being released.
      The overall distribution sequence is described in Enterprise Solution-Supply (ESS)
      manual.
  5.11.4. Roles and responsibilities.
      5.11.4.1. Delegation of Authority. Reference Para 1.1.2.2.

         owned IPE IAW DLAM 4215.1.
         5.11.4.2.4. Position assets close to users resulting in improved responsiveness, better
         support of peace and wartime requirements and reduced distribution costs. This
         guidance is applicable to all wholesale secondary items stocked by the AF, except
         war reserves and stocks designated for specific projects. The impact on inventory
         levels and the associated costs are an important part of the determination process.
         5.11.4.2.5. Restrict single point stockage of items to those that are supported by cost
         and benefit analysis.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     177

             annual retention computation.
             5.12.1.2.5.7. Justify in writing equipment retention additive requirements to a
             subgroup master stock number in the requirements data system and review
             retention additives to ensure they are deleted once they serve their legitimate
             purpose.
  5.12.2. Reclamation.
      5.12.2.1. The Department of Defense (DoD) Reclamation Program is prescribed by DoD
      4140.1-R and implemented by DoD 4160.21-M, Chapter 13, Reclamation.
      5.12.2.2. The authority for reclamation of aircraft is AFI 16-402. Disposal of aircraft will
      not take place until AF reclamation requirements are met. Failure to do so will result in
      potential loss of parts. The PM must consider transferring assets to AFMC Aerospace
      Maintenance and Regeneration Activity for reclamation when non-programmed
      requirements cannot be met on-site. Non-programmed reclamation must be planned prior
      to requesting save lists. (T-2).
      5.12.2.3. AFI 20-115, specifies the authority for retention of aircraft engines.
      5.12.2.4. Reclamation processes in this section primarily support AF-managed assets.
      PM/SSM/EIM organizations supporting CLS weapon system support programs must
      comply with the intent of DoD reclamation requirements and design CLS reclamation
      processes accordingly.
      5.12.2.5. Reclamations will be based upon the following criteria:
         5.12.2.5.1. A justifiable requirement exists.
         5.12.2.5.2. Removal must be economical. If it is not economical, the requirement will
         be based on an extreme urgency or lack of any other known supply sources.
         5.12.2.5.3. Based-funded items required locally may be reclaimed by retail activities
         when the parts can be economically removed and restored to a serviceable condition
         by the reclaiming activity.
         5.12.2.5.4. Resources must be available for the timely repair of reclaimed
         unserviceable items.
      5.12.2.6. Reclaimed items must be returned to proper materiel management activities and
      maintained on accountable records.
      5.12.2.7. Priority reclamation of DLA items must be initiated by DLA or a DLA
      designated SOS representative.
      5.12.2.8. Aircraft that crashed before 19 November 1961, and that remain wholly or
      partially unrecovered, are considered formally abandoned. The AF neither maintains title
      to, nor has property interest in, these aircraft.
         5.12.2.8.1. The authority for access to, and recovery of, these aircraft, as well as
         liability for damages associated with their recovery, are matters to be resolved
         between persons seeking recovery and landowners of the wreckage sites.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                        179


           5.12.2.8.2. If any human remains are discovered at the site, recovery personnel
           should immediately contact the nearest United States Embassy or United States
           military installation. To assist in proper identification of remains, recovery personnel
           should refrain from further operations at the site pending removal of the remains by
           United States experts.
       5.12.2.9. Programmed/non-programmed disposal freeze requests may be generated by
       HAF, AFMC, or as a result of a request from an AFMC Air Logistics Complex or ICP.
   5.12.3. Review of Potential Reutilization (Excess) Wholesale Stock Prior to Approval for
   Disposal. All potential reutilization (excess) items must be reviewed prior to disposal to
   ensure that no known or projected requirements exist.
       5.12.3.1. This review will include exploring possible needs due to NHA application,
       possible modification to a usable configuration, uses for other than its intended purpose
       and reclamation of component parts.
5.12.3.2. This review may result in the retention of computed excess assets.

           6.1.1.2.1. Process all retail level return requests through the FSC.
           6.1.1.2.2. Coordinate with maintenance to identify components for which there is
           base level repair capability as well as no base level repair capability and update repair
           cycle records. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity will review this information
           at least semiannually.
           6.1.1.2.3. Recover consumable useable material defined by DoD 4160.21-M.
           6.1.1.2.4. Establishment of on-base and off-base pick up points for return of
           consumable materiel.
           6.1.1.2.5. Establish agreements with the servicing DLADS that ensure cooperation,
           support, and assistance.

               correctly accounted for on supply system due-in from maintenance or in-use
               equipment detail records are commonly referred to as found on base (FOB). AFI
               23-111 requires the prompt recording of all property found on an installation not
               maintained in an account table system. FOB property will be processed by the
               Flight Service Center. FOB items will be thoroughly researched before being
               ADDED to the accountable record. Controlled items will not be processed as
               FOB. Controlled items will use Special Inventory guidance to clear FOB
               conditions; an ROS will be required to add such items to the accountable record.
               (T-2). See AFMAN 23-122, Table 6.2 for exceptions.
      6.1.1.3. Customers in possession of assets will comply with following guidance prior to
      returning property to the LRS/Materiel Management Activity to ensure proper
      identification, condition and complete documentation (i.e. forms, tags, reports, etc.):

   6.3.1. Disposal Guidance.
      6.3.1.1. DoD 4160.21-M and DoD 4160.28-M, implements the requirements of the
      Federal Property Management Regulation (FPMR), as it applies to the disposition of
      excess and surplus materiel.
      6.3.1.2. Disposal of serviceable items required to support and maintain an active weapon
      system or end item is prohibited.
      6.3.1.3. Primary Inventory Control Authority (PICA) and Secondary Inventory Control
      Activity (SICA). PICAs have final disposition authority for assets under their
      management. Therefore, SICAs will not dispose of items until they receive written
      authorization from the appropriate PICAs. PICAs will provide SICAs the current "ship
      to" information for reparable materiel.
      6.3.1.4. Retail activities will transfer centrally procured secondary and principal items to
      disposal only when directed by the IM, unless identified as authorized for immediate
      transfer to disposal. Component materiel identified by an IM for possible disposal but
      with potential for reutilization will be transferred to DLADS, unless new information
      justifies retention.
      6.3.1.5. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity may locally-direct transfers to DLADS
      when: serviceable/unserviceable items are no longer required; the items do not support an
      active weapon system or end item; and all disposal authority criteria has been met.
      6.3.1.6. The LRS/Materiel Management Activity will ensure all of the following disposal
      criteria are met before local disposal action is taken:
          6.3.1.6.1. For consumable items (BC 9) with demands, the disposal criteria is based
          upon the economic retention level (ERL). Any quantity above the ERL may be
          disposed of by transferring to DLADS.
          6.3.1.6.2. For consumable items without demands, the disposal criteria for BC 8
          (XB3, XF3) and BC 9 (XB3, XF3, and NF1) is authorized after 365 days for items
          with a MIC 3, 4, or blank. These criteria are based upon the date the Stockage Priority
184                                                               AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


         Code (SPC) is assigned. Conversely, MIC 1 and 2 assets may be disposed of after 730
         days from the date the SPC is assigned. This only applies to items containing a date
         SPC 5.
      6.3.1.7. Base-level organizations will transfer materiel to DLADS for items not
      processed through the applicable materiel management IT system. This includes the
      transfer of scrap and GPC purchased items.
         6.3.1.7.1. Segregation of scrap materiel is necessary to minimize DLADS handling
         costs and to ensure maximum return from the sale of disposed materiel. Segregation
         of scrap materiel will be accomplished by base organizations initiating materiel
         transfers to DLADS.
         6.3.1.7.2. When items are coded disposal, disposing organizations’ items must be
         turned into DLADS and/or demilitarized prior to transfer IAW the demil code
         assigned, DoD 4160.21-M, DoD 4160.28-M, and AFMAN 23-122, Sec. 6C,

     4160.21-M. (T-0).
        6.3.3.2.1. Using activities will maintain a file for accountability for silver recovery
        equipment and supplies provided by DLADS at no cost, kind of precious metals scrap
        generated, and the kind of fine precious metals and high precious metals content
        items used.
        6.3.3.2.2. Contractor activities operating on an AF installation where precious metals
        are used or recovery is involved, must ensure that the PMRP is addressed in the
        Performance Work Statement (PWS) or equivalent. (T-2).
 186                                                              AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013

                             SUPPORTING TECHNOLOGIES

Section 7A—Overview

7.1. Overview. This chapter also establishes policy on the administration and use of the
Integrated Logistics System – Supply (ILS-S). The policy described in this section is applicable
to all subsystems of the ILS-S (the Standard Base Supply System (SBSS), Enterprise Solution-
Supply (ES-S), and the AF Supply Central Database (AFSCDB).) except where explicitly
excluded. Specific procedures to create and maintain user accounts within each particular
subsystem of ILS-S are addressed in AFH 23-123.

Section 7B—Automated Identification Technology (AIT) and MMHS and Other Capabilities

7.2. AIT, MMHS and Other Capabilities.
   7.2.1. Automated Identification Technology (AIT). A group of technologies to improve
   material identification and data collection. The implementation of AIT capability within the
   AF shall be done through the ELS initiative and IAW DoD 4140.1-R. (T-0). The adoption,
   acquisition and implementation of AIT capabilities shall be accomplished at the enterprise
   level unless AF/A4L has granted an exception to this guidance. Requests for exception to
   guidance shall be made in writing and coordinated with MAJCOM A4 and AF/A4LM. (T-1).
       7.2.1.1. Asset Marking and Tracking (AMT). AMT enables total asset management
       throughout the supply chain by ensuring the consistent marking and tracking of all assets.
       AMT automatically identifies and tracks high cost, high impact, and other critical
       individual components from acquisition through transportation, supply, maintenance, and
       disposal. This includes consumables and non-serialized assets along with selected assets
       as identified within the OSD-led Serialized Item Management (SIM) initiative. AMT
       shall use existing capabilities and policy, such as IUID, and Radio Frequency
       Identification (RFID).
   7.2.2. IUID is a key enabler for automatic data capture on key items. This allows for capture
   of accurate lifecycle data that can be aggregated and analyzed by planners, engineers, and
   logisticians to produce predictive maintenance strategies. IUID implementation will meet
   requirements in MIL STD-130, Identification Marking of U.S. Military Property, and DoDI
   8320.04.
       7.2.2.1. SAF/AQ. The SAF/AQ manages IUID implementation with the acquisition of
       new assets.
       7.2.2.2. AF/A4L. AF/A4L manages IUID implementation and sustainment for legacy
       items to include Class II, VII, and IX supply items.
       7.2.2.3. Radio Frequency Identification. Active RFID supports asset visibility and
       improved logistic business processes throughout the DoD logistics enterprise. The AF
       maintains an active RFID infrastructure IAW with DoD policy directives. This
       infrastructure primarily supports distribution activities tracking shipments to, from and
       between OCONUS locations. The use of such automatic identification ensures minimal
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                187


     or no manual data entry, improves data accuracy and timeliness. The supporting AF
     RFID implementation plan encompasses both active and passive RFID technology in a
     cohesive environment to support the DoD vision will be IAW DoD and other applicable
     directives.
  7.2.3. MMHS Planning & Programming.
     7.2.3.1. Responsibilities:
        7.2.3.1.1. SAF/AQ. The SAF/AQ manages the budgeting and execution processes
        and issues the program authority for all MMHS/Storage Aids Systems (SAS) projects.
        7.2.3.1.2. AF/A4L. AF/A4L manages IUID implementation and sustainment for
        legacy items to include Class VII, IX and II supply items.
        7.2.3.1.3. MAJCOM Level. The MAJCOM appoints a MAJCOM Program Manager
        to manage the MMHS/SAS program and assigns a MAJCOM Focal Point to each
        funded requirement within that command. The MAJCOM Program Manager is
        responsible for assembling and prioritizing MMHS/SAS requirements and submitting
        this list, with Concept Papers for each requirement, annually to AFMC for funding.
        The MAJCOM Program Manager also advises AFMC of Military Construction
        (MILCON) projects (e.g. new warehouses and air freight terminals) that may require
        MMHS/SAS.
        7.2.3.1.4. AFMC. AFMC through the AF Mechanized Materials Handling
        Engineering Office monitors planning and programming processes for all
        MMHS/SAS projects.
            7.2.3.1.4.1. AFMC is the centralized AF program manager for all MMHS/SAS
            and the OPR for guidance pertaining to MMHS/SAS.
            7.2.3.1.4.2. AFMC must approve any proposed modification to an existing
            MMHS or SAS that originally required AFMC approval and was installed by
            AFMC. Modifications include changes to equipment, configuration, location,
            installation, functional changes and programmable controllers. If modifications
            exceed $100K, AFMC will fund them through the MMHS/SAS program.
            Modifications under $100K must be funded locally. (T-2).
            7.2.3.1.4.3. AFMC retains approval authority for configuration of all materiel
            management support facilities and air terminal facilities, based on the flow of
            materials and space utilization.
            7.2.3.1.4.4. AFMC prioritizes MAJCOM requirements into an AF MMHS/SAS
            Program. AFMC manages the program based on execution responsibilities,
            accounts for all projects submitted by MAJCOMs.
                7.2.3.1.4.4.1. MAJCOM focal points advocate to AFMC for each
                MAJCOM’s MMHS/SAS program ensuring all requirements are included in
                the AF Program. The MAJCOM focal point is the liaison between the
                MAJCOM Program Manager (PM) and the AFMC MMHS/SAS Program
                Manager.
            7.2.3.1.4.5. AFMC PE manages all technical aspects of a project. These include:
188                                                                 AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


             the initial evaluation of requirements, cost data, design (i.e. the preparation of
             drawings and specifications), contracting package, evaluation of technical
             proposals, and acceptance of installed equipment. If the MMHS/SAS project is
             associated with a MILCON project, the PE will attend all MILCON Design
             Conferences.
             7.2.3.1.4.6. AFMC coordinates funding, manages obligations and expenditures
             IAW AFI 65-601, and maintains financial management liaison with SAF/AQ and
             the AFMC PM.
         7.2.3.1.5. Base Level. The Base Project Officer (BPO) is designated by the using
         organization’s commander to be responsible for coordinating all on-site activities of a
         particular MMHS/SAS project. The BPO will be part of the using activity and be
         fully involved with project development.
      7.2.3.2. Guidance regarding MMHS usage. MMHS includes (but is not limited to)
      equipment, process controllers, or equipment shelters required to handle materials in a
      proven, systematic, mechanized manner. Note: MMHS does not include systems that
      require research and development. Systems must be either "off-the-shelf” or made from
      off-the-shelf components. MMHS also does not include: equipment which is item
      managed (unless included as part of a total system), general purpose forklifts, ISU
      containers, conventional pallet jacks, floor scrubbers, refrigerators, and freezers. If a
      system does not meet the above criteria, AFMC decides whether it qualifies under the
      MMHS program.
      7.2.3.3. Types of MMHS include:
         7.2.3.3.1. All types of conveyors, including 463L pallet conveyor.
         7.2.3.3.2. Narrow-aisle vehicles (guided by wire, radio, rail, light, or laser).
         7.2.3.3.3. Automated storage/retrieval systems (AS/RS), including elevating transfer
         vehicles (ETVs).
         7.2.3.3.4. Carousel storage systems (horizontal and vertical).
         7.2.3.3.5. Mobile storage systems.
         7.2.3.3.6. Cranes (bridge, trolley, jib, or gantry).
         7.2.3.3.7. Lifts (e.g. pallet build-up/breakdown lifts).
         7.2.3.3.8. Ball transfer mats.
         7.2.3.3.9. SAS.
         7.2.3.3.10. Dock levelers.
         7.2.3.3.11. Combinations of the above.
      7.2.3.4. Storage Aid Systems. SAS includes: mezzanines, modular cabinets, racks,
      shelving, and bins. It also includes any support equipment required to provide a
      completely functional storage system, or specialized function within a larger system.
      7.2.3.5. Identification of Requirement. The base identifies the need for the project and
      creates the Concept Paper for the MMHS/SAS project. The base submits the concept
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   189


     paper, which must be validated and updated annually, to the MAJCOM Program
     Manager until funded.
     7.2.3.6. Economic Analysis. When required by AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis, the
     base is responsible for ensuring an economic analysis is prepared by the installation
     financial analysis office.
     7.2.3.7. Local Infrastructure Improvements. Occasionally, local infrastructure
     improvements are required to support an MMHS/SAS project. These improvements (e.g.
     new transformer or fire pump) cannot be funded with MMHS/SAS funds and must
     therefore be funded through another source.
     7.2.3.8. Installation Planning. Installation planning and scheduling will be accomplished
     after completion of the system design and before contracting of the project. Where
     necessary, installation plans are built into the MMHS/SAS contract to ensure the
     equipment installation follows the predetermined plan. Installation plans include
     orientation of personnel in the concept of operation of the equipment and a plan for
     maintenance of the system. The base develops this plan with assistance from the PE.
     7.2.3.9. Contracting Package. After receiving the contracting package from the PE, the
     base coordinates the package with the appropriate local organizations. The base directs
     any comments or questions on the package to the PE, who modifies the contracting
     package as necessary.
     7.2.3.10. Contingency Plan. The base writes a contingency plan for the proposed system.
     Use of MMHS/SAS must consider enemy attack and power outages. There must be
     provisions for working around damaged or inoperable equipment and accessing material
     in support of the mission. The using organization commander approves the plan.
     7.2.3.11. Post Award Conference. The base attends the post award conference and assists
     the Contracting Officer and PE, as requested.
     7.2.3.12. Equipment Installation. The base monitors contractor performance during the
     installation of the equipment, reporting any problems to the PE.
     7.2.3.13. Equipment Accountability. The base shall maintain equipment accountability
     for MMHS/SAS under the applicable materiel management IT system and procedures.
     (T-3).
     7.2.3.14. Programming for MMHS.
        7.2.3.14.1. Programming Projects. In the second quarter of each fiscal year, AFMC
        will send a requirements call letter to each MAJCOM requesting an MMHS/SAS
        Priority List. (T-2).
        7.2.3.14.2. Project Design. Once an MMHS/SAS project is identified as funded, the
        AFMC PE begins the design process. MMHS/SAS projects are typically designed for
        existing (non-MILCON) facilities or newly constructed (MILCON) facilities.
        7.2.3.14.3. Non-MILCON Related MMHS/SAS. Design of a project includes
        collection and analysis of data, equipment selection, development of the layout, and
        preparation of the contracting package by AFMC. When the contracting package is
        complete, the PE sends it to the base for review and local coordination.
 190                                                             AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


          7.2.3.14.4. MMHS/SAS Associated with a MILCON Project. The process is the
          same for Non-MILCON related MMHS/SAS. However, the design process must start
          much sooner (as much as a year before funding), usually with the PE attending the
          initial MILCON conference (Concept Phase) at the site. The building will be
          designed around the operation/equipment; it is paramount that the PE determines the
          appropriate MMHS/SAS before the MILCON process gets underway.

Section 7E—Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S)

7.5. Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S).
   7.5.1. System Administration. The Supply community has the responsibility to administer
   the ILS-S system access and security program in accordance with the identification and
   authentication procedures outlined in this publication, AFMAN 33-282, Computer Security
   (COMPUSEC), ILS-S Program Management Office (PMO)-produced Rapid
   Communications Messages (RAPCOMs) and other security guides as applicable. All users
   are required to submit an automated System Authorization Access Request (SAAR). The
   DD Form 2875 may be used in situations where an automated submission method is not
   available or is prohibited by DISA. The level of approval required on the SAAR will be
   based on the user’s status (for example, type of user and location). Access will only be
   permitted for those functions required for mission accomplishment.
   7.5.2. Controlled Access. A high degree of control over the ILS-S system and data access
   to logistics data is warranted due to security and proprietary data issues. ILS-S has several
   security features that will lock user accounts and render the account inaccessible. Accounts
   will only be unlocked after positive identification is made in person with a CAC, an
   encrypted email or use of the Telephone Challenge Word. The authentication method is at
   the discretion of the ILS-S Administrator. Passwords will only be transmitted from the
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     193


  administrator to the user by means of encrypted email. ES-S access is granted through the
  Air Force Portal using CAC authentication. (T-2).
     7.5.2.1. Restrict Direct SBSS Access. Direct access to the SBSS is limited to users with
     a validated mission need for functions not supported in any other component of ILS-S.
     All requests for direct access to the SBSS made by personnel outside the AFMC SCM-R
     Computer Operations and AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity must be
     requested in writing and approved by HAF/A4LM. A signed copy of this authorization
     will be maintained with the SAAR and reviewed quarterly by the AFMC SCM-R
     Computer Operations Activity during validations. The coordination can be done by
     signed email. All requests will be reviewed and validated annually by HAF/A4LM to
     ensure direct SBSS access is still warranted. (T-1).
     7.5.2.2. Tiered Administration. ILS-S is based on a tiered administration concept that
     includes a hierarchy of system administrators. Higher level administrators manage lower
     level administrators and lower level administrators manage the users. Further details on
     the tiered administration concept can be found in the ES-S User’s Manual Chapter 29.
     7.5.2.3. Administrative and Transaction Groups.         ILS-S Administrative and
     Transaction Groups will be standardized across the enterprise. All changes will be
     requested in writing through the requestor’s MAJCOM to HAF/A4LM for approval. (T-
     1).
     7.5.2.4. Proprietary Information. Users assigned to Contractor Inventory Control
     Points (C-ICPs) will not be granted access to asset and order information from other C-
     ICPs. The Contractor’s Government Sponsor and the IAO responsible for each
     Administrative Group will ensure compliance to this restriction during quarterly system-
     generated validations. (T-2).
  7.5.3. Automated User Account Validation. The ILS-S Administrators will perform a
  validation of user accounts quarterly. The ILS-S Administrator will be notified by an alert or
  e-mail that a validation is required. (T-2).
  7.5.4. User Administration. Administrators serve as trusted agents to grant and maintain
  access rights to individual users in their units and Administrative Groups. Organizational
  commanders whose responsibilities include oversight of ILS-S operations will review and
  approve or disapprove the SAAR for all users requesting administrative privileges.
  Commanders, with approval from HAF/A4LM for direct access to the SBSS (discussed in
  7.5.2.1), will also appoint (through DISA) an Alternate IAO (AIAO) for controlling and
  monitoring SBSS unique security requirements. (T-1).
     7.5.4.1. Qualifications. Only USAF Military/Civilians or Support Contractors working
     under contract to the USAF can be appointed as ILS-S administrators (including AIAOs).
     C-ICP users will NOT be appointed as ILS-S administrators.
     7.5.4.2. Appointment. The AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity will
     determine the level and responsibility for administering accounts. (T-2).
     7.5.4.3. Responsibilities. Administrators are charged with approving, monitoring and
     updating user accounts when permissions change. They ensure the appropriate level of
     approval has been obtained before allowing access to and use of ILS-S applications.
194                                                                AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


      Administrators will also disable accounts immediately in any situation requiring
      additional research to validate the account. Administrators will immediately archive all
      accounts that are no longer required to perform the mission. (T-2).
         7.5.4.3.1. Understand DoD, DISA and Air Force Policy and Procedures. Do not
         rely solely on policy in the instruction. All administrators must also have a thorough
         understanding of all DoD , DISA and Air Force policy, manuals, handbooks and
         Security Technical Implementation Guides regarding system and user administration.
         (T-2).
         7.5.4.3.2. Manage System Access Authorization Requests (SAARs). Maintaining
         SAARs is mandatory and vital to passing system security audits. Failure to pass a
         system security audit will result in a re-audit within 90 days and may result in
         removal as a User Administrator. (T-1). SAARs maintained outside ILS-S must be
         centrally located to enable rapid retrieval, validation and access by auditors. SAARs
         contain a user’s personal data and should only be accessed by those in a “need to
         know" position.
         7.5.4.3.3. Perform Information Owner Duties. The Information Owner (IO).
         capability will only be assigned to administrators charged with local IO duties by the
         accountable officer. The IO will review all user requests and forward to the IAO for
         approval/disapproval. The IO must verify the SAAR contains only the minimum
         privileges required to perform the mission. (T-1).
         7.5.4.3.4. Perform Information Assurance Officer Duties. ILS-S IAOs are only
         located at the AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations and AFMC SCM-R Information
         Technology Activity. The IAO will review and approve or disapprove all user
         requests. The IAO must verify the SAAR contains only the privileges required to
         perform the mission. Extra scrutiny will take place at this level since the IAO is the
         last person in the approval chain prior to account creation and privileges being
         granted. Administrators will not update a data element the user has the capability to
         update in their profile. All requests to alter permissions in ILS-S will be documented
         using the automated SAAR. Under no circumstances will an administrator restore or
         reactivate an account when it is clear the user failed to fulfill their responsibilities or
         to avoid proper approval and validation by the supervisor, IO or IAO. (T-2).
         7.5.4.3.5. Limit SRAN Access. Administrators will not grant access to multiple
         accounts when a user’s job requires access to a single SRAN. Users may be granted
         privileges for multiple SRANs if there is a genuine need to access multiple accounts.
         The IO and IAO will make specific comments justifying the need for access to
         multiple SRANs on the SAAR to document this exception to policy. All access for
         base-level users will be reviewed by IO. The IAO assigned to the Admin Group will
         approve or disapprove all requests regardless of the source of the request. (T-2).
         7.5.4.3.6. Validate User Accounts. Administrators will complete the ILS-S
         automated validation NLT the user’s validation due date to prevent the user’s account
         from being automatically disabled by the system. During the review, Administrators
         must review the user’s history to detect adverse trends such as previously denied
         access requests, erroneously assigned privileges not aligned with the user’s role (such
         as assignment of multiple SRAN processing privileges for a base-level user),
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   195


        expiration dates longer than three years and base-level users with the “Get It” ,
        “Release Order” or similar capabilities. Validation of legacy accounts will ensure
        only those transactions not available in ES-S are assigned to those users approved by
        HAF/A4LM for SBSS access. (T-1).
           7.5.4.3.6.1. Bulk Load Not Authorized. The bulk uploading of validation data
           is not authorized without written approval of the AFMC SCM-R Information
           Technology Activity.
           7.5.4.3.6.2. Review Administrator Accounts. The AFMC SCM-R Information
           Technology Activity will validate all SPO and mid-level administrator accounts
           each quarter during the automated validation. The number of administrators will
           be maintained at the following ratios: 1 SPO-level admin per 1,500 users across
           the enterprise and 1 mid-level admin per 500 users across their Administrative
           Group. The mid-level administrator will validate low- level administrative
           accounts within their span of control during the automated validation. There will
           not be more than 2 low-level administrators per 100 users supported at a single
           location. Two low-level administrators are authorized when the number of
           supported users is less than 100 users at a single geographical location. SPO-level
           administrators will only be located in the ILS-S Program Office. With the
           exception of the NWRM Admin Group, mid-level administrators will only be
           located at the AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity.                      SBSS
           administrators will only be located at the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology
           Activity and AFMC SCM-R Computer Operations Activity. DISA account
           validation and audit procedures will be followed to ensure compliance and
           continued access. (T-2).
           7.5.4.3.6.3. Prevent Unauthorized Use. Administrators at all levels will
           implement proactive measures to ensure every user’s access and privileges are
           reviewed prior to a change in the user’s status. This includes, but is not limited
           to, transfer (PCS, PCA and new duty positions), retirement, administrative action,
           changes in employment status or extended absences. The administrator will
           ensure the user’s account expiration date is updated and will archive the user’s
           account(s) NLT 1 duty day prior to the user’s last day in that role. This action
           ensures the user will have to apply for access through the user’s new supervisor,
           IO and IAO at the gaining location to ensure the proper privileges are assigned.
           This will be accomplished using available technology and processes such as the
           vMPF in-processing/out-processing checklist functionality, contractor
           onboarding/departure procedures and locally-developed PCA checklists. (T-2).
           7.5.4.3.6.4. Scrutinize Deployment Accounts. Deployed users must apply for a
           new account upon arrival in the deployed location through the ILS-S automated
           SAAR if their duties require processing transactions against the deployed SRAN.
           The user, deployed supervisor, the IO and the IAO will ensure the account’s
           expiration date is set for the user’s re-deployment date. (T-2). Home station
           accounts will be subject to enterprise rules and long absences will result in the
           account being disabled and archived by ILS-S.
           7.5.4.3.6.5. Scrutinize Contractor Accounts. Contractors perform vital services
196                                                             AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


             for the Air Force. However, their access to ILS-S is contingent upon an approved
             and up to date contract authorizing their continued need for access.
             Administrators at all levels must ensure the expiration date on the contractor’s
             account is the last day of the current contract. Requests for changes to the
             expiration date must be requested using the ILS-S automated SAAR process and
             be approved by the Government Sponsor and ILS-S Administrators. Any account
             that expires due to the end of a contract requires submission of a new SAAR to
             ensure accurate recording of the company name, contract number and the
             continued approval of the government sponsor. (T-2).
             7.5.4.3.6.6. Scrutinize Multiple Accounts. There may be an operational need
             for an ILS-S user to have more than one account. This can occur for several
             reasons to include joint base processing with separate SBSS accounts within close
             proximity and supporting COOP operations. All requests for multiple accounts
             will contain a specific and detailed justification on the SAAR.
  7.5.5. Supervisor/US Government Sponsor Responsibilities. Supervisors will validate the
  need for access requested and endorse SAARs. A US Government Sponsor (normally the
  Contract QAE or Government PMO representative) must endorse (as the Supervisor) all ILS-
  S SAARs for contractor personnel. The organizational commander will serve as the
  supervisor for all administrator accounts. Supervisors are also responsible for the timely
  validation of their subordinates’ user accounts. This includes removing privileges during the
  validation process that are no longer required. It is the supervisor’s/US Government
  sponsor’s responsibility to notify the ILS-S Administrator NLT 3 duty days when a user no
  longer requires access to ILS-S. This notification can be by signed email, in-person or by
  telephone. (T-2).
  7.5.6. User Responsibilities. ILS-S users are responsible for their actions on the system.
  This includes the responsibility to protect the ILS-S account(s) and to prevent unauthorized
  access to the ILS-S.
      7.5.6.1. Protect Account Access. Account sharing is strictly prohibited. It is a security
      violation to leave a computer unlocked while a user away from the PC. Violators will
      have accounts archived by the administrator. The user will re-apply for access after re-
      accomplishing Information Assurance Training to reinforce security policy and
      procedures. Users will also contact the administrator immediately if they suspect their
      account has been compromised. (T-1).
      7.5.6.2. Request/Process Account Changes. Users will update changes to ILS-S profile
      immediately as a condition of continued access. The ILS-S Automated SAAR will be the
      only mechanism to request changes to a user’s SRANs, capabilities and transactions.
      Changes to an account not maintained by the automated SAAR require a new SAAR to
      be approved and routed to the IAO/AIAO. New requests and changes to existing
      accounts will be completed by the user NLT 3 duty days prior to the operational
      requirement to allow for proper routing. The user is also responsible for notifying the
      supervisor/US Government sponsor when ILS-S access or privileges to ILS-S are no
      longer required. (T-2).
      7.5.6.3. Review ILS-S System Messages. Users will regularly review all policy,
      procedures, RAPCOMs and the ILS-S SharePoint site to ensure proper use of the ILS-S.
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                   197


     (T-1). Failure to do so may result in the user’s account being disabled until appropriate
     training is completed to ensure compliance.
  7.5.7. Security Manager Responsibilities. The security manager with access to a user’s
  security clearance information will review the need for access and complete the Security
  Manager section of the SAAR. (T-1). This includes the determination to approve or
  disapprove the user’s access to ILS-S.
 198                                                              AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013

  8.2.4. The AF Form 86, Request for Cataloging Data/Action will be used by AF activities to
  request Federal Supply Catalog actions to the DLIS Cataloging Center. The primary method
  to submit a request for cataloging action is via the automated AF cataloging system.
  However, there will be instances where the system will not accept the request or the AF
  initiator does not have access to the system at their location. In this case, the hard copy AF
  Form 86 will be necessary. AF Forms 86 are used within the AF only and will not be
  submitted to other military services (Army, Navy, and Marines) or to a DoD integrated
  materiel manager.
      8.2.4.1. Submittal of cataloging actions by initiators will always be accompanied by
      Reference Number Category Code and Reference Number Variation Code.
      8.2.4.2. When cataloging actions are completed, the AF Form 86, indicating completed
      action will be returned to the initiator.
      8.2.4.3. Purpose and Nature Of Property Classification. The rules and principles
      concerning the FSC are contained in DoD 4100.39-M, Volume 4.
      8.2.4.4. Item Aggregation. In addition to the FSC as a means of item aggregation, the AF
      uses the Materiel Management Aggregation Code (MMAC). The AF logistics system
      requires all weapons systems and technology group related items be assigned a MMAC
      for the purpose of:
         8.2.4.4.1. Segregating property according to air and ground application, when not
         provided for by the FSC and required by supply management.
         8.2.4.4.2. Segregating items in specific classes for management purposes, where the
         FSC is too large or further relationship to an end item is required; such as 1560, 2840,
         FSG 14, etc.
         8.2.4.4.3. Items classified in FSCs 1560, 2810, 2840, 2845, 4935, 4960, and FSGs 14
         and 18 must have a MMAC assigned regardless of management assignment (i.e.
         DLA, AF, other service).
      8.2.4.5. Assignment of AF Control Numbers.
         8.2.4.5.1. Non-Cataloged (NC) Control Numbers:
             8.2.4.5.1.1. New item requests, also referred to as non-cataloged (NC) numbers
             are assigned a Standard Inter-service Agency Serial Control Number (SIASCN)
             constructed IAW DoD 4140.26-M-V6, Supply Support Requests (SSRs.
             8.2.4.5.1.2. The NC Control Number is used when a requirement exists for a new
             item to enter the supply system. This control number is assigned automatically by
             the AF system to control and monitor requests for NSN assignment.
             8.2.4.5.1.3. SIASCNs are assigned to all potential AF managed items of supply
             that require NSN assignment. SIASCNs are assigned by the responsible AFMC
             ICP, which is generally determined by the MMAC (i.e. weapon system mission
             assignment). Non-weapon system/non-MMAC NSNs (e.g., medical items-FSG 65
             and clothing- FSG 84 (except 8475)) will be determined by the FSC.
         8.2.4.5.2. Non-Definitive (ND) Control Numbers:
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       201


            8.2.4.5.2.1. Numbers are assigned by the AF system as a result of an AFMC ICP
            action to:
                8.2.4.5.2.1.1. Identify items not considered to be logical spares, on a one-time
                basis, for shipment of assets to support a part number requisition, or to show
                custody in support of an operational requirement.
                8.2.4.5.2.1.2. Establish controls within the AF system, on a temporary basis,
                for one-time buys of consumable (ERRC N), non-logical spares.
                8.2.4.5.2.1.3. Support special projects authorized by AFMC.
                8.2.4.5.2.1.4. Support non-standard one-time buy items in support of an FMS
                requirement.
            8.2.4.5.2.2. ND numbers are “temporary” control numbers used for
            accountability. They do not replace NSNs and the use of an ND number is not to
            exceed one year.
         8.2.4.5.3. Kits are assigned “K” numbers when established by AFMC.
         8.2.4.5.4. “P” numbers are assigned by bases for control of items having a true
         manufacturer’s part/reference number of 10 digits or less. If the part/reference
         number exceeds 10 digits or if more than one part/reference number exists for the
         same item of supply, a “P” serialized number will be used.
         8.2.4.5.5. “L” numbers are assigned by bases when a “P” number cannot be used.
         (i.e. items without a part/reference number). If a valid requirement exists for the
         assignment of an “L” control number, bases will not be required to submit an AF

           replenishes bench stock bins.
           9.2.5.3.2.3. Establish a formal document control system for internal use. This
           document will be maintained to clearly indicate those documents (requests for
           purchase, receipts, issues) pertaining to materiel procured by the base contracting
           activity and will be subject to audit. Subject files will be disposed of according to
           AFI 33-322, Records Management Program,.
           9.2.5.3.2.4. Receive requirements from organizations and submit them through
           the appropriate IT system.
           9.2.5.3.2.5. Provide the AO designated funds manager with the estimated sales
           values for supplies and equipment.
           9.2.5.3.2.6. May bypass the standard materiel management system for
           nonrecurring non-NSN supplies. If direct procurement is used, the sections must
           perform all necessary research and document preparation.
           9.2.5.3.2.7. Forward all equipment requirements requiring approval action to the

           storage areas are limited to RDT&E LMCA’s, specifically authorized by AFMC
           to retain items having an anticipated future usage. This guidance is applicable
           when the laboratories or centers are supported by either an AFMC base or are
           supported as a tenant of any other MAJCOM base.
           9.2.5.3.4.2. Authorization for Commercial Standard Items. The LMCA is
           authorized to procure commercial standard items instead of requisitioning NSN or
           military standard items. This authority covers those instances when the item
           locally procured is superior to the item available through normal supply either
           because it is better suited to RDT&E requirements or because it is significantly
           less expensive.
        9.2.5.3.5. Holding Areas.
           9.2.5.3.5.1. LMCAs are authorized to establish and maintain Temporary Storage
           Areas (TSA) and Intransit Property Areas.

      10.2.10.3. Out-of-Cycle Reconciliation. The office of primary responsibility for CCI,
      AFMC Cryptological System Activity may direct out-of-cycle reconciliation reports with
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                     225


     MAJCOM approval. When bases are directed to do these out-of-cycle reconciliations,
     transmission of data will be by the same method and to the same places as the scheduled
     annual reconciliation.
  10.2.11. Special Logistics Support for Special Access Required (SAR) Parts Program.
     10.2.11.1. Required when normal security methods cannot protect an activity from a
     known threat, special access controls safeguard operational and technological advantages
     from potential enemies by limiting access to information about, or observation of, certain
     weapons, weapon systems, techniques, and operations. The term Special Access Program
     (SAP), often substituted for "Special Access Required (SAR)", may describe the security
     control system, the entire effort, and in some cases certain budget information.
     10.2.11.2. SAPs must obtain approval to introduce the SAP into a Sensitive
     Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) from 497 IG/INS and also negotiate a
     security agreement with 497 IG/INS. Refer to AFPD 16-7, Special Access Programs and
     AFI 16-701, Special Access Programs.
     10.2.11.3. Access Requirements. The LRS CC/AO will ensure prior to activation of a
     special access program that personnel obtain proper clearances and are granted access by
     the program manager or their designated representative for receiving, handling, storing
     and issuing SAR materiel. For contracted supply activities the government must include
     in the Performance Work Statement the requirement for the contractor to have or hire
     individuals with the proper clearance for SAR processing. The LRS CC/AO will identify
     the number of individuals required to handle SAR material. Only in rare or unusual
     instances will office administration personnel be granted access to SAR information, and
     then only if there is a valid need-to-know. Convenience or efficiency is not legitimate
     need-to-know criteria.
         10.2.11.3.1. The LRS CC/AO will keep the number of personnel authorized to
         handle SAR materiel to an absolute minimum.
         10.2.11.3.2. After the individuals are granted the proper clearance and the storage
         area is inspected and certified, the program manager or their designated representative
         must “read” the cleared individuals into the program to allow the proper handling,
         storage and issue of SAR classified materiel.
         10.2.11.3.3. The LRS CC/AO will generate and keep current and authorized list of
         on base personnel authorized to receipt/handling for SAR materiel. This listing will
         be used to update the applicable materiel management system and confirm only
         authorized personnel receive SAR items.
  10.2.12. Item Unique Identification (IUID). Program.
     10.2.12.1. Overview. This section describes guidance for the capture and reporting of
     the Unique Item Identifier (UII) for IUID managed assets.
     10.2.12.2. The AF is required (as directed by the Department of Defense (DoD)) to
     capture and report the UII to the DoD IUID registry for all IUID managed assets. LRS
     personnel are required to scan/enter the UII(s) of IUID managed assets when prompted
     by the applicable ILS-S system. If UII is unavailable, submit transaction through the
     ILS-S system.
226                                                              AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013


      10.2.12.3. IUID managed assets are identified in the DoD and AF cataloging systems
      and include Class II, VII and IX supply items. These cataloging systems provide the
      IUID indicator to the applicable ILS-S system.
      10.2.12.4. The LRS CC/AO will assign a single point of contact (POC) for referral of
      inquiries regarding IUID managed assets.
         10.2.12.4.1. Responsibilities of the POC include researching the consolidated
         transaction history, delivery verification records and audit trail when necessary by the
         appointed IUID POC or LRS CC/AO.

policies and plans. That quantity shall be sufficient to support other U.S. Government Agencies,
as applicable.
Awaiting Parts—During the repair process for systems/equipment, parts are ordered for the
system/equipment undergoing repair or an end item is being scheduled for a repair process and
parts are ordered for a scheduled repair of the system/equipment to start the repair process. The
end item system/equipment undergoing repair/being scheduled for repair is AWP when the parts
to continue the repair process are backordered or the scheduled repair process will exceed
mission requirements.
Base Condemnation Rate—The number of base condemnations divided by the sum base Repair

and associated asset status of individual secondary items and generate summaries of essential
information. If a methodology other than stratification is used as a foundation, an audit trail to
the applicable stratification table shall be submitted to the USD(L&MR). Secondary item assets
shall be stratified at least semiannually. One stratification shall be as of September 30 (for
inventory reporting and funding reviews), and the other shall be as of March 31 (for budget
preparation).

to failure of the contractor to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract.
Controlled Inventory Item Code—Those items designated as having characteristics that
require that they be identified, accounted for, secured, segregated, or handled in a special manner
to ensure their safeguard or integrity.
Control Level—A computed stock level the inventory management specialist or materiel
management IT system uses when filling requisitions. Non-programmed requisitions may be
filled from depot stocks if the asset position is above the control level.
Coordination—The necessary action to ensure adequate exchange of information to integrate,
synchronize, and deconflict operations between separate organizations. Coordination is not
necessarily a process of gaining approval but is most often used for mutual exchange of
information.
Counterfeit Materiel—An item that is an unauthorized copy or substitute that has been
identified, marked, or altered by a source other than the item’s legally authorized source and has
been misrepresented to be an authorized item of the legally authorized source.
Critical Safety Item—Means a part, an assembly, installation equipment, launch equipment,
recovery equipment, or support equipment for an aircraft or aviation weapon system if the part,
assembly, or equipment contains a characteristic any failure, malfunction, or absence of which

aircraft or weapon system, an unacceptable risk of personal injury or loss of life, or an
uncommanded engine shutdown that jeopardizes safety.
Customer Oriented Leveling Technique—Used to centrally compute levels for DLA-managed
items that have an established demand pattern.
Daily Demand Frequency Rate—The DDFR reflects the average daily number of customer
requests for an item. The DDFR differs from DDR in that DDFR is based on the number of
customer orders (requests), while DDR is based the number of units of stock requested. DDFR is
calculated by dividing the sum of customer requests by the number of days since the item’s Date
of First Demand (DOFD).
Daily Demand Rate—Average quantity of an item that is used daily. The retail materiel
management system computes the DDR using one of the following methods: (1) Bachelor or
Substitute Item. Divide the item cumulative recurring demand (CRD) by the difference of the
current Julian date minus the DOFD. If the demand experience available is less than 180 days, a
difference of 180 mitigates the effect of limited demand experience. (2) Master or
Interchangeable Item. Divide the cumulative recurring demand (CRD) for the master and all
interchangeable items within the group (for one system designator at a time) by the difference of
the current Julian date minus the oldest date of first demand in the master/interchangeable group.
If the demand experience available is less than 180 days, a difference of 180 days mitigates the
effect of limited demand experience.
Data Dissemination—Various products and events provide logistics information to customers at
every level of the supply system.
 250                                                                 AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013

management structure to be excess to the needs of a DoD activity.
Demand—An indication of a requirement (requisition, request, issue, and reparable generation;
etc.) for issue of serviceable materiel. Demands are categorized as either "recurring" or "non-
recurring."
Demand Level—Stock level for a specific item that is based upon past user demands.
Demand-Support Items—Items that are stocked based on forecasted usage. Demand-supported

Demilitarization—Act of destroying the functional or military capabilities of certain types of
equipment or material that has been screened through inventory control points and declared
surplus or foreign excess. Items that are subject to demilitarization include defense articles on the
United States Munitions List, as provided by Section 38 of the "Arms Export Control Act" (22
CFR 121 (reference (aj))). Also included are items on the Commerce Control List of the
Department of Commerce (15 CFR 774 (reference (ak))), and items on the United States
Munitions Import List of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms of the Department of

level or that is designated for repair below the depot level, but if repair cannot be accomplished
at that level, shall have its unserviceable carcass is either forwarded to the depot for repair or
condemnation, or reported to the ICP for disposition.
Depot Stock Levels—Depot stock levels represent those levels that are required in support of
depot overhaul requirements. These are subdivided into two categories, job-routed (JR) and non
job-routed (NJR) stock levels. JR items are those items that are repaired as part of a higher
assembly repair. The stock level in support of JR overhaul requirements represents the amount of
stock required to prevent delay of programmed overhauls during the subassembly O&ST. NJR
items are those items that are removed during an overhaul and turned into supply. The NJR stock
AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013                                                                       251

Donations—Donable property under the control of a Military Service and/or a Defense Agency
authorized for donation by statute to an authorized done.
Economic Order Quantity—Quantity derived from a mathematical technique used to determine
the optimum (lowest) total variable costs to order and hold inventory.
Economic Retention Stock—ERS is stock above the AAO that is more economical to retain
than to dispose of. To warrant economic retention, an item should have a reasonably predictable
demand rate. If the expected demand for an item is not predictable, yet the expectation for future
demand is probable, the item may still have ERS provided the managing DoD Component has a
documented rationale that economically justifies retention and is available for audit purposes.
Electronic-Mall—An Internet-based electronic mall designed to make it easier for customers to
place and track orders and pay for products.
End Item—A final combination of end products, component parts, and/or materiel ready for its

detail record after 60 days.
Materiel—All items (including ships, tanks, self-propelled weapons, and aircraft; etc. and
related spares, repair parts, and support equipment, but excluding real property, installations, and
utilities) necessary to equip, operate, maintain, and support military activities without distinction
as to its application for administrative or combat purposes. Materiel is either serviceable (i.e. in
an issuable condition) or unserviceable (i.e. in need of repair to make it serviceable).
Materiel Cost Recovery—The portion of each exchange price sale that will pay for items
needed to be purchased for customer support. The MCR represents the constrained extended year
buy portion; the constraint being that it cannot be more than the customer is funded.

maintenance action, often the quantity of a component used for each end item.
Mission Impact Code—Values of 1 through 4 are assigned programmatically to all consumable
and recoverable item records during the issue process based upon the Urgency Justification Code
(UJC) of customer issue requests, not customer backorders (this is an important distinction that
ensures all demanded items are assigned appropriate MICs even when customer requests are
issued from shelf stock upon demand). MICs are never programmatically downgraded, but are
upgraded to reflect the priority of subsequent higher priority customer demands.
National Stock Number—13-digit stock number used to identify items of supply. It consists of
a 4-digit FSC and a 9-digit National Item Identification Number (NIIN).
Negotiated Level—If the quantities computed at base level do not provide adequate support, the
MAJCOM may negotiate a special level with the prime inventory management specialist.

Pilferable Item—Controlled inventory item/materiel having a ready resale value or application
to personal possession, which is especially subject to theft.
Post-post—Post-post is a legacy term that identified where transactions were posted/input to
automated systems after the actions were performed. Additionally, it was informally used to
refer to conditions of degraded operations where automated systems are inoperative or when
other circumstances impose significant limitations on normal processing capabilities. In this
publication, the terms manual processing or Degraded Operations are used to refer to those
conditions respectively.
Potential Reutilization/Disposal Materiel—DoD Component materiel identified by an item
manager for possible disposal, but with potential for reutilization; or materiel that has the
potential for being sent by an item manager to the DLADS for possible reutilization by another
DoD Component or by a Federal, State, or local governmental agency, or for disposal through
sale to the public.
Precious Metals—FSC 9660 items that are gold, silver, platinum, or palladium granulation and
sponges, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium recovered from items, such as photographic
and x-ray film, spent photographic fixing solution, military accouterments, such as insignia,
crucibles, special wires, silver cell batteries, missile and electronic scrap, turnings, desalter kits,
brazing alloys, solder, and dental scrap.
Proactive Demand Leveling—Tool that uses global demand data to centrally compute and
maintain levels for DLA-managed items that have no demand level and little or no established
demand pattern. It proactively lays-in Adjusted Stock Levels (ASL) at one base using demand
data from other bases that operate the same weapon system.
Procurement Lead Time—The interval between the initiation of a procurement action and
receipt of the products or services purchased as the result of such action.
Production Lead Time—The time interval between the letting of a contract or the placing of an

documentation and shipments, as well as for the accumulation of intra-Service performance and
cost data related to exercises, maneuvers, and other distinct programs, projects, and operations.
Other than OSD and CJCS assigned codes, project codes do not provide or imply any priority or
precedence for requisition processing or supply decisions. Reference CJCSI 4110.01E, and
DLM 4000.25-1, Appendix 2.13.

guidance conferences, Logistics Support Analysis conferences, etc.).
Readiness—A measure or measures of the ability of a system to undertake and sustain a
specified set of missions at planned peacetime and wartime utilization rates. Measures take
account of the effects of system design (reliability and maintainability), the characteristics of the
support system, and the quantity and location of support resources. Examples of system
readiness measures are combat sortie rate, fully mission capable rate, and operational
availability.
Readiness Based Level—Adjusted stock level representing a centrally-computed quantity
pushed from the AF RBL system. When RBL adjusted stock levels are established, the RBL
quantity becomes the peacetime portion of the total base requirement and the demand-based

in minus stock due-out) reaches or breaches, triggers an order to replenish stock.
Repair Cycle Assets—Any recoverable item with an ERRCD code of XD or XF.
Repair Cycle Demand Level—Pipeline stockage model that seeks to fill the O&ST, the base
repair cycle time (RCT), and the base NRTS condemned time pipelines. Because each of those
pipeline segments and customer demand are variable, the RCDL also includes a safety level
quantity. The RCDL also includes an EOQ component for selected XF3 items.
Repair Cycle Process—Process to establish firm control of all unserviceable repair cycle assets
from the time they are generated until the time they are returned to the LRS/Materiel
Management Activity as serviceable or unserviceable. RCTs start when the DIFM item is issued
to the customer, and ends when the item (serviceable or unserviceable) is returned to the
LRS/Materiel Management Activity.
Reparable Item—An item that can be repaired at either depot or field level.
Replenishment—Actions to resupply an inventory when the inventory position reaches the
reorder point.
Required Delivery Date (RDD)—A date specifying when materiel is actually required to be
delivered to the requisitioner and is always earlier or later than the computed standard delivery
 258                                                                 AFI23-101 8 AUGUST 2013

Standardization—AF standardization operations are conducted primarily within the framework
of the Defense Standardization Program (DSP) and in accordance with DoD 4120.24-M, DoD
Defense Standardization Program Policies and Procedures Manual. The main objectives are to
achieve and maintain the highest practicable degree of standardization for items, materiel,
practices, procedures, and terminology by preparing standardization documents. In addition to
participating in the DSP, the AF standardization mission entails the conduct of, and participation
in, various other related programs and projects, including International Standardization
Programs, Non-Government Standards (NGS) Bodies, Parts Control Programs, and Overpricing
Programs.

Reimbursements and collections derived from such operations are available for use by the fund
without further action by the Congress.
Stock Level—Demand level or an adjusted level.
Stockage Priority Code—Retail materiel management system programmatically assigns SPCs
to consumable items. The requirements program uses SPCs to help determine when the items
should be stocked for future use. SPCs are also used to prevent item stockage.
Stratification Process—A uniform portrayal of requirements and assets application that is a
computer generated, time-phased simulation of actions causing changes in the supply position;
e.g., procurement, repair, receipt, issue, termination, and disposal of materiel.
Substitutable Item—An item possessing functional and physical characteristics that make it

in all applications for item A, but item A shall not be used in all applications requiring item B.
Supply Chain Operations Reference Model—The SCOR model is a commercially based
supply chain integration model used to describe business activities associated with all phases of
satisfying a customer demand. The model is organized around the five primary management
processes of Plan, Source, Make/Maintain, Deliver, and Return. By describing supply chains
using these building blocks, the model may be used to describe supply chains that are very
simple or very complex using a common set of definitions.
Supply Support Request Processing—A request by a Materiel Management Activity making
them a user of a consumable/field repairable item managed by another Materiel Management
Activity.
Suspect Counterfeit Materiel—items, or products in which there is an indication by visual

structure using a command and control process to ensure the quantity, condition, and location of
critical assets are visible.
Total OIM Demand Rate—The rate at which an item has failed. It is developed by dividing the
sum of the base repaired this station (RTS), base not reparable this station (NRTS), and the base
condemnations by the item past program for the period.
Totally Redistributable Materiel—Exists when a base has serviceable shelf stock for items
with no historical demand data or base peacetime need (no demand driven or ASL), or when a
base has unserviceable assets located in the warehouse.
Tanks, Racks, Adapters, and Pylons (TRAP)—Those items of aircraft suspension and release
equipment (S&RE) and aircraft fuel tanks that are subject to in-flight consumption (consumed,
jettisoned, expended, etc.) from the platform (aerial vehicle; aircraft) on which it is installed.
Turnaround—The means to record demand data in the materiel management system for either
repairs in place or removal, repair, reinstallation of a recoverable item without ordering a
replacement item.
Uniform Materiel Movement and Issue Priority System (UMMIPS)—UMMIPS sets
priorities for the issuance and movement of materiels. The system enables supply customers to
use one of 15 priority designators when requisitioning supply items. These 15 priority
designators are based on two components: the UND defines the relative importance of the item
ordered to the unit’s mission and the FAD defines the relative importance of the unit placing the
order. Reference CJCSI 4100.01E.
Unserviceable Asset Price—The price charged to a customer to purchase an unserviceable asset
from the ICP. It includes the carcass cost of the unserviceable asset plus the BOCR. UAP is also
equal to the SP minus the LRC.

supply. It is required to be on-hand to permit continuous operations in the event of minor
interruption of normal replenishment or unpredictable fluctuations in demand.
War Reserve Materiel—Consists of enterprise managed, dynamically positioned equipment
and consumables that contribute to initial operations and provide initial support cross the full
range of military operations. It enhances Agile Combat Support capability to reduce the time
required to achieve an operational capability and/or produce an operational effect.
