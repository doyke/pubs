1.1. Purpose. The purpose of the AFSOC L2 program is to develop and execute the lessons learned
process to improve operational and training effectiveness, support AFSOC leadership, provide lessons to
support Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership & Education, Personnel and Facilities
(DOTMLPF) changes, and integrate lessons with AFSOC investments, planning, programming, and
budgeting decisions. This supplement also supports the United States Special Operations Command
(USSOCOM) Lessons Learned Program, IAW USSOCOM Directive 11-3, by outlining the collection,
archiving, analysis, resolution, and dissemination (CAARD) of L2 submitted to the command. It also
addresses the AFSOC Lessons Learned Working Group (LLWG) and the L2 Fast-Track processes along
with L2 Electronic Validation and Direct Entry procedures.

than 30 days, an interim report will be provided to HQ AFSOC/A3 and HQ AFSOC/A9L at each 30 day
period from the deployment date. All AFSOC L2 must be validated by wing/group (or equivalent)
leadership before entry into L2 databases for validation by the AFSOC LLWG. If AAR/L2 submission
is not within 30 days, units will make mission commanders available for post mission interviews to be
conducted by HQ AFSOC/A9L.
4.5.1. (Added) Special Operations Debriefing and Retrieval System (SODARS), After Action Reports
(AAR), Tactics After Action Reports (TAAR), Tactics Improvement Proposals (TIP), event hot washes,

respective database until validated by the AFSOC chain of command. L2 entered via web page(s) will
be automatically forwarded to HQ AFSOC/A9L. HQ AFSOC/A9L will then forward the L2 to the
respective group/wing L2 POC for chain-of-command validation. No L2 received by HQ AFSOC/A9L
via web page(s) will be worked without first obtaining chain-of-command validation.
4.5.4. (Added) L2 Word document submissions (or similar programs such as portable document file

â€—CLOSEDâ€˜ at the LLWG level and entered into JLLIS and / or USSOCOM JLLIS-SOF by HQ
AFSOC/A9L.
5.5.2.5. (Added) For L2s requiring further action and designated as â€•ACTION OPENâ€– during the
Electronic LLWG Validation Process, a status update will be provided by the OPR at the next scheduled
LLWG monthly update briefing (see paragraph 5.5.3.).
5.5.2.6. (Added) During the Electronic Validation Process, all HQ AFSOC/A9L recommendations are
coordinated through the LLWG primary members for approval via an electronic Staff Summary Sheet
(SSS).
5.5.3. (Added) LLWG Monthly Update Briefing:
5.5.3.1. (Added) Meets monthly with the OPR (AFSOC Deputy Directors, Special Staff (as required),
and 623 AOC/CV), assisted by their respective subject matter experts (SME), providing updated status
on resolution of assigned L2.

5.5.4.3. (Added) AARs and L2s that, after initial review and analysis by HQ AFSOC/A9L, require no
LLWG/MAJCOM action, will be forwarded by HQ AFSOC/A9L to the LLWG Chair for validation and
approval for entry into JLLIS and JLLIS-SOF.
5.5.4.4. (Added) In general, these AAR and L2 require no action on the part of the LLWG and/or are
issues that are being worked at the wing/group level and forwarded to HQ AFSOC for information
purposes only.
5.5.4.5. (Added) In the event PERSTEMPO does not allow LLWG Chair timely review of Fast Track
L2s (normally within 5 working days of receipt), HQ AFSOC/A51 will perform the validation process
and approve for entry into JLLIS and USSOCOM JLLIS-SOF, where appropriate.
5.5.5. (Added) Direct Entry of L2 into JLLISand JLLIS-SOF:
5.5.5.1. (Added) Some L2 do not require LLWG or L2 Fast Track processing prior to entry into JLLIS
or JLLIS-SOF data bases. These L2 can be historical in nature (over 3-years old), or have a formal
vetting and validation process outside the HQ AFSOC/A9L processes outlined in this supplement. They
are generally published reports, including after action reports and formal test reports, and include (but
are not limited to) the following:
5.5.5.2. (Added) HQ AFSOC/HO published historical documents.

not merit action by the LLWG (examples include: AC-130 employment in Vietnam, L2 from
Operations JUST CAUSE / DESERT STORM, etc.).
5.5.5.6. (Added) 18th and 413th Flight Test Squadronsâ€˜ and any SOF specific published test reports.
5.5.5.7. 6th Special Operations Squadron published After Action Reports once vetted through HQ
AFSOC.
