                                           Chapter 1
                                 GENERAL INFORMATION


1.1. Evaluation Program. Standardization and evaluation across units, missions, and functional
areas are done to gain efficiencies in processes, to increase combat capability, and to provide
common training products where possible. Unit-level evaluations will challenge an Airman’s
ability to operate in the heart of the nuclear envelope and validate that they are trained to meet
the nuclear needs of the military. Evaluations measure proficiency on existing, new, or revised
procedures and equipment, verify procedures are being trained properly to support mission
accomplishment and provide feedback on training programs. They also provide squadron
leadership feedback on an individual’s or crew’s demonstrated performance.
    1.1.1. Units will design and implement evaluation programs to ensure procedures contained in
    technical orders, checklists, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), and operations
    manuals are standardized, accurate, and effective to accomplish the mission.
    1.1.2. Units will evaluate in accordance with established Training and Evaluation
    Performance Standards (TEPS) and Emergency War Order (EWO) TEPS (ETEPS).
      1.1.2.1. Reference AFGSC Instruction (AFGSCI) 13-5301v1, Rapid Execution and Combat
      Targeting (REACT) Crew Training, and AFGSCI 13-5301v4, (S) Rapid Execution and
      Combat Targeting (REACT) Emergency War Order (EWO) Training and Evaluation
      Procedures (U), for the Job Performance Requirement (JPR) List (JPRL).
      1.1.2.2. Reference AFGSCI 13-5301v1 and AFGSCI 13-5301v4 for a complete listing of
      established performance standards and constraints.
    1.1.3. Units will use the performance standards to measure crew member proficiency on
    existing, new, or revised procedures and equipment.
    1.1.4. In the event of a contradiction between this instruction and other REACT crew member
    evaluation guidance found in another Major Command (MAJCOM) or lower publication, this
    instruction will take precedence. Units will notify HQ AFGSC/A3T and the OPR of the
    conflicting instruction through appropriate channels of the specific paragraphs.

                               EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS


2.1. Evaluation Processes. Units, in coordination with 20 AF, will develop processes to
conduct evaluations of missile combat crew members (MCCMs), validate training and provide
feedback to the individuals and squadron on a crew members’ demonstrated performance in
order to fulfill evaluation program requirements outlined in this instruction.
    2.1.1. Reference Attachment 2, Table A2.1, for an evaluation program overview.
    2.1.2. AFGSCI 13-5301v3, Rapid Execution and Combat Targeting (REACT) Crew
    Operations, requires 12 hours of crew rest prior to a scheduled event. For crew rest purposes,
    a duty period that includes administrative duties and participation in one evaluation and
    subsequent training/briefings directed to satisfy corrective action requirements is considered a
    single scheduled event, provided the entire duty period does not exceed 10 hours.
2.2. Evaluation Categories. Evaluations given by units and HHQ inspectors will fall into one of
two specific categories.
    2.2.1. Full-Check. Full-check evaluations are given to MCCMs following initial training,
    upgrade training or given on a recurring basis. Full-check evaluations will meet JPR coverage
    necessary to advance a crew member’s delinquency date.
    2.2.2. Special-Check. Special-check evaluations are given to MCCMs to validate training,
    check proficiency or satisfy corrective action requirements. Special-check evaluations may
    not meet evaluation criteria of a Full-Check and may not advance a crew member’s
    delinquency date.
2.3. Evaluation Types.
    2.3.1. Initial Evaluation. Initial evaluations are full-check evaluations given to determine
    proficiency and capability of crews upon completion of IST and staff officers upon
    completion of Requalification Training (RQT) as applicable.

     and Missile Alert Facility (MAF) activities (maintenance, targeting, etc.).
     2.4.3.2. Units will ensure operational evaluations conducted are distributed equally among
     the missile squadrons.
     2.4.3.3. A minimum of 10 percent of all operational evaluations conducted annually will be
     given at an Alternate Command Post/ Squadron Command Post (ACP/SCP) configured
     LCC.
2.5. Delinquency Dates. The delinquency date establishes the maximum time until a CMR
individual must receive a qualification evaluation.
  2.5.1. All CMR crew members must receive qualification evaluations as a periodic check on
  proficiency. Failure to receive a qualification evaluation before the individual’s delinquency
  date causes the individual to be placed in restricted status.

     2.5.2. If time does not permit a crew member to receive an evaluation prior to a deployment,
     the operator will be placed in restricted or decertified status at the time restriction or
     decertification is required. Refer to AFGSCI 13-5301v1 for removal from restricted or
     decertified status.
     2.5.3. If the incumbent ICBM Senior Instructor Combat Crew Commanders or ICBM Senior
     Evaluator Combat Crew Commanders are not evaluated by 20 AF evaluators prior to their
     delinquency date, they must be evaluated by the unit.
       2.5.3.1. ICBM Senior Instructor Combat Crew Commanders will be evaluated by the
       ICBM Senior Evaluator Combat Crew Commanders or evaluator certified weapons
       officers. The Chief, ICBM Standardization and Evaluation will observe the evaluation.
       2.5.3.2. ICBM Senior Evaluator Combat Crew Commanders will be evaluated by two
       CMR commander evaluators chosen by the Chief, ICBM Standardization and Evaluation or
       evaluator certified weapons officers. The Chief, ICBM Standardization and Evaluation
       will observe the evaluation.
2.6. Delinquency Date Calculation. The delinquency date is calculated from the date of
evaluation completion.
     2.6.1. Delinquency dates following full-check evaluation are established by calculating the
     first day of the 13th month following successful completion of a full-check evaluation.
       2.6.1.1. If the full-check evaluation is rated Q3, establish the delinquency date by
       calculating the first day of the 13th month following successful completion of the resulting
       requalification evaluation.
     2.6.2. Spot and special HHQ evaluations will not advance the delinquency date.

AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                            17

        3.7.1.1.2. When an evaluator is placed in CMR restricted status for medical reasons, the
        evaluator may conduct simulator evaluations if they have received all recurring training
        and maintained currency.
        3.7.1.1.3. When an evaluator is placed in CMR restricted status for non-performance of
        alert duties in accordance with AFGSCI 13-5301v1, the evaluator may conduct
        simulator evaluations if they have received recurring training and maintained currency.
        3.7.1.1.4. Evaluators who are CMR restricted will not perform LCC evaluations.
     3.7.1.2. The individual does not receive quarterly recurring evaluator training.
     3.7.1.3. The individual fails to receive an annual observation.

     Standardization and Evaluation.
  3.7.2. Only evaluators who are CMR certified and not in restricted status are authorized to
  conduct evaluations in the LCC.
3.8. Removal from Restricted Status. Evaluators may be removed from evaluator restricted
status upon completion of corrective actions.
  3.8.1. Units will document corrective actions and removal from evaluator restricted status
  using the AFGSC Form 913. Remove an individual from evaluator restricted status for the
  following:
     3.8.1.1. Individuals who were placed in CMR restricted status must be removed from CMR
     restricted status.
     3.8.1.2. Individuals who missed quarterly evaluator training must complete the applicable
     training that was missed.
     3.8.1.3. Individuals who failed to receive an annual observation must receive an annual
     observation.
     3.8.1.4. Individuals placed in evaluator restricted status at the direction of the OG
     commander, deputy commander or Chief, ICBM Standardization and Evaluation must
     satisfy requirements established by the certifying official.
3.9. Decertification and Recertification Requirements. The OG commander will decertify
and recertify evaluators when needed.
  3.9.1. Units will document evaluator decertification using the AFGSC Form 914, Crew
  Member Decertifications. Evaluators will be decertified in writing for the following reasons:
     3.9.1.1. Individual is no longer needed as an MPT and/or LCC evaluator.
     3.9.1.2. Individual no longer possesses the degree of proficiency or professionalism
     required.
     3.9.1.3. Individual departs unit due to a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) or PCA.
     3.9.1.4. Individual is decertified from CMR duties.
  3.9.2. Upon decertification, the individual will not conduct CMR evaluations. This does not
  prevent evaluator duties such as an MPT operator, etc.

evaluator within AFGSC, they will not be required to re-accomplish an entire training program at
the new assignment.
     3.10.1. Stan/Eval offices must assess the individual’s previous evaluator experience to
     ascertain whether an individual requires further training to meet the unit’s needs. At a
     minimum, provide training on local procedures and equipment before certifying the
     individual.
     3.10.2. A crew member who has been previously certified as a deputy evaluator does not need
     to re-accomplish initial evaluator training prior to certification as a commander evaluator.

                        EVALUATION SCENARIOS AND SCRIPTS


4.1. Evaluation Scenarios. A scenario is a specific task or set of tasks presented in a coherent
manner to simulate operational conditions for the purpose of evaluating crew members.
  4.1.1. Performance tasks identified in the JPRL in Attachment 2 of AFGSCI 13-5301v1, will
  be evaluated using scenarios.
  4.1.2. Each MPT session must have the following items available:
     4.1.2.1. TEAP-TF 214.
     4.1.2.2. Training targeting documents [i.e. Handbook for ICBM Targeting (HIT) TF 214,

     a scripted scenario.
  4.1.3. Evaluation scenario results are based on successfully meeting each task or subtask
  performance standard.
  4.1.4. Crews will conduct mission planning to apply critical thinking skills necessary to
  execute the MPT evaluation event. Mission planning is a mandatory event in the evaluation
  process; however, mission planning sessions will not be under evaluation.
     4.1.4.1. Both crew members must be present during mission planning.
20                                                     AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013

        4.1.4.2. Missile combat crew mission planning will incorporate applicable aspects of the
        five mission planning phases outlined in AFGSCI 13-5301v3, Rapid Execution and
        Combat Targeting (REACT) Crew Operations. The Crew Preparation, GO/NO-GO Brief,
        and Re-Planning phases are not required to be completed during mission planning for MPT
        evaluation events.
           4.1.4.2.1. The Data Gathering Phase will be used to provide crews with the most
           comprehensive and accurate data for use in successfully planning and executing the
           MPT evaluation event. Data will be presented to the crew no earlier than one hour
           before evaluation start time and will include information similar to data gathered for
           alert (weather, planned maintenance, MAF/LF status, etc.).
           4.1.4.2.2. The Crew Plan Development Phase will be used for crews to discuss their plan
           for successfully completing scenarios as well as potential outcomes based upon starting
           status. It is not possible to plan for all contingencies, but crews should develop backup
           plans for those that are most likely. This phase will be conducted at a location
           determined by OGV.
        4.1.4.3. Evaluatees must be provided facilities to conduct mission planning prior to an
        evaluation. A copy of operations technical orders, nuclear surety and security directives or
        any other reference material helpful to mission planning in accordance with local
        procedures must be readily available.
           4.1.4.3.1. Once evaluatees have been provided evaluation scenario information for
           mission planning, the crew must remain in the mission planning area and must not
           interact with any personnel other than the evaluators.
        4.1.4.4. All personnel dispatching for an operational evaluation must accomplish mission
        planning in accordance with AFGSCI 13-5301v3.
           4.1.4.4.1. Evaluators dispatching to the field for purposes of conducting an evaluation(s)
           must provide a GO/NO-GO Brief. At the discretion of the OG/CC, briefings may be
           given to the Chief, ICBM Standardization and Evaluation or the appropriate tactical
           squadron commander.
4.2. Evaluation Scenario Conduct. Evaluators will ensure all scenario stimuli are presented as
written in the script and will provide a fair and unbiased evaluation of the crew.
     4.2.1. Crew members are permitted to use products developed during the mission planning
     period prior to the evaluation. Evaluators will review materials used by the crew to ensure
     they do not supplement technical data or demonstrate script compromise.
     4.2.2. For all evaluations, there will be at least a one-to-one ratio of evaluators to evaluatees.
     A crew commander will only be evaluated or observed by a commander evaluator. The
     deputy commander will be evaluated or observed by either a deputy evaluator or dual
     qualified commander evaluator.
     4.2.3. During an evaluation, the evaluators will not challenge, correct, or prompt the evaluatee
     as to the validity of the actions performed except to provide proper weapon system status.
AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                             21

     4.2.3.1. If the crew under evaluation in the MPT passes direction to another LCC or
     agency, that agency will take the actions directed by the crew regardless if the direction is
     incorrect. If incorrect direction is passed in the LCC, the evaluators will step in, correct
     actions and assess the error.
     4.2.3.2. Outside agencies will not challenge, correct, or prompt any crew actions, but will
     only provide guidance as directed technical orders and applicable directives.
  4.2.4. Evaluatees are only permitted to ask questions to clarify a stimulus. Evaluators will not
  give more information than would normally be available or that would prompt a response.
  4.2.5. Evaluatees will be given the opportunity to correctly perform an action or to take an
  incorrect action; however, evaluators must intervene to prevent a safety hazard or damage to
  any equipment. Errors will be assessed in accordance with Chapter 5 of this publication.
  4.2.6. During an evaluation, the evaluator may ask questions to clarify an evaluatee’s response
  to a task. Evaluators will ensure questions will not interfere with crew actions, interrupt crew
  actions or prompt the evaluatee.
  4.2.7. A crew consisting of an ACP/SCP certified commander and deputy commander will be
  evaluated performing ACP/SCP duties.
  4.2.8. Evaluators must always provide status that crew members would normally detect with
  their senses (heat, air, smoke, etc.) when it cannot be simulated by the MPT. Status cards will
  be used to the maximum extent possible. Evaluators will ensure proper configuration is
  programmed whenever possible or briefed to the crew.
4.3. Evaluation Scripts. Units will design and use scripts to conduct evaluation scenarios. Unit-
level evaluations will verify proficiency and validate unit training through robust and challenging
evaluation scenarios that adhere to technical orders and all higher-headquarters evaluation
standards.
  4.3.1. Units will ensure all required (“R”) weapon system and codes JPRs, as specified in the
  JPRL, are evaluated at least once every 12 months and all EWO JPRs are evaluated in
  accordance with AFGSCI 13-5301v4. JPR coverage for each monthly qualification
  evaluation will be in accordance with the established Annual Training and Evaluation Plan
  (ATEP) developed by 20 AF.
     4.3.1.1. Units will maintain four monthly qualification evaluation scripts on-line. Units
     will maintain the current month’s script and the three prior month’s scripts to be shown
     during the current calendar month.
     4.3.1.2. The rate of exposure for each script during a calendar month will be evenly
     distributed. To the maximum extent possible, each script should be shown approximately
     25% of the time during the current calendar month.
     4.3.1.3. To preserve the integrity of the evaluation program, crews will not be informed in
     advance of the evaluation script selected, or provided an opportunity to view any portion of
     an evaluation script.
  4.3.2. All simulation materials will be marked “For Training Use Only” or “For Evaluation
  Use Only”.
22                                                    AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013

     4.3.3. Full-check evaluation scripts will present valid stimuli for both peacetime and wartime
     scenarios. Special-check evaluation scripts will contain valid stimuli for the scenarios
     presented.
       4.3.3.1. Stimuli will be identified by JPR, task description, scenario support personnel,
       initiation and response agencies and notes or expected responses (TEPS/ETEPS notes,
       evaluator notes, expected evaluatee response, etc.).
       4.3.3.2. Estimated scenario run times are for scenario presentation only and do not establish
       a time standard for completing actions. Applicable proficiency time standards must be
       annotated within the script.
       4.3.3.3. Scripts must have a plan for presentation of problem sequences and events that
       specify instructions for evaluators, MPT operators and scenario support personnel. Scripts
       will include instructions for simulated inputs, status cards or briefings and will identify
       proper crew responses.
     4.3.4. Problem presentation and equipment response must comply with TEPS/ETEPS
     constraints.
       4.3.4.1. Evaluators should follow the script as written. However, if following the script as
       it is written causes inaccurate presentation, use evaluator judgment and provide accurate
       status.
     4.3.5. Use status cards or briefings to introduce stimuli that cannot be presented in a more
     realistic manner. Cards and briefs must not prompt, but must have enough information for the
     evaluatee to clearly understand the input.
     4.3.6. Do not create actual conditions that could jeopardize personnel safety or cause
     equipment damage.
     4.3.7. Evaluation scripts will be technically accurate in accordance with technical orders and
     applicable directives.
     4.3.8. Scenarios should be designed so that all actions are accomplished as a crew, except
     where technical order directs, or allows for, split crew operations.
     4.3.9. Scripts will not be written to evaluate a crew on field evaluatable tasks.
     4.3.10. Simulate realistic operational environments in the MPT requiring the evaluatee to
     prioritize actions.
       4.3.10.1. Multiple inputs may be introduced to determine a crew’s capability to establish
       priorities. Do not inject unrelated tasks or status (EXAMPLE: two events occurring
       simultaneously where one task does not logically lead to another) while the crew is
       accomplishing critical phases of Level A TEPS/ETEPS performances. This does not
       preclude the presentation of expected follow-on weapon system indications related to
       previous inputs, provided those indications do not directly interfere with the crew's ability
       to execute its critical actions.
AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                            23

      4.3.10.1.1. If unrelated status occurs during a Level A TEPS/ETEPS as the result of
      equipment malfunction or due to the evaluator but the status does not have an impact on
      the crew’s ability to effectively execute its critical actions, the evaluator will
      immediately brief the crew to disregard status and adjust the Level A TEPS/ETEPS.
      The scenario event is valid.
      4.3.10.1.2. If unrelated status occurs during a Level A TEPS/ETEPS as the result of
      equipment malfunction or due to the evaluator, and the status has an impact upon the
      crew’s ability to effectively execute its critical actions, the evaluator will immediately
      brief the crew to disregard status. The scenario event is invalid and errors will not be
      assessed.
   4.3.10.2. Scenarios should be designed to evaluate concepts and avoid presentation of
   excessive weapon system status. No more than three simultaneous problems will be
   included in any evaluation script.
 4.3.11. Do not use the current operational or exercise duress words (primary or alternate) in
 evaluation scenarios.
 4.3.12. EWO and weapon system portions of the evaluation may be designed to provide a
 seamless evaluation.
 4.3.13. Scripts are normally designed not to exceed the following time standards:
   4.3.13.1. Initial evaluations should not be scripted to exceed 4.5 hours.
   4.3.13.2. Upgrade, Qualification and Full HHQ evaluations should not be scripted to
   exceed 3 hours.
   4.3.13.3. Unit special-check evaluations should not be scripted to exceed 2 hours.
   4.3.13.4. Special HHQ evaluations will be scripted to meet HHQ needs.
 4.3.14. Evaluation scripts must be fully coordinated prior to being used for documented
 evaluations. Coordination must be documented with name and date at a minimum.
   4.3.14.1. Weapon system safety rule (WSSR) or missile safety events will be coordinated
   with the wing safety office for approval.
   4.3.14.2. Communications Security (COMSEC) events, products or scripted events will be
   coordinated with the OSS COMSEC Responsible Officer (CRO) for approval.
   4.3.14.3. Codes related events will be coordinated with the codes flight for Chief, ICBM
   Codes approval.
   4.3.14.4. EWO related events will be coordinated with an EWO training and EWO plans
   representative for Chief, ICBM Emergency War Orders approval.
      4.3.14.4.1. At a minimum, one evaluation must be observed by a certified EWO
      instructor during each calendar month to ensure EWO procedures are presented
      accurately. The EWO instructor will report inaccurate presentation to the Chief, ICBM
      Standardization and Evaluation immediately upon evaluation termination. Inaccurate
      presentation will invalidate a scenario; therefore, evaluators must ensure minimum
      evaluation criteria was met before adjusting delinquency date information.
24                                                   AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013

       4.3.14.5. Weapon system events will be coordinated with the Chief, ICBM Current
       Operations Training for approval. The Chief, ICBM Standardization and Evaluation is the
       final approval for all MPT evaluation scripts.
     4.3.15. Units must retain evaluation scripts and ancillary items such as dispatches, status cards
     and script programming, in either paper or electronic copy, for a period of at least 12 months
     from the on-line date. This does not require a removable storage element for old revision
     products. Off-line scripts do not require updates.
       4.3.15.1. A script may be considered off-line after four calendar months from the
       established on-line date.
4.4. TEPS/ETEPS and Timing Constraints. TEPS/ETEPS detail task performance, standards,
timing requirements and constraints for the express purpose of standardizing training and
evaluation that support operational mission ready certification requirements.
     4.4.1. TEPS/ETEPS are designed for preparing and presenting training and evaluation
     materials and will be used to prioritize tasks during an evaluation. TEPS/ETEPS will not
     supplement technical data or instructions.
     4.4.2. TEPS/ETEPS are divided into three levels.
       4.4.2.1. Level A - Tasks, if not performed correctly, could result in mission failure,
       endangerment of human life, serious injury or death or require an elevated level of
       proficiency.
          4.4.2.1.1. Level A tasks have the greatest potential for mission and/or personnel impacts
          and drive the most stringent training and evaluation program requirements.
          4.4.2.1.2. Asterisked Level A performance standards are not subject to judgment, require
          strict application and adherence. An asterisked Level A is used where a direct
          correlation exists between exceeding the time and a tangible undesirable outcome, or
          requires a higher level of proficiency necessary for mission accomplishment.
          4.4.2.1.3. Non-asterisked Level A performance standards provide an objective
          measurement guideline for performances requiring urgent action. Because event
          outcome may be influenced by outside factors, there is not always a direct correlation
          between outcome and successful completion of task-associated actions within the
          specified time parameter(s). Exceeding one of these times may not indicate a serious
          deficiency based on judgment and assessment of the specific scenario. Non-asterisked
          performance standards are guidelines to aid unit commanders in determining corrective
          actions.
          4.4.2.1.4. When an event has an associated Level A time standard, do not present new
          unrelated status until the Level A time standard has expired or has been successfully
          accomplished.
          4.4.2.1.5. If the subsequent event has a Level A time standard, time it normally, without
          adjustment for the "pending" original time standard.
          4.4.2.1.6. When more than one Level A time standard is running simultaneously, time
          them concurrently only if specifically written for concurrent timing, otherwise, time
          separately and sequentially.
AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                               25

           4.4.2.1.6.1. The only instance concurrent Level A time standards should occur is
           when there are multiple Level A time standards associated with a task.
        4.4.2.1.7. During a Level A TEPS timing standard event, as long as an evaluatee
        completes the task within the allotted TEPS time period, the only errors assessed during
        this period should be attributed to incorrect actions.
     4.4.2.2. Level B - Tasks deemed integral to the performance of other tasks and required to
     sustain acceptable weapon system operation and mission execution.
        4.4.2.2.1. Operators must accomplish Level B tasks properly without taking any
        intervening lower priority actions that would, in the normal sequence of events,
        adversely affect task performance or outcome.
     4.4.2.3. Level C - Rudimentary or simple tasks related to weapons system operations that
     by themselves have little or no impact on mission execution.
        4.4.2.3.1. Level C tasks apply where no specific time standard is identified. The
        standard is to accomplish the task proficiently in accordance with technical orders and
        governing directives.
  4.4.3. Level B and C performances within Level A tasks must be performed correctly in
  accordance with technical orders, governing instructions or other applicable documents.
  4.4.4. Level A, B, and C tasks must be accomplished without outside assistance except as
  specified by the governing technical order, HHQ instruction or publication.
  4.4.5. Outside agency responses will not be used to satisfy accomplishment of TEPS/ETEPS.
  If the MCC has the technical data to satisfy the required task(s), the outside agency will not
  provide the data.
4.5. Status Presentation. Crew members must be presented proper configuration and status for
operational realism.
  4.5.1. Status presentation requirements and configuration actions for fire/overheat conditions,
  nuclear detonation (NUDET) and Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP)/High Altitude Burst (HAB)
  indications will be provided by 20 AF. Reference AFGSCI 13-5301v4 for additional
  presentation or configuration requirements.
  4.5.2. Status cards and briefings will be standardized and presented in accordance with 20 AF
  direction.
4.6. Briefings. It is the responsibility of the evaluators to conduct appropriate briefings
throughout the course of an evaluation.
  4.6.1. Evaluators will conduct a pre-brief for evaluatees to set the environment of the
  evaluation and to ensure the evaluatees clearly understand expectations, responsibilities,
  limitations and other rules of engagement before being administered the evaluation.
  4.6.2. For evaluation scenarios conducted in the operational environment, evaluators will pre-
  brief the Flight Security Controller (FSC), Facility Manager (FM) and other topside support
  personnel as applicable, ensuring they understand their roles and limitations.
  4.6.3. Evaluators may use briefings as necessary for scenario transitions, scenario presentation
  and to alleviate the crew from performing unnecessary actions.
26                                                    AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013

       4.6.3.1. Units will standardize phrases used during evaluation breaks, between script events
       and termination. Standardized verbiage eliminates evaluator prompting that could occur
       when a crew has not completed all required actions before evaluation termination.
       4.6.3.2. During an MPT evaluation, if a crew transitions to a field evaluatable task as
       defined in the JPRL, the evaluator will brief the task or subtask accomplished when the
       crew member identifies the requirement to transition.
       4.6.3.3. If the crew has correctly accomplished a task, the task re-occurs, and is not
       intended to be evaluated again, an evaluator may brief the task accomplished when the
       crew identifies the requirement to re-accomplish the task.
       4.6.3.4. If a task is not intended to be evaluated, and is not the result of a crew’s incorrect
       action, evaluators may brief the task accomplished when the crew identifies the
       requirement to accomplish the task.
4.7. Evaluation Scenario Termination. Once an evaluation is started, all efforts will be made to
complete the evaluation.
     4.7.1. Situations may arise in which early evaluation termination would be required.
     Evaluations terminated early may be re-initiated from the point activity was originally
     stopped, or the evaluation may be completely re-accomplished.
     4.7.2. Before deviating from the approved script and terminating a full-check evaluation, the
     evaluators must determine if the minimum JPR coverage and Level A requirements outlined
     in paragraphs 2.3.1. through 2.3.4. have been met to warrant a valid evaluation.
     4.7.3. Evaluators will ensure the evaluatee’s technical orders have been properly posted
     following each MPT evaluation termination.
4.8. Operational Evaluations. The operational evaluation is conducted in the LCC by
evaluating tasks based on actual status as it occurs and those tasks directed by technical orders or
regulations. When conducting an evaluation on operational equipment, the on-duty crew
commander maintains authority during the evaluation.
     4.8.1. Prior to an evaluation scenario conducted in the operational environment, the OG/CC or
     OG/CD must gauge impact to field operations before dispatching evaluators. Units will use
     risk management processes to mitigate any adverse operational impact and unnecessary
     operational risks are avoided.
     4.8.2. Evaluators may conduct changeover and assume custody of the alert for the duration of
     the evaluation if they are on the Missile Alert Duty Order (MADO).
     4.8.3. Safety and operational actions take priority over simulated actions. Evaluators will
     intervene to prevent a safety hazard, damage to equipment, mission failure or degradation.
     4.8.4. ACP/SCP certified crews evaluated in a PLCC will be evaluated as a PLCC crew.
     4.8.5. If the evaluatee does not react to situations requiring immediate crew response to
     prevent personnel injury, damage to equipment, or mission degradation, the evaluators will
     bring the situation to their attention as follows:
AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                               27

     4.8.5.1. If the evaluatee is not in position to note an operational status change, the evaluator
     will immediately bring it to their attention. Do not assess a deficiency for bringing the
     status change to the evaluatee's attention.
     4.8.5.2. If the evaluatee is in position to note an operational status change, but does not act,
     the evaluator will immediately bring it to his or her attention. If in the opinion of the
     evaluator the individual had sufficient time to observe the status change and failed to
     recognize or take appropriate action, assess and rate the appropriate task deficiency.
  4.8.6. If the evaluatee does not react to operational situations not covered by paragraph 4.8.5.,
  the evaluators will bring the situation to their attention as follows:
     4.8.6.1. If the evaluatee is in position to note an operational status change, and the lack of a
     timely response would negatively impact operations, bring the status change to their
     attention after the evaluatee has had reasonable time to note the change. Evaluators will
     assess the appropriate deficiency.
     4.8.6.2. If the evaluatee is in position to note an operational status change, and the lack of a
     timely response would not negatively impact operations, bring the status change to their
     attention after evaluation termination and assess the appropriate deficiency.
  4.8.7. If potential exists for the crew member in an operational environment to be rated Q3 or
  placed in restricted status, the evaluator must ensure the evaluatee is supervised by an
  evaluator certified in the same position until the evaluatee's qualification status is determined
  or a CMR crew member certified in the same position relieves the evaluatee.
4.9. Outbriefing the Evaluatee. The outbrief provides qualification ratings and feedback to the
evaluatee and the evaluation program.
  4.9.1. Evaluators will brief results to the squadron commander or designated representative,
  and the Chief, ICBM Standardization and Evaluation as soon as practical after each
  evaluation.
     4.9.1.1. The outbrief should include discussion of positive performance, strengths, any
     noted deficiencies, probable causes, and direct/indirect impacts to the mission, personnel,
     and other organizations.
        4.9.1.1.1. The commander or designated representative may direct or request additional
        training and evaluation regardless of rating.
     4.9.1.2. Brief the overall evaluation rating upon completion of an evaluation.
4.10. OPLAN Revision Evaluation Program Requirements. HQ AFGSC/A3T, AFGSC/A3I
and 20 AF will coordinate evaluation program requirements for each major EWO
change/revision. Requirements will be provided to the units no later than 60 days prior to the
EWO change/revision.

                               EVALUATION DOCUMENTATION


5.1. Error Determination. Upon completion of each evaluation, evaluators will identify, assess
and document errors.
     5.1.1. Error determination must be based upon the actions or inactions of the evaluatee.
     5.1.2. When the evaluatee causes a script deviation and an error results, evaluators will assess
     the error.
       5.1.2.1. During a scenario, if a crew takes multiple incorrect actions that lead to an action
       warranting a more severe error, assess only the highest degree error, and fully describe the
       other incorrect actions in the error description (commonly referred to as snowballing).
     5.1.3. Assess errors to only one crew member when, in the evaluator’s judgment, the other
     crew member was not in a position to detect and had no requirement to detect the incorrect
     action.
     5.1.4. Use the Deficiency Codes in Attachment 6 of AFGSCI 13-5301v1 to describe why an
     evaluatee committed an error.
     5.1.5. Evaluators will use definitions and/or examples of errors in paragraphs 5.3. through 5.5.
     of this instruction and the list of errors in AFGSCI 13-5301v4 for error determinations.
     5.1.6. If OGV cannot ascertain how to assess an error for an evaluation after querying all
     required on-base agencies [EWO Plans, Codes, Safety, Missile Maintenance Operations
     Center (MMOC), etc.], call and initiate a formal request for error determination with 20 AF.
       5.1.6.1. 20 AF will analyze the information passed, make a final determination, and
       respond back to the unit OGV as soon as possible. A copy of the determination must be
       provided to HQ AFGSC/A3TV.
       5.1.6.2. If 20 AF is unable to make a final determination, a formal request for error
       determination must be forwarded to HQ AFGSC/A3T. HQ AFGSC/A3T will coordinate
       the error with HQ AFGSC/A3I. The information will be jointly analyzed and formally
       coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM subject matter experts (SME) (AFGSC/A3I,
       AFGSC/SE, etc.). Final error assessment, error severity and operational impact will be
       determined by the MAJCOM SME. HQ AFGSC/A3T will provide the determination to 20
       AF for distribution.
       5.1.6.3. If the outcome of the error determination could result in a Q3 evaluation rating,
       affected crew members must not perform unsupervised alert duties until the evaluation
       results are finalized.
     5.1.7. Following an HHQ administered evaluation, if 20 AF or HQ AFGSC/IG is unable to
     make a final determination, a formal request for error determination must be forwarded to HQ
     AFGSC/A3T.
AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                               29

     5.1.7.1. HQ AFGSC/A3T will coordinate the error with HQ AFGSC/A3I. The information
     will be jointly analyzed and formally coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM SME
     (AFGSC/A3I, AFGSC/SE, etc.). Final error assessment, error severity and operational
     impact will be determined by the MAJCOM SME. HQ AFGSC/A3T will provide the
     determination to initiating agency.
     5.1.7.2. If the outcome of the error determination could result in a Q3 evaluation rating,
     affected crew members must not perform unsupervised alert duties until the evaluation
     results are finalized.
5.2. Error Consummation. Evaluation errors will be assessed on the actions or inactions of the
crew.
  5.2.1. Errors are based on decision points and may be consummated at the expiration of Level
  A TEPS, clock advances or evaluation termination.
     5.2.1.1. Errors will be assessed on incorrect actions at the point of consummation
     regardless of the scripted outcome.
  5.2.2. If a crew fails to accomplish a required Level B task action prior to the clock advance,
  but is able to complete the task after the clock advance, the error may be partially or fully
  recovered depending on the circumstances.
     5.2.2.1. If a clock advance removes the crew’s ability to accomplish the required action
     (reconfigures equipment, removes sortie status, etc.), award the appropriate error for failure
     to accomplish the task.
     5.2.2.2. If a clock advance would result in error consummation, the evaluator will use
     evaluator judgment prior to advancing the clock.
  5.2.3. If a script is written to brief a crew out of actions but the crew has performed an
  incorrect action that could impact future events, allow the crew to continue their actions
  through consummation of the error.
  5.2.4. If a crew takes an incorrect action, document the appropriate error. If recovery to a less
  severe error is possible, evaluators will allow the crew the opportunity to correct their action.
     5.2.4.1. An incorrect report to an outside entity can be corrected to no error if the crew
     takes corrective actions prior to termination of the report or call.
     5.2.4.2. If the MCC directs an incorrect action over phone lines or makes an incorrect
     report, assess the appropriate level of error upon termination of the phone call or report.
     An error is consummated upon termination of an incorrect phone call or report; however, if
     the crew takes corrective actions prior to expiration of any timing standard, recovery to a
     less severe error is possible.
     5.2.4.3. If the MCC transmits an incorrect command, incorrectly accomplishes an internal
     command or test, trips an incorrect circuit breaker or takes an action that causes
     degradation to a redundant environmental control system, the error is consummated
     immediately upon the action taken and recovery is not possible.
     5.2.4.4. Momentary mistakes due to status monitoring, inadvertent actions, or
     miscalculations that are immediately corrected, and do not result in system degradation, or
     degradation to a redundant system, may be recoverable to a lesser severity of error.
30                                                   AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013

5.3. Critical Errors. Assess a critical error when evaluatee actions result, or would reasonably
be expected to result, in operational mission failure, endangerment of human life, serious injury,
or death.
     5.3.1. A mission-critical error results in the crew member being restricted and unqualified for
     all positions. The crew member may not perform unsupervised operations duty until
     successful completion of a requalification evaluation.
     5.3.2. Some examples of critical errors are as follows:
       5.3.2.1. Failure to comply with warnings or technical order safety precautions that could
       reasonably be expected to result in endangerment of human life, serious injury, or death.
       5.3.2.2. Taking a sortie off-line when not required or allowing/ requesting a sortie to be
       taken off-line when not required.
       5.3.2.3. Failure to initiate, direct, or coordinate corrective actions to restore a non-
       operational LCC or ICBM sortie to mission capable status. This includes failure to note or
       report indications of an LCC or ICBM sortie becoming non-operational.
       5.3.2.4. Unnecessary shutdown of an LCC, with or without launch capability.
       5.3.2.5. Violation of two person concept or no-lone zone requirements. This includes
       failure to report violations of two person concept or no-lone zone requirements.
       5.3.2.6. Removal of a sortie from Pendulous Integrating Gyroscopic Accelerometer (PIGA)
       leveling when not authorized by command directives.
       5.3.2.7. Failure to ensure sortie is capable of correctly responding to a Preparatory Launch
       Command (PLC)-A. Sortie must be assigned a PLC-A per command directives.
       5.3.2.8. Actions by the MCC that result in transfer of timeslot when not required,
       unnecessary shutdown of an operational console, removal of ability to command PLC,
       enable command (ENC), or execute launch command (ELC), removal of ability to generate
       target constants, execution plans, or perform remote Data Change (RDC). These critical
       errors are not recoverable once a crew action is taken that removes these capabilities.
          5.3.2.8.1. This includes not exiting the anti-jam mode by status update or evaluation
          termination, unless in anti-jam mode for jamming.
             5.3.2.8.1.1. If, by staying in the anti-jam mode, a crew is unable to accomplish RDC,
             a critical error is warranted.
             5.3.2.8.1.2. If a crew delays RDC and subsequently exits anti-jam, or remains in anti-
             jam, and misses status, or becomes unable to process subsequent scripted events, a
             major error is warranted.
       5.3.2.9. Transferring a case(s) from the Force Direction Message (FDM) Buffer to the Case
       Library prior to the effective time.
       5.3.2.10. Failure to enter the correct Translate Code value or failure to verify Translate
       Codes at crew changeover when required. Assign error to the crew member entering or
       verifying the incorrect value. Error severity may be reduced to a minor if corrected before
       first all-call enable or evaluation termination.
AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                              31

     5.3.2.11. Requesting or allowing a launch capable sortie to be safed, or remain safed, when
     not required.
     5.3.2.12. Violation of any nuclear weapon system safety rules to include the following:
        5.3.2.12.1. Any action or inaction by a crew that allows a sortie to unnecessarily enter
        radio mode (RAMO), failure to initiate an Airborne Launch Control Center (ALCC)
        Holdoff command (AHC) before a sortie enters radio mode, failure to initiate an AHC
        before unsafing a LF reporting RAMO, or failure to initiate an AHC to a sortie that
        unexpectedly enters RAMO.
        5.3.2.12.2. Failure to enter anti-jam mode and initiate first encrypted inhibit within 2
        minutes from the requirement to accomplish inhibit commands.
        5.3.2.12.3. Failure to command eight inhibits within 8 minutes from requirement to
        accomplish inhibit commands.

        with AFI 91-114.
        5.3.2.12.5. Failure to ensure a site is guarded when required.
        5.3.2.12.6. Failure to declare a security situation or failing to relay correct site or
        location. The MCC is not required to brief location when declaring a security situation
        for unexplained MIIDS alarm when declaring to their primary FSC over SCC line or
        MAF intercom.
        5.3.2.12.7. Allowing a team to depart prior to proper site security system reset (no other
        team on site) when not authorized by applicable security directives.
     5.3.2.13. Failure to inspect all Tamper Detection Indicators (TDIs) on a piece of equipment
     in accordance with Operating Procedures for Rapid Execution and Combat Targeting
     Tamper Detection for the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Force.
  5.3.3. Reference AFGSCI 13-5301v4 for classified critical errors.
5.4. Major Errors. Assess a major error when evaluatee actions result, or would reasonably be
expected to result in, degradation to the operational mission or personnel injury.
  5.4.1. Some examples of major errors are as follows:
     5.4.1.1. Exceeding an asterisked Level A time standard, unless error is listed under
     paragraph 5.3.
     5.4.1.2. Failure to comply with cautions or technical order (T.O.) safety precautions not
     covered by paragraph 5.3.2.1.
     5.4.1.3. Failure to maintain optimum or established system configuration resulting in a
     mission degradation or degradation to a redundant system or that delays accomplishment of
     non-time-critical mission requirements.
     5.4.1.4. Failure to verify equipment configuration and/or operability upon return from
     maintenance or testing. This also includes failure to accomplish daily inspections or
     verifications.
32                                                 AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013

     5.4.1.5. Failure to report a change in system status or correct change in system status,
     systems capability, or operations capability that has degraded the operational mission.
     5.4.1.6. Failure to ensure security measures are accomplished.
       5.4.1.6.1. Physical Security. An example includes failing to report indications of
       improper Sensitive Command Network Test (SCNT) results.
       5.4.1.6.2. Communications Security (COMSEC). Examples include losing control of
       COMSEC materials, compromise or possible compromise of COMSEC materials, and
       failure to report compromise to a responsible agency.
       5.4.1.6.3. Information Security (INFOSEC) and Operations Security (OPSEC).
       Examples include loss of control of classified and passing classified information over an

     5.4.1.7. Failure to accomplish an operational report within established time limits or
     submitting an incorrect operations report.
     5.4.1.8. Failure to note or report indications of mission degradation or degradation to a
     redundant system not listed in paragraph 5.3.2.3. This includes failure to accomplish
     required corrective actions.
     5.4.1.9. Incorrectly configuring any EWO communication equipment to include monitoring
     or directing another LCC to monitor an incorrect satellite, frequency, channel/priority or
     antenna steering.
       5.4.1.9.1. This also includes incorrectly configuring or failure to monitor Ultra High
       Frequency (UHF) voice EWO frequency when required in accordance with applicable
       directives.
     5.4.1.10. Failure to notify SCP or Controlling LCC (CLCC) of a requirement to reassign
     PLC/ENABLE assignment or assigning another LCC to configure for incorrect
     PLC/ENABLE assignment.
     5.4.1.11. Improperly configuring or failing to configure a sortie, and the result does not
     warrant a critical error.
     5.4.1.12. Declaration of incorrect security situation number, letter or indications. If the
     crew corrects the declaration prior to Level A TEPS expiration, a minor error is warranted.
     5.4.1.13. Failure to obtain authentications or a Visitor Control Number (VCN) when
     required.

     5.4.1.18. Failure to inspect or verify the integrity of a TDI.
        5.4.1.18.1. This only applies for failing to inspect one TDI on a piece of equipment. If
        all TDIs on a single piece of equipment were not inspected, a critical error for violation
        of WSSRs is warranted.
     5.4.1.19. Incorrectly posting pages to technical orders in sections III, IV, or V in
     accordance with the A-page of the following technical orders, as applicable. Posting refers
     to the order and sequence of T.O. pages, not annotations or other administrative

     5.4.1.21. Any action that results in damage to equipment which does not meet the criteria
     of a critical error.
     5.4.1.22. Evaluators may assess a major error when evaluatees demonstrated a significant
     lack of knowledge/proficiency when processing a procedural task(s). The Chief, ICBM
     Standardization and Evaluation must approve the major error for lack of
     knowledge/proficiency.
  5.4.2. Reference AFGSCI 13-5301v4 for classified major errors.
5.5. Minor Errors. Assess a minor error for any procedural error, omission, or deficiency which
is not significant enough to meet critical or major error criteria.
  5.5.1. Minor errors will be assessed regardless of operational impact.
  5.5.2. Evaluators may assess a minor error for lack of knowledge/proficiency when evaluatees
  display a lack of knowledge on a procedural task that is not significant enough to meet critical
  or major error criteria.
  5.5.3. Reference AFGSCI 13-5301v4 for classified minor errors.
5.6. Evaluation Documentation. Evaluation documentation provides a means to identify trends,
track individual performance, provides performance feedback to the individual’s supervisor and
serves as a key feedback and training program tool.
  5.6.1. AFGSC Form 95, Evaluation Report – REACT will be used for each evaluated
  individual to document details of administered evaluations and observations. An electronic
  version of the AFGSC Form 95 generated from training and evaluation databases may be
  developed and used with AFGSC/A3TV approval.
     5.6.1.1. In addition to evaluator and evaluatee information, the following information must
     be included on the evaluation report:
34                                              AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013

     5.6.1.1.1. Evaluation details. Evaluation date, location, ACP/SCP/PLCC qualification of
     crew and no-notice applicability must be annotated.
     5.6.1.1.2. All errors will be documented. Errors will be documented against the task or
     subtask for which the error is attributed.
       5.6.1.1.2.1. If a crew member recognizes the status change but fails to perform a
       required task or subtask, document the error against the task or subtask that should
       have been performed.
       5.6.1.1.2.2. If a crew member recognizes the status change but performs the wrong
       task or subtask, document the error against the task or subtask that should have been
       performed. However, give credit to the task or subtask that was performed.
       5.6.1.1.2.3. If a crew member does not recognize a status change and a resulting task
       or subtask requirement, document the error against the required task or subtask that
       should have been accomplished.
       5.6.1.1.2.4. When the task or subtask being performed directs transition to another
       task or subtask and the evaluatee fails to perform the subsequent task or subtask or
       fails to identify the requirement to transition, document the error against the task or
       subtask that directed the transition.
       5.6.1.1.2.5. If a crew member performs an unnecessary task or subtask, which causes
       or results in an error, document the error against the unnecessary task or subtask
       being performed.
       5.6.1.1.2.6. Error descriptions on the evaluation report will be unclassified. OGV
       will coordinate with the Operations Support Squadron (OSS) to maintain a separate
       log for classified evaluation error descriptions.
     5.6.1.1.3. The evaluation report must identify the script presented and evaluators will list
     all JPRs credited during the conduct of each evaluation.
       5.6.1.1.3.1. A crewmember will receive credit for a JPR by performing any portion of
       a task, regardless if a checklist is used or if all actions are contained within another
       checklist.
       5.6.1.1.3.2. Evaluators awarding JPR credit are documenting the crew was exposed to
       a portion of the task.
       5.6.1.1.3.3. Evaluation reports developed by OGV following HHQ evaluations will
       only list JPRs for which errors are written against.
     5.6.1.1.4. Pre- and Post-Delinquency date information will be listed on the evaluation
     report even if there is no change.
     5.6.1.1.5. SQ/DO or higher authority must document decisions about corrective actions,
     restricted status, and/or subsequent evaluations as a result of the evaluation.
     5.6.1.1.6. An evaluation type must be listed for each individual. Evaluation types may
     be different for each individual on the report. Evaluations must be annotated as a no-
     notice evaluation as applicable.
AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  35

  5.6.2. Following HHQ administered evaluations, HHQ evaluators or inspectors will provide
  evaluation paperwork in writing to the unit identifying the rating, type of evaluation, errors
  and JPRs in which errors were assessed. OGV will create and coordinate an evaluation report
  to be maintained for documentation purposes.
  5.6.3. Evaluation reports will be maintained in the Individual Qualification Folder (IQF) for
  each evaluatee.
     5.6.3.1. When retraining is required, the appropriate OSS training office must receive
     copies of the evaluation report for training purposes.
        5.6.3.1.1. Once training is completed, the appropriate agencies will document the
        accomplishment of training on the evaluation report.
     5.6.3.2. The evaluation report will be coordinated through all appropriate agencies to
     ensure all evaluatee records are kept current.
     5.6.3.3. Individual records must maintain all restriction-related paperwork to include
     evaluation reports, restriction letters, letters for removal from restricted status, and training
     documentation.
5.7. Evaluation Ratings. Overall evaluation performances are rated by qualification levels.
  5.7.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q1) indicates an evaluatee demonstrated the desired level of
  performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within prescribed
  tolerances.
     5.7.1.1. Criteria for a Q1 rating consist of no critical or major errors and three or fewer
     minor errors.
  5.7.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q2) indicates an evaluatee demonstrated the ability to perform
  duties safely, but may need additional training at the discretion of the squadron commander or
  operations officer.
     5.7.2.1. Criteria for a Q2 rating consist of no critical errors, two or fewer major errors or
     four or more minor errors.
     5.7.2.2. The level of training and other corrective actions for any errors (briefing, formal
     training or evaluation) and possible restriction for the evaluatee will be determined by the
     squadron commander or operations officer.
  5.7.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q3) indicates an evaluatee is unqualified based on an
  unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge.
     5.7.3.1. Criteria for a Q3 rating consist of one or more critical errors, or three or more
     major errors.
     5.7.3.2. Training will be accomplished for all tasks with major or critical errors. The level
     of training for any errors (briefing or formal training) will be determined by the squadron
     commander or operations officer.
     5.7.3.3. A requalification evaluation including all tasks with major or critical errors is
     required.
36                                                  AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013

       5.7.3.4. The evaluatee is restricted in all positions and may not perform unsupervised
       operations duty until completion of retraining and successful completion of an evaluation
       on all tasks where critical and major errors were committed.
          5.7.3.4.1. Dual position crew members will always be rated unqualified (Q3) for both
          positions if rated Q3 in either position.
     5.7.4. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) indicates an evaluatee demonstrated exceptional
     knowledge and performance above the standard. The goal of the exceptionally qualified
     rating is to recognize an evaluation performance considered to be among the top 15% of all
     evaluations.
       5.7.4.1. To be eligible for nomination, an evaluatee must complete a full-check evaluation
       and receive a Q1 rating with zero errors committed.
       5.7.4.2. Evaluatees will be nominated to receive the EQ designation on the evaluation
       report based on the non-biased discretion of the evaluators.
          5.7.4.2.1. Evaluators will use AFGSC Form 15, REACT EQ Nomination Worksheet for
          eligible evaluatees to determine whether they should be nominated for the EQ
          designation.
          5.7.4.2.2. The AFGSC Form 15 is only required to be completed following evaluations
          for which an individual(s) are nominated for the EQ designation.
       5.7.4.3. An ICBM Senior Evaluator Combat Crew Commander will review EQ nomination
       worksheets and will recommend approval or disapproval to the Chief, ICBM
       Standardization and Evaluation.
       5.7.4.4. The Chief, ICBM Standardization and Evaluation will review the worksheet and
       ICBM Senior Evaluator Combat Crew Commander’s recommendation for final approval or
       disapproval.
          5.7.4.4.1. An EQ rating may be awarded to one or both members of the evaluated crew.
          5.7.4.4.2. EQ ratings are not allowed for special-check evaluations.
       5.7.4.5. 20 AF evaluators may award an EQ following a full HHQ evaluation. Final
       approval for the EQ rests with 20AF/A3NV.
AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                               37


                                           Chapter 6
                                     MISCELLANEOUS


6.1. Operational Performance. When a crew is on alert and procedural deviations or errors are
observed or found through a review of alert prints, logs, or weapon system indications, the
squadron commander or operations officer, Chief, ICBM Standardization and Evaluation, or
OG/CC, as applicable, shall be notified in writing within 3 working days after discovery.
  6.1.1. The TEPS/ETEPS and error definitions in Chapter 5 serve as tools or guides when
  determining corrective action and the individual’s CMR or restricted status.
  6.1.2. If OGV cannot ascertain how to assess a procedural deviation after querying all
  required on-base agencies (EWO Plans Office, Codes, Safety, MMOC, etc.), call and initiate a
  formal request for error determination with 20 AF.
     6.1.2.1. 20 AF will analyze the information passed, make a final determination, and
     respond back to the unit OGV as soon as possible. A copy of the determination must be
     provided to HQ AFGSC/A3I and A3T.
     6.1.2.2. If 20 AF is unable to make a final determination, a formal request for error
     determination must be forwarded to HQ AFGSC/A3I. HQ AFGSC/A3I will coordinate the
     error with HQ AFGSC/A3T. The information will be jointly analyzed and formally
     coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM SMEs (AFGSC/A3I, AFGSC/SE, etc.). Final
     error assessment, error severity as well as operational, training and evaluation impact will
     be determined by the MAJCOM SME. HQ AFGSC/A3I will provide the final
     determination to 20 AF for distribution.
     6.1.2.3. If the outcome of the error determination could result in documentation as a
     restrictable field deviation, affected crew members must not perform unsupervised alert
     duties until the deviation results are finalized.
  6.1.3. Substandard operational performance will not be documented as an evaluation or an
  evaluation error. Therefore, a criticality will not be assigned to the deficiency.
  6.1.4. Deviations meeting the criteria in Chapter 5 and AFGSCI 13-5301v4 as critical, will be
  documented as restrictable and will result in automatic restricted status. Deviations meeting
  major or minor criteria will be documented as non-restrictable.
     6.1.4.1. Although critical, major and minor error ratings will not be used, appropriate
     agencies must understand the severity of the deviations.
     6.1.4.2. Recommendations for restricting may be made to the OG commander or deputy, or
     the squadron commander or operations officer, based on deviation severity or deficiency in
     knowledge, proficiency, or professionalism.
  6.1.5. When a crew’s observed or determined substandard performance would have resulted in
  a "Q3" rating during an evaluation, the crew will be restricted and retrained in all tasks in
  which they were found to be unqualified.
38                                                   AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013

       6.1.5.1. The unit commander or operations officer may determine any additional corrective
       action(s), additional training, evaluation requirements, and any crew force management
       actions as required.
       6.1.5.2. The squadron operations officer or higher authority will determine the level of
       training (briefing or formal training) for restrictable field deviations and will determine any
       training requirements for non-restrictable field deviations.
     6.1.6. Deviations will be documented using the AFGSC Form 96, Procedural Deviation
     Report - REACT, which will be coordinated through all appropriate agencies. An electronic
     version of the AFGSC Form 96 generated from training and evaluation databases may be
     developed and used with AFGSC/A3TV approval.
       6.1.6.1. Procedural deviation reports will be maintained in the IQF for the appropriate
       individual.
       6.1.6.2. The procedural deviation report will be unclassified. OGV will coordinate with
       OSS to maintain a separate log for classified procedural deviation descriptions.
6.2. AFGSC Crew Member Excellence (CME) Award. This award recognizes MCCMs who
have sustained an excellent record of evaluation performances and overall performance while a
crew member within AFGSC.
     6.2.1. To be eligible for the CME Award, an individual must achieve a minimum of five Q1
     evaluation ratings out of a series of six full-check evaluations. The only exception is for
     individuals who have received an EQ rating, at which point the individual must achieve a
     minimum of four Q1 evaluation ratings (with at least one EQ) out of a maximum of five
     consecutive evaluations.
       6.2.1.1. Evaluations must be full-check evaluations to count toward CME eligibility.
       6.2.1.2. An individual must not have a Q3 rating on a special-check or full-check
       evaluation. A Q3 will automatically reset the CME eligibility count.
       6.2.1.3. A restrictable field deviation will automatically reset an individual’s CME
       eligibility count.
       6.2.1.4. At least one of the evaluations must be taken as an MCCC.
     6.2.2. The OG commander is the final approval authority for the CME Award. The OG
     commander will review the nomination letter forwarded by the respective squadron
     commander and will consider the individual’s overall performance as a crew member when
     approving selected individuals for the CME Award.
     6.2.3. Approved individuals will receive an AFGSC Crew Member Excellence certificate
     (AFGSC Form 56) recognizing their evaluation performances.
6.3. New or Upgrade System Requirements. For new or upgraded missile systems, the unit
standardization and evaluation office will develop the evaluation program to meet requirements
within this instruction, AFGSCI 13-5301v3, AFGSCI 36-283, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile
Training System Management, and AFGSCI 10-604, Global Strike Operational Weapon Systems
Management.
AFGSCI 13-5301V2 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                           39

  6.3.1. The unit standardization and evaluation office will develop specific requirements for
  planning a new evaluation program to include a validation plan and program approval
  strategy.
  6.3.2. The unit commander will appoint a limited number of SMEs in writing. The primary
  duty of the SME is to develop technical documentation, evaluation materials, and to conduct
  CMR evaluations.
    6.3.2.1. Document SME appointment on the individual’s AFGSC Form 91. Forward the
    SME designation memorandum through the chain of command directly to HQ
    AFGSC/A3T and 20 AF.
  6.3.3. SMEs who conduct CMR evaluations or initial [post-Initial Operational Capacity
  (IOC)] system operations must be CMR certified. To maintain CMR status, they must be
  evaluated on all applicable tasks or complete a qualification evaluation within 60 calendar
  days of removal from SME status or within 90 calendar days from system IOC (whichever is
  sooner).
    6.3.3.1. Once evaluations are complete and individual is certified, document certification
    on the AFGSC Form 91.
  6.3.4. MCCMs trained by the SMEs will be evaluated within 90 calendar days from system
  IOC.
