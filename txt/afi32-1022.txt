                                              Chapter 1

                                             OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is to provide instruction and guidance for those
responsible for planning, developing, and submitting nonappropriated fund (NAF) projects to approving
authorities in compliance with public law as well as Department of Defense (DoD), and Air Force
Instructions. Nonappropriated fund projects are funded with monies not appropriated by Congress such
as private donations, Army and Air Force Exchange (AAFES) dividends, Defense Commissary Agency
(DeCA) surcharges, and revenue generated from Services MWR or lodging activities.
1.2. Principles.
    1.2.1. Project Planning. Project planning identifies projects needed to satisfy current and future
    Air Force Services and Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) program requirements and
    determines the facilities required and the most economical means of fulfilling those requirements.
    This determination shall always include evaluating whether to construct new, add to and alter,
    renovate, or repair the needed facilities.
    1.2.2. Project Programming. NAF programming is the process of acquiring both the
    approval/authority and funding/resources necessary to perform the planned work.
1.3. Responsibilities.
    1.3.1. Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Installations), SAF/IEI. Provides Air Force
    policy and oversight for the planning, programming, and execution of maintenance, repair, and
    construction programs for NAF facilities and recreation sites, and approves certain waivers.
    1.3.2. The Civil Engineer (AF/A7C). AF/A7C provides programming guidance, oversight, and
    policy as required. AF/A7C develops policy and oversees execution of NAF facility projects.
    AF/A7C obtains waivers and exceptions to fund sources and space criteria, and coordinates approval
    of less than 10 percent of scope or less than 125 percent of cost variances. AF/A7CP prepares the
    NAF Construction Report to Congress and submits it through the Secretary of the Air Force to the
    Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). AF/A7CP manages the programming and execution of
    the AF NAF construction program and is a member of the Air Force Services Council. AF/A7CP
    provides policy, guidance and direction to the MAJCOMs and the Design and Construction Agents
    (DA/CA) for executing the construction programs it manages.
    1.3.3. Director of Services (AF/A1S). Develops policy and facility programs sourced by NAF
    consistent with Air Force Facility Standards. Advocates resource allocation and programs and
    exercises oversight over approved funding to ensure use is in accordance with authorized parameters
    of the annual Air Force-wide NAF construction program. AF/A1S provides oversight through trend
    analyses and policy revisions. The Director of Services contributes to readiness and improves
    productivity through programs promoting fitness, esprit de corps, and quality of life for AF people.
    The directorate provides policy and direction for worldwide Services programs which includes
    fitness, peacetime and wartime feeding, lodging, libraries, mortuary, child development and youth
    programs, a wide array of recreation and revenue producing MWR activities like golf, bowling and
    clubs. AF/A1S is a member of the Air Force Services Council.
    1.3.4. Major Commands (MAJCOMs). MAJCOMs provide oversight to ensure compliance with
    law and DoD and Air Force policies. MAJCOMs must review project documentation for accuracy
    prior to submission to the Air Force Services Agency (AFSVA) and AF/A7C. MAJCOMs are
AFI32-1022    20 MAY 2009                                                                             5


  responsible for establishing quality standards; providing command-unique guidance to supplement
  Air Force policies, procedures, and instructions; validating requirements identified by their
  installations; developing and advocating command budgets for Sustainment, Restoration and
  Modernization (SRM) projects; promoting timely obligation of funds and project approval within
  delegated approval authorities; and ensuring installation compliance with this AFI. The ANG and
  AFRC Civil Engineer perform these MAJCOM functions for their installations.
  1.3.5. Air Force Manpower, Personnel, and Services (AF/A1). AF/A1 serves as the senior Air
  Force representative to the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) Board of Directors and
  is the final Air Force reviewer of AAFES project viability packages submitted for Air Force project
  viability confirmation.
  1.3.6. Air Force Services Agency (AFSVA). AFSVA administers and controls NAF project
  funding; implements AF Services policy on NAF capital requirements; ensures validation of market
  demand and financial viability for proposed NAF projects; provides functional design oversight
  assistance and guidance to bases, MAJCOMs, and A7CP related to the execution of AF Services
  projects; and coordinates the planning and programming of AF funded NAF projects.
  1.3.7. Installation Commander. The Installation Commander has overall responsibility and
  accountability for the operation of an Air Force installation. The Installation Commander, assisted
  by the Civil Engineer Squadron Commander, is responsible and accountable to ensure all work
  accomplished for the Air Force on Air Force owned/controlled real property is properly authorized
  and funded in accordance with all laws, policies, and regulations. The Installation Commander is
  also responsible for ensuring the effective and efficient use of Air Force real property; and planning
  and programming all NAF-funded unspecified minor military construction and maintenance and
  repair for real property requirements necessary to properly support assigned missions and people
  (including tenants) and to care for and preserve Air Force real property. See AFI 32-9005, Real
  Property Accountability and Reporting, and paragraph 1.2.8 of AFI 34-205, Services
  Nonappropriated Fund Facility Projects, for additional information.
  1.3.8. ANG and AFRC Installations and Services Facilities. The ANG and AFRC should rely on
  local community programs and facilities for Services activities and other community support to the
  maximum extent possible. The ANG and AFRC should provide only activities where there is
  significant demand not addressed locally which may include sports fields and courts; dining hall;
  lodging; physical fitness; multipurpose recreation; sports and recreation equipment checkout
  activity; and consolidated club that offers an on-site feeding capability.
     1.3.8.1. Services Activities Already in Operation. The ANG and AFRC may continue to
     operate other Services activities that were operating as of September 30, 1991, as long as funding
     is adequate and they do not inhibit the operation of other programs with significant demand.
     1.3.8.2. Other Community Support Activities. Limited exchange facilities are authorized.
     The size of these facilities and the scope of operation are based on the military population
     supported, and accessibility of active duty exchange facilities. The exchange service must also
     demonstrate the cost benefit of these activities. Commissaries are not authorized unless special
     circumstances warrant.
     1.3.8.3. Adding New Services Activities. The ANG and AFRC may add new activities when
     justified by patron analysis and approved by the Air Staff functional manager. AF/A1S is the
     approval authority for adding new Services NAF programs.

                                               Chapter 2

                       PLANNING NONAPPRORIATED FUND PROJECTS

2.1. Nonappropriated Fund Projects. Nonappropriated funds provide facilities that improve the
morale and welfare of Air Force personnel and family members by providing enhanced recreation,
services, and resale activities and programs that are not authorized for construction with congressionally
appropriated funds. Nonappropriated fund projects are funded with monies not appropriated by
Congress such as private donations, Army and Air Force Exchange (AAFES) dividends, Defense
Commissary Agency (DeCA) surcharges, and revenue generated from Services MWR or lodging
activities.
2.2. Planning Actions. Effective planning establishes project requirements and proposes the most
effective and economical means of satisfying those requirements. The process described in this
paragraph does not apply to AAFES project planning.
   2.2.1. Determine Requirement. Installations identify programs that promote fitness, esprit de
   corps, and quality of life for AF people and the facilities needed for them. Installation Commanders
   review, validate, and prioritize these needs.
   2.2.2. Evaluate Alternative Solutions. Installations evaluate existing assets and determine the
   most beneficial and cost effective programs promoting fitness, esprit de corps, and quality of life for
   AF personnel. Services is the OPR for conducting a financial analysis IAW AFI 34-205, Services
   Nonappropriated Fund Facility Projects. For NAF facility projects costing $200,000 or more,
   MAJCOM or AFSVA conducts a Project Validation Assessment (PVA) in accordance with AFI 34-
   205.
   2.2.3. Initiate Programming Actions. When it is determined a facility project is required, the Civil
   Engineer Squadron will prepare appropriate documentation for approval (see Atch 3), and enter the
   project into the Automated Civil Engineering System – Project Management module (ACES-PM).
   Documentation (typically obtained from facility users) shall include a fully justified case for
   accomplishing the project. Definitions of the terms used to identify project costs (funded, unfunded,
   excluded) are defined in Attachment 1.
   2.2.4. AF MWR Project Submission. Details on Air Force MWR project submission, validation,
   and funding are provided in AFI 34-205. Projects competing for Air Force central NAF funds are
   submitted to AFSVA in response to the annual call for MAJCOMs to submit projects. Projects are
   submitted by the MAJCOM/A1S and must have a completed DD Form 1391, FY ____ Military
   Construction Project Data, and an Internal Needs Validation Study (INVS). An Air Force NAF
   Facilities Panel, chaired by AFSVA, reviews submissions and selects projects that are competitive
   for funding. AFSVA funds a Project Validation Assessment (PVA) for these selected projects.
   Based on the PVA results, projects may be further selected by the NAF Facilities Panel to proceed to
   35% design or higher. The NAF Facility Panel reviews projects at the 35% or higher design stage
   for inclusion in the annual submission to OSD(P&R). Projects approved by OSD(P&R) and
   reported to Congress proceed to 100% design and are prepared for construction contract award.
2.3. Certificate of Compliance. For construction projects, installations ensure planning actions are
accomplished by completing a Certificate of Compliance for Critical Planning Actions document (see
Atch 3 for project documentation requirements). See AFI 32-1021 Planning and Programming Military
Construction (MILCON) Projects, for details on the certificate.

2.4. Project Validation Assessment (PVA). A PVA must validate all NAF maintenance, repair, and
construction projects costing $200,000 and greater. See AFI 34-205, Services Nonappropriated Fund
Facility Projects, for additional guidance. The Installation Commander, MAJCOM/A1S, and
MAJCOM/A7C staffs working with AFSVA must ensure a PVA is accomplished when appropriate,
prior to finalizing the scope, functional layout, and cost of the NAF Services facility. A PVA is the
process used to formally collect data, document facts, determine projected demand, and analyze results
to help make a decision. It verifies customer demand, analyzes site and collocation possibilities, and
calculates financial viability "payback." A PVA considers alternatives, weighs new construction versus
addition or alteration, proposes acquisition resources and methods (such as design-build, design-bid-
build, etc.) and analyzes competition to determine project requirements. These studies can be
accomplished under an open-ended contract with AFSVA. The exception to this requirement is NAF
facility projects funded with APFs; these do not require a PVA.
2.5.     Facilities.  Facilities should be consistent with the Base General Plan, and with
installation/MAJCOM policies. Use of pre-engineered buildings is encouraged when they can reduce
costs. When used in non-industrial areas, they should include exterior cladding to allow them to blend
with other nearby structures and they should meet installation architectural, safety, and Anti Terrorism
and Force Protection (AT/FP) requirements. Reference AFH 32-1084, Facility Requirements, and
AF/A7C approved design guides for space criteria. Design and space criteria waivers are submitted to
AF/A7CP for Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Installations) and AF/A1S consideration.
Reference AFH 32-1084 for specific waiver guidance.
2.6. Site Considerations. The site refers to the portion of land adequately sized to contain the facility
and related functions. The site includes area for landscaping, parking, and essential open and buffer
areas, e.g. AT/FP standoff. The building 5-foot line does not establish site boundaries. Site boundaries
are established as boundary encompassing facility footprint, paved walkways and parking areas,
essential open or buffer zones and, AT/FP standoff areas. Make sure the site is consistent with the Base
General Plan (see AFI 32-7062, Air Force Comprehensive Planning, for details) and agrees with the
PVA recommendation. AFSVA/SVX must approve any site changes after the PVA validation.
    2.6.1. Site Clearance. Strive to provide a clean site for the construction of a NAF facility; APFs
    should be used for this purpose. A clean site is defined as a site free from any man-made conditions
    or structures such as buried underground storage tanks and utilities that interfere with the facility
    construction. The demolition of existing manmade structures both above and below ground in
    conjunction with the construction of a NAF facility must be accomplished with APFs and
    programmed as an APF companion project. APFs are the appropriate fund source for archeological
    and ammunition clearances, removal/relocation of structures (including inactive utility lines), old
    foundations, underground storage tanks, and buried debris/waste. This applies whether the existence
    of these items is known in advance or is discovered during construction. In the case of active utility
    lines or structures, their relocation is considered a NAF cost unless the active line was not properly
    identified. If an active utility line is found on site after the project has been reported to Congress,
    APFs are the appropriate fund source for the relocation of the utility.
       2.6.1.1. If the cost of the clean site requirements, which includes site investigation costs,
       exceeds 15% of the NAF project cost or $750K, whichever is less, APFs must be approved by
       AF/A7C. The approval package should include a DD Form 1391, site plan showing the location
       of all sites considered, and a detailed analysis that includes a strong justification for the site’s
       selection.
AFI32-1022    20 MAY 2009                                                                            9


  2.6.2. Building Disposal. Dispose of older substandard facilities as new structures are built.
  Follow AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property, for disposal action guidance. If the installation is
  not going to dispose of the building, the installation must ensure the DD Form 1391 and DD Form
  1391c, FY ____ Military Construction Project Data (Continuation,) provide clear justification for
  retention. If an existing facility is identified for disposal during the approval process, and an Air
  Force centrally funded project is approved to replace the facility, AF/A1S must approve the
  continued use of the facility for a NAF activity. The Civil Engineer Squadron Commander is
  responsible for programming facility disposal or reuse in accordance with AF/A7C policy of zero
  footprint growth and AFI 32-9004.

                        PROGRAMMING NONAPPROPRIATED FUND PROJECTS

3.1. Fund Sources for NAF Projects. Facility categories are a primary factor in determining the
proper fund source for NAF projects. Use Tables 3.1 through 3.6 to determine the facility category and
fund source. The three identifiable categories or groupings of MWR facilities are Category-A: Mission
Sustaining Activities; Category-B: Basic Community Support Activities; and Category-C: Revenue
Generating Activities. In addition there are lodging facilities as a separate non-MWR category. A
discussion of each follows:
     3.1.1. Category A − Mission Sustaining Activities. These programs promote the physical and
     mental well being of military personnel. They are required to support the basic military mission and
     are funded with APFs. Restrict use of NAFs to specific instances where the law or policy limits
     APFs. Programs in this category have virtually no capacity for generating NAF revenues. Table 3.1
     shows the fund source for this category and type of the facilities:

NOTES:
1. Use of NAFs for construction requires an OSD(P&R) waiver to fund source.
2. Use of NAFs for maintenance and repair requires a waiver to fund source from SAF/FMCEB. Send requests to
USAF/A7CP for staffing through appropriate offices for SAF/FMCEB.
3. For environmental compliance work, coordinate with base/MAJCOM environmental offices to determine proper source of
funding. SAF/FM will not consider a request for a waiver to the environmental compliance construction fund source.
4. Fund playing courts and fields with APFs, if most of the following conditions exist: a.) They are the only ones on base
(i.e., a small installation); b.) Attached to the gym; c.) Detached from the gym, but operated by the gym staff; d.) Reserved
for only military personnel during peak use times, e.g., noon hour; e.) Located in the dormitory area for use by active duty
military personnel; and f.) Periodically closed to open play to host intramural or varsity-type tournaments.

1.    Category A Skateboard Parks: if constructed within an existing park and picnic area, then APFs are the proper fund
     source, if constructed as a stand-alone facility (indoor or outdoor) or as part of youth center, then it’s classified as a
     Category B facility and NAFs are the proper fund source.
AFI32-1022           20 MAY 2009                                                                                                11


    3.1.2. Category B − Basic Community Support Activities. These programs support the military
    mission by satisfying the basic physiological and psychological needs of military members and their
    families. They provide community support systems for the mobile military population. These
    programs differ from those in Category A, in part, because of their limited ability to generate NAF
    revenues. Approved remote and isolated locations have additional Category B APF support; see
    Paragraph 3.9, and Attachment 2-Paragraph 2.3 for details.

NOTES:
1. OSD(P&R) must approve a waiver to fund source if the construction fund source shown is not used. AF/A7CP routes
waiver requests to SAF/FMCEB to use NAFs for maintenance and repair.

2. Includes the reconfiguration of a facility, e.g., the addition, rearrangement, or removal of non load-bearing walls,
modification of HVAC, electrical, or other systems/components to restore a building to functional standards, i.e., to make a
facility fully functional and capable of supporting activities and programs effectively and efficiently. Includes maintenance
and repair of bowling lanes and pinsetters at remote and isolated and Category B bowling centers. Per AFI 65-106, addition,
rearrangement, or removal of non load-bearing walls is subject to availability of APFs; no SAF/FM waiver to fund source is
required to use NAFs.
3. Except for Child Development Centers and Youth Facilities Overseas, use NAFs for all construction environmental
compliance. Use non-environmental quality APFs for all maintenance and repair environmental compliance requirements.
SAF/FM will not consider a waiver request to the environmental compliance construction class.

4. Fund construction of playing courts and fields with NAFs if most of the following conditions exist: a.) Part of a NAF
youth center program. b.) For primary use by residents (not particularly military). c.) Not operated as part of the gym
program. d.) Do not offer special times for military preference.

5. Category A Skateboard Parks: if constructed within an existing park and picnic area APFs are the proper fund source, if
constructed as a stand-alone facility (indoor or outdoor) or as part of youth center, then it’s classified as a Category B facility
and NAFs are the proper fund source.
6. Use APFs for construction, maintenance and repair of youth facilities (youth centers, courts, and playing fields) at
overseas locations.

     3.1.3. Category C − Revenue Generating Activities. These programs provide recreational and
     resale activities that benefit military morale. They foster community spirit and provide alternatives
     for off-duty pursuits. These programs have the greatest capability of generating NAF revenues and
     fund most of their expenses.

NOTES:

1. Do not use APFs in Category C facilities for rearrangement or removal of non load-bearing walls to restore a building to
functional standards, i.e., to make an existing building fully functional and capable of supporting Category C activities or
programs effectively and efficiently. NAF must fund this work.
2. Use NAFs for the maintenance and repair of functionally unique items required to support activity operations. These
items make the facility usable for the activity it contains, but are not considered part of the normal facility system. See
Attachment 2 for examples.
3. For Remote and Isolated Locations: APFs are authorized for Category C functionally unique items required to support
activity operations (see Paragraph 3.9).
4. APFs shall be used outside the United States.

NOTES:
1. Category C (R&I) means Remote and Isolated Locations.
2. When NAF is the fund source, reimburse work performed by the Civil Engineer Squadron with NAFs.
3. Waivers to fund source not authorized. Report all APFs as direct costs.
4. When a leak is a threat to the environment, detection is an AAFES responsibility. Repair/cleanup is covered by
environmental APF funds when an upgrade is required to meet new environmental standards. However, if there is also an
increase in capacity, the portion attributed to the capacity increase will become an AAFES responsibility.
      3.1.4. Lodging Fund Programming. Although not a separate MWR category, lodging facility
      fund sources have specialized funding considerations. Lodging facilities, except for temporary
      lodging facilities, use the same APF source as Category A activities. APFs are the appropriate fund
      source for environmental compliance. AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare
      and Recreation (MWR) and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIs), provides funding
      source guidance for all associated expenditures. Submit waiver requests for specific cases to
      SAF/FMCEB for consideration.

NOTES:

1. The funds shown above are private funds. Do not use APFs or Services NAFs to fund construction of or relocation of
private organizations. See note 3.

2. See DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 5, Chap 34 for details on APF support for overseas banks/automatic teller machines (ATMs).

3. If the Thrift Shop occupies a Government-owned building, use APFs to maintain and repair the structural integrity and
systems of the facility and to comply with environmental requirements. Regular maintenance and repair of the shop should
be funded by the private organization itself. Fund functionally unique items to support activity operations with private funds.
See Attachment 2 for examples of functionally unique items.

4. The National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB is authorized APFs for construction.

5. For additional funding guidance on museums, see AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force, AFI 65-601 Vol
1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, and AFI 84-103, U.S. Air Force Heritage Program.


3.2. Waiver to Fund Source. The tables in the beginning of this chapter prescribe a single funding
source for all construction regardless of cost; however, occasionally unique situations or exigencies may
require deviation or exception to the basic funding policy. Except as noted below, authority to waive the
fund source remains with the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, Personnel and Readiness or
PDUSD(P&R). Installation and MAJCOM staffs must completely justify requests for waiver, regardless
of cost. AF/A7C, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Installations), and Office of OSD(P&R)
will review these requests on a case-by-case basis. Support requests with the same programming
documentation required for project approval. Installation and MAJCOM staffs must make sure funds
are available for the project and are authorized by the funding authority. Include this information in the
waiver request. Show how and why the waiver is in the best interest of the Air Force. In a limited
number of instances, construction may be funded using more than one source.
      3.2.1. Nonappropriated Funding for Projects Normally Funded with APFs. With the exception
      of facilities in support of TDY travel and OCONUS youth center, youth courts, and youth playing
      fields, OSD(P&R) establishes the waiver policy to use NAF in lieu of APFs.
         3.2.1.1. Waivers for TDY and OCONUS Youth Facilities. For TDY facilities in support of
         TDY travel (VQs) and for OCONUS youth centers, youth courts, and youth playing fields,
         SAF/FMB may approve the use of NAF funding when APFs are certified as unavailable. To
         obtain this certification the MAJCOM must satisfy the following criteria: (1) the installation
         submitted the project to the MAJCOM for consideration in its Military Construction (MILCON)
         (major and minor construction) or APF modernization budget; (2) the project was not prioritized
         high enough to be funded within the MAJCOM’s TOA for any APF source; (3) the MAJCOM
         certifies that the project is of higher priority than all other non-funded NAF construction and
         modernization requirements. Waiver requests should be submitted thru AFSVA to AF/A1S,
         SAF/IEI and SAF/FMCEB for funding consideration before submittal to SAF/FMB for approval.
         The waiver request must include certification that the project meets all three criteria.
16                                                                          AFI32-1022      20 MAY 2009


3.3. Appropriated Funding for NAF Facility Requirements. APFs are the appropriate fund source
for facility requirements supporting NAF activities that are driven by large restationing actions, facility
relocation for the convenience of the Government, constructing facilities denied by country-to-country
agreements, or if a facility is destroyed by an act of God, by fire, or by terrorism. In these cases,
appropriated funds are the appropriate fund source for both minor and major construction. Do not use
APF, MWR, or Lodging funds to construct or relocate facilities for private organizations.
     3.3.1. Establishing, Activating, and Expanding a Military Installation. An expansion must be a
     major increase in authorized and assigned personnel strength over a short period of time. As a
     minimum, a 25 percent increase in assigned personnel over two years satisfies the criteria. A 25
     percent increase resulting from evolutionary expansion over more than two years would not qualify.
     3.3.2. Relocating Facilities for the Convenience of the Government. When a military
     construction project displaces a NAF activity (to include any Category B or C facility, regardless of
     original fund source), the installation must include the costs of removal, relocation, or construction
     of a replacement for the NAF facility in the military construction DD Form 1391 documentation.
     Replacement facilities could include either newly constructed facilities or alteration of existing
     buildings. Examples are: installation-initiated consolidations or traffic circulation issues. Another
     example would be the requirement to move facilities out of the Clear Zone/Accident Potential Zone
     (CZ/APZ).
     3.3.3. Constructing NAF Facilities Denied by Country-to-Country Agreements. Replacement
     of facilities denied by country-to-country agreements should be submitted for APF consideration.
     3.3.4. Facilities Destroyed by Acts of God, Fire, or Terrorism. The following sections detail the
     conditions under which it is appropriate to fund NAF projects using APFs rather than NAFs.
        3.3.4.1. Flooding and Acts of God. If an act of God damages or destroys facilities or grounds,
        APFs are the appropriate fund source to program repair or replacement projects. For example, if
        a facility sustains storm damage, whether in or out of a floodplain, it would be considered an act
        of God. In the case of flooding, this refers to levels that exceed the 100-year flood as defined by
        the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and where the location is not currently
        identified as a flood hazard area, refer to the. Additional guidance for golf courses is provided in
        para 4.5.4. Flood damage from lesser events such as seasonal flooding or erosion would not be
        considered an act of God. However, if flooding is widespread, e.g. flooding that impacts several
        different facilities on base, then it may be considered for APFs to restore the damage. See
        Attachment 1 for definition of terms.
        3.3.4.2. Facilities Destroyed by Fire or Acts of Terrorism. NAF facilities damaged or
        destroyed by fire or acts of terrorism are eligible for repair/replacement with APF funding.
        Fires caused by NAF employee negligence is a NAF responsibility.
     3.3.5. Utility Runs. Public Law authorizes the use of APFs to expand or extend utilities from the
     base system to connect to the site boundaries or nearest manhole, whichever is closest to the facility
     under construction. An exception that would not qualify for appropriated funding is long utility runs
     solely for the irrigation of golf courses.
3.4. Mixing Nonappropriated and Appropriated Fund Construction Funds. Fund all construction
elements from a single fund source--NAFs or APFs, but not a combination of both. It may be acceptable
to co-locate certain APF activities in a NAF facility, for example: a military clothing sales store in a
base exchange, medical pharmacy in a base exchange, or excessive utility runs and roads from the base
system to the site boundary (see Paragraph 3.3.5.). The same is true for locating NAF activities in an
AFI32-1022      20 MAY 2009                                                                              17


APF facility, for example, a NAF coffee shop in a base library. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the
Air Force (Installations) must approve the use of APFs in a NAF facility and/or NAFs in an APF
facility, regardless of cost.
3.5. Host Nation Credits. Host nation credits are entitlements to the US Air Force from the host nation
as goods and services (not money) under a memorandum of understanding executed by the MAJCOM
on behalf of the DoD and the host nation. The installation may fund facility requirements (maintenance,
repair, and construction), normally funded with nonappropriated and appropriated funds with host nation
credits if the installation applies all policies, rules, and procedures that apply to NAF and APF projects.
3.6. Companion APF and NAF Projects. Combining APF maintenance and repair with a NAF
maintenance and repair or NAF construction project is not a mix of funds. However, make sure that
work is properly classified as construction or repair in the contract documents and drawings. Title 10
USC 2492 authorizes the establishment of contracts or agreements between NAFIs and APF
organizations that may serve as a vehicle to provide and obtain goods and/or services. Submit separate
NAF documents and APF documents to the proper approval authority. See Paragraph 4.5 to view details
on maintenance and repair, and Table 6.2 for maintenance and repair approval levels. See AFI 32-1032,
Planning and Programming Appropriated Funded Maintenance, Repair and Construction Projects, for
details on repair. Comply with the following:
   3.6.1. Separate Schedules. The installation and the NAF activity must make sure there are separate
   contract, work, and payment schedules for each funding source. These schedules must identify the
   various elements of work in each category (construction or repair) and include the costs for each
   element. The installation must explain the separate work (cost accounting) schedules for APF and
   NAF funds in the invitation for bids, include them in the bid submittal, and incorporate them into the
   resulting contract. A memorandum of agreement can be used to allow work to be initially
   accomplished entirely using one fund source provided the schedules are sufficiently separated to
   allow appropriate reimbursement.
   3.6.2. Separate Categories of Work. The base must clearly identify the separate categories of
   work in the contract drawings. For all contract change orders, the installation must identify changes
   against the applicable work schedules and compute and fund the costs accordingly.
3.7. Life Safety Code Compliance Deficiencies. Under the definition of repair (see AFI 32-1032), use
APFs to rectify fire or other life, occupational safety and health code deficiencies, to include provision
of handicap access (Americans with Disabilities Act), fire protection (e.g., fire extinguishers, sprinklers,
and alarm systems), and security protection (e.g., alarm systems), asbestos abatement, lead-based paint
removal, and seismic correction in existing facilities for all categories (A, B, and C). Security and alarm
systems should follow guidelines set out in the Base General Plan and repair or construction work
should meet required Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) standards, current National Fire Protection
Association (NFPA) standards, Occupational Safety & Health Administration standards and AFI 32-
2001 Fire Emergency Services.
3.8. Security and Antiterrorism Force Protection (AT/FP) Requirements. AT/FP must be
incorporated into new construction projects using the facility’s construction funding source. For
example, a NAF funded project to construct a new facility will include all security and AT/FP
requirements, including intrusion detection systems, as a NAF construction expense. These expenses
will be captured as a separate line item. APFs are authorized for AT/FP and security requirements for
repair projects. APFs may be used for intrusion detection equipment associated with a repair project;
however, non-standard equipment (e.g. AAFES proprietary systems), or systems in excessive of
installation requirements are a NAF funding responsibility. AT/FP measures should comply with
18                                                                          AFI32-1022       20 MAY 2009


guidance in UFC 04-010-01- DoD Antiterrorism/Force Protection Standards. AT/FP requirements
should comply with the DoD standards described in DoDI 2000.16, DoD Antiterrorism (AT) Standards
Many of the standards in DoDI 2000.16 are applicable to NAF Instrumentalities. For the purposes of
this AFI, the construction programmer should focus specifically on Standards 13, 15, 17, and 18.
3.9. Remote and Isolated Locations. The Office of the Secretary of Defense designates certain
installations as ―remote and isolated‖ locations. With this designation, Category C activities, including
AAFES, at approved locations are authorized Category B level of APF support for maintenance and
repair. This includes rearrangement and removal of non load-bearing walls to restore a building to
functional standards. Follow Tables 3.1 thru 3.4 and para 4.5.4.2 for construction funding guidelines.
Do not provide Category B level of APF support for construction. See Chapter 3 and Figure 3.1 of AFI
65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation and Nonappropriated Fund
Instrumentalities, for details and a list of these locations.
3.10. Exceeding 70 Percent of Facility Replacement Cost. If the repair cost (APF, NAF, or a
combination) exceeds 70 percent of the facility replacement cost, program construction of a new facility
using Tables 3.1-3.4. Facility replacement cost data may be obtained from the installation civil
engineer. Repair work exceeding 70 percent of the replacement cost may continue if supported by an
economic analysis and approved by the MAJCOM Civil Engineer. See AFI 32-1032 for further
guidance.
3.11. Use of Appropriated Funds or Nonappropriated Funds for Maintenance and Repair. Most
maintenance and repair applies to work needed to maintain buildings, grounds, and facility systems
(electrical, mechanical, plumbing, roofing, foundations, windows, doors, etc.). APFs are the appropriate
fund source for this type of maintenance and repair of all categories (A, B, and C), to include AAFES
facilities. Do not use APFs to repair functionally unique items required to support Category C activities.
(see Attachment 2 for a partial list of items). Note that funding for all nonstandard signage, e.g., those
using logos in nonstandard colors, are considered functionally unique.
     3.11.1. Waivers. If APFs are not available a waiver must be obtained to use NAFs for maintenance
     and repair of all categories. NAFs are the fund source for functionally unique items required to
     support Category C activity operations. Functionally unique items make the facility usable for the
     activity it contains, but are not considered part of the normal facility system (see Attachment 2 for a
     partial list of items). Also, some work in Category B activities can use NAFs or APFs depending on
     availability of funds without a waiver (See Table 3.2). Submit waiver requests to AF/A7CP for
     routing through USAF/A1SR to SAF/FMCEB.
3.12. Sustainable Design and Development (SDD) and Energy. All construction, renovation and
repair projects regardless of scope, fund source or programmed amount shall comply with the applicable
provisions of the Public Law 109-58 (Energy Policy Act of 2005), Executive Order 13423, and 42
U.S.C. 15801 (Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007). The AF has adopted the United States
Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green Building Rating
System as its self-assessment metric for construction and major renovation incorporating the Guiding
Principles for Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings set forth in the Federal
Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings Memorandum of Understanding (2006) as
required by EO 13423. Facilities that are maintained or repaired using APFs, or facilities using APFs as
the fund source to pay utilities, shall be constructed to the standards established in Air Force SDD and
energy policy.
AFI32-1022      20 MAY 2009                                                                           19


                                               Chapter 4

                           PROGRAMMING FACILITIES PROJECTS

4.1. Multipurpose Facilities. Commanders should consider constructing multipurpose facilities,
similar to modern municipal recreation centers and college student unions, designed for optimum use.
Most multi-use facilities include revenue-generating activities such as fast food outlets, delis, dining
rooms, concession areas, sports bars, and amusement machines, as well as mission-sustaining functions
(fitness centers, community centers, libraries, etc.). Therefore, commanders can use a pro-rated share of
APFs and NAFs for construction with prior Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Installations)
approval. A contract or agreement, as discussed in para 3.6, can also be established with approval from
Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Installations). Installations must submit requests to
MAJCOMs for transmittal to AF/A7CP, for processing.
4.2. Project Splitting. Installation and MAJCOM staffs must not plan a requirement for partial
completion with one project and the remainder of the requirement with a separate project or projects
programmed in successive years. This applies to both construction and repair (or combination
maintenance and repair) projects. Identify and program the total known or projected requirements as a
single project. This determines the appropriate project approval level. Identify all known construction
in a single project and all known repair (or combination maintenance and repair) in a single project.
This is true whether the projects are planned for simultaneous accomplishment or phased over a period
of years.
   4.2.1. Multiple Construction Projects. Treat all known construction work on a single facility,
   within a 24-month period, as a single project. The 24-month programming period begins upon
   contract award. The total combined cost determines the approval level; if the total cost exceeds
   $750,000, then Congressional approval is required, see Table 6.1. For Services projects, if the total
   cost exceeds $200,000, there must be Air Force NAF Facilities Panel approval, and the 1391 must
   contain the signatures of MAJCOM CIVIL ENGINEER and MAJCOM/A1S confirming that the
   proposed work complies with PVA or NAF Facilities Panel recommendations. For AAFES projects,
   if the total cost exceeds $200K, the MAJCOM CIVIL ENGINEER and AAFES Commander or
   Senior Vice President for Real Estate must sign the DD Form 1391.
   4.2.2. Multiple Repair Projects. Use the guidance in AFI 32-1032 paragraph 4.4 to determine the
   total repair requirements and subsequent approval level (See Table 6.2). For purposes of this
   approval, do not include day-to-day work, emergency work, or minor repairs. MAJCOM
   commanders and HQ AAFES can approve NAF repair projects up to $500,000. See AFI 32-1032,
   Planning And Programming Appropriated Funded Maintenance, Repair, And Construction Projects,
   paragraph 4.4 for details.
   4.2.3. Examples.
       4.2.3.1. Officers Clubs. In this example the solution will be a phased approach. An officers’
       club needs work in various portions of the facility (lounge, kitchen, ballroom, restrooms, etc.)
       but funds are not available to cover the total requirement. Since the installation identified all
       individual requirements, the installation must then consolidate them into one project document
       and seek the appropriate approval authority. The installation can then phase execution as
       feasible within the dollar constraints. Make sure each phase is complete and usable.
       4.2.3.2. Recreational Area Cabins. This example illustrates a combined approach. Recreation
       area cabins have deteriorated and require either repair or replacement. The installation must
20                                                                       AFI32-1022       20 MAY 2009


       combine the total number of cabins programmed for repair into a single repair project and the
       total number of cabins for replacement into a single construction project. Approve each project
       accordingly. The installation may phase the execution within funds availability. If there is a
       requirement for additional cabins, the installation must combine this requirement with the cabin
       replacement requirement in a single construction project.
       4.2.3.3. Golf Course Clubhouses. This example is governed by work class cost. A golf course
       clubhouse requires additions to the pro shop and locker room, plus repairs to the air conditioning
       system and replacement of the windows. The installation must combine the additions into a
       single construction project and the air conditioning system and the window replacements into a
       single repair project. The total of each class of work determines the individual project approval
       authority.
4.3. Short-term Facility Requirements. If a NAF construction or repair project generates the
requirement for short-term facilities (temporary or relocatable), use NAFs to pay all costs associated
with the facility programmed as a funded cost of the NAF construction or repair project. If an APF
construction or repair project on a NAF facility generates the requirement for short-term facilities, use
APFs to pay all costs associated with the facility programmed as a funded cost of the APF construction
or repair project. If a requirement is generated by both APF and NAF construction or repair work a
temporary facility can be shared by the APF and NAF activities. Costs may be split equitably using a
standard measure such as correlating costs with square footage used. Use AFI 32-1021, Planning and
Programming Military Construction (MILCON) Projects, for additional guidance on short-term
facilities.
4.4. Appropriated Fund Maintenance and Repair Support to Facilities Leased or Constructed
with Nonappropriated Funds. Do not use APFs for maintenance or repair of facilities leased or
constructed with NAFs until the Air Force acquires title to the facilities. The AF acquires title through
acceptance of the final DD Form 1354, Transfer and Acceptance of Military Real Property. If the NAF
activity, private organization, or a concession retains ownership (does not apply to AAFES) of the
facility, do not use APFs to maintain or repair the facility or equipment (see Table 3.6). However,
within available resources, the civil engineer staff may perform maintenance and repair on a
reimbursable basis provided beneficial occupancy is taken and the items are not part of a construction
project punchlist. See AFI 32-9005, Real Property Accountability and Reporting, for details on transfer
of ownership.
4.5. Services Facilities. Generally, the installation or MAJCOM funds projects with costs less than
$200,000, and the Air Force Chief of Staff approves central funds for projects with a cost of $200,000 or
more. The installation must submit all Services projects planned for construction from central funds
through the MAJCOM to the Air Force Services Agency for funding consideration. All Services
projects costing $200,000 and greater require an Air Staff or MAJCOM validated Project Validation
Assessment (PVA), depending on the source of funds (Air Force Central Funds, MAJCOM funds, or
base funds). The MAJCOM has project approval for all construction projects with a funded cost up to
$750,000 and repair projects with a funded cost up to $500,000. AF/A1S must provide funding
approval for any project funded with AF central NAFs. At the time of approval, for construction
projects with a funded cost between $200,000 and $750,000, the MAJCOM must submit a copy of the
approved/signed DD Form 1391 (front and signature pages only) to AF/A7CP and AF/A1SR. The
office of the OSD(P&R) will report the projects after the fact in the next annual Report to Congress.
The installation must submit to the MAJCOM complete DD Forms 1391 and 1391c, Fiscal Year 20XX
Military Construction Project Data, for each project with a funded cost over $750,000 in the annual
construction program. The MAJCOM submits this information to AF/A7CP for the Report to Congress.
AFI32-1022    20 MAY 2009                                                                              21


  4.5.1. Supervision, Inspection, and Overhead (SIOH). SIOH is a civil engineer responsibility
  and an APF cost if performed by installation CE employees (includes government and A-76
  contractor employees). SIOH is a NAF cost if performed by contract (A/E services), Army Corps of
  Engineers, AFCEE, AFCESA, overhires, or overtime by installation CE personnel. If performed by
  contract, the AFSVA indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) Title II Services contract should
  be utilized. An alternative source must provide services equal to those in the Services IDIQ SOW at
  significantly lower cost and be coordinated with AFSVA in advance.
  4.5.2. Design Services. Design is an APF cost if performed by in-house personnel (includes
  government and A-76 contractor employees). Design is a NAF cost if performed by contract,
  including the Army Corps of Engineers, or by overhires. Use NAFs to fund all contract design
  services except in the following cases when APFs can be used. Use published standard designs and
  design guides as applicable.
     4.5.2.1. An APF-authorized facility construction project has fallen out of a Fiscal Year 20XX
     Military Construction Program and the MAJCOM later reprograms it for construction with NAFs
     as a waiver to the DoD funding guidance.
     4.5.2.2. The MAJCOM programs a NAF-authorized facility construction project, according to
     DoD policy, in a Fiscal Year 20XX Military Construction Program as a waiver to the DoD
     funding policy.
  4.5.3. Design Instruction. The installation inputs projects in the Automated Civil Engineer System
  (ACES). For a typical annual program of construction projects with funded costs of over $750,000,
  AFSVA will request ACES Design Instructions from AF/A7CP to authorize designs to proceed,
  upon completion of the Project Validation Assessment for centrally funded projects. Design
  Instructions for advertisement and award will be managed by AFCEE with coordination by AFSVA
  and AF/A7CP. MAJCOM issues design instructions for construction or repair projects within base
  or MAJCOM approval authority.
  4.5.4. Golf Courses. NAFs are the normal source of funds for golf courses, maintenance facilities,
  golf clubhouses and parking, and golf cart storage, construction, maintenance, and repair. APFs may
  be used for maintenance and repair in certain cases: the clubhouse, cart storage facilities attached to
  a clubhouse, and parking lots. Additionally, base-wide services such as mosquito fogging, control of
  ticks, rats, forest pests, etc., may be provided as a common service. APFs may be used to restore
  grounds destroyed by acts of God (hurricane, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, etc). In the case of
  flooding, this refers to levels that exceed the 100-year flood as defined by the Federal Emergency
  Management Agency (FEMA) and where the location is not currently identified as a flood hazard
  area, refer to the Code of Federal Regulations, 44 C.F.R. 72, Procedures and Fees for Processing
  Map Changes. Do not use APFs to correct situations such as recurrent flooding (except where the
  course controls base water run-off during storms), or normal erosion of a river or creek exacerbated
  by an above normal amount of rain or snow. As a rule, do not use APFs for golf course grounds
  maintenance and repair. This includes maintenance facilities, latrines, shelters, pump houses,
  sprinkler systems, and driving ranges, etc. Specialized pest control services such as herbicide and
  pesticide treatment of fairways, greens, water hazards, sand traps, etc. may be provided on a
  reimbursable basis.
     4.5.4.1. Golf Course Programming Guidance. For the purpose of construction and major
     repair project approval, divide a golf course into the following separate entities:
         4.5.4.1.1. Golf Course Playing Area (to include the course itself and tee boxes, fairways,
         traps, bunkers, greens, golf cart paths, driving range, practice putting green, trees and shrubs,
22                                                                         AFI32-1022      20 MAY 2009


           water hazards, shelters, latrines, and snack bars on the course, and irrigation system –
           including sprinklers, piping, ponds, water wells, and other irrigation appurtenances).
           4.5.4.1.2. Golf Clubhouse (to include parking lot and golf cart storage if the cart storage is
           attached to the clubhouse).
           4.5.4.1.3. Maintenance Facilities (program each building with a separate facility number as a
           separate project). This includes golf cart storage facilities that are not attached to the
           clubhouse.
       4.5.4.2. Remote and Isolated Locations. The Office of the Secretary of Defense, OSD(P&R),
       officially designates certain installations as "remote and isolated" locations. With this
       designation, the installation may increase the use of APFs to maintain golf course facilities. The
       following breaks out the appropriate fund source for various golf course requirements at remote
       and isolated locations.
           4.5.4.2.1. Appropriated Fund Support. APFs are authorized for routine golf course
           grounds maintenance and repair at remote and isolated locations. Routine grounds
           maintenance and repair includes mowing of grass, maintaining greens/tees/fairways,
           irrigating, applying fertilizer and soil amendments, verticutting greens, aerating, top dressing
           of greens, green collars and tees, over seeding, repairing damaged areas, weeding, removing
           debris, providing routine maintenance of maintenance facilities, cart storage facilities,
           latrines and shelters, cart paths and bridges, course maintenance facilities, changing holes,
           marking the course, maintaining trees and shrubs, maintaining sand traps and bunkers,
           maintaining water hazards, maintaining irrigation distribution systems, controlling erosion,
           applying pest control products as needed, controlling pest, and restoring grounds destroyed
           by vandalism and fire or acts of God.
       4.5.4.2.2. Nonappropriated Fund Support. For exceptionally large repair projects, such as
       when SAF/IEI approval is required, NAFs are the appropriate fund source for additions,
       alterations, and replacements to the golf course playing area and golf maintenance facilities
       either by contract or reimbursement to APFs at remote and isolated locations. Also use NAFs to
       construct golf clubhouses and cart storage facilities.
       4.5.4.3. Unrelated Costs. APFs are the appropriate fund source for maintenance costs for
       facilities or environmental features adjacent to or within the boundaries of the golf course that
       would exist if the golf course was not there. Do not report these costs in golf course
       maintenance. This includes, but is not limited to, perimeter roads, drainage ditches, culverts,
       fences, structures, cemeteries, tree removal, waterways, or appurtenances (power lines, runway
       approach lights, etc.).
4.6. Temporary Lodging Facilities. Use ―lodging funds‖ from the NAF account centrally managed by
the Air Force Services Agency (AFSVA) or Installation NAFs for all construction and minor
construction projects with related furnishings. AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale,
Welfare, and Recreation and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, provides the funding source
guidance for all associated expenditures. AFSVA identifies and prioritizes projects for Air Force central
funding. AFSVA notifies bases that they have a funded project and must submit the project in
accordance with NAF facilities policies. Bases submit complete DD Forms 1391 and 1391c, Fiscal Year
20XX Military Construction Project Data. The MAJCOM provides project approval for NAF
construction projects up to $750,000 and NAF repair projects up to $500,000. At the time of approval,
for construction projects costing between $200,000 and $750,000, the MAJCOM must submit a copy of
the approved/signed DD Form 1391 (front and signature pages only) to AF/A7CP and AF/A1SR. The
AFI32-1022      20 MAY 2009                                                                             23


office of OSD(P&R) reports the projects after the fact to Congress in the next annual NAF Report to
Congress. For projects exceeding the MAJCOM’s approval authority, seek approval according to Table
6.1 and Table 6.2. The installation submits projects with a funded cost of $750,000 and more through
the MAJCOM to AF/A7CP, before advertisement and award.
4.7. Army and Air Force Exchange Service Facilities (AAFES). Unless exempted in this instruction,
AAFES funds all construction and minor construction projects with related supervision, inspection, and
overhead, equipment purchase, and installation. This includes DoD-approved remote and isolated
locations. AAFES Board of Directors provides all authority for AAFES projects. The AAFES
commander funds projects within amounts delegated by the Board of Directors. The AAFES
commander in turn delegates approval authority to overseas region commanders and CONUS region
directors. Projects that exceed the AAFES Commander's approval authority are presented at an AAFES
Board meeting for funding approval. The AAFES Commander has project approval for all projects with
a funded construction cost of up to and including $750,000. For construction projects with a funded cost
from $200,000 to $750,000, the AAFES command engineer must submit a copy of the approved/signed
DD Form 1391 (front and signature pages only) to AF/A7CP. The office of OSD(P&R) will report
these projects after the fact in the next annual NAF Construction Report to the Congress. The AAFES
command engineer must submit to AF/A7CP the documentation specified in Attachment 3 for all
projects costing over $750,000 for inclusion in the next annual NAF report to Congress. The installation
commander or designee must notify and coordinate with HQ AAFES on all proposed construction that
will directly impact AAFES operated facilities.
   4.7.1. Design Services. AAFES funds all design services except the following where AAFES may
   use APFs:
       4.7.1.1. An APF-authorized facility construction project has fallen out of a Fiscal Year XX
       Military Construction Program and the MAJCOM later reprograms it for construction with
       NAFs as a waiver to the DoD funding policy.
       4.7.1.2. A NAF-authorized facility construction project, according to DoD policy, is
       programmed in a Fiscal Year XX Military Construction Program as a waiver to the DoD funding
       policy.
   4.7.2. Design Instruction. Installations will submit the projects in the Automated Civil Engineer
   System (ACES) and will also enter the DD Forms 1391 into the system. Installations and AFCEE
   are required to maintain the ACES records and shall not advertise or award construction projects or
   begin design efforts until AF/A7CP issues the appropriate design instructions in ACES. Design
   instructions issued in ACES will be coordinated with AAFES.
   4.7.3. Sustainable Design and Development (SDD) and Energy. All construction, renovation and
   repair projects regardless of scope, fund source or programmed amount shall comply with the
   applicable provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Executive Order 13423, and the Energy
   Independence and Security Act of 2007. The AF has adopted the United States Green Building
   Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green Building Rating System as its
   self-assessment metric for construction and major renovation incorporating the Guiding Principles
   for Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings set forth in the Federal
   Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings Memorandum of Understanding (2006)
   as required by EO 13423. Facilities that are maintained or repaired using APFs, or facilities using
   APFs as the fund source to pay utilities, shall be constructed to the standards established in Air Force
   SDD and energy policy.
24                                                                          AFI32-1022       20 MAY 2009


     4.7.4. Maintenance and Repair Projects. Maintenance and repair work is needed to maintain
     buildings, grounds, and facility systems such as electrical, mechanical, plumbing, roofing,
     foundations, windows, doors, etc. APFs are the appropriate fund source for maintenance and repair
     whether in CONUS or overseas. See Table 3.3 and paragraph 3.11 for additional guidance. AAFES
     will fund the following repair and maintenance exceptions:
        4.7.4.1. Owned by AAFES. Structures to which the AAFES holds title.
        4.7.4.2. Occupied by AAFES. Interior finishes of space occupied by the AAFES (e.g., paint,
        floors, ceilings, special lighting) and of building modifications and alterations solely for purposes
        unique to AAFES operations.
        4.7.4.3. On Loan to AAFES. Available Government equipment on loan to the AAFES.
     4.7.5. Procedures for Submitting AAFES Projects. AAFES develops exchange requirements.
     AAFES develops project requirements and initiates projects in coordination with the Installation
     Commander and Civil Engineer Squadron. For projects requiring DD Forms 1391, the Civil
     Engineer Squadron Commander, Installation Commander and MAJCOM A7C (as applicable) will
     sign the 1391 indicating their proprietary approval of the project. AAFES obtains funding approval
     through the AAFES Commander and Board of Directors as appropriate. AAFES projects will
     comply with base and MAJCOM design and architectural standards and siting in accordance with
     the base general plan.
        4.7.5.1. Projects Within local Installation Commander Approval Authority. The AAFES
        will submit an Air Force Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request, to the Civil Engineer
        Squadron Commander when projects are within the limits delegated by USAF. The Civil
        Engineer Squadron Commander processes the Air Force Form 332 as required for approval or
        disapproval. If approved, the AAFES may proceed with the work using in-house or contract
        personnel without processing a DD Form 1391.
        4.7.5.2. Projects Over Installation Approval Authority. HQ AAFES provides draft DD
        Forms 1391 and 1391c to the installation for completion and the addition of base unique
        requirements, and signature. The installation forwards the documents for MAJCOM Civil
        Engineer signature. The MAJCOM forwards the completed package back to HQ AAFES.
4.8. Private Organization Programming. For purposes of documenting DD Forms 1391, include
projects proposed for financing with private funds in the NAF category; for example: banks, credit
unions, and so forth, which are not NAF instrumentalities (AFI 34-223, Private Organizations (PO)
Program). Do not include private capital projects for contractors performing Research, Development,
Test, and Evaluation or industrial contracts in the NAF category (AFI 63-609, Managing Industrial
Facilities). Do not use APFs or Services NAFs for constructing, relocating, repairing, or maintaining
facilities for private organizations unless specifically authorized in policy or law. Use AFI 32-9003
Granting Temporary Use of Air Force Real Property and AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of
Morale, Welfare, and Recreation and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities as primary references for
guidance on Government support to private organizations. Facilities constructed with private funds
generally require three approvals prior to contract award. Contact AF/A7CI to determine if a beddown
approval is required. If the facility is to be donated to the Air Force, the Air Force Real Property
Agency (AFRPA) is responsible for processing the formal gift acceptance package. Details on the gift
acceptance process can be found in AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force. Construction
projects over $750,000 require OSD(P&R) approval and Congressional notification. MAJCOMs submit
project documents to AF/A7CP to process through SAF/IEI to OSD(P&R) for project approval.
AFI32-1022      20 MAY 2009                                                                            25


   4.8.1. Project Approval for Private Capital Funded Projects. The installation submits through
   the MAJCOM to AF/A7CP, private capital funded projects with funded costs $750,000 and greater.
   AF/A7CP obtains approval and reports to the Congress. Private organization projects must comply
   with the same construction project approval levels and congressional reporting requirements as all
   other NAF projects. Forward DD Forms 1391 and 1391c with a request for out lease to AF/A7CP,
   and the Air Force Real Property Agency (AFRPA) concurrently. Submit these projects and requests
   for out lease when both are fully developed, to permit progress on the out lease. For projects with a
   funded cost between $200,000 and $750,000, the MAJCOM must submit a copy of the
   approved/signed DD Form 1391 (front and signature pages only) to AF/A7CP – at the time of
   approval. Private entrepreneurs may initiate design at their own risk. NAF Public Private Venture
   (PPV) projects fall under this paragraph. Governing instructions are AFI 32-1024, Standard Facility
   Requirements, AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property, and AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary
   use of Air Force Real Property. For specific information on establishing the following, see the
   referenced instruction.
   4.8.2. Banks and Credit Unions. Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Installations) and
   Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management) jointly approve the establishment of bank and
   credit union operations, regardless of cost. The installation must submit both the project and request
   for out lease simultaneously through the MAJCOM to Secretary of the Air Force (Financial
   Management) and AFRPA. The construction project approval levels and congressional reporting
   requirements that apply to all other NAF projects also apply to banks and credit unions (See Table
   6.1.). Maintenance and Repair of Banks and Credit Unions are funded in accordance with the lease
   agreement for the facility. For projects with a funded cost between $200,000 and $750,000, the
   MAJCOM must submit a copy of the approved/signed DD Form 1391 (front and signature pages
   only) to AF/A7CP – at the time of approval. For additional guidance see DoD 7000.14 R, Vol. 5,
   Chap. 34, Financial Management Regulation (FMR), Procedures Governing Banks, Credit Unions,
   and Other Financial Institutions on DoD Installations.
       4.8.2.1. The MAJCOM commander, or designee, may approve projects with funded costs less
       than $750,000 provided:
           4.8.2.1.1. The bank or credit union already is authorized to operate an office on the
           installation.
           4.8.2.1.2. The proposed lease or lease extension plus any previous lease held by the
           institution does not exceed 25 years.
           4.8.2.1.3. The building space is confined to the needs of the bank or credit union, and does
           not provide space for other commercial or government activities.
           4.8.2.1.4. The building does not exceed authorized space criteria in Air Force Instruction 32-
           1024.
4.9. Offer of Gifts for Buildings. When a gift of real property involves construction on Air Force land
or any modification, alteration or addition to Air Force structures, which will result in additions to the
Air Force real property inventory, the real property office will process the proposed gift to AFRPA in
accordance with AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force, Para. 1.13 and 3.15, and AFI
32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property. All other construction project approval levels and reporting
requirements that apply to other NAF projects also apply to offer of gifts. For any offer of gift that
involves real property construction work, obtain proper project approval (Table 6.1). If the funded
project cost is over $750,000, the installation must concurrently submit through the MAJCOM to
AFRPA and AF/A7CP, the DD Forms 1391 and 1391c and offer of gift package for acceptance of the
26                                                                         AFI32-1022      20 MAY 2009


gift, appropriate approval, and subsequent reporting to the Congress. This includes facilities such as
Fisher Houses, museums, etc. Make sure the total amount of funds required for the construction project
is available before submission of the package. See the AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property, AFI
35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures, and AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air
Force, for specific guidance.
     4.9.1. Museum Construction. For funding guidance of museum facilities see AFI 65-601 Vol.1,
     Budget Guidance and Procedures, Sec. 4J and see Chapter 6 of this document for the approval
     process.
4.10. Red Cross Projects. See AFI 36-3105, Red Cross Activities Within the Air Force, and AFI 65-
601, Vol.1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, for policies and procedures for Red Cross facilities in
support of the Air Force.
4.11. Commissary Surcharge. According to 10 U.S.C 2685, funds originating from the adjustment of
sale prices of goods and services sold in commissary store facilities are considered Commissary
Surcharge Funds. These funds shall be used only to acquire (including acquisition by lease), construct,
convert, expand, improve, repair, maintain, and equip the physical infrastructure of commissary stores
and central product processing facilities of the Defense Commissary system; and to cover environmental
evaluation and construction costs, including surveys, administration, overhead, planning, and design,
related to activities described in this paragraph. The term physical infrastructure includes real property,
utilities, and equipment (installed and free standing, including computer equipment), necessary to
provide a complete and usable commissary store or central product processing facility. See DoDI
7700.20, Commissary Surcharge, Nonappropriated Fund (NAF), and Privately Financed Construction
Policy.
4.12. Housing Privatization. By law, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), the
Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), and the installation Services have the exclusive right to provide
resale merchandise, services, and recreational operations or activities on DoD installations and Air Force
housing privatization projects. Facilities owned or operated by these entities can be included in
privatization initiatives with the approval of the appropriate authority. Reference AFI 32-6007,
Privatized Family Housing, for additional information.
AFI32-1022      20 MAY 2009                                                                              27

                  TYPES OF LABOR FOR USE ON COMMUNITY FACILITIES

5.1. Military and Appropriated Fund Civilian Labor. Table 5.1 contains labor guidance for
construction, repair, and maintenance of community facilities (Categories A, B, C, and Lodging Fund
Facilities). The "X" on the chart indicates that the facility category is authorized use of that particular
labor. MAJCOMs should contact AF/A7CP and AFCEE, for clarification.
5.2. Civil Engineer Military and Appropriated Fund Civilian Labor. Use this labor on mission-
related and Category A facilities and for maintaining and repairing all facilities, including NAF facilities
(except for golf course grounds maintenance). If the workforce is available, use it for authorized NAF
facilities. When using civil engineer labor on authorized Category B and C NAF facilities, the NAF
instrumentality custodian must reimburse the civil engineer at labor rates (shop rates) with NAFs except
as noted in para 5.4. See Table 5.1. Do not use civil engineer labor on NAF facilities to the extent that
the workload requires work on other facilities be contracted out.
5.3. Civil Engineer Military Training Labor. Do not use military training exercises performed by
Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineer (RED HORSE), Base
Engineer Emergency Forces (BEEF), AFRC, ANG, and other military personnel, to construct, maintain,
or repair projects on facilities for which NAFs are the funding source for minor or major construction.
Military training labor may not be used to construct privately funded projects including banks and
museums. This guidance also applies to remote and isolated locations. Military members participating
in extended training periods may donate labor at services facilities while off duty during the training
period. See Table 5.1.
5.4. Donated Labor. Military or APF civilian personnel can volunteer or donate their labor at Services
facilities after their normal duty hours. Members of any military service can donate their labor. Only
individuals in an official leave status can donate their time during the normal duty day. To avoid
violation of 31 U.S.C. § 1341 (Anti-Deficiency Act), individuals offering to provide voluntary services
must first agree in writing that the services are truly voluntary and that they expect no compensation nor
will they make any claim for compensation.
5.5. Self-Help Labor. Military or APF civilian personnel can donate their labor at APF Services
facilities at the installation where employed. They cannot receive additional pay or compensatory time.
They can perform this self-help during their normal duty hours. To avoid violation of the Anti-
Deficiency Act, individuals offering to provide voluntary services must first agree in writing that the
services are truly voluntary and they expect no compensation nor will they claim for compensation. See
AFMAN 34-214, Procedures for Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting, for
instructions on the use of NAF self-help labor.
5.6. Prison Labor. Federal/state prisoners or incarcerated military personnel perform this labor. Use
prison labor primarily for the upkeep of common grounds and for limited construction, maintenance, and
repair work, as stated in Table 5.1. Military prisoners do not receive additional pay. Only federal/state
prisoners can work on golf courses and then only if no other installation grounds upkeep activities can
use their labor. Use NAFs for any expenses incurred when the installation pays federal/state prisoners
for work on golf courses. Do not use prison labor for any type of work at or around child development
or youth facilities.

NOTES:

1. This table is applicable to those facilities that have NAF or private funds as the fund source for construction. MAJCOM
Commander may delegate to the installations only approval authority within criteria for projects below $200K.

2. MAJCOM Commander may re-delegate approval authority within criteria for projects $200K-$750K to the MAJCOM
Civil Engineer or Deputy Engineer, but not below. Also the MAJCOM only has "proprietary" approval of AAFES projects.

3. At the time of approval, MAJCOM must submit a copy of the approved/signed DD Form 1391 (front and signature pages
only) for projects $200-750K to AF/A7CP and AF/A1SF. SAF/IEI will continue to report these after-the-fact in the annual
NAF Construction Report to Congress.

4. These projects require after-the-fact congressional notification.

5. Installations may request consideration for authority to advertise once OSD(P&R) submits to Congress. AF/A7CP
validates the current working estimate, and AFSVA certifies funds are available for Services projects.

6. These require congressional notification and release in the Annual NAF Construction Report to Congress before award.

7. OSD(P&R) approves most waivers to fund source. Waivers and exceptions of projects exceeding $750K must still be
reported to Congress. If a criteria does not exist or does not specifically address the facility an ―exception‖ is required.
―Waivers‖ are obtained for existing and applicable criteria that the programmer is requesting an exemption from.

8. Example: SAF/IEI can approve the mix for an APF Military Clothing Sales Store within an AAFES (NAF) Base
Exchange facility or excessive APF utilities and roads from the base system to the site boundary or nearest manhole,
whichever is closest to the facility under construction.

9. These projects use private funds, not APFs or Services NAFs.


6.2. Maintenance and Repair Project Approval Levels. Table 6.2 details the approval level for
maintenance and repair projects on facilities where NAFs are specified fund source for construction.
AFI32-1022        20 MAY 2009                                                                                       31


This table applies to project approval (not to be confused with funding approval) for those facilities that
have NAF as the fund source for construction.

NOTES:

1. MAJCOM/CC can delegate his or her approval authority to the installation commander or his or her designee.

2. For repair of Category C items required to support activity operations: MAJCOM commander can delegate approval level
to the installation commander, but it cannot be re-delegated below the SV or CE commanders.

3. MAJCOM commander, or his or her designee, can combine a $500K NAF repair project with a $1,000K APF repair
project for a total effort of $1,500K in a single facility.

4. AAFES has up to $500K repair authority using NAFs.

5. At the time of approval, MAJCOM must provide AF/A7CP a copy of the DD Form 1391 (front page only) for any
approved APF repair project costing between $500K and $1M.

6. The $5,000K AF/A7C approval level includes NAF, APF or any combination of both.


    6.2.1. Approval Authority for Repair Cost Increases. Approval authority for cost increases to
    repair projects lies with different organizations based upon the type of funding and the amount of the
    increase. Reference AFI 34-205, Services Nonappropriated Fund Facilities Projects for specific
    guidance on approval levels. The total repair cost shouldn’t exceed 70% of the replacement cost
    (see paragraph 3.10 for more information). MAJCOMs must provide a courtesy copy of the
    approval document to AF/A7CP.
6.3. Advertisement and Award. NAF projects over $750K require AF/A7CP approval prior to both
advertisement and award.
    6.3.1. Advertisement Authority. AF/A7CP authorization is required before installations may
    advertise a construction project.
         6.3.1.1. Advanced Advertisement. AF/A7CP will consider advanced advertising authority
         once OSD(P&R) forwards the annual Nonappropriated Fund Construction Report to the
         Congress -- provided the cost remains valid and AFSVA certifies funds are available. AF/A7CP
         will consider advanced advertising authority for projects within AF/A7C and Deputy Assistant
         Secretary of the Air Force (Installations) authority on a case-by-case basis.
    6.3.2. Statement of Work. For Services centrally funded construction and A-E design projects
    costing $200,000 and greater, MAJCOMs must ensure installations submit copies of the statement of
    work to AFSVA/SVXF.           Installations must obtain AFSVA/SVXF coordination prior to
    advertisement of any (design and/or construction) centrally funded NAF project. In addition
    AF/A7CP design instruction is required prior to advertisement.
32                                                                     AFI32-1022      20 MAY 2009


     6.3.3. Contract Award. Do not award a construction contract until both project (A7C) and funding
     (A1S) approvals are received. For AF Services projects, ensure you have certification of funding
     from AFSVA prior to advertisement or award.
AFI32-1022      20 MAY 2009                                                                           33

                       CONGRESSIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

7.1. Requirements and Conditions on Projects Reported to the Congress. The annual NAF report
includes major construction projects planned for award within the next fiscal year. OSD(P&R) forwards
the report to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees. Make sure the projects are at least 35
percent (design-build can be 15 percent) designed before submitting them to AF/A7CP, for inclusion in
the report. Funds must be available for construction to meet the award schedules. Submit proposed
design, advertising, and award schedules for each project reported.
7.2. Submittal Process. Installation and MAJCOM staffs must obtain OSD(P&R) approval for
projects costing over $750,000. The installation initiates the projects and submits its annual program to
the MAJCOM, which forwards the MAJCOM program to AF/A7CP, for submittal to Deputy Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force (Installations), the OSD(P&R), and the Congress. AAFES projects are
submitted directly to AF/A7CP. Follow guidance from AF/A7CP for the annual report.
7.3. Report Contents. The NAF Report to Congress content is prescribed by DoDI 7700.18
Commissary Surcharge, Nonappropriated Fund (NAF), and Privately Financed Construction Reporting
Requirements. The Report shall contain an executive summary of the NAF construction program,
proposed major construction projects for the next fiscal year, minor construction projects approved since
the previous report, status of previously approved major construction projects, a summary of NAF
projects submitted in the President’s Budget request for MILCON appropriations, a summary of fixed
and annual capital investments, and a summary of proposed PPV projects.
   7.3.1. Executive Summary. The executive summary provides a narrative overview of construction
   program management and oversight. The narrative compares the program being reported to the
   previously reported construction program. The summary shall include a statement of assurance that
   funds are available and programmed for the projects. AAFES/RE submits the narrative summary for
   the exchange program and AFSVA/SVXF submits the narrative summary for the MWR and lodging
   programs. Both summaries are submitted to AF/A7CP for consolidation. AF/A7CP will incorporate
   privately funded projects into the overall program summary. Enclosure 4 of DoDI 7700.18 provides
   additional information on summary requirements.
   7.3.2. Major Construction Projects.
       7.3.2.1. Project Narrative. A one paragraph narrative description for each major construction
       project shall be provided in the form prescribed by DoDI 7700.18, enclosure 5, attachment 1 and
       shall include the information required in DoDI 7700.18, paragraph E5.1. Fisher House
       construction project are not required to be submitted as part of this report to Congress.
       7.3.2.2. Project Documentation. The following documentation shall be submitted by the
       MAJCOMs to AF/A7CP for each major construction project: DD Form 1390, FY ____ Military
       Construction Program, DD Form 1391; and DD Form 1391c, which addresses design/award
       schedule; financial analysis information as prescribed in DoDI 7700.18 paragraph E5.2.1.3; and
       a project certification form signed by the commander.
       7.3.2.3. Program Summary Data. Major construction projects shall be summarized by
       program, showing state/country, installation, project title, total investment cost, construction
       cost, design cost, collateral equipment cost, design stage, net present value, internal rate of
       return, payback period, scope, estimated contract award date, and funding source. AAFES/RE
34                                                                          AFI32-1022      20 MAY 2009


        and AFSVA/SVXF are responsible for submitting summaries for their respective programs to
        AF/A7CP for consolidation.
     7.3.3. Minor Construction Projects. MAJCOMs shall submit a list of NAF construction projects
     with costs between $200,000 and $750,000, that have been approved since the last Report to
     Congress. Specify the state/country, installation, project title, total investment cost, construction
     cost, design cost, collateral equipment cost, scope, estimated contract award date, and the funding
     source (NAF, surcharge, or private funds) using the format in Enclosure 6 of DoDI 7700.18.
     7.3.4. Status of Previously Approved Projects. AFSVA/SVXF and AAFES/RE shall submit a
     status report of all previously approved major projects to AF/A7CP. Specify the fiscal year
     approved, state/country, installation, project title, programmed amount and total investment cost.
     For projects still under design, report the percent complete and estimated award date. For projects in
     construction, report the percent complete and estimated construction complete date. Projects that
     have been cancelled; projects not awarded within 1 fiscal year following the approved program year;
     and projects that have experienced cost/scope changes are addressed in the following paragraphs.
        7.3.4.1. Cancelled Projects. Congressional notification is required for projects cancelled that
        had funded costs over $750,000. When it is necessary to cancel a project of Services, AAFES, or
        private organizations, the appropriate agency must immediately inform AF/A7C. List the
        previously approved project, specify the fiscal year approved, state or country, installation,
        project title, and total investment cost. Also provide a summary paragraph describing the
        rationale for canceling the project. Notify AFSVA on all centrally funded project cancellations.
        AF/A7CP will then cancel the Design Instruction in the Automated Civil Engineer System
        (ACES-PM).
        7.3.4.2. Delayed Contract Awards. The Congress emphasizes timely program execution;
        awards for projects of $750,000 and over are achieved through aggressive and prudent project
        management. Authority to award expires no later than the end of the fiscal year in which the
        project was reported to the Congress. AF/A7CP must approve extensions for projects not
        awarded by that date. AF/A7CP will consider any extension for up to 1 year after the reported
        year to accommodate unforeseen site problems, Architect-Engineer design delays, compliance
        with host-nation agreements, year-end procurement difficulties, etc. When this type of situation
        becomes apparent, the Civil Engineer Squadron Commander forwards an extension request to
        the MAJCOM/A7 Programs Division providing an explanation of the delay and a revised award
        schedule. The MAJCOM forwards the request to AF/A7CP. The request for extension must be
        routed through the MAJCOM/A7 Programs Division Chief. For projects in which AFCEE is the
        design and construction manager, the notification will be processed through AFCEE/CM with a
        courtesy copy to the MAJCOM/A7 Programs Division Chief. Include the fiscal year approved,
        state or country, installation, project title, Service, total investment cost and estimated contract
        award date and a paragraph describing the rationale for the delay (see Attachment 6). A revised
        DD Form 1391 shall be provided for each project. Projects not awarded by 1 Apr of the
        extension year will be submitted through the MAJCOM/A7P Programs Division Chief to
        AF/A7CP for inclusion in the annual NAF report to the Congress. Continue efforts to award the
        project. If award is accomplished by 1 Aug notify AF/A7CP and the project will be removed
        from the ―Not Awarded Within Two Years‖ Section of the Report to Congress. For AAFES
        projects, re-reporting will be accomplished thru AAFES to AF/A7CP as part of the annual report
        to Congress.
AFI32-1022   20 MAY 2009                                                                          35


     7.3.4.3. Services Cost or Scope Changes. For projects with a programmed amount over
     $750,000 Air Staff can approve a 25 percent increase in project costs without driving a
     requirement to re-report the project to Congress. For projects over $750,000 Air Staff can
     approve a 10 percent increase or decrease in project scope without driving a requirement to re-
     report the project to Congress. Scope or cost changes that exceed these Air Staff approval
     thresholds must be re-reported to Congress and approved by OSD(P&R) prior to contract award.
     If a project previously estimated to cost $750,000 or below (funded cost) exceeds the $750,000
     ceiling, then it must be approved by OSD(P&R) and reported to Congress as part of the annual
     report to Congress before it can be placed under contract. If contractor claims create a
     requirement to seek higher headquarters approval for a cost increase, request guidance from
     AF/A7CP.
        7.3.4.3.1. MAJCOM/A1S and AFSVA Role. Since the MAJCOM/A1S and AFSVA play a
        vital role in the scope and cost variations process, the MAJCOM Civil Engineer and AFCEE
        staffs must work closely with those organizations.
        7.3.4.3.2. MAJCOM Approval Authority. MAJCOMs must comply with the guidance
        prescribed in AFI 34-205 regarding approval authority for all scope variations and cost
        changes. MAJCOM will validate project documentation submitted to AF/A7CP. The
        MAJCOM/A7 Programs Division Chief or AFCEE/CM (not the MAJCOM project manager)
        must certify for completeness and accuracy project documents for NAF projects. See AFI 34-
        205, Services Nonappropriated Fund Facility Projects, for additional instructions.
        7.3.4.3.3. AF NAF Facilities Panel Approval Authority. For project changes not within
        MAJCOM authority, the MAJCOM or AFCEE will forward an approval request through
        AFSVA/SVXF to the Air Force NAF Facilities Panel. Submit justification for adjustment as
        specified by AFI 34-205.
        7.3.4.3.4. Cost Increases. If the cost increase exceeds 25 percent of the approved cost, the
        installation will submit through the MAJCOM/A1S the appropriate documentation to
        AFSVA in accordance with the procedures described in AFI 34-205. If the Air Force NAF
        Facilities Panel and AF/A1S concur, the installation and AFCEE will submit revised DD
        Forms 1391/1391c to AF/A7CP to initiate the congressional re-notification process. A
        courtesy copy will be provided and the submission coordinated with the respective
        MAJCOM. See Attachment 6 for a listing of information required for the congressional re-
        notification process. Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) funding approval is required for
        all projects funded with AF Central NAFs regardless of cost. AF/A1S is responsible for
        staffing the approval request to CSAF. This includes projects with cost increases funded by
        AF Central NAFs. Projects over $750,000, cost increases over 25 percent and scope
        increases over 10 percent also require OSD(P&R) project approval and congressional re-
        notification.
        7.3.4.3.5. Scope Variation Exceeds 10 Percent. If the scope variation (increase or
        decrease) exceeds 10 percent of the approved scope, the installation will submit through the
        MAJCOM/A1S the appropriate documentation to AFSVA in accordance with the procedures
        described in AFI 34-205. If the Air Force NAF Facilities Panel and AF/A1S concur, the
        installation and AFCEE will submit revised DD Forms 1391/1391c to AF/A7CP to initiate
        OSD(P&R) approval/congressional re-notification process. A courtesy copy will be
        provided and the submission coordinated with the respective MAJCOM. A scope increase
        must not result in a project that exceeds space criteria in AFH 32-1084, a AF/A7C approved

           specific waiver guidance. Submit requests to AF/A7CP.
        7.3.4.4. Exchange Projects - Scope and Cost Changes. Scope increases or decreases beyond
        specific thresholds require congressional re-notification. For projects approved by Congress
        (over $750,000), HQ, AAFES may approve scope increases and decreases to 10 percent of the
        approved scope. They may also approve cost increases up to 25 percent over the approved
        funded amount, provided they do not exceed any other approval thresholds. Scope variations
        (increase or decrease) beyond 10 percent and cost increases beyond 25 percent require
        congressional re-notification. Submit requests with revised DD Forms 1391/1391c to AF/A7CP
        for processing.
        7.3.4.5. Projects $200,000 - $750,000. If a project previously estimated to cost $750,000 or
        below (funded cost) exceeds the $750,000 ceiling, then it must be approved by OSD(P&R) and
        reported to Congress as part of the annual report to Congress before it can be placed under
        contract.
        7.3.4.6. All Other Nonappropriated Fund Projects - Scope and Cost Variations. Apply the
        same guidance as for Exchange projects. However, the NAF instrumentality providing or
        authorizing project funds must approve funding for all increases.

                      SUPPORT ACTIVITY OPERATIONS

Nonappropriated funds will pay for the maintenance and repair of functionally unique items required to
support Category C program operations. Functionally unique items make the facility usable for the
activity it contains, but are not considered part of the normal facility system. For guidance on
Appropriated Funds, see Chapter 3. Paragraphs A2.1, A2.2, and A2.3 contain a representative listing
of functionally unique items for your use. Bases should establish a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
with NAF activities to define the expected level of service the base would provide with APFs. Contact
AF/A7CP if a particular work requirement requires clarification.

      DOCUMENTS REQUIRED FOR PROJECT APPROVAL AND FUNDING SUPPORT

A3.1. Required Documentation. The amount and complexity of the required documentation are
dependent on the required approval level for the project.
     A3.1.1. Within Installation Commander's Approval Authority. Nonappropriated funded
     projects within the installation commander's approval authority typically requires an AF Form 332 or
     DD Form 1391, Project Validation Assessment for Services projects (as determined by AFSVA), an
     Installation Commander's Certificate (format provided at end of this attachment), and 70 percent
     calculation if applicable.
     A3.1.2. Within MAJCOM Approval Authority. These projects require a DD Form 1391, single
     line drawings, site plan, detail cost estimate, existing facility/deficiency detail data sheets using DD
     Form 1391c, Project Validation Assessment for Services projects (as determined by AFSVA),
     Installation Commander's Certificate (format provided at end of this attachment), 70 percent
     calculation if applicable, and other appropriate certificates required by the major command. In
     addition to the major command civil engineer signing the DD Form 1391, the major command
     Director of Services must sign confirming the proposed work complies with the approved Project
     Validation Assessment. For AAFES projects, the Base Civil Engineer, MAJCOM Civil Engineer,
     and AAFES Command Engineer must sign the DD Form 1391.
     A3.1.3. Projects with Funded Costs of $750,000 and More, or that Require Waiver, Exception,
     or Mixing of Funds. For these nonappropriated-funded projects, submit the following
     documentation (much of this data can be obtained from the PVA):
        A3.1.3.1. DD Form 1391. Use the Automated Civil Engineer Systems (ACES) 1391 Processor.
        See Attachment 4 for reference.
        A3.1.3.2. Existing Facility/Deficiency Detail Data Sheet. Use DD Form 1391c.
        A3.1.3.3. Disposition of Existing Facilities Sheet. Use DD Form 1391c. If the activity vacates
        the building, state the use and the function that will ultimately occupy the facility. State the
        amount of space (in square meters) now used by the function. Justify why the function requires
        the space. If the function relocates state what happens to the space it presently occupies? If
        relocation results in a "domino" effect, explain associated actions, costs, and fund sources. If the
        installation commits a building for disposal, show disposal program and schedule.
        A3.1.3.4. Supporting Financial Data for Category C Revenue Generating Activities. (as
        prescribed annually by AFSVA). This requirement does not apply to AAFES projects.
        A3.1.3.5. Joint Use With Nearby Installations. Use DD Form 1391c, if applicable. Describe
        the availability and proximity of similar facilities including those of other Services. If like
        facilities can be consolidated to achieve savings, describe the consolidation. Work with
        counterparts at nearby installations to articulate any demand the facility may support from
        nearby installations.
        A3.1.3.6. Operational and Location Description. Describe the operations, programs, or
        activities that the facility will house, how the facility will be operated, and whether the project
        updates, replaces, or create a new program or service. Describe the specific location and the
        major reasons for selecting the location, the adjacent community type facilities, identified public
AFI32-1022    20 MAY 2009                                                                             45


     interest in the project, and the number of military installations in the commuting area with a
     similar facility.
     A3.1.3.7. Prospective Customers. Identify the prospective patron base by group (military
     members and their families, retirees and their families, Defense civilians, etc.) who are expected
     to use the facility, the expected number of customers, the proximity of the customer base, and the
     method used to validate the patron base and market demand.
     A3.1.3.8. Alternatives. Describe the alternative methods of providing the service that were
     considered and the rationale for discarding them. Identify alternative funding sources and the
     rationale for the selected source of funding. Should the proposed funding deviate from the DoD
     prescribed source, provide the supporting rationale for a policy waiver
     A3.1.3.9. Public-Private Venture (PPV) Assessment. In accordance with DoD Instruction
     1015.13 and DoDI 7700.18, para E3.1.5.2, PPV contracts shall be considered for NAF capital
     requirements over $1,000,000 for NAF Category C facilities. Submit documentation of the PPV
     assessment which should be contained in the Project Validation Assessment (PVA).
     A3.1.3.10. Project Validation Assessment (PVA). Submit the executive summary for the PVA
     with the individual project documentation.
     A3.1.3.11. Design Data. If other than a traditional design/construction process is used, submit a
     brief explanation of the process and how the design/construction cost was estimated.
     A3.1.3.12. Financial Analysis. Furnish the Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return (IRR),
     and Payback calculations on the Installation Commander’s Certificate. The three calculations
     shall be based on the same life cycle. Show the cash flow in a level of detail that will permit
     replication and interpretation of the financial data. Note whether the analysis is based on total
     project cash flows or the incremental cash flow attributable to the project and the rationale for
     the method used.
     A3.1.3.13. Single-Line Drawing. Use DD Form 1391c. Prepare the drawing in enough detail to
     show location, scope, and dimensions of the work. If the work involves alteration to an existing
     facility, show the existing facility and identify the work required with functional relationship to
     the new facility. Provide a symbol key.
     A3.1.3.14. Detailed Cost Estimate. Use DD Form 1391c. Develop a detailed cost estimate
     base on 35 percent or greater design. Show cost estimates for furnishings, furniture, and
     equipment in "lump sum" with a total for each category in Block 9 of the DD Form 1391. If
     costs for supporting facilities are unusually high because of extensive site preparation, utilities,
     parking, walks, curbs, landscaping, and so forth, an accompanying explanation must justify the
     costs. Include the foreign currency exchange rate. Details are provided in Attachment 5 for
     completing DD Form 1391s where applicable.

                                     PREPARING DD FORMS 1391

A5.1. Preparing the 1391. Use the following directions to prepare DD Form 1391s for all projects
funded from NAF. Since the DD Form 1391 is the basis on which individual projects and some Air
Force-wide programs are justified and approved, they must be carefully prepared to provide complete,
accurate, and essential information. The project documents must provide a complete word picture of the
work planned and the reason for the work. For phased work, a clear description of the ultimate goal of
the phased program should be included. The appropriate authority must approve project documents on
the front sheet DD Form 1391 or DD Form 1391c for each facility project.
All of the 1391s and 1391c s should be entered into ACES- PM.

BLOCK 1-Component: Enter "AIR FORCE", which is a mandatory entry.
   Title Block: Enter the fiscal year of the funds paying for the project.
  FY___ MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT DATA

BLOCK 2-Date: The date block should be left blank.

BLOCK 3-Installation and Location: Put the name of the installation and the state or country where
it’s located. Also, enter the name of the installation where work will be done if it is an off-base site. The
type of the base should be stated as Air Force Base, Air Base, Air National Guard, or Air Reserve Base
after the name.

BLOCK 4-Project Title: First word will be "Maintain", "Repair", ―Construct‖, or ―Add.‖. Make it
clear what the work is to do. Include all work classifications associated with each project . Be sure to
use the name of the facility in the title not just the facility number (i.e. Add to and Repair Bowling
Center, Bldg 1).

BLOCK 5-Program Element: Use NAF for Nonappropriated funds, PVT for private organizations or
AAFES for Army and Air Force Exchange Service.

BLOCK 6-Category Code: Show the six-digit code for the real property facilities.

References:

Categories described in Chapter 3,

Automated Air Force Pricing Guide,

AFCESA Category Code Listing,

AF Corporate Data Dictionary available through Defense Data Network.

BLOCK 7-Project Number: This number is locally assigned and should be consistent with the
Automated Civil Engineer System (ACES)-Project Management module.
AFI32-1022      20 MAY 2009                                                                                51


BLOCK 8-Project Cost: While NAF does not have element of expense investment codes (EEICs), you
can still use the codes to identify the classification of work. Show the EEIC or work class and total
funded project cost, for example EEIC 529 - $000K, or minor construction - $000K.

This value must be same as ―Total Request (Rounded)‖ on Block 9.
Maintenance/Repair and Minor Construction projects should be identified separately.
Project documentation should clearly specify project cost for each EEIC being used to fund the proposed
work.

BLOCK 9-Cost Estimates: This section provides for a breakout of costs by identifiable elements of
work including design, construction, collateral equipment, antiterrorism/force protection, restoration,
modernization, companion projects, appropriated fund supporting projects and other associated costs,
regardless the funding source. Refer to Attachment 1, AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and
Procedures and Attachment 1, AFI 32-1022 for a detailed breakout of funded versus unfunded costs.
Show Overhead and Profit (OH&P) expenses here as funded costs (when appropriate), however, do not
show a line item with a zero cost. Use local experience for amount. Show Supervision, Inspection, and
Overhead (SIOH) and Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment (FF&E) as applicable.

Primary facility, which is the first item, should match the ―Project Title‖ (Block 4). For projects like
visiting quarters include the number of personnel to be housed in parenthesis.

Sustainable Design and Development (SDD) and Energy. SDD and energy costs should be included
as a separate line item under ―Primary Facility.‖ Document Sustainable Development Policy, EPAct05,
EO13423 and EISA07 costs. These costs will be programmed at no more than 2% of the primary
facility costs unless specific detailed costs are determined. When the costs exceed 2% an explanation
will be provided in block 10. Energy costs will be supported by a Building Life Cycle Cost (BLCC)
analysis using the BLCC software developed by the Department of Energy and results of the analysis
will be entered in ACES-PM.

Antiterrorism Force Protection should be included as a separate line item under ―Primary Facility.‖
AT/FP costs in excess of 3% of the primary facility cost need to be justified in Block 11. See UFC 04-
010-01 for specific AT/FP guidance.

For CONUS projects, AT/FP should be 0.5-1.0% of Primary Facility.
For OVERSEAS projects AT/FP should be 0.5-3.0% of Primary Facility.

Supporting Facilities Supporting Facilities cost in excess of 20% of the Primary Facility cost need to be
justified in Block 11. Supporting Facilities include only the following:

Utilities,

Site Improvement,

Pavements,

Communications.

Subtotal is the sum of primary and secondary facility costs.
52                                                                       AFI32-1022      20 MAY 2009



Contingency is normally 5% of the Subtotal. Rates in excess of 5% should be justified in Block11.

Total contract cost is the sum of the Subtotal and Contingency.

Supervision, Inspection and Overhead (SIOH) fee is charged by the design/construction
agent/manager. This is calculated as a certain percentage of the Total Contract Cost.

CONUS projects via US Army Corps of Engineers or Navy is 5.7%

USAFE projects located in the United Kingdom is 5%

USAFE projects other than United Kingdom is 6.5%

Overseas projects via US Army or US Navy is also 6.5%

Ensure there are no mathematical errors in the cost estimate. Design costs are unfunded. Ensure cost
estimate uses current inflation indices to bring appropriate project costs into the year of expected
execution (especially for phased work). Provide a separate cost estimate for companion maintenance,
repair, minor construction projects, unfunded design costs, and unfunded Furniture, Fixture and
Equipment (FF&E). Include demolition costs if appropriate and applicable.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate: Enter the rate used, when applicable.

Total PA Request (Rounded): Round project cost (the PA not Total NAF investment) to the nearest
thousand.

Rounding Rules:

Project Cost             Round To Nearest
Less than $1M               $10,000
$1M to $5M                  $50,000
$5M to $10M                 $100,000
$10M to $20M                $200,000
Over $20M                   $1,000,000

BLOCK 10-Description of Proposed Work: Describe the major work planned by work classification.
When a NAF project has a companion APF project, ensure each project references the other related
project. NAF minor construction work should be on a separate project number; however, ensure that
each project’s programming document(s) reference other related projects. For phased work, describe the
work included in each phase. Be succinct, but descriptive. Units of measure shall be expressed in metric
units.

BLOCK 11-Requirement: The REQUIREMENT is the total size (SM, LS, UN, EA, etc) necessary to
fulfill the mission. ADEQUATE represents an existing facility or portion of that can be used to meet the
REQUIREMENT. SUBSTANDARD represents the facility or facilities that cannot be used (and will
normally be demolished).
AFI32-1022      20 MAY 2009                                                                              53


Requirement: Tell what the project will provide, including the ultimate goal for a phased project. Be
specific and ensure the description of the requirement coincides with the classification of work. Avoid
use of verbs or other language, which would indicate another work classification. For example, ―install‖
and ―replace‖ may give the idea that work is new (e.g. construction) whereas ―upgrade‖ would likely
indicate repair class work.

The current situation: Include age of the facility or associated components; general conditions of the
items requiring work; energy conservation or environmental considerations; current impact to
installation mission; etc.

Impact if the project is not provided: Include any information, which helps form a word picture of why
this project is necessary, state if this project if economically feasible, and the impacts if not
accomplished.

Additional: Includes any additional information such as related AFIs or AFMs supporting this kind of
facility at this location, and state if this project is economically feasible according to the PVA.

This section should include estimated date for the design start, the estimated percent of the design to be
completed as of July 1, date the design to be 100% completed, date construction contracts to be
awarded, and date the construction is to be completed.

       activities that the facility shall house, how the facility shall be operated, and whether the project
       updates, replaces, or creates a new program or service. Describe the specific location and the
       major reasons for selecting the location, the adjacent community-type facilities (including
       projects that are planned or under design/construction), public interest in the project, a summary
       of a local business reaction to Category C projects, and the military installations in the
       commuting area with a similar facility.
       A5.2.4.2. Prospective Customers. Identify the prospective patron base by group (military
       members and their families, retirees and their families, Defense civilians, etc), expected number
       of customers, the proximity of the customer base, and the PVA method used to validate the
       patron base and market demand.
       A5.2.4.3. Alternatives and Identification of Waiver Requests. Describe the alternative
       methods of providing the service that were considered and the rationale for discarding them.
