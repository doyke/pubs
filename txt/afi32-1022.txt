                                           Chapter 1

                                         OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is to provide instruction and guidance for those
responsible for planning, developing, and submitting nonappropriated fund (NAF) projects to
approving authorities in compliance with public law as well as Department of Defense (DoD),
and Air Force Instructions. NAF projects are funded with monies not appropriated by Congress,
such as private donations, Army and Air Force Exchange (AAFES) dividends, Defense
Commissary Agency (DeCA) surcharges, and revenue generated from Services Morale, Welfare,
and Recreation (MWR) or lodging activities.
1.2. Principles.
   1.2.1. Project Planning. Project planning identifies projects needed to satisfy current and
   future Air Force Services and AAFES program requirements and determines the facilities
   required and the most economical means of fulfilling those requirements. This determination
   shall always include evaluating whether to construct new, add to and alter, renovate, or repair
   the needed facilities. Construction of new square footage should only be considered upon
   completion of a NAF Project Validation Assessment (PVA). The PVA takes into account
   SRM costs for existing facilities, demolition of existing facilities, consolidation, market
   demand, Public-Private Venture, and other alternatives to provide programs and services.
   1.2.2. Project Programming. NAF programming is the process of acquiring both the
   approval/authority and funding/resources necessary to perform the planned work.
1.3. Responsibilities.
   1.3.1. Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Environment, Safety and
   Infrastructure (SAF/IEE). Provides Air Force policy and oversight for the planning,
   programming, and execution of maintenance, repair, and construction programs for NAF
   facilities and recreation sites, and approves certain waivers. Submits the annual NAF
   construction report to Congress in accordance with DoDI 7700.18.
   1.3.2. The Director of Civil Engineers (AF/A4C). AF/A4C provides programming
   guidance, oversight, and policy as required. AF/A4C develops policy and oversees execution
   of NAF facility projects. AF/A4C obtains waivers and exceptions to fund sources and space
   criteria, and coordinates project approval in accordance with this AFI. AF/A4CF prepares
   the NAF Construction Report to Congress and submits it through the Secretary of the Air
   Force to the Office of the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness)
   (OSD (P&R)). AF/A4CF, in coordination with AFPC/SV, manages the programming and
   execution of the AF NAF construction program and is a member of the Air Force Services
   Council and the NAF Facilities Panel. AF/A4CF provides policy, guidance and direction to
   the MAJCOMs and the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) as the Design
   Manager/Construction Manager (DM/CM).
   1.3.3. Director of Services (AF/A1S). Develops policy and facility programs sourced by
   NAF consistent with Air Force Facility Standards (Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 32-1084,
   Facilities Requirements). Advocates resource allocation and programs and exercises
   oversight over approved funding to ensure use is in accordance with authorized parameters of
6                                                           AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014


    the annual Air Force-wide NAF construction program. AF/A1S provides oversight through
    trend analyses and policy revisions. The Director of Services contributes to readiness and
    improves productivity through programs promoting fitness, esprit de corps, and quality of life
    for AF people. The directorate provides policy and direction for worldwide Services
    programs which includes fitness, peacetime and wartime feeding, lodging, libraries,
    mortuary, child development and youth programs, a wide array of recreation and revenue
    producing MWR activities like golf, bowling and clubs. AF/A1S is a member of the Air
    Force Services Council.
    1.3.4. Major Commands (MAJCOMs). MAJCOMs provide oversight to ensure
    compliance with law and DoD and Air Force policies. MAJCOMs review project
    documentation for accuracy if required after approval by Air Force Personnel Center,
    Services Division (AFPC/SV) and AF/A4C. MAJCOMs are responsible for establishing
    quality standards; providing command-unique guidance to supplement Air Force policies,
    procedures, and instructions; validating requirements identified by their installations;
    developing and advocating command budgets for Sustainment, Restoration and
    Modernization (SRM) projects through centralized and MAJCOM programs; and ensuring
    installation compliance with this AFI. The ANG and AFRC Civil Engineer perform these
    MAJCOM functions for their installations.
    1.3.5. Air Force Manpower, Personnel, and Services (AF/A1). AF/A1 serves as the
    senior Air Force representative to the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES)
    Board of Directors and is the final Air Force reviewer of AAFES project viability packages
    submitted for Air Force project viability confirmation.
    1.3.6. Air Force Personnel Center, Services Directorate (AFPC/SV). AFPC/SV oversees
    and develops procedures to implement the Air Force NAF Facilities Program. AFPC/SV
    validates requirements identified by bases by arranging and conduction independent PVAs.
    The AFPC/SV is responsible for ensuring designs are within AF criteria and meet operational
    and functional standards. They also establish functional and operational standards for MWR
    and Lodging facilities. The AFPC/SV facilitates the AF NAF Facilities Panel as well as
    maintains records of all Panel meetings and actions. They obtain project funding approval,
    provide financial oversight, and perform financial analysis related to proposed expenditures.
    They execute Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite-Quality (IDIQ) contracts in support of project
    design and execution and provides assistance on NAF purchasing issues. Finally, the
    AFPC/SV provides technical clarification and functional assistance to installations on NAF
    capital improvement issues, and evaluates completed projects for financial, functional, and
    operational effectiveness. (T-2)
    1.3.7. Installation Commander. The Installation Commander, assisted by the Civil
    Engineer Squadron Commander/Base Civil Engineer, is responsible and accountable to
    ensure all work accomplished for the Air Force on Air Force owned/controlled real property
    is properly authorized and funded in accordance with all laws, policies, and regulations. (T-
    2) The Installation Commander is also responsible for ensuring the effective and efficient
    use of Air Force real property; and planning and programming all NAF-funded minor
    military construction and maintenance and repair for real property requirements necessary to
    properly support assigned missions and people (including tenants) and to care for and
    preserve Air Force real property. See AFI 32-9005, Real Property Accountability and
AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   7


  Reporting, and paragraph 1.2.9 of AFI 34-205, Services Nonappropriated Fund Facility
  Projects, for additional information. (T-2)
  1.3.8. ANG and AFRC Installations and Services Facilities. The ANG and AFRC should
  rely on local community programs and facilities for Services activities and other community
  support to the maximum extent possible. The ANG and AFRC should provide only activities
  where there is significant demand not addressed locally which may include sports fields and
  courts; dining hall; lodging; physical fitness; multipurpose recreation; sports and recreation
  equipment checkout; and consolidated club that offers an on-site feeding capability.
     1.3.8.1. Services Activities Already in Operation. The ANG and AFRC may continue
     to operate other Services activities that were operating as of September 30, 1991, as long
     as funding is adequate and they do not inhibit the operation of other programs with
     significant demand.
     1.3.8.2. Other Community Support Activities. Limited exchange facilities are
     authorized. The size of these facilities and the scope of operation are based on the
     military population supported, and accessibility of active duty exchange facilities. The
     exchange service must also demonstrate the cost benefit of these activities.
     Commissaries are not authorized unless special circumstances warrant.
     1.3.8.3. Adding New Services Activities. The ANG and AFRC may add new activities
     when justified by patron analysis and approved by the Air Staff functional manager.
     AF/A1S is the approval authority for adding new Services NAF programs.
     1.3.8.4. Closing Services Activities. The ANG and AFRC will follow the appropriate
     Air Staff guidance when closing any Services activities per AFI 34-201, Use of
     Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs), and AFI 34-101, Air Force Morale, Welfare, and
     Recreation (MWR) Programs and Use Eligibility. (T-1)
  1.3.9. Headquarters Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES). Determines and
  approves policies, plans, and programs pertaining to AAFES. HQ AAFES decides annual
  financial plans and goals; monitors, reviews, and recommends approval of construction
  projects; oversees cost of all AAFES projects; and provides to Chief of Staff and Secretary of
  the Air Force annual and quarterly reports, as appropriate.
  1.3.10. Headquarters Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC). Serves as the DM/CM
  for NAF Major Construction projects. AFCEC, as the Air Force’s center of excellence for
  design and construction, is the decision authority on execution strategy, and coordinates with
  AFPC/SV for configuration control/change management, and financial accounting. (T-2)
  AFCEC will manage design and construction in coordination with AFPC/SV. (T-2) When
  mutually agreed upon with AFPC/SV, AFCEC may act as the Design and Construction
  Agents (DA/CA) and is responsible for the technical execution of project design and
  construction.
  1.3.11. Design and Construction Agent (DA/CA). The DA/CA is the DoD component
  responsible for the technical execution of project construction and performs the duties of the
  CO. The DA/CA for NAF Major Construction projects can be the U.S. Army Corps of
  Engineers (USACE), Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), AFCEC,
  AFPC/SV, or host base.

                    PLANNING NONAPPRORIATED FUND PROJECTS

2.1. Nonappropriated Fund Projects. Nonappropriated funds provide facilities that improve
the morale and welfare of Air Force personnel and family members by providing enhanced
recreation, services, and resale activities and programs that are not authorized for construction
with congressionally appropriated funds. Nonappropriated fund projects are funded with monies
not appropriated by Congress such as private donations, AAFES dividends, DeCA surcharges,
and revenue generated from Services MWR or lodging activities.
2.2. Planning Actions. Effective planning establishes project requirements and proposes the
most effective and economical means of satisfying those requirements. The process described in
this paragraph does not apply to AAFES project planning.
     2.2.1. Determine Requirement. Installations identify programs that promote fitness, esprit
     de corps, and quality of life for AF people and the facilities needed for them. Installation
     Commanders review, validate, and prioritize these needs.
     2.2.2. Evaluate Alternative Solutions. Installations evaluate existing assets and determine
     the most beneficial and cost effective programs promoting fitness, esprit de corps, and
     quality of life for AF personnel. AFPC/SV is the OPR for conducting an operational and
     financial analysis in accordance with AFI 34-205. For NAF facility projects costing
     $200,000 or more, AFPC/SV conducts a PVA in accordance with AFI 34-205.
        2.2.2.1. Proposed NAF projects require compliance with the National Environmental
        Policy Act (NEPA), prior to irrevocable or irretrievable commitment of resources. The
        proponent is responsible for compliance with the Environmental Impact Analysis Process
        (EIAP), AFI 32-7061 as promulgated at Title 32 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.)
        989, Environmental Impact Analysis Process. (T-0)
        2.2.2.2. The proponent initiates the EIAP via the AF Form 813, Request for
        Environmental Impact Analysis Process. Ensure all NAF projects comply with Title 32
        C.F.R. 989 and that all supporting decisions are consistent with the results of the EIAP.
        The Certificate of Compliance for the EIAP is summarized in the Department of Defense
        Form (DD Form) 1391. (T-0)
     2.2.3. Initiate Programming Actions. When it is determined a facility project is required,
     the Civil Engineer Squadron will prepare appropriate documentation for approval (see
     Attachment 3), and enter the project into the Civil Engineering data management system.
     Documentation (typically obtained from facility users) shall include a fully justified case for
     accomplishing the project. (T-2) Definitions of the terms used to identify project costs
     (funded, unfunded, excluded) are defined in Attachment 1.
     2.2.4. Air Force Base Capital Improvement Fund (AFBCIF) Project
     Submission. Details on AFBCIF project submission, validation, and funding are provided in
     AFI 34-205. Projects competing for Air Force central NAF funds are submitted by the
     Installations in accordance with the “Call for Proposed Fiscal Year (FY) Air Force Base
     Capital Improvement Fund (AFBCIF) Facility Projects” issued by AFPC/SV. Projects are
     submitted by the base Force Support Squadron Deputy (FSS/CD) and must have a completed
AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                      9


   DD Form 1391, FY Military Construction Project Data Sheet, and a completed Internal
   Needs Validation Study (INVS), and for Category C activities a proforma financial analysis.
   (T-2) The Air Force NAF Facilities Panel (Panel) reviews submissions and recommends
   projects for PVA studies. Based upon the PVA recommendation and available funding, the
   Panel recommends projects to proceed to 65% design for inclusion in the annual submission
   to OSD(P&R). AF/A1S is the approval authority for PVAs and design funding. Vice Chief of
   Staff of the Air Force (VCSAF) is the funding approval authority for AFBCIF NAF
   construction funding. The MAJCOM Commander (MAJCOM/CC) is the funding approval
   authority for local (base) or MAJCOM funded projects.
2.3. Certificate of Compliance. For construction projects, installations ensure planning actions
are accomplished by completing a Certificate of Compliance for Critical Planning Actions
document (see Attachment 3 for project documentation requirements). (T-1) See AFI 32-1021
Planning and Programming Military Construction (MILCON) Projects, for details on the
certificate.
2.4. Project Validation Assessment (PVA). A PVA must validate all NAF maintenance,
repair, and construction projects costing $200,000 and greater. See AFI 34-205 for additional
guidance. The Installation Commander and AFPC/SV must ensure a PVA is accomplished. (T-
2) A PVA is the process used to formally collect data, document facts, determine projected
demand, and analyze results to help make a decision. It verifies customer demand, analyzes site
and collocation possibilities, and calculates financial viability "payback." A PVA considers
alternatives, weighs new construction versus addition or alteration, proposes acquisition
resources and methods (such as design-build, design-bid- build, etc.) and analyzes competition to
determine project requirements.
2.5. Facilities. Facilities should be consistent with the Installation Development Plan (IDP), and
with installation/MAJCOM policies. Use of pre-engineered buildings is encouraged when they
can reduce costs.. Reference AFMAN 32-1084, Facility Requirements, and AF/A4C approved
design guides for space criteria. Actual project scope for NAF constructed facilities will be
determined by a valid market assessment/economic analysis, usually in the form of a PVA.
Design and space criteria waivers are submitted to AF/A4CF for Deputy Assistant Secretary of
the Air Force (Environment, Safety and Infrastructure) and AF/A1S consideration. Reference
AFMAN 32-1084 for specific waiver guidance. Base Civil Engineers or AFCEC DM/CM shall
ensure sustainable development concepts are applied in the planning, design, construction,
environmental management, operation, maintenance, and disposal of facilities and infrastructure
projects, consistent with mission requirements. Sustainable principles shall be integrated into the
design, development, and construction of the project in accordance with Executive Order 13423
and all other applicable laws and Executive Orders. (T-0)
2.6. Site Considerations. The site refers to the portion of land adequately sized to contain the
facility and related functions. The site should include area for landscaping, parking, and
essential open and buffer areas, e.g. AT standoff. Site boundaries are established as boundary
encompassing facility footprint, paved walkways and parking areas, essential open or buffer
zones and, AT standoff areas. Make sure the site is consistent with the IDP (see AFI 32-7062,
Air Force Comprehensive Planning, for details) and agrees with the PVA recommendation.
AFPC/SVX must approve any site changes after the PVA validation. (T-2)

  2.6.1. Site Clearance. Planning site clearance shall be identified in the PVA. Strive to
  provide a clean site for the construction of a NAF facility; APFs may be used for this
  purpose. A clean site is defined as a site free from any man-made conditions or structures
  such as buried underground storage tanks and utilities that interfere with the facility
  construction. The demolition of existing manmade structures both above and below ground
  in conjunction with the construction of a NAF facility may be accomplished with APFs and
  programmed as an APF companion project. (T-1) If APF is used for a clean site it must be
  approved by AF/A4C. The approval package should include a DD Form 1391, a site plan
  showing the location of all sites considered, and a detailed analysis that includes a strong
  justification for the site’s selection. (T-1)
     2.6.1.1. If the cost of the clean site requirements, which includes site investigation costs,
     exceeds 15% of the NAF project cost or $750,000, whichever is less, APFs must be
     approved through AFCEC by AF/A4C. (T-2) The approval package should include the
     DD Form 1391 (see paragraph 2.2.4), site plan showing the location of all sites
     considered, and a detailed analysis that includes a strong justification for the site’s
     selection.
  2.6.2. Building Disposal. Dispose of older substandard facilities as new structures are built.
  (T-2) Follow AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property, for disposal action guidance. If the
  installation is not going to dispose of the building, the installation must ensure the DD Form
  1391 and DD Form 1391c, FY Military Construction Project Data (Continuation,) provide
  clear justification for retention. (T-2) If an existing facility is identified for disposal during
  the approval process, and an Air Force centrally funded project is approved to replace the
  facility, AF/A1S must approve the continued use of the facility for a NAF activity. (T-1)
  The Civil Engineer Squadron Commander/Base Civil Engineer is responsible for
  programming facility disposal or reuse in accordance with AFI 32-9004. (T-1) Retain
  facilities should be consistent with the IDP, and with installation/MAJCOM policies.
  2.6.3. Discovery of Environmental Contamination. The removal and disposal of
  contamination unexpectedly encountered within the actual disturbed volume of the project
  footprint during the execution of the project must be funded with NAF. (T-1) In addition, the
  cost for anticipated removal and disposal of contamination within the project footprint shall
  be included in the DD Form 1391. (T-1)

                 PROGRAMMING NONAPPROPRIATED FUND PROJECTS

3.1. Fund Sources for NAF Projects. Facility categories are a primary factor in determining
the proper fund source for NAF projects. Use Tables 3.1 through 3.6 to determine the facility
category and fund source. The three identifiable categories or groupings of MWR facilities are
Category-A: Mission Sustaining Activities; Category-B: Basic Community Support Activities;
and Category-C: Revenue Generating Activities. In addition there are lodging facilities as a
separate non-MWR category. A discussion of each follows:
    3.1.1. Category A—Mission Sustaining Activities. These programs promote the physical
    and mental well-being of military personnel. They are required to support the basic military
    mission and are funded with APFs. Restrict use of NAFs to specific instances where the law
    or policy limits APFs. Programs in this category have virtually no capacity for generating
    NAF revenues. Table 3.1 shows the fund source for this category and type of the facilities:

Table 3.1. Category A − Mission Sustaining Activities Fund Source.

 NOTES:
 1. Use of NAFs for construction requires an OSD(P&R) waiver to fund source. (T-0)
 2. Use of NAFs for maintenance and repair requires a waiver to fund source from SAF/FMCEB. Send requests to
 USAF/A4CF for staffing through appropriate offices for SAF/FMCEB. (T-1)
 3. For environmental compliance work, coordinate with AFCEC environmental offices to determine proper
 source of funding. SAF/FM will not consider a request for a waiver to the environmental compliance construction
 fund source. (T-1)
 4. Fund playing courts and fields with APFs, if most of the following conditions exist: a.) They are the only ones
 on base (i.e., a small installation); b.) Attached to the gym; c.) Detached from the gym, but operated by the gym
 staff; d.) Reserved for only military personnel during peak use times, e.g., noon hour; e.) Located in the dormitory
 area for use by active duty military personnel; and f.) Periodically closed to open play to host intramural or
 varsity-type tournaments. (T-3)

5. Skateboard Parks: if the skateboard park is constructed within an existing park and picnic area, then it is
classified as a Category A and APFs are the proper fund source; if constructed as a stand-alone facility (indoor
or outdoor) or as part of youth center, then it is classified as a Category B facility and NAFs are the proper fund
source. (T-3)
6. For Cat Code 740-3XX, reference the Type of Facility to determine which Table (3.1, 3.2 or 3.3) to apply.
7. Applies to NAF facilities if title transferred to APF.
   3.1.2. Category B − Basic Community Support Activities. These programs support the
   military mission by satisfying the basic physiological and psychological needs of military
   members and their families. They provide community support systems for the mobile
   military population. These programs differ from those in Category A, in part, because of
   their limited ability to generate NAF revenues. Approved remote and isolated locations have
   additional Category B APF support; see paragraph 3.9, and Attachment 2-paragraph 2.3
   for details.

NOTES:
1. OSD(P&R) must approve a waiver to fund source if the construction fund source shown is not used. AF/A4CF
routes waiver requests to SAF/FMCEB to use NAFs for maintenance and repair. (T-0)
2. Includes the reconfiguration of a facility, e.g., the addition, rearrangement, or removal of non load-bearing
walls, modification of Heating, Ventilation, & Air Conditioning (HVAC), electrical, or other systems/components
to restore a building to functional standards, i.e., to make a facility fully functional and capable of supporting
activities and programs effectively and efficiently. Includes maintenance and repair of bowling lanes and
pinsetters at remote and isolated and Category B bowling centers. Per AFI 65-106, addition, rearrangement, or
removal of non load-bearing walls is subject to availability of APFs; no SAF/FM waiver to fund source is
required to use NAFs. (T-0)
3. Except for Child Development Centers and Youth Facilities Overseas, use NAFs for all construction
environmental compliance. Use non-environmental quality APFs for all maintenance and repair environmental
compliance requirements. SAF/FM will not consider a waiver request to the environmental compliance
construction class. (T-1)

4. Fund construction of playing courts and fields with NAFs if most of the following conditions exist:
a.) Part of a NAF youth center program. b.) For primary use by residents (not particularly military). c.) Not
operated as part of the gym program. d.) Do not offer special times for military preference. (T-1)
5. Category A Skateboard Parks: if constructed within an existing park and picnic area APFs are the proper fund
source, if constructed as a stand-alone facility (indoor or outdoor) or as part of youth center, then it’s classified as
a Category B facility and NAFs are the proper fund source. (T-1)
6. For Cat Code 740-3XX, reference the Type of Facility to determine which Table (3.1, 3.2 or 3.3) to apply.

  NOTES:
  1. In accordance with AFI 65-106, APFs are not authorized in Category C facilities, except in Remote and
 Isolated locations, for rearrangement or removal of non-load-bearing walls to restore a building to functional
 standards, i.e., to make an existing building fully functional and capable of supporting Category C activities or
 programs effectively and efficiently. NAF must fund this work except in Remote and Isolated locations. (T-1)
  2. Use NAFs for the maintenance and repair of functionally unique items required to support activity
 operations. These items make the facility usable for the activity it contains, but are not considered part of
 the normal facility system. See Attachment 2 for examples. (T-1)
  3. For Remote and Isolated Locations: APFs are authorized for Category C functionally unique items
 required to support activity operations (see paragraph 3.9). (T-1)
  4. APFs shall be used outside the United States. (T-1)
  5. Use NAF for AAFES-owned real property and equipment not transferred to the installation. (T-1)
  6. For Cat Code 740-3XX, reference the Type of Facility to determine which Table (3.1, 3.2 or 3.3) to apply.

 NOTES:
 1. Category C (R&I) means Remote and Isolated Locations.
 2. When NAF is the fund source, reimburse work performed by the Civil Engineer Squadron with NAFs. (T-1)
 3. Waivers to fund source not authorized. Report all APFs as direct costs. (T-1)
 4. When a leak is a threat to the environment, detection is an AAFES responsibility. Repair/cleanup is covered
 by environmental APF funds when an upgrade is required to meet new environmental standards. However, if
 there is also an increase in capacity, the portion attributed to the capacity increase will become an AAFES
 responsibility. (T-1)
  3.1.4. Lodging Fund Programming. Although not a separate MWR category, lodging
  facility fund sources have specialized funding considerations. Lodging facilities, except for
  temporary lodging facilities, use the same APF source as Category A activities. APFs are the
  appropriate fund source for environmental compliance. AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund
  Support of Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) and Nonappropriated Fund
  Instrumentalities (NAFIs), provides funding source guidance for all associated expenditures.
  Submit waiver requests for specific cases to SAF/FMC for approval using procedures
  outlined in AFI 65-106, Chapter 6. (T-1)

  NOTES:
  1. The funds shown above are private funds. Do not use APFs or Services NAFs to fund construction of or
  relocation of private organizations. See note 3. (T-0)
  2. See DoD 7000.14-R, Vol. 5, Chap 34 for details on APF support for overseas banks/automatic teller machines
  (ATMs). (T-0)
  3. If the Thrift Shop occupies a Government-owned building, use APFs to maintain and repair the structural
  integrity and systems of the facility and to comply with environmental requirements. Regular maintenance and
  repair of the shop should be funded by the private organization itself. Fund functionally unique items to support
  activity operations with private funds. (T-1) See Attachment 2 for examples of functionally unique items.
  4. The National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB is authorized APFs for
  construction.
  5. For additional funding guidance on museums, see AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force, AFI
  65-601 Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, and AFI 84-103, U.S. Air Force Heritage Program.
3.2. Waiver to Fund Source. The tables in the beginning of this chapter prescribe a single
funding source for all construction regardless of cost; however, occasionally unique situations or
exigencies may require deviation or exception to the basic funding policy. Except as noted
below, authority to waive the fund source remains with the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of
Defense, Personnel and Readiness or PDUSD(P&R). Installation must completely justify
requests for waiver, regardless of cost. AF/A4C, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force
AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     17


(Environment, Safety and Infrastructure), and Office of OSD(P&R) will review these requests on
a case-by-case basis. Support requests with the same programming documentation required for
project approval. Installation must make sure funds are available for the project and are
authorized by the funding authority. Include this information in the waiver request. Show how
and why the waiver is in the best interest of the Air Force. In a limited number of instances,
construction may be funded using more than one source. (T-0)
   3.2.1. Nonappropriated Funding for Projects Normally Funded with APFs. With the
   exception of facilities in support of temporary duty (TDY) travel and outside the continental
   United States (OCONUS) youth center, youth courts, and youth playing fields, OSD(P&R)
   establishes the waiver policy to use NAF in lieu of APFs. (T-0)
       3.2.1.1. Waivers for TDY and OCONUS Youth Facilities. For TDY facilities in
       support of TDY travel (visiting quarters (VQs)) and for OCONUS youth centers, youth
       courts, and youth playing fields, SAF/FMC may approve the use of NAF funding when
       APFs are certified as unavailable. To obtain this certification the MAJCOM must satisfy
       the following criteria: (1) the installation submitted the project to the MAJCOM for
       consideration in its Military Construction (MILCON) (major and minor construction) or
       APF modernization budget; (2) the project was not prioritized high enough to be funded
       within the AFCEC total obligation authority for any APF source; (3) the MAJCOM
       certifies that the project is of higher priority than all other non-funded NAF construction
       and modernization requirements. Waiver requests should be submitted through
       AFPC/SV to AF/A1S, SAF/IEE and SAF/FMB for funding consideration and SAF/FMC
       for approval. The waiver request must include certification that the project meets all three
       criteria. (T-1)
3.3. Appropriated Funding for NAF Facility Requirements. APFs are the appropriate fund
source for facility requirements supporting NAF activities that are driven by restationing actions,
facility relocation for the convenience of the Government, constructing facilities denied by
country-to-country agreements, or if a facility is destroyed by an act of God (see 32 C.F.R.
842.22(a)), by fire, or by terrorism. In these cases, appropriated funds are the appropriate fund
source for both minor and major construction. Do not use APF, MWR, or Lodging funds to
construct or relocate facilities for private organizations. (T-0)
   3.3.1. Establishing, Activating, and Expanding a Military Installation. An expansion
   must be a major increase in authorized and assigned personnel strength over a short period of
   time. For example, a 25 percent increase of assigned personnel over a two year period as
   noted in DoDI 1015.15, Footnote 12, Enclosure 4. Evolutionary expansion over time would
   not qualify. (T-0)
   3.3.2. Relocating Facilities for the Convenience of the Government. When a military
   construction project displaces a NAF activity (to include any Category B or C facility,
   regardless of original fund source), the installation may include the costs of removal,
   relocation, or construction of a replacement for the NAF facility in the military construction
   DD Form 1391 documentation. Replacement facilities could include either newly constructed
   facilities or alteration of existing buildings.       Examples are:      installation-initiated
   consolidations or traffic circulation issues. Another example would be the requirement to
   move facilities out of the Clear Zone/Accident Potential Zone (CZ/APZ). (T-0)
 18                                                          AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014


   3.3.3. Constructing     NAF        Facilities  Denied       by     Country-to-Country
   Agreements. Replacement of facilities denied by country-to-country agreements should be
   submitted for APF consideration. (T-0)
   3.3.4. Facilities Destroyed by Acts of God, Fire, or Terrorism. The following two sub-
   sections detail the conditions under which it is appropriate to fund NAF projects using APFs.
   Do not use APFs for maintenance or repair of facilities and/or land leased or constructed with
   NAFs until the Air Force acquires title to the facilities. (T-1)
       3.3.4.1. Flooding and Acts of God. If an act of God damages or destroys AF NAF
       facilities or grounds, APFs are the appropriate fund source for repair or replacement. For
       example, if a facility sustains storm damage (storm defined as a weather event named by
       the National Weather Service or foreign equivalent), whether in or out of a floodplain, it
       would be considered an act of God. In the case of flooding, this refers to levels that
       exceed the 100-year flood as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
       (FEMA) and where the location is not currently identified as a flood hazard area.
       Additional guidance for golf courses is provided in paragraph 4.5.4 Flood damage from
       lesser events such as seasonal flooding or erosion would not be considered an act of God.
       However, if flooding is widespread, e.g. flooding that impacts several different facilities
       on base, then it may be considered for APFs to restore the damage. See Attachment 1
       for definition of terms. (T-1)
       3.3.4.2. Facilities Destroyed by Fire or Acts of Terrorism. NAF facilities damaged or
       destroyed by fire or acts of terrorism are eligible for repair/replacement with APF
       funding. Fires caused by negligence, as determined by official incident investigation, are
       a NAF responsibility to fund repair/replacement. (T-1)
   3.3.5. Utility Runs. Public Law authorizes the use of APFs to expand or extend utilities
   from the base system to connect to the site boundaries or nearest manhole, whichever is
   closest to the facility under construction. An exception that would not qualify for
   appropriated funding is long utility runs solely for the irrigation of golf courses.
3.4. Mixing Nonappropriated and Appropriated Fund Construction Funds. Fund all
construction elements from a single fund source--NAFs or APFs, but not a combination of both.
It may be acceptable to co-locate certain APF activities in a NAF facility, for example: a military
clothing sales store in a base exchange, medical pharmacy in a base exchange, or excessive
utility runs and roads from the base system to the site boundary (see Paragraph 3.3.5.). The same
is true for locating NAF activities in an APF facility, for example, a NAF coffee shop in a base
library. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Environment, Safety and
Infrastructure) must approve the use of APFs in a NAF facility and/or NAFs in an APF facility,
regardless of cost. (T-1)
3.5. Host Nation Credits. Host nation credits are entitlements to the US Air Force from the
host nation as goods and services (not money) under a memorandum of understanding executed
by the MAJCOM on behalf of the DoD and the host nation. The installation may fund facility
requirements (maintenance, repair, and construction), normally funded with nonappropriated and
appropriated funds with host nation credits if the installation applies all policies, rules, and
procedures that apply to NAF and APF projects.
AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                      19


3.6. Companion APF and NAF Projects. Combining APF maintenance and repair with a NAF
maintenance and repair or NAF construction project is allowable within certain restrictions and
controls. Title 10 United States Code Section 2492 authorizes the establishment of contracts or
agreements between NAFIs and APF organizations that may serve as a vehicle to provide and
obtain goods and/or services beneficial to the efficient management and operation of the
exchange system or the morale, welfare, and recreation system. Submit separate NAF
documents and APF documents to the proper approval authority. See paragraph 4.4 to view
details on maintenance and repair, and Table 6.2 for maintenance and repair approval levels.
See AFI 32-1032, Planning and Programming Appropriated Fund Maintenance, Repair and
Construction Projects, for details on repair. Comply with the following:
   3.6.1. Separate Schedules. The installation and the NAF activity must make sure there are
   separate work and payment schedules for each funding source. (T-1) These schedules must
   identify the various elements of work in each category (construction or repair) and include
   the costs for each element. (T-1) The installation must explain the separate work (cost
   accounting) schedules for APF and NAF funds in the invitation for bids, include them in the
   bid submittal, and incorporate them into the resulting contract. (T-1) A memorandum of
   agreement (MOA) can be used to allow work to be initially accomplished entirely using one
   fund source provided the schedules are sufficiently separated to allow appropriate
   reimbursement.
   3.6.2. Separate Categories of Work. The base must clearly identify the separate categories
   of work in the contract drawings. (T-1) For all contract change orders, the installation must
   identify changes against the applicable work schedules and compute and fund the costs
   accordingly. (T-1)
3.7. Life Safety Code Compliance Deficiencies. Under the definition of repair (see AFI 32-
1032), use APFs to rectify fire or other life, occupational safety and health code deficiencies, to
include but not limited to, provision of handicap access (Architectural Barriers Act), fire
protection (e.g., fire extinguishers, sprinklers, and alarm systems), and security protection (e.g.,
alarm systems), asbestos abatement, lead-based paint removal, and seismic correction in existing
facilities for all categories (A, B, and C), with the exception of work to support activity
operations (see AFI 65-106, Attachment 2). Security and alarm systems should follow
guidelines set out in the IDP (see AFI 32-7062) and repair or construction work should meet
required Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) standards, current National Fire Protection Association
(NFPA) standards, Occupational Safety & Health Administration standards and AFI 32-2001,
Fire Emergency Services.
3.8. Security and Antiterrorism (AT) Requirements. AT must be incorporated into new
construction projects using the facility’s construction funding source. (T-0) For example, a NAF
funded project to construct a new facility will include all security and AT requirements,
including intrusion detection systems, as a NAF construction expense. These expenses will be
captured as a separate line item. APFs are authorized for AT and security requirements for
repair projects. (T-0) APFs may be used for intrusion detection equipment associated with a
repair project; however, non-standard equipment (e.g. AAFES proprietary systems), or systems
in excess of installation requirements are a NAF funding responsibility. (T-0) AT measures
should comply with guidance in UFC 04-010-01, DoD Antiterrorism/Force Protection
Standards. (T-0) AT requirements should comply with the DoD standards described in DoDI
2000.16, DoD Antiterrorism (AT) Standards. Many of the standards in DoDI 2000.16 are
 20                                                         AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014


applicable to NAF Instrumentalities. For the purposes of this AFI, the construction programmer
should focus specifically on Standards 13, 15, 17, and 18. (T-0)
3.9. Remote and Isolated Locations. The Office of the Secretary of Defense designates certain
installations as remote and isolated locations. With this designation, Category C activities,
including AAFES, at approved locations are authorized Category B level of APF support for
maintenance and repair. This includes rearrangement and removal of non load-bearing walls to
restore a building to functional standards. Follow Tables 3.1 thru 3.4 and paragraph 4.5.4.2
for construction funding guidelines. Do not provide Category B level of APF support for
construction. See Chapter 3 and Table 3.1 of AFI 65-106 for details and a list of these locations.
(T-1)
3.10. Projects Exceeding 75 Percent of Facility Replacement Cost. SAF/IEE must approve if
the repair cost (APF, NAF, or a combination) exceeds 75 percent of the facility replacement cost.
(T-1) Repair work exceeding 75 percent of the replacement cost must be supported by an
economic analysis. In addition, documentation must support why replacement is not in the best
interest of the Government. For guidance regarding development of an economic analysis
reference the AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis. (T-1) See AFI 32-1032 for further guidance.
Facility replacement cost data may be obtained from the installation Civil Engineer.
3.11. Use of Appropriated Funds or Nonappropriated Funds for Maintenance and
Repair. Most maintenance and repair applies to work needed to maintain buildings, grounds,
and facility systems (electrical, mechanical, plumbing, roofing, foundations, windows, doors,
etc.). APFs are the appropriate fund source for this type of maintenance and repair of all
categories (A, B, and C), to include AAFES facilities. Do not use APFs to repair functionally
unique items required to support Category C activities with the exception of Remote and Isolated
locations. (see Attachment 2 for a partial list of items). (T-0) Note that funding for all
nonstandard signage, e.g., those using logos in nonstandard colors, are considered functionally
unique.
   3.11.1. Waivers. If APFs are not available a waiver must be obtained to use NAFs for
   maintenance and repair of all categories. NAFs are the fund source for functionally unique
   items to support Category C activity operations with the exception of Remote and Isolated
   locations. Functionally unique items make the facility usable for the activity it contains, but
   are not considered part of the normal facility system (see Attachment 2 for a partial list of
   items). Also, some work in Category B activities can use NAFs or APFs depending on
   availability of funds without a waiver (See Table 3.2). Also, addition, rearrangement, or
   removal of non load-bearing walls is subject to availability of APFs and does not require a
   waiver to fund source if funds are available (See Table 3.2). Submit waiver requests to
   AF/A4CF for routing through AF/A1SR to SAF/FMCEB. (T-0)
3.12. Sustainable Design and Development (SDD) and Energy. The Air Force is committed
to incorporate sustainable concepts in the planning, programming, design, construction, and
operation of facilities and infrastructure. All construction, renovation and repair projects
regardless of scope, fund source or programmed amount shall comply with the applicable
provisions of Public Law 109-58, Energy Policy Act of 2005; Executive Order (EO) 13423,
Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management; Title 42
United States Code (USC) § 15801, Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; and
Executive Order 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic
AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                21


Performance. (T-0) All new vertical construction and major renovations shall fully incorporate
the Guiding Principles for Federal leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings
(HPSB). (T-1) UFC 1-200-02 Change 2, High Performance and Sustainable Building
Requirements provides guidance regarding HPSB requirements. Additionally, program managers
shall consider and document green alternatives as they develop their specifications and
incorporate green procurement program language into contract statements of work. (T-0)

                                            Chapter 4

                        PROGRAMMING FACILITIES PROJECTS

4.1. Multipurpose Facilities. Commanders should consider constructing multipurpose
facilities, similar to modern municipal recreation centers and college student unions, designed for
optimum use. Most multi-use facilities include revenue-generating activities such as fast food
outlets, delis, dining rooms, concession areas, sports bars, and amusement machines, as well as
mission-sustaining functions (fitness centers, community centers, libraries, etc.). Therefore,
commanders can use a pro-rated share of APFs and NAFs for construction with prior Deputy
Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Environment, Safety and Infrastructure) approval. A
contract or agreement, as discussed in paragraph 3.6, can also be established with approval
from Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Environment, Safety and Infrastructure).
Installations must submit requests to MAJCOMs for transmittal to AF/A4CF, for processing. (T-
1)
4.2. Project Splitting. Installation must not plan a requirement for partial completion with one
project and the remainder of the requirement with a separate project or projects programmed in
successive years. (T-0) This applies to both construction and repair (or combination
maintenance and repair) projects. Identify and program the total known or projected
requirements as a single project. This determines the appropriate project approval level. This is
true whether the projects are planned for simultaneous accomplishment or phased over a period
of years. (T-1)
   4.2.1. Multiple Construction Projects. Treat all known construction work (EEIC 529) on a
   single facility, within a 24-month period, as a single project. The 24-month programming
   period begins upon contract award. The total combined cost determines the approval level;
   if the total cost exceeds $750,000, then Congressional approval is required; see Table 6.1 (T-
   0) MAJCOM/CC funding approval is required for Services projects over $200,000 that are
   funded by the base. AFPC/SV will obtain funding approval for any projects that are funded
   by AF Central Nonappropriated Funds. A DD Form 1391, signed by the MAJCOM Civil
   Engineer is required whenever fund approval is required. (T-1) For AAFES projects, if the
   total cost exceeds $300,000, the MAJCOM Civil Engineer and AAFES Director/Chief
   Executive Officer (CEO) or Senior Vice President for Real Estate must sign the DD Form
   1391. (T-1)
   4.2.2. Multiple Repair Projects. Use the guidance in AFI 32-1032 to determine the total
   repair requirements and subsequent approval level (See Table 6.2). MAJCOM commanders
   and HQ AAFES can approve NAF repair projects up to $2,500,000. See AFI 32-1032,
   Chapter 4 for details.
   4.2.3. Examples.
       4.2.3.1. Officers Clubs. In this example the solution will be a phased approach. An
       officers’ club needs work in various portions of the facility (lounge, kitchen, ballroom,
       restrooms, etc.) but funds are not available to cover the total requirement. Since the
       installation identified all individual requirements, the installation must then consolidate
       them into one project document and seek the appropriate approval authority. The
AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                      23


       installation can then phase execution as feasible within the dollar constraints. Make sure
       each phase is complete and usable.
       4.2.3.2. Recreational Area Cabins. This example illustrates a combined approach.
       Recreation area cabins have deteriorated and require either repair or replacement. The
       installation must combine the total number of cabins programmed for repair into a single
       repair project and the total number of cabins for replacement into a single construction
       project. Approve each project accordingly. The installation may phase the execution
       within funds availability. If there is a requirement for additional cabins, the installation
       must combine this requirement with the cabin replacement requirement in a single
       construction project.
       4.2.3.3. Golf Course Clubhouses. This example is governed by work class cost. A golf
       course clubhouse requires additions to the pro shop and locker room, plus repairs to the
       air conditioning system and replacement of the windows. The installation must combine
       the additions into a single construction project and the air conditioning system and the
       window replacements into a single repair project. The total of each class of work
       determines the individual project approval authority.
4.3. Short-term Facility Requirements. If a NAF construction or repair project generates the
requirement for short-term facilities (temporary or relocatable), use NAFs to pay all costs
associated with the facility programmed as a funded cost of the NAF construction or repair
project. (T-1) If an APF construction or repair project on a NAF facility generates the
requirement for short-term facilities, use APFs to pay all costs associated with the facility
programmed as a funded cost of the APF construction or repair project. (T-1) If a requirement is
generated by both APF and NAF construction or repair work, a temporary facility can be shared
by the APF and NAF activities. (T-1) Costs may be split equitably using a standard measure
such as correlating costs with square footage used. Use AFI 32-1021 for additional guidance on
short-term facilities.
4.4. Appropriated Fund Maintenance and Repair Support to Facilities Leased or
Constructed with Nonappropriated Funds. Do not use APFs for maintenance or repair of
facilities leased or constructed with NAFs until the Air Force acquires title to the facilities. The
AF acquires title through acceptance of the final DD Form 1354, Transfer and Acceptance of
Military Real Property. If the NAF activity, private organization, or a concession retains
ownership (does not apply to AAFES) of the facility, do not use APFs to maintain or repair the
facility or equipment (see Table 3.6). (T-1) However, within available resources, the Civil
Engineer staff may perform maintenance and repair on a reimbursable basis provided beneficial
occupancy is taken and the items are not part of a construction project punchlist. See AFI 32-
9005 for details on transfer of ownership.
4.5. Services Facilities. The MAJCOM has project approval for all construction projects with a
funded cost up to $750,000 and repair projects with a funded cost up to $2,500,000. At the time
of approval, for construction projects (EEIC 529) with a funded cost between $200,000 and
$750,000, the MAJCOM must submit a copy of the approved/signed DD Form 1391 with
signatures from the Civil Engineer Squadron Commander and Installation Commander (front and
signature pages only) to AF/A4CF and AF/A1SR. (T-1) The office of the OSD(P&R) will report
the projects after the fact in the next annual Report to Congress. (T-0) The installation must
submit to the MAJCOM the completed DD Forms 1391 and 1391c, Fiscal Year 20XX Military
 24                                                          AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014


Construction Project Data, for each project with a funded cost over $750,000 in the annual
construction program. (T-1) The MAJCOM submits this information to AF/A4CF for the Report
to Congress. (T-1)
   4.5.1. Supervision, Inspection, and Overhead (SIOH). SIOH is a civil engineer
   responsibility and an APF cost if performed by installation civil engineering (CE) employees
   (includes government and A-76 contractor employees). (T-1) SIOH is a NAF cost if
   performed by contract, Army Corps of Engineers, AFCEC, overhires, or overtime by
   installation CE personnel. (T-1) The execution agency/contracting agency has the authority
   to provide their own Title II services. (T-1) In all other instances, if the installation CE is
   unable to perform SIOH, the AFPC/SV IDIQ Construction Management Inspection Contract
   (Title II Services) should be utilized to ensure lowest cost to the project.
   4.5.2. Design Services. Design is an APF cost if performed by in-house personnel (includes
   government and contractor employees). (T-1) Design is a NAF cost if performed by
   contract; including USACE, AFCEC, NAVFAC; or by overhires. (T-1) Use NAFs to fund
   all contract design services except in the following cases when APFs can be used. (T-1) Use
   published standard designs and design guides as applicable.
      4.5.2.1. An APF-authorized facility construction project has fallen out of a Fiscal Year
      20XX Military Construction Program and the MAJCOM later reprograms it for
      construction with NAFs as a waiver to the DoD funding guidance. (T-1)
      4.5.2.2. The MAJCOM programs a NAF-authorized facility construction project,
      according to DoD policy, in a Fiscal Year 20XX Military Construction Program as a
      waiver to the DoD funding policy. (T-1)
   4.5.3. Design Instruction. For a typical annual program of construction projects with
   funded costs of over $750,000, AFPC/SV will request Design Instructions from AF/A4CF
   through AFCEC to authorize designs to proceed, upon completion of the PVA for centrally
   funded projects. (T-2) Design Instructions for advertisement and award will be managed by
   AFCEC/CF with coordination by AFPC/SV and AF/A4CF. (T-2)
   4.5.4. Golf Courses. NAFs are the normal source of funds for golf courses, maintenance
   facilities, golf clubhouses and parking, and golf cart storage, construction, maintenance, and
   repair. (T-1) APFs may be used for maintenance and repair in certain cases: the clubhouse,
   cart storage facilities attached to a clubhouse, and parking lots. Additionally, base-wide
   services such as mosquito fogging, control of ticks, rats, forest pests, etc., may be provided as
   a common service. As a rule, do not use APFs for golf course grounds maintenance and
   repair. This includes maintenance facilities, latrines, shelters, pump houses, sprinkler
   systems, and driving ranges, etc. Specialized pest control services such as herbicide and
   pesticide treatment of fairways, greens, water hazards, sand traps, etc. may be provided on a
   reimbursable basis.
      4.5.4.1. Golf Course Programming Guidance. For the purpose of construction and
      major repair project approval, divide a golf course into the following separate entities:
          4.5.4.1.1. Golf Course Playing Area (to include the course itself and tee boxes,
          fairways, traps, bunkers, greens, golf cart paths, driving range, practice putting green,
          trees and shrubs, water hazards, shelters, latrines, and snack bars on the course, and
AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   25


        irrigation system –including sprinklers, piping, ponds, water wells, and other
        irrigation appurtenances).
        4.5.4.1.2. Golf Clubhouse (to include parking lot and golf cart storage if the cart
        storage is attached to the clubhouse).
        4.5.4.1.3. Maintenance Facilities (program each building with a separate facility
        number as a separate project). This includes golf cart storage facilities that are not
        attached to the clubhouse.
     4.5.4.2. Remote and Isolated Locations. OSD(P&R) officially designates certain
     installations as "remote and isolated" locations. With this designation, the installation
     may increase the use of APFs to maintain golf course facilities. (T-0) The following
     breaks out the appropriate fund source for various golf course requirements at remote and
     isolated locations.
        4.5.4.2.1. Appropriated Fund Support. APFs are authorized for routine golf
        course grounds maintenance and repair at remote and isolated locations. Routine
        grounds maintenance and repair includes mowing of grass, maintaining
        greens/tees/fairways, irrigating, applying fertilizer and soil amendments, verticutting
        greens, aerating, top dressing of greens, green collars and tees, over seeding, repairing
        damaged areas, weeding, removing debris, providing routine maintenance of
        maintenance facilities, cart storage facilities, latrines and shelters, cart paths and
        bridges, course maintenance facilities, changing holes, marking the course,
        maintaining trees and shrubs, maintaining sand traps and bunkers, maintaining water
        hazards, maintaining irrigation distribution systems, controlling erosion, applying
        pest control products as needed, controlling pest, and restoring grounds destroyed by
        fire or acts of God.
        4.5.4.2.2. Nonappropriated Fund Support. For exceptionally large repair projects,
        such as when SAF/IEE approval is required, NAFs are the appropriate fund source for
        additions, alterations, and replacements to the golf course playing area and golf
        maintenance facilities either by contract or reimbursement to APFs at remote and
        isolated locations. Also use NAFs to construct golf clubhouses and cart storage
        facilities.
     4.5.4.3. Unrelated Costs. APFs are the appropriate fund source for maintenance costs
     for facilities or environmental features adjacent to or within the boundaries of the golf
     course that would exist if the golf course was not there. Do not report these costs in golf
     course maintenance. This includes, but is not limited to, perimeter roads, drainage
     ditches, culverts, fences, structures, cemeteries, tree removal, waterways, or
     appurtenances (power lines, runway approach lights, etc.).
     4.5.4.4. Damage due to Act of God, Fire, or Terrorism. APFs may be used to restore
     grounds destroyed by acts of God (hurricane, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, etc), fire, or
     terrorism. In the case of flooding, this refers to levels that exceed the 100-year flood as
     defined by FEMA and where the location is not currently identified as a flood hazard
     area, refer to 44 C.F.R. 72, Procedures and Fees for Processing Map Changes. Do not
     use APFs to correct situations such as recurrent flooding (except where the course
     controls base water run-off during storms), or normal erosion of a river or creek
 26                                                       AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014


       exacerbated by an above normal amount of rain or snow. Repair of vandalism does not
       qualify for APF funding under this section.
4.6. Temporary Lodging Facilities. Use lodging funds from the NAF account centrally
managed by the AFPC/SV for all construction and minor construction projects with related
furnishings. AFI 65-106 provides the funding source guidance for all associated expenditures.
A PVA must validate all NAF construction projects costing $200,000 and greater. The
Installation Commander and AFPC/SV must ensure a PVA is accomplished. (T-2) AFPC/SV
identifies and prioritizes projects for Air Force central funding. AFPC/SV notifies bases that
they have a funded project and must submit the project in accordance with NAF facilities
policies. Bases submit complete DD Forms 1391 and 1391c, Fiscal Year 20XX Military
Construction Project Data. (T-1) The MAJCOM/A4 (Civil Engineer) provides project approval
for NAF construction projects up to $750,000 and NAF repair projects up to $2,500,000. (T-1)
At the time of approval, for construction projects costing between $200,000 and $750,000, the
MAJCOM must submit a copy of the approved/signed DD Form 1391 (front and signature pages
only) to AF/A4CF and AF/A1SR. (T-1) The office of OSD (P&R) reports the projects after the
fact to Congress in the next annual NAF Report to Congress. (T-0) For projects exceeding the
MAJCOM’s approval authority, seek approval according to Table 6.1 and Table 6.2. The
installation submits projects with a funded cost of $750,000 and more through the MAJCOM to
AF/A4CF, before advertisement and award.
4.7. Army and Air Force Exchange Service Facilities (AAFES). Unless exempted in this
instruction, AAFES funds all construction and minor construction projects with related
supervision, inspection, and overhead, equipment purchase, and installation. This includes DoD-
approved remote and isolated locations. AAFES Board of Directors provides all authority for
AAFES projects. The AAFES Director/CEO funds projects within amounts delegated by the
Board of Directors. The AAFES Director/CEO in turn delegates approval authority to overseas
region commanders and CONUS region directors.              Projects that exceed the AAFES
Director/CEO's approval authority are presented at an AAFES Board meeting for funding
approval. The AAFES Director/CEO has project approval for all projects with a funded
construction cost of up to $750,000. (T-0) For construction projects with a funded cost from
$200,000 to $750,000, the AAFES Command Engineer must submit a copy of the
approved/signed DD Form 1391 (front and signature pages only) to AF/A4CF. (T-1) The office
of OSD(P&R) will report these projects after the fact in the next annual NAF Construction
Report to the Congress. (T-0) The AAFES command engineer must submit to AF/A4CF the
documentation specified in Attachment 3 for all projects costing over $750,000 for inclusion in
the next annual NAF report to Congress. (T-0) The installation commander or designee must
notify and coordinate with HQ AAFES on all proposed construction that will directly impact
AAFES operated facilities. (T-0)
   4.7.1. Design Services. AAFES funds all design services except the following where
   AAFES may use APFs:
       4.7.1.1. An APF-authorized facility construction project has fallen out of a Fiscal Year
       XX Military Construction Program and the AAFES command engineer later reprograms
       it for construction with NAFs as a waiver to the DoD funding policy. (T-0)
AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                 27


     4.7.1.2. A NAF-authorized facility construction project, according to DoD policy, is
     programmed in a Fiscal Year XX Military Construction Program as a waiver to the DoD
     funding policy. (T-0)
  4.7.2. Design Instruction. Installations will submit the projects in the CE electronic
  programming database and will also enter the DD Forms 1391 into the system. (T-2)
  Installations and AFCEC/CF are required to maintain the CE electronic programming
  database records and shall not advertise or award construction projects or begin design
  efforts until AF/A4CF issues the appropriate design instructions in the CE electronic
  programming database. (T-1) Design instructions issued in the CE electronic database will
  be coordinated with AAFES. (T-1)
  4.7.3. Sustainable Design and Development (SDD) and Energy. All construction,
  renovation and repair projects regardless of scope, fund source or programmed amount shall
  comply with the applicable provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, EO 13423, 42 USC
  § 15801, and EO 13514. (T-0) All new vertical construction and major renovations shall
  fully incorporate the Guiding Principles for Federal leadership in HPSB. (T-0) UFC 1-200-
  02 Change 2, High Performance and Sustainable Building Requirements provides guidance
  regarding HPSB requirements. Additionally, program managers should consider and
  document green alternatives as they develop their specifications and incorporate green
  procurement program language into their contract statements of work.
  4.7.4. Maintenance and Repair Projects. Maintenance and repair work is needed to
  maintain buildings, grounds, and facility systems such as electrical, mechanical, plumbing,
  roofing, foundations, windows, doors, etc. APFs are the appropriate fund source for
  maintenance and repair whether in continental United States (CONUS) or OCONUS. (T-0)
  See Table 3.3 and paragraph 3.11 for additional guidance. AAFES will fund the following
  repair and maintenance exceptions:
     4.7.4.1. Owned by AAFES. Structures to which the AAFES holds title. (T-0)
     4.7.4.2. Occupied by AAFES. Interior finishes of space occupied by the AAFES (e.g.,
     paint, floors, ceilings, special lighting) and of building modifications and alterations
     solely for purposes unique to AAFES operations. (T-0)
     4.7.4.3. On Loan to AAFES. Available Government equipment on loan to the AAFES.
     (T-0)
  4.7.5. Procedures for Submitting AAFES Projects. AAFES develops project
  requirements and initiates projects in coordination with the Installation Commander and Civil
  Engineer Squadron Commander/Base Civil Engineer. For projects requiring DD Forms
  1391, the Civil Engineer Squadron Commander/Base Civil Engineer, Installation
  Commander and MAJCOM Civil Engineer (as applicable) will sign the DD Form 1391
  indicating their proprietary approval of the project. (T-2) AAFES obtains funding approval
  through the AAFES Director/CEO and Board of Directors as appropriate. AAFES projects
  will comply with base and MAJCOM design and architectural standards and siting in
  accordance with the IDP. (T-2)
     4.7.5.1. Projects Within local Installation Commander Approval Authority. The
     AAFES will submit a work request to the Civil Engineer Squadron Commander/Base
     Civil Engineer when projects are within the limits delegated by USAF. (T-1) The Civil
 28                                                         AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014


       Engineer Squadron Commander/Base Civil Engineer processes the work request as
       required for approval or disapproval. If approved, the AAFES may proceed with the
       work using in-house or contract personnel without processing a DD Form 1391.
       4.7.5.2. Projects Over Installation Approval Authority. HQ AAFES provides draft
       DD Forms 1391 and 1391c to the installation for completion and the addition of base
       unique requirements, and signature.   The installation forwards the documents for
       MAJCOM Civil Engineer signature. The MAJCOM forwards the completed package
       back to HQ AAFES. (T-0)
4.8. Private Funding Programming. For purposes of documenting DD Forms 1391, include
projects proposed for financing with private funds in the NAF category; for example: banks,
credit unions, and so forth, which are not NAF instrumentalities (AFI 34-223, Private
Organizations (PO) Program). Do not include private capital projects for contractors
performing Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation or industrial contracts in the NAF
category (AFI 63-609, Managing Industrial Facilities). Do not use APFs or Services NAFs for
constructing, relocating, repairing, or maintaining facilities for private organizations unless
specifically authorized in policy or law. Use AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use of Air
Force Real Property and AFI 65-106 as primary references for guidance on Government support
to private organizations. Facilities constructed with private funds generally require three
approvals prior to contract award. Contact AF/A4CI to determine if a beddown approval is
required. If the facility is to be donated to the Air Force, AFCEC/CIT is responsible for
processing the formal gift acceptance package. Details on the gift acceptance process can be
found in AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force. Construction projects over
$750,000 require OSD(P&R) approval and Congressional notification. MAJCOMs submit
project documents to AF/A4CF to process through SAF/IEE to OSD(P&R) for project approval.
(T-0)
   4.8.1. Project Approval for Private Capital Funded Projects. The installation submits
   through the MAJCOM to AF/A4CF, private capital funded projects with funded costs
   $750,000 and greater but does not include operational or non-community support facilities
   such as administrative facilities. (T-1) Operational or non-community support facility gifts of
   construction greater than $750,000 must still be processed through AFCEC/CIT as described
   above, but do not require reporting in the annual NAF Construction Report to Congress.
   AF/A4CF obtains approval and reports to Congress through OSD(P&R). (T-0) Private
   organization projects must comply with the same construction project approval levels and
   congressional reporting requirements as all other NAF projects. Forward DD Forms 1391
   and 1391c with a request for out lease to AF/A4CF and AFCEC/CIT concurrently. (T-0)
   Submit these projects and requests for out lease when both are fully developed, to permit
   progress on the out lease. For projects with a funded cost between $200,000 and $750,000,
   the MAJCOM must submit a copy of the approved/signed DD Form 1391 (front and
   signature pages only) to AF/A4CF – at the time of approval. (T-0) Private entrepreneurs
   may initiate design at their own risk. NAF Public Private Venture (PPV) projects fall under
   this paragraph. Governing instructions are AFI 32-1024, Standard Facility Requirements,
   AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property, and AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary use of
   Air Force Real Property. For specific information on establishing the following, see the
   referenced instruction.
AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     29


   4.8.2. Banks and Credit Unions. Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force
   (Environment, Safety and Infrastructure) and Secretary of the Air Force (Financial
   Management) jointly approve the establishment of bank and credit union operations,
   regardless of cost. The installation must submit both the project and request for out lease
   simultaneously through the MAJCOM to Secretary of the Air Force (Financial Management)
   and AFCEC. (T-1) The construction project approval levels and congressional reporting
   requirements that apply to all other NAF projects also apply to banks and credit unions (See
   Table 6.1.). Maintenance and Repair of Banks and Credit Unions are funded in accordance
   with the lease agreement for the facility. For projects with a funded cost between $200,000
   and $750,000, the MAJCOM must submit a copy of the approved/signed DD Form 1391
   (front and signature pages only) to AF/A4CF – at the time of approval. For additional
   guidance see DoD 7000.14 R, Vol. 5, Chap. 34, Financial Management Regulation (FMR),
   Procedures Governing Banks, Credit Unions, and Other Financial Institutions on DoD
   Installations.
       4.8.2.1. The MAJCOM commander, or designee, may approve projects with funded
       costs less than $750,000 provided:
           4.8.2.1.1. The bank or credit union already is authorized to operate an office on the
           installation.
           4.8.2.1.2. The proposed lease or lease extension plus any previous lease held by the
           institution does not exceed 25 years.
           4.8.2.1.3. The building space is confined to the needs of the bank or credit union, and
           does not provide space for other commercial or government activities.
           4.8.2.1.4. The building does not exceed authorized space criteria in AFI 32-1024.
4.9. Offer of Gifts for Real Property. When a gift of real property involves construction on
Air Force land or any modification, alteration or addition to Air Force structures, which will
result in additions to the Air Force real property inventory, the real property office will process
the proposed gift to AFCEC/CIT in accordance with AFI 51-601, paragraphs. 1.13 and 3.15, and
AFI 32-9001. (T-1) All other construction project approval levels and reporting requirements
that apply to other NAF projects also apply to offers of gifts. For any offer of gift that involves
real property construction work, obtain proper project approval (Table 6.1). If the funded
project cost is over $750,000, the installation must concurrently submit through the MAJCOM to
AFCEC/CIT and AF/A4CF, the DD Forms 1391 and 1391c and offer of gift package for
acceptance of the gift, appropriate approval, and subsequent reporting to the Congress. (T-0)
Congressional reporting in accordance with DoDI 7700.18 applies to facilities such as museums,
education centers, etc. but does not include operational or non-community support facilities such
as administrative facilities and Fisher House. Operational or non-community support facility
gifts of construction greater than $750,000 must still be processed through AFCEC as described
above, but do not require reporting in the annual NAF Construction Report to Congress. Make
sure the total amount of funds required for the construction project is available before submission
of the package. See the AFI 32-9001, AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures, and
AFI 51-601 for specific guidance.
   4.9.1. Museum Construction. For funding guidance of museum facilities see AFI 65-601
   Vol.1, section 4J and see Chapter 6 of this document for the approval process.
 30                                                         AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014


   4.9.2. Gift Enhancements. In lieu of a complete donor-funded facility being constructed,
   appropriated funded projects can be enhanced with donor funds to provide additional real
   property requirements (e.g. architectural features, landscaping, etc.).
       4.9.2.1. Enhancements may be donated in conjunction with an appropriated funded
       project. (T-1)
       4.9.2.2. Enhancements should be identified as early in planning/programming as possible
       and should be appropriately specified in the donor's proffer. (T-1)
       4.9.2.3. A separate DD Form 1391 will be developed for all gifts. (T-1)
       4.9.2.4. Enhancements should be bid as separately-funded options in conjunction with
       the appropriated funded project or as a separate contract after the appropriated funded
       project is complete. (T-1)
       4.9.2.5. The appropriated fund project must have a basic bid package that provides a
       "complete & useable" facility without the optional bid enhancements. (T-1)

                                            Chapter 5

              TYPES OF LABOR FOR USE ON COMMUNITY FACILITIES

5.1. Military and Appropriated Fund Civilian Labor. Table 5.1 contains labor guidance for
construction, repair, and maintenance of community facilities (Categories A, B, C, and Lodging
Fund Facilities). The "X" on the chart indicates that the facility category is authorized use of that
particular labor. MAJCOMs should contact AF/A4CF for clarification.
5.2. Civil Engineer Military and Appropriated Fund Civilian Labor. Use this labor on
mission sustaining activities and Category A facilities and for maintaining and repairing all
facilities, including NAF facilities (except for golf course grounds maintenance). If the
workforce is available, use it for authorized NAF facilities. When using civil engineer labor on
authorized Category C NAF facilities, the NAF instrumentality custodian must reimburse the
civil engineer at labor rates (shop rates) with NAFs except as noted in paragraph 5.4 (T-1) See
Table 5.1 Do not use civil engineer labor on NAF facilities to the extent that the workload
requires work on other facilities be contracted out.
5.3. Civil Engineer Military Training Labor. Do not use military training exercises
performed by Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineer (RED
HORSE), Base Engineer Emergency Forces (BEEF), AFRC, ANG, and other military personnel,
to construct, maintain, or repair projects on facilities for which NAFs are the funding source for
minor or major construction. Military training labor may not be used to construct privately
funded projects including banks and museums. This guidance also applies to remote and isolated
locations. Military members participating in extended training periods may donate labor at
services facilities while off duty during the training period. See Table 5.1 (T-1)
5.4. Donated Labor. Military or APF civilian personnel can volunteer or donate their labor at
Force Support facilities after their normal duty hours. Members of any military service can
donate their labor. Only individuals in an official leave status can donate their time during the
normal duty day. To avoid violation of Title 31 USC § 1341, Anti-Deficiency Act individuals
offering to provide voluntary services must first agree in writing that the services are truly
voluntary and that they expect no compensation nor will they make any claim for compensation.
(T-0)
5.5. Self-Help Labor. Military or APF civilian personnel can donate their labor at Force
Support facilities at the installation where employed. They cannot receive additional pay or
compensatory time. They can perform this self-help during their normal duty hours. To avoid
violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act, individuals offering to provide voluntary services must first
agree in writing that the services are truly voluntary and they expect no compensation nor will
they claim for compensation. (T-0) See AFMAN 34-214, Procedures for Nonappropriated
Fund Financial Management and Accounting, for instructions on the use of NAF self-help labor.
5.6. Prison Labor. Federal/state prisoners or incarcerated military personnel perform this labor.
Use prison labor primarily for the upkeep of common grounds and for limited construction,
maintenance, and repair work, as stated in Table 5.1. Military prisoners do not receive
additional pay. Only federal/state prisoners can work on golf courses and then only if no other
installation grounds upkeep activities can use their labor. Use NAFs for any expenses incurred
AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                      33


when the installation pays federal/state prisoners for work on golf courses. Do not use prison
labor for any type of work at or around child development or youth facilities. (T-0)

  NOTES:
  1. This table is applicable to those facilities that have NAF or private funds as the fund source for
  construction. MAJCOM Commander may delegate to the installations only approval authority within criteria
  for projects below $200K.
  2. AF/A4C may re-delegate approval authority within criteria for projects $200K-$750K to the
  MAJCOM/DRU/A7, but not below. Also the MAJCOM only has "proprietary" approval of AAFES projects.
  3. At the time of approval, MAJCOM must submit a copy of the approved/signed DD Form 1391 (front and
  signature pages only) for projects $200-750K to AF/A4CF and AF/A1SF. SAF/IEE will continue to report
  these after-the-fact in the annual NAF Construction Report to Congress. (T-0)
  4. These projects require after-the-fact congressional notification.
  5. Installations may request consideration for authority to advertise once OSD(P&R) submits to Congress.
  AF/A4CF validates the current working estimate, and AFPC/SV certifies funds are available for Services projects.
  6. These require congressional notification and release in the Annual NAF Construction Report to Congress
  before award.
  7. OSD(P&R) approves most waivers to fund source. Waivers and exceptions of projects exceeding $750K
  must still be reported to Congress. If a criteria does not exist or does not specifically address the facility an
  “exception” is required. “Waivers” are obtained for existing and applicable criteria that the programmer is
  requesting an exemption from. (T-0)
  8. Example: SAF/IEE can approve the mix for an APF Military Clothing Sales Store within an AAFES
  (NAF) Base Exchange facility or approve NAF funding for excessive APF utilities and roads from the
  base system to the site boundary or nearest manhole, whichever is closest to the facility under
  construction. Excessive is defined as exceeding 15% of the NAF project cost or $750,000, whichever
  is less.
  9. These projects use private funds, not APFs or Services NAFs.
6.2. Maintenance and Repair Project Approval Levels. Table 6.2 details the approval level
for maintenance and repair projects on facilities where NAFs are specified fund source for
construction. This table applies to project approval (not to be confused with funding approval)
for those facilities that have NAF as the fund source for construction.

 NOTES:
 1. MAJCOM/CC can delegate his or her approval authority up to $1,000K to the installation commander or his or
 her designee.
 2. For repair of Category C items required to support activity operations: MAJCOM/DRU/A7 can delegate
 approval level to the installation commander, but it cannot be re-delegated below the SV or CE commanders.
 3. MAJCOM/DRU/A7, or his or her designee, can combine a $2,500K NAF repair project with a $1,000K
 APF repair project for a total effort of $3,500K in a single facility.
 4. AAFES has up to $500K repair authority using NAFs.
 5. At the time of approval, MAJCOM must provide AF/A4CF a copy of the DD Form 1391 (front page
 only) for any approved APF repair project costing greater than $1M.
 6. The $5,000K AF/A4C approval level includes NAF, APF or any combination of both.
   6.2.1. Approval Authority for Repair Cost Increases. Approval authority for cost
   increases to repair projects lies with different organizations based upon the type of funding
   and the amount of the increase. Reference AFI 34-205 for specific guidance on approval
   levels. The total repair cost shouldn’t exceed 75% of the replacement cost (see paragraph
   3.10 for more information). MAJCOMs must provide a courtesy copy of the approval
   document to AF/A4CF. (T-1)
6.3. Advertisement and Award. NAF construction projects over $750K require AF/A4CF
authorization prior to both advertisement and award. (T-1)
   6.3.1. Advertisement Authority. AF/A4CF authorization is required before installations
   may advertise a construction project. (T-1)
        6.3.1.1. Advanced Advertisement. AF/A4CF will consider advanced advertising
        authority once OSD(P&R) forwards the annual Nonappropriated Fund Construction
        Report to the Congress -- provided the cost remains valid and AFPC/SV certifies funds
        are available. AF/A4CF will consider advanced advertising authority for projects within
        AF/A4C and Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Environment, Safety and
        Infrastructure) authority on a case-by-case basis.
   6.3.2. Statement of Work. For Services centrally funded construction and A-E design
   projects costing $200,000 and greater, installations must submit copies of the statement of
   work to AFPC/SVXF. (T-2) Installations must obtain AFPC/SVXF coordination prior to
   advertisement of any (design and/or construction) centrally funded NAF project. (T-2) In
   addition, AF/A4CF design instruction is required prior to advertisement. (T-1)
   6.3.3. Contract Award. Do not award a construction contract until both project (AF/A4C)
   and funding (AF/A1S) approvals are received. For AF Services projects, execution agents
   must obtain certification of funding availability from AFPC/SV prior to advertisement or
   award.

                  CONGRESSIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

7.1. Requirements and Conditions on Projects Reported to the Congress. The annual NAF
report includes major construction projects planned for award within the next fiscal year.
OSD(P&R) forwards the report to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees. Make
sure the projects are at least 35 percent (design-build can be 15 percent) designed before
submitting them to AF/A4CF, for inclusion in the report. For AF Cetrally funded NAF projects,
designs must be at 65 percent or more for design, bid, build projects. Funds must be available
for construction to meet the award schedules. Submit proposed design, advertising, and award
schedules for each project reported.
7.2. Submittal Process. Installation and MAJCOM staffs must obtain OSD(P&R) approval for
projects costing over $750,000. The installation initiates the projects and submits its annual
program to the MAJCOM, which forwards the MAJCOM program to AF/A4CF, for submittal to
Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Environment, Safety and Infrastructure), the
OSD(P&R), and the Congress. (T-0) AAFES projects are submitted directly to AF/A4CF.
Follow guidance from AF/A4CF for the annual report.
7.3. Report Contents. The NAF Report to Congress content is prescribed by DoDI 7700.18.

     source. (T-0) AAFES/RE and AFPC/SVXF are responsible for submitting summaries for
     their respective programs to AF/A4CF for consolidation. (T-0)
  7.3.3. Minor Construction Projects. MAJCOMs shall submit a list of NAF construction
  projects with costs between $200,000 and $750,000 that have been approved since the last
  Report to Congress. (T-0) Specify the state/country, installation, project title, total
  investment cost, construction cost, design cost, collateral equipment cost, scope, estimated
  contract award date, and the funding source (NAF, surcharge, or private funds) using the
  format in Enclosure 6 of DoDI 7700.18. (T-0)
  7.3.4. Status of Previously Approved Projects. AFPC/SVXF and AAFES/RE shall submit
  a status report of all previously approved major projects to AF/A4CF. (T-1) Specify the
  fiscal year approved, state/country, installation, project title, programmed amount and total
  investment cost. For projects still under design, report the percent complete and estimated
  award date. For projects in construction, report the percent complete and estimated
  construction complete date. Projects that have been cancelled; projects not awarded within 1
  fiscal year following the approved program year; and projects that have experienced
  cost/scope changes are addressed in the following paragraphs.
     7.3.4.1. Cancelled Projects. Congressional notification is required for projects
     cancelled that had funded costs over $750,000. When it is necessary to cancel a project of
     Services, AAFES, or private organizations, the appropriate agency must immediately
     inform AF/A4C. (T-0) List the previously approved project, specify the fiscal year
     approved, state or country, installation, project title, and total investment cost. Also
     provide a summary paragraph describing the rationale for canceling the project. Notify
     AFPC/SV on all centrally funded project cancellations. AF/A4CF will then cancel the
     Design Instruction in the CE electronic programming database. (T-1)
     7.3.4.2. Delayed Contract Awards. Congress emphasizes timely program execution;
     awards for projects over $750,000 are achieved through aggressive and prudent project
     management. Authority to award expires no later than the end of the fiscal year in which
     the project was reported to the Congress. Funding approval for AFBCIF and AFLF
     projects expires the same time as project approval. See AFI 34-205, para 7.8 for
     information on obtaining extensions to project funding approval. AF/A4CF, in
     coordination with AFPC/SVXF, must approve extensions for projects not awarded by
     that date. AF/A4CF will consider any extension of not more than 1 year after the
     reported year to accommodate unforeseen site problems, Architect-Engineer design
     delays, compliance with host-nation agreements, year-end procurement difficulties, etc.
     (T-1) AFCEC will forward an extension request to the AF/A4CF providing an
     explanation of the delay and a revised award schedule. (T-1) The notification will
     include a courtesy copy to AFPC/SVXF, the Installation Commander, and Base Civil
AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                 39


     Engineer. Include the fiscal year approved, state or country, installation, project title,
     Service, total investment cost and estimated contract award date and a paragraph
     describing the rationale for the delay (see Attachment 6). A revised DD Form 1391
     shall be provided for each project. (T-1) Projects not awarded by 1 Apr of the extension
     year will be submitted through the MAJCOM/A4P Programs Division Chief to AF/A4CF
     for inclusion in the annual NAF report to the Congress. (T-1) Funding approval for
     AFBCIF and AFLF projects expires the same time as project approval. See AFI 34-205,
     para 7.8 for information on obtaining extensions to project funding approval. Continue
     efforts to award the project. If award is accomplished by 1 Aug notify AF/A4CF and the
     project will be removed from the Awarded Within Two Years Section of the Report to
     Congress. (T-1) For AAFES projects, re-reporting will be accomplished thru AAFES to
     AF/A4CF as part of the annual report to Congress. (T-1)
     7.3.4.3. Services Projects—Scope, Cost or Concept Changes. Any changes to the
     scope, cost, or concept of a centrally funded Services NAF project require approval by
     the AFPC/SV staff, the NAF Facilities Panel, or the Air Staff. Additionally, projects with
     cost increases exceeding 25 percent or scope changes exceeding 10 percent (either
     increase or decrease) require re-reporting the project to OSD(P&R) and Congress. The
     installation Mission Support Group Commander submits a request to approve changes,
     with supporting documentation, through the MAJCOM (for M&R projects and
     construction projects up to $750,000), and through AFCEC/CF (for projects over
     $750,000) to AFPC/SV for action. Provide an information copy of the request to
     AF/A4CFC. (T-1) If a project previously estimated to cost $750,000 or below (funded
     cost) exceeds the $750,000 ceiling, then it must be approved by OSD(P&R) and reported
     to Congress as part of the annual report to Congress before it can be placed under
     contract. (T-0) If contractor claims create a requirement to seek higher headquarters
     approval for a cost increase, request guidance from AF/A4CF. Scope increases that
     exceed the space criteria in AFMAN 32-1084, an AF/A4C approved design guide, or an
     approved PVA, must also be approved by SAF/IEE or AF/A1S. (T-1) Project
     documentation required for project and funding approval are also required for changes
     (See Attachment 3). (T-1) Further guidance on Services requirements may be found in
     AFI 34-205.
     7.3.4.4. Exchange Projects - Scope and Cost Changes. Scope increases or decreases
     beyond specific thresholds require congressional re-notification. (T-0) For projects
     approved by Congress (over $750,000), HQ AAFES may approve scope increases and
     decreases to 10 percent of the approved scope. They may also approve cost increases up
     to 25 percent over the approved funded amount, provided they do not exceed any other
     approval thresholds. Scope variations (increase or decrease) beyond 10 percent and cost
     increases beyond 25 percent require congressional re-notification. (T-0) Submit requests
     with revised DD Forms 1391/1391c to AF/A4CF for processing.
     7.3.4.5. All Other Nonappropriated Fund Projects - Scope and Cost
     Variations. Apply the same guidance as for Exchange projects. However, the NAF
     instrumentality providing or authorizing project funds must approve funding for all
     increases. (T-1)

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR CATEGORY C FUNCTIONALLY UNIQUE ITEMS TO
                 SUPPORT ACTIVITY OPERATIONS

Nonappropriated funds will pay for the maintenance and repair of functionally unique items
required to support Category C program operations. Functionally unique items make the
facility usable for the activity it contains, but are not considered part of the normal facility
system. For guidance on Appropriated Funds, see Chapter 3. Paragraphs A2.1, A2.2, and
A2.3 contain a representative listing of functionally unique items for your use. Bases should
establish a MOA with NAF activities to define the expected level of service the base would
provide with APFs. Contact AF/A4CF if a particular work requirement requires clarification.
A2.1. Building Interior
   A2.1.1. Rearrangement or removal of non load-bearing walls.
   A2.1.2. Bowling lanes (Bowling Centers with more than 16 lanes).
   A2.1.3. Unique systems for security, alarm, health and safety specific to the activity and in
   excess of Base Standards.
   A2.1.4. Bowling pin-setting equipment.

   similar wall coverings used in other buildings on base that are authorized APF support.
   A2.1.7. Ornate bathroom fixtures. This does not include specialized fixtures such as sensor
   controlled water spigots, flush valves, etc. that are intended to support environmental, utility
   conservation, or green building initiatives.
   A2.1.8. NAF revenue producing functions such as lounges, eating areas, kitchens, etc.,
   including, range hoods and ducts (not to include grease traps inside or outside the facility).
   Ornate or unusual entry doors that exceed the base standard found on other APF supported
   facilities. See AFI 65-106 for additional guidance.
   A2.1.9. Golf clubhouse locker rooms, lounges, snack bars, kitchens.
   A2.1.10. Equipment that is a direct function of the activity, i.e., dishwashers, ice machines,
   liquor systems, walk-in coolers, gas station dispensers, car wash equipment, etc.
   A2.1.11. Auxiliary power supply, e.g. generators, tanks, inside or outside the building that
   are not required by base standards or to meet safety, fire protection, AT, etc.
   A2.1.12. Specialized pest control services that are not part of installation-wide pest control,
   may be provided to MWR on a reimbursable basis. Category C facilities are funded by NAF
   (see AFI 65-106, APF Authorized Support Table).

 DOCUMENTS REQUIRED FOR PROJECT APPROVAL AND FUNDING SUPPORT

A3.1. Required Documentation. The amount and complexity of the required documentation
are dependent on the required approval level for the project.
   A3.1.1. Within Installation Commander's Approval Authority. Nonappropriated funded
   projects within the installation commander's approval authority typically requires an AF
   Form 332 or DD Form 1391, PVA for Services projects (as determined by AFPC/SV), an
   Installation Commander's Certificate (format provided at end of this attachment), and 75
   percent calculation if applicable.
   A3.1.2. Within MAJCOM Approval Authority. These projects require a DD Form 1391,
   single line drawings, site plan, detailed cost estimate, existing facility/deficiency detail data
   sheets using DD Form 1391c, PVA for Services projects (as determined by AFPC/SV),
   Installation Commander's Certificate (format provided at end of this attachment), 75 percent

                               PREPARING DD FORMS 1391

A5.1. Preparing the 1391. Use the following directions to prepare DD Forms 1391 for all
projects funded from NAF. Since the DD Form 1391 is the basis on which individual projects
and some Air Force-wide programs are justified and approved, they must be carefully prepared
to provide complete, accurate, and essential information. The project documents must provide a
complete word picture of the work planned and the reason for the work. For phased work, a clear
description of the ultimate goal of the phased program should be included. The appropriate
authority must approve project documents on the front sheet DD Form 1391 or DD Form 1391c
for each facility project. (T-3)
 All of the 1391s and 1391c s should be entered into the CE electronic programming database.

 BLOCK 1-Component: Enter "AIR FORCE", which is a mandatory entry.
    Title Block: Enter the fiscal year of the funds paying for the project.
  FY MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT DATA
 BLOCK 2-Date: The date block should be left blank.

 BLOCK 3-Installation and Location: Put the name of the installation and the state or country
 where it’s located. Also, enter the name of the installation where work will be done if it is an
 off-base site. The type of the base should be stated as Air Force Base, Air Base, Air National
 Guard, or Air Reserve Base after the name.

 BLOCK 4-Project Title: First word will be "Maintain", "Repair", “Construct”,
 “Renovate”, “Consolidate”, “Demolish”, or “Add.” Make it clear what the work is
 to do. Include all work classifications associated with each project. Be sure to use the name
 of the facility in the title not just the facility number (i.e. Add to and Repair Bowling
 Center, Bldg 1).

 BLOCK 5-Program Element: Use NAF for Nonappropriated funds, PVT for private
 organizations or AAFES for Army and Air Force Exchange Service.

 BLOCK 6-Category Code: Show the six-digit code for the real property facilities. References:
 Categories described in Chapter 3, Automated Air Force Pricing Guide, AFCEC Category Code
 Listing, AF Corporate Data Dictionary available through Defense Data Network.

 BLOCK 7-Project Number: This number is locally assigned and should be consistent with the
 CE electronic programming database module.
56                                                          AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014



BLOCK 8-Project Cost: While NAF does not have element of expense investment codes
(EEICs), you can still use the codes to identify the classification of work. Show the EEIC or
work class and total funded project cost, for example EEIC 529 - $000K, or minor
construction - $000K.

This value must be same as Total Request (Rounded) on Block 9. (T-0)

Maintenance/Repair and Minor Construction projects should be identified separately.
Project documentation should clearly specify project cost for each EEIC being used to fund the
proposed work.

BLOCK 9-Cost Estimates: This section provides for a breakout of costs by identifiable
elements of work including design, construction, collateral equipment, antiterrorism/force
protection, restoration, modernization, companion projects, appropriated fund supporting
projects and other associated costs, regardless the funding source. Refer to Attachment 1, AFI
65-601, Volume 1 and AFI 32-1032, A2.11 for a detailed breakout of funded versus
unfunded costs. Show Overhead and Profit (OH&P) expenses here as funded costs (when
appropriate), however, do not show a line item with a zero cost. Use local experience for
amount. Show Supervision, Inspection, and Overhead (SIOH) and Furniture, Fixtures and
Equipment (FF&E) as applicable.

Primary facility, which is the first item, should match the Project Title (Block 4). For projects
like visiting quarters include the number of personnel to be housed in parenthesis.

Sustainable Design and Development (SDD) and Energy. SDD and energy costs should be
included as a separate line item under Primary Facility. Document Sustainable Development
Policy, EPAct05, EO13423 and EISA07 costs. (T-0) These costs will be programmed at no
more than 2% of the total construction cost unless specific detailed costs are determined.
When the costs exceed 2% an explanation will be provided in block 10. Energy costs will be
supported by a Building Life Cycle Cost (BLCC) analysis using the BLCC software
developed by the Department of Energy and results of the analysis will be entered in CE
electronic programming database. (T-0)

Antiterrorism should be included as a separate line item under ―Primary Facility.
AT costs in excess of 3% of the primary facility cost need to be justified in Block 11. See UFC
04-010-01 for specific AT guidance.

For CONUS projects, AT should be 0.5-1.0% of Primary Facility.
For OVERSEAS projects AT should be 0.5-3.0% of Primary Facility.
AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                       57


Supporting Facilities Supporting Facilities cost in excess of 20% of the Primary Facility cost
need to be justified in Block 11. Supporting Facilities include only the following: Utilities,
Site Improvement, Pavements and Communications.

Subtotal is the sum of primary and secondary facility costs.
Contingency is normally 5% of the Subtotal. Rates in excess of 5% should be justified in
Block11.

Total contract cost is the sum of the Subtotal and Contingency.

Supervision, Inspection and Overhead (SIOH) fee is charged by the design/construction
agent/manager. This is calculated as a certain percentage of the Total Contract Cost.

      CONUS projects via US Army Corps of Engineers or Navy is 5.7%

      USAFE projects located in the United Kingdom is 5%

      USAFE projects other than United Kingdom is 6.5%

      Overseas projects via US Army or US Navy is also 6.5%

Ensure there are no mathematical errors in the cost estimate. Design costs are unfunded.
Ensure cost estimate uses current inflation indices to bring appropriate project costs into the
year of expected execution (especially for phased work). Provide a separate cost estimate
for companion maintenance, repair, minor construction projects, unfunded design costs, and
unfunded Furniture, Fixture and Equipment (FF&E). Include demolition costs if
appropriate and applicable.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate: Enter the rate used, when applicable.

Total PA Request (Rounded): Round project cost (the PA not Total NAF investment) to
the nearest thousand.

      Rounding Rules:

      Project Cost        Round To Nearest
      Less than $1M          $10,000
      $1M to $5M             $50,000
      $5M to $10M            $100,000
      $10M to $20M           $200,000
      Over $20M              $1,000,000

BLOCK 10-Description of Proposed Work: Describe the major work planned by work
classification. When a NAF project has a companion APF project, ensure each project
references the other related project. NAF minor construction work should be on a separate
project number; however, ensure that each project’s programming document(s) reference other
 58                                                           AFI32-1022 13 NOVEMBER 2014


related projects. For phased work, describe the work included in each phase. Be succinct, but
descriptive. Units of measure shall be expressed in metric units.

BLOCK 11-Requirement: The REQUIREMENT is the total size (SM, LS, UN, EA, etc)
necessary to fulfill the mission. ADEQUATE represents an existing facility or portion of that
can be used to meet the REQUIREMENT. SUBSTANDARD represents the facility or
facilities that cannot be used (and will normally be demolished).

Requirement: Tell what the project will provide, including the ultimate goal for a phased
project. Be specific and ensure the description of the requirement coincides with the
classification of work. Avoid use of verbs or other language, which would indicate another
work classification. For example, install and replace may give the idea that work is new (e.g.
construction) whereas upgrade would likely indicate repair class work.

The current situation: Include age of the facility or associated components; general
conditions of the items requiring work; energy conservation or environmental
considerations; current impact to installation mission; etc.

Impact if the project is not provided: Include any information, which helps form a word
picture of why this project is necessary, state if this project is economically feasible, and the
impacts if not accomplished.

Additional: Includes any additional information such as related AFIs or AFMs supporting
this kind of facility at this location, and state if this project is economically feasible
according to the PVA.

This section should include estimated date for the design start, the estimated percent of the
design to be completed as of July 1, date the design to be 100% completed, date construction
contracts to be awarded, and date the construction is to be completed.
A5.2. Preparing the DD Form 1391c. DD Form 1391c of a project covers all the additional
necessary documents.
   A5.2.1. Detailed Deficiency Data Sheet. Includes scope of project FY_request, mission,
   requirements, and functional breakout of proposed project scope.
   A5.2.2. Detailed Cost Estimate. Includes the costs of: preparation and development,
   structures, site work, real property installed equipment (RPIE), and fees like Design and
   Environmental.
   A5.2.3. Companion and Associated Projects. if any.
   A5.2.4. Financial Analysis. A Financial analysis shall be accomplished in accordance with
   AFI 65-501.
      On a DD Form 1391c page provide a summary of the financial analysis. (T-0)

     the project updates, replaces, or creates a new program or service. Describe the specific
     location and the major reasons for selecting the location, the adjacent community-type
     facilities (including projects that are planned or under design/construction), public
     interest in the project, a summary of a local business reaction to Category C projects, and
     the military installations in the commuting area with a similar facility.
     A5.2.4.2. Prospective Customers. Identify the prospective patron base by group
     (military members and their families, retirees and their families, Defense civilians, etc),
     expected number of customers, the proximity of the customer base, and the PVA method
     used to validate the patron base and market demand.
     A5.2.4.3. Alternatives and Identification of Waiver Requests. Describe the
     alternative methods of providing the service that were considered and the rationale for
     discarding them. Identify alternative funding sources and the rationale for the selected
     source of funding. Should the proposed funding deviate from the DoD prescribed source,
     supporting rationale for a policy waiver shall be provided.
     A5.2.4.4. PPV Assessment. Submit documentation of the PPV assessment which
     should be contained in the PVA. (T-3)
     A5.2.4.5. PVA. An executive summary of the PVA shall be provided and include the
     following:
             A market analysis of availability of similar services from the public and
             private sector. A facility analysis of the structure, design, and functional
             characteristics of the existing and proposed facility.

             An analysis of expected utilization. Recommendations for construction
             alternatives. (T-0)
     A5.2.4.6. Design Data. Justification must be furnished for projects that have not
     reached the minimum required design stage. (T-2)
     A5.2.4.7. Investment Calculations. Furnish the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate
     of Return (IRR), and Payback calculations. Calculations for NPV and IRR shall be based
     on the same estimated useful life. (T-3) Cash inflows and outflows should be shown in a
     level of detail that shall allow replication of the calculations. Identify whether the
     analysis is based on total cash flows or the incremental cash flow attributable to the
     project and the rationale for the method utilized. Contact HQ AFPC/SVXF for additional
     information on Financial Analysis requirements for AF NAF Projects.
     A5.2.4.8. Payback Calculations. For payback calculations, the recovery period must
     occur within the project’s estimated useful life.
     A5.2.4.9. Qualitative Analysis. In the event an individual project does not meet the
     hurdle rate defined by the DoD Component, an executive summary of the qualitative
     analysis shall be included. (T-0) Alternatives utilized in justifying the project may
     include market research, customer survey data, facility deficiency data, and mission or
     quality of life considerations.
