                          ANSWERING HIGH LEVEL INQUIRIES

A2.1. High-level inquiries are normally from Congress, but also include the Department of
Defense and the President.
   A2.1.1. The governing directive is AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations with Congress.
   A2.1.2. This instruction directs the procedures for handling inquiries locally.
A2.2. The inquiry is routed through AFPC/DSXI directly to the 39 ABW/IG office with the
following exceptions:
   A2.2.1. AF/SG routes inquiries concerning quality of medical care directly to the 39th
   Medical Group (39 MDG).
   A2.2.2. AFLOA/JAJM routes inquiries regarding legal actions directly to 39th Air Base
   Wing Judge Advocate (39 ABW/JA).
   A2.2.3. SAF/AQCX routes inquiries about contracting issues directly to 39th Contracting
   Squadron (39 CONS).
   A2.2.4. AFPC/DSXI routes inquiries about personnel matters directly to the 39 FSS.
   A2.2.5. If the matter is deemed an IG issue (e.g., allegations of reprisal, restriction, etc), then
   SAF/LLI takes the matter to SAF/IGQ, and it flows through USAFE/IGQ to 39 ABW/IG for
   determining whether an investigation is warranted.
A2.3. Responses go back to the tasking agency after being coordinated with the group
commander/wing vice commander, SJA and IG and are approved for release by the wing
commander.
   A2.3.1. Send copies to USAFE/IGQ.
A2.4. Rules of engagement.
   A2.4.1. Normal suspense from time of our receipt is 48 hours, which includes time for legal,
   IG and command section coordination. This gives the unit a day to answer and coordinate
   through the group commander. Extensions must be requested through the 39 ABW/IG as
   soon as it is determined the unit needs additional time.
   A2.4.2. READ the inquiry and determine what primary issues needs to be addressed or
   answered. A recommended technique you can use is to make a copy of the letter and
   highlight specific issues as you read through the inquiry. Often the root issues are buried in
   an emotional or wordy letter.
   A2.4.3. Respond to the issues in the following matter:
      A2.4.3.1. The first paragraph should indicate whom the response is to, the complainant’s
      name and the general nature of the complaint.
      A2.4.3.2. The second paragraph should be a brief background. Remember the person
      reading the response doesn’t have your knowledge of the person or the situation.

        A2.4.3.3. The remaining paragraphs should clearly outline the issues as presented in the
        inquiry and present a direct, succinct answer.
     A2.4.4. Depending on the complexity of the issue, an e-SSS might be required; use your
     judgment. If required, use the format in Attachment 4. Include any background information
     in the tabs but understand the only thing sent out is the double spaced draft response.
     A2.4.5. Be sure to obtain the complainant’s approval to release the information to the
     inquirer, which may include their parents. Even if the individual appeared to be the author of
     the letter, in order to protect the information, a third party release will be required. If the
     individual will not consent, a response will be drafted and the tasking agency will be notified
     to not release the information.
     A2.4.6. The 39ABW/IG will coordinate with the responding agency before making
     substantial changes. REMEMBER: Keep a copy of the package for reference. This will
     keep from having to recreate the entire package, in the event it gets lost or misplaced.
     A2.4.7. Coordinate through the squadron and group commanders and then take the response
     to the legal office for their review. Call 39 ABW/IG to let them know legal has the package
     so it can be tracked.
     A2.4.8. You may receive the package directly from the command section for a rewrite.
     Contact 39 ABW/IG when this happens so they can track the progress of the package.
     Return the corrected package to 39 ABW/IG for final review. Include the initial draft with
     any edits with the corrected package. NOTE: Be sure to update the letter and Staff
     Summary Sheet with any additional information you may have received since the original
     package was drafted.
A2.5. Final words of wisdom.
     A2.5.1. If you receive a high-level inquiry, contact 39 ABW/IG and email or fax a copy to
     their office as soon as possible. The 39 ABW/IG may have additional information and needs
     to know there is an inquiry on base.
     A2.5.2. The answer going out of the 39 ABW will be coordinated through both JA and IG.
     In all cases, the release authority will be the wing commander.
     A2.5.3. Responses to high-level inquiries are not usually too difficult to answer but they are
     time constrained, so work them hard and the 39 ABW/IG will work to get them off base as
     soon as possible.

I, (Name, Rank, Last 4 of SSN or DoD ID Number), do/do not hereby authorize release of
information to (name of the individual(s) that information will be released), e.g.,
Congressperson, parents, others requesting information pertaining to specify subject of the
inquiry, e.g., separation, discipline, medical treatment, etc. If the individual would like to put
limits on what is released, they may do so.

NOTES:
1. Third party release is required even if the individual wrote the letter to the Congressperson,
etc. to ensure they know 39 ABW/IG is responding to their correspondence and someone is not
using their name. This protects us from releasing personal information inadvertently.
2. The witness can be anyone in the unit, but preferably an NCO or above, in a supervisory
position.
3. Make sure the individual strikes out one of the two options (do/do not). If the individual does
not want the information released, it will still be sent to the tasking organization but not released
to the Congressperson, etc.
