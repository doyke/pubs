                            SPECIAL CLIMATIC CONDITIONS

A6.1. Volcanoes. Since 1700, at least 41 volcanoes in Alaska have erupted, some of these as

volcanic explosion.

   A6.2.2. Close doors, windows, and dampers.
   A6.2.3. Listen to your radio.
   A6.2.4. Do not turn on exhaust fans or run clothes dryers.

experiences over 20,000 earthquakes per year.
A6.5. Before an Earthquake:
   A6.5.1. Secure bookcases, file cabinets, pictures, mirrors, and so forth, to walls. Include
   appliances, which could move and rupture gas or electrical lines.
   A6.5.2. Prepare a disaster supply kit.
   A6.5.3. Know basic first aid.
   A6.5.4. Know emergency phone numbers.
A6.6. During an Earthquake:
   A6.6.1. Stay calm! If inside, stay inside. If outside, stay outside.
   A6.6.2. Inside: DROP--COVER--HOLD. Take cover under a heavy desk or against an
   inside wall away from glass and falling objects.
   A6.6.3. Outside: Move to a clear area, away from buildings, signs, utility lines, and trees.
   Sit on the ground and do not attempt to stand.
   A6.6.4. On the road: Drive away from underpasses and overpasses. Stop in a safe area.
   Stay in vehicle.

   car keys, coats, and so forth.
   A6.7.6. Clean up spilled medicines, bleaches, and other hazardous materials.
   A6.7.7. Listen to the radio (KFQD ®, 750 AM) (EAS) for public safety instructions.
   A6.7.8. Do not use the telephone or cellular phone except for an emergency.
   A6.7.9. Plan for at least a 72-120 hour survival situation.
