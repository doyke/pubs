          Wing Honor Chairman, call the HRCEP into session as required to fulfill its
          responsibilities.

          action to the HRC in each case. The HRC will be the final authority on all allegations
          of improper questions.
          4.1.2.3. Review practices within the cadet wing that may be inconsistent with the
          Honor Code.
          4.1.2.4. Develop and review guidelines for use by the cadet wing in determining
          whether a particular “questionable practice” or “gray area” is a violation of the Honor
          Code.
          4.1.2.5. Consider any unusual situation of “conflict of moral obligations” that
          involves a “technical violation” with both act and intent, but where the cadet has
          acted in good faith for a higher moral good and not in contrast with the spirit of the
          Honor Code. In all cases, the HRCEP will recommend appropriate action to the
          HRC, and the HRC will be the final authority for deciding a situation involving a
          “conflict of moral obligation.” The HRCEP will brief all activity at the next meeting
          of the HRC.
          4.1.2.6. If during the review process, both the presiding Group Honor Chairman and
          the Wing Honor Chairman feel the case should be dropped, but USAFA/CWCH feels
          the case should be forwarded, the HRCEP will review the case and be the final
          determinant as to whether or not the case is forwarded or dropped.
5. HRC Meetings. The Superintendent or HRC Chairman may call the HRC into session at any
time. As a minimum, the HRC will meet once during the academic year.
