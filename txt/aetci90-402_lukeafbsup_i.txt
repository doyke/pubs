         regarding a 56 FW issue.
         2.10.3.2. (Added-LUKEAFB) 56 FW/IG will acknowledge receipt of inquiries

       FW/CC, Vice Commander (CV), and Staff Judge Advocate (JA) to determine the
       appropriate OPR. OPRs will comply with the established suspense date (typically
       three working days); if an extension is required, immediately notify the 56 FW/IG for
       assistance. Note: Only the 56 FW/IG will coordinate with tasking agency for a
       change in the suspense date. Suspense date requests will not be approved if request
       date is the actual suspense date.
       2.10.3.5. (Added-LUKEAFB) Congressional inquiries are sensitive issues; the
       privacy and rights of affected individuals must be protected at all times. Written

    directly from a member of Congress. (The commander may designate another senior
    officer within the command to sign final response letters.) Provide a courtesy copy of the
    final response to HQ AETC/CCX and HQ AETC/IG. NOTE: If a commander views a
    congressional inquiry response as sensitive or controversial in nature, he or she will
    instruct HQ AETC/CCX to forward the response to AETC/CC or CV and DS. If the
    commander decides to conduct an IG investigation as a result of the inquiry, HQ
    AETC/IG will provide the final response regardless of the level at which the complaint
    was received (AFI 90-301).
       2.10.4.1. (Added-LUKEAFB) Assigned wing OPRs will prepare an in-depth
       response that accurately answers all questions highlighted in the received inquiry. 56
       FW/CC will review and approve (via signed memorandum) all replies to
       Congressional and High-Level inquiries. In the case of 56 FW/CC absences, the 56
       FW/CV will review and approve. 56 FW/IG will forward the approved/final response
       to the tasking agency and courtesy.
       2.10.4.2. (Added-LUKEAFB) The 56th Medical Group Commander (56 MDG/CC)
       will be the OPR for all Congressional or High-Level inquiries received through
       AF/SG channels; however, 56 FW/CC will review and approve the response via
       signed memorandum. If the response contains Protected Health Information, the 56
       MDG will ensure an authorized release, (DD form 2870, Authorization for Disclosure
       of Medical or Dental Information), is obtained from the patient prior to submitting a
       response to the 56 MDG/CC for signature. Should the patient refuse to submit a
       release, the 56 MDG/CC will ensure the response does not contain Protected Health
       Information. The 56 MDG will provide 56 FW/IG a copy of the final response.
    2.10.5. By the fifth day of the month following the month of the inquiry, ensure HQ
    AETC/IGQ has received copies of all congressional inquiries and responses to include
    official requests for information from SAF/LL, SAF/FML, HQ USAF, and/or Air Force
    Personnel Center (AFPC) for use in preparing responses to congressional inquiries.
    Provide HQ AETC/IGQ copies as needed to meet this requirement.
AETCI90-402_LUKEAFBSUP_I 22 APRIL 2011                                                        7


     2.10.6. Handle complaints or inquiries received directly from a member of Congress
     IAW AFI 90-401, but also send a courtesy copy to HQ AETC/CCX within 24 hours of
     receipt. Prepare a direct reply or interim response to the member of Congress if a
     complaint or inquiry was received directly from the member of Congress. Provide a
     courtesy copy of the final response to HQ AETC/CCX and HQ AETC/IGQ.
  2.11. For congressional visits, commanders of wings, NAFs, AU and AFRS, as applicable,
  will:
     2.11.1. Appoint a project officer as the POC for the visit. NOTE: The POC will contact
     HQ AETC/CCX and coordinate the proposed itinerary with the assigned SAF/LL or
     SAF/FML POC and HQ AETC/CCX.
     2.11.1. (LUKEAFB) 56 FW units will immediately notify 56 FW Public Affairs (PA)
     of all requests by members of Congress or Congressional staff members scheduling site
     visits to Luke AFB. After notification to 56 FW/CC/CV, 56 FW/PA will notify HQ
     AETC/CCX. The notification will include an outline of issues for discussion and an
     itinerary coordinated with 56 FW/CCP and 56 FW Community Action Initiatives.
     2.11.2. Encourage members of Congress to visit their installation for official functions,
     ceremonies, and open houses. Such activities provide members of Congress the
     opportunity to become familiar with Air Force missions and personnel located in their
     district. Installation orientation visits for newly elected members of Congress are
     particularly recommended.
        2.11.2.1. (Added-LUKEAFB) All requests for members of Congress or
        Congressional Staff visiting Luke AFB will be forwarded by 56 FW/PA to 19 AF and
        HQ AETC/PA (via 56 FW/CIT and through 56 FW/CC) for AETC/CV approval. A
        copy of the invitation will then be forwarded to SAF/LL, accompanied by a cover
        letter explaining the details of the event. This will be accomplished 60 days prior to
        scheduled visit, or ASAP upon notification less than 60 days prior to schedule visit.
     2.11.3. Comply with AFI 90-401 regarding handling of invitations. Routine invitations
     include those for air shows and open houses, activation and inactivation ceremonies, and
     other special events of a nonsensitive nature. (Contact HQ AETC/PA for information
     regarding invitations not falling into this category.) See Attachment 2 for a sample letter
     of invitation.
     2.11.4. Before dispatching invitations to SAF/LL, ensure the invitation format is IAW
     AFI 90-401 and this instruction. The signed invitation and cover letter should explain the
     details of the event 60 days in advance. If a 60-day notice is not possible, contact HQ
     AETC/CCX to confirm the best way to extend the invitation. Make no public
     announcement until SAF/LL confirms the guest will attend. Do not mention
     transportation of members, employees, or spouses in the invitation.
     2.11.5. Not commit the Air Force to providing transportation until notified by SAF/LL
     that transportation is approved.
     2.11.6. Report visits by members of Congress and staff representatives IAW AFI 90-401
     and this instruction.

            2.11.6.1. (Added-LUKEAFB) 56 FW/CIT will provide AETC/CCX a synopsis of
            the outcome of the visits and any issues discussed during a Congressional visit that
            would be of interest to the AETC/CC or CV, regardless of whether SAF/LL or
            SAF/FML escorted the visit.
        2.11.7. Submit orientation flight requests IAW AFI 11-401, Flight Management, through
        19 AF/DO.
        2.11.8. Send HQ AETC/CCX an after-action report within 5 duty days after the last day
        of a congressional visit. See Attachment 3 for the proper report format.
     2.12. Wing commanders (only) will:
        2.12.1. Contact HQ AETC/CCX to schedule their annual trip to Washington DC to visit
        with congressional members from their state or district.
        2.12.2. Via e-mail, provide HQ AETC/CCX with a post-visit report summarizing the
        visit. Also provide an info copy to the NAF commander.

        2.13.1. Act as the field unit POC for coordinating responses to congressional inquiries
        and ensuring compliance with AFI 90-401 and this instruction. (In the absence of an
        installation IG position, the unit commander will designate a POC for congressional
