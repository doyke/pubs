Air Force Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS) operations encompass worldwide
missions, day and night. For daily operations and times of crises the Air Force (including the Air
National Guard and Air Force Reserves) requires rules and procedures to support safe and
successful Air Force unmanned aircraft operations. This directive provides the policy to ensure
safe and successful Air Force SUAS operations.

Submit proposed changes to this directive through functional channels to the office of primary
responsibility (OPR) using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Ensure
that all records created as a result of processes described in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Distribution Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.

SUMMARY

This is an initial AFPD. However, it does supersedes the CONOPS listed in the above
supersession line.

1. General. Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) Joint Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for
Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) categorized the entire Department of Defense (DOD) UAS
family based on the enduring attributes of weight, altitude and speed. Based on this
categorization methodology, Air Force SUAS operations encompass systems from Groups 1, 2,
2                                                                 AFPD11-5 17 AUGUST 2009


and 3. SUAS rules and procedures are closely aligned to crews of manned aircraft and
operations. The similarities include: aerial platforms; disciplined, professional operators/crews;
use of airspace; requirement for aviation maintenance/logistical support; and training. Mission
requirements, SUAS capabilities, airspace of intended operations, and assessed risks are all
factors used to determine operator training and qualification requirements. All Major
Commands (MAJCOMs), Field Operating Agencies (FOAs), and Direct Reporting Units (DRUs)
will comply with guidance published in the applicable SUAS Group Air Force Instructions
(AFIs).
2. Responsibilities:
    2.1. The Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, Plans, and Requirements (AF/A3/5)
    establishes and interprets SUAS policy and shall:
       2.1.1. Provide oversight for SUAS rules and procedures.
       2.1.2. Approve or delegate approval authority for AFI 11-502, (Volume 1, 2, and 3) and
       the corresponding SUAS Group-specific AFIs.
    2.2. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) is the designated lead command for
    SUAS, executes its responsibilities IAW Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-9, Lead
    Command Designation and Responsibilities For Weapon Systems, and shall:
       2.2.1. Coordinate with all user commands to establish guidance for SUAS Groups 1, 2,
       and 3.
       2.2.2. Consider the widely varying missions when developing and coordinating
       publications for each SUAS Group.
       2.2.3. Designate and enforce use of a SUAS data management system. Information may
       be used to manage flying qualification, operator currency and training, system
       availability and status, and trend analysis. EXCEPTION: Air Force Materiel Command
       (AFMC) will incorporate a SUAS information management system into its own
       command-wide data manager.
    2.3. The Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff, Director of Operations (AF/A3O) establishes and
    manages policy for training, standardization/evaluation (stan/eval) and general operations
    procedures and shall:
    2.4. Serve as the OPR for the lead SUAS AFIs: AF/A3O-AS will be the OPR for AFI 11-
    502, Volume 1, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Training and Volume 2, Small Unmanned
    Aircraft Systems Standardization/Evaluation Program; AFFSA/A3O will be the OPR for
    Volume 3, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operations.
    2.5. The lead MAJCOM or FOA will establish and manage guidance and instructions for
    training, stan/eval and system operations procedures. The lead MAJCOM/FOA will
    coordinate with users to establish the guidance for SUAS training, stan/eval and operations
    procedures. Lead MAJCOM/FOAs need to be sensitive to the widely varying missions of
    SUAS users when developing and coordinating these publications. Lead MAJCOM/FOA for
    each new AFI 11-5 series are as follows:

       operational procedures.
    3.3. AFMC will author a combined flight test publications set to govern AFMC flight
    operations. Procedures will be published in AFI 11-5FT, Volumes 1, 2 and 3.
    3.4. SUAS Group-specific tactics and fundamental procedures may be incorporated as non-
    directive tactical level doctrine. These documents will be established by the Lead and User
    MAJCOMs and incorporated into Air Force Tactics Techniques and Procedures (AFTTPs)
    3-1 and 3-3.
4. Publications Supplements:
    4.1. MAJCOMs and FOAs may supplement AFI 11-502 or applicable SUAS Group-specific
    AFIs. These supplements will not be less restrictive than the lead-AFIs. Forward proposed
    supplements to AFI 11-502 Volumes 1, 2, or 3 to the appropriate Air Staff OPR for approval.
    Forward MAJCOM-approved supplements to SUAS Group-specific AFIs to the lead
    MAJCOM.
    4.2. Limit SUAS Group-specific and AFI supplements to unique requirements only.
    4.3. In order to promote maximum interoperability and standardization procedures, use only
    the basic SUAS Group-specific AFI when conflicting guidance exists between forces from
    Lead and User commands.
       4.3.1. If necessary, commanders may use MAJCOM, FOA or theater-specific
       supplements and procedures with forces under their operational control. Theater
       commanders will provide the appropriate training; specify the duration of the procedures
       to be used; and ensure all participating forces understand the procedures.

  Author and Internal Coordination - MAJCOM OPR determines the need for a conversion of
revision (NLT 2 years from AFI publishing date).
2
  Field Coordination - MAJCOM OPR coordinates draft AFI with user commands. The
proposed forms are submitted to AFDPO at this time.
3
  AFI Resolution - MAJCOM OPR consolidates comments and deliberates issues. If unable
to resolve at MAJCOM level, forward issues to AF/A3O-AS or AFFSA/A3O for ultimate
conflict resolution by the AF/A3O. A final draft is then published.
4
  Edit - MAJCOM OPR develops the final package and submits it to AF/A3O-AS or
AFFSA/A3O for coordination and approval. The MAJCOM OPR forwards the final AFI to
the User commands to begin writing appropriate supplements.
5
  Headquarters Air Force Coordination - AF/A3O-AS or AFFSA/A3O will coordinate with
appropriate offices designated in AFI 33-360. The 45-day period is established for one full
edit cycle to input the proposed changes at the Headquarters level.
6
 Publishing - Due to the required submission dates the 30 days will cover publication and
posting on the AF Publications web site.
