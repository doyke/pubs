        1.1.1.1. Oversee Privacy Act training on Holloman AFB.
        1.1.1.2. Routinely audit Electronic Records Management (ERM), SharePoint and shared
        drive folder permissions to assess whether Holloman AFB units effectively protect
        electronic documents containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
        1.1.1.3. Provide Privacy Act training to Unit Privacy Monitors at the Records
        Management classroom training (bldg 839).
        1.1.1.4. Process and monitor        all   Privacy   Act   incidents   and   breaches   (see
        HOLLOMANAFBVA 33-6).
     1.1.2. Unit Privacy Monitor. Each unit will appoint a Privacy Monitor by memorandum.
     Usually this duty is assigned to the Functional Area Records Manager (FARM). The Unit
     Privacy Monitor will:
        1.1.2.1. Ensure that their unit protects PII in accordance with AFI 33-332, Air Force
        Privacy Program.
        1.1.2.2. Provide and track initial Privacy Act training for all new unit personnel.
        1.1.2.3. Provide and track annual Privacy Act refresher training for their functional area.
        They are required to report Privacy Act training statistics to the Knowledge Operations
        Management Center (KOMC) quarterly.
        1.1.2.4. Ensure that all DoD personnel, volunteers and contractors are trained upon
        appointment and then annually in the principles and requirements of the Privacy Act.
        1.1.2.5. Ensure that all DoD personnel, including contractors, involved in the design,
        development, operation and maintenance of any system of records comply with the

        system of record.
        1.1.2.6. Review all publications and forms originated in their unit. The review will

        HOLLOMANAFBVA 33-6).

   an official need to know the information to perform their job. Units must put appropriate
   access controls in place to ensure access is restricted to authorized individuals. In addition,
   units should review the contents of shared drives or folders routinely to make certain that PII
   and other sensitive information is available only to personnel with a legitimate need to know.
   1.2.3. Recall Rosters. Recall rosters contain PII and should only be shared with small
   groups at the lowest levels for official purposes to reduce the number of people with access
   to such personal information (see AFI 33-332, para 6.1.1.1.). Commanders and supervisors
   must give consideration to those individuals with unlisted phone numbers. In those
   instances, disclosure to the Commander or immediate supervisor should be sufficient.
1.3. Destruction of Media. 100% destruction is the preferred method for the protection of
information maintained on any media source.
   1.3.1. Unclassified Media. In accordance with AFI 33-364, Records Disposition –
   Procedures and Responsibilities, para 5.10.2.1., unclassified material that does not contain
   For Official Use Only (FOUO) (i.e., catalogs, advertisements, newspapers) is considered
   destroyed when disposed of in a waste container.
       1.3.1.1. All other unclassified paper products on Holloman AFB will be destroyed
       (burned, shredded, etc.) when no longer needed to prevent the inadvertent disclosure
       and/or reconstruction of this material. If the material cannot be shredded, units are
       required to find an alternate method of destruction. Pulverizing and burning are approved
       methods of destroying unclassified material.
   1.3.2. Critical and/or Sensitive Unclassified Media. Sensitive unclassified information (to
   include Privacy Act, FOUO, privileged, or proprietary information) must be destroyed by
   any means approved for classified information or by any means that would make it difficult
   to recognize or reconstruct the information. The KOMC shredding facility (bldg 839) may
   be used to destroy critical and/or sensitive unclassified material. Call 572-7427 to make a
   shredding appointment.
   1.3.3. Destruction of Classified Documents. Destroy classified information according to
   AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management (para 5.28). A National Security
   Agency (NSA) compliant shredder is available in the KOMC shredding facility (bldg 839) to
   destroy classified documents. An NSA-compliant disintegrator is available in the KOMC
   shredding facility (bldg 839) to destroy classified mixed media (thumb drives, CD-ROMs,
   cell phones, etc. Call 572-7427 to make a shredding appointment.
1.4. E-mailing PII. PII may be e-mailed; however, the e-mail must include the correct Privacy
Act Statement (PAS). Do not indiscriminately attach a PAS to signature blocks when sending e-
mails. The PAS should only be applied to e-mails that contain PII. Contact the Knowledge
Operations Management Center (bldg 839) at 575-7247 for questions regarding e-mailing PII.
   1.4.1. All e-mails that contain PII must state FOUO at the beginning of the subject. The
   following statement must precede the text of the e-mail:
       1.4.1.1. This e-mail contains FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO) information which
       must be protected under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C 552) and/or the
       Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). Unauthorized disclosure or misuse of this
       PERSONAL INFORMATION may result in disciplinary action, criminal and/or civil
