1. General. The 1st Maintenance Group (MXG) Commander is responsible for establishing a
CDDAR program. The 1st Maintenance Squadron (1 MXS), Maintenance Flight will manage
the program and has the primary responsibility for conducting CDDAR operations. 1 MXS
Maintenance Flight will develop CDDAR procedures in coordination with the Base Fire

       will need to load the funding onto the card prior to use. In addition, the end-user may use
       their organizational GPC to purchase any stockpiled items up front as part of their
       planning process.

    2.16. 1 MXS Maintenance Flight will:
       2.16.1. Provide the CDDAR team chief who will be a SNCO or civilian equivalent
       (MXG/CC may waive grade requirement to TSgt or civilian equivalent), approved by the
       MXG/CC, and tracked on the Special Certification Roster (SCR) as required by AFI 21-
       101, Para 14.10.5.8.1.
       2.16.2. Provide a basic CDDAR team for In-Flight Emergencies (IFEs) and Ground
       Emergencies (GEs). The basic CDDAR team will have at least three personnel
       consisting of at least one qualified CDDAR 7-level or above. The basic CDDAR team
       will consist of a tow super qualified CDDAR team supervisor, an additional CDDAR
       qualified member and a licensed tow vehicle operator. The owning unit may be tasked
       with providing an aircraft tow vehicle and a licensed tow vehicle operator as needed
       during IFEs and GEs. All CDDAR team members will be familiar with local hot brake
       and aircraft barrier engagement procedures as outlined in local checklists. The CDDAR
       team will not perform any recovery operations until cleared by the IC/ROC.
       2.16.3. Dispatch the basic CDDAR team immediately if an emergency occurs during
       normal operating periods or duty hours. A basic CDDAR team will be on stand-by
       outside normal operating hours and will be recalled by the Maintenance Operations
       Center (MOC) in the event of an aircraft emergency. If the emergency requires more
       than the basic CDDAR team, the CDDAR team chief will recall additional CDDAR team
       members as needed. These members may be tasked to perform the duties outlined in the
       Attachment 2.
       2.16.4. Upon notification, dispatch a CDDAR team chief to an off-base accident site to
       evaluate personnel, equipment and tools needed for CDDAR operations.
       2.16.5. Coordinate with current crane rental contractor and contracting representative if
       the Grove RT990 crane is down for maintenance and one is needed for CDDAR
       operations.
       2.16.6. Ensure the CDDAR team conducts CDDAR operations in a minimum time
       period consistent with the following considerations: requirement to open runway for
       operational use, prevention of secondary damage to aircraft and preservation of evidence
       for mishap or accident investigation board.
       2.16.7. Tow all emergency aircraft clear of the active runway to allow the owning unit
       access to their aircraft and allow the CDDAR team to immediately regenerate. The
       owning unit will be responsible for completing the towing operation to the designated
       parking location.
       2.16.8. In the event that a crashed, damaged, or disabled aircraft is on the runway the 1st
       FW/CC or designated representative will determine the degree of urgency required to
       clear the runway. If immediate aircraft removal priority is given, the ROC has the option
       of using heavy construction equipment for its removal. This action must be coordinated
       with Airfield Management. The ROC will direct the operation and assist as necessary to
       remove the aircraft from the runway as the situation warrants.
