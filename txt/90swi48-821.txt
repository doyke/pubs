should be added to the inventory.

        4.3. The written work area/shop hazard communication program must include a list of hazardous
chemicals known to be present in a work area/shop (the list may be compiled for the work area/shop as a
whole or for specified and readily distinguishable portions of a work area/shop). The identity that is used
on the MSDS must be cross-referenced to the inventory. Where accessible, the inventory may be main-
tained in the ESOH-MIS.

5. Contractor Operations:

        5.1. The Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO),
("[Click here - type in the ADO's office symbol and phone #]"), with assistance from BES
("[Click here - type in BES' office symbol and phone #]" ), and work area supervisor
("[Click here - type in Supervisor's office symbol and phone #]" ), if requested, will advise
contractors of hazardous chemicals they may encounter and protective measures needed in the
normal course of their work in this work area. The ACO will also inform the contractor that
MSDS information is available through the
"[Click here - type in BES or other disignated location]"
("[Click here - type in appropriate office symbol, bldg #, & phone #]" ) and provide information
on the labeling system.

         5.2. At the pre-performance conference, and subsequently during the contract performance period,
the requiring activity quality assurance evaluator will advise work area supervisors and AF employees
monitoring the performance of contractors of hazardous chemicals introduced by the contractor. The con-
tractor is required to submit information on the use of hazardous materials according to FAR clause
5352.223.9002, Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data.

6. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials

        6.1. Non-routing tasks are:

               6.1.1. Those tasks included within a work area’s normal activities but performed infre-
quently; for example, cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent, or cleaning up spills.

                 6.1.2. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)
or job series.
10                                                                     90SWI48-821 10 AUGUST 2006



       6.2. The work area supervisor will list all non-routine tasks performed in this work area which
involve hazardous material (Atch 3). The supervisor will ensure work area operating instructions (OIs)
thoroughly describe non-routine tasks, associated hazards, and controls, for the infrequent tasks per-
formed in this work area. OIs do not need to be prepared if technical orders (TOs) or other official docu-
ments adequately describe these tasks. Supervisors will ensure workers review these procedures before
performing any non-routine tasks.

        6.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor of the
activity will ensure these workers receive the following training prior to beginning the activity:

           6.3.1. The initial Employee Information and Training Program described in Paragraph 2.7
of AFOSH STD 90-821, Hazard Communication, for workers not previously trained.

               6.3.2. Supplemental training, as necessary, on work area specific chemical hazards and
associated controls.

        6.4. The supervisor of the activity will forward a letter to the worker’s formal supervisor describ-
ing the training conducted so the individual’s AF IMT 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, can be
updated.
