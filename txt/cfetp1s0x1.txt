Part I

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive core-training
document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources, and
minimum core task requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide personnel a clear
career path to success and will instill vigor in all aspects of career field training.

NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position
qualification training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts; both are used by supervisors to plan, manage, and control
training within the career field.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A
explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information,
duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each skill
level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, training, education, and experience); Section D
indicates resource constraints associated with formal and on-the-job training (OJT). Some
examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities. NOTE: Air Force Classification
Directory contains the job descriptions.

2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and
includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training
Command (AETC) conducted training and correspondence course requirements. Section B
contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if airmen
satisfied training requirements; Section C identifies available support materials. An example is a
Qualification Training Package (QTPs which may be developed to support proficiency training).
These packages are located in www.e-publishing.af.mil; Section D identifies a training course
index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training. Included here are
both mandatory and optional courses; Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements
supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs;
Section F identifies continuing professional development; and Section G identifies career
development plan; and Section H identifies safety certifications.

NOTE: Training is the same for wartime and peacetime except it will be conducted 10 hours
a day and 6 days a week.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive
effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan will enable us
to train today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use
Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

Section A – General Information

1. Purpose. This CFETP provides information necessary for Air Force Career Field Managers
(AFCFMs), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors
and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program. This
plan outlines the training that individuals must receive to develop and progress throughout their
career. This plan identifies entry, initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and continuation
training. Entry level training is introductory, knowledge-based training; it is referred to as Safety
101. Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the
Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Normally, this
training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers. Upgrade training identifies
the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion
requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels. Qualification training is actual hands-
on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position. This
training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to
provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job. Advanced training is formal
specialty training used for selected airmen. Continuation training provides additional training that
exceeds minimum requirements with emphasis on present or future duty assignments. Proficiency
training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-
the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum
required for upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes; some are:

1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training
program. It is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate points in an individual’s
career.

1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in this specialty and
recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.

1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty and identifies sources of training.

1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career
field-training program.

2. Uses. This plan will be used by all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training
programs are available for each individual in the specialty.

2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field and
exportable training based on requirements established by users and documented in Part II of the
CFETP. They will also work with AFCFM to develop procurement and acquisition strategies for
obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.

2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory entry, initial,
upgrade, and proficiency requirements. Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident
training, contract training, or exportable courses. MAJCOM-developed training to support this
AFS must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate existing training.



                                                   4
2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory requirements specified in this plan. The lists of
courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority. Also, the AFCFM will
initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM
representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field
training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

accomplish its mission. Everyone involved in training must do their part to plan, develop, and
manage an effective training program. This part of the CFETP provides guidance to ensure
individuals receive viable training at appropriate points in their career. The following narrative
identifies an individual’s career training path and requirements.

5.1 Entry (1-Skill) Level Training: Entry level training in the Safety Specialty consists of Safety
101: Introduction to USAF Ground Safety program. Member is enrolled upon retrain selection and
must complete prior to Apprentice Level training.

5.2. Apprentice (3-Skill) Level Training: Initial skills training in the Safety Specialty consists of
task and knowledge training provided in the resident course. Task and knowledge training
requirements are identified in STS 1S0X1, which is included in Part II, Section A.

5.3. Journeyman (5-Skill) Level Training: Upgrade training to the 5-skill level in the Safety
Specialty consists of task and knowledge training provided in the Career Development Course
(CDC) and appropriate OJT. To be awarded AFSC 1S051 an individual must complete CDC

based on an individual’s duty position. Again, continuation training is available, but not limited to
the training in Part II, Section D.



                                                  7
5.6. Superintendent (9-Skill) Level Training: A 9-skill level is awarded to all Senior Master
Sergeants.

6. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to
encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Safety career field. The CFETP
includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet these training requirements. The strategy
must ensure we develop affordable training, eliminate duplication, and prevent a fragmented
approach to training. The following training decisions were made at the career field Utilization
and Training Workshop (U&TW) held at JBSA Lackland TX, 30 Apr – 4 May 2012.

6.1. 1- Level Entry Training: Upon selection to safety career field prior to entering 3-skill level
training the member will be placed in entry level (1-level) and must complete Safety 101,
Introduction to USAF Ground Safety program.

6.2. 3-Level Initial Skills Training: Upon completion of the Apprentice Safety course, conducted
at the training center, students will be awarded the 3-skill level and the OSHA 511 course
completion certificate.

6.3. 5-Level Upgrade Training: This is the second step in the training structure of the 1S0X1
career field. The objective is to fully qualify 5-levels to perform tasks without supervision in the
following time line:

6.3.1    Training will begin after mandatory completion of the 3-level resident course.

6.3.2    The CDC will be completed within 12 months of enrollment.

6.3.3 Completion of all unit directed and core task training identified in the STS/AFJQS.

6.4 7-Level Upgrade Training: Timely progression to the 7-level is critical to meet mission
    requirements.

6.4.1.   The trainee must complete core tasks identified in the STS/AFJQS.

6.4.2. The trainee must complete the 7-level Safety Craftsman course. The in-residence course
should not be scheduled until the individual completes all task qualification, and the supervisor
determines that the individual is ready for upgrade.

6.5 Proficiency Training. Proficiency training is critical to the development of the Safety
   Professional and the “Mission.” The proficiency training program provides additional
   advanced training exceeding the minimum upgrade training requirements with the emphasis on
   present and future duty positions. Professional development does not cease once upgrade
   has been completed.

6.6 Safety managers will ensure their OJT program complies with the requirements outlined in AFI
36-2201, On the Job Training Administration.

Part II

Section A – Specialty Training Standard

SAFETY APPRENTICE/JOURNEYMAN/CRAFTSMAN (1S0X1)

1. Implementation. The implementation of this STS for technical training provided by Air
Education and Training Command is with the 3-level Apprentice class beginning 6 Jan 2014 and
the 7-level craftsman class beginning 2 Dec 2013.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:

2.1. Lists in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks,
knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and
7-skill level. Column 3 identifies, by an asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements (core
tasks) requirements.

2.2. Provides certification for OJT. Column 4 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge
training requirements. Use automated training management systems to document technician
qualifications, if available. Task certification must show a certification/completed date.

2.3. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Columns 2a and 2c show the
level to which task/knowledge training has been accomplished by the Training Center for 1S031
and 1S071 courses respectively, as described in the Education & Training Course Announcement
(ETCA). When two codes are used in columns 2a and 2c, the first code is the established
requirement for resident training on the task/knowledge, and the second code indicates the level of
training provided in the course due to equipment shortages or other resource constraints. Column
2b indicates the career knowledge provided in CDC 1S051. See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing
maintained by the unit training manager for current CDCs.                  Column 2d identifies
exportable/supplemental courses, as applicable, that will be used to enhance student knowledge
during 5-level continuation training and prior to attending the formal 7-level course. Columns 3a
and 3b identifies minimum core task training requirements for award of AFSCs 1S051 and 1S071
respectively. MAJCOM 1S0 functional managers have waiver authority for core tasks identified
in this plan. The approved waiver will be maintained in the individual’s training record (AF Form
623). Column 4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of
training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.
Certification is accomplished as outlined in the AFI 36-2202.

2.4. Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate
the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.

2.5. This STS becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in
AF Form 623, On-the-Job Training, and used according to AFI 36-2201. When used as a JQS,
the following requirements apply:

2.5.1. Documentation. Document completion of training in accordance with AFI 36-2201.
Identify duty position requirements by circling the subparagraph number next to the task
statement. As a minimum, complete the following columns in Part II of the CFETP: Training
                                                20
Completed, Trainee Initials, and Trainer Initials. An AFJQS may be used in lieu of Part II of the
CFETP only upon approval of the AFCFM. NOTE: The AFCFM may supplement these
minimum documentation procedures as needed or deemed necessary for their Career Field.

2.5.1.1. Converting from Existing to New CFETP. Use the new CFETP to identify all past and
current qualifications. For those tasks previously certified and required in the current duty
position, evaluate current qualifications using current date as completion date and enter trainer’s
initials and trainee’s initials. For previous verification on tasks not required in the current duty
position, carry forward only the previous completion dates. If and when these tasks become a duty
position requirement, enter with current date trainer’s initials and trainee’s initials.

2.5.1.2. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available, the supervisor
identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, as a
minimum, that trainees cover the mandatory items in AFECD. For two-time CDC course exam
failures supervisors identify all STS items corresponding to the areas covered by the CDC. The
trainee completes a study of STS references, undergoes evaluation by the task certifier, and
receives certification on the STS. NOTE: Career knowledge must be documented prior to
submitting a CDC waiver.

2.5.1.3. Decertification and Recertification. When an airman is found to be unqualified on a task
previously certified for his or her position, the supervisor lines through the previous certification or
deletes previous certification when using automated system. Appropriate remarks are entered on
the AF Form 623A, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to the reason for
decertification. The individual is recertified (if required) either by erasing the old entries and
writing in the new or by using correction fluid (if the entries were made in ink) over the previously
certified entry.

2.5.2. Training Standard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the go/no-go level. Go means the
individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy,
timeliness, and correct use of procedures.

2.6. Specialty Training Standard (STS). Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in
the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Senior NCOs with extensive practical
experience in their career fields develops Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) at the USAF Airman
Advancement Division. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test
development team member as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are
based upon study references listed in the Enlisted promotions references and Requirements
Catalog (EPRRC). Examinee responsibilities are in Chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military
Personnel Testing system. WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Force
Reserves.

3. Recommendations. Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates to the
37 TRG/DOS, 1220 Truemper Street, Suite 1, JBSA Lackland TX 78236-5724. Reference specific
STS paragraphs. A customer service information line has been installed for the supervisor’s
convenience to identify graduates who may have been over- or under-trained on task/knowledge
items listed in this training standard. For a quick response to problems, call our customer service
information line, Defense Switching Network (DSN) 473-2917, anytime day or night.
