1. General. Concept of Operations: This instruction describes procedures for the 374 AW/CC
to expedite time-critical information to all assigned military and civilian personnel. The primary
method of recalling personnel is the Pyramid Recall System (PRS). It is the responsibility of
each unit to develop and maintain a current Pyramid Recall Roster (PRR) that will immediately
recall all assigned personnel. All 374 AW assigned group and squadron commanders (CC) will
update the 374 AW Command Post (374 AW/CP) with current contact information and
availability (office, cellular and home phone numbers, TDY location, crew rest/flying etc)
whenever there are changes in status. Tenant units must provide and maintain accurate lists of
points of contact (POC) to their respective notification centers (e.g., 374th Operations Group
Crisis Action Team Representative [374 OG CAT Rep], 374th Mission Support Group [374
MSG CAT Rep], etc.) as well as the 374 AW/CP. All groups will provide an updated PRR for
each of their assigned units to the 374 AW/CP no later than the 7th day of each month. Tenant
units will provide an updated PRR to their respective Group CAT Rep and the 374 AW/CP NLT
the 7th day of March, June, September and December. All PRR updates should be executed via
encrypted email. Send PRR updates to the 374 AW/CP at 374aw.cp@us.af.mil.
     1.1. The term “unit” refers to all units assigned to the 374 AW and all tenant units. Tenant
     units will be recalled at the discretion of the 374 AW/CC.
2. Command and Control. The pyramid recall system may be implemented using either
communications-in (comm-in) or communications-out (comm-out) procedures. If the 374
AW/CP is unsuccessful contacting a commander, but manages to contact a deputy commander
and/or an executive officer, that commander will be considered notified by the CP. It is the
responsibility of the notified member to contact his/her respective commander.
     2.1. Comm-In Recalls. During comm-in recalls, the primary method to notify personnel is
     by telephone. If an individual cannot be reached within two hours after recall execution, a
     runner should be sent to the member’s residence and/or work area (as needed).
YOKOTAABI10-202 10 JULY 2014                                                                     3


   2.2. Comm-Out Recalls. Under comm-out conditions, the 374 AW/CP may not be able to
   initiate a voice recall, or the nature of the threat requires a higher level of security. During
   comm-out recalls, the primary method to notify personnel is by dispatching pre-assigned
   runners during duty and non-duty hours. Depending on the situation, the 374 AW/CC and
   the 374 AW/CP will use any other means to ensure the recall is successful. Some options
   include, but are not limited, to the Giant Voice System, dispatching Security Forces
   personnel (patrol vehicle loudspeakers, if required), AFN TV/radio, AW’s social media page,
   AW’s web page, marquee, etc.
       2.2.1. Comm-Out maps. All units will include the building and/or room number of all
       members’ residences/dorms in their PRR. Members who reside off-base will turn in and
       file with their units a detailed map to their off-base residence that also depicts written
       driving instructions from one of YAB’s gate to their domicile. This map will be used
       during comm-out recalls if necessary.
       2.2.2. Once a comm-out recall execution is ordered, all individuals will report to their
       duty section with the exceptions listed in paragraph 2.2.3. Examples of situations
       requiring a comm-out or lost-comm recall would include earthquakes, typhoons, etc.
       2.2.3. CAT, EOC, and Unit Control Center (UCC) members will report to their
       respective facilities. Upon activation, the EOC and each UCC will send a runner unners
       in place of fax, email and telephone systems.
   2.3. To facilitate effective communications, the 374 AW has adopted the Group CAT
   Reps/UCC system to execute each PRS. Each group will have a CAT Rep responsible to
   their respective group CC. Wing Staff Agencies (WSA) will have a Group CAT Rep
   responsible to the 374 CPTS/CC, or designated representative, during PRS execution. Each
   squadron (or agency) within those groups will ensure all UCC responsibilities are fulfilled.
   The exceptions are the 374th Medical Group (374 MDG) which will only operate one UCC
   due to its size and nature of operation, and the 374th Maintenance Operations Squadron (374
   MOS) whose UCC functions are consolidated with the 374th Maintenance Group’s (374
   MXG) CAT Rep. Final control to deactivate the specific Group CAT Rep or UCC remains
   with the respective unit commander.
3. Control Center Activation. The Control Center activation options are as follows:
   3.1. Crisis Action Team activation. The CAT will be activated through a GOLD recall. The
   374 AW/CC is the authority to activate the CAT. For Accountability Recalls only a portion
   of the CAT (Group CAT Reps and UCCs only) is activated, unless full CAT activation is
   specified. Depending on the situation, during a GOLD recall the 374 AW/CC may allow the
   Group CAT Reps and UCCs execute their recall actions from a location other than the CAT’s
   work area and/or UCCs respectively. NOTE: The unit UCCs are not part of the basic CAT
   composition however, for the purpose of this instruction, unit UCCs will be activated with
   the CAT, unless otherwise instructed.
       3.1.1. Figure 1, CAT activation matrix, shows the proper communication flow for the
       CAT activation. Once the 374 AW/CC orders the CAT activation or to execute a PRS
       option, the 374 AW/CP will run the required recall checklist(s) and will notify the
       following units/agencies:
          3.1.1.1. 374 AW/CV

       3.1.1.16. 374 AW/ATO (if required)
       3.1.1.17. 374 AW/SE
    3.1.2. Each organization recalled by the 374 AW/CP is responsible to contact their CAT
    Group Reps (if required) and activate their unit’s PRS (if required).
       3.1.2.1. 374 AW/XP will be responsible to contact the CAT Admin personnel.
       3.1.2.2. 374 CPTS/CC is responsible to contact the WSA CAT Group Rep and the
       WSA Chiefs. WSA Chiefs will then initiate their units’ PRS.
       3.1.2.3. The 730 AMS/MOC will contact the 515 AMOG/CC and the 730 AMS/CC
       and coordinate the notification of their CAT Group Rep (if required).

   3.2. Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Activation. The EOC can be activated by the 374
   AW/CC or MSG/CC in combination with any recall option. Additional option #1 can be
   included in the recall verbiage to automatically activate the EOC. The 374 AW/CP will run
   the EOC activation quick reaction checklist (QRC) and will activate the EOC pager system.
   Afterwards, the CP will contact the EOC Director to verify that he/she received the pager
   notification. It is the EOC Director’s responsibility to ensure all the EOC stand-by members
   received the pager notification. The EOC may also be activated by the 374 AW/ CC as a
   standalone function via the 374 AW/CP. See Figure 2 for the EOC activation matrix.

4. Pyramid Recall Procedures. The recall process is initiated by the 374 AW/CP when
directed by the 374 AW/CC. The 374 AW/CC will determine which recall option to initiate
depending on the situation, or as directed by higher headquarters. The R-hour is the reference
time determined by the 374 AW/CC to initiate a recall/notification. The Q-hour is the time that
mobility operations will start in preparation for a deployment and will be determined by the 374
AW/CC or HHQs. Since accountability reports are due based upon the R-hour, this time will be
relayed to the CAT members and UCCs. Q-hour may be relayed for mobility recalls if
known/determined at the time of the recall. When directed by the 374 AW/CC, the 374 AW/CP
will contact the 374 AW/CV, 374 AW/CCC, 374 CPTS/CC, 374 AW/XP, 374 Group/CCs, and
the 730 AMS/MOC. The 374 CPTS/CC and Group CCs initiate their organizations’ PRSs. The
730 AMS/MOC will contact the 515 AMOG/CC, who in turn initiate their units’ PRSs. If the
applicable recall option activates the CAT, all group commanders, 374 AW/XP, and 374 CPTS/
CC will also follow the CAT’s activation instructions.
     4.1. Yokota AB recall options are as follows:
        4.1.1. BLUE (General Recall): Units and agencies initiate pyramid recall. Units DO
        NOT contact aircrew members in pre-departure crew rest and air traffic controllers in
        crew rest, unless authorized by the 374 AW/CC or 374 OG/CC. All personnel report to
        their duty section. CAT members will report immediately to the CAT facility. Upon
        arrival, CAT personnel will do a communications check to identify any issues with their
        equipment. Primary UCC members will report immediately to their workstations and
        contact their applicable CAT Group Reps and units. Once control center personnel are in
        place, they must contact the next control center in their chain to ensure a proper line of
        communication has been established. When directed by the 374 AW/CC, the Group
        CAT Reps will contact their assigned tenant units, if required (see Attachment 3).
        4.1.2. GOLD (Crisis Action Team Recall): CAT members will report immediately to the
        CAT facility. Upon arrival, CAT personnel will do a communications check to identify
        any issues with their equipment. Primary UCC members will report immediately to their
        workstations and contact their applicable CAT Group Reps and units. Once control
        center personnel are in place, they must contact the next control center in their chain to
        ensure a proper line of communication has been established. When directed by the 374
        AW/CC, the Group CAT Reps will contact their assigned tenant units, if required (see
        Attachment 3).
        4.1.3. Accountability Recalls. Group CAT Reps and UCCs will report immediately to
        their duty sections, activate their workstations and conduct a communications check.
        Units and agencies will initiate their pyramid recall procedures. Personnel will not report
        to their duty sections, unless specified otherwise by their chain of command. Units DO
        NOT contact aircrew members in pre-departure crew rest and air traffic controllers in
        crew rest. Group CAT Reps will contact their assigned tenant units (see Attachment 3)
        and have them initiate their PRS, if required. Group CAT Reps will be responsible for
        PRS’ completion for their units and assigned tenant units. Each unit will report on an
        hourly basis the percentage of members contacted until 100% completion, as specified in
        paragraph 4.4. NOTE: GOLD recalls are usually used to relay important information to
        the entire base population as soon as possible. Examples include TCCOR changes, AF
        wide recalls, regional accountability recalls, etc.
YOKOTAABI10-202 10 JULY 2014                                                                    7


   4.2. Additional recall options:

Table 1. Additional recall options
        Option 1 - Activates the EOC.
        Option 2 - Directs personnel to report to their unit carrying their chemical training
        gear and IPE (bagged).
        Option 3 - Directs the activation of the mobility work centers. Mobility augmentees
        will contact their UCCs for accountability and report to their mobility work center.
        Option 4 - Initiates the security forces augmentation program. Security forces
        augmentees will report to their UCCs for accountability and then proceed immediately
        to building 305.
        Option 5 - Do not recall non-mission essential civilian personnel (e.g., exercises, PRS
        test). These options may be executed individually or in combination with one another.

   4.3. Pyramid Recall System Execution. The 374 AW/CC will direct the 374 AW/CP to
   initiate the recall. The recall notification may add additional measures commensurate with
   the situation. In order to practice positive OPSEC, each recall shall use the proper
   codeword (BLUE, GOLD) and avoid using the terms “General Recall” and “CAT
   Activation” etc.
       4.3.1. Use the following verbiage during all recalls:―This is (Rank/Name). A (Blue or
       Gold) recall is in effect. Option(s) (1, 2 and/or 3) applies (If required). R-hour is (Time
       recall was initiated) (Add any additional information or instructions as given by the 374
       AW/CC or 374 AW/CV) ―.
          4.3.1.1. The 374 AW/CC has the option to pass additional information at the end of
          the verbiage if he/she deems necessary. In order to ensure the recall goes as precise
          as possible, it is highly encouraged that members write down the notification message
          and relay it word-by-word.
       4.3.2. If directed by the 374 AW/CC, the 374 AW/CP will begin recall announcements
       on the Giant Voice Public Address System at appropriate intervals until the CAT
       determines the wing has reached a mission-capable status.
   4.4. UCCs and Group CAT Reps will report and track personnel strength and accountability
   as directed by the CAT Director (Sharepoint, Excel, voice report etc). See Attachment 2 for
   required information to update the recall tracker. Personnel strength reporting begins at R-
   Hour plus 1 and continues every hour thereafter until all units have attained 100% personnel
   accountability. The 374 AW/CC’s goal is 100% contact of all accountable personnel by R-
   hour plus 3. The Installation Personnel Readiness (IPR) office, in coordination with the CAT
   Director, will be the focal point to collect/monitor recall information and make applicable
   reports to the 374 AW/CC. IPR will forward all recall status reports to higher headquarters,
   when requested. If IPR is directed to track recall status, all group CAT Reps will collect the
   data for their respective units and forward to them at DSN 225-8519/9518 or via email at
   NIPR: 374fss.fsoxi@us.af.mil or SIPR: 374mss.readiness@yokota.af.smil.mil. Note:
   Personnel on crew rest will be considered accounted for, unless directed to be recalled.

        4.4.1. Group CAT Reps and/or UCCs will establish dependent’s accountability
        procedures when sponsor is TDY or on leave, if required (natural emergencies, regional
        accountabilities etc).
5. Responsibilities.
     5.1. The 374 AW/CC will:
        5.1.1. Direct the 374 AW/CP to initiate the recall. Advise recall, control center
        activations, and Mobility READY team recall options. See Figure A4.2. for specific
        recall and activation options.
        5.1.2. Direct method of activation and/or recall (i.e., Comm-out).
     5.2. Group CCs and CPTS/CC will:
        5.2.1. Appoint a Group PRR Monitor. The Group PRR Monitor ensures subordinate
        units and assigned tenant units forward their respective PRRs to the Group CAT Reps as
        specified in paragraph 1.
        5.2.2. Maintain current copies of staff agency and subordinate unit recall rosters.
        5.2.3. Maintain comm-out recall procedures and maps for their respective units,
        including assigned tenant units.
        5.2.4. Ensure units under their command are notified in the event of a recall.
     5.3. Each unit (including tenants) will:
        5.3.1. Assign a PRR Monitor to update rosters monthly.
        5.3.2. Prepare and maintain pyramid recall rosters using the sample in Attachment 4,
        Figure A4.1, Figure A4.2, and the following guidelines:
            5.3.2.1. PRRs must contain, as a minimum: current as of date; a header which
            identifies the organization; identify recall roster monitor’s name, duty position and
            office phone number; unit member’s name, grade, residence address, residence
            telephone number, cell phone number (if applicable); a Privacy Act statement (PAS);
            the statement ―For Official Use Only (FOUO)―; and have the information
            contained in Figure A4.2. as the last page of the PRR (see Attachment 4). PRRs
            must also identify personnel housing locations next to the address element using the
            following abbreviations in parentheses: dorms (D), East housing (E), South housing
            (S), North housing (N), off-base housing (O), and West housing (W). Units are
            authorized to add additional information as needed.
            5.3.2.2. PRRs will also include the DSN telephone numbers for the unit’s UCC,
            alternate UCC, Group CAT Rep and alternate Group CAT Rep. Emergency
            telephone numbers are also highly encouraged. See Figure A4.1 for more guidance.
            Note: It is mandatory to have Figure A4.2. as the last page of all PRRs. This figure
            is maintained by the 374 AW/CP. Figure A4.1. is just an example to reference when
            preparing a PRR.
        5.3.3. Develop and maintain comm-out recall procedures and maps.
        5.3.4. Assign runners who are familiar with the primary and secondary comm-out routes.
YOKOTAABI10-202 10 JULY 2014                                                                  9


     5.3.5. If unable to contact the next individual on the roster within 5 minutes, contact the
     individual or individuals below that person in the PRR. Continue attempting contact with
     that person until instructed otherwise by your Group CAT Rep (consider dispatching a
     runner). The names of all individuals not contacted should be passed to the Group CAT
     Rep as soon as possible.
     5.3.6. Identify personnel on each PRR’s tier to report recall status to the UCC. Note: It
     is recommended that each unit test their pyramid recall at least semi-annually. Wing
     exercise recalls suffice for this recommendation.
  5.4. All military and civilian personnel will:
     5.4.1. When notified, initiate their required PRR notifications. Once complete, personnel
     will report immediately to their duty location or UCCs, if required. Notify their UCCs
     ASAP if unable to contact a member. Messages left in answering machines WILL NOT
     count as contacted.
     5.4.2. Inform their unit PRR Monitor and immediate supervisor of address and/or
     telephone number changes, to include providing a new or updated map to their quarters,
     as soon as the change occurs.
     5.4.3. Individuals residing off-base will provide their PRR Monitor, and supervisor or
     person responsible for contacting them, a detailed map of the area in which they reside
     using well known streets or land marks as a guide. Each map will include written
     instructions with the initial starting point at a gate in Yokota AB to the individual’s
     quarters.
     5.4.4. Properly dispose of obsolete rosters in such a manner as to prevent the
     unauthorized release of personal information (shredding, burning etc).
  5.5. The 374 AW/CP will:
     5.5.1. Maintain current recall rosters of all 374 AW and tenant units assigned or attached
     to Yokota AB.
     5.5.2. Maintain procedures to initiate the Pyramid Recall System IAW this instruction.
     5.5.3. Execute command center activations, and recalls of personnel and agencies when
     directed by the appropriate authority.
     5.5.4. Inform IPR of all units participating in a recall, if required.
     5.5.5. Activate Giant Voice systems when directed by 374 AW/CC.
     5.5.6. Initiate periodic tests of the PRS when directed. Tests will consist of telephonic
     contact of CAT/EOC members and/or selected units to determine their ability to perform
     control center activations and pyramid recall actions.

A2.1. UCCs and Group CAT Reps will report and monitor personnel strength using any tool
specified by the CAT Director (Sharepoint, Excel etc). Personnel strength accounting begins at
R-Hour plus 1 and continues every hour thereafter until all units have attained 100% personnel
accountability.
A2.2. The wing goal for strength reporting is: R+3, 100% personnel accountability.
A2.3. UCCs will provide the following information for assigned military personnel:
   A2.3.1. Number of personnel authorized. (Based on Unit Manning Document [UMD].)
   A2.3.2. Number of personnel assigned. (This figure will be based on the unit strength
   report.)
   A2.3.3. Number of personnel on leave.
   A2.3.4. Number of personnel TDY/deployed.
   A2.3.5. Other. (e.g., hospital, confinement, etc.)

   from paragraph A2.3.2.)
   A2.3.7. Number of personnel present for duty. (Present for duty is defined as the individual
   either being at his or her duty section or having been contacted, briefed on the current
   situation and made aware of duty requirements.)
   A2.3.8. Percentage recalled at present time. (Divide paragraph A2.3.7. by paragraph A2.3.6.
   and multiply by 100.)
A2.4. If the recall reporting is executed via voice report, all UCCs/Group CAT Reps will use the
method outlined below.
