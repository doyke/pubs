discipline specific mishaps. AFMAN 91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports,
provides additional guidance for investigating and reporting nuclear, guided missile, explosives
and chemical agents, and directed energy mishaps. AFMAN 91-222, Space Safety
Investigations and Reports, provides additional guidance for investigating and reporting space
mishaps. AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports, provides additional
guidance for investigating and reporting aviation mishaps. AFMAN 91-224, Ground Safety

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This change incorporates Interim Change 2006-1 and reflects DoDI 6055.7 guidance regarding
mishap categories. It also provides additional information on how to classify and record injuries.
It provides additional guidance for compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 and handling of
privileged information. It updates Table 6.2. Reporting and Briefing Schedule, and updates the
use of some AF Forms. Finally, it clarifies the definitions of some terms in Attachment 1. The
entire text of the IC is at the last attachment. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous
edition.

(AFMC) Clarifies and updates guidance for AFMC safety investigations, reports, and associated
program management. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is considered a center for this
supplement. The term ―single manager‖ (SM) in AFI 91-204 has been replaced by the updated
term ―system program manager‖ (SPM) in this supplement. HQ AFMC/SE‘s Materiel Safety
Database (DB10) will be maintained as a historical data base. The data in DB10 will be updated
as required; however no new records will be made in DB10 (new records will be made in
AFSAS) (7.4.7.2. (Added)). The AFMC IMT 12, Record of Injury/ Illness and Treatment has
been made obsolete. The OSHA Form 301, Injury and Illness Incident Report has been
adopted for AFMC use (6.1.3. (Added)).
(HILL) Paragraph 2.5.4.1. has been added to designate the center Materiel Safety Program
Manager (MSPM) and delegate the Materiel Safety Task Group (MSTG) functions. Office
symbols have also been updated.

                                         Chapter 1

                               GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose of Safety Investigations and Reports.
   1.1.1. Safety investigations and reports are conducted and written solely to prevent future
   mishaps. Safety investigations take priority over any corresponding legal investigations,
   except Friendly Fire mishaps (paragraph 4.11.1.). Conduct safety and legal investigations
   separately to protect privileged safety information in the safety report. Privileged safety
   information will be used solely for mishap prevention.
   1.1.2. Legal investigations provide a publicly releasable report of the facts and
   circumstances surrounding a mishap. Legal investigations may include a statement of
   opinion on the cause of the accident, gather and preserve evidence for claims, litigation,
   disciplinary and adverse administrative actions, and for all other purposes. An Accident
   Investigation Board (AIB) is one type of legal investigation and is convened for many
   space, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and missile mishaps IAW AFI 51-503,
   Aerospace Accident Investigations. A Commander Directed Investigation (CDI) is another
   type of legal investigation that may be convened for mishaps.
1.2. Waivers to this Instruction. Waivers to this instruction will be requested through the
MAJCOM/ SE to HQ USAF/SE.
1.3. Mishaps and Events that Require Safety Investigations and Reports.
1.3. (AFMC) Mishaps and Events that Require Safety Investigations and Reports. If a
Research and Development (R&D) test anomaly (an unplanned occurrence or test outcome)
occurs outside the confines of AFI 91-204, paragraph 1.3.3.12., the R&D facility will notify
the center/wing safety office within 8 hours of the occurrence. The center safety office will
contact HQ AFMC/SE to determine if the occurrence is a reportable mishap IAW AFI 91-204.
   1.3.1. A mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage
   or injury as described in paragraph 1.3.1.1. and meets Class A, B, C, or D mishap reporting
   criteria IAW paragraph 1.8. All mishaps require a safety investigation and report.
       1.3.1.1. Damage or injury includes: damage to DOD property; occupational illness to
       DOD military or civilian personnel; injury to DOD military personnel on or off-duty;
       injury to on-duty DOD civilian personnel; damage to public or private property, or
       injury or illness to non-DOD personnel caused by Air Force operations.
   1.3.2. An event is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that does not meet
   mishap reporting criteria as defined in paragraph 1.3.1. Class E events require a safety
   investigation and report.
   1.3.3. Exceptions to mandatory reporting requirements. The following occurrences do not
   need to be reported under this instruction. However, other instructions may require their
   reporting and the absence of a requirement for a safety report does not relieve the need to
   conduct an investigation.
8                         AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


    1.3.3.1. Damage or injury by direct action of an enemy or hostile force. This does not
    include suspected cases of Friendly Fire, which may involve a safety investigation and
    report IAW paragraph 4.11.1.
    1.3.3.2. Intentional, controlled, in-flight jettison or release of canopies, cargo, doors,
    drag chutes, hatches, life rafts, auxiliary fuel tanks, aerial refueling hoses, missiles,
    drones, rockets, explosive munitions, and externally carried equipment nonessential to
    flight. Includes intentional activation of flares, manually or by automatic countermeasure
    systems, with normal system function and no damage to property on the ground. NOTE:
    Report intentional jettison of missiles, drones, rockets, and munitions when the reason
    for jettison is their malfunction. Report all release of missiles or explosives that impact
    off range.
    1.3.3.3. Except when required to be reported as a Class E event, a report is not
    required for replacement of component parts due to normal wear and tear when all
    associated damage is confined to that component part. This "normal wear and tear"
    reporting exemption only applies to items that are normally used until they fail or until
    pre-determined wear limits are reached. If damage is not confined to the component part,
    all associated damage costs must be added to determine if the occurrence is a reportable
    mishap. Aircraft subsystems (such as engines, engine modules, APUs, landing gear, and
    gearboxes) are assemblies and NOT component parts. Flight line replaceable engine
    components and electronic boxes, tires, pump motors, and drag braces are examples of
    component parts.
    1.3.3.4. Injuries associated with non-occupational diseases, when the disease, not the
    injury, is the proximate cause of the lost time, such as diabetes and its resultant
    complications like loss of vision. Complications of the injury (such as the infection of
    a cut aggravated by a work-related activity) that result in lost time are reportable.
    1.3.3.5. Attempted or consummated suicide, homicide, or intentionally self-inflicted
    injuries, e.g., Russian roulette.
    1.3.3.6. Injuries resulting from altercations, attack, or assault, unless incurred in the
    performance of official duties when an attack or assault would not be a felony, such
    as a medical provider assaulted by an incompetent patient.
    1.3.3.7. Injuries sustained before entry into military service or employment by the US
    Government, unless specifically aggravated by current tenure of service.
    1.3.3.8. Hospitalization for treatment where the patient is retained beyond the day of
    admission solely for administrative reasons. Hospitalization for observation or
    administrative reasons not related to the immediate injury or occupational illness.
       1.3.3.8.1. Observation and/or Diagnostic Procedure. Hospitalization or
       restriction from assigned work activities for observation or diagnosis is not a "lost
       time case," "no lost time case," or "first aid case" provided no treatment or
       medication is given for the suspected injury or occupational illness and competent
       medical authority determines the individual could have returned to his or her normal
       job without impairment or disability. This classification also applies where an
       individual is temporarily restricted from regularly assigned duties to prevent
       exceeding time-weighted exposure limits.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                  9


     1.3.3.9. Injuries that result from the following:
        1.3.3.9.1. Pre-existing musculoskeletal disorders unless aggravated or accelerated by
        Federal employment.
        1.3.3.9.2. Minimum stress and strain (simple, natural, and nonviolent body
        positions or actions, as in dressing, sleeping, coughing, or sneezing.) Those are
        injuries unrelated to mishap-producing agents or environments normally associated
        with active participation in daily work or recreation.
     1.3.3.10. Injuries or fatalities to persons in the act of escaping from or eluding military or
     civilian custody or arrest.
     1.3.3.11. Death due to natural causes that are unrelated to the work environment.
     NOTE: Report the following deaths by natural causes:
        1.3.3.11.1. An aircrew member during flight.
        1.3.3.11.2. A missile crewmember on alert.
        1.3.3.11.3. A training-related death.
     1.3.3.12. Intentional or expected damage to DOD equipment or property incurred
     during authorized testing or combat training, including missile and ordnance firing or
     destruction of DOD property to prevent capture by an enemy or hostile force.
        1.3.3.12.1. Intentional electro-explosive device activation when part of it is a normal
        missile test or launch sequence, the launch is aborted, and there is no other reportable
        damage.
        1.3.3.12.2. Expected damage or destruction of equipment, pallets, parachutes, etc.,
        during airdrop operations.
        1.3.3.12.3. Damage to or destruction of Air Force equipment or property during
        authorized testing, including missile and ordnance firing, and UAVs used as targets
        or on critical profile missions, provided all of the following conditions exist:
            1.3.3.12.3.1. The extent of the damage or destruction was an expected or desired
            result of the test.
            1.3.3.12.3.2. The damage or destruction occurred at planned times and for
            anticipated reasons.
     1.3.3.13. Foreign object damage (FOD) to aircraft, air-breathing missiles, or drone/UAV
     engines discovered during scheduled engine disassembly (e.g., depot engine overhaul for
     maximum operating time, not for known or suspected FOD). NOTE: FOD may be
     reportable under TO 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating System.
     1.3.3.14. Property damage, death, or injury as a result of vandalism, riots, civil
     disorders, sabotage, terrorist activities, or criminal acts (where injury or property
     damage is intentional, e.g., arson).
        1.3.3.14.1. Motor vehicle mishaps. Although motor vehicle mishaps often result
        from some form of misconduct, e.g., speeding, driving while intoxicated, and
        reckless driving, they will be reported.
10                             AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


        1.3.3.15. Adverse bodily reactions resulting directly from the use of drugs under the
        direction of competent medical authority.

        1.3.3.17. Normal residual damage as a result of a missile launch.
        1.3.3.18. Injury or occupational illness to contractor personnel or damage to contractor
        property or equipment unless caused by DOD operations.
        1.3.3.19. ANG state employee (Title 5) injury or illness on- or off-duty unless their
        injury or illness mishap involved Air Force personnel, contractor operations, or property.
        1.3.3.20. Injuries or illness from animal, insect, or reptile bites to military
        personnel while off-duty.
        1.3.3.21. Natural phenomena ground mishaps where adequate preparation, forecasting,
        and communication actions were taken and there were no injuries to DOD personnel.
1.4. Acting on Critical Safety Information. If safety personnel or investigators discover
information that seriously impacts the operations of a weapons system, the continuation of an
exercise, or other operations; immediately notify the convening authority by telephone and
follow up with a confirming message, regardless of whether or not such information is
associated with a mishap currently under investigation. Convening Authority Safety Offices
will take action IAW paragraph 2.6.7.
1.5. Accounting for Losses. The Air Force records each mishap to the command (MAJCOM)
that experienced the loss of an owned asset (personnel or property). For statistical purposes,
the occurrence is recorded as a mishap in that command (or in the Air Force at large, when
applicable) regardless of any determination as to the responsibility for the mishap. Generally,
the mishap is recorded in the command that has investigative responsibility for the mishap
(Chapter 4). Mishap accounting in no way implies blame or mishap responsibility. NOTE:
For purposes of this instruction, the term "MAJCOM" includes ANG, DRUs, and FOAs.
1.6. Mishap Categories. The Air Force categorizes mishaps based upon the materiel
involved (e.g., space systems, weapons, aircraft, motor vehicles, person, etc.) and the state of the
involved materiel (e.g., launch, orbit, existence of intent for flight, on- or off-duty, etc.) when the
mishap occurs. Mishap categories and subcategories are defined below and diagramed in Figure
1.1. For the purposes of reporting and data collection, select the one category and subcategory
that best defines the mishap under investigation. Normally mishaps involve only one category
and subcategory, see paragraph 1.6.3.
     1.6.1. Specific Mishap Categories.
        1.6.1.1. Nuclear. An Air Force mishap involving radioactive materiel.
            1.6.1.1.1. Nuclear Weapon. A mishap that involves destruction of, or serious
            damage to, nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons systems, or nuclear weapons
            components, resulting in an actual or potential threat to national security or life and
            property. Reportable nuclear surety violations and damage to support equipment
            unique to a nuclear weapon system will be reported under this subcategory.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                11


        1.6.1.1.2. Reactor and Radiological. Mishaps involving fissile materiel used in a self-
        supporting chain reaction (i.e., nuclear fission) to produce heat and/or radiation
        for both practical application and research and development.
     1.6.1.2. Space. An Air Force mishap involving a space system and/or unique space
     support equipment.
        1.6.1.2.1. Pre-Launch. Space mishaps occurring during ground handling,
        processing, and transportation operations.
        1.6.1.2.2. Launch. Space mishaps occurring during launch vehicle operations,
        including upper stages. This includes payloads that do not obtain orbit and range
        safety system failures.
        1.6.1.2.3. Orbit. Space mishaps occurring during spacecraft operation after
        separation from all launch vehicle components, including upper stages and transfer
        motors.
     1.6.1.3. Aviation. An Air Force mishap involving a DOD aircraft or DOD UAV.
        1.6.1.3.1. Aircraft Flight. Any mishap in which there is intent for flight and
        reportable damage to a DOD aircraft. Explosives and chemical agents or guided
        missile mishaps that cause damage in excess of $20,000 to a DOD aircraft with intent
        for flight are categorized as aircraft flight mishaps to avoid dual reporting. This is the
        only aviation mishap subcategory that contributes to the flight mishap rate.
        1.6.1.3.2. Aircraft Flight-Related. Any mishap in which there is intent for flight and
        no reportable damage to the DOD aircraft itself, but the mishap involves a fatality,
        reportable injury, or reportable property damage. A missile or UAV that is launched
        from a DOD aircraft, departs without damaging the aircraft, and is subsequently
        involved in a DOD mishap is reportable as a guided missile mishap or UAV mishap,
        respectively.
        1.6.1.3.3. Aircraft Ground Operations Mishap. A mishap involving DoD aircraft,
        with an aircrew member on board, that occurs between engine start/shutdown and
        prior to/following intent for flight that results in reportable property damage or any
        injury or fatality. Damage to a missile prior to the completion of weapons upload
        procedures, or after initiation of weapons download procedures is a Missile mishap.
        Note: The three key factors required to meet the AGO category are: Aircrew
        member on board, Engines running, and intention to become airborne at some point.
        1.6.1.3.4. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Any mishap involving a DOD UAV as
        defined in this instruction, but not involving a DOD aircraft. Damage to a DOD UAV,
        when it is being handled as cargo, is a ground and industrial, industrial aviation
        mishap.
     1.6.1.4. Guided Missile. An Air Force mishap involving guided missiles or unique
     missile support equipment. Missiles that are damaged or destroyed after launch from an
     aircraft, but cause no aircraft damage, will be classified as a guided missile mishap.
     1.6.1.5. Explosives and Chemical Agents. An Air Force mishap fitting one of the
     subcategories below.
12                        AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006

     mishaps occurring while loading and/or off-loading or receiving services at dockside and
     mishaps occurring up to the high water mark during amphibious or inshore warfare
     training operations. It applies also to all injuries to DOD personnel occurring on board,
     whether or not job-related. Fatalities and/or injuries occurring on board that result from
     shipyard, repair facility, or private contractor operations are not afloat mishaps.
     1.6.1.8. Motor Vehicle. An Air Force mishap involving the operation of a motorized land
     vehicle operated by Air Force personnel. An Air Force mishap involving the operation
     of a DOD-owned or leased motorized land vehicle by non-Air Force personnel while
     operationally controlled by a DOD component. Fatalities or injuries to pedestrians or
     bicyclists involving moving motor vehicles are included in this category. This category
     does not include ground and industrial mishaps such as injuries occurring while
     loading or unloading, mounting or dismounting a non-moving vehicle; cargo damaged
     by weather; damage to a properly parked DOD vehicle, unless caused by an operating
     DOD vehicle. Additionally, damage to an Air Force vehicle caused by objects
     thrown or propelled into it by weather or natural phenomena, or by fire when no
     collision occurred; or damage to an Air Force vehicle when it is being handled as cargo
     and not operating under its own power and is properly parked, are not categorized as

            1.6.1.10.10. Miscellaneous. On- or off-duty mishaps that do not fit into the
            industrial, sports and recreational subcategory. Also included in this subcategory are
            reportable mishaps occurring while using a commercial carrier such as a commercial
            bus, airplane, or taxicab.
     1.6.2. Multiple Occurrence Mishaps. Damaging occurrences that happen in logical
     succession are considered to occur in a single mishap and will result in a single safety
     investigation, unless there is clearly no possible initiating or sustaining relationship between
     occurrences. An emergency vehicle responding to a mishap that collides with another motor
     vehicle is a separate mishap. MAJCOM/SE should contact HQ USAF/SE for resolution of
     questions regarding whether occurrences constitute a single or separate mishaps.
     1.6.3. Mishaps Involving Multiple Categories. Occasionally mishaps have characteristics
     that fit two or more mishap categories. In these cases, for the purposes of reporting and
     data collection, use the mishap category hierarchy to select the one primary
     category/subcategory and up to two cross categories/subcategories that define the mishap
     under investigation. Paragraph 1.6. and Figure 1.1. depict the mishap category
     hierarchy. The category/subcategory appearing first in the hierarchy that describes the
     mishap under investigation is the primary mishap category/subcategory. Similar logic is used
     for selecting cross categories/subcategories. For example, an inadvertent release of a
     conventional weapon from an aircraft in flight that does not damage the aircraft would be
     categorized as an aviation, aircraft flight-related mishap with, explosives and chemical
     agents, explosives involvement. An inadvertent initiation and launch of an ejection seat
     during ground maintenance would be categorized as aviation, aircraft ground operations
     mishap with, explosives and chemical agents, explosives, ground and industrial, industrial
     aviation involvement. Lastly, the drop of a conventional weapon being loaded onto an
     aircraft that does not explode but injures personnel would be categorized as an aviation,
     aircraft ground operations mishaps with, explosives and chemical agents, explosives, ground
     and industrial, industrial weapons involvement.
Figure 1.1. Mishap Categories.
1.7. Non-USAF Mishaps. Paragraph 1.6. and Figure 1.1. are concerned with Air Force
mishaps and their categorization. However, periodically the Air Force investigates mishaps that
DO NOT fit the definition of an Air Force mishap. The Air Force generally investigates non-
USAF mishaps because of an existing agreement with the involved party or because it has
unique expertise, an interest in the mishap, and has agreed to lead an investigation. For example,
the Air Force, by way of an existing Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU), may have previously agreed to investigate any mishap involving the
equipment of a foreign nation occurring on US soil. Non-USAF mishap categories are defined
below and diagramed in Figure 1.2. For the purposes of reporting and data collection, select the
one category that best defines the mishap under investigation. NOTE: Non-USAF mishaps fall
into one of three categories while USAF mishaps fall into one of ten DOD categories previously
discussed in paragraph 1.6. and diagramed in Figure 1.1.
   1.7.1. Non-USAF Aviation. Aviation mishaps involving:
       1.7.1.1. A non-DOD aircraft or non-DOD UAV, regardless of the existence of intent
       for flight, that only results in damage to non-USAF equipment or injury to non-USAF
       personnel. An Air Force pilot who is uninjured during a successful ejection from a
       foreign-owned, single-seat fighter that is subsequently destroyed is categorized as a non-
       USAF aviation mishap since there was no damage to Air Force equipment or injury to
       Air Force personnel.
       1.7.1.2. A DOD aircraft or DOD UAV, regardless of the existence of intent for flight,
       resulting in damage or injury to the Air Force (paragraph 1.3.1.1.) and another DOD
       component is responsible for reporting. An Air Force person killed in an aircraft
       belonging to another DOD component, typically would be investigated and reported by
       the DOD component owning the aircraft. However, if the Air Force wrote its own
       limited report, usually to document and report the loss of life, it would be categorized
       as a non-USAF aviation mishap.
   1.7.2. Contractor. Instances where contractor operations on government property during the
   execution of a government contract result in significant damage to contractor-owned
   equipment or injury to contract employees but not reportable damage to DOD property or
   injury to DOD personnel.
   1.7.3. Other. Mishaps that do not fit into the non-USAF aviation or contractor categories.

1.8. Mishap and Event Classifications. Classify mishaps by total direct mishap cost and the
severity of injury/occupational illness. EXCEPTION: Classify Class D mishaps and Class E
events according to the definitions below. Calculate direct cost of a mishap IAW paragraph 1.9.
NOTE: Severity of injury/occupational illness, NOT injury/occupational cost, is used to classify
mishaps.
   1.8.1. Class A Mishap. A mishap resulting in one or more of the following:
       1.8.1.1. Direct mishap cost totaling $1,000,000 or more.
       1.8.1.2. A fatality or permanent total disability.
       1.8.1.3. Destruction of a DOD aircraft (Attachment 1). NOTE: A destroyed UAV is not
       a Class A mishap unless the criteria in paragraphs 1.8.1.1. or 1.8.1.2. are met.
   1.8.2. Class B Mishap. A mishap resulting in one or more of the following:
       1.8.2.1. Direct mishap cost totaling $200,000 or more but less than $1,000,000.
       1.8.2.2. A permanent partial disability.
       1.8.2.3. Inpatient hospitalization of three or more personnel. Do not count or include
       individuals hospitalized for observation, diagnostic, or administrative purposes that were
       treated and released.
   1.8.3. Class C Mishap. A mishap resulting in one or more of the following:
       1.8.3.1. Direct mishap cost totaling $20,000 or more but less than $200,000.
       1.8.3.2. Any injury or occupational illness or disease that causes loss of one or more
       days away from work beyond the day or shift it occurred. When determining if the
       mishap is a Lost Time Case, you must count the number of days the employee was unable
       to work as a result of the injury or illness, regardless of whether or not the person was
       scheduled to work on those days. Weekend days, holidays, vacation days, or other days
       off are included in the total number of days, if the employee would not have been able
       to work on those days. NOTE: Occurrences that result from voluntary participation in
       wellness and fitness programs, or recreational activities such as exercise class,
       racquetball, or baseball or injuries or illnesses resulting from an employee eating,
       drinking, or preparing food for personnel consumption will be reported as on or off-duty
       mishaps to comply with DODI 6055.7 Department of Defense mandates.
       1.8.3.3. An occupational injury or illness resulting in permanent change of job.
   1.8.4. Class D Mishap. Class D Mishap. Any nonfatal injury or occupational illness that
   does not meet the definition of Lost Time. These are cases where, because of injury or
   occupational illness, Air Force personnel only works partial days, restricted work or were
   transferred to another job, required medical treatment greater than first aid, lost of
   consciousness, or a significant injury or illness diagnosed by a physician or other licensed
   health care professional, even if it does not result in death, days away from work, restricted
   work or job transfer, medical treatment greater then first aid, or loss of consciousness.
   NOTE: Occurrences that result from voluntary participation in wellness and fitness
   programs, or recreational activities such as exercise class, racquetball, or baseball or
   injuries or illnesses resulting from an employee eating, drinking, or preparing food for
18                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


     personnel consumption will be reported to comply with DODI 6055.7 Department of Defense
     mandates.
        1.8.4.1. (DELETED).
        1.8.4.2. (DELETED).
     1.8.5. Class E Events. These occurrences do not meet reportable mishap classification
     criteria, but are deemed important to investigate/report for mishap prevention. Class E reports
     provide an expeditious way to disseminate valuable mishap prevention information.
        1.8.5.1. Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR) Events. Any air traffic or movement area
        hazardous occurrence that endangers the safety of an aircraft or UAV.
        1.8.5.2. High Accident Potential (HAP) Events. Any hazardous occurrence that has a
        high potential for becoming a mishap that does not fit the definition of a HATR.
        1.8.5.3. Wildlife Strike (BASH) Events. Any wildlife strike to an aircraft or UAV that
        does not meet Class A, B, or C mishap reporting criteria.
        1.8.5.4. Property Damage Events (Non Aviation). Mishaps that do not have an injury
        or illness and the direct cost is totaling $2,000 or more but less than $20,000.
        1.8.5.5. Other occurrences as directed in the discipline specific safety manuals
        (AFMAN91-22X)
1.9. Mishap Costs. It is DOD policy to determine the total direct mishap cost in order to
provide a factual basis for the allocation of resources in support of DOD mishap prevention
programs. Direct mishap costs ONLY include property damage costs (DOD and Non-DOD) and
environmental cleanup costs.
     1.9.1. Determining DOD Property Damage Costs. This includes damage to materiel and the
     cost of labor to repair the materiel.
        1.9.1.1. Field Level Repair.
            1.9.1.1.1. Material Cost. If an item is repairable locally by unit personnel, calculate
            the cost of the materials used to repair the item. When determining the cost of Class I
            ODS use the value of $100.00 per pound for the inadvertent release of Class I ODSs.
            1.9.1.1.2. DOD Labor Costs (DOD military and civilian personnel). Determine the
            number of hours of labor to repair the damaged materiel. Obtain the hourly rate from:
            http://afsafety.af.mil/, Labor Rates for Safety Reporting. The hourly rate is for DOD
            military and civilian personnel. Multiply the number of hours of labor expended by
            DOD personnel by the hourly rate.
            1.9.1.1.3. Contractor Repairs.
                1.9.1.1.3.1. No Warranty. Use the actual cost charged to the government for
                repairs performed by contractors.
                1.9.1.1.3.2. Warranty In Place. Costs to repair damage must be reported even if
                the Air Force is reimbursed or if the repair is accomplished under warranty.
                Contact the Single Manager (SM) to determine the damage costs as if no
                warranty or reimbursement existed.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                              19


     1.9.1.2. Depot Level Repair.
         1.9.1.2.1. Materiel. Obtain the exchange cost for each damaged stocklisted item from
         the Air Force Master Item Identification Data Base (D043A) or the SM. If the
         sum total of the exchange costs is equal to or greater than $1,000,000, obtain an
         estimated cost of repair based upon actual damage from the depot/repair facility.
         Report this estimated cost. If the sum total of the exchange costs is less than
         $1,000,000, report this cost. If the depot/repair facility can-not provide an estimated
         cost of repair based upon actual damage, use exchange cost from D043A or the
         SM. The Base Supply Representative has access to D043A
         1.9.1.2.2. Depot Labor Costs. Determine the number of hours of labor to repair the
         damaged materiel. Obtain the hourly rate from: http://afsafety.af.mil/, Labor Rates
         for Safety Reporting. The hourly rate is for depot level personnel. Multiply the
         number of hours of labor expended by depot personnel by the hourly rate.
         1.9.1.2.3. Contractor Repairs.
             1.9.1.2.3.1. No Warranty. Use the actual cost charged to the government for
             repairs performed by contractors.
             1.9.1.2.3.2. Warranty In Place. Costs to repair damage must be reported even if
             the Air Force is reimbursed or if the repair is accomplished under warranty.
             Contact the SM to determine the damage costs as if no warranty or
             reimbursement existed.
     1.9.1.3. Destroyed Assets.
         1.9.1.3.1. Determining destroyed aircraft/UAV cost. If the aircraft/UAV is
         destroyed, obtain flyaway cost from AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning
         Factors, Table A10-1, Unit Flyaway Costs. Table A10-1 is available at:
         http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/, AFI 65-503, Table A10-1 (utilize hyperlink). Get
         the unit flyaway cost and contact the SM to get the cost of all modifications done to
         the aircraft/UAV up to the mishap date. For aircraft and UAVs not listed, contact the
         appropriate SM for cost information. NOTE: An aircraft/UAV that is damaged but
         will not be repaired is not automatically a destroyed aircraft/UAV. In this case,
         calculate repair cost IAW 1.9.1.1. and 1.9.1.2.
         1.9.1.3.2. Other destroyed or lost assets with no item to exchange. Use the standard
         (unit) cost from D043A or the Single Manager (SM). The Base Supply
         Representative has access to D043A.
  1.9.2. Determining Costs to Non-DOD Property Damage. If Air Force operations result in
  damage of non-DOD property, calculate and report the damage cost. Determine non-DOD
  property damage costs using the following priority:
     1.9.2.1. Legal office claims officer's damage statement.
     1.9.2.2. Official estimates, such as from security police reports, civil police reports,
     and/or logistics readiness offices.
  1.9.3. Determining Environmental Clean-Up Costs. Obtain these costs from the local civil
  engineering environmental section. The end cost of this type of clean up may not be available
20                             AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


     inside the nominal 30 day investigation timeframe. Use the best estimate available at the
     time of the final message. Environmental clean up costs include costs for:
        1.9.3.1. Clean up.
        1.9.3.2. Environmental decontamination.
        1.9.3.3. Restoration of private and government property.
1.10. Mishap Injury and Occupational Illnesses. Report the type of person (1.10.1.) and the
severity of injury/occupational illness (1.10.2.).
     1.10.1. Type of person: rated officer, nonrated officer, enlisted, cadet, DOD civilian, DOD
     contractor, Foreign Nationals, or non-DOD civilian. NOTE: Foreign Nationals include
     military (rated or non-rated) officer, military enlisted, or civilian.
     1.10.2. Severity of injury or occupational illnesses: fatality, permanent total disability,
     permanent partial disability, lost time case, or no lost time case. (See Attachment 1 for
     definitions.) For lost time cases, also report the number of days hospitalized and the number of
     days of lost time beyond the days hospitalized. In cases when the actual number of days
     hospitalized or lost time is not known at the time the safety report is submitted, the best
     official estimates made by a competent medical authority will be used.
1.11. Recording Injuries and Occupational Illnesses. Use the OSHA Form 300, Log of
Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses, for recording injuries and occupational illnesses to civilian
and military personnel meeting Class A, B, C, or D criteria. See AFMAN 91-224, Chapter 6,
for specific guidance. Note. Use separate logs (OSHA 301) to record military and civilian
personnel. Contractor personnel who are supervised on a daily basis by Air Force personnel may
be required to record their own injuries/illness.
1.12. Obtaining and Using Health Information.
     1.12.1. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA). This act is
     implemented by DOD 6025.18-R, DOD Health Information Privacy Regulation. Mishap
     investigation and reporting requires acquisition of information from the medical community.
     1.12.2. Safety officials at all levels are responsible to establish a liaison with the local
     medical agencies to ensure an information flow has been established (paragraph 2.3.).
     Chapter 7, of DOD 6025.18-R, directive provides for release of information for safety
     related mishap investigation and reporting as required by laws and directives encompassing
     public health and safety.
     1.12.3. Safeguarding Protected Information. Disclosure rules are identified in Chapter
     8, DOD 6025.18-R.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                     21


                                             Chapter 2

                                       RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. General Information. The guidelines in this chapter establish investigating and reporting
responsibilities for Air Force mishaps and events.
2.1. (AFMC) General Information. Center and wing safety offices must be organized IAW
AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program. The center/wing chief of safety
must report directly to the center/wing commander. The individuals assigned to the center/wing
safety offices must be safety trained and must have safety as their primary duty. They must be in
a safety AFSC or safety civilian job series. Civilian safety personnel must not have additional
job series as part of their position description. Safety cannot be an additional duty for members
of the center/wing safety office. If the center/wing safety office is not organized in this fashion, it
is not a center/wing safety office. This guidance does not imply that a wing safety office is
required, however if a wing safety office exists, it must be organized IAW with published
guidance.
2.2. The Air Force Chief of Safety (HQ USAF/SE). The Air Force Chief of Safety (HQ
USAF/SE) will:
   2.2.1. Establish requirements and policies to ensure Air Force mishaps are reported and
   investigated IAW AFPD 91-2.
   2.2.2. Establish requirements and policies to ensure Air Force mishaps, events, and other
   information that may serve as mishap precursors are reported and investigated sufficiently to
   serve the needs of a robust mishap prevention program.
   2.2.3. Provide technical and investigative expertise to safety investigations as directed by this
   instruction.
   2.2.4. Establish policies and programs to validate the results of safety investigations and to
   manage Class A and B safety investigation recommendations to their appropriate
   conclusions. Determine whether to close recommendations or leave them open for future
   action.
   2.2.5. Maintain records of Air Force safety investigations as directed by Public Law and as
   necessary for Air Force mishap prevention purposes.
   2.2.6. Establish policies and procedures to release safety investigation information to
   agencies outside Air Force safety channels.
   2.2.7. Prepare a Memorandum of Final Evaluation (MOFE) on each formal report regardless
   of mishap class, and all Class A and B final message reports when the formal report is
   waived. Ensure MOFE is disseminated to MAJCOM/SEs.
   2.2.8. Develop joint/combined investigation policy/doctrine in coordination with other
   services/nations.
2.3. The Air Force Surgeon General (AF/SG). The Air Force Surgeon General (AF/SG) will
ensure medical personnel provide medical related information, relevant to the investigation, to
safety investigators to support the Air Force mishap and investigation process.
22                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


2.4. MAJCOM Commanders. MAJCOM Commanders will:
(NOTE: For purposes of this instruction, the term "MAJCOM" includes ANG, DRUs, and
FOAs).
     2.4.1. Establish policy and procedures to ensure mishaps assigned under the provisions
     of this instruction are properly investigated and reported.
     2.4.2. Establish policies and programs to validate the results of safety investigations and
     track safety investigation recommendations to their appropriate conclusions.
     2.4.3. Ensure action is taken on all open recommendations on which the command is
     the action agency.
     2.4.4. Ensure all appropriate agencies and organizations within their command review each
     MOFE, to determine whether any of the deficiencies leading to the mishap apply to their
     commands.
     2.4.5. Ensure all mishaps that occur when operations of government contractors result in
     reportable damage or injury to the Air Force (paragraph 1.3.1.1.), even if the government
     is wholly or partially repaid, are investigated and reported according to this instruction, AFI
     10-220(I), Contractor's Flight and Ground Operations, and AFPAM 91-210, Contract
     Safety. This includes non-accepted equipment (non-delivered equipment for which the
     Government has assumed responsibility; DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving
     Report, HAS NOT been executed).
     2.4.5. (AFMC) The Air Force generally assumes responsibility for aircraft/UAVs when
     they leave the production facility (DD Form 250 HAS NOT been executed) as
     described in the DFAR 252.228-7001, Ground and Flight Risk and/or the DFAR 252.228-
     7002, Aircraft Flight Risk. When operations of government contractors result in a mishap
     involving an aircraft/UAV or other product built, designed, maintained, or modified by a
     government contractor and the Air Force has assumed responsibility for the aircraft/UAV
     or other product, the mishap will be investigated and reported IAW AFI 91-204, AFI 10-
     220(I), Contractor’s Flight and Ground Safety, and AFPAM 91-210, Contract Safety.
        2.4.5.1. (Added-AFMC) For Class A and B mishaps involving contracts managed by
        DCMA, a safety trained DCMA representative may be assigned to the SIB as an
        observer (paragraph 5.4.4.). NOTE: To be safety trained, the DCMA representative
        must be a graduate of the Flight Safety Officer (FSO) Course, Aircraft Mishap
        Investigation Course (AMIC), Mishap Investigation Non-Aviation (MINA) Course,
        AETC Jet Engine Mishap Investigation Course (JEMIC), or OSHA Advanced Accident
        Investigation Course.
        2.4.5.2. (Added-AFMC) For Class C and below mishaps involving contract managed by
        DCMA, a safety trained DCMA representative (see NOTE in paragraph 2.4.5.1.
        (Added)) may oversee the investigation at the contractor facility. The DCMA
        representative will forward the results of the investigation to the Cognizant Service
        Safety Official (CSSO). The CSSO is usually part of the safety office for the center that
        administers the contract. The CSSO will report the mishap through AFSAS.
        2.4.5.3. (Added-AFMC) Contractors are required to investigate and report mishaps
        occurring on their production facility where the government has not assumed
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                              23


      responsibility (Ground and Flight Risk Clause does not apply) as Quality Assessment
      Reports (QAR). The DCMA representative will forward applicable QARs to the CSSO.
      QARs should be reviewed by the SPM for applicability to Air Force actions/processes.
   2.4.6. Ensure government contracts/lease agreements determine convening authority prior to
   executing the contract/lease agreement.
      2.4.6.1. The contract/lease agreement will ensure:
          2.4.6.1.1. The contractor will notify the Air Force and the contract management
          authority when reportable damage or injury to the Air Force (paragraph 1.3.1.1.)
          occurs.
          2.4.6.1.2. The contractor will support and comply with the safety investigation
          and report requirements of this instruction.
          2.4.6.1.3. A record of all mishaps involving Air Force resources will be entered into
          the Air Force safety reporting system. This record includes required safety reports
          submitted IAW this instruction.
          2.4.6.1.4. A record of mishaps involving other DOD resources will be forwarded
          to the involved agencies with an information copy to HQ USAF/SE. This record
          includes all mishap information.
          2.4.6.1.5. When a mishap involves a contract managed by the Defense Contract
          Management Agency (DCMA), DCMA safety personnel will review the final
          message safety report and send their response back to HQ AFSC (paragraph 7.2.
          and 7.2.3.).
          2.4.6.1.6. The contract discusses toxicology testing in the event of an Air Force
          mishap.
      2.4.6.2. Ensure contract/lease agreements for aerospace vehicles state: The Air Force is

  deemed necessary. Accomplish promptly and IAW applicable directives (AFI 44-120,
  Drug Abuse Testing Program, for military personnel and The Air Force Civilian Drug
  Testing Plan for civilian personnel). The Air Force Civilian Drug Testing Plan is available
  from the civilian personnel office.
     2.7.5.1. Military Members. For all classes and categories of mishaps, commanders have
     the discretion to test involved military members whose actions or inactions, in their
     judgment, may have been factors in the mishap sequence. However, for all Class A and B
     aviation mishaps, commanders must test all military crewmembers on the flight orders
     (includes UAV controllers). Because the evidence is perishable, commanders should test
     all military crewmembers on the flight orders (includes UAV controllers) for aviation
     mishaps that have the potential of meeting the Class B threshold.
     2.7.5.2. DOD Civilians. DOD civilians will be subject to testing when their action or
     inaction may have contributed to the mishap subject to the limitations and guidance in The
     Air Force Civilian Drug Testing Plan.
     2.7.5.3. Government Contract Employees. Government Contract Employees (includes
     UAV controllers) will be tested IAW the terms and conditions of the applicable contract
     or if they consent, when their actions or inaction in the commander's judgment may have
     been a factor in the mishap sequence.
     2.7.5.4. Blood testing is superior and the preferred method for all categories of safety
     investigations over urine testing since it provides an opportunity to determine the
     concentration of the substance and thus the expected performance decrement. Also, not
     all substances are excreted in the urine. Blood will be used for toxicological testing of
     military members for aviation safety investigations and is the preferred method for all
     safety investigations. Coordinate with the Civilian Personnel Office or Contracting
     Officer before requiring blood samples from DOD civilian or contractor employees.
     All blood samples will be sent to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP). Rely
     on chain of custody procedures in AFI 44-120 or The Air Force Civilian Drug Testing
     Plan in order to ensure sample testing accuracy. Toxicological analyses should be
     directed toward controlled substances, as well as any medications, as indicated by the
     medical history and environmental substances (such as carbon monoxide) as indicated by
     the nature of the mishap or event.
  2.7.6. Make the Appropriate Military Notifications:
     2.7.6.1. Inform the public affairs (PA) officer of non-privileged information. Release

                                               Chapter 3

                           PRIVILEGED SAFETY INFORMATION

3.1. General Information. All safety reports contain privileged safety information, but not all
information in a safety report is privileged. EXCEPTION: The preliminary message, HATRs,
Wildlife Strike Reports, and non-DOD aviation safety reports do not contain privileged safety
information. Also ground and industrial, and explosive and chemical agents safety reports
regarding mishaps that occurred before 3 Oct 00 do not contain privileged safety information
(paragraph 3.4.). This chapter identifies privileged safety information and directs how to
handle it. This chapter also describes the promise of confidentiality and states how to use it
during an investigation. Finally, this chapter states how privileged safety reports and privileged
safety information can be used after a safety report is completed.
3.1. (AFMC) General Information. DB10, just as in AFSAS, will not contain classified
information. When information from DB10 is printed, each page will be appropriately marked
IAW AFI 91-204, paragraph 3.2.6. When transmitting information from DB10, it will be
done IAW AFI 91-204, paragraph 3.2.7.
3.2. Identifying and Handling Privileged Safety Information. Privileged safety information
refers to information that is exempt by statute or case law from disclosure outside the Air Force
safety community. The military safety privilege is judicially recognized and protects the
investigative process. The Air Force treats this information confidentially to ensure commanders
quickly obtain accurate mishap information thereby promoting safety, combat readiness, and
mission accomplishment. NOTE: Safety investigations of non-DOD aviation mishaps are
conducted using this instruction as guidance and do not contain privileged safety information.
     3.2.1. Privileged information includes:
        3.2.1.1. Findings, conclusions, causes, recommendations, analysis, and the deliberative
        process of all safety investigators. Diagrams and exhibits if they contain information
        which depicts the analysis of safety investigators. This includes draft versions of the
        above materiel.
        3.2.1.2. Information given to safety investigators pursuant to a promise of
        confidentiality (paragraph 3.2.5.).
        3.2.1.3. Computer generated videotape animations, simulations, or simulator
        reenactments in which safety investigator analysis is incorporated. Animations made
        exclusively from recorder data (including Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance
        (MFOQA) data) are not privileged.
        3.2.1.4. Photographs, films, and videotapes, which are staged, reconstructed, or
        simulated reenactments of possible or probable scenarios developed by or for the analysis
        of the safety investigator.
        3.2.1.5. Any Life Science Materiel, including photographs with markings or other
        indicators that contain analysis by a safety investigator. For example, 72-hour
        histories, 14-day histories, and interview narratives obtained during the post-mishap
        physical examination.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                33


  3.2.2. Prohibited Uses of Privileged Safety Reports and Information. These prohibitions
  apply to Part 2 of formal safety reports, status and final safety messages, and any other
  reports or documents containing privileged safety information.
     3.2.2.1. Air Force employees, military members, and government contractors, will not
     wrongfully use, permit the use of, gain access to, or allow access to the privileged
     information in any safety report, or portions thereof, for other than officially authorized
     mishap prevention purposes.
     3.2.2.2. Violations of the prohibitions in paragraphs 3.1. through paragraph 3.4. of this
     instruction are punishable under Article 92(1), UCMJ and may be grounds for
     disciplinary actions according to civilian personnel regulations, or may lead to contract
     actions.
     3.2.2.3. The Air Force does not use privileged safety information as evidence for
     punitive, disciplinary, or adverse administrative actions, for determining the misconduct
     or line-of-duty status of any person, in flying evaluation board hearings or reviews, to
     determine liability or liability in claims for or against the United States, or in any
     other manner in any action by or against the United States.
  3.2.3. Controlling and Handling Privileged Safety Reports and Information. Personnel
  having access (authorized access or unauthorized access) to privileged safety reports and
  information have a duty to control the reports to prevent their use for anything other than
  mishap prevention. When these reports and information are no longer needed for mishap
  prevention purposes, dispose of IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
  located at https://webrims.amc.af.mil.
  3.2.4. Privileged Safety Information and Safety Reports. Safety reports are for official
  use only (FOUO) if they are not classified. However, not each document in the report is
  FOUO. The factual documents in Part 1 of formal safety reports are not considered FOUO
  by this AFI, and should not be marked as such. However, documents from other sources
  included in Part 1 may already be marked FOUO. Only the OPR for the document may
  remove FOUO markings.
  3.2.5. Promise of Confidentiality.
     3.2.5.1. Purpose. The Air Force gives a promise of confidentiality to encourage frank
     and open communications with individuals who provide witness statements (to a safety
     investigator) and with government contractors, who built, designed, or maintained the
     equipment and participate in the safety investigation. However, if an individual provides a
     false statement to a safety investigator under a promise of confidentiality, that statement
     (and any other information that witness gave to the safety investigator) loses its privileged
     status and can be used to support disciplinary and/or adverse administrative actions.
     3.2.5.2. Promises of Confidentiality Authorized. Promises of confidentiality are only
     authorized in investigations of Air Force nuclear, space, aviation, guided missile, and
     directed energy mishaps. However, there may be occasions, such as mishaps
     involving complex systems, military-unique items (such as armored vehicles), or
     military-unique operations or exercises, where a witness or involved contractor will not
     provide a statement or information without a promise of confidentiality. When this
34                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


        appears to be the case, contact HQ USAF/SE for approval to grant confidentiality to that
        (those) witness(es).
        3.2.5.3. Promises of Confidentiality Not Authorized. Promises of confidentiality are
        not authorized for explosives and chemical agents, afloat, motor vehicle, off-duty
        military, and ground and industrial mishaps (see the exception for complex systems,
        military-unique items, or military-unique operations or exercises in paragraph
        3.2.5.2.). Promises of confidentiality are also not authorized for HATRs.
        3.2.5.4. Persons Authorized to Make Promises of Confidentiality. Only members of a
        designated ISB/SIB (or a SIO) may offer promises of confidentiality and only during
        safety investigations where promises of confidentiality are authorized. When conducting
        safety investigations in which promises of confidentiality are authorized, the safety
        investigators have the discretion to decide who will be offered a promise of
        confidentiality. The investigators‘ decision should be based upon a witness or contractor‘s
        reluctance to cooperate, involvement in the mishap sequence, or apparent self-interest in
        not disclosing information. Promises of confidentiality will only be given as needed
        to ensure forthright cooperation of the witness and may not be given on a blanket basis to
        all witnesses.
        3.2.5.5. Persons to Whom Promises of Confidentiality May be Offered. Promises of
        confidentiality may be offered to any witness and contractors who built, designed or
        maintained the equipment in order to encourage their full cooperation and candid
        statements.
        3.2.5.6. Non-privileged Witness Statements. If witnesses provide a statement without a
        promise of confidentiality, ensure they are informed that their statement will be provided
        to the legal investigation (if applicable) and/or may be released to the public pursuant to a
        Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.
     3.2.6. Marking and Documenting Safety Information.
        3.2.6.1. The cover and individual pages of documents containing privileged information
        will be clearly marked with the warning statement (FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY) in
        Figure A3.1. All media containing privileged information (audiotapes, videotapes,
        animations, simulations, computer generated profiles, etc.) will be clearly marked with
        the warning statement in Figure A3.1. See paragraph 3.2.7. for further information on
        email. Part 1 (Factual Information and Releasable Material) of a formal report will not be
        marked with the warning statement in Figure A3.1.
        3.2.6.2. Promises of Confidentiality. If a promise of confidentiality is offered and
        accepted, it must be documented. Use the sample witness statement format in Figure
        A3.2. for written statements. Read, record, and transcribe the statement in Figure A3.3.
        for recorded interviews of witnesses. Use Figure A3.6. to document that contractor
        personnel (those personnel not serving as technical experts to a SIB) acknowledge and
        understand the limitations on the use of privileged safety information and media. Use
        Figure A3.7. to document promises of confidentiality to contractor representatives
        serving as technical experts for a SIB. Use Figure A3.8. as a cover sheet for confidential
        technical reports and analysis provided by contractors.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                 35


       3.2.6.3. Non-privileged Witness Statements. If witnesses or contractors provide a
       statement without a promise of confidentiality, it must be documented by using the sample
       witness statement format in Figure A3.4. for written statements. Read, record, and
       transcribe the statement in Figure A3.5. for recorded interviews.
       3.2.6.4. For all written witness statements (privileged and non-privileged) reproduced
       for other government agencies/bodies (e.g., the legal board), ensure the appropriate
       signed, dated memorandum (Figure A3.2. or Figure A3.4.) from Attachment 3 is
       included as the first page of the reproduced statement.
   3.2.7. Transmitting Safety Information.
       3.2.7.1. To protect the privileged status and to ensure the correct handling of safety
       reports, originating organizations will use the Air Force Safety Automated System
       (AFSAS) reporting system to transmit messages. AFSAS is a user ID and password
       system ensuring the protection of privileged information. If AFSAS is not available
       (paragraph 6.1.) use DMS and the addressing requirements of this instruction. All
       DMS safety messages containing privileged safety information or Privacy Act
       information must be digitally signed and encrypted
       3.2.7.2. If AFSAS and DMS are not available, or not practical, use one of the following
       ways to send privileged safety reports and information:
           3.2.7.2.1. Password protect the privileged safety report or information and then email
           the document. Send the applicable password in a separate message or by another
           mode of transmission.
           3.2.7.2.2. Fax the document ensuring that the recipient will receive the faxed
           document immediately upon receipt.
           3.2.7.2.3. Intrabase. This includes wide area networks or local area networks served
           by a single network control center. The transmitting and receiving units will use
           appropriate limited-use, Privacy Act, and FOUO markings as required and may be
           transmitted unencoded and unencrypted.
3.3. Authorized Use and Release of Privileged Safety Reports and Information. In ord er t o
h elp ensure courts honor the assertion of privilege, the rules described in this paragraph must be
followed. The Air Force ensures privileged safety reports and information are used only by
persons and agencies whose duties include relevant mishap prevention responsibilities
(paragraphs 3.3.2. and 3.3.3.). All personnel and agencies authorized access to privileged
safety reports and information will follow the policy in paragraphs 3.2.2. and 3.2.3. Only HQ
USAF/SE approves release of privileged safety information outside the Air Force, even to
members of Congress or officials of the Department of Justice. Unique circumstances described
in paragraphs below allow certain authorized individuals to release privileged information
outside the Air Force. Privileged safety information remains Air Force property. Questions
regarding access to privileged safety information should be referred to HQ AFSC/JA. Access is
limited to information that is necessary for and consistent with mishap prevention.
Whenever privileged safety information is requested, first determine whether or not mishap
prevention goals can be met by sanitizing the information (paragraph 3.3.1.). If the answer is
no, then provide only the necessary information to the authorized persons or agencies with the
restrictive markings affixed.
36                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


     3.3.1. Sanitizing Privileged Safety Reports. Sanitizing reports or extracts from reports means
     obscuring the relationship between the identity of a mishap and the findings, conclusions,
     causes, recommendations, deliberative processes resulting from the investigation, and
     statements made under a promise of confidentiality. Wing safety officers or their designated
     representatives (that are properly trained) may sanitize privileged safety reports and other
     media for unit use and for use by authorized contractor personnel. Some mishaps, because
     of widespread publicity or unique circumstances, cannot be fully sanitized. When a report is
     sanitized, the findings, causes, recommendation, conclusions, or opinions of the investigation
     are no longer privileged. (Note: Sanitized reports are not necessarily releasable to the public
     since they may still contain information protected by the Privacy Act, Arms Export
     Control Act, or Export Administration Act. Ensure sanitized reports are appropriately
     labeled.) Sanitizing a report involves separating the following identifying information
     from related safety investigator findings, causes, recommendations, conclusions, or opinions:
        3.3.1.1. Date and place of the mishap.
        3.3.1.2. Aircraft, UAV, missile, vehicle, or weapon serial number.
        3.3.1.3. Names and social security numbers (SSN), if included, of persons involved.
        3.3.1.4. Any other detail identifying the mishap.
        3.3.1.5. Remove identifying information and markings identifying the documents as
        privileged or FOUO before reproducing sanitized reports or extracts of reports.
        3.3.1.6. Do not release statements or contractor reports obtained with a promise of
        confidentiality.
     3.3.2. Limiting Use or Release within the Air Force. Safety officers and their staffs, duly
     appointed safety investigators, AFSC personnel and AF/SE and his staff, are authorized
     access to and use of privileged safety information based on their safety duties. Other Air
     Force officials, when their duties include mishap prevention and when it is necessary to
     develop, take, or review preventive actions, may obtain access to privileged safety
     information. See paragraphs 3.2.2., 3.2.3., and 3.3. MAJCOM, NAF/Center or unit Chiefs
     of Safety are authorized, when sanitized information is inadequate, to provide privileged
     safety information as lessons learned to Air Force members on a need-to-know basis and
     solely for mishap prevention. They will ensure members are instructed on properly
     protecting information and their responsibilities to prevent further, unauthorized release.
     Lessons learned will not include confidential statements or contractor reports.
        3.3.2.1. AF/SE; AFSC/CD and division chiefs; MAJCOM, NAF/Center or unit Chiefs of
        Safety; SIB presidents or SIOs; are authorized to disclose privileged safety information to
        AF officials as described in 3.3.2.
        3.3.2.2. AIB investigators, with a safety need to know, (e.g., pilots, commanders,
        operations personnel) may have access to privileged safety information from the
        corresponding safety investigation, only after final approval of the AIB report. AIB
        investigators must first coordinate with the convening authority JA and SE if the AIB
        report has not been released to the public. The convening authority will determine if
        access is appropriate before next-of-kin are briefed following a fatal mishap.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                               37


     3.3.2.3. Part 1 of the two-part formal safety report and certain factual information is
     given to the legal board president (paragraph 5.14. and the discipline specific safety
     manual AFMAN 91-22X).
     3.3.2.4. (DELETED).
     3.3.2.5. Other Air Force officials such as the SJA (other than HQ AFSC/JA), criminal
     investigative agencies such as the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI),
     Security Police, Historian (HO), and PA do not normally receive privileged safety
     information because of possible conflicts of interest and because use of such information
     by such officials would not be for mishap prevention purposes.
     3.3.2.6. ANG Personnel. Apply the test for releasing privileged safety information
     that is described in paragraph 3.3. Do not withhold privileged safety reports from
     ANG personnel who have a need to know when sanitized information is not adequate to
     develop, take, or review corrective action. Person having a need to know include, but are
     not limited to, those involved in mishap; whose duties included the preparation dispatch,
     or internal distribution of safety reports; and those who act in response to mishap
     prevention recommendations. Releasing information under this paragraph does not
     constitute release outside the Air Force.
  3.3.3. Limiting Release Outside the Air Force. In certain cases, the Air Force has agreed to
  exchange privileged safety information with other DOD agencies solely for mishap
  prevention purposes. Also, the Air Force shares certain mishap prevention information with
  other entities in the interests of the general safety community. See paragraphs 3.2.2., 3.2.3.,
  and 3.3.
     3.3.3.1. Responding to Subpoenas and Legal Process. Upon receipt of a legal process
     requiring participation in a court proceeding, including depositions and requests for
     production of documents, contact HQ AFSC/JA and the nearest Air Force base legal
     office. Fax a copy of the legal process to AFLSA/JACT. Encourage requesters to ask the
     MAJCOM/JA for the AFI 51-503 accident report if one has been prepared.
     3.3.3.2. Responding to FOIA Requests. FOIA requests under Title 5, United States Code,
     section 552 (5 U.S.C. 552). Send requests to HQ AFSC/JA.
     3.3.3.3. Historical Safety Reports. HQ USAF/SE/SED may release the findings of a
     Safety Board, contained in historical safety reports prepared IAW DODI 6055.7 (or its
     predecessors), provided no national defense or safety interest exists. For the purpose of
     this provision, historical reports shall be defined as those concerning mishaps more
     than 25 years old. (Note: Safety Reports on pre-1956 mishaps are not protected by
     the safety privilege and are stored at the Air Force Historical Research Agency,
     Maxwell AFB.)
     3.3.3.4. Safety Reports Where a Promise of Confidentiality is Not Authorized IAW
     DODI 6055.7, paragraph E4.5.3.3.1. HQ USAF/SE/SED is designated by the Secretary
     of the Air Force to assert the privilege to oppose any court-ordered release of privileged
     safety information for all investigations where promises of confidentiality are not
     authorized. Further, upon determination by HQ USAF/SE/SED that no safety or
     national defense interest is jeopardized, HQ USAF/SE/ SED may authorize the release
38                        AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


     of safety investigation findings. See paragraph 3.2.5.3. for investigations where safety
     investigators are not authorized to grant promises of confidentiality.
     3.3.3.5. Limiting Release to Contractors. Contractors may need access to privileged
     safety information when they are performing an Air Force function involving mishap
     prevention. Contractors may also need access to privileged safety information if they
     designed, built, maintained or operated Air Force weapon systems, their components, or
     other Air Force equipment, in order to correct defects or other problems and help
     prevent future mishaps. When contractors need access to privileged safety information,
     the appropriate memorandum in Figure A3.6. or Figure A3.7. must be used and kept on
     file with the individual authorizing access to the information. Access will be limited to
     what is needed to prevent future mishaps. Contractors will not release the information
     outside contractor safety channels; for example, privileged safety information will not be
     released to the general counsel‘s office or public relations personnel. The number of
     contractor employees who have access to the information shall be strictly limited to only
     those individuals who have a need to know the information in order to enhance the
     safety of the Air Force weapon systems. After a project is complete, contractors will not
     maintain the information in their files. Contractors must understand and agree to their
     responsibilities to treat such information as confidential. See paragraphs 3.2.2., 3.2.3.,
     and 3.3.
        3.3.3.5.1. Contractors who built, designed, or maintained equipment involved in
        mishaps send representatives to support Air Force SIBs at the request of the Air
        Force. SIB presidents and safety investigators will ensure those representatives
        understand that the Air Force may, at the contractor‘s request, extend a claim of
        privilege over documents provided by the contractor representatives to the SIB when
        the Air Force maintains sole possession or control. A claim of privilege may not be
        sustained over notes, documents, and other matter produced during the SIB
        investigation by the contractor but retained by the contractor representatives. SIB
        presidents grant these contractors access to privileged safety information only if it
        is essential to assist the SIB.
        3.3.3.5.2. Contractors providing weapon system maintenance support are
        performing an Air Force function. Advise them that disclosure of privileged safety
        information is necessary for fulfillment of contractual obligations. The wing chief of
        safety, MAJCOM/SE, or HQ AFSC may provide the contractors safety information
        for this function.
        3.3.3.5.3. Air Force operations conducted at contractors‘ facilities require
        privileged safety information handling.
        3.3.3.5.4. Contractors providing weapon system crew training are performing an
        Air Force function, and need information from safety reports, videos, and other
        similar media to build training scenarios. The wing chief of safety, MAJCOM/SE,
        or HQ AFSC may provide the contractors safety reports for this function.
        3.3.3.5.5. Contractors who instruct safety programs in mishap investigation or safety
        program management contracted by the Air Force or ARC require access to
        privileged safety information. The wing chief of safety, MAJCOM/SE, or HQ AFSC
        may provide the contractors safety reports for this function.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                             39


        3.3.3.5.6. Contractors who build, design, maintain, or operate Air Force weapon
        systems, their components, or other Air Force equipment may need privileged
        safety information to correct defects or other problems and prevent future mishaps.
        The wing chief of safety, MAJCOM/SE, System Program Office safety officer or
        equivalent, or HQ USAF/SE/SED may provide contractors privileged safety
        information for this function. This includes Space System Contractors, Space
        Technical Support Contractors, Advisory & Assistance Services (A&AS), and
        Federally Funded Research & Development Centers (FFRDC) when they are
        performing an Air Force function.
        3.3.3.5.7. Any other release of privileged safety information to contractors will
        first be approved by HQ USAF/SE/SED.
     3.3.3.6. Limiting Release to Other Services and DOD Agencies. Other US military
     services and DOD agencies responsible for flying, supporting or maintaining Air Force
     aircraft may receive privileged safety information when needed for mishap prevention.
     Joint project or program offices may share privileged safety information with members
     of other DOD agencies working on the same project or program without prior approval.
     Approval authority for exchanging formal safety reports with other military services is
     HQ USAF/SE/SED or HQ AFSC/JA.
     3.3.3.7. Limiting Release to Foreign Military Organizations. All agreements regarding the
     release of safety information to foreign military organizations are subject to the
     limitations and guidance found in DoDI 6055.7. Release of safety information to NATO
     military organizations is governed by NATO STANAGs 3101, Exchange of Safety
     Information Concerning Aircraft and Missiles, and 3531, Safety Investigation and
     Reporting of Accidents/Incidents Involving Military Aircraft and/or Missiles. Many
     other foreign military organizations have MOAs/MOUs with HQ USAF/ SE discussing
     the release of safety information.
        3.3.3.7.1. Foreign Nationals Flying USAF Aircraft or Participating in USAF
        Training. Release of safety information to foreign nationals is governed by DoDI
        6055.7. Note that foreign national military personnel assigned to the DoD
        Components are defined as DoD military personnel by DoDI 6055.7.
     3.3.3.8. Limiting Release of Nuclear Safety Reports to Agencies outside the Air
     Force. HQ USAF/SE may approve the release of extracts of nuclear safety reports to US
     governmental agencies with statutory jurisdiction, such as the Defense Threat Reduction
     Agency (DTRA); and operations offices or authorized contractors of the Department of
     Energy. The MAJCOM commander may provide DULL SWORD reports about weapons
     and common equipment deficiencies to the unified commander as deemed appropriate
     and necessary for the theater commander to accomplish his or her role in nuclear surety.
     Send this information by inclusion of the appropriate unified command address in the
     message report as provided by the MAJCOM supplement to this instruction. The unified
     commander ensures the information is treated as privileged information and not released
     or distributed outside the respective headquarters without first obtaining permission from
     HQ USAF/SE. The Air Force releases this information only to reach its nuclear surety
     goals.
40                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


        3.3.3.9. Limiting Release to NTSB and FAA. AFJI 91-206, Participation in a Military
        or Civil Aircraft Accident Safety Investigation governs the release of safety information
        to the NTSB and FAA for aviation mishaps. For other mishaps, use AFJI 91-206 as a
        guide.
        3.3.3.10. Limiting Release to NASA and National Reconnaissance Office (NRO).
        Applicable space safety reports will be distributed to NASA and NRO upon completion.
3.4. Handling and Disclosing Reports on Ground and Industrial, and Explosives and
Chemical Agents Mishaps that occurred before 3 Oct 00.
     3.4.1. The purpose of these reports is mishap prevention. The reports were normally
     considered general-use reports in that witnesses were not promised confidentiality, and the
     reports were not considered privileged. However, they are FOUO and are handled according
     to DODI 5400.7-R/AF Supplement, DOD Freedom Of Information Act Program.
     3.4.2. Do not disclose the identities of involved personnel in educational or promotional
     materiels.
     3.4.3. These reports can be released outside the Air Force safety community and outside
     the Air Force once protected information, including Privacy Act information, findings, and
     recommendations are removed. The installation chief of safety is the release authority for
     providing these reports to other Air Force personnel. The reports may not be used for any
     purpose other than mishap prevention, with the exception that the complete report may be
     released to Air Force claims personnel to assist them in evaluating claims for damages filed
     against the Air Force. When release will be made outside the Air Force, HQ AFSC/JA is the
     release authority.
     3.4.4. To control reports retain only one copy of each safety report at wing or base,
     intermediate command, and MAJCOM safety offices. Air Force and unified command
     agencies may view these reports for official purposes, but they do not release copies
     without approval of the appropriate disclosure authority. Advise personnel viewing these
     reports that findings of cause, conclusions, recommendations, corrective actions, and
     witness statements taken by safety investigators in the course of the investigation are
     used primarily for mishap prevention purposes. (AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and
     Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH) Program, provides guidance on
     the Air Force relationship with OSHA.) Refer all requests for release to HQ AFSC/JA.
     3.4.5. Upon written request, HQ AFSC/JA provides the releasable portions of ground and
     explosive safety reports to the requester.

                                             Chapter 4

                   DETERMINING INVESTIGATIVE RESPONSIBILITY

4.1. General Information. The Air Force generally assigns mishap investigative
responsibilities to the command (MAJCOM) that experienced the loss of an owned asset
(property). The command (MAJCOM) with investigative responsibility may or may not have
Operation Control (OPCON) over the asset (property). In some cases, mishaps may involve
assets or individuals from multiple agencies. Follow the guidance in this chapter to determine
investigative responsibility.
4.2. Convening Authority Determination. The convening authority is the individual who
has the authority to order a safety investigation. The MAJCOM/CC of the organization that owns
the asset is considered to be the convening authority unless: HQ USAF/SE assumes investigative
responsibility, another MAJCOM/CC assumes investigative responsibility (with the concurrence
of the owning organization and HQ USAF/SE), or investigative responsibility is delegated to a
lower level of command.
   4.2.1. For all on-duty Class A, all nuclear Class A, and all NUCFLASH or BROKEN
   ARROW mishaps, the MAJCOM/CC is the convening authority. This authority will not be
   delegated to a subordinate commander. EXCEPTION: ARC Class A mishaps that are not
   aviation mishaps (paragraph 4.5.)
   4.2.2. For all other mishaps and events, convening authority may be delegated to an
   appropriate level of command.
   4.2.2. (AFMC) The applicable center commander is the convening authority for Class B,
   C, and D mishaps, and Class E events unless assumed by the AFMC/CC. The center
   commander may delegate convening authority for Class C and D mishaps, and Class E events
   to the applicable wing commander provided they have a wing safety office established IAW
   paragraph 2.1. For the 377 ABW and the 311 HSW the applicable wing commander is the
   convening authority for Class B, C, and D mishaps, and Class E events unless assumed by
   AFMC/CC.
4.3. Mishaps Involving Multiple Commands. Involved MAJCOM/CCs will determine
which command will assume investigative responsibility and advise HQ USAF/SE within 24
hours. In general, the command whose asset initiated the mishap will assume investigative
responsibility. If mishap initiation is initially unclear, the command sustaining the highest level of
loss in the mishap will assume investigative responsibility. MAJCOM/CC may determine other
compelling reasons exist for assigning investigative responsibility differently. If MAJCOMs
cannot reach agreement, HQ USAF/SE will determine mishap investigation responsibility.
4.3. (AFMC) Mishaps Involving Multiple Commands. AFMC's test operations often warrant
modified safety investigative responsibility rules due to varying aircraft possession, mixed
command crews, or other reasons. In these instances, MOAs with other MAJCOMs (with HQ
USAF/SE concurrence), will outline mishap investigation responsibility. HQ AFMC/SE is the
coordinating OPR for MOAs related to mishap investigation responsibility. HQ AFMC/DOO is
the coordinating OPR for all MOAs related to aircraft possession, assignment, and loans.
42                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


4.4. Mishaps Involving Multiple Services. For a multi-service or joint operational mishap,
activate Memorandum of Understanding Among the US Army, Air Force and Naval Safety
Centers, Headquarters Marine Corps (Safety Division) and the US Coast Guard Health and
Safety Directorate for Safety Investigation and Reporting of Joint Service Mishaps.
MAJCOM/SE should contact HQ USAF/SE if there are questions.
4.5. Mishaps Involving Air Reserve Component Assets. The convening authority for all ARC
Class A aviation mishaps is the gaining MAJCOM/CC. For all other mishaps and events,
convening authority is determined by the AFRC/CC or NGB/CF as applicable.
4.6. Mishaps Involving NATO Systems or Personnel. Investigate and report mishaps
involving Air Force aircraft, space vehicles, or missiles according to this instruction. Comply
with NATO STANAG 3102, Flight Safety Co-operation in Common Ground/Air Space, 3318,
Aeromedical Aspects of Aircraft Accident/Incident Investigation, 3531, Safety Investigation and
Reporting of Accidents/Incidents Involving Military Aircraft and/or Missiles, and Air Standard
85/02A, Investigation of Aircraft/Missile Accidents/Incidents. The investigation required
under STANAG 3531 is in addition to, and conducted separately from, the investigation
required by this instruction.
4.7. Mishaps Involving Non-NATO Foreign Military Equipment or Personnel in
CONUS. I t i s desirable to conduct only one safety investigation that has the full support and
participation of all involved nations. However, separate investigations are authorized if necessary
due to law, agreement, or procedure.
     4.7.1. When a mishap/event involves only foreign military assets and/or personnel, the
     foreign nation military authorities are responsible for the investigation. The USAF
     generally reserves the right to participate as an observer on the foreign safety investigation
     or, if no investigation is conducted, the right to conduct its own safety investigation.
     4.7.2. When a mishap/event involves a foreign military aircraft and a US civilian
     aircraft in the CONUS, the NTSB has priority over the investigation. See paragraph 4.8.
     4.7.3. When a mishap/event involves both USAF and foreign assets and/or personnel
     (military or civilian), the Air Force will conduct a safety investigation. Depending on the
     circumstances the NTSB may take priority over the investigation.
4.8. Mishaps Involving Civil Aviation or Commercial Spacelift and/or Federal Air Traffic
Services.
     4.8.1. The NTSB investigates mishaps involving both Air Force and civil aircraft that
     occur within US jurisdiction. The Air Force may send an observer to the NTSB investigation
     and/or may conduct a separate investigation. However, the NTSB has priority over all
     evidence.
     4.8.2. Air Force mishaps that occur within US jurisdiction involving commercial spacelift
     may be investigated by the NTSB, the FAA/AST, and the commercial vendor depending on
     the extent of the mishap. The Air Force may send an observer to any of these investigations
     and/or may conduct a separate investigation. If the NTSB leads the investigation, the NTSB
     has priority over all evidence. See AFMAN 91-222 for more information.
     4.8.3. See AFJI 91-206 for guidance on NTSB, FAA, and Air Force cooperation in these
     investigations.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                             43


4.9. Mishaps Involving Contractors.
   4.9.1. Government contractor involvement.
      4.9.1.1. If the Air Force administers the contract and the mishap involves reportable
      damage or injury to the Air Force (paragraph 1.3.1.1.), the MAJCOM/CC
      administering the contract is the convening authority. Convening authority may be
      delegated IAW paragraph 4.2. The convening authority will ensure the mishap is
      investigated and reported IAW this instruction and the terms of the contract.
      4.9.1.2. If the Air Force administers the contract and the mishap involves reportable
      damage or injury to another DOD agency (paragraph 1.3.1.1.), the MAJCOM/CC
      administering the contract will ensure all mishap information is sent to the involved
      agency with an information copy to HQ AFSC.
      4.9.1.3. If another DOD agency administers the contract and the mishap involves
      reportable damage or injury to the Air Force (paragraph 1.3.1.1.), the contracting
      command (MAJCOM who owned the resources) will ensure the mishap is investigated
      and reported according to this instruction.
   4.9.2. Mishaps Involving Non-Accepted Air Force Aerospace Vehicles. The
   MAJCOM/CC who negotiates the contract for the aerospace vehicle is the convening
   authority. Convening authority may be delegated IAW paragraph 4.2. The convening
   authority is responsible for the safety investigation and reporting, although the aerospace
   vehicle may not be under the operational control of the Air Force. The aerospace vehicle
   loss is recorded as a mishap to the Air Force at large (paragraph 1.5.).
   4.9.3. Mishaps involving Aerospace Vehicles Leased to a Non-DOD Organization for
   Modification, Maintenance, Repair, Test, Contract Training, or Experimental Project for a
   DOD Component, when the Government has assumed Ground and Flight Risk. The
   MAJCOM/CC who negotiates the contract for the aerospace vehicle is the convening
   authority. Convening authority may be delegated IAW paragraph 4.2. The convening
   authority is responsible for the safety investigation and reporting, although the aerospace
   vehicle may not be under the operational control of the Air Force. The aerospace vehicle
   loss is recorded as a mishap to the Air Force at large (paragraph 1.5.).
      4.9.3.1. HQ AFMC normally negotiates all aircraft and engine leases. If another agency
      negotiates a lease, the agency and HQ AFMC shall determine whom the convening
      authority will be prior to executing the lease.
   4.9.4. Other Aerospace Vehicle Contractor Mishaps. If a mishap involves government-
   furnished or leased aerospace vehicles, or new production aerospace vehicles (accepted by
   the Air Force on a DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, but not yet
   delivered), the MAJCOM/CC of the command negotiating the contract/lease is the
   convening authority unless otherwise specified in the contract/lease agreement. In cases
   where contract/lease agreements specify investigative jurisdiction, follow the terms of such
   agreements. In no case will a non-Air Force agency have safety investigation jurisdiction.
4.10. Civilian Occupational Mishaps.
   4.10.1. OSHA officials may accompany Air Force safety investigators as observers, or they
   may conduct a separate investigation of occupational mishaps involving either a DOD
44                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


     civilian fatality or the inpatient hospitalizations of three or more civilian personnel (one of
     which must be an on-duty DOD civilian employee). Ensure Air Force personnel accompany
     OSHA officials.
     4.10.2. OSHA will be notified when an on-duty mishap resulting in an Air Force civilian
     employee fatality or involving the inpatient hospitalization of three or more people (one
     of which must be a DOD civilian employee) within 8 hours of an on-duty mishap
     (paragraph 2.7.7.3.).
4.11. Special Circumstances.
     4.11.1. Mishaps Involving Friendly Fire. For all mishaps falling within the definition of
     Friendly Fire, the combatant commander will convene a legal investigation to determine the
     facts of the incident and guide further actions. In consultation with the combatant
     commander, service or other commanders may convene a safety investigation as required.
     4.11.2. Mishaps Involving Potential Criminal Acts. If safety investigators discover evidence
     of criminal acts causal to the mishap, they must immediately stop the investigation and report
     this fact to the convening authority. The convening authority will, after coordinating with
     HQ USAF/SE, determine whether the safety investigation should continue or be suspended,
     and ensure that an appropriate legal investigation is initiated. Safety investigators should
     contact HQ AFSC/JA to discuss this issue.
        4.11.2.1. If the convening authority decides to suspend the safety investigation,
        investigators will give all non-privileged materiel to the legal investigators and provide
        them with the names of all known witnesses. Alert the criminal investigator if the safety
        investigator or SIB has interviewed any witnesses.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                  45


                                            Chapter 5

                                 SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS

5.1. General Information. The convening authority determines the depth of investigative effort
required for each mishap, subject to this instruction and the appropriate discipline specific safety
manual (AFMAN91-22X). Several factors influence the depth of investigative effort required:
severity of injury or occupational illness, future mishap potential, and whether another agency‘s
investigation will produce a report the Air Force can use for mishap prevention. Other agencies,
such as the local police or NTSB, may investigate mishaps that occur within their jurisdiction. A
separate Air Force investigation will be completed when required by this instruction, however,
the safety investigator may use the other agencies‘ reports and information when applicable.
5.1. (AFMC) General Information. When the AFMC/CC is the convening authority, the SIB
president will provide weekly updates to the AFMC/CC.
   5.1.1. (Added-AFMC) When aircraft/UAV or air-launched missiles incur grounding
   action, or action is required prior to the next flight, the SPMs prepare recommendations
   according to TO 00-5-15, Air Force Time Compliance Technical Order Process; AFI 63-
   1201, Assurance of Operational Safey, Suitability,& Effectiveness; and AFMCI 21-302,
   Processing Interim Technical Orders and Rapid Action Changes (RAC). Aircraft can be
   grounded by a variety of methods.
       5.1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) The SPM as specified in AFI 63-1201 paragraph 2.8.1., in
       conjunction with the operating commands and other Air Force users, will determine,
       document, track and maintain positive control of baselines for operational safety,
       suitability and effectiveness. OSS&E guidance does not infringe on the MAJCOM/CC
       prerogative to operate less than fully mission capable systems IAW AFI 63-1201,
       paragraph 2.10.
       5.1.1.2. (Added-AFMC) For safety reasons, the SPM could ground a fleet of aircraft by
       revoking the air worthiness certificate for the fleet IAW AFPD 62-6, USAF Aircraft
       Airworthiness Certification. Normally, the SPM would issue an immediate and urgent
       action TCTO according to TO00-5-15 which would effectively ground the identified
       block of aircraft until the TCTO‘s are complied with. The TCTO is generally written in
       full coordination with the MAJCOM before it is released. TO compliance can be
       waived for exceptional circumstances as identified in AFI21-303, Technical Orders.
       5.1.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Commanders can effectively ground aircraft by ―standing
       down‖ flying operations of a particular type aircraft for safety or other operations risks.
       5.1.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Individual aircraft can be grounded with a red X in the aircraft
       forms. A red X indicates that the aerospace vehicle is considered unsafe or
       unserviceable and will not be flown or used until the unsatisfactory condition is corrected
       and/or the symbol is cleared. The process to clear a red X is found in TO 00-20-1,
       Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policy and Procedures.
5.2. Investigation Timeline. The safety investigation should be completed within 30 days of the
mishap. The investigation should place a greater priority on a complete and accurate safety report
than on trying to finish in the 30 day timeline. If the investigation cannot be completed within
46                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


this 30 day period, the SIB/ SIO will request an extension from the convening authority. The
convening authority will send a copy of their extension approval to HQ AFSC. EXCEPTION:
There may be standing agreements for certain types of mishaps where the 30 day suspense is
extended (see the discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN91-22X).
5.3. Investigation Funding.
     5.3.1. Local Support. The commander of the Air Force installation hosting the SIB funds all
     in-house support even if the host installation is not assigned to the investigating
     MAJCOM. See paragraph 5.3.5. for expenses that exceed the resources of the host
     installation.
     5.3.2. TDY Travel. Each MAJCOM, via their respective wings/units, funds TDY of its
     assigned personnel who are Air Force SIB members or technical experts, according to
     AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance Procedures. TDY SIB members should be placed
     on full per diem for the duration of the SIB. Dual billeting and rental car should be
     authorized. For joint service boards, each service funds its own members‘ TDY. The
     investigating MAJCOM funds travel costs of members from another service appointed to
     an Air Force SIB. Observers to an Air Force SIB fund their own TDY.
     5.3.2. (AFMC) TDY travel orders and funding are the responsibility of the parent unit of
     the AFMC participant. Place ―ESP CODE: SI‖ at the end of the unit‘s fund cite to identify
     safety investigation expenditures on all safety investigation-related TDY orders and
     funding, to include technical assistance.
     5.3.3. Contractor support. Normally contractors will always travel via their own funding. To
     provide easier access to the base and its facilities required during the investigation, the
     contractor may request a Letter of Identification from the Contracting Officer. The
     convening authority will honor these requests. The Letter of Identification will not have a
     fund cite, i.e., no cost to the government. Joint Travel Regulations, Volume 2, Appendix E,
     Part I, paragraph D and E are applicable.
     5.3.4. Other Support. The convening authority funds leasing of special
     equipment/vehicles, leased communications, and other contractual services. For technical
     assistance and laboratory analysis (paragraph 5.5.) from non-Air Force specialist, the
     convening authority or SM may have to provide funding to obtain a response.
     5.3.5. Cost Overruns. Request an operating budget authority (OBA) adjustment per AFI 65-
     601, Volume 2, Budget Management for Operations, if investigation costs cannot be
     financed through reprogramming within the OBA.
5.4. Investigation Options. The size and membership of the investigation depends on the
category and complexity of the mishap being investigated. The investigation must have the
correct complement of members to properly complete the investigation. Investigations may be
made up of multiple members (SIB), or a single member (SIO). Refer to the discipline
specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X) for requirements. The SIB will inform the convening
authority of all members of the investigation (SIB members, observers, and technical experts).
     5.4.1. Safety Investigation Boards (SIB). SIBs are made up of multiple members assigned to
     investigate a mishap. Contractor representatives will not be members of a SIB. They are
     technical experts providing assistance to a SIB.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                               47


     5.4.1.1. At least one SIB member must be equal to or senior in rank to the senior person
     directly involved in the mishap. Normally, the SIB president is the senior SIB member.
     5.4.1.2. Select SIB members who do not have a personal interest in the investigation and
     who are able to act impartially. SIB members will be selected from outside the mishap
     wing whenever possible.
     5.4.1.3. Select a SIB member qualified in safety investigation for each safety discipline
     involved in the mishap.
     5.4.1.4. Do not assign foreign exchange officers or other foreign officers serving with
     the USAF as formal SIB members. This exclusion does not apply to HQ AFSC SIB
     representatives. Comply with provisions in standing international agreements.
     5.4.1.5. ARC participation in SIBs. Convening authority may appoint Reservists/Air
     National Guardsmen to SIBs with the concurrence of the AFRC/National Guard
     Bureau (NGB). Ensure SIB duties do not create a conflict of interest with the individual's
     civilian occupation or interests.
         5.4.1.5.1. AFRC. Air Reserve Technicians may elect to participate in either military
         or civilian status, as appropriate. Traditional reservists will be in a military status.
         5.4.1.5.2. ANG. ANG personnel may elect to participate in either military or
         technician status, as appropriate.
     5.4.1.6. All safety investigations involving ARC assets that are conducted by a SIB shall
     be permitted to have at least one member selected by the AFRC or NGB, as applicable.
     5.4.1.7. (Added-AFMC) Civilians assigned to center/wing safety offices that have
     previous Air Force aircraft qualification (pilot or navigator) and are graduates of the
     FSO or AMIC courses may perform IO duties on a SIB.
  5.4.2. Single Investigating Officer (SIO). Depending on the circumstances of the mishap, an
  individual investigator may be appointed to conduct the investigation.
     5.4.2.1. (Added-HILL) Unless the convening authority determines a different
     investigative process is warranted, all Class C and D mishaps will be investigated using
     the Hill AFB Mishap Investigation Checklist. This checklist will be submitted to OO-
     ALC/SE with the completed OSHA Form 301, Injuries and Illnesses Incident Report.
     The        current      version       of       this    form       is      found        at
     http://www.osha.gov/recordkeeping/new-osha300form1-1-04.pdf.
  5.4.3. Air Force Participation in Non-Air Force Investigations. When Air Force
  representation to another Service‘s investigation is desired, HQ AFSC will contact the
  MAJCOM(s) that can best meet the requirement. The MAJCOM/SE will coordinate the
  selection with HQ AFSC. Once HQ USAF/ SED approves the nominee, HQ AFSC will
  provide a fund site to the MAJCOM and establish direct communication with the individual.
  Air Force representatives to Joint Safety Investigations should be graduates of formal Air
  Force safety training courses.
  5.4.4. Participation in Air Force Investigations by Non-Air Force Personnel. Sometimes a
  mishap involves weapon systems or equipment common to another US military service
  or agency (FAA, NASA, etc.). In these cases personnel from the other service or agency may
48                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


     request to observe the Air Force investigation. HQ AFSC forwards these requests to the
     convening authority. Refer to AFJI91-206 and applicable MOA/MOUs for interagency
     involvement. Observers are authorized to observe SIB activities and may participate to the
     extent authorized by the SIB president and published guidance. An observer is not a member
     of the Air Force SIB. Non-DOD observers may not participate in interviews where a witness
     is given a promise of confidentiality or in the safety investigators‘ analysis. EXCEPTION:
     For NTSB and FAA observers, see AFJI 91-206
     5.4.4. (AFMC) For mishaps involving contracts managed by DCMA, a DCMA safety
     trained representative may be assigned to the SIB as an observer. NOTE: To be safety
     trained, the DCMA representative must be a graduate of FSO, AMIC, JEMIC, or the OSHA
     Advanced Accident Investigation Course.
5.5. Obtaining and Using Technical Assistance and Laboratory Analysis. When the
investigation is beyond the expertise of the SIB/SIO, request technical assistance.
5.5. (AFMC) Obtaining and Using Technical Assistance and Laboratory Analysis. SPMs
provide the center safety offices updated rosters of qualified technical expert members
semiannually (January, July). The roster will have as a minimum, a primary and alternate
member for all major areas needed to support each weapon system.
     5.5.1. For all Class A and B mishaps, technical assistance and laboratory analysis will be
     requested through HQ AFSC IAW published convening authority procedures. For all other
     mishap classes, technical assistance and laboratory analysis is available through HQ AFSC.
     NOTE: See Attachment 2 for technical assistance contact information.
     5.5.2. Using Technical Experts.
        5.5.2.1. Technical experts supporting an investigation are under the control and
        authority of the SIB president or SIO. This applies to DOD military and civilian
        personnel as well as contractor representatives.
        5.5.2.1. (AFMC) Technical experts shall support the SIB until released by the SIB
        president.
        5.5.2.2. Upon completion of their investigations, technical experts must provide a
        written report (signed paper copy and an electronic copy) detailing results of their work. A
        specific report format is not required, but the format in Figure 5.1. is suggested.
        5.5.2.3. SIB presidents and SIOs must ensure a "non-disclosure statement" on protection
        of privileged data is prepared (Figure A3.7.) and endorsed by all technical experts
        (e.g., contractors, NTSB, FAA, etc.) who are offered a promise of confidentiality or
        provided access to privileged information. NOTE: See paragraph 3.2.5.2. for safety
        investigations where a promise of confidentiality is authorized. This memorandum is not
        required from Air Force civilian employees.
     5.5.3. Reports from Technical Experts.
        5.5.3.1. All technical experts are encouraged to summarize observations, analysis, and
        conclusions based solely on physical evidence and other factual information. The
        SIB/SIO will thoroughly review all reports from technical experts to ensure they
        do not contain privileged information.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                   49


       5.5.3.2. Technical experts may also provide analysis and conclusions regarding
       privileged information (paragraph 3.2.5.5. and 3.3.3.5.1.). See Figure A3.8. for the
       cover sheet on privileged reporting.
       5.5.3.3. If conflicting reports from different technical experts or laboratories are received,
       include both reports in the formal report. In the investigative narrative, provide rationale
       explaining why one report was determined to be more applicable and why opposing
       views were discounted.

Figure 5.1. Suggested Technical Analysis Summary Format.




       5.5.3.4. (Added-AFMC) Agencies that have technical experts will develop mishap
       investigation checklists for team members. Send a copy of the checklist to the center
       safety office for review. Checklists give:
           5.5.3.4.1. (Added-AFMC) A general overview of the system involved.
           5.5.3.4.2. (Added-AFMC) A discussion of historical failure modes.
           5.5.3.4.3. (Added-AFMC) Names and telephone numbers of major subsystems
           investigation specialists and laboratory contacts.
   5.5.4. (Added-AFMC) When laboratory analysis or DR is required for a component, the
   SIB president may designate an individual (fully briefed on all factors involved in the
   mishap) to accompany the item. This individual will observe the laboratory analysis or DR
   and will request a preliminary written evaluation for the SIB.
5.6. Controlling Information Collected by the SIB/SIO. SIB presidents/SIOs will ensure
that all information, privileged or not, collected by safety investigators, is not released outside
safety channels except in accordance with this instruction or upon approval of the convening
authority. The SIB president/SIO is the final point of release for all information (including
electronic/digital media, photographs, etc.) from the safety investigation.
50                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


     5.6.1. SIB presidents/SIOs will ensure that everyone working on their team is briefed on the
     restrictions. Every member of a safety investigation team that produces a formal report (Table
     6.2.) will sign the memorandum at Figure 5.2. acknowledging the guidance and restrictions
     placed on information gathered during a safety investigation. The memorandum will be filed
     in Tab A of the formal report.

Figure 5.2. Memorandum Documenting Guidance to Investigators on Controlling
Information.




        5.6.1.1. The SIB/SIO is not prohibited from sharing information with technical
        experts who, although not members of a board, analyze information or wreckage on
        behalf of safety investigators.
5.7. Investigative Evidence.
     5.7.1. Impounding Air Force Materiel/Wreckage. ISB/SIB/SIO have inherent priorities
     over other activities and investigations connected to the mishap, including the right to
     impound Air Force property involved in the mishap. Group commanders or higher are
     required to act on their impoundment requests. However, safety of personnel (to include
     emergency response forces) and control of hazardous materiels always take precedence over
     safety investigations, even at the risk of losing evidence. An installation commander in
     coordination with the ISB president or SIB president may choose to remove wreckage
     interfering with essential mission activities or causing a hazard at the mishap scene. Wreckage
     may need to be removed or destroyed to prevent interference with operations or vital civil
     functions. If wreckage must be moved prior to the arrival of the SIB/SIO, thoroughly
     document the site (photographs, video) prior to moving if time permits.
     5.7.2. Life Science Evidence. This includes the physical exam, laboratory and radiological
     testing of survivors, personal equipment, life support equipment, medical/dental/mental
     health/OB/GYN/substance abuse/family advocacy charts and past histories and initial
     medical interviews, and other information which points to the mental and physical
     capability of the personnel involved in the mishap. Human remains are also evidence. The
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                               51


  SIB medical member should be aware of where all remains are and what their status is, i.e.,
  awaiting autopsy, return to family, etc. Consult the mortuary officer of the supporting base to
  determine if civil authorities have jurisdiction over human remains. The mortuary officer
  should have an MOA/MOU with civil authorities according to AFI 34-242, Mortuary
  Affairs Program. Safety personnel, ISB and SIB medical members shall ensure AFIP is
  notified and given contact information for civil authorities exercising jurisdiction over
  human remains when a fatal mishap occurs.
  5.7.3. Witnesses. Use the following guidelines for witnesses:
     5.7.3.1. Do not administer truth serums, hypnotic techniques, drugs, or polygraph tests.
     If a witness provides a statement while under medication, add a notation to their
     statement.
     5.7.3.2. If a witness refuses to testify, contact the MAJCOM/JA.
     5.7.3.3. Do not have witnesses testify under oath. Ensure witnesses understand that
     they are obliged to give honest, good faith testimony. See paragraph 3.2.5. for a
     discussion on the promise of confidentiality.
     5.7.3.4. If a safety investigator believes Air Force personnel questioned in the
     investigation may be guilty of criminal misconduct, refer to paragraph 4.11.2.
     5.7.3.5. Interviewing witnesses suspected of criminal misconduct. If, after suspending
     a safety investigation because of potential criminal acts, the convening authority decides
     to continue the safety investigation, safety investigators may have to interview
     witness(es) suspected of criminal misconduct. Contact HQ AFSC/JA if the SIB is
     required to interview suspected criminals.
     5.7.3.6. Retaining Access to Participants. Safety investigators may need frequent
     access to or multiple interviews with participants in a mishap. Commanders will make
     all participants available to the investigation upon request of the SIB president/SIO. The
     SIB president/SIO will advise the commander when participants are no longer needed.
     5.7.3.7. Returning Participants to Duty. Safety investigators make no determinations
     regarding the fitness of participants to be returned to normal duties. Commanders decide
     if and when participants are to be returned to duty.
     5.7.3.8. Commercial Space Launch Mishap. Refrain from interviewing witnesses until
     the FAA/ NTSB representative has arrived, unless there is a compelling reason to take
     the witness‘ statement(s) immediately.
     5.7.3.9. This instruction requires collecting and maintaining information protected by the
     Privacy Act of 1974 as authorized by Title 10 United States Code, section 8013 and
     Executive Order 9397.
         5.7.3.9.1. Safety investigators will request the SSN of military members and civilian
         employees involved in reportable mishaps. Inform individuals that Title 10 USC
         8013 and EO 9397 are the legal authority for requesting the SSN and that the SSN
         will be used for safety mishap investigating and reporting.
  5.7.4. Disposing of Evidence.
52                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


        5.7.4.1. Operational assets. Once the investigation has recovered all necessary evidence
        from the asset involved in the mishap, the safety investigator will, at an appropriate
        time, advise the convening authority (after coordinating with the legal board if required)
        when the asset can be turned over to the operating unit. The legal board is responsible
        for operational assets given to them by the SIB. The convening authority is the final
        authority to release the asset to the operating unit. EXCEPTION: All wreckage from
        Class A space, aviation, and guided missile mishaps require a formal release from
        AFLSA/JACT before being released to the operating unit.
        5.7.4.2. Wreckage.
            5.7.4.2.1. After the SIB has gathered all necessary information from the wreckage,
            and there is a legal investigation, transfer custody of the wreckage to the legal board
            president in writing IAW AFMAN 91-22X.
            5.7.4.2.2. Release wreckage not needed in support of depot, laboratory, or the legal
            investigation to the host installation commander in writing for storage until the
            wreckage is released for disposal. AFLSA/JACT is the release authority for Class A
            space, aviation, and guided missile mishaps. The host legal office is the release
            authority for all other mishaps.
            5.7.4.2.3. All reasonable actions must be made to remove and properly dispose of
            wreckage. Special care must be given to the removal of all wreckage on private or
            state owned property.
        5.7.4.3. Other Evidence.
            5.7.4.3.1. For Class A mishaps, or when notified there will be a legal board for other
            mishaps, provide all non-privileged evidence (photographs, videotapes, data,
            documentation, and other evidence) to the legal board in writing IAW AFMAN 91-
            22X. The legal board will be responsible for final disposition of all materiel released
            to them by the SIB. For other than Class A mishaps, when there is no legal board,
            contact the host installation staff judge advocate for guidance on disposing of
            materiels that may needed in potential claims or litigation. If there are no such
            requirements, reproduce enough copies for the safety report and then return the
            original documents and records used by the SIB to their proper custodian.
            5.7.4.3.2. In the case of fatalities, the disposition of human bodies and human tissue
            is dependent on who has legal jurisdiction over the remains; often this may be a local
            civilian coroner or medical examiner. Work with Mortuary Affairs and the local JA
            to clarify jurisdiction and disposition of human remains.
5.8. Identifying Hazards.
     5.8.1. The requirements in this section apply to all Class A and B mishaps. These same
     requirements can be applied to other occurrences if desired.
     5.8.2. Identify and document hazards that played a role in the mishap sequence. Hazards are
     defined as "any real or potential condition that can cause injury or occupational illness to
     personnel; damage to or loss of a system, equipment or property; or damage to the
     environment." Determine whether individuals or management addressed these hazards
     during preparation and execution of the mishap sequence.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                 53


5.9. Determining and Documenting Findings.
   5.9.1. Findings are based on the weight of evidence, professional knowledge, and good
   judgment.
   5.9.2. Each finding is a single event or condition. Each finding is an essential step in the
   mishap sequence, but each finding is not necessarily causal. Do not include any more
   information than is necessary to explain the event.
   5.9.3. Each finding must have a logical connection to preceding findings. If no logical
   relationship exists, the sequence of the mishap has not been correctly described.
   5.9.4. Ensure critical events required to sustain the mishap sequence have not been
   omitted. Conversely, do not include events interesting to the reader, but not necessary
   to sustain the mishap sequence.
   5.9.5. In some cases the sequence begins long before the actual mishap sequence with such
   things as design problems, improperly written directives, or an inadequate training program.
   5.9.6. Ensure the sequence continues to the point where all damage or injury has occurred and
   the initial rescue or recovery actions are completed.
   5.9.7. Include injuries occurring in the mishap, at the appropriate chronological point in
   the event sequence. For example, insert ejection injury events occurring before the aircraft-
   ground impact finding at the proper chronological point. Injuries or fatalities suffered by
   persons on the ground following a crash would be at the end of the main sequence, (e.g., "the
   Range Safety Officer successfully initiated the self-destruct sequence; debris from the
   launch booster crashed into a fishing boat, fatally injuring two people" or "the pilot ejected
   successfully; the aircraft crashed in a parking lot adjacent to the runway, fatally injuring two
   persons").
   5.9.8. Findings are arranged in chronological order. Number the findings consecutively.
   Precede each number with the word "Finding" (e.g., Finding 1, Finding 2, etc.).
   5.9.9. Write findings as full sentences, not bullet points. Use past tense, since the events
   occurred in the past. (Example: Incorrect – Crew chief clears pilot from chocks and the pilot
   taxis to runway. Correct – The crew chief cleared the pilot from the chocks and the pilot
   taxied to the runway.)
   5.9.10. When the safety investigator cannot pinpoint a correctable event in a sequence, list as
   much of the sequence as can be supported and insert a statement relating to the undetermined
   area. If there are supportable alternatives identify them as such and list them. Show them as
   subordinate to the applicable finding by using a format such as "event X most likely occurred
   due to one or more of the following reasons."
      5.9.10.1. The reasons should be listed from most probable to least probable.
      5.9.10.2. Do not list all of the possible alternatives that could have existed merely
      because they cannot be eliminated. Place this sort of conjecture in the analysis and
      narrative.
   5.9.11. Do not include people‘s names, names of Air Force bases or companies in the
   findings. Use terms as "the aircraft," "the flight lead," "the wingman," "the F-16 pilot," "the
   pilot," "the crew," "the instructor loadmaster," "the evaluator boom operator," or "the
54                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


     crewchief." NOTE: Do not use the term mishap in front of the object, i.e., mishap aircraft,
     mishap pilot, mishap crewchief. Be specific, but do not include supporting evidence in the
     findings. The report narrative includes supporting evidence and conclusions.
     5.9.12. Findings shall not include new materiel not addressed in the narrative. If the
     finding is not identifiable in the narrative, you have not written the narrative completely.
     5.9.13. After developing the findings, apply the following "Findings Test" for validation:
        5.9.13.1. Is the Finding necessary to sustain the mishap sequence?
        5.9.13.2. Is the Finding a single event or condition?
        5.9.13.3. Is the Finding specific enough without including supporting evidence?
        5.9.13.4. Does the Finding logically connect to the preceding finding? Read the last
        finding; ask "why"? Does the finding above answer the "why"? Continue for each
        finding.
        5.9.13.5. Is the Finding relevant or simply interesting to the reader?
5.10. Determining and Documenting Causes.
     5.10.1. A cause is a deficiency, which if corrected, eliminated, or avoided, would likely
     have prevented or mitigated the mishap damage or significant injury. Cause does not imply
     blame. The intent is to identify the point where corrective action is needed.
     5.10.2. Findings that sustained the mishap sequence, but were normal to the situation as it
     developed are not causal. In most instances a causal finding is correctable by commanders,
     supervisors, or individuals.
     5.10.3. Apply the reasonable person concept when determining a cause. If a person‘s
     performance or judgment was reasonable considering the mishap circumstances, do not
     assign cause. It is not appropriate to expect extraordinary or uniquely superior performance
     in such cases. Human factors (physiological or psychological) may be causal even
     though they are reasonable. These are often the unavoidable effects of a preceding cause.
     5.10.4. Do not list a party as causal for not taking an action unless they should reasonably
     have been expected to take such action, but they did not. Similar rationale applies to lack of
     a system or procedure. Do not list failure to provide a system or procedure as causal unless
     a party should reasonably have been expected to do so given the information available prior
     to the mishap.
     5.10.5. Not every finding is causal. Some are effects or the expected result of a previously
     identified cause even though their inclusion sustains the sequence leading to the mishap.
     An engine flameout precipitated by a fuel boost pump failure is the expected result of the
     boost pump failure and is not causal. The boost pump failure may have been a result of an
     even earlier cause such as a bearing failure.
     5.10.6. Environmental conditions such as a bird strike, lightning, high wind, solar wind,
     meteorites, or flood, may be causal only if all reasonable avoidance and damage/injury
     mitigation actions were taken.
     5.10.7. An individual, group or organization is virtually always responsible for a failure.
     Publications or objects should almost never be found causal. Rather, the party responsible for
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                55


   ensuring the publications are correct or the party responsible for ensuring an object does not
   fail with catastrophic consequences is causal, unless the party took all reasonably expected
   actions. In such cases, there may be process or organizational failures, and appropriate
   parties may be identified as responsible for these failures.
      5.10.7.1. The intent of identifying causal parties in an investigation is to identify the
      point where corrective action is needed, not to place blame. As such, safety investigators
      need to ensure they identify the correct causal agent. This can be done by asking "Why"
      something occurred until the investigator comes to a "dead end."
   5.10.8. Occasionally, an investigator may not be able to conclusively determine a
   specific causal event. In these special cases, the investigator may choose to list two or three
   most probable causes for each option. In rare instances the causal event may be unknown.
   5.10.9. Causal findings should always be worded in active voice, clearly identifying the
   actor(s) and causal action (deficiency), along with any necessary explanation. Examples:
   Passive – No safety pins were installed in the widget. Active – The crew chief failed to
   install safety pins in the widget as required by tech orders. Passive – Mission planning did
   not cover en-route obstacles. Active – The crew failed to address en-route obstacles in
   mission planning as required.
   5.10.10. Identify causal findings by adding the word "CAUSE" to the beginning of the
   finding statement. Do not list causes under a separate heading. Word a causal finding as a
   clear and simple statement of a single condition or event.
   5.10.11. Causal findings should identify the causal agent ("Who") and the action taken
   ("What"). Why the action (or lack of action) occurred should be fully explained in the
   narrative and may be included in the causal finding if appropriate.
   5.10.12. After determining the causal findings, apply the following "Cause Test" for
   validation:
      5.10.12.1. Is the Causal Finding correctable by commanders, supervisors or individuals?
      5.10.12.2. Is the Causal Finding a clear and simple statement of a single condition or
      event?
      5.10.12.3. Is the Causal Finding in the active voice and does it follow the format: Who
      did what to whom/what and why?
      5.10.12.4. If the Causal Finding is an effect or an expected result of a previously
      identified cause, even though its inclusion sustains the mishap sequence, it is not causal.
5.11. Determining and Documenting Recommendations.
   5.11.1. Recommendations are feasible and effective solutions to eliminate identified hazards,
   or if the hazard cannot be eliminated, to mitigate the hazard‘s potential consequences. With
   few exceptions, all safety investigations (including Class E reports) should include
   recommendations to prevent or mitigate future mishaps. If no recommendations are made,
   investigators will explain their rationale in the report narrative.
   5.11.2. Developing feasible and effective recommendations is a methodical process, which
   seeks to identify risk mitigation alternatives. It is essential to know precisely what
   deficiency, or identified hazard, one is addressing and to stay focused on it.
56                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


     5.11.3. Developing sound recommendations also requires recognition of the "order of
     precedence" concept, which recognizes that not all risk mitigation alternatives are equal.
     Design fixes are the most preferable solution because they can often completely eliminate
     the hazard, but these types of fixes often have the highest upfront costs. They may require
     unacceptable operational constraints so additional alternatives must be considered. Along
     with design fixes, one should look for potential fixes that incorporate safety and warning
     devices. Lastly, look at changes to procedures and training.
     5.11.4. All recommendations should target one or more of the hazards identified during the
     investigation. It is also sometimes prudent to make two or more recommendations against
     one hazard. In all cases use the order of precedence to develop risk mitigation alternatives.
     As an example, to eliminate or mitigate the identified hazard of "pilot‘s failure to command
     landing gear extension," which results in a gear-up landing of a training aircraft, one might
     consider the following:
        5.11.4.1. Design: Implement a fixed gear.
        5.11.4.2. Incorporate Safety Devices: Implement an auto-extend system.
        5.11.4.3. Provide Warning Devices: Implement cockpit warning lights, warning tone or
        voice.
        5.11.4.4. Develop Training and Procedures: Improve the written checklist, or its use via
        training with instructors and in simulators.
     5.11.5. Based upon the specific information discovered during the investigation, selected
     alternatives should be formulated into feasible and effective recommendations and other
     alternatives discarded. The purpose of using the ‗order of precedence‘ is to ensure
     investigations consider the entire range of available options and not just the cheap and easy
     ones – which usually have the least mishap prevention value.
     5.11.6. A great deal of debate usually surrounds what is feasible and effective. Sometimes a
     risk mitigation alternative is technically feasible and effective, but it is clearly not
     economically feasible or has unacceptable mission consequences. In this case, discard the
     alternative. In other cases it may not be clear that an alternative is either technically
     feasible or economically feasible. In these cases, include a recommendation for formal
     evaluation.
     5.11.7. Most causal findings should have recommendations for future prevention or
     mitigation, although exceptions are permitted. Likewise, findings that are not causal may also
     have recommendations written against them.
     5.11.8. Recommendations may also vary in scope. Some actions can be taken at unit level.
     Other recommendations require MAJCOM or other agency actions.
     5.11.9. If a recommendation depends on tests or analyses that are incomplete when the report
     is transmitted, explain this and provide a reference to the tests or analyses (such as
     deficiency report, study, or contract number).
     5.11.10. Recommendations should require the action agency to correct a deficiency rather
     than to implement a particular solution. The action agency normally has greater expertise
     than the investigators and should be given the opportunity to develop the optimal solution for
     a problem. The following examples illustrate this point: Poor – Move the right engine fire
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                              57


  pushbutton to the right side of the cockpit. Better – Implement changes to the engine fire
  pushbuttons to help preclude engine shutdown errors.
  5.11.11. Avoid recommendations that only require a study or evaluation. Action should be
  required based upon results of any recommended study. In most cases, it is not necessary to
  recommend a study or evaluation, since studies or evaluations are implicit in the process. The
  recommendation can simply require corrective action. Examples: Poor – Evaluate the
  feasibility of changes to the anti-lock system. Better – Implement changes to the anti-lock
  system to prevent loss of feedback.
  5.11.12. General, vague, sweeping, or open-ended recommendations that cannot be closed
  by the action agency are not appropriate. Write recommendations that have a definitive
  closing action.
  5.11.13. Do not recommend briefing personnel on the mishap. Such a briefing is a basic
  commander responsibility and a normal function of safety offices at all levels of command.
  5.11.14. Do not recommend reminding personnel of the importance of simply doing their
  jobs properly. However, recommendations to place CAUTIONS and WARNINGS in TOs
  guidance relating the adverse consequences of not doing one‘s job properly may be
  appropriate. Recommendations for specific action such as refresher training, implementing
  in-process inspections, etc., to ensure job duties are being properly performed, may also
  be appropriate since they are specific and can be closed.
  5.11.15. Number recommendations consecutively and precede each number by the word
  "Recommendation." (e.g., Recommendation 1, Recommendation 2, etc.). Include only one
  statement for each recommendation. Rather than sub-grouping recommendations (e.g., 1a, 1b,
  1c, etc.) use a new recommendation number.
  5.11.16. Recommendations to Change Publications.
     5.11.16.1. Recommendations may be made to change publications, technical orders,
     flight manuals, or checklists. Submit AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
     Publication (flight publications), according to AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program.
     Submit AFTO Form 22, Technical Manual Change Recommendation and Reply,
     according to TO 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order System. Utilize local base support
     personnel (Stan Eval and/or QA) for assistance in completing the forms. If the proposed
     change is time sensitive, use the emergency critical safety hazard message format in AFI
     11-215 or the emergency report format in TO 00-5-1.
     5.11.16.2. Obtain tracking number from MAJCOM Stan Eval for AF Forms 847 and unit
     QA for AFTO Forms 22. Place the tracking number, the mishap event number, and the
     mishap‘s AFSAS number (if mishap is reported via AFSAS) on submitted Forms 847 or
     22, to ensure these recommendations receive the appropriate levels of review. Also,
     place the tracking number after corresponding recommendation in the final
     message/report. Submit completed forms to the MAJCOM Stan Eval or LG Command
     Control Point (CCP), as applicable after the investigation is complete (paragraph 6.5.).
     5.11.16.3. In all cases, protect privileged safety information by sanitizing (paragraph
     3.3.1.) the "reason for recommended change" section of AFTO Form 22 or AF Form
58                           AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


        847. The SIB/SIO will place copies of the submitted forms in the applicable formal report
        tab.
     5.11.17. Determining the appropriate action agencies for each recommendation.
        5.11.17.1. Assign action agencies for all recommendations. An office of primary
        responsibility (OPR) is required for every recommendation. Although an office of
        collateral responsibility (OCR) is not required, they are appropriate for many
        recommendations. List only one OPR per recommendation. More than one OCR may
        be listed for an individual recommendation. Limit OPR and OCR assignment to two or
        three-digit organizational levels to ensure proper management level attention.
        5.11.17.2. Assign OPRs and OCRs based upon the lead command and user command
        philosophy. The Air Force assigns responsibility for overall management of each system
        to a "lead command" to ensure that all requirements associated with every system receive
        comprehensive and equitable consideration. This lead command provides primary
        input into the process of developing and maintaining a force structure with a balance
        of complementary capabilities, and it establishes a basis for rational allocation of scare
        resources among competing requirements. See AFPD 10-9, for more information.
        5.11.17.3. Normally, if a recommendation requires funding to effect changes to a
        weapon system (e.g., performing risk analyses or engineering studies, developing aircraft
        or component modifications, obtaining new test or support equipment, etc.), assign the
        appropriate office for the mishap weapon system, within the lead command as OPR. If
        the lead command only provides funds for the effort and another organization is
        responsible for performing or managing the work, assign these organizations as OCRs.
        For example: Implement changes to the B-1 to reduce the probability of encountering
        "hot brake" temperatures. OPR: ACC/DRA OCR: OC-ALC/LAB. In this example
        ACC/DRA is assigned as OPR because, as the appropriate office in the lead command,
        they would be responsible to arrange for the funding required to effect changes to the
        aircraft. Assuming that funding is provided, the B-1 system program office at OC-
        ALC/LAB is assigned as OCR since they would either perform the required work in-
        house or manage the contracted effort.
        5.11.17.4. Not all funding comes from the lead command. Sometimes it is possible for a
        system program office, item management office, laboratory or other organization to fund
        efforts through separate budgets. If a recommendation does not require funding from the
        lead command to effect changes to a weapon system (e.g., performing risk analyses or
        engineering studies, developing and obtaining preferred spares, developing inspection
        techniques and procedures, simple modifications and testing of software in conjunction
        with scheduled updates, limited flight and ground testing, etc.), assign the appropriate
        office that has the funding as OPR. Assign OCRs as required.
        5.11.17.5. Although changes to training programs, training equipment, and publishing
        new or changed paper documents (e.g., Air Force Policy Directives, Air Force
        Instructions, flight manuals, technical orders, etc.), require funding, assign the
        organization responsible for controlling the content of these products as OPR. Assign
        OCRs as required.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                  59


       5.11.17.6. Sometimes the responsibility for a recommendation lies outside the Air Force
       (e.g., the FAA for various air traffic control issues). Since the Air Force may not have the
       authority to task such agencies to perform recommended actions, do not assign non-Air
       Force agencies as OPRs or OCRs. In these cases, write the recommendation as an Air
       Force action and assign the appropriate Air Force organization as OPR. This Air Force
       organization is typically responsible for interaction with or contractual oversight of the
       outside agency and will ensure proper recommendation evaluation and disposition.
       Assign OCRs as required.
       5.11.17.7. Field Operating Agencies (FOA) normally accomplish Air Force-level
       actions, not the Air Staff itself. Therefore, assign the appropriate Field Operating
       Agencies as OPRs and OCRs, not the Air Staff. For example, air traffic issues are
       managed by the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA), not the Deputy Chief of
       Staff for Air and Space Operations (HQ USAF/XO). Similarly, Air Force Civil Engineer
       Support Agency (AFCESA) is the manager for civil engineering issues in the Air Force.
       5.11.17.8. Coordinate all recommendations with their proposed action agencies. Safety
       investigators must ensure they have correctly identified all OPRs and OCRs by making
       positive contact with each of them (call or email them) prior to publishing the formal
       report and/or final message. If circumstances prevent making positive contact with all
       action agencies, coordinate with the convening authority safety office to ensure proper
       action agencies have been identified.
5.12. Determining and Documenting Other Findings and Recommendations of
Significance (OFS, ORS). Guidance for developing and documenting primary findings and
recommendations applies similarly to OFSs and ORSs.
   5.12.1. Other Findings of Significance (OFS) are findings that the safety investigators
   believe could contribute to future mishaps and/or which warrant command attention, but were
   not part of the mishap sequence. OFS should be listed following the mishap
   recommendations in message and formal reports
   5.12.2. Other Recommendations of Significance (ORS) are recommendations resulting
   from OFS. Each OFS will be followed by its corresponding ORS. Assign an OPR(s) to each
   ORS.
5.13. Releasing Investigative Information. It is Air Force policy to keep the public
informed of Air Force mishaps and safety investigations and to release non-privileged
information, both favorable and unfavorable. Air Force policy complies with the requirements
of Title 10, United States Code, Section 2254(b) regarding the public disclosure of certain non-
privileged aircraft accident investigation information. The SIB president is the final point of
release for all information (including electronic/digital media, photographs, etc) from the SIB, but
will not communicate directly with the media or other members of the public. The release of non-
privileged information to news media, relatives, and other agencies is through the AIB
president, Survivor Assistance Program point of contact, Family Liaison Officer, or Public
Affairs representative as appropriate.
   5.13.1. The convening authority or designated information officer releases factual
   information about a mishap, including photographs, only as directed in AFPD 35-1, Public
   Affairs Management, and AFI 51-503. Federal statute does not permit officials involved in the
60                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


     safety investigation to be the officials releasing the information to the media or other
     members of the public.
     5.13.2. The AIB, in accordance with AFI 51-503, can release factual mishap
     information upon request. If an AIB is not formed, the local commander, through the public
     affairs or legal office, will release factual information. Information will not be released if
     it will jeopardize national defense, impede an ongoing or pending investigation (including
     the SIB or AIB), or if it is privileged safety information. The SIB president will coordinate
     with the AIB president as to whether the release of information will impede the SIB‘s
     investigation.
     5.13.3. Following mishaps where AFI 51-503 does not apply (nuclear, explosives and
     chemical agents, directed energy, afloat, motor vehicle, off-duty, ground and industrial) the
     convening authority through the public affairs or legal office may release factual
     information. Information will not be released if it will jeopardize national defense, impede
     an ongoing or pending investigation (including the SIB or legal investigation) or if it is
     privileged safety information. The SIB president will coordinate with the legal board
     president as to whether the release of information will impede the SIB‘s investigation.
5.14. Coordinating with the Legal Board.
     5.14.1. The SIB president provides Part 1 of the formal report and certain factual
     information to the legal board president as soon as possible (prior to completion of the
     investigation). See discipline specific safety manual for further guidance.
        5.14.1.1. Examples of information given to the legal board president include (this list
        contains examples only); a list of witnesses, cockpit and tower audio recordings, data
        recorders, coroner‘s report, autopsy report, toxicology test results, police reports,
        personnel and medical records.
     5.14.2. Persons occupying full-time safety positions routinely examine privileged
     documents. They are not permitted to serve on legal investigations as long as they are
     performing full-time safety duties. Legal investigators will not attend SIB/SIO proceedings,
     or meetings, or have access to or discuss any Part 2 privileged information with the SIB/SIO
     or Air Force safety officials. This prohibition also applies to the briefing given to the
     convening authority on the safety investigation results.
     5.14.3. ISB/SIB/SIO members will not be witnesses for other boards investigating the same
     mishap except to provide Part 1 factual information or to provide purely factual
     information within their knowledge that is not otherwise available.
     5.14.4. ISB/SIB/SIO members and technical advisors will not act as investigators or
     technical advisors for a legal investigation of the same mishap.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                61


                                           Chapter 6

                                REPORTS AND BRIEFINGS

6.1. General Information. Safety reports include message reports (preliminary, status, and
final), formal reports, and injury and occupational illness forms and logs. Whenever possible
safety reporting will be via the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS). Use the following
URL for AFSAS: https://sas.kirtland.af.mil/. If AFSAS is not available, safety reporting will
be via DMS IAW the discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X). The type of safety
report required and the timeline to report mishaps and brief the convening authority (if a
briefing is required) is in Table 6.2. Briefing investigation results is covered in paragraph 6.4.
The convening authority will determine what investigations can be briefed to the NAF/CC and
COMAFFOR (paragraph 6.4.1.) and what investigations will be briefed to the convening
authority. Aviation mishaps involving fatalities or other mishaps when requested, require a
briefing to the CSAF and SECAF. HQ AF/SEI will be the focal point for scheduling all briefings
to the CSAF and SECAF. If a final message or formal report needs to be changed after it is
completed, all primary SIB members must reconvene as only the primary SIB members are
authorized to change the report. The discipline specific safety manuals (AFMAN 91-22X)
provide guidance on primary SIB members.
6.1. (AFMC) General Information. The SIB president/SIO will brief the convening
authority on ALL (Class A, B, C, and D) mishaps. The SIB president/SIO will advise the
convening authority‘s safety office when an estimated completion date has been determined so
the briefing can be scheduled.
   6.1.1. Report classified mishap information (the classified portion of safety reports) via
   DMS. Report the unclassified portion of the report into AFSAS with classified data masked.
   6.1.2. The mishap event number is vital to tracking safety reports and serves as the single
   common worldwide identifier. The mishap event number and the mishap‘s AFSAS
   number (if mishap is reported via AFSAS) will be included on all safety reports and
   referred to in all related correspondence, and DRs. Consult the discipline specific safety
   manual (AFMAN 91-22X) for guidance on determining the mishap event number.
   6.1.3. (Added-AFMC) The OSHA Form 301 and the AFMC Supplemental Information
   Sheet, will be used for reporting military/civilian injuries and occupational illnesses to
   include first aid (occupation illness to DOD military or civilian personnel; injury to DOD
   military personnel onor off-duty; injury to on-duty DOD civilian personnel). AFI 91-204,
   Attachment 1, provides a definition of first aid. The OSHA Form 301 and AFMC
   Supplemental Information Sheet are used to notify appropriate agencies of injuries and
   occupational illnesses. The supervisor or medical treatment facility initiates the OSHA Form
   301 and AFMC Supplemental Information Sheet for each military/civilian injury and
   occupational illness. NOTE: If the supporting medical facility is owned by another
   MAJCOM, use the forms prescribed by that MAJCOM.
       6.1.3.1. (Added-AFMC) If employee is initially seen in the Emergency Room or
       Occupational Medicine Clinic, initiate the form and place a copy of the OSHA form 301
       in the medical record prior to sending it to the center/wing safety office and the
62                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


        immediate supervisor of the individual. If an occupational illness is suspected, forward a
        copy of the OSHA Form 301 and supplement to Public Health (PH).
        6.1.3.2. (Added-AFMC) The supervisor completes the reverse of the OSHA Form
        301 and AFMC Supplemental Information Sheet within 3 duty days and forwards a
        copy to the center/ wing safety office and one copy to the Civilian Personnel Flight for
        civilian employees.
        6.1.3.3. (Added-AFMC) The center/wing ground safety office retains all returned
        OSHA Form 301 and AFMC Supplemental Information Sheets as part of the official
        safety investigation report. Retain copies for five years.
        6.1.3.4. (Added-AFMC) The center/wing safety office will establish a method in
        coordination with the base medical facility and workers compensation office to ensure
        additional limited duty days or quarters days acquired during follow up visits are
        forwarded to the center/wing safety office. This method will ensure the OSHA 300 log
        is updated as required by 29 CFR 1960.
     6.1.4. (Added-AFMC) AFMC center/wing safety offices will forward a copy of the
     OSHA Form 300, Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illness, to HQ AFMC/SEG to arrive no
     later than the 10th calendar day of the following month. The center/wing safety offices will
     maintain documentation to support all no lost times cases.
6.2. Safety Message Reports. These safety reports are licensed as a part of the "Mishap
Message Reports" group (RCS: HAF-SE(AR)9402). Produce safety messages during declared
or war emergency conditions (emergency status code C2) IAW AFI 33-324, The Information
Collections and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency
Air Force Information Collections.
     6.2.1. Guidelines
        6.2.1.1. Messages will be marked with appropriate privileged markings IAW paragraph
        3.2.6.
        6.2.1.2. Table 6.2. and the discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X) provides
        message reporting requirements.
        6.2.1.3. Message Reports During MINIMIZE. During emergency                      condition
        MINIMIZE, send only the following messages by electronic transmission:
            6.2.1.3.1. Preliminary and status messages on nuclear mishaps and safety
            deficiencies resulting in a significant degradation of nuclear surety or having a
            serious operational impact (such as a possible code compromise).
            6.2.1.3.2. Preliminary and status messages on Class A and B on-duty mishaps.
            6.2.1.3.3. Send all other messages by first-class mail within 7 working days of the
            established timeline until MINIMIZE is canceled. MAJCOMs may consolidate
            messages from their units and subsequently mail them to addressees outside their
            command within 15 working days.
     6.2.2. Preliminary Message. The first electronically transmitted safety message
     advising of a non-nuclear occurrence is titled Preliminary Message (NOTE: OPREP-3
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                              63


   Reports do not satisfy this requirement). Preliminary messages are fully releasable (factual
   information only).
   6.2.3. Status Messages: Status messages are sent to explain report delays/extensions and
   relay new information discovered since the previous message. Status messages may include
   investigative conclusions such as what areas are considered to be factors and areas
   considered unlikely to be factors. If the status message is explaining a safety report
   delay/extension, explain the reason for the delay and the expected completion date. Safety
   investigators may send status messages as they deem necessary. Required status messages are
   listed in Table 6.2. Status messages are normally privileged.
       6.2.3.1. The convening authority‘s safety staff will closely follow mishaps that have
       damage estimates close to the threshold limits or injuries/occupational illnesses that
       have the potential for improving or worsening.
       6.2.3.2. A status message is required when a mishap class or category changes, e.g.,
       due to updated damage cost figures, a subsequent death from mishap injuries, or
       erroneous initial categorization.
          6.2.3.2.1. When a mishap classification increases, issue a status message within 1
          day.
          6.2.3.2.2. When a mishap classification decreases, issue a status message within 10
          days.
   6.2.4. Final Message. This message provides a narrative of the mishap/event sequence, states
   the mishap cause, and recommends preventive actions. It contains the investigation,
   analysis, and conclusions of the safety investigator. It is written so the reader clearly
   understands how the findings and causes were determined and clearly states the role of
   the individuals found causal in the mishap sequence. Include logic in how the
   recommendations were chosen as well as OPR/OCRs for the recommendations. The
   message may also include other findings and recommendations of significance, which do
   not relate directly to the causes of the mishap, but can be of value in risk management and
   mishap prevention. The final message is privileged. Complete the investigation and prepare
   the final message within the specified time limits in Table 6.2. The convening authority will
   release the final message after the investigation is complete (paragraph 6.5.). The
   convening authority may delegate this responsibility to the SIB/SIO. DO NOT delay release
   of the final message for internal command staffing.
   6.2.4. (AFMC) The convening authority will review the final message prior to it being
   released.
6.3. Formal Reports. Formal reports present detailed factual and analytical information about
mishaps. They are made up of Air Force Form 711-series forms and attached exhibits. All
forms in the Air Force Form 711-series are licensed as "Safety Investigation Reports" (RCS:
HAF-SE(AR) 9404). Formal reports will be released during declared or war emergency
conditions (emergency status code C2) IAW AFI 33-324.
   6.3.1. Privileged formal reports contain two parts: Part 1, Factual Information and
   Releasable Material; and Part 2, Board Conclusions and Non-Releasable Material. There
   may also be some supplemental information such as Comments Messages for MOFE, the
64                           AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


     MOFE, and any other significant information that was received after the MOFE is released.
     Part 1 contains factual information that may be disclosed outside the Air Force; Part 2
     contains privileged safety information and will not be disclosed outside Air Force safety
     channels. Table 6.1. contains tab designations of Part 1 and Part 2. Tab E is reserved as a
     discipline specific Tab; see discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X).

   6.3.2. MAJCOMs or HQ AFSC may direct preparation of a formal report for any mishap,
   even under circumstances where this instruction does not specifically require one.
   6.3.3. Formal reports will be formatted and assembled IAW with the discipline specific safety
   manual AFMAN 91-22X.
   6.3.4. Distributing the Formal Report
       6.3.4.1. The convening authority will distribute privileged formal reports to those in the
       Air Force with a need to know. Distribute the formal report to addressees as listed in the
       discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X). If there is a requirement to brief the
       convening authority, do not distribute the formal report prior to that briefing. Do not
       provide copies or extracts to agencies outside the Air Force. If an agency outside the Air
       Force needs a copy of the formal report for mishap prevention, corrective actions, or
       other purpose, notify HQ AFSC/JA by message or telephone before sending copies to
       these organizations.
       6.3.4.2. Do not produce "information only" copies of formal reports.
       6.3.4.3. The SIB president may keep a complete copy of the formal report (for briefing
       purposes) for 60 days. List this copy on the distribution memorandum and return it to the
       MAJCOM safety office for disposition.
       6.3.4.4. Formal reports will be maintained IAW AFMAN 37-123, Management of
       Records and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
       https://webrims.amc.af.mil.
6.4. Briefing Investigation Results. Once the SIB completes the investigation and finalizes
the formal report and the final message, the SIB will provide briefings at the discretion of the
convening authority. All briefings will be given with no prior screening of content. Board
independence is critical to the integrity of the SIB process. Historically, SIB independence is a
Congressional interest item, periodically reviewed by GAO and DOD/IG. The convening
authority will dictate briefing attendance.
6.4. (AFMC) Briefing Investigation Results. When the AFMC/CC is briefed on the results
of a safety investigation by the SIB president, the applicable center and wing commanders will
be present. The SIB president should consider bringing the SIB members whose expertise was
essential to the investigation. As a minimum, the IO will attend. For Class A aviation mishaps, a
representative from the applicable center/wing and/or depot will be present. The SIB members
attending the briefing will arrive two days prior to the briefing and stay after the brief until the
final message is approved and released by AFMC/CC. The SIB presidents will leave an
electronic copy of the AFMC/CC briefing slides and script with HQ AFMC/ SE after the
briefing. The Center and Wing Commanders will have slides that describe whether or not they
agree with the findings and recommendations of the SIB. They will brief what they have
already done about their operations with reference to the mishap.
   6.4.1. When the MAJCOM is the convening authority and with MAJCOM/CC approval, the
   SIB may brief the NAF/CC (or equivalent such as the Air Warfare Center Commander)
66                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


     and the affected COMAFFOR for a contingency mishap, for INFORMATIONAL
     PURPOSES ONLY, prior to briefing the MAJCOM/CC. All other briefings or disclosures of
     the report content, are prohibited.
     6.4.1. (AFMC) When the AFMC/CC is the convening authority, the SIB President will
     present an INFORMATION ONLY brief to the applicable center commander prior to the
     AFMC/CC brief.
        6.4.1.1. The NAF/CC (and COMAFFOR) and those invited per this instruction to the
        informational briefing will not direct changes to the SIB report or direct further
        investigation. The briefing must be free from the appearance of undue command
        influence that advice and directions can sometimes create.
        6.4.1.2. Except as noted below, the only personnel authorized to attend the
        informational NAF/ CC briefing are the NAF/CC, and with NAF/CC concurrence, the
        NAF/SE and the mishap wing commander. In the case of an ANG mishap, in addition
        to the above authorized attendees, the Director of the Air National Guard, and the
        mishap units‘s state Adjutant General may attend. In the case of an AFRC mishap, in
        addition to the above authorized attendees, the mishap AFRC NAF/CC may attend.
        For COMAFFOR information briefings, authorized attendees are the COMAFFOR,
        and with COMAFFOR concurrence, the AFFOR/SE, and the mishap air expeditionary
        wing commander.
        6.4.1.2. (AFMC) The wing commander will attend the INFORMATION ONLY briefing
        given to the center commander.
        6.4.1.3. In instances where the convening authority has been delegated, there will be no
        intermediate or informational briefings prior to briefing the convening authority.
     6.4.2. Safety investigation briefings will be afforded the same protection given the formal
     report. The following format is a guide to building the briefing:
     6.4.2. (AFMC) When AFMC/CC is the convening authority, the briefing is usually held in
     the Commander‘s Situation Room, Building 262. Dual screen capability is available. The
     briefing should be concise, 20-40 minutes target, but still cover the essentials. Consult HQ
     AFMC/SE web page for the latest PowerPoint template. The briefing will be scripted.
        6.4.2.1. Title Slide. Include mishap type, unit, vehicle or materiel, date, time of
        occurrence, and SIB president.
        6.4.2.2. SIB Composition. Show SIB members as well as technical experts consulted and
        used at the mishap scene.
        6.4.2.3. Overview. In bullet format present the basic circumstances of the mishap and
        give the bottom line cause(s) of the mishap.
        6.4.2.4. Personnel Background. Give a chronological list of assignments for personnel
        involved and their experience. Include skill and training qualifications. List the
        member‘s name on the slide. Consider a subjective appraisal of the personnel if
        appropriate.
        6.4.2.5. Mishap Sequence. Use as many slides as necessary. Map/route segments, vertical
        view of maneuvers, artist‘s conceptions, or models can be helpful. Explain what should
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                             67


      have happened if things had gone right, who was in charge, the rules of engagement
      and if they were followed, where things went wrong and what the involved persons
      should have done.
      6.4.2.6. Areas Investigated and Determined Not To Be a Factor. Do not dwell on these.
      A listing is usually adequate.
      6.4.2.7. Areas Found To Be Factors in the Mishap. Discuss each in detail in follow-up
      slides. Be sure to discuss training, supervision, discipline, tactics, and weather, as
      appropriate.
      6.4.2.8. Findings and Causes. Use the number of slides necessary without overcrowding.
      6.4.2.9. Conclusions and Recommendations. Use the number of slides necessary
      without overcrowding.
      6.4.2.10. Other Findings and Recommendations of Significance. Number
      sequentially. Place "Other Finding of Significance One" followed by "Other
      Recommendation of Significance One."
      6.4.2.11. Comments. Convening authority comments.
      6.4.2.12. Backup slides as determined by the SIB president. May include:
          6.4.2.12.1. 72-Hour and 14-Day Medical History. Be prepared to brief the 72-
          hour and 14-day history.
          6.4.2.12.2. Maintenance History on Aircraft or Vehicle. Include significant write-
          ups, Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO), and materiel problems.
          6.4.2.12.3. Any other pertinent information that supports the findings, conclusions,
          and recommendations.

 NOTES:
 1. If the investigation will not be complete (paragraph 6.5.) within the 30-day timeframe,
    transmit a status message on day 30 and every 30 days until the investigation is
    complete. Include estimated date of investigation completion.
  2. See discipline specific safety manual (AFMAN 91-22X).
  3. Class A and B off-duty military mishaps normally do not require a formal report. See
  AFMAN 91-224 for additional guidance.
6.5. Convening Authority Actions. The convening authority has two options upon the
completion of an investigation. The investigation is considered complete when the final
message, formal report (if required), and briefing to the convening authority (if required) are
accomplished.
     6.5.1. Accept the report as written and release the final message and formal report (if a
     formal report was required). DO NOT delay release of the final message or formal report
     for internal command staffing.
     6.5.2. Direct the SIB president and its members to conduct additional investigations. The
     convening authority will provide additional guidance to the SIB to ensure the report fulfills
     the purpose, intent, and requirements of the Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.
        6.5.2.1. After the SIB re-examines the areas identified by the convening authority and
        completes their reinvestigation, the convening authority will have the same two options
        outlined above. Once this sequence is completed, the convening authority will release the
        final message. DO NOT delay release of the final message or formal report for internal
        command staffing.
6.6. Notifying Person(s) Found Causal in Formal Reports. When a formal report mentions
a USAF individual (military member or civilian employee) as causal in the findings, that
individual (i.e., causal individual) will be given an opportunity to submit a witness statement
commenting on the findings. This statement is in addition to any other witness statements or
testimony provided by the individual. The statement is considered privileged safety information
and will be handled and protected IAW this instruction. Use the guidelines below to notify causal
individuals and forward their comments:
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                             69


  6.6.1. Use the memorandum in Figure 6.1. to notify the causal individual(s).
  6.6.2. Once the convening authority accepts the formal report and releases the final message,
  the convening authority will send a copy of the memorandum to the mishap unit safety
  office. Individuals must not be notified until after the SIB out briefs the convening
  authority and the final message is released. The mishap unit (wing or equivalent) Chief of
  Safety will notify the causal individual(s).
  6.6.3. The causal individual(s) may use only the final message to make additional
  comments. The individual(s) will not be allowed access to the formal report. The
  individual(s) may not remove the final message from the safety office nor copy portions of
  any of the safety reports pertaining to the mishap naming that individual causal.
  6.6.4. The individual(s) has 15 days to submit the statement back to the mishap unit (wing or
  equivalent) safety office. The individual(s) must submit a statement, though the
  statement may simply acknowledge the opportunity to comment and decline to do so.
  6.6.5. The unit (wing or equivalent) Chief of Safety will forward any statements to the
  convening authority SE and a copy to HQ AFSC for use in preparation of the MOFE.
  6.6.6. If the causal individual is attached or assigned to another MAJCOM, the convening
  authority sends a copy of the final message and the memorandum in Figure 6.1. to the
  person‘s immediate commander with a cover memorandum. Provide information copies to the
  individual‘s MAJCOM/SE. The cover memorandum should caution the commander against
  taking any disciplinary or other adverse action based upon the safety investigation and
  instruct the commander to:
     6.6.6.1. Notify the person of their opportunity to review relevant findings and to
     provide a witness statement within 15 days.
     6.6.6.2. After obtaining causal individual‘s statement forward it HQ AFSC with a
     copy to the convening authority.
  6.6.7. Notifying Non-Air Force Military Personnel and Civilians Outside Air Force
  Jurisdiction. Non-Air Force personnel are not offered the opportunity to review Air Force
  safety investigation messages or formal reports, nor to submit witness statements in these
  cases. This includes Air Force personnel serving outside the Air Force, such as with the
  Defense Logistics Agency or NATO. EXCEPTION: Those Non-Air Force personnel
  assigned to fly Air Force aircraft and afforded safety privilege IAW paragraph 3.3.3., are
  authorized to submit an witness statement as long as they still meet the previously
  mentioned criteria

                                           Chapter 7

                                   FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS

7.1. General Information. Follow-up actions start after the release of the final message. All
concerned agencies and organizations have a continuing responsibility for managing the
preventive action process. Reviewing authorities for safety reports include HQ AFSC, higher
levels in the chain of command (e.g., NAF/Center and MAJCOM), and action agencies outside
the command. For each report, the reviewing authority is tasked to assess the final message or
formal report and determine the adequacy of the overall safety report, investigation, findings,
causes, and recommendations (including OPR/OCR assignments).
7.2. Review Process. Organizations will review the final message or formal report and
send their response (Comments Message for MOFE, Table 6.2.) back to HQ AFSC. The
following organizations review the formal report:
7.2. (AFMC) Review Process. The SPM must respond to safety recommendations listed in the
final message for which their organization is listed as an OPR or OCR. The mishaps requiring
responses are listed (with a suspense date) in the center‘s list of ―Your Comments‖ in AFSAS.
   7.2.1. The convening authority, lead command of the weapons system (AFPD 10-9), and
   subordinate elements specified by the investigating MAJCOM commander.
   7.2.2. Agencies with technical or logistic support responsibility.
   7.2.3. Air Force agencies outside the investigating command if their functions were
   involved in the mishap (e.g., HQ AFFSA/XA for air traffic services and airfield
   management, DCMA for mishaps involving contracts managed by DCMA).
   7.2.4. Each MAJCOM tasked for action in the mishap recommendations. OPRs for
   recommendations may include organizations both within and external to the chain of
   command of the mishap organization. Air component commanders of unified commands if
   tasked for action.
   7.2.5. Air component commanders of unified commands when the mishap occurred during
   contingency operations. NOTE: The unified command staff offices must agree to safeguard
   the information according to rules contained in this instruction.
   7.2.6. If during the review process the convening authority or higher authority learns facts
   that were not available to safety investigators or that shed new light on the published
   findings, causes, and recommendations, he or she may do one of the following:
       7.2.6.1. Reopen the safety investigation.
       7.2.6.2. Include the new facts in the Comments Message for MOFE (Table 6.2.).
       7.2.6.3. Amend the final message with a status report if there is no formal report.
   7.2.7. Commanders at each level must take preventive actions within their areas of
   responsibility. If an investigation is inadequate or poorly documented, the convening
   authority may return the report for additional work.
72                            AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


7.3. Memorandum of Final Evaluation (MOFE). At the completion of the review process,
HQ AFSC will publish the MOFE. HQ AFSC prepares a MOFE on each formal report regardless
of mishap class. A MOFE will also be prepared for Class A and B final message reports when
the formal report is waived. Exceptions to this are detailed in discipline specific safety manuals.
     7.3.1. HQ AFSC will consider inputs from the following in preparation of the MOFE:
        7.3.1.1. Convening authority.
        7.3.1.2. Lead command of weapons system (AFPD 10-9).
        7.3.1.3. Designated action agencies.
        7.3.1.4. Commander of the mishap wing.
        7.3.1.5. Statements of person(s) found causal in the formal report.
        7.3.1.6. Unsolicited comments. Agencies and organizations reviewing the final
        message report may comment on the investigation, findings, causes, and
        recommendations even though they are neither in the chain of command nor a designated
        action agency.
     7.3.2. The MOFE is prepared by HQ AFSC and is an evaluation of the formal report/final
     message, the reviews and comments provided by the convening MAJCOM and all other
     inputs as listed in paragraph 7.3.1. The MOFE may make changes to the findings, causes,
     and recommendations (including OPR/OCR assignments).
        7.3.2.1. If the MOFE adds a person to a causal finding or significantly changes a
        person‘s role in the findings, HQ AFSC will notify the individual‘s MAJCOM and unit
        safety office and will provide the individual an opportunity to submit a witness statement,
        following the procedures in paragraph 6.6.
     7.3.3. HQ USAF/SE will transmit the MOFE to all final message report recipients. When
     transmitted, the MOFE becomes the official Air Force position on findings, causes, and
     recommendations.
7.4. Managing Recommendations Validated through the MOFE.
     7.4.1. HQ USAF/SE validates recommendations in the MOFE. Once recommendations are
     validated and assigned in the MOFE, they become a part of the system of record keeping
     mandated by public law and required of each service by DODI 6055.7.
     7.4.2. Recommendations are assigned to action agencies and given suspense dates. The
     suspense date is the date action agencies must report on completed actions or on progress
     toward completed actions. The action agency will give any identifying data to HQ AFSC to
     monitor progress of actions (paragraph 7.4.5.).
     7.4.3. HQ AFSC manages the disposition of each open recommendation until final action
     is completed. Agencies and organizations that decline to take action on SIB or HQ USAF/SE
     recommendations will provide detailed rationale to HQ AFSC. AFSAS users may track
     open recommendations and input rationale and/or status reports directly into the system.
     HQ USAF/SE will determine whether to close the recommendation or leave it open for
     future action. If the recommendation is left open, HQ USAF/SE will provide feedback to the
     applicable OPRs.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                   73


  7.4.4. The following are examples of acceptable updates toward closing actions:
     7.4.4.1. Actions planned or taken.
     7.4.4.2. Results of development or testing.
     7.4.4.3. Significant problems encountered.
     7.4.4.4. Delays experienced.
     7.4.4.5. Rationale for decision made, to include details of supporting risk analysis.
     7.4.4.6. Concurrence and non-concurrence by other agencies.
  7.4.5. The following examples are acceptable closing actions:
     7.4.5.1. Recommended changes to all applicable publications were issued.
     7.4.5.2. Recommended modifications to all applicable systems or items were completed.
     7.4.5.3. Recommended studies or evaluations were completed, conclusions were
     validated, and actions on all validated requirements were completed. In these cases,
     the OPR shall include detailed rationale, to include a risk analysis, to support their
     conclusions.
     7.4.5.4. Recommended actions were determined not feasible due to cost, operational
     constraints, or programmed removal of the system or item from service.
  7.4.6. Follow Up Actions for Publication Recommendations. MAJCOM/SE will brief and
  advocate for SIB recommendations at the flight manual and technical order review boards.
  For Class A and B mishaps, if recommended changes are disapproved by the flight manual
  or technical order review boards, MAJCOM/SE will ensure the appropriate directorate
  (DO/LG) is aware of the disapproval and concurs with the review board‘s action. Forward
  copies of completed changes to AFSC/SEFM for AF/SE review.
  7.4.7. MAJCOM/DRU/FOA/ANG will establish a Mishap Review Panel (MRP) or
  equivalent process (e.g., Materiel Safety Task Group or System Safety Group) for all
  safety disciplines to ensure mishap recommendations are methodically addressed. The
  MRP or similar process will meet once every six months. A consolidated recommendation
  status report is due to HQ AFSC on 15 Nov and 15 May every year. The report will be
  compiled using data as of 30 Sep and 30 Mar each year (end of FY and end of second quarter).
  This report will cover all disciplines. This report is a way of ensuring these responsibilities are
  completed. It also advises all parties of the status of open recommendations.
  7.4.7. (AFMC) AFMC uses Materiel Safety Task Groups (MSTG) to manage open
  materiel safety recommendations for which an AFMC center is an OPR or OCR. MSTGs
  provide input to SPMs to improve the safety of their products by ensuring adequate and
  timely actions are taken to correct open materiel safety recommendations. MSTGs develop
  and review responses to open safety recommendations, and monitor responses to related
  recommendations. MSTGs ensure lessons learned are appropriately exchanged.
     7.4.7.1. (Added-AFMC) Required members of an MSTG are:
74                        AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


        7.4.7.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Chairperson. The Chairperson will be the wing
        commander/director. The wing commander/director may designate an alternate
        chairperson.
        7.4.7.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Assistant Chairperson. The MSPM is the Assistant
        Chairperson and also serves as the MSTG executive.
        7.4.7.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Program          representatives      (Program      Managers,
        Engineers, Equipment Specialists, etc.).
        7.4.7.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Rated officers. Rated officers for the involved weapon
        system attend meetings to provide operational expertise.
        7.4.7.1.5. (Added-AFMC) Safety Office representatives.
        7.4.7.1.6. (Added-AFMC) Laboratory representatives, where applicable.
        7.4.7.1.7. (Added-AFMC) Maintenance representatives, where applicable.
        7.4.7.1.8. (Added-AFMC) Others, as necessary. Contractor representatives may be
        invited to discuss technical aspects of their equipment, but will not be present during
        decision making or when privileged information is shown or discussed.
     7.4.7.2. (Added-AFMC) AFSAS is the primary Air Force mishap database and will be
     updated with the actions taken/current status of each open safety recommendation at
     least semi-annually. These updates are available to USAF/SE and other MAJCOM
     AFSAS users. HQ AFMC/SE‘s Materiel Safety Database (DB10) has been used in the
     past to track the status of materiel safety recommendations for which AFMC‘s Centers
     are an OPR/OCR. New mishaps (mishaps that occur after the date of this publication)
     will not be entered into DB10 since they are all in AFSAS. DB10 will be maintained as a
     historical database.
     7.4.7.3. (Added-AFMC) Updates to open safety recommendations in AFSAS and
     DB10 will include an evaluation (Concur, Nonconcur, or Concur with intent), date of
     the update, action taken, estimated completion date (ECD), and POC/Office
     Symbol/DSN.
     7.4.7.4. (Added-AFMC) Do not request closure for open safety recommendations
     until all actions are complete. Open safety recommendations pending continuing action
     (extended PDM scheduling, TCTO in progress, document awaiting publication, etc.) need
     not be reviewed at every MSTG. However, recommendations tracking TCTO
     accomplishment must be updated in February and August. All other open safety
     recommendations will be updated at least semi-annually, to satisfy USAF/SE‘s semi-
     annual (March and September) review of open safety recommendations.
     7.4.7.5. (Added-AFMC) When a SPM "nonconcurs" on a Class A or B open materiel
     safety recommendation for which they are the OPR or OCR, the Center/CC will be
     the final reviewing authority. The SPM will coordinate nonconcurrence staff
     packages through the center safety office and the center commander for approval. The
     nonconcurrence text should be succinct and include feasible alternatives, if available,
     or rationale for nonconcurrence. Upon center commander approval, submit the center
     commander position via AFSAS.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                75


           7.4.7.5.1. (Added-AFMC) When the SPM concurs, put "CONCUR" in the
           appropriate field of the safety record. Identify who made the update. Provide an
           Estimated Completion Date (ECD).
           7.4.7.5.2. (Added-AFMC) When the SPM nonconcurs, put "NONCONCUR" in
           the appropriate field of the safety record. Provide solid rationale for the
           nonconcurrence. Identify who made the update.
7.5. Managing All Other Recommendations. HQ AFSC does not normally prepare a MOFE
for Class C and D mishaps without a formal report, and Class E events. MAJCOMs will
establish an internal program to effectively manage final disposition of recommendations and
ORSs resulting from these mishaps and events. Class A and B ORSs will be managed IAW the

LOST TIME CASE—(Class C)—Any injury or occupational illness or disease that causes loss
of one or more days away from work beyond the day or shift it occurred. When determining if
the mishap is a Lost Time Case, you must count the number of days the employee was unable to
work as a result of the injury or illness, regardless of whether or not the person was scheduled to
work on those days. Weekend days, holidays, vacation days, or other days off are included in the
total number of day‘s loss, if the employee would not have been able to work on those days.
Don‘t count the day of the injury/illness or the day the individual returns to work. Occurrences
that result from voluntary participation in wellness and fitness programs, or recreational
activities such as exercise class, racquetball, or baseball or injuries or illnesses resulting from an
employee eating, drinking, or preparing food for personnel consumption will be reported to
comply with Department of Defense mandates
MISCELLANEOUS MISHAP—A ground and industrial mishap that is on- or off-duty and
does not fit into the industrial or sport and recreational subcategory. Also included in this
subcategory are reportable mishaps occurring while using a commercial carrier such as a

NATURAL PHENOMENA MISHAP—(DELETED).
NATURAL PHENOMENA RELATED—Injury to persons or damage to DoD property
resulting from wildlife or environmental conditions of such a magnitude that they could not have
been predicted or prepared for or for which all reasonable preparations had been taken. Do not
report incidents that are natural phenomena related where adequate preparation, forecasting, and
communication actions were taken and there were no injuries. However, report military and
civilian injuries resulting from these mishaps as ground and industrial mishaps. NOTE: Natural
phenomena mishaps are categorized as industrial mishaps.
NO LOST TIME CASE—(Class D)— Any injury or occupational illness or disease that
restricts work activities and does not meet the definition of Lost Time. These are cases where,
because of injury or occupational illness or disease, Air Force personnel only work partial days,
restricted work or were transferred to another job, required medical treatment greater than first
aid, loss of consciousness, or a significant injury or illness/disease diagnosed by a physician or
other licensed health care professional, even if it does not result in death, days away from work,
restricted work or job transfer, medical treatment greater then first aid, or loss of consciousness.
NOTE: Occurrences that result from voluntary participation in wellness and fitness programs, or

AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                89


OFF-DUTY MILITARY RELATED—A fatality or injury to off-duty DOD military personnel
whether or not on a DOD installation, excluding private motor vehicle (PMV) mishaps. NOTE:
A mishap involving on- and off-duty military personnel in the same mishap will be categorized
as an on-duty mishap.
ON-DUTY—DOD personnel are on-duty when: Physically present at any location where they
are to perform their officially assigned work. Officially assigned work includes organization-
sponsored events an employee is permitted to attend, regardless of location. This includes those
activities incident to normal work activities that occur on DOD installations, such as lunch,
coffee, or rest breaks, and all activities aboard military vessels. NOTE: Personnel walking to and
from work place parking areas at the start and end of the duty day are in an on-duty status.
Personnel who eat lunch and then deviate from normal lunch activities (example shopping) are
considered off-duty.
 Being transported by DOD or commercial conveyance to perform officially assigned work.
 (This includes travel in PMVs or commercial conveyances while performing official duty, but
 not routine travel to and from work).
 On temporary duty, Personnel on assignment away from the regular place of employment are
 covered 24 hours a day for any injury or occupational illness that results from activities
 essential or incidental to the temporary assignment. Essential or incidental activities include
 travel between places of business or lodging and eating establishments, drugstores,
 barbershops, places of worship, cleaning establishments, bowling centers, officer and enlisted
 clubs, gymnasiums, and similar on-base non-appropriated fund (NAF) facilities and similar
 places required for the health or comfort of the member, are considered on-duty. However,
 when personnel deviate from the normal incidents of the trip and become involved in activities,
 personal or otherwise, that are not reasonably incidental to the duties of the temporary
 assignment contemplated by the employer, the person ceases to be considered onduty for
 investigation and reporting purposes of injuries or occupational illnesses. Injuries or
 occupational illnesses to personnel resulting from activities unrelated to the temporary duty
 assignment or non-commander directed sports and recreation activities (e.g. jogging, golfing,
 basketball) will be reported as off-duty mishaps.
 Taking part in compulsory physical fitness training, sporting events, and physical fitness
 evaluation activities (including cycle ergometric testing when permitted). On-duty compulsory
 fitness training and activities include directed sports activities at professional military
 education (PME) and formal training courses such as Basic Military Training, Technical
 Training Schools, Airman Leadership School, Squadron Officer School, and the Air Force
 Academy. These activities are considered on-duty when a superior directs participation at a
 specific location and time. This includes supervision directed physical conditioning activities
 when a mandatory location and time are designated. Air Force civilian employees authorized
 to participate in physical fitness activities during normal duty hours are also on-duty.

 Military members working part-time Non-appropriated Fund (NAF) positions. NOTE: Use the
 NAF position series (instead of the military Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) for safety
 reporting NOTE: The definitions above are for mishap reporting purposes only and are not
 related to compensability or line-of-duty determination.

person to the extent that he or she cannot follow any gainful occupation and results in a medical
discharge, retirement, separation. The loss, or the loss of use of both hands, both feet, both eyes,
or a combination of any of those body parts as a result of a single mishap will be considered as a
permanent total disability. For purposes of this instruction, any mishap resulting in injury severe
enough for an individual to be in a non-medically induced coma is a permanent total disability.
(NOTE: Upgrade injury to a fatal mishap if death occurs within 30 days of medical discharge,
retirement, or separation from service due to complications arising from the mishap injury).
SPORT AND RECREATION MISAHP—Mishaps involving injuries that occur during
participation in some form of recreational or athletic activities whether on- or off-duty. The
activity may be for leisure, designed to develop an Air Force member ‘s physical ability or to
maintain or increase individual/collective combat and/or peacekeeping skills (See TRAINING
RELATED DEATH).
(AFMC) Materiel Recommendations—Safety recommendations addressing AFMC managed
equipment/ hardware and TO‘s.
(AFMC) Materiel Safety—The management of materiel safety recommendations. This includes
actions taken to ensure the timely identification and correction of deficiencies occurring in parts
or processes, which pose a hazard to the safe operation of weapon systems or support equipment.

        IC 2006-1 TO AFI 91-204, SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS AND REPORTS

 14 FEBRUARY 2006
 SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change incorporates Interim Change 2006-1 and reflects DoDI 6055.7 guidance regarding
mishap categories. It also provides additional information on how to classify and record
injuries. It provides additional guidance for compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 and
handling of privileged information. It updates Table 6.2. Reporting and Briefing Schedule, and
updates the use of some AF Forms. Finally, it clarifies the definitions of some terms in
Attachment 1. The entire text of the IC is at the last attachment. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision
from the previous edition.
1.1.2. Legal investigations provide a publicly releasable report of the facts and circumstances
surrounding a mishap. Legal investigations may include a statement of opinion on the cause of
the accident, gather and preserve evidence for claims, litigation, disciplinary and adverse
administrative actions, and for all other purposes. An Accident Investigation Board (AIB) is
one type of legal investigation and is convened for many space, aircraft, unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV), and missile mishaps IAW AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations. A
Commander Directed Investigation (CDI) is another type of legal investigation that may be
convened for mishaps.
1.5. Accounting for Losses. The Air Force records each mishap to the command (MAJCOM)
that experienced the loss of an owned asset (personnel or property). For statistical purposes,
the occurrence is recorded as a mishap in that command (or in the Air Force at large, when
applicable) regardless of any determination as to the responsibility for the mishap. Generally,
the mishap is recorded in the command that has investigative responsibility for the mishap
(Chapter 4). Mishap accounting in no way implies blame or mishap responsibility. NOTE:
For purposes of this instruction, the term "MAJCOM" includes ANG, DRUs, and FOAs.
1.6. Mishap Categories. The Air Force categorizes mishaps based upon the materiel involved
(e.g., space systems, weapons, aircraft, motor vehicles, person, etc.) and the state of the
involved materiel (e.g., launch, orbit, existence of intent for flight, on- or off-duty, etc.) when
the mishap occurs. Mishap categories and subcategories are defined below and diagramed in
Figure 1.1. For the purposes of reporting and data collection, select the one category and
subcategory that best defines the mishap under investigation. Normally mishaps involve only
one category and subcategory, see paragraph 1.6.3.
1.6.1.3.3. Aircraft Ground Operations Mishap. A mishap involving DoD aircraft, with an
aircrew member on board, that occurs between engine start/shutdown and prior to/following
intent for flight that results in reportable property damage or any injury or fatality. Damage to a
missile prior to the completion of weapons upload procedures, or after initiation of weapons
download procedures is a Missile mishap. Note: The three key factors required to meet the
AGO category are: Aircrew member on board, Engines running, and intention to become
airborne at some point.
 1.6.1.9. (DELETED).
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                               101


1.6.1.9.1. (DELETED).
1.6.1.9.2. (DELETED).

1.6.1.10. Ground and Industrial. An Air Force mishap that occurs to on-duty DoD civilian and
on- or off-duty DoD military personnel and does not meet the mishap category definition of
nuclear, space, aviation, guided missile, explosives and chemical agents, directed energy, afloat,
or motor vehicle as defined by this instruction. NOTE: A mishap involving both on- and off-
duty military personnel is categorized as an on-duty mishap. This category also includes old
ground mishaps categories such as fire, combat training, physical and Athletic Conditioning,
contractor, and Natural Phenomena. These have been replaced with questions in AFSAS.
1.6.1.10.1. (DELETED).
1.6.1.10.2. (DELETED).
1.6.1.10.3. Sports and Recreational. Mishaps involving injuries that occur during participation
in some form of recreational or athletic activities whether on- or off-duty. The activity may be
for leisure, designed to develop an Air Force member‘s physical ability or to maintain or
increase individual/collective combat and/or peacekeeping skills (see Training Related Death,
Attachment 1).
1.6.1.10.4. (DELETED).
1.6.1.10.5. (DELETED).
1.6.1.10.6. (DELETED).
1.6.1.10.7. (DELETED).
1.6.1.10.8. (DELETED).
1.6.1.10.9. Industrial. A ground and industrial mishap that occurs in the work environment
that does not meet the mishap subcategory definition of sport and recreational or
miscellaneous as defined by this instruction. This also include categories for fire, combat
training, physical and Athletic Conditioning, Contractor, and Natural Phenomena. (The work
environment, as defined in 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1960, is ―The establishment and
other locations where one or more Air Force employees are working or are present as a
condition of their employment; this would include those areas or locations where persons are
TDY for training purposes. The work environment includes not only physical locations, but
also the equipment or materials used by the employee during the course of his or her work).
1.6.1.10.10. Miscellaneous. On- or off-duty mishaps that do not fit into the industrial, sports
and recreational subcategory. Also included in this subcategory are reportable mishaps
occurring while using a commercial carrier such as a commercial bus, airplane, or taxicab.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 25 JULY 2007   101
  Figure 1.1. Mishap Categories
1.8.3.2. Any injury or occupational illness or disease that causes loss of one or more days away
from work beyond the day or shift it occurred. When determining if the mishap is a Lost Time
Case, you must count the number of days the employee was unable to work as a result of the
injury or illness, regardless of whether or not the person was scheduled to work on those days.
Weekend days, holidays, vacation days, or other days off are included in the total number of
days, if the employee would not have been able to work on those days. NOTE: Occurrences
that result from voluntary participation in wellness and fitness programs, or recreational
activities such as exercise class, racquetball, or baseball or injuries or illnesses resulting from
an employee eating, drinking, or preparing food for personnel consumption will be reported as
on or off-duty mishaps to comply with DODI 6055.7 Department of Defense mandates.
1.8.4. Class D Mishap. Class D Mishap. Any nonfatal injury or occupational illness that does
not meet the definition of Lost Time. These are cases where, because of injury or occupational
illness, Air Force personnel only works partial days, restricted work or were transferred to
another job, required medical treatment greater than first aid, lost of consciousness, or a
significant injury or illness diagnosed by a physician or other licensed health care professional,
even if it does not result in death, days away from work, restricted work or job transfer,
medical treatment greater then first aid, or loss of consciousness. NOTE: Occurrences that
result from voluntary participation in wellness and fitness programs, or recreational activities
such as exercise class, racquetball, or baseball or injuries or illnesses resulting from an
employee eating, drinking, or preparing food for personnel consumption will be reported to
comply with DODI 6055.7 Department of Defense mandates.
1.8.4.1. (DELETED).
1.8.4.2. (DELETED).
1.8.5.4. Property Damage Events (Non Aviation). Mishaps that do not have an injury or
illness and the direct cost is totaling $2,000 or more but less than $20,000.
1.8.5.5. Other occurrences as directed in the discipline specific safety manuals (AFMAN 91-
22X).
1.9.1.1.1. Material Cost. If an item is repairable locally by unit personnel, calculate the cost of
the materials used to repair the item. When determining the cost of Class I ODS use the value of
$100.00 per pound for the inadvertent release of Class I ODSs.
1.10. Mishap Injury and Occupational Illnesses. Report the type of person (1.10.1.) and the
severity of injury/occupational illness (1.10.2.).
1.11. Recording Injuries and Occupational Illnesses. Use the OSHA Form 300, Log of
Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses, for recording injuries and occupational illnesses to
civilian and military personnel meeting Class A, B, C, or D criteria. See AFMAN 91-224,
Chapter 6, for specific guidance. Note. Use separate logs (OSHA 301) to record military and
civilian personnel. Contractor personnel who are supervised on a daily basis by Air Force
personnel may be required to record their own injuries/illness.
3.2.1.5. Any Life Science Materiel, including photographs with markings or other indicators
that contain analysis by a safety investigator. For example, 72-hour histories, 14-day histories,
and interview narratives obtained during the post-mishap physical examination.
104                         AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006


3.2.4. Privileged Safety Information and Safety Reports. Safety reports are for official use
only (FOUO) if they are not classified. However, not each document in the report is FOUO.
The factual documents in Part 1 of formal safety reports are not considered FOUO by this
AFI, and should not be marked as such. However, documents from other sources included in
Part 1 may already be marked FOUO. Only the OPR for the document may remove FOUO
markings.
3.2.5.4. Persons Authorized to Make Promises of Confidentiality. Only members of a
designated ISB/SIB (or a SIO) may offer promises of confidentiality and only during safety
investigations where promises of confidentiality are authorized. When conducting safety
investigations in which promises of confidentiality are authorized, the safety investigators
have the discretion to decide who will be offered a promise of confidentiality. The
investigators‘ decision should be based upon a witness or contractor‘s reluctance to cooperate,
involvement in the mishap sequence, or apparent self-interest in not disclosing information.
Promises of confidentiality will only be given as needed to ensure forthright cooperation of
the witness and may not be given on a blanket basis to all witnesses.
3.3.1. Sanitizing Privileged Safety Reports. Sanitizing reports or extracts from reports means
obscuring the relationship between the identity of a mishap and the findings, conclusions,
causes, recommendations, deliberative processes resulting from the investigation, and
statements made under a promise of confidentiality. Wing safety officers or their designated
representatives (that are properly trained) may sanitize privileged safety reports and other
media for unit use and for use by authorized contractor personnel. Some mishaps, because of
widespread publicity or unique circumstances, cannot be fully sanitized. When a report is
sanitized, the findings, causes, recommendation, conclusions, or opinions of the investigation
are no longer privileged. (Note: Sanitized reports are not necessarily releasable to the public
since they may still contain information protected by the Privacy Act, Arms Export Control
Act, or Export Administration Act. Ensure sanitized reports are appropriately labeled.)
Sanitizing a report involves separating the following identifying information from related safety
investigator findings, causes, recommendations, conclusions, or opinions:
 3.3.1.6. Do not release statements or contractor reports obtained with a promise of
 confidentiality.
3.3.2. Limiting Use or Release within the Air Force. Safety officers and their staffs, duly
appointed safety investigators, AFSC personnel and AF/SE and his staff, are authorized access
to and use of privileged safety information based on their safety duties. Other Air Force
officials, when their duties include mishap prevention and when it is necessary to develop,
take, or review preventive actions, may obtain access to privileged safety information. See
paragraphs 3.2.2., 3.2.3., and 3.3. MAJCOM, NAF/Center or unit Chiefs of Safety are
authorized, when sanitized information is inadequate, to provide privileged safety information
as lessons learned to Air Force members on a need-to-know basis and solely for mishap
prevention. They will ensure members are instructed on properly protecting information and
their responsibilities to prevent further, unauthorized release. Lessons learned will not include
confidential statements or contractor reports.
3.3.2.1. AF/SE; AFSC/CD and division chiefs; MAJCOM, NAF/Center or unit Chiefs of
Safety; SIB presidents or SIOs; are authorized to disclose privileged safety information to AF
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                105


officials as described in 3.3.2.
3.3.2.4. (DELETED).
3.3.3. Limiting Release Outside the Air Force. In certain cases, the Air Force has agreed to
exchange privileged safety information with other DOD agencies solely for mishap prevention
purposes. Also, the Air Force shares certain mishap prevention information with other entities
in the interests of the general safety community. See paragraphs 3.2.2., 3.2.3., and 3.3.
3.3.3.3. Historical Safety Reports. HQ USAF/SE/SED may release the findings of a Safety
Board, contained in historical safety reports prepared IAW DODI 6055.7 (or its predecessors),
provided no national defense or safety interest exists. For the purpose of this provision,
historical reports shall be defined as those concerning mishaps more than 25 years old. (Note:
Safety Reports on pre-1956 mishaps are not protected by the safety privilege and are stored at
the Air Force Historical Research Agency, Maxwell AFB.)
3.3.3.5. Limiting Release to Contractors. Contractors may need access to privileged safety
information when they are performing an Air Force function involving mishap prevention.
Contractors may also need access to privileged safety information if they designed, built,
maintained or operated Air Force weapon systems, their components, or other Air Force
equipment, in order to correct defects or other problems and help prevent future mishaps.
When contractors need access to privileged safety information, the appropriate memorandum
in Figure A3.6. or Figure A3.7. must be used and kept on file with the individual authorizing
access to the information. Access will be limited to what is needed to prevent future mishaps.
Contractors will not release the information outside contractor safety channels; for example,
privileged safety information will not be released to the general counsel‘s office or public
relations personnel. The number of contractor employees who have access to the information
shall be strictly limited to only those individuals who have a need to know the information in
order to enhance the safety of the Air Force weapon systems. After a project is complete,
contractors will not maintain the information in their files. Contractors must understand and
agree to their responsibilities to treat such information as confidential. See paragraphs 3.2.2.,
3.2.3., and 3.3.
3.3.3.5.1. Contractors who built, designed, or maintained equipment involved in mishaps send
representatives to support Air Force SIBs at the request of the Air Force. SIB presidents and
safety investigators will ensure those representatives understand that the Air Force may, at the
contractor‘s request, extend a claim of privilege over documents provided by the contractor
representatives to the SIB when the Air Force maintains sole possession or control. A claim of
privilege may not be sustained over notes, documents, and other matter produced during the
SIB investigation by the contractor but retained by the contractor representatives. SIB
presidents grant these contractors access to privileged safety information only if it is essential
to assist the SIB.
3.3.3.5.2. Contractors providing weapon system maintenance support are performing an Air
Force function. Advise them that disclosure of privileged safety information is necessary for

INDUSTRIAL SPACE MISHAP—(DELETED).

INDUSTRIAL WEAPONS MISHAP—(DELETED).

 LOST TIME CASE (Class C)—Any injury or occupational illness or disease that causes loss
 of one or more days away from work beyond the day or shift it occurred. When determining if
 the mishap is a Lost Time Case, you must count the number of days the employee was unable
 to work as a result of the injury or illness, regardless of whether or not the person was
 scheduled to work on those days. Weekend days, holidays, vacation days, or other days off are
 included in the total number of day‘s loss, if the employee would not have been able to work
 on those days. Don‘t count the day of the injury/illness or the day the individual returns to
 work. NOTE: Occurrences that result from voluntary participation in wellness and fitness
 programs, or recreational activities such as exercise class, racquetball, or baseball or injuries or
 illnesses resulting from an employee eating, drinking, or preparing food for personnel
 consumption will be reported to comply with Department of Defense mandates.

MISCELLANEOUS MISHAP—A ground and industrial mishap that is on or off-duty and
does not fit into the industrial or sport and recreational subcategory. Also included in this
subcategory are reportable mishaps occurring while using a commercial carrier such as a
commercial bus, airplane, or taxicab.

 MISHAP—A mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in
 damage or injury and meets Class A, B, C, D and E mishap reporting criteria IAW paragraph

NATURAL PHENOMENA MISHAP—(DELETED).

NATURAL PHENOMENA RELATED—Injury to persons or damage to DoD property
resulting from wildlife or environmental conditions of such a magnitude that they could not
have been predicted or prepared for or for which all reasonable preparations had been taken.
Do not report incidents that are natural phenomena related where adequate preparation,
forecasting, and communication actions were taken and there were no injuries. However,
report military and civilian injuries resulting from these mishaps as ground and industrial
mishaps. NOTE: Natural phenomena mishaps are categorized as industrial mishaps.
AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006                                                113


NO LOST TIME CASE (Class D)—Any injury or occupational illness or disease that
restricts work activities and does not meet the definition of Lost Time. These are cases where,
because of injury or occupational illness or disease, Air Force personnel only work partial
days, restricted work or were transferred to another job, required medical treatment greater

or were diagnosed as having an occupational illness.
OFF-DUTY MILITARY RELATED—A fatality or injury to off-duty DOD military
personnel whether or not on a DOD installation, excluding private motor vehicle (PMV)
mishaps. NOTE: A mishap involving on- and off-duty military personnel in the same mishap
will be categorized as an on-duty mishap.

ON-DUTY—DOD personnel are on-duty when: Physically present at any location where they
are to perform their officially assigned work. Officially assigned work includes organization-
sponsored events an employee is permitted to attend, regardless of location. This includes
those activities incident to normal work activities that occur on DOD installations, such as
lunch, coffee, or rest breaks, and all activities aboard military vessels. NOTE: Personnel
walking to and from work place parking areas at the start and end of the duty day are in an on-
duty status. Personnel who eat lunch and then deviate from normal lunch activities (example
shopping) are considered off-duty.

barbershops, places of worship, cleaning establishments, bowling centers, officer and enlisted
clubs, gymnasiums, and similar on-base non-appropriated fund (NAF) facilities and similar
places required for the health or comfort of the member, are considered on-duty. However,
when personnel deviate from the normal incidents of the trip and become involved in activities,
personal or otherwise, that are not reasonably incidental to the duties of the temporary
assignment contemplated by the employer, the person ceases to be considered on-duty for
investigation and reporting purposes of injuries or occupational illnesses. Injuries or
occupational illnesses to personnel resulting from activities unrelated to the temporary duty
assignment or non-commander directed sports and recreation activities (e.g. jogging, golfing,
114                           AFI91-204_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP_I 14 FEBRUARY 2006

fitness training and activities include directed sports activities at professional military
education (PME) and formal training courses such as Basic Military Training, Technical
Training Schools, Airman Leadership School, Squadron Officer School, and the Air Force
Academy. These activities are considered on-duty when a superior directs participation at a
specific location and time. This includes supervision directed physical conditioning activities
when a mandatory location and time are designated. Air Force civilian employees authorized
to participate in physical fitness activities during normal duty hours are also on-duty.
Military members working part-time Non-appropriated Fund (NAF) positions. NOTE: Use the
NAF position series (instead of the military Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) for safety
reporting
NOTE: The definitions above are for mishap reporting purposes only and are not related to
compensability or line-of-duty determination.

 PERMANENT PARTIAL DISABILITY—(Class B) An injury or occupational illness that

 involvement; repairable inguinal hernia; disfigurement; sprains or strains that do not cause
 permanent limitation of motion.
 PERMANENT TOTAL DISABILITY—(Class A) Any nonfatal injury or occupational
 illness that, in the opinion of competent medical authority, permanently and totally
 incapacitates a person to the extent that he or she cannot follow any gainful occupation and
 results in a medical discharge, retirement, separation. The loss, or the loss of use of both hands,
 both feet, both eyes, or a combination of any of those body parts as a result of a single mishap
 will be considered as a permanent total disability. For purposes of this instruction, any mishap
 resulting in injury severe enough for an individual to be in a non-medically induced coma is a
 permanent total disability. (NOTE: Upgrade injury to a fatal mishap if death occurs within 30
 days of medical discharge, retirement, or separation from service due to complications arising
 from the mishap injury).
