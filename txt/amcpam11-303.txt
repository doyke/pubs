This pamphlet is designed to clarify the process to access the aeromedical evacuation (AE) system for
U.S. military personnel in deployed locations. The focus is on ensuring access for personnel who may be
in austere or bare-base environments, although it may also be used by embassy staff or other personnel
requiring access to the AE system. Focal points of contact are outlined for Pacific Command, Southern
Command, European Command, and Central Command areas of operation. Special patient preparation
considerations and the necessary information to convey to the patient movement requirements center
(PMRC) have been outlined for the user. This pamphlet is applicable to all Services and Reserve Compo-
nents.



1. Introduction.
   1.1. This pamphlet is intended to facilitate the movement of patients from austere and bare-base
   deployed locations and from countries where military medical facilities may not be available. Air
   Mobility Command (AMC) is designated the lead command for AE. The AE system uses fixed-wing
   aircraft to move patients and can be used in conjunction with other evacuation systems, such as casu-
   alty evacuation (CASEVAC) and medical evacuation (MEDEVAC - Army rotary-wing) when avail-
   able.
   1.2. The information contained in this pamphlet provides a simplified method for accessing the AE
   system, as well as covering some patient and equipment considerations. Finally, the updated listing of
   telephone numbers will facilitate easier access worldwide.
   1.3. Definition of AE: The movement of patients by air transportation in fixed-wing aircraft, under
   the supervision of aeromedical evacuation crews, to and between medical treatment facilities.
   1.4. Capabilities of the AE system:
       1.4.1. Control of patient movement by fixed wing aircraft.
       1.4.2. Specialized medical aircrew and augmentees.
2                                                               AMCPAM11-303 3 NOVEMBER 2000

       1.4.3. Certified in-flight medical equipment.
       1.4.4. Facilities located on or near air strips and air bases with limited medical care for patients in
       transit.
       1.4.5. Communication network with en route medical facilities concerning patient transportation.

2. Access Process and Telephone Numbers.
    2.1. For patient movement assistance within CONUS or USSOUTHCOM, contact the Global Patient
    Movement Requirements Center (GPMRC) at DSN 779-6241 or commercial (618) 229-6241 or
    1-800-874-8966 (24-hour number). The GPMRC will obtain patient information, medically and
    administratively validate the requirement, determine destination options, and coordinate with the
    appropriate service component who then executes the patient movement mission.
    2.2. If unable to contact the GPMRC, contact the Tanker Airlift Control Center AE Cell (TACC/
    XOGA) at DSN 779-1913 or commercial (618) 229-1913 (24-hour number). The TACC can also be
    reached at 1-800 AIR MOBL (also a 24-hour number). Ask to speak to someone in the AE Cell and
    explain that GPMRC was not contacted. The TACC AE Cell is responsible for the tasking, scheduling,
    execution, flight following, and recovery of AE missions. Once TACC has been contacted, a coordi-
    nated effort will begin to initiate procedures to obtain aircrews, equipment and aircraft.
    2.3. Telephone numbers for the Theater Patient Movement Centers (TPMRC), which are located in
    Germany and Japan, are listed below. The function of the TPMRC basically mirrors the function of
    the GPMRC for patient movement within their respective theaters. They coordinate with the GPMRC
    and TACC for intertheater AE mission coordination and execution.
    2.4. The TPMRC â€“ Europe (TPMRC-E), located at Ramstein AB, Germany, communicates and coor-
    dinates patient movement requirements for USEUCOM (Europe/parts of Africa) and USCENTCOM
    (parts of Asia and Africa).
       2.4.1. DSN 314-480-2264 or 8040; commercial 011-49-6371-47-2264 or 8040.
    2.5. The TPMRC - PACOM, located at Yokota AB, Japan, communicates and coordinates patient
    movement requirements for their area of responsibility throughout Asia and the Pacific.
       2.5.1. DSN 315-225-4700 or 4857; commercial 011-81-311-755-4700/4857
    2.6. In austere conditions, any medical or AE element; AE liaison team (AELT), mobile aeromedical
    staging facility (MASF), or AE crew member may be contacted for assistance.

3. Equipment And Supply Considerations.
    3.1. Several issues need to be taken into consideration when requesting aeromedical evacuation. The
    most important issue to ensure accurate, clear information is conveyed to the individual arranging the
    aeromedical evacuation mission. Let the patient movement clinical coordinator (PMCC) at the
    TPMRC or GPMRC know if:
       3.1.1. You feel that a specific piece of equipment might be needed.
       3.1.2. You want to swap equipment, or if you want to keep your own equipment.
       3.1.3. The patient is on the only litter that you have and you want to retain the litter.
    3.2. Equipment
AMCPAM11-303 3 NOVEMBER 2000                                                                              3

   3.3. The following equipment is carried on routine aeromedical evacuation mission (AFI 41-301,
   Worldwide Aeromedical Evacuation System):
       3.3.1. Life-Pak 10, Cardiac Monitor and Defibrillator.
       3.3.2. Life-Pak 10 Battery Support System.
       3.3.3. Portable suction unit.
       3.3.4. Pulse oximeter.
       3.3.5. PT-LOX (10 liters of liquid oxygen per unit, 1 liter =804 gaseous), used if the aircraft being
       used does not have integral oxygen capability.
       3.3.6. Frequency converter (for aircraft that do not deliver a 115 VAC/60HZ power source).
       3.3.7. IV infusion pump.
       3.3.8. Electrical cable assembly set (extension cords to access electrical power source).
       3.3.9. Ambu-bags.
       3.3.10. Intubation kit.
       3.3.11. Emergency medications.
       3.3.12. (ACLS) medication and equipment.
 NOTE: Air Force AE squadrons only use in-flight medical equipment that has been approved by the
Armstrong Laboratory for use in the AE system. If other equipment is necessary, let the PMCC know.
Ventilators, backboards, traction devices or Stryker frame, decompression masks, chest tubes and drain-
age kits are available if required and adequate time is available for mission preparation.
   3.4. Supplies.
       3.4.1. Standardized inflight kits are available on each aeromedical evacuation mission. They
       include IV supplies, oxygen equipment, irrigation fluids, dressing supplies, Foley catheters, NG
       tubes, and very limited splint and immobilization supplies.
       3.4.2. If additional supplies are needed, inform the PMCC at the PMRC. Additional supplies may
       include: burn packs, additional IV fluids, additional immobilization devices, cervical collars, and/
       or expansion of the ACLS/ATLS medications, narcotics, and equipment.

4. Patient Considerations.
   4.1. The following are patient considerations and categories that should be used to inform the PMCC
   of the patient(s) status.
   4.2. Patient Category:
       4.2.1. Psychiatric.
       4.2.2. Inpatient Litter.
       4.2.3. Ambulatory patient.
       4.2.4. Infant.
       4.2.5. Outpatient.

       4.2.6. Attendant.
    4.3. Patient Movement Precedence (JP 4-02.2, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Patient
    Movement in Joint Operation):
       4.3.1. Urgent: Immediate movement to save life, limb, or eyesight (movement as soon as possi-
       ble).
       4.3.2. Priority: Patients requiring prompt medical care not available locally, used when the medi-
       cal condition could deteriorate and the patient cannot wait for routine evacuation (movement
       within 24 hours).
       4.3.3. Routine: Patient requires medical evacuation, but their condition is not expected to deterio-
       rate significantly (movement within 72 hours)
 NOTE: Relay any unusual circumstances or requirements needed to send this patient to a particular des-
tination. The PMCC will respond accordingly.
    4.4. Patient Information (See Attachment 2)
    4.5. The following is not intended to direct how patient care is administered. These are simply some
    considerations. When communicating with the PMCC, have as much of the patient information
    readily available as possible and be brief:
       4.5.1. Why the patient is being evacuated, i.e. what is clinically/medically wrong with the
       patient?
       4.5.2. Brief synopsis of current history, if known.
       4.5.3. Past significant medical history, including allergies. If none, state so.
       4.5.4. Current knowledge of patient medications, if known, include available documentation. If
       none, state so.
    4.6. Patient Preparation/Documentation:
       4.6.1. Document on one of the following forms, if available:
           4.6.1.1. AF Form 3899, AE Patient Record
           4.6.1.2. DD Form 1380, US Medical Card
           4.6.1.3. DD Form 600, Chronological Record of Medical Care
           4.6.1.4. DD Form 602, Patient Evacuation Tag or AF Form 3899, AE Patient Record
           4.6.1.5. Any other available clinical documentation format

5. Preflight Considerations.
    5.1. Weapons and Ammunition
       5.1.1. It must be understood that weapons and ammunition will be an issue for the AE crew when
       trying to get patients onto the aircraft. The easiest way to avoid controversy with the AE crew and
       the other aircrew members is to anti-hijack the individual. To accomplish this, do the following:
           5.1.1.1. Separate the ammunition from the weapon. The loadmaster (if there is no loadmaster,
           check with the Aircraft Commander, or Flying Crew Chief) will secure the ammunition. Make
AMCPAM11-303 3 NOVEMBER 2000                                                                              5

         sure the weapon has been CLEARED! If time permits, label the weapon CLEARED and iden-
         tify the owner.
         5.1.1.2. Remove any explosives from patient and patientâ€™s bags/gear prior to entry to the
         plane. Make sure to check the patientsâ€™ uniform pockets for C-4, detonators, ammunition, etc.
         5.1.1.3. Secure knives with the loadmaster or designated individual in a similar fashion as the
         ammunition.
         5.1.1.4. Search bags and rucksacks for ammunition, knives, and explosive materiel; take
         appropriate action as described above.
         5.1.1.5. If possible, leave ammo/explosives with the unitâ€™s weapons courier.
         5.1.1.6. Civilian air ambulance companies will not take weapons, ammunitions or explosives.
         The unit is responsible to secure these or arrange to leave behind.
  5.2. Physiological Stresses of Flight. Patients in the AE environment are more susceptible to the
  physiologic stresses encountered at altitude. These factors must be considered prior to moving the
  patient. Clinical factors include patency of the respiratory passages, neuromuscular function, rate and
  depth of respiration, adequate blood flow and diffusion of oxygen at the alveolar and cell level, an
  adequate hemoglobin level, and a functioning respiratory center. The temperature, pressure, volume,
  and relative mass of a gas influence the bodyâ€™s response to barometric pressure changes as the aircraft
  changes altitude.
     5.2.1. Barometric Pressure Changes. Barometric/atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted
     against an object by the atmosphere. On ascent gas expands and on descent gas contracts. Trapped
     or partially trapped gases within body cavities (GI tract, lungs, skull, middle ear, sinuses and teeth)
     expand. Untreated gas expansion in the abdominal cavity can cause diaphragmatic crowding
     resulting in decreased lung volume and expansion. The ear and sinuses must adjust as the cabin
     pressure changes. Flying with a cold, sinus infection or facial or head injuries may require decon-
     gestants or an altitude restriction.
         5.2.1.1. An increase in altitude causes a decrease in barometric pressure (an example is a bal-
         loon expanding at altitude). If there is free air in the chest or cranium, the expanding air pres-
         sure will cause increased pressure within the structure. An altitude restriction is required.
         Consult the PMCC.
         5.2.1.2. As altitude increases, the partial pressure of oxygen decreases. The actual available
         oxygen to the tissues decreases with altitude because oxygen molecules move farther apart.
         This may result in hypoxia or lower levels of oxygen to the tissues and cells.
         5.2.1.3. The weight of a gas dissolved in a liquid is directly proportional to the weight of the
         gas above the liquid. An example is shaking a can of soda and opening it immediately. The
         balance of pressure is altered, releasing the bubbles of gas in the soda. The release of nitrogen
         bubbles into the blood after a flight or diving decompression causing the bends is another
         example. An altitude restriction is required. If the patient has conducted scuba diving opera-
         tions 24 hours prior to entry into the AE system inform the AE crew.
     5.2.2. Thermal Changes. Aircraft cabin temperature may fluctuate considerably. Temperatures
     may reach freezing or extremely high temperatures while on the ground. In-flight temperatures
6                                                              AMCPAM11-303 3 NOVEMBER 2000

       tend to be cooler. Hyperthermia and hypothermia are seen in burns and frostbite. Both conditions
       increase the bodyâ€™s oxygen requirements.
       5.2.3. Vibration. Mechanical energy is transferred to the tissues and increases muscle activity.
       Consider extra padding of suspected injuries to help diminish pain (i.e., fractures).
       5.2.4. Fatigue. All of the stresses of flight induce fatigue to some degree.
    5.3. Special Considerations.
       5.3.1. A thorough primary and secondary preflight assessment, documentation and communica-
       tion will improve patient outcomes.
           5.3.1.1. Airway: Secure with C-Spine precautions as needed.
           5.3.1.2. A Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) less than 8 may indicate hypoxia and the patient may
           need to be intubated prior to flight.
           5.3.1.3. Endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes are the best choice. Use sterile water or saline
           instead of air to inflate the balloons. Document the amount of fluid used.
              5.3.1.3.1. Report tube size to PMRC
           5.3.1.4. Breathing: Give humidified oxygen to maintain 90% saturation
           5.3.1.5. Rule out tension pneumothorax. Use a Hemilich valve on chest tubes
           5.3.1.6. Circulation: Control bleeding
              5.3.1.6.1. Maintain IV fluids; keep track of intake and output
           5.3.1.7. Immobilized fractures. Do not use air splints or MAST trousers in-flight
              5.3.1.7.1. Plaster casts should be bi-valved prior to AE
           5.3.1.8. Disability: Documented baseline GCS and vital signs preflight are essential
    5.4. Head Injuries
       5.4.1. Secure the airway, use caution with facial fractures
       5.4.2. Elevate the head and torso to 30 degrees, if not contraindicated
       5.4.3. Dress wounds
       5.4.4. Check pupils, verbal response, clear drainage from ears or nasal passages
       5.4.5. Secure the cervical area, as necessary
    5.5. Thorax
       5.5.1. Check breath sounds
       5.5.2. Check for flail chest
       5.5.3. Check for a mediastinum shift
       5.5.4. Rule out hemothorax/pneumothorax or ruptured diaphram; securely tape Hemilich valve
       on chest tube, (the AE crew can provide Heimlich valve)
           5.5.4.1. Report blood loss to PMRC and AE crew
AMCPAM11-303 3 NOVEMBER 2000                                                                              7

       5.5.5. Dress wounds as appropriate
   5.6. Abdomen and Perineum
       5.6.1. Check for obvious tenderness and tautness. Consider nasogastric tube and suction as
       required
       5.6.2. Dress wounds. Apply dry dressings to open wounds. In the event of exposed bowel, cover
       with saline dressing or plastic to maintain moisture (if available). Do not insert bowel back into
       the abdominal cavity.
       5.6.3. Prior to the insertion of a Foley catheter, if there has been an obvious or suspected abdom-
       inal injury, for males check the rectum/prostate for potential urethral tear, for females check for
       obvious vaginal bleeding. Use sterile water or saline instead of air to inflate the balloons.
   5.7. Extremities
       5.7.1. Stop hemorrhage, apply pressure dressings, and elevate the limb
       5.7.2. Dress and splint as appropriate
       5.7.3. Perform circulation and neurological checks; reapply dressings and splints as needed
   5.8. Altitude Restrictions
       5.8.1. The following injuries will require an altitude restriction to decrease the likelihood of any
       further injury/complications. When air is introduced into a cavity it will expand at altitude, having
       a potential of causing further injury:
           5.8.1.1. Head injuries
           5.8.1.2. Eye injuries
           5.8.1.3. Traumatic chest and abdominal injuries
           5.8.1.4. Decompression injuries (will require destination field elevation and 100% oxygen)
           5.8.1.5. Injuries/complications involving the heart if severely compromised
 NOTE: It is important to note that if there is an altitude restriction, the flight time will be lengthened.
Inform the PMCC of the likelihood of an altitude restriction. The PMCC will also take into consideration
the altitude of the origination and destination locations.
   5.9. AE crew augmentation. Inform the PMCC in the event there is a requirement to have specialized
   medical personnel augment the AE crew.

6. Contingency Aeromedical Evacuation Elements.
   6.1. During contingency operations, the Theater Aeromedical Evacuation System employs several
   elements to support AE command, control, communications, patient care, and system support. The
   following sections provide a brief description of the key elements.
   6.2. Aeromedical Evacuation Control Team (AECT).
       6.2.1. The AECT is the operations center where the overall planning, coordinating, and directing
       of AE operations are accomplished. The AECT is located in the Air Mobility Division of the Air
       Operations Center.
8                                                              AMCPAM11-303 3 NOVEMBER 2000

    6.3. Aeromedical Evacuation Liaison Team (AELT).
       6.3.1. The AELT provides a direct communications link and immediate coordination between the
       user service originating requirements for aeromedical evacuation, the AECT, and the PMRC.
       AELTs generally consist of Medical Service Corps officers, a flight nurse, and radio operators.
       AELTs are normally located at the echelon of the user service where casualty movements are
       authorized. Depending on the tactical operation being supported, AELTs can be collocated directly
       with a field medical facility or at any other level of command to ensure a smooth and coordinated
       casualty flow into the AE system. In addition, the AELT can be used at any AE element as a com-
       munications team as operations dictate.
    6.4. Mobile Aeromedical Staging Facility (MASF).
       6.4.1. The MASF is a mobile, tented, temporary staging facility deployed to provide supportive
       casualty nursing care and administration. MASFs are located near runways or taxiways of airfields
       or forward operating bases that are used by tactical airlift aircraft to resupply combat forces. No
       physicians are assigned to the MASF.
    6.5. Aeromedical Staging Facility (ASF).
       6.5.1. An ASF is a fixed medical facility located on or near an enplaning or deplaning air base or
       airstrip to provide patient reception, administrative processing, ground transportation, feeding,
       and limited medical care for patients entering, en route in, or leaving the aeromedical evacuation
       system. ASFs perform all of the functions of a MASF, except that they are not readily mobile. In
       addition, ASFs have physicians assigned.
    6.6. Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmembers (AECM).
       6.6.1. AE crews provide in-flight supportive nursing care aboard the evacuation aircraft. The
       crew is also responsible for ensuring the aircraft are properly configured and loaded. A standard
       AE crew normally consists of three personnel: one flight nurse and two aeromedical evacuation
       technicians. However, the crew may be tailored as the mission dictates, with double crews often
       assigned to missions with over 50 casualties.
    6.7. Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATT).
       6.7.1. CCATTs provide critical care augmentation to aeromedically evacuate injured, ill and/or
       burn patients requiring advanced care during transportation. They are available to assist the AE
       crews if a patientâ€™s condition dictates. A CCATT is comprised of three personnel: a physician who
       maybe an intensivist (cardiopulmonary), a critical care nurse, and a respiratory technician.

7. Aeromedical Evacuation Aircraft.
    7.1. There are a variety of aircraft that are capable of performing the AE mission. They include, but
    are not limited to, the following:
    7.2. C-9A Nightingale
       7.2.1. The C-9A is capable of carrying 40 litter patients, or 40 ambulatory and four litter patients,
