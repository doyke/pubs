This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Managing Aerospace Equipment Maintenance. This instruction
establishes policies and procedures for using the Quick Installation Projects (QIP) Program. It augments
AFMCR 66-34, Depot Maintenance Plant Management. It applies to all production organizations within
the Aircraft Directorate (OO-ALC/LA), Commodities Directorate (OO-ALC/LI), Silo Based ICBM Sys-
tem Program Office (OO-ALC/LM), and Technology and Industrial Support Directorate (OO-ALC/TI). It
does not apply to the Air National Guard or United States Air Force Reserve units and members.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision realigns this publication to the new numbering architecture and updates office symbols.


1. Policy. The purpose of the Quick Installation Projects (QIP) Program is for the Plant Management
Division (OO-ALC/TIP) to provide a method for Product Divisions to react to productionâ€™s changing
needs in a timely manner when normal planning efforts are impossible. Installation, relocation, modifica-
tion, or removal of non-real property facilities and equipment could be classified as a QIP project. All
changes to the contents of this publication must be authorized with the QIP Manager in the Engineering
Section (OO-ALC/TIPEE).

2. Term. QIP Program Project. A QIP program project is small in scope requiring low manpower usage,
no planning or design, and uses little or no material not readily available through OO-ALC/TIP bench-
stock.

3. Responsibilities.
   3.1. The QIP Program Manager is appointed by Engineering/Planning Branch (OO-ALC/TIPE). The
   QIP Program Manager will manage, coordinate, and will have final authority in all matters pertaining
   to QIP installation projects.

       the QIP Program Manager, the project engineer, and the customer production foreman.
       3.2.2. Submit a complete check list (see Attachment 1). The customer engineer will also submit
       a completed AFMC Form 299, Safety, Fire and Health Review.

       to personnel safety.
       3.2.4. If required, obtain approval from the 75th Civil Engineer Squadron (75 CES) on AF Form
       332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request, and coordination from Environmental Management
       Directorate (OO-ALC/EM) on AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, as
       well as coordination on any digging permits.
       3.2.5. Provide a statement of work (SOW), complete with authorization, priority requested, build-
       ing number, date, and a sequenced task list submitted on AFMC Form 305, Plant Management
       Work Order, or equivalent.
       3.2.6. Assist in preparing a bill of material (BOM).
       3.2.7. Provide prints, plans, layouts, and all other technical data.

       3.3.1. Review the project for adequacy and advise the requesting customer of acceptance or rejec-
       tion as a QIP project. Rejected projects may be submitted to the OO-ALC/TIPE for accomplish-

       QIP Program.
       3.3.2. Prioritize QIP projects based on urgency of need, manpower availability, and date request
       was received.
