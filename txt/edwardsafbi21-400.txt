Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air
Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS). No Tiering Required at T-3 or below.

1. General: These procedures will minimize maintenance actions and establish standard
inspections and documentation procedures for anomalies experienced during HiAOA flights.
2. Procedures.
   2.1. For aircraft equipped with F100-220/F100-229 series engines accomplish the following:
2                                                   EDWARDSAFBI21-400 4 AUGUST 2014


       2.1.1. All F100 engines used in HiAOA profiles will have a minimum of 1,000 cycles
       remaining on the core to time change. Engines will be bore scope inspected by the 412th
       Maintenance Squadron, Propulsion Flight within the previous 50 flight hours prior to
       HiAOA missions. The inspections will require the JFS door 3303 be opened and R/H
       ventral fin panel 4302 be removed. Conduct inspections on engines IAW TO 1F-16( )-2-
       70FI-00-21, Power Plant, 2nd and 3rd stage fan (AP-1), 3rd stage fan and 4th stage core
       (AP-7), 12th and 13th stage core (AP-3) and 1st stage high pressure turbine (AP-4).
       2.1.2. An engine diagnostic unit download will be accomplished by 445th Aircraft
       Maintenance Unit personnel after every HiAOA flight and screened for events or faults.
       Event 1020 (MFL/PFL 028) Engine Stall and Event 1190 (MFL/PFL 042) Low Main Oil
       Pressure are known anomalies that may occur during HiAOA maneuvers. If these are the
       only maintenance events or faults downloaded, the engine shall be considered serviceable
       and released for flight. Any other faults or events will be troubleshot in accordance with
       the applicable technical orders.
       2.1.3. The Propulsion Flight Chief will ensure proper monitoring of engine inspection
       results and review these results annually.
       2.1.4. Engine stall anomalies occasionally occur on HiAOA training flights. A pilot-
       reported self-clearing engine stall will be documented on the aircraft AFTO Form 781A,
       Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, IAW TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment
       Maintenance Inspection Documentation, Policies, and Procedure and in the Integrated
       Maintenance Data System (IMDS) as a CODE-2 discrepancy. Documentation will
       include aircraft tail number and engine serial number. It will not be used in repeat and/or
       recurring calculations.
       2.1.5. Normal TO requirements will be followed if the engine has a non-recoverable stall
       during a HiAOA flight or if the pilot identifies the engine operation as unusual and/or
       extreme (the previous terms and the meanings will be determined by the aircrew
       experiencing the noted conditions) and makes the appropriate AFTO Form 781 series
       form entries. These anomalies will be documented in the IMDS as a CODE-3
       discrepancy. The documentation will include aircraft tail number, engine serial number,
       maneuver number and description.
       2.1.6. The Propulsion Flight Chief will review engine performance reported as unusual
       or extreme as described in paragraph 2.1.5. Engine performance will be evaluated using
       historical engine data and borescope results accomplished by the Propulsion Flight. The
       inspections will help determine health of the engine and potential for continued operation
       in HiAOA aircraft. Engines removed from HiAOA service will not reenter HiAOA
       service until repaired and/or adjusted and determined by the Propulsion Flight Chief as
       meeting all requirements for a HiAOA mission.
    2.2. For aircraft equipped with F110-100/129 series engines accomplish the following (Note:
    No information from any portion of paragraph 2.1 applies to aircraft powered by F110-
    100/129 series engines.):
       2.2.1. To reduce the probability of encountering the faults identified in paragraph 2.2.2.
       engine oil level should be kept at or above 43 (1/2 pints) on aircraft flying HiAOA
       missions.
EDWARDSAFBI21-400 4 AUGUST 2014                                                                 3


     2.2.2. During or just after inverted HiAOA departures, aircrew may encounter the
     following: MFL’s 18 (1-15 AUG INHIB*CTRL) and/or 41 (1-38 A8 SCH*HYD/BE) on
     F110-100 engines. MFL’s 18 (1-18 AUG INHIB*S/FLT) and/or 43 (1-43 A8
     SL*ACT/H-PUMP) on F110-129 engines. These faults occur due to the engine hydraulic
     pump’s inability to move the exhaust nozzle while the engine is being operated for
     extended periods in the near zero or negative “G” environment. The hydraulic pump feed
     port is in the lower portion of the oil tank and during near zero or negative “G” flight, oil
     collects in the top of the tank and is unable to reliably feed the hydraulic pump. Once the
     faults have occurred the DEC will no longer send a signal to the hydraulic pump to move
     the nozzle and when the aircraft returns to a positive “G” loading the lack of signal will
     cause the nozzle to move and stay in the full closed “Fail Safe” mode and Augmenter
     operation will be inhibited.
     2.2.3. Corrective action for the condition described in paragraph 2.2.2. is to return the
     aircraft to level, 1”G” flight, stabilize for at least 10 seconds, cycle ENG CONT switch to
     SEC, hold for at least 10 seconds then move switch back to PRI. If the faults disappear,
     the mission can continue normally and no maintenance action other than downloading the
     faults will be required upon landing. If the faults persist or return excessively as
     determined by the pilot, follow flight manual instructions.
        2.2.3.1. Pilots will document all cycles of the ENG CONT switch to SEC and back to
        PRI to clear nozzle and Mach Fail Faults as code 2.
     2.2.4. Per L.M. Aero time limit for zero oil pressure during inverted departures with
     throttle at idle has been increased, via engineering disposition, to 2 minutes. No
     maintenance is required as long as the 2 minute time limit is not exceeded.
     2.2.5. During or just after HiAOA departures, aircrew may encounter an MFL 17 (1-50
     A/C SIG*MN) on F110-100 engines or an MFL 17 (1-17 A/C SIG*MN) on F110-129
     engines. These faults occur due to the rapid and erratic speed changes involved in a
     HiAOA departure maneuver.
     2.2.6. Corrective action for the conditions described in paragraph 2.2.5. is to recover the
     aircraft from the departure, stabilize for at least 10 seconds, cycle ENG CONT switch to
     SEC, hold for at least 10 seconds then move switch back to PRI. If the fault disappears
     the mission can continue normally and no maintenance action other than downloading the
     fault will be required upon landing. If the fault persists or returns excessively as
     determined by the pilot, follow flight manual instruction. Note: Cycling the engine
     control switch in-flight will cause an MFL 51 (1-48 SEC TRANSFER*BE) fault on a
     F110-100 and an MFL 14 (1-14 SEC TRANSFER*BE) fault on a F110-129 to be
     downloaded after flight. This is totally acceptable if the engine responded properly to the
     PRI / SEC / PRI switch movement while in-flight.
     2.2.7. Document DEEC/NOZZLE reset using PRI/SEC/PRI cycle on AFTO 781A and in
     IMDS as Code-2 discrepancy. Documentation will include aircraft tail number, engine
     serial number, reason for and number of cycles.
  2.3. For aircraft equipped with analog Flight Control System (FLCS) accomplish the
  following:
4                                                   EDWARDSAFBI21-400 4 AUGUST 2014


       2.3.1. To ensure serviceability of the FLCS reset interlock circuitry, the system will be
       inspected within 25 flight hours prior to a HiAOA flight in accordance with M-Series
       Maintenance Checklist LCL-412TS-M-98-017. The FLCS reset interlock circuitry check
       is required in order to safely reset Dual FC and P, R, and Y light indications following
       HiAOA maneuvers. While HiAOA can be safely flown without this check, a Dual FC
       and P, R, or Y light will result in mission termination. It is 412 TW policy to perform
       this check for all HiAOA aircraft to avert any unnecessary maintenance and loss of
       training. The FLCS reset interlock circuitry will also be inspected any time the Flight
       Control Computer (FLCC), flight control panel or any connectors (associated with the
       system) are removed and replaced.
       2.3.2. Flight control anomalies occasionally occur on HiAOA training flights. Resettable
       Axis (P, R and/or Y) and/or SERVO failure(s) that occur during departures will be
       documented on the AFTO Form 781A and in the IMDS as a CODE-2 discrepancy.
       Documentation will include aircraft tail number, FLCC and electronic component
       assembly (ECA) serial numbers.
       2.3.3. Normal TO requirements IAW TO 1F-16( )-2-27FI-00, Series Fault Isolation, and
       other local procedures, as determined by the MXG Commander, will be followed if the
       flight controls do not reset. These anomalies will be documented in IMDS as a CODE-3
       discrepancy using the appropriate WUC. The documentation will include aircraft tail
       number, FLCC and ECA serial numbers maneuver number and maneuver description.
    2.4. For aircraft equipped with digital FLCS paragraph 2.3. does not apply.           Follow
    established TO procedures for any anomalies.
    2.5. An emergency power unit monopropellant check will be performed within 180 days or
    within 100 flight hours prior to a HiAOA flight, whichever occurs first. If the aircraft is
    within 10 hours of phase inspection at the expiration of this currency, then flying may
    continue until phase without an additional monopropellant check.
    2.6. A Power Drive Unit (PDU) oil level check will be performed every 7 days when the
    aircraft has flown a HiAOA sortie during this time period. In the event the aircraft has not
    flown a HiAOA sortie in the previous 7 days, the PDU oil check will revert to the aircraft’s –
    6 TOs, phase inspection requirement. The aircraft’s AFTO Form 781K, Aerospace Vehicle
    Inspection, Engine Data, Calendar Inspection and Delayed Discrepancy Document, will be
    updated to the next 7-day calendar inspection with an INFO NOTE on the AFTO Form 781A
    stating “PDU oil check not required, aircraft has not flown HiAOA sorties during the last 7
    days”.
    2.7. A post-flight battery inspection will be accomplished after every HiAOA sortie. This
    inspection only applies to aircraft not modified with the sealed lead acid battery and will
    include a visual check for leakage and a capacitance check.
    2.8. Inspection intervals listed in paragraphs 2.5. through 2.7. will be documented on the
    aircraft AFTO Form 781K and in the IMDS.
    2.9. In cases when an aircrew reports an unusual in-flight departure, the original Heads-Up
    Display tape (provided the tape is unclassified), along with the data downloaded from the
    propulsion and flight control systems, will be sent to the Lockheed-Martin Flight Control
EDWARDSAFBI21-400 4 AUGUST 2014                                                          5


  Specialists for analysis to aid troubleshooting. Additionally, the maneuver number and
  description will be included as part of the maintenance debrief.
  2.10. Flight Data Recorder (FDR)/Crash Survivable Flight Data Recorder (CSFDR) MFL’s
  may be encountered by aircrew due to Hi AOA mission profiles.
     2.10.1. The following FDR/CSFDR MFL’s can be reset by the aircrew with no mission
     impact and no maintenance actions required: 024 Special Event, 060 FCS Caution /
     FLCS Reset Input, 061 FLCS Warning and 068 SEC / EEC Caution Light Input.
     2.10.2. The following FDR/CSFDR MFL’s are considered “special events” by tech data
     and cannot be reset by the aircrew: 084 Dual Fail / FLCS Warning Light, 091 ENG Stall
     / Stagnation, 092 AOA Departure, 094 FLCS Reset and 097 SEC Caution Light. System
     operation will rewrite itself after two events. The MFL’s are generated by the mission
     profile and if verified with the aircrew no maintenance actions will be required.
