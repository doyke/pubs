This instruction establishes policies and procedures for organic depot level maintenance internal work-
load control functions, planning functions, and scheduling functions within the Maintenance Directorate
(M/D) at the Air Logistics Centers (ALCs) and AMARC. Additionally, AMARC stores aerospace assets
and reclaims parts for Department of Defense (DoD) and other customers. AMARC systems meet the
intent of these requirements. Specific procedures in this instruction pertaining to systems that AMARC
does not utilize are not applicable. It prescribes management techniques for establishment of labor and
material requirements and the associated document process to control work requirements at the ALCs. It
prescribes standard forms, reports and various data system input requirements, and output products neces-
sary for effectively executing depot maintenance production. Compliance with this instruction is MAN-
DATORY.
This document provides the procedures, terminology, and responsibilities for depot maintenance opera-
tional workloading, planning, and scheduling. This instruction has been aligned to be compatible with
AFMCI 21-129, Depot Maintenance Management, Depot Repair Enhancement Process (DREP). All ter-
minology and procedures reflect DREP concepts. The instruction has one chapter each for workloading,
planning, and scheduling. Some new definitions, abbreviations, and acronyms have been added to bring
the instruction up to the present. Additional information for explanation of the Depot Maintenance
Accounting and Production System (DMAPS) can be found at the URL site:

                          OPERATIONAL WORKLOAD AND CONTROL

Section 1A—CONTROL OF WORKLOAD

1.1. General. The Air Logistics Center (ALC) and AMARC Maintenance Directorate manages organic
depot-level maintenance production facilities required to repair and modify Air Force materiel. AMARC
also stores aerospace assets and reclaims parts. Workload control is an integral part of that mission. It
starts from the point of building a plan, and ends when the last item is completed for the last job order for
a given fiscal period. The buyer-seller relationship is outlined in AFMCI 21-111, Depot Maintenance
Business Area (DMBA) Financial Operating Procedures. AFMCI 21-105, Depot Maintenance Work
Measurement, covers the policies and procedures governing the Depot Purchased Equipment Mainte-
nance (DPEM) customers of the Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG). Criteria in this directive
pertain to policies, controls, and procedure applicable to each individual item of workload from the point
before induction through job closure.

1.2. Relationship with Other Functions. Workloading cannot be entirely separated from other internal
M/D functions. ALC and AMARC M/D personnel involved with the workloading process must also be
aware of the required relationship with the planning and scheduling functions. The planning aspects of a
job order system are outlined in Chapter 2; scheduling in Chapter 3.

1.3. Operating Policy. The emphasis on workload management includes control of all direct work from
point of input through the resulting costs. This control over workload in no way affects the basic charter
of the M/D, but enhances response by limiting support to valid mission requirements of a legitimate cus-
tomer. The following policies will be adhered to:
   1.3.1. Processing Technical Order Compliance (TOC). These are items that did not generate from the
   Technical Repair Center (TRC). Certain commodity items are coded by the Item Manager (IM) as
   being within the capability of any SPD to perform TOC regardless of their TRC designation. When
   the maintenance workloading function determines the items are acceptable, the required support must
   be charged against the responsible IM's type 6 Project Order (PO). If there is no current PO from the
   originating SPD, workloading personnel will negotiate with the responsible IM to obtain a type 6 PO
   to cover the prescribed work. Under no circumstances may this non-TRC TOC work be accomplished
   against another type PO. Refer to AFMCI 21-111 for all types of POs.
   1.3.2. Required Correlation Between Negotiated Work Specifications and Quality Assurance Verifi-
   cation Requirements. Under the DMAG operation, the M/D must rigidly observe the negotiated job
   specification as established with the customer. Planned workbooks and quality verification require-
   ments will be developed within these guidelines. During the course of the job, when there are other
   defects or work requirements identified by the quality or production function and when correction
   would cause the man-hour ceiling originally agreed to with the customer to be exceeded, the criteria
   of AFMCI 21-125, Management of Depot Maintenance Programs will be followed. The Project
   Administrative Officer (PAO) will approve all over and above work.
   1.3.3. Work negotiated (as well as MISTR items driven by daily Execution and Prioritization of
   Repair Support System (EXPRESS) requirements, with the exception of Aircraft) is a continuous
   effort. Express items are referenced in AFMCI 21-129 and managed in D075. The processes will
8                                                                     AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


    always have the objective of meeting warfighter requirements and maintaining mission capable rates.
    To accomplish this necessitates eliminating capability where requirements no longer exist and shifting
    capability to match changes in requirements.
    1.3.4. Control numbers will be electronically assigned to provide a method of continuity and assur-
    ance so that specific commodities can be identified to either a permanent or temporary category. All
    data products, in relation to control number assignment, are designed and distributed specifically for
    the use of the central control number assignment function. Workload personnel review current man-
    agement products to assure the proper use of production numbers on Work Authorization Documents
    (WADs). WADs are related to all supporting documents through the medium of the production num-
    ber, which consists of a basic control number and job designator and results in:
       1.3.4.1. Identification and control of work being done in the maintenance shops.
       1.3.4.2. Identification of the type work to be done.
       1.3.4.3. A medium for the allocation and control of parts and material required to do the work.
       1.3.4.4. A medium for the accumulation of Direct Product Earned Hours (DPEH) and end item
       inductions/completions at Job Order Number (JON) level.
       1.3.4.5. A medium for the control of the accumulation and application of material consumption
       data and accurate cost data.
    1.3.5. For management purposes, changes to control numbers are not authorized. If an incorrect con-
    trol number has been opened, correct the error by closing the incorrect control number and opening a
    new control number. When workloads are transferred from one division to another, the control num-
    ber won't be changed. Block assignment of control number for any reason is not authorized.

1.4. Stabilization of Rates. AFMCI 21-111 contains AFMC policy on sales rates. ALC M/D personnel
involved with various WADs should be aware of the contents of that reference as well as the fact that
AFMC must approve any changes to those rates.

1.5. Workload Requirements. Accurate identification of individual workload requirements is necessary
to ensure that each item of inducted workload will be properly categorized throughout the M/D produc-
tion process. Examples of this are the Repair Group Categories (RGCs) and reimbursement codes. These
types of identifiers apply to each workload during the actual negotiations with the DMAG customer. All
items must have a PO established before any work or service is performed.

1.6. Project Orders. AFMCI 21-111, contains the policies and procedures associated with PO manage-
ment and control. M/D workload personnel must be aware of their roles outlined therein. No workload,
regardless of size, can be brought into the production process without an impact on the financial picture of
a PO. Numerous computer output products are available electronically from the Project Order Control
System (G004B) to portray a current position for those workloads, which have been inducted.
NOTE: Under Depot Information Financial Management System (DMAPS) Phase II the G004B is
obsolete. The information for a financial picture is contained in the DMAPS website.

1.7. Workload Generation. Depot maintenance workloads may be generated from various sources such
as base or tenant organizations, M/D Management of Items Subject to Repair (MISTR) drives, M/D air-
craft/missile/engine project directives, as well as from internal M/D requirements. Regardless of the
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                              9


source, any workload going through the production process will be associated with a production number.
A production number is composed of a five-digit control number and a one-digit job designator. Produc-
tion numbers are categorized as permanent, temporary, or support, depending upon the type/situation of
the specific workload involved. General guidelines are as follows:
   1.7.1. Permanent Production Numbers. Contain a numeric in the first position. Application:
       1.7.1.1. Serialized aircraft, missile, and Other Major End Items (OMEI).
       1.7.1.2. All other areas where there is a repetitive/continuous workload; that is, MISTR, Mission
       Design Series (MDS), Type/Model/Series (TMS) engines, or areas that involve a workload with a
       long flow time.
   1.7.2. Temporary Production Numbers. Begin with an alpha in the first position. Application:
       1.7.2.1. All off-base work.
       1.7.2.2. All repairs done on M/D equipment,
       1.7.2.3. All manufacture.
       1.7.2.4. All other workloads that don't justify the establishment, file maintenance of extensive
       permanent material, and labor standards in the associated computer systems. This area includes
       both planned and unplanned workloads.
   1.7.3. Project Directives. These will normally have a permanent production number assigned. How-
   ever, if the quantity is insufficient to warrant setting up of finite labor and material standards, the
   workload technician will contact the issuing activity and request the issuance of a computer generated
   AFMC Form 206, Temporary Work Request. This action allows setting up a temporary production
   number and use of the project directive as an attachment to the WAD.
   1.7.4. Base Tenant Support. All Base Tenant support should be in accordance with local Host Tenant
   Agreements. Where differences occur between the Host Tenant agreements and Depot Maintenance
   Activity Group (DMAG) policy and procedures, the Depot Maintenance Systems (DMS), Air Force
   Industrial Funds (AFIF) policy and procedures will take precedence. Whenever Host-Tenant agree-
   ments are initially set up or revised, the Maintenance personnel will be familiar with the DMAG pro-
   cedures and will consider these procedures/policies in their agreement. Recurring work will be
   requested on computer generated AFMC Form 206 by the tenant, and may involve either of two
   Resource Control Center (RCC) rate End Item Sales Price (EISP) applications Bill of Material Indica-
   tor (BOMI = M or R) (unclear). The Data Processing Code (DPC) will be S, T prefix CN will be used.
   BOMI will be M or R, only one labor operation with OSH = 1.000 hour, Repair Group Category
   (RGC) will be N and the JON Quarterly Sales Indicator (QSI) of M and Unit of Measure (UOM) of
   HR will be machine assigned. In the job quantity block, the originator will show the 1st quarter's
   man-hour requirement. MAWW will prepare AFMC Forms 206 for each RCC doing work for that
   tenant and send them to the responsible Production Planning Office for preparation of the AFMC
   Form 237, Temporary Labor and Material Plan. For Base Tenant Support temporary jobs, the Bill
   of Material Indicator (BOMI) now becomes an RCC rate indicator and shows which rate is to be used
   to compute the EISP. When the BOMI = R, the EISP is computed using the RCC labor rate plus the
   RCC direct material rate. Any bill of material list when the BOMI is R is not computed in the EISP.
   When the BOMI = M the EISP is computed using the RCC labor rate plus the bill of material list. If
   no bill of material list exists, and the BOMI = M the EISP will be computed using the RCC labor rate
   only. If a tenant support job is going to require an excessive amount of direct material which will not
10                                                                    AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     be covered by the RCC direct material rate, a separate AFMC Form 206 and AFMC Form 237 is pre-
     pared and material planned accordingly. In this situation, use RGC N and DPC N. If this type of tenant
     support jobs is recurring, consider making them permanent jobs with project order 7, RCC N and DPC
     N. Temporary JONs with DPC S won't be automatically closed, but will be updated each succeeding
     quarter by the computer. At the end of each quarter, the computer will reduce the Job Order Quantity
     (JOQ) to what has been completed, and allow the JON to go to sales. The computer will then reestab-
     lish the production number with the next quarterly JON suffix. At the beginning of each quarter, the
     tenant will electronically initiate a new 206 to the workload technician depicting the new man-hour
     and dollar value requirement in the JOQ and estimated job total cost blocks. The workload technician
     will then submit computer generated 930 transaction, G004L File Maintenance Transactions, to file
     maintain the new JOQs for each JON set up for that tenant.
     1.7.5. Field Engine Exchangeable Management System (FEEMS). Identifies contract exchangeable
     requirements that support aircraft engines repaired at the co-located ALC DMAG organic facility.
     This system identifies these exchangeables as part of the engine requirements package for incorpora-
     tion in the POM, BES, and FP. When these packages are funded, the exchangeables identified to these
     engines are then managed as part of the RGC J MISTR program.

1.8. Hourly Sales Rates and End Item Sales Prices (EISP). Each individual workload, when com-
pleted, will generate revenue for the DMAG. That revenue is designed to offset expenses that have been
incurred to complete the workload. The generation of the revenue is accomplished by establishing a rate
or price for the product(s) or service. While AFMCI 21-111 contains the criteria applicable to sales rates
approval, the criteria outlined below represents the application of those rates
     1.8.1. Resource Control Center (RCC) Rates. These are annual average hourly rate approved by HQ
     AFMC before the beginning of a fiscal year, and used as follows:
        1.8.1.1. Aircraft, Missile, Other Manufactured End Item (OMEI). The RCC rate forms the initial
        M/D baseline for the HQ AFMC approved Direct Product Standard Hour (DPSH) rate for these
        areas. Before the M/D requests approval of the generated rates, the financial impact caused by
        carry-over work must be considered. This may dictate a change to the RCC rate or the M/D may
        elect to change only the computer generated end result.
        1.8.1.2. Permanent production numbers on all other workloads. The RCC hourly rate is input to
        the Depot Maintenance Production Cost System (G072A) by the Workload Programming Plan-
        ning and Control System (G004C) as directed by HQ AFMC before computation of the next fiscal
        year EISP. The G072A system then computes an EISP for each assigned permanent production
        number. During September each year these prices are input to the G004L system. The G004L sys-
        tem maintains a separate file of these prices called the Sales Price Master. These prices remain
        firm throughout the next fiscal year unless a change is approved by HQ AFMC. For new work-
        loads, (new production numbers) the new price is input to the Sales Price Master (SPM) file 600D,
        Production Order. Individual price changes authorized by HQ AFMC are electronically input to
        the SPM and controlled by Financial Management. AFMCI 21-111, identifies the engine sales
        price development and usage.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G072A is obsolete.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                                11


       1.8.1.3. Temporary production numbers. The RCC hourly rate is input to a computer system
       (G004L) by G004C on or about 1 October to compute either an average hourly sales price or an
       EISP.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G004C may not be available.
       1.8.1.4. All production numbers. The input of RCC rates to the above designated computer sys-
       tems pertains to RCCs which are in existence in G004C as of 1 September of each year. If new
       RCCs are set up during the year, their rates are provided to the designated systems after HQ
       AFMC approval. See AFMCI 21-111 for complete detail on RCC rate approval process.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G004C may not be available.
          1.8.1.4.1. Types of Sales Rates. These are either hourly or end item. The specific workload
          and/or a method of accomplishment dictate which of the two types applies.
          1.8.1.4.2. Computational Routines for Temporary Production Numbers. Specific details are
          contained in this instruction under Chapter 2, Operational Planning.
          1.8.1.4.3. Computational Routines for Permanent Production Numbers (non-serialized). See
          AFMCI 21-111.
          1.8.1.4.4. Other Major End Item (OMEI) Pricing. See Chapter 2 this instruction for specific
          details.

1.9. Responsibilities of the Workloader.
   1.9.1. Ensures valid production numbers are established on all WADS.
   1.9.2. Ensures all new work requests are covered by a funded PO. If determined to be unfunded (error
   messages of ****** on G004L-L3G listing), takes immediate action to get a PO amendment. Emer-
   gency unfunded work, Mission Capability (MICAP) may be started with a telephone call from the
   customer to the workloader. Starts daily follow-up action to get proper funding. Reference 21-111
   Financial Operating Procedures. Makes sure all nonemergency unfunded work is not started.
NOTE: For DMAPS all new work requests are covered by a funded PO upfront with no exceptions.
   1.9.3. Negotiates, accepts, or rejects all depot maintenance requests from the customer. Acceptance of
   project orders should be based on the existing or adjusted organic capability to perform the work or
   service requested and if the completion date is feasible.
   1.9.4. Verifies that all fields on the computer generated AFMC Form 206 are correct.
   1.9.5. Ensures all manufacture requests other than line support and tenant support priorities 2A or 2B
   are processed through supply.
   1.9.6. Ensures joint tenant agreements require the tenant to first contact supply for a serviceable item
   before requesting depot maintenance support.
   1.9.7. Processes and controls all error/valid transaction listings for tenant activities related to tempo-
   rary work requests. Coordinates by telephone for correction of erroneous data on high priority tenant
   requests.
   1.9.8. Ensures sales rates being used by the data systems are only those that have been approved by
   HQ AFMC.
12                                                                      AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     1.9.9. Maintains an audit function for control and quality of all file maintenance transactions. This
     includes:
        1.9.9.1. Edits all pertinent blocks on computer-generated forms to ensure information is correct
        before sending to G004L.
        1.9.9.2. Receives and checks the G004L-L3G daily to ensure previous day's input was accepted.
        If errors exist, initiates and completes corrective action. G004L-L3G workloader review list is
        obtained electronically.
     1.9.10. Determines/updates travel and per diem costs for A-Prefix WADS. Obtains planned expense
     material costs, if applicable, from the planning function. Reviews for adequacy and inserts into the
     applicable data system before closing A-prefix WADS. Obtains from the G004H system and file main-
     tains, with a computer generated AFMC Form 930, G004L File Maintenance Transactions, transac-
     tion, material costs related to tenant workload requests. This must be done on time to prevent M/D
     absorbing costs.
     1.9.11. Aids the scheduler in designating the type of JON suffix, either monthly or quarterly, for the
     initial opening of permanent WADS when requested.
     1.9.12. Acts as the directorate focal point for providing applicable production status to the initiator of
     the depot maintenance repair requirement.
     1.9.13. Ensures all RCCs established within the M/D are contained in the master table. Updates as
     required according to AFMCI 21-111.
     1.9.14. Reviews Customer Account Identity (CAI) and Mission Design Series (MDS) table in G004L
     as required. Additions/deletions must be submitted thru the G004L System OPR. HQ AFMC must
     approve any change to the MDS table.
     1.9.15. Ensures the correct Funds Classification Reference Number (FCRN) is maintained in the mas-
     ter JON record of the G004L system at all times.

1.10. Work Performance Category Descriptions (Job designator).
     1.10.1. Code A - Major Overhaul. This type maintenance consists of complete end item disassembly,
     cleaning, inspection for repair requirements, and tests on the operating components and basic struc-
     ture to determine the authorized support necessary to restore serviceability. Inspection and repair
     actions may include: replacement of subassemblies or operating components, and adjustment, calibra-
     tion, reassembly, and functional testing of the complete unit. It is considered to be synonymous with
     the terms rework or rebuild. Modification may be done along with the repair when its man-hours are
     subordinate to the repair requirement. This includes complete rehabilitation of AF equipment: struc-
     tural repairs required on major airframe components as the result of crash, battle, or comparable dam-
     ages which require depot facilities, skills, and tooling to restore alignment.
     1.10.2. Code B - Progressive Maintenance/Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM). PDM or pro-
     gressive maintenance includes a predetermined amount of repair work requiring depot skills, equip-
     ment and tooling, that requires disassembly, necessary cleaning, and inspection for repair or
     replacement, as necessary, of the component and assemblies. This defined cycle of repair may be
     equated with one increment of a periodic maintenance overhaul when done on a progressive basis
     requiring two or more inputs to the end item. It is authorization to reassemble, calibrate, adjust, and
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                                13


  functionally test the complete assembly. Modifications may be done along with and included under
  code B when it is considered a subordinate portion of the total work.
  1.10.3. Code C – Depot performance of all two level organizational and intermediate workloads other
  than engines. This code applies to that level of maintenance done by the DMAG organic facilities that
  does not require skills or equipment capabilities above that authorized for an AF organization or inter-
  mediate maintenance function. Maintenance will be performed in a depot under this code on commod-
  ity component items Expendability-Recoverability-Reparability-Category (ERRC) coded for repair at
  organizational or intermediate level (XF, NF, XD, and ND) which can be economically restored to a
  serviceable condition within this level of repair.
  1.10.4. Code D - Activation of Stored Major Item. This maintenance includes the depreservation, ser-
  vicing, inspection, testing, and replacement of subassemblies, as required, on major end items that
  have been stored or kept in an inactive pool at an authorized storage point. The range of end items
  includes aircraft, missiles, aircraft engines, vehicles, and motorized equipment. Removal from ship-
  ment is included under this code.
  1.10.5. Code E - Inactivation, Storage Preparation, and In Storage Maintenance of Major Items. This
  code applies to the preparation for temporary or long-term storage of major items at authorized AFMC
  storage points. Major end items include aircraft, missiles, aircraft engines, vehicles, and motorized
  equipment. For routine maintenance required on the stored items to maintain the desired level of ser-
  viceability, refer to Code M. Preparation for shipment is included under this code.
  1.10.6. Code F – Renovation Proof Testing. This code applies when the maintenance work consists of
  performing a proof test procedure on a representative quantity of items or material to determine
  whether specification characteristics are satisfactory. This testing will result in the destruction or loss
  of a predetermined stock of supply or customer owned items. Items requiring proof testing will
  include ordnance items, missile propellant mixtures, or other items or material whose projected shelf
  life can only be determined through a sample destruct and analysis process. Included under this code
  is the required documentation evaluating the test results necessary to ensure retention of the desired
  capability in the remaining on hand stock.
  1.10.7. Code G – Analytical Rework Evaluation of Materials and In-Service Items. This code is
  applied when a depot maintenance mission organization performs a chemical or physical analysis of
  in service items or new material, including Analytical Condition Inspection (ACI) of aircraft. This
  analysis includes the tear down necessary for deficiency inspection of components or to facilitate lab-
  oratory processing that is, chemical, metallurgical, physical, etc. Included is the technical evaluation
  and documentation of the findings or determination of maintenance criteria as in an item undergoing
  prototype analysis for planning purposes during which no repair is involved. If depot maintenance
  (Code A, B, or C) is to be performed concurrent with the teardown and analysis work, the appropriate
  code will apply for the repair portion of the job. Turn-in to supply on the code G job and issue to the
  code A job order if required. Material Deficiency Reports (MDR) under coverage of (Technical Order)
  TO 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting And Investigating System, may be processed using per-
  manent or temporary job order with code G. If the TRC is not the responsible TRC for the item, use
  the temporary job order with code G and include the analysis for, teardown, (repair and test) along
  with the documentation as applicable. The item manager initiates AFMC Form 206 in this case. Code
  G also applies when an end item is undergoing prototype analysis for labor and material planning pur-
  poses in which no repair is involved. Code G may also apply when the technical evaluation and docu-
14                                                                      AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     mentation result from kit-proofing and print proofing AFMC Form 206 is initiated by the item
     manager for each evaluation.
NOTE: Local OI’s need to apply.
     1.10.8. Code H – Conversion/Modification. A conversion will alter the basic characteristics of an
     item to change the mission, performance, or capability. Normally, these modifications are known as
     Class V Mods. Minor repairs may be performed under this code only when accomplished along with
     conversion and the man-hours requirement is either subordinate to the change or essential to the oper-
     ating safety of the end assembly. A modification is the alteration or change of the physical makeup of
     a weapon support system, subsystem, component, or part in accordance with approved technical
     direction of TOC. These are known as Class IV modifications. This type of maintenance covers the
     accomplishment of Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO) on otherwise serviceable stock.
     These types of items require periodic inspection and testing, as specified in the technical order gov-
     erning the item's maintenance cycles.
     1.10.9. Code I - Repair. Depot performance of Organizational and Intermediate Level Maintenance.
     This code applies to that level of maintenance done by the DMAG organic facilities that do not require
     skills or equipment capabilities above that authorized for an AF organizational or intermediate main-
     tenance function. This code applies to maintenance performed on aircraft that are base assigned, or in
     a transient status, not scheduled for input on a PDM project. This aircraft maintenance includes daily
     and routine inspection and replacement of defective or time change accessories, the accomplishment
     of periodic inspections specified in applicable TOs, and the required maintenance. When a portion of
     a job requires depot level support, include the organizational or intermediate level part of the work
     under the higher level. Repair of damages to exterior aircraft surfaces, corroded or worn airframe
     components, or correction of minor structural defects not requiring depot precision alignment is also
     included in Code I. The disassembly or buildup maintenance required for engine power packs is
     within the scope of this code. Maintenance will be done in a depot under this code on commodity
     component items Expendability-Recoverability-Reparability-Category (ERRC) coded for repair at
     organizational or intermediate level (X R, XF, or NF) which can be economically restored to a service-
     able condition within this level of repair. This level of repair will also apply to any recoverable type
     end item (XD, ND) that is generated regardless of its assigned overhaul TRC depot. This code applies
     to M/D owned PME (S prefix control number only is authorized). All cost class 4 work will be done
     under this code (Exception - see code T).
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II S prefix control numbers no longer exist.
     1.10.10. Code J -Inspection and Test, Condition Determination or Bench Check. T h i s               code
     applies to the physical examination or testing required in determining the condition status of an item.
     This action must be a separate and distinct requirement applicable to the total job. Condition status
     includes the determination of whether the item being examined can properly perform its intended use,
     and the level of repair that would be necessary to restore serviceability should the item be classified as
     reparable. No type of repair is authorized under this code. NOTE: When asset characteristics are out-
     side of normal repair requirements, use of code J is required to process assets for base supply through
     the M/D before the actual repair or restoration to a serviceable condition. The WAD must contain a
     data processing code T. These are items having a high condemnation rate or an extremely low con-
     demnation rate when condition classification is undetermined. Use this code as directed by AFMCI
     21-111.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                           15


  1.10.11. Code K - Manufacture and Fabrication. This code applies to the manufacture or assem-
  bly/fabrication of any item. Manufacture of suggestion items, tools, and equipment is included.
  1.10.12. Code L - Reclamation. This code authorizes to process end items, assemblies, or subassem-
  blies for parts and components that will be added to the supply inventory or immediately consumed.
  Limit repair of the part reclaimed under this code to the minimum usable level. Dispose of the remains
  of the reclaimed end items. It is authorized to process the residue material to disposal. Code L also
  covers the demilitarization of assemblies before disposal. Use code L for IM/SM directed cannibaliza-
  tion of stock from supply using cost code H. Dispose of the cannibalized asset as directed by the man-
  ager. Use DPC N with this type of JOB regardless of origin. (See AFMCI 21-130, Equipment
  Maintenance Material Control, for the schedulers’ instructions for cannibalization.)
  1.10.13. Code M - Storage. This code includes the inspection, represervation, and routine mainte-
  nance of weapons systems, equipment items, subsystems, and components in the supply system in a
  storage status to maintain a predetermined level of serviceability.
  1.10.14. Code N -Technical Depot Assistance. This code is used to authorize the use of qualified
  depot maintenance workers to provide technical information, instructions and guidance, or to perform
  work requiring specialized depot skills at a customer’s location outside the M/D under an RGC of area
  or base assistance, (AFR 11- 4 agreement or TO 00-25-107, Maintenance Assistance). This code is
  also used for accounting of foreign student training when accomplished in the M/D shops (AFMCI
  21-111).
     1.10.14.1. Within depot shops, T- prefix control number and code N must be set up in the appro-
     priate RCC where the training is performed. When a job price has been negotiated, the price will
     be divided by the RCC rate to determine the total man-hours that will be earned. The JOQ should
     be 1 and the operation occurrence 1. In this case, the operation standard hours are the same as the
     man-hours to be earned. This code is also used for accounting of foreign student training under
     RGC N when done in the M/D shops. Costing of this training is accomplished using the applicable
     RCC approved rate from the G004C system. See AFMCI 21-111, for policy and procedures.
     1.10.14.2. This code includes all demilitarization other than that incidental to reclamation (Code
     L).
  1.10.15. Code T - Other Work. This type applies to other work not covered by other authorized
  WPCs.
  1.10.16. Code U - Software Support. The sum of all efforts required to correct software deficiencies
  to ensure that, during the post-deployment phase of a mission-critical computer system’s life, the
  implemented and fielded software continue to support the system mission. Depot maintenance soft-
  ware support excludes efforts required to update software to operate the new hardware configurations
  or required to support new missions. Depot maintenance software support addresses both embedded
  software systems and support equipment software (e.g., automated test equipment.
  1.10.17. Code W - Contractor Logistics Support (CLS). CLS is commercial support for those
  weapons systems and equipment that do no have an organic support base established. Contractors pro-
  vide total support including depot maintenance for the equipment, end-item, and components. Only
  those maintenance functions that would be classified as depot level, if the equipment was maintained
  organically, will be included.
16                                                                 AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     1.10.18. Code Y - Scheduled Maintenance. The application of certain maintenance procedures to
     ensure that aeronautical equipment is maintained by controlling degradation resulting from time,
     operation cycles, use, and climatic exposure. Scheduled maintenance requirements are the minimum
     necessary under all conditions, and are mandatory to insure timely discovery and correction of
     defects. Includes Standards Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM) and Programmed Depot Maintenance
     (PDM).

1.11. Field Team Requirements. These requirements are normally within the scope of TO 00-25-107.
AFMC Form 206 is initiated using Repair Group Category, (RGC) B/M on a type 6 Project Order with a
job designator of N. When additional off base A prefix requirements generate for RGC’s D, F, H, L, or S,
man-hours expended in the following functions related to each requirement are chargeable:
     1.11.1. Preparation for trip:
        1.11.1.1. Inventory tool kits.
        1.11.1.2. Process special tools/equipment.
        1.11.1.3. Obtain equipment/tool property passes.
        1.11.1.4. Acquire technical data.
        1.11.1.5. Obtain work control documents with referenced technical data.
        1.11.1.6. Obtain advance payment.
        1.11.1.7. Obtain airline tickets.
        1.11.1.8. Clear their organizations.
        1.11.1.9. Obtain any special clothing issues.
     1.11.2. Return processing:
        1.11.2.1. Process individual itinerary.
        1.11.2.2. Process back into work center.
        1.11.2.3. Check tools into shop.
        1.11.2.4. Turn-in equipment used on TDY.
        1.11.2.5. Clear property pass.
        1.11.2.6. Turn in special issue material.

Section 1B—PROCEDURES

1.12. Job Order Number (JON). A JON is a nine-position alphanumeric combination composed of the
control number, job designator, and a three-position suffix.
     1.12.1. Type of Production Control Numbers:
        1.12.1.1. Permanent. A permanent control number is a five-digit number assigned to each end/line
        item of planned workloads: MISTR, Type Mission Series (TMS), and Mission Design Series
        (MDS), or any recurring planned workload. The range of permanent control numbers (to be elec-
        tronically and or manually assigned) will run from numbers 00001 through 99999. The assign-
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                              17


     ment of the number also dictates a need to set up labor and material standards (by planning) in the
     applicable data systems.
     1.12.1.2. Temporary. A temporary control number is composed of one alpha (first position)
     assigned by the workloader, and four numerics assigned to each end/line item of temporary or
     nonrecurring workloads. These four numerics are computer generated.
  1.12.2. JON Suffix. This is a three-position alphanumeric code that will be determined and assigned
  in accordance with the following:
     1.12.2.1. If the estimated unit cost is $90,000 or more and is subject to Examination and Inspec-
     tion (E & I), such as aircraft, missiles and OMEI, the last three positions must relate to a specific
     serial number. The following rules apply to serialized suffix assignment:
         1.12.2.1.1. For G037E records, the JON suffix must be numeric and correspond to the G037E
         weapon identity code.
         1.12.2.1.2. For non-G037E items involving supply, the JON suffix must be numeric with a
         zero in the third position for Air Force items and Ownership Purpose Code (OPC) of 1, 4, or 5
         for DMISA items.
         1.12.2.1.3. Serialized items that are non-G037E not involving supply will have a JON suffix
         of all alphas.
     1.12.2.2. If the estimated unit cost is $15,000 to $90,000 and is subject to E & I. The first and sec-
     ond positions represent the fiscal year and month, respectively, of the actual induction. If the OPC
     is A (Air Force), the third position will be A. For other than Air Force ownership, the third position
     will agree with the OPC available as an attachment to this regulation. The same fiscal year and
     month for a production number won't be allowed with two different OPC.
     1.12.2.3. If the estimate unit cost is less than $15,000 the three-position suffix can be monthly or
     quarterly. The first and second positions will be fiscal year, quarter, and month. The third position
     is the same as in (2) above.
     1.12.2.4. If the estimated unit cost is greater than $15,000 and is not subject to E & I, a monthly
     JON suffix is assigned.
     1.12.2.5. If the estimated unit cost is less than $15,000 and not subject to E & I, a monthly or quar-
     terly JON suffix may be assigned.
     1.12.2.6. All JONs carrying the monthly identifier in the second position of the JON suffix will
     use a coding scheme of A = October, B = November, C = December, D = January, E = February,
     F = March, G = April, H = May, I = June, J = July, K = August, and L = September. Any JON
     carrying the monthly identifier of M can be used in October, November, or December with the
     previous fiscal year for replacement of nonserviceable assets only.
     1.12.2.7. Paragraphs 1.12.2.1. through 1.12.2.5. pertain to the JON suffix structure for all perma-
     nent production numbers and for C and S prefix (with data processing code of P) temporary pro-
     duction numbers. All other temporary jobs will have a quarterly JON suffix assigned by G004L in
     accordance with the current PO number and the applicable data processing code.
18                                                                      AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


        1.12.2.8. When a monthly JON suffix has been established, a quarterly JON suffix won't be
        allowed before the next quarter. When a quarterly JON suffix has been established, a monthly suf-
        fix won’t be allowed before the next quarter.

1.13. Temporary Work Requests.
     1.13.1. Initiation of computer generated AFMC Form 206 by the maintenance is limited to the estab-
     lishment of C prefix PME customer account job orders, S prefix (cost class 4) job orders and T prefix
     (S data processing code) job orders for tenant support. See AFMCMAN 21- 4, Maintenance Workload
     Management System, (for preparation instructions).

1.14. Production and Control.
     1.14.1. Status for Internal M/D Use. The current production status, as of Thursday of each week or the
     end-of-month (EOM), may be obtained for any assigned production number by referencing the end
     item master lists. The master lists are produced in the following sequence and reflect the status of each
     item: Production Number (G004L-G1A), Production Section - Scheduling Designator (G004L-G3A)
     and Stock Number/End Item (G004L-G3B). These lists show the status of all records that are on the
     temporary or permanent JON master files.
     1.14.2. Production Status for Customer Feedback. This action is accomplished through the data con-
     tained on the G004L-L3C.
     1.14.3. Assignment of Permanent Control Numbers:
        1.14.3.1. The assigned portion of the permanent control number register will consist of two mas-
        ter listings and serve two purposes. All control numbers currently assigned will be shown and any
        control number, which doesn’t appear on these lists, is available to be assigned. The JON Master
        List - JON Sequence (G004L-G1A) and the JON Master List - Stock Number End Item Sequence
        (G004L-G3B) is stored electronically and viewed on line.
        1.14.3.2. Permanent control numbers will be computer generated or can be manually established
        to indicate a particular workload TMS/MDS.
     1.14.4. Closing of Permanent Control Numbered JONs. The G004L system, through the use of status
     codes related to actions taken on any specific JON master record, will close a JON master at the end
     of the JON period.
        1.14.4.1. A computer generated 930 transaction; with action code 6 may be used to delete the per-
        manent JON master when the record has no suffix assigned. The G004L system will electronically
        delete these at the following EOM.
NOTE: This action will delete the entire production number, not just the JON Master.
     1.14.5. Assignment of Temporary Production Numbers:
        1.14.5.1. Temporary Production Numbers are assigned electronically when the workloader cor-
        rectly completes the required information, on the AFMC Form 206. A-Prefix. This prefix is used
        only for workloads that will be accomplished off base, with personnel on actual temporary duty.
        Procedures for the use of hourly standards are given in Chapter 2. For work done under a type 7
        PON, the EII must be a CAI. All other A-prefixed work must have a valid MDS/TMS or stock
        number as the end item identity. Only one A-prefixed control number will be set up for each area
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                            19


     technical assistance request. Personnel from support M/D RCCs will be loaned to the responsible
     RCC.
         1.14.5.1.1. For normal TDY job orders, including CLSS, the JOQ should be the total number
         of man-hours required for the TDY requirement.
         1.14.5.1.2. C-Prefix. This prefix is used only for non-M/D PME work that will be done as cost
         class 1. This prefix will be assigned to accumulate production costs to a specific CAI for other
         than the M/D PME. The CAI must be used for all C-prefixed control numbers.
         1.14.5.1.3. M-Prefix. This prefix is used only for local manufacture. This prefix will be
         assigned to all manufacture work except line and cost class 4 support.
         1.14.5.1.4. S-Prefix. This prefix will be assigned only to cost class 4 work, including M/D
         owned PME. This will include all repair and fabrication performed by the direct shops in sup-
         port of the M/D facilities and equipment.
         1.14.5.1.5. T-Prefix. This prefix will be assigned to all temporary repair work done on base
         within the M/D shop and/or all off base modification programs under serial number control.
         For serialized workload, see this instruction Chapter 2.
  1.14.6. When a JON completion is processed in the end item production segment of the G004L sys-
  tem and it completes the JOQ for a temporary production number with a K, N, T, or U data processing
  code, the system will automatically close the JON.
  1.14.7. Production Number Errors. Any opening WAD with errors will be printed out on the
  G004L-L3B and G004L-L3G list. The workloader/planner must correct the input as necessary. Any
  JON master record, once established, will be automatically deleted only when the JOQ and comple-
  tions are equal on temporary JONs or when there have been no inductions on a permanent number at
  the end of the JON period. All temporary JONs (A, M, or T prefix) will close automatically. Tempo-
  rary JONs for tenant support T prefix (DPC = S) and cost class 4 S prefix will close and regenerate
  with the latest labor, material and JOQ. All permanent JONs close at the EOM when all inductions for
  the JON period have been completed.
  1.14.8. Production Numbers for Training (Reimbursable). The WAD will be established using the
  appropriate CAI. The trainer will be considered direct labor and loaned to the RCC in which the labor
  operation is set up. Duty Code 11 will be used. A local special projects shred code may be used if
  desired. The approved RCC rate, which does not include direct material, will be used to compute the
  sales price by G004L. These workloads will use a T prefix production number with job designator N.
  The RGC must be N, reimbursement code of J, L, M, or V, and the PON must be type 6 or 7. The tem-
  porary work request (206) prepared for this work must contain the funding document number in block
  13 (Authority).
  1.14.9. Increased Job Order Quantities (JOQ). Job order quantities input using AFMC Form 206 may
  be increased by the initiator with a changed computer generated Form 206 until such time as Part II of
  AFMC Form 206 is accepted. After that time, increased JOQs will be accepted only on three different
  control numbers: (a) A prefix, (b) S prefix, and (c) T prefix with a DPC of S. Requests for JOQ
  increases should be substantiated with proper documentation. The JOQ of prior year requirements
  cannot be increased.
  1.14.10. File Maintenance of the JON Master File. This will be accomplished per computer generated
  from 930 instructions.
20                                                                     AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


1.15. Project Order Status and Tracking. The criteria applicable to project order management and
control are established in AFMCI 21-111. That does not relieve the workload technician of being aware of
the impact of each WAD as it is inducted to the production process. The foregoing paragraphs are a goal
of day-to-day workload control and each technician must be aware of and responsible for the financial
impact. That impact starts from the point of induction and goes through the sales and project order clo-
sure.

1.16. Sales. The generation of sales is the method used by the DMAG to generate revenue to offset oper-
ating expenses. If the sales values are incorrect in any way, the ability to offset the expenses becomes
questionable. It is, therefore, essential that each sale be consummated at the earliest practical date and be
validated. AFMCI 21-111, outlines the methods used by the G072A data system for making sales (with
the implementation of DMAPS Phase II the G072A is obsolete); AFMCMAN 21-5, Depot Maintenance
Material Support System G005M Users Manual, outlines the methods used by G005M in obtaining the
sales for various comparison purposes. All workloading technicians should be familiar with both of these
cited directives.

1.17. File Maintenance.
     1.17.1. H1 Customer Job Order Release. The workloader technician will coordinate with the cus-
     tomer for each AFMC Form 206 accepted and planned by the M/D, which has the EISP suspended.
     The following jobs don't get the EISP suspended: C & S Prefix JONS. T Prefix JONS serialized
     (except those with DPC = 7) and A Prefix JONS. These exceptions don't require an H1Transaction.
     The G004L system will automatically release the above when the AFMC Form 237 is processed val-
     idly into the system with the Status of Planning Indicator (SOPI) marked complete.
        1.17.1.1. For all M-Prefix and T-Prefix temporary work requests, a customer action is required
        when the EISP exceeds the estimated total job cost. If the customer provides no positive action
        within ten cycles, the EISP will be released, the job will be worked at the higher EISP, and the cus-
        tomer will be billed at the higher cost. If the PON differs from that designated on the initial com-
        puter generated Form 206, it can be changed on the HI transaction by the customer only when the
        job has not been released to M/D scheduling (JON Status Code = blank). Once released to the
        scheduler, the change must be coordinated with the workloader and the appropriate scheduler.
     1.17.2. Cost Class Four Man Hour Summary G004L-F3C. This provides the relationship between the
     performing organization and the owning (requesting) organization. If the owning organization is also
     the performing organization, do not show the relationship. When an RCC does work for itself, no pro-
     duction count is taken and the hours for this work are exceptioned to duty code 24 and reported to
     G037G. Planning will establish this relationship for each cost class 4 AFMC Form 206 processed in
     G004L before issuing the AFMC Form 237 or G004L-L3A list to the shop. Each performing RCC
     must be included in the table. If an owning or performing RCC is deleted from the cost class 4 table,
     it will be coded for delete but will not actually be deleted until the end of month.
NOTE: With the implementation of DMAPS Phase II cost class 4 production count is taken from
DMAPS system

                                    OPERATIONAL PLANNING

Section 2A—PLANNING AND CONTROL

2.1. General. Production Planner (Industrial Engineering Technician), within the Maintenance Director-
ate (M/D) provides the labor and material standards, shop capability, work control documents, and asso-
ciated data to accomplish the production processes. The planning function requires technical knowledge
of data systems, production processing methodology for various end items, ability to interpret directives,
and complete understanding of management objectives related to the Depot Maintenance and Mainte-
nance Support Cost Accounting and Production Reporting System and at AMARC to the applicable sys-
tem. The G004L, Job Order Production Master System, is used to provide the basis for job order costing
by end item identity. The system accounts for end items input to work, accumulates hours earned during
the repair process, and outputs these hours to other data systems for computation of effectiveness. It cre-
ates work in process records and accumulates production units completed for output to G072A at the job
order level, which results in revenue to offset costs incurred. The system provides several data products
for use at different levels of management. These products track production and show work in progress.
Industrial engineering technician will be known as Planner throughout this chapter.

2.2. Relationship With Other Functions. The planning function depends on the workload function, the
scheduling function located throughout the production shops, and the production function of the various
shops which accomplish repair processes or services on end items for which the planning organization is
responsible. (Reference AFMCI 21-110, Depot Maintenance Technical Data and Work Control Docu-
ments).
   2.2.1. Workload Control. The workload function provides requirements for which the repair capabil-
   ity exists, and ensures funds availability and ample lead-time for setting up the basic Job Order Num-
   ber (JON), labor, and material standards (Chapter 1).
   2.2.2. Scheduling. The scheduling function uses the tools provided by planning to ensure proper shop
   loading of end items and manpower, the acquisition of the component parts required by the production
   shops to produce serviceable end items, and a measurement capability of the shop's performance.
   Scheduling personnel are active members of the Preproduction and Production planning teams, and as
   such, support the planning function in the depot production process.
   2.2.3. Production. Production units produce project orders as assigned. The production unit provides
   direct feedback regarding current workload status such as unplanned material requirements, word
   control document, and technical data discrepancies etc. Production personnel are active members of
   the Preproduction and Production planning teams, and as such, support the planning function in the
   depot production process.
   2.2.4. Quality Assurance. The quality assurance function gives quality guidance during preproduction
   and production planning and through work completion. Quality assurance ensures depot maintenance
   produces quality products.

2.3. Responsibilities. Each planning organization within each production division accomplishes the fol-
lowing:
22                                                                    AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     2.3.1. Participates in and coordinates on workload negotiations as required. Organizations utilizing
     EXPRESS do not negotiate workloads.
     2.3.2. Performs Pre-Production Planning and serves as the chairperson of the production planning
     team.
     2.3.3. Provides cost estimates and source selection support, provides technical inputs to decision tree
     analysis and interservice studies.
     2.3.4. Provides logistics planning support to the acquisition process for weapon systems and end
     items.
     2.3.5. Identifies and justifies Contract Engineering and Technical Services (CETS) requirements.
     2.3.6. Provides production planning for current workloads.
     2.3.7. Prepares and or coordinates, processes, and provides follow-up on all technical data change
     requests forwarded to the responsible agency.
     2.3.8. Prepares and maintains work authorization and work control documents.
     2.3.9. Develops and maintains resource standards for labor and material.
     2.3.10. Performs periodic labor standard reviews on permanent workloads. Reference AFMCI
     21-105.
        2.3.10.1. Develops task sequences including workbooks and station instructions, compatible with
        tech data, work requirements, and work specifications.
        2.3.10.2. Ensures Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) standards are incorporated in the
        design of all repair processes.
     2.3.11. Provides management consulting services.
     2.3.12. Reviews and coordinates on actions of Material Review Boards (MRBs).
     2.3.13. Initiates/coordinates and reviews proposals for equipment, products, and industrial processes
     to determine application and acceptability.
        2.3.13.1. Assists in determining requirements and establishing justification for division modern-
        ization projects and programs.
        2.3.13.2. Provides Planning support as required during the development and implementation of
        new technologies, and reviews new industrial processes for impact to the current production pro-
        cess. Updates associated logistics data Process Flow Charts, Labor Standard, Flow Day computa-
        tions and etc.
        2.3.13.3. Provides Planning support to safety and health related programs as needed.

2.4. Preproduction Planning (New Work Loads).
     2.4.1. Absolute Prerequisite. Production planning is an absolute prerequisite to establishing a suc-
     cessful depot repair process. It is done after Technology Repair Center (TRC) workload assignment
     and before a new weapon system becomes operational or at least concurrently with the operational
     phase. When TRC workload assignments are transferred from one ALC to another, some preproduc-
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                                 23


   tion planning is required by the receiving TRC, for a smooth and efficient transfer with minimum
   impact on customer requirements.
   2.4.2. Pre-production Planning, New Workload Assignment. For each new programmed (negotiated)
   workload end item, according to AFMCI 21- 110, the directorate of maintenance will establish
   pre-production planning teams composed of representatives from Production, Scheduling, Quality
   Assurance and Planning. When additional expertise is desired, other organizations possessing the
   skills required may be included. These additional members may serve on either a full-or part-time
   basis. The lead planning technician or designated alternate will chair the team. Pre-production person-
   nel are responsible for the initial resource development and system input of workplace facility layouts,
   process flow charts, bills of material requirements, work structure breakdowns and associated work
   control documents, labor standard operations, identification of training and certification requirements
   for production personnel, overseeing all prototype first article demonstrations, review all hardware
   and software technical data, review of all associated equipment and hand tools, review of all special
   processes, finalization of direct costs, reporting of shortfalls that prohibit organic start and requesting
   work authorization documents for programmed workload start. Time line for support of this function
   may begin as far out as five (5) years on new acquisition weapons systems, or as close as one (1) year
   on depot transfers.
NOTE: It is important that this planning chairperson have a thorough working knowledge of the
maintenance industrial repair process. In addition, a thorough understanding of all maintenance
organizations and their responsibility to each other is required. This person should also have a
working knowledge of the responsibilities of the M/D and Supply as they relate to the repair/over-
haul process.
   2.4.3. Ongoing Preproduction Planning. Preproduction planning will also be applied to:
      2.4.3.1. New major end item repair requirements that generate after the initial TRC assignment.
      These items may be the result of modification, product improvement, or engineering change pro-
      posals.
      2.4.3.2. Major modification requirements may be of such magnitude and sophistication as to
      require the effort of a preproduction planning team. Under those conditions, the responsible plan-
      ner will take the necessary action to call other team members into action.
      2.4.3.3. Safety of flight, life support of quality assurance verification requirements. When items
      have been identified as a safety of flight, loss of life support item, or quality assurance verification
      requirements, they will receive formal preproduction planning team coordination as it applies to
      Work Control Document (WCD) preparation before work. Refer to AFMCI 21-110.
      2.4.3.4. Depot Field Team (DFT) activities, special planning may be required depending on the
      tasks that will be done in the field by DFT. Therefore, WCDs are developed and used during kit
      proofing of and modification that will be done in the field. Other work done in the field by the
      DFT will be planned and will result in a planned package that will contain all required specific
      operations and quality verification inspection requirements. (Reference AFMCI 21-120, Organic
      Depot Field Teams).
   2.4.4. One or more preplanning teams will be established for each division designated to perform
   repairs. The magnitude of pre-production planning is determined by the complexity of the weapon
   system/end item and by the requirements established and negotiated by the responsible Weapon Sys-
   tem Program Manager/Item Manager (WSPM/IM). Planning has the basic responsibility for prepro-
24                                                                      AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     duction planning; therefore, the planner serves as chairperson of the preproduction planning team.
     The team will:
        2.4.4.1. Identify RCC manning requirements, as required. Identify the total required versus avail-
        able manpower by required skill level and RCC. The total standard hours required versus the total
        manpower available by skills is the basis for determining the depot's manpower capability to
        accomplish the programmed workload by the desired date. Any new manpower requirements will
        be identified in terms of personnel equivalents. To accomplish this, it will be necessary to develop
        labor standards for those items processed within a given RCC.
        2.4.4.2. Identify tool, equipment, ground handling, and mockup requirements, as required.
        Review all applicable technical data and determine the availability and adequacy of the above
        items. Identify any items that aren't available locally and take steps to ensure they will be on hand
        in time to support the programmed workload. Identify the workload to be applied across common
        test equipment; and, as a result of that finding, determine the number of test set/stations required
        to provide support for a smooth repair-line flow. When bottlenecks occur or when a 3-shift opera-
        tion won't satisfy negotiated requirements, take action to obtain additional test equipment or test
        stations not provided for initially.
        2.4.4.3. Identify facility requirements, as required. Review the technical data and flow process
        requirements to determine whether or not existing facilities are adequate for the proposed work-
        load. Consider any peculiar needs such as light, heat, power, water, ventilation, floor drains, com-
        pressed air, cleaning booths, paint booths, clean room, noise suppression, special safety
        considerations, etc. Take action to ensure peculiar facility needs are provided in time to support
        the programmed workload.
            2.4.4.3.1. A layout of work areas by RCC is required. Prepare area layout drawings with floor
            space required, showing all workbenches and the location of equipment, test stations,
            machines, utilities, etc., as required.
        2.4.4.4. Determine repair requirements. Repair requirements should be an integral part of the
        project directive, work order Statement of Work (SOW) as applicable. Preproduction planning
        team should ensure that these requirements are clearly stated and tech data covering these require-
        ments is available. Technical data will be reviewed; homogeneous end items assigned to given
        RCCs, and flow process charts developed for each item. The team will identify and establish ship-
        ping/receiving areas as end item storage for each RCC. Storage will accommodate those items
        AWM or AWP. A first article/prototype inspection will be scheduled and walk-through disassem-
        bly/assembly will be accomplished to:
            2.4.4.4.1. Verify the repair process.
            2.4.4.4.2. Determine the proper sequence of disassembly/assembly.
            2.4.4.4.3. Determine, which subindentured items, will be repaired/replaced.
            2.4.4.4.4. Determine which subindentured items will be routed, for what purpose and at what
            frequency. (Identify support RCCs required and manpower for each).
            2.4.4.4.5. Identify all items to be processed across the same test equipment/test station(s) and
            locate that equipment/test station(s) within the plant so as to be readily accessible to all or most
            of the related repair lines. Identify and quantify any additional equipment/test stations required
            to support the programmed workload.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                             25


        2.4.4.4.6. Validate the use of designated ground handling equipment, special tools, test equip-
        ment, etc.
        2.4.4.4.7. Determine quantities and types of skills required not formerly identified.
        2.4.4.4.8. Determine standard man-hours required for removal or installation.
        2.4.4.4.9. Determine the number of people required for removal or installation.
        2.4.4.4.10. Identify any required special tools, equipment etc, not previously identified.
        2.4.4.4.11. Determine what inspection requirements and quality verification is necessary dur-
        ing repair/installation.
        2.4.4.4.12. Prepare, by RCC, a list of nonprogrammed type items that may be routed in sup-
        port of nonprogrammed end item workload.
        2.4.4.4.13. Determine probable frequency of item 2.4.4.4.4. above.
        2.4.4.4.14. Determine probable work to be done by those support shops identified in 1 above
        (that is, bench check, minor repair, Technical Order Compliance (TOC), etc).
        2.4.4.4.15. Identify the exchange items that require turn in for movement to the responsible
        technical repair center/source of repair (TRC/SOR). This is considered a remove and replace
        concept due to TRC/SOR assignment to another location.
     2.4.4.5. Develop a Quality Assurance plan. All commodities and work areas covered by estab-
     lished quality assurance methods. The development of a planned quality assurance plan is an inte-
     gral part of the preproduction planning function. For those activities, which are exceptions, quality
     assurance coverage is discussed in AFMCI 21-108, Maintenance Training and Production Accep-
     tance Certification (PAC). The quality assurance representative, with the planning activity, will
     develop and refine the planned quality assurance plan according to AFMCI 21-115, Depot Main-
     tenance Quality Assurance (QA).
     2.4.4.6. Develop production control requirements. Develop material standards for each end item
     programmed for repair. Should formal -4 parts breakdown TOs not be available, blue line -4s or
     provisioning documents may be used to identify parts for material standard development (Refer-
     ence AFMCI 21-130 and AFMCMAN 21-5). Labor standards will be developed from blue line
     copies of the -3 overhaul TOs if the formal -3s are not yet published. Work control documents will
     be developed and validated during the first article/prototype inspection. Work control document
     inspection points and required support shop routes will be identified and provided for.
     2.4.4.7. Ensure proper technical data is available in sufficient quantity to support the scheduled
     repair. The preproduction planning team will review preliminary technical data and make the nec-
     essary changes to provide adequate repair coverage. They will also review the preliminary illus-
     trated parts breakdown data to ensure all replaceable parts are identified. In addition to the depot
     overhaul technical data reviews pertaining to the items scheduled for repair, the team will also
     ensure (where appropriate) that the test station data will be available and adequate to support oper-
     ation and maintenance. Note: A production technician should be present when technical data, test
     station data, or process procedures are being discussed.
26                                                                   AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


        2.4.4.8. Determine shop and quality personnel training requirements. As a result of technical data
        review and the first article/prototype inspection, the team will determine any shop training
        requirements that need to be accomplished before starting the repair schedule.
        2.4.4.9. Determine Special Safety Consideration and Requirements.

2.5. Production Planning. Production planning is started upon receipt of the document authorizing the
accomplishment of workloads as described in Chapter 1.
     2.5.1. Labor Standards. The appropriate planning activity ensures adequate labor standards are devel-
     oped to do the work. AFMCI 21-105 gives procedures for developing permanent labor standards.
     2.5.2. Material Standards. Material standards are developed by the appropriate planning activity and
     are used to calculate material requirements for a given workload. Each workload assigned a perma-
     nent production number established in G004L system must be evaluated for component material items
     to be used in the repair process. Material standards are then prepared and input to the G005M system.
     These standards are an integral part of the Uniform Cost Accounting System and provide a means to
     compute an End Item Sales Price (EISP) AFMCMAN 21-5, for temporary workload.
     2.5.3. Work Control Documents. The Work Control Document (WCD) is used to provide portrayal
     and use of technical information, identification, item movement, and routing. The objective of the
     WCD is to ensure quality and proper control of required maintenance. A WCD will be developed for
     all programmed and temporary workloads except some tenant support, PME and preventive mainte-
     nance type support work, Aircraft Workload Control as defined in AFMCI 21-133, Depot Mainte-
     nance Management for Aircraft Repair and for mechanized temporary workload control documents
     defined in preceding paragraphs. Work Control Documents will be developed and implemented IAW
     this instruction, AFMCI 21-110, and local Operating Instruction (OI) Policy and Procedures.
        2.5.3.1. Types of Work Control Document:
            2.5.3.1.1. AFMC Form 959, Work Control Document..
            2.5.3.1.2. ITS, Inventory Tracking System (G337 System).
            2.5.3.1.3. AFMC Form 173, MDS/Project Operation Assignment.
            2.5.3.1.4. D012, Management, Planning and Control System (MPCS).
            2.5.3.1.5. AMARC uses MAXIMO computer generated WCDs.
        2.5.3.2. The assigned RCC Planning Organization is responsible for WCD specified task per-
        formed within their respective area(s) of responsibility. When the responsible RCC Planning orga-
        nization is not the primary organization for the WCD (Imbedded Process Routes), the
        production-planning technician responsible for the RCC where the task is performed will notify
        the primary WCD Planner of required WCD changes.
     2.5.4. Move Item Control. When a maintenance organization requires support in the repair of end
     items from organizations outside the primary Resource Control Center (RCC) coordination between
     the primary and supporting organization is essential. Locally developed Move Item Control Docu-
     ments such as OC-ALC Form 238 may be used to request and coordinate support within the product
     management directorates. Policy, Instructions, and procedures for use of Move Item Control docu-
     ments will be governed by locally developed publications, Instructions, OI’s and etc.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                                 27


   2.5.5. Non-programmed Workload. Prepare an AFMC Form 237 for each non-programmed work
   request. A Work Control Document will be prepared for this type work and sent to the quality assur-
   ance specialist to determine any quality verification inspection requirements. The system will output
   a Temporary Job Record (G004L-L3A). In addition, on a selected basis, there may be times when a
   non-programmed work request is of such a magnitude or nature as to require the effort of a pre-pro-
   duction planning team. Under those conditions, the planner will determine the need and take action as
   required.
       2.5.5.1. Safety of flight. The WCD requires formal pre-production planning team coordination
       before work can begin.
       2.5.5.2. Nonsafety of flight. The WCD may be handscribed by the planner and will not require
       formal pre-production planning team coordination and signoff before work unless the magnitude
       or nature of the work requires total pre-production planning as identified by the customer or deter-
       mined by the planner.
   2.5.6. Programmed Work. An AFMC 600D transaction is completed for each end item identified as a
   requirement. This workload is presented to maintenance by a project directive from the M/D. If the
   annual requirement is for ten or less, nonengineered labor standards and Low Volume Workload Bills
   of Material or Expense Standard may be input (See AFMCMAN 21-5 and AFMCI 21-105). In addi-
   tion, formal preproduction planning of the WCD isn't required for items with an annual requirement of
   ten or less unless it is a safety of flight item or the magnitude or nature of the work requires total pre-
   production planning as identified by the customer or determined by the planner.

2.6. Support Shop Application. Items removed from an end item or weapon system and forwarded to a
support shop for repair as an operation on the same job order number aren’t considered as a route. Use
AFMC Form 127, Routed Order or WCD as the move document.
   2.6.1. Routing is the removal, repair/reconditioning, and reinstallation of a subcomponent, while
   excluding supply from the process. Conversely, a non-routing process is a strictly remove and replace
   operation. Routing may involve multiple Resource Control Centers, or may occur within a single
   shop. Routing may be classified as either Job routing or Process-routing. The decision rules for deter-
   mining Job & Process routing is defined in AFMCI 21-129).
       2.6.1.1. Process routing is the movement of an item (Exchangeable, Non-Exchangeable) through
       a conditioning/reconditioning process. Typical process routes are defined as follows:
          2.6.1.1.1. Cleaning
          2.6.1.1.2. Plating
          2.6.1.1.3. Heat Treating
          2.6.1.1.4. Battery Servicing
          2.6.1.1.5. Grinding
          2.6.1.1.6. Machining
          2.6.1.1.7. Check & Testing
       2.6.1.2. Job-routing is similar to process routing, except that the repair does not involve a
       sequence of conditioning processes. Job routing consists of removal, repair, and reinstallation of a
28                                                                     AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


        Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) without including a supply transaction in the process. Job routing is
        not permitted between ALC’s. The proper procedure is to exchange the unserviceable for a ser-
        viceable with a supply transaction. If serviceable assets are unavailable in supply, supply will for-
        ward the asset to the appropriate repair shop for serviceable conditioning and reissue.
     2.6.2. Items removed for accessibility purposes will be reinstalled, without exception, on the end item
     from which removed.
     2.6.3. Where direct material is required for support shops on permanent production numbers, it is nec-
     essary that a material standard be input to the G005M system.
     2.6.4. Unserviceable exchangeable components from aircraft and engines are normally removed,
     turned into supply, and a serviceable replacement acquired (AFMCI 21-129, AFMCI 21-130, and
     AFMCI 21-133). Exchangeable components are processed according to AFMCI 21-129.
     2.6.5. To ensure the M/D recoups operating costs under the industrial fund (see AFMCR 66-40, Pol-
     icies and Procedures for Customers of the Depot Maintenance Service, Air Force Industrial Fund
     (DMS, AFIF) and AFMCI 21-111) for the production of each end item, timely reporting of all support
     must be affected. Selected types of workload, including items removed from complete aircraft, com-
     plete missiles, and complete engines under modular control, or inertia, guidance systems, require
     serial number reporting. One AFMC Form 959, /ITS must be prepared for each item (one of a kind)
     identified to a serial number controlled end item. Multiple items of a like stock number moved from
     the same serial number end item may be included on one AFMC Form 959/ITS document.
     2.6.6. All direct material transactions used in support of moved items will contain the 9-position JON
     of the supported end item. This data is mandatory to comply with G004H costing of material by JON,
     reporting requirements, supply posting control, stock balance reporting procedures, and material stan-
     dard refinement.
     2.6.7. Data, contained on AFMC Forms 127/959/ITS, is required to ensure proper control of all sup-
     port work; to ensure required maintenance; and to ensure return of the items to the final destination.
     AFMC Forms 137/959/ITS are used as movement tags. AFMC Forms 127/959 may be initiated by M/
     D production personnel for battery and hydrostatic services when accomplished for resident organiza-
     tions (fire department, air base group, directorate of distribution, etc.) All WCD prepared by produc-
     tion will be verified by Planning and Quality personnel. Preparation of AFMC Forms 959/ITS WCDs
     will be IAW AFMCI 21-110.
     2.6.8. Preprinting of AFMC Form 127. When preplanning has established the necessary support on
     programmed workloads, preprinting of AFMC Form 127 may be done. Entries that may be preprinted
     are:
        2.6.8.1. Block 1 - Enter the control number and job designator and the control number portion
        only. Use the job designator portion to insert the JON suffix/aircraft identity code.
        2.6.8.2. Blocks 3, 5, 7, 9, 11a, 12, 13a and b, and 14 may be completed, if known.
     2.6.9. Routed Order (Aircraft) (AFMC Form 127).

2.7. Cost Awareness. The planner ensures proper costing through finite planning of the labor, material
required and WCD preparation. AFMC Forms 959/ITSs are used as the WCD for negotiated workloads
and permanent control numbers are assigned. End item prices will be included in the JONs (except serial
number controlled items), and an average hourly sales rate/end item price for temporary JONs dependent
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                                29


upon the UOM. The planner will review these prices/rates to determine when a change is required as the
intent under the DMAG is to break even. Good planning will result in a break-even position and an effi-
cient shop operation.
   2.7.1. Temporary JONs. The planner prepares and inputs the labor plan and the (Bill of Material)
   BOM to the Maintenance Workload Management System. The system will output the Temporary Job
   Record (G004L-L3A) containing all pertinent control data, the man-hour cost for A-prefix control
   numbered JONs, and end item price for M-prefix JONs. Based upon the UOM, the system will com-
   pute an average hour P sales rate or end item price for T-prefix JONs. The planner must review these
   documents to ensure completeness before release to scheduling.
       2.7.1.1. Various computations must be made by G004L to provide an end item sales price (EISP)
       or an average hourly sales rate. Funded material is known as expense (nonexchange) material. On
       temporary job orders, cost code is A and 100 percent of stocklist price is used. Unfunded material
       is known as exchange (investment) material. Cost codes applicable are D/E/M/T/X or Z codes.
       Cost code E is costed at the average repair cost. Cost codes M/D/T/X and Z are costed at 100 per-
       cent of the stocklist price. The computer will do the computation based upon planning input. For
       cost codes M/D/T/X or Z, the unfunded material cost by operation equals the stocklist price times
       the material quantity. For cost code E, the unfunded material cost per operation equals the stocklist
       price times the material quantity times average repair cost. To compute the labor cost per opera-
       tion, multiply the operation count limit times the operation standard hours times the RCC rate
       (provided by the G004C system).
       2.7.1.2. To compute an end item price (for all jobs with UOM equal to EA), G004L will summa-
       rize the total funded material cost, and other direct cost, summarize the total labor cost, add the
       two summary figures, and divide that result by the job order quantity (JOQ).
       2.7.1.3. To compute an average hourly rate (for all jobs with the UOM equal to HR), G004L will
       summarize the total funded material cost, the total labor cost, the other direct costs, and divide the
       result by the total labor hours for the job.
       2.7.1.4. Recomputation of the hourly sales rate or EISP is required for all temporary JONs when
       any element affects the cost of a labor operation (such as added or deleted material from an oper-
       ation) or when the total job quantity is changed. When a new labor operation is added in a new
       RCC, the current rate for that RCC as provided by G004C is used. All other computations are
       made using the applicable RCC rate in existence at the time the record for the labor operation was
       set up on the master record.
           2.7.1.4.1. Establishing and Revising AFMC Form 206. Sample screens and instructions are as
           follows:

     2.7.2. Permanent JONs. The G004L system will interface to the G072A system for existing perma-
     nent JONs. For new workloads, the planner must compute the EISP based upon known labor and
     material planned for each end item and input this price to the G004L system by AFMC Form 600D
     transaction. Note: With the implementation of DMAPS Phase II, G072A is obsolete.
        2.7.2.1. Establishing a Permanent JON Workload. The forms used for workload management are
        computer screens generated by the Maintenance Workload Management System (MWMS). Sam-
        ples and process procedures to open new workload in MWMS are as follows:
           2.7.2.1.1. The Actual NSN is the item that will be produced. The Master NSN is used for fill-
           ing linked requirements and does not necessarily have an open Control Number. If any Modi-
           fication NSNs are listed, they must be modified to the Actual NSN before being sold.
           2.7.2.1.2. Determine work requirements. If no prototype was performed within the last two
           years another may be required. Make sure all Support Equipment, Technical Data, Material,
           Skills, Routed Support, etc., are available before accepting the work. This is a function of the
           planning team.
           2.7.2.1.3. Determine an estimated End Item Sales Price (EISP). This price cannot be changed
           for about 2 years, so it should be as accurate as possible and also anticipate future events. The
           EISP is calculated by multiplying the Standard Hours by the RCC Labor Rate and adding the
           material cost. The material cost is calculated by multiplying the price of each line item on the
           Bill of Materials by the Units per Assembly and by the replacement percentage and then total-
           ing them up. The EISP includes all routed labor and material support required. Preliminary
           Labor Standards may be established in the E046B system using Control Number 09888A. Pre-
           liminary Bills of Materials may be established in the G005M system using a P Job Designator.
           2.7.2.1.4. Complete AFMC 600D transaction, Screen AB4055, ESTABLISH WORK
           AUTHORIZATION (MISTR), to establish end item in G004L. Prior to sending 600D to
           G004L, annotate Special Instructions, Screen AB4042, with Part Number and Technical Data
           requirements.
           2.7.2.1.5. Complete planning tasks. This includes completing the Labor Standards, Bill of
           Materials, Work Control Documents, Routed Support requests, etc. The AFMC Form 600D
           must be completed and overlay the E046B and G005M systems before Labor Standards and
           Bills of Material can be input.
           2.7.2.1.6. When all planning tasks are complete, send to Workloading and open Control Num-
           ber in G019C. Before sending to Workloading, annotate Special Instructions, Screen AB4042,
           with implementation date. This date is the date that all elements will be ready for the shop to
           start work.

2.8. Data Reliability. The planner provides complete labor and material plans for the job processes
required to complete one unit of sales. This data is used to compute labor effectiveness for the accom-
plishing organization(s), to compute EISP and average hourly sales rates, and to measure the profit/loss
position of the depot at any organizational level. The data is used by several interfacing data systems and,
as a result, is entered into the DD-I & L (A) 397 Depot Maintenance Cost and Production report at the
work performance category level (job designator) with dollar costs. Proper planning allows proper report-
ing and visibility afterward to enable management to make decisions on the disposition of weapons sys-
tems/end items.

2.9. Control of Manufacture at the ALC. Manufacture is the fabrication of an item through the appli-
cation of labor, machines, and tools to material. During manufacture, raw (general purpose) material is
transformed into an item with a specific form, fit and function.
     2.9.1. Authorization to Manufacture. Items to be manufactured must meet at least one of the follow-
     ing criteria:
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                             39


     2.9.1.1. Organic accomplishment is necessary for the Air Force to maintain an in-service depot
     maintenance capability for mission-essential items as provided by AFI 21-102, Depot Mainte-
     nance Management.
     2.9.1.2. Acquisition of the part from a commercial source will result in higher cost to the Air
     Force.
     2.9.1.3. The product or service isn't available through interservice or other Federal agencies.
     2.9.1.4. Acquisition from private commercial sources will disrupt or materially delay an Air
     Force program.
     2.9.1.5. A satisfactory commercial source isn't available and can't be developed in time to provide
     the part when needed.
  2.9.2. U/MM Function. For stock listed P coded items (procured by stock number requisition) are
  managed by the Air Force. Stock listed M coded items (M code is manufacture) are processed through
  Supply for action.
     2.9.2.1. When stock listed items are to be routinely provided through manufacture, they will be
     identified through source coding. The equipment specialist codes these items for either organiza-
     tional level manufacture (Code MO), Field Manufacture (Code MF) or Depot Manufacture (Code
     MD). Generally, these items are limited to low usage or casual replacement type items that are
     more economical and practical to manufacture than they are to acquire, store and distribute for
     use. The manufacture of such items generally enhances the logistics support process and results in
     greater economy.
     2.9.2.2. The decision to manufacture stock listed items not source coded MO, MF or MD, is made
     on a case-by-case basis by the item manager/equipment specialist only on AF-managed items.
     2.9.2.3. Other items aren't stock listed because failure or a recurring demand for their replacement
     hasn't been anticipated. Normally, these items will be manufactured until sufficient information
     becomes available to warrant cataloging action and making a source-coding decision.
  2.9.3. ALC Maintenance Guidelines. Since the basic responsibility for manufacture rests with the M/
  D, the M/D may undertake manufacture only when a properly completed work request is received
  from Supply.
     2.9.3.1. The basic source for all material requirements is Supply. Accordingly, all material
     requests will be submitted to Supply. This includes material requests that are likely to be satisfied
     through depot maintenance manufacture.
     2.9.3.2. Supply will review all material requests from the M/D, tenants, and other organizations
     they support, and will determine the proper source of supply. When source coding doesn't exist,
     consultation with the appropriate M/D may be required. When Supply determines that manufac-
     ture is the proper source of supply, they will process an AFMC Form 206 to the M/D for the man-
     ufacture.
     2.9.3.3. The M/D will manufacture and upon completion turn in the materials to Supply. The
     requesting appropriation will be billed for the labor, raw material, and indirect/overhead expenses.
     2.9.3.4. Manufactured items issued by Supply to the M/D will be charged to the using job order as
     material using the D035 issue price.
40                                                                   AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     2.9.4. Line Support Manufacture:
        2.9.4.1. NSN Items Coded for Manufacture:
            2.9.4.1.1. The D035 system will maintain demand data for NSN items source coded for man-
            ufacture in the same manner as items having another source of supply. When the demand is
            sufficiently recurring, a stock level and reorder point will be computed. Supply will maintain
            this stock level by submitting AFMC Forms 206 to the M/D for the required manufacture.
            2.9.4.1.2. Material standards maintained in the G005M system won't influence the Supply
            stockage of NSN items source coded for manufacture. However, material standards are
            required for use in computing the sales prices of the using end item.
        2.9.4.2. Local manufacture for line support of one-time requirements (nonrecurring) on serialized
        workloads, when included in the work package negotiated with the M/D or approved by the
        Project Administration Officer for over-and-above accomplishment, does not require the process-
        ing of AFMC Form 206. This line support may be accomplished as a labor operation on the JON
        applicable to the end item and worked under the G037E system. Prepare a handscribed AFMC
        Form 173, MDS/Project Operation, or AFMC Form 127. This AFMC Form 127/173 may be use
        by the supporting shop for processing the manufacturing requirement. The analysis of unpredict-
        able operations will also be used to determine recurrence and, when applicable, will be used as the
        basis for preparing AFMC Form 206.
     2.9.5. Work Authorization:
        2.9.5.1. All manufacture requests submitted on AFMC Forms 206 must have AFMC Forms 206
        and 237 processed validly by the G004L system before work may begin. The AFMC Form 206
        establishes the basic authority to accomplish manufacture. The AFMC form 237 and AFMC Form
        240, Temporary Labor and Material Plan Addendum, provide the labor and material data
        required for costing.
        2.9.5.2. Issue a separate JON according to DOD 7220.29H, Depot Maintenance Support Cost
        Accounting and Production Reporting Handbook, for the manufacture of an item. Prepare AFMC
        Form 237 using an M control number prefix and K job designator. Input of the AFMC Form 237
        to the G004L system will result in the automatic assignment of the JON suffix based upon the
        computer processing date with Status of Planning Indicator (SOPI) marked Complete (C). The
        End Item Identity (EII) will be by NSN or NC, ND, or part number (FSC, P in position 5, followed
        by the item part number).
     2.9.6. Pricing. The G004L system will compute a unit price for each unit of the JON quantity when
     the SOPI is marked Complete (C). The UOM is always Each (EA). Update of the D035K record by
     tape interface from G004L.

2.10. Local Manufacture of Equipment.
     2.10.1. All M/D proposals for the local manufacture of depot maintenance shop equipment must be
     prepared by the appropriate engineering and planning offices and submitted through the responsible
     equipment custodian to the Installation Equipment Management Office (IEMO) on AF Form 601,
     Equipment Action Request.
     2.10.2. In compliance with AFMCI 21-109, Support and Industrial Operations Depot Facilities and
     Equipment actions by the IEMO will be based on the following:
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                               41


       2.10.2.1. The manufacture of stock listed local manufacture equipment items prescribed by allow-
       ance documents will be authorized and controlled as prescribed by those documents.
       2.10.2.2. Stock catalog data will be researched by IEMO Research Unit to determine if a standard
       locally or centrally acquired item will meet the requirements for non-stock listed equipment items
       instead of local manufacture.
       2.10.2.3. The manufacture of non-stock listed items is contingent upon IEMO approval when the
       estimated unit cost is less than $249,999.99 and upon Command Equipment Management Office
       (CEMO) approval when the estimate cost is $250,000 or more. Approval requires that adequate
       justification be provided by the M/D on the AF Form 601 request submitted to the IEMO.
       2.10.2.4. Non-stock listed equipment items may be authorized for local manufacture when the M/
       D existing resources are adequate and any of the following occur:
           2.10.2.4.1. The equipment is required to meet a locally unique requirement.
           2.10.2.4.2. The use of spares and related accessories is required by technical order to perform
           maintenance checks or repairs.
           2.10.2.4.3. An emergency condition exists and the equipment is required to preclude an
           adverse effect on mission accomplishment.
   2.10.3. If the local manufacture request is approved, an AFMC Form 206 will be processed to the M/
   D by Supply. After the manufacture of the equipment item, the M/D will contact Supply for disposi-
   tion instructions. The use of an L number in the EII field is mandatory when the end item being man-
   ufactured has an assigned ERRC code of either S or U.
   2.10.4. Costs associated with the local manufacture of equipment will be treated as follows:
       2.10.4.1. The unit price entered into supply records determines whether the manufactured item is
       expense or investment equipment. If the unit price is less than $249,999.99 the item will be classi-
       fied as expense equipment and it is a stock fund item. If the unit price is $250,000 or more, the
       item will he classified as investment equipment and it is a non-stock-fund item.
       2.10.4.2. The unit price of locally manufactured equipment consists of the actual manufacturing
       cost of the unit, plus the supply surcharge.
       2.10.4.3. The actual unit cost is computed from planning data entered on AFMC Form 237 by the
       G004L system before the manufacture of the equipment item. In rare cases, the computed cost
       may result in a change in the original classification of an item as either expense or investment
       equipment. When this occurs, action must be taken to cancel and reinitiate all actions related to the
       item.
       2.10.4.4. The DMAG will bill the customer for the actual manufacturing cost.

2.11. Control of Quarterly Sales of End Items. Once the quarterly sales indicator (QSI) has been
assigned, it cannot be changed through a simple file maintenance action. For example, if the QSI for a
specific serial number record must be changed from M to C, a new production number must be estab-
lished as well as a new serial number record with the new QSI = C.

2.12. Exchangeable Component Item Control. The basis for pricing end items is determined 12-15
months in advance of the actual generation of those items for repair. Because of this time-phasing and the
42                                                                       AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


necessity of establishing the pricing rates some 14 months in advance of workload generation, the cus-
tomer has no reliable visibility of serviceable component availability, nor can maintenance rely upon such
availability when establishing their labor standards for repair of the end items. These situations force con-
sideration of concurrent repair of exchangeable components. The M/D is responsible for disposing of the
exchangeable components, and concurrent repair of these items must be approved by the M/D. Repair
concepts for exchangeable items are normally agreed upon between the material management and M/D
during the initial preproduction planning accomplished after TRC assignment or when new major end
item repair requirements are made known through major modification/engineering change. Those require-
ments may be of such magnitude or sophistication as to require a preproduction planning effort. That pre-
planning effort will determine and establish the repair process of those agreed upon items; and will remain
in effect unless those items, subsequently, become in serviceable long supply.
     2.12.1. Job Routed Items (Exchange Items). When the M/D is notified by the material management
     that items have become in serviceable long supply (sufficient quantities to meet demand), they will
     make every effort to change the repair concept to a remove and replace policy, which will require
     establishment of those items on the applicable end item material standard, in order to preposition suf-
     ficient assets to support the repair program. Those items will then be removed, turned in to supply, and
     replaced with a like serviceable item until serviceable long supply assets no longer exist, at which
     time the original repair concept will be reinstituted. During the in serviceable long supply period (suf-
     ficient quantities to meet demand), assets will be ordered on a fill or kill requisition (when sufficient
     quantities do not exist the requisition will be killed and item will be routed for repair). Should the req-
     uisition be killed, the M/D (scheduling) will immediately contact the PM/IM and mutually determine
     whether or not concurrent repair may be employed. There are exceptions to the remove and replace
     concept as indicated above, predicated upon the number and location of the long supply assets. When-
     ever the repair/schedule is jeopardized by the inability to obtain long supply assets, concurrent repair
     may be accomplished with concurrence of the M/D and the PM/IM. Any agreement to perform con-
     current repair of long supply assets will be documented by the M/D (scheduling and material function)
     and filed by the responsible planner in the pertinent planning jacket file.
     2.12.2. MISTR IPP 72-10 Repair. (Incorporate FEEMS policy) (Non-Job-Routed). Non Job-Routed
     (NJR) concept is the procedure for repairing the Next-Higher Assembly (NHA) and the subindentured
     items separately. Each has its own labor and material standard for the repair process. The reparable
     subindentured item is removed, turned into supply, and replaced with a like serviceable item (remove
     and replace except PP 72-10 items). If an NJR item cannot be supported from supply and the repair
     capability exists at the source of repair (SOR), repair can be accomplished concurrently with the NHA
     and funded on an AFMC Form 206. If the SOR for the NJR item is collocated, the item may be trans-
     ferred to the MISTR Line using 971 transaction, Maintenance Production Transactions, or a 244 trans-
     action, Material Request/Turn In/Custody Receipt, as appropriate. If the MISTR control number has a
     DPC = X (engines), a 971 transaction will be used. If the MISTR control number has a DPC = T, then
     the item will be wash posted on a 244 transaction. When non-job routed items are identified as in-ser-
     viceable long supply it will be the prime PM/IM responsibility to terminate depot repair of those
     items, by canceling or decreasing repair requirements as may be needed on any project directive or
     MISTR requirements, as may be appropriate. When serviceable long supply assets no longer exist,
     Production Management (PM)/Item Manager (IM) will initiate action to reestablish any pertinent
     project directive or MISTR requirements. PP 72-10 FEEMS items, required to support engine repair,
     that have been identified as in serviceable long supply will be placed on the engine material standard
     and ordered on a fill or kill requisition. Any deviation from this policy will require the necessary head-

   quarters approval IAW AFMCI 21-129. If killed, an operation number may be established against the
   engine control number to accomplish the necessary repair; however the (scheduler) will contact the
   PM/IM to obtain the necessary approval to do the repair. Documentation will then be filed in the
   appropriate planner's jacket file.
   2.12.3. Field Level Repair. This type repair, when done in support of serialized end items, should be
   costed as over and-above work to the end item with the approval of the Project Administrative Officer
   (PAO) (Reference AFMCI 21-111) normally, a block of hours per end item will be identified for this
   type effort. Once repair on a component has been made by the maintenance activity, and the compo-
   nent leaves maintenance, but subsequently fails for reasons other than material failure, any follow-on
   repair of that item will be costed as rework. The labor and material used in rework are charged to oper-
   ations overhead in the RCC doing the work.
   2.12.4. Other End Item Repair. These end items are sold to the customer at a predetermined EISP. The
   material standards normally include the exchangeable component also. The component repaired on its
   own MISTR identity must be issued as material to the job order applicable to the next higher assem-
   bly. Multiple turn-in and issue documents are required in this case. The technical order for repair of
   the end item may have to be supplemented by use of the subindentured item technical order to com-
   plete the repair process.

2.13. Reorganization Functions. Planning must provide timely support to workloading for all organiza-
tional changes. Due to the need to pass valid production and actual hour data to other systems, it becomes
necessary to closely manage the data systems update preparation relative to organizational change. The
net result is to limit organizational changes to being effective at the beginning of a fiscal quarter.

2.14. Product Quality Deficiency Report (PQDR) Control.
   2.14.1. Reference TO 00-35D-54, USAF Material Deficiency Reporting and Investigation System for
   Category Descriptions. PQDR exhibits will be processed in accordance with TO 0035D-54 and by
44                                                                      AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     locally developed procedures (Base regulations, Etc.) to ensure funding, analysis, report preparation,
     rework (if applicable) and/or return to service is accomplished in a timely manner to support our cus-
     tomers. PQDR analysis and report preparation is funded by the prime ALC. The Job Order Number
     (JON) established for processing these items will have a job designator G assigned (if the repair ALC
     has MISTR workload established, the same JON with job designator G will be utilized). The prime
     ALC is the ALC that manages the asset in question. The repair ALC will not perform PQDR investi-
     gations without being reimbursed in accordance with the no free work policy on the DMAG. Refer-
     ence AFMCI 21-111. The Labor Standard will cover the cause determination (analysis) and the report
     preparation; no repair is authorized on these permanent JON’s with the G designator. If the repair
     ALC does not have an established MISTR workload, an AFMC Form 206 will be issued by the tech-
     nical focal point, e.g., item manager, equipment specialist, quality specialist, etc., and a temporary
     JON established to include the cost of restoring the exhibit to an serviceable condition , if applicable.
        2.14.1.1. Documentation. To provide a proper audit documentation trail, written notification of
        the exhibit numbers, by NSN, must be provided to the processing directorate. This notice may be
        maintained centrally or in the responsible scheduler’s file per local option. DD Form 2332, Prod-
        uct Quality Deficiency Report Exhibit, will accompany each exhibit sent to the repair ALC for
        processing (no exhibit will be accepted for processing by the repair ALC without the DD Form
        2332. A copy of the DD Form 2332 and the communication notice (message or other) is sufficient
        information for audit documentation trail.
        2.14.1.2. Rework of PQDR exhibits. When the analysis of the PDQR exhibit determines the Tech-
        nology Repair Center (TRC), where the work was accomplished, was not at fault, the effort to
        restore the exhibit to a serviceable condition will be accomplished by the TRC as new work and
        will be inducted into the MISTR line. When the analysis of the PQDR exhibit determines that the
        TRC, were the work accomplished, was at fault, the work to restore the exhibit to a serviceable
        condition will be accomplished by that TRC as rework in accordance with Chapter 3. For those
        items undergoing rework for which the analysis has determined that TRC to be at fault, production
        count will not be taken. The material utilized in this particular case will be charged to unload with
        cost code L for those items normally costed under codes A or L. To unload with cost code X for
        those items normally costed under codes D or M and to unload with cost code X for those items
        normally costed under codes E or J (blank job designators in all cases), the direct labor expended
        for this effort will be charged to duty code .26 with special project code 14 in the Resources Con-
        trol Center (RCC) where expended.
        2.14.1.3. Restoration Policy. The restoration of the exhibit item to an ALC reported PQDR’s.
        When a deficient item is discovered by an ALC directorate user from an ALC directorate repair
        line (the discovering directorate becomes the initiator), the item must be processed with proper
        notification to the prime or managing ALC (See TO 0035D-54 for routing and processing control
        procedures). No work will be accomplished on these items without proper prime or managing
        ALC direction. When an ALC directorate initiates a PQDR on material provided or repaired by
        another TRC, the above procedures apply. When the directorate management elects to correct the
        deficiency without the prime or managing ALC direction, the item will be processed and costed as
        rework. In this case, the labor expended will be charged to duty code .26 with special project code
        14 in the responsible RCC and any direct material used will be charged. No earned hour credit to
        a JON or charges to a customer will be made.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                              45


  2.14.2. Policy for costing PQDR MISTR workload. Each quarter an AFMC Form 181, Project
  Order, will be issued by the prime ALC to cover this workload. Each repair ALC performing this
  type of workload must receive the AFMC Form 181 from each prime ALC.
  2.14.3. Restoration Policy. The restoration of the exhibit item to a serviceable condition will be
  accomplished as follows:
     2.14.3.1. If the TRC was not at fault for the deficiency, wash post procedures from the analysis
     job order (G designator) will be used. To the MISTR overhaul job order A job designator will be
     used.
     2.14.3.2. If the TRC was not able to duplicate the reported deficiency and the unit passed all func-
     tional test requirements. The unit will be condition tagged as serviceable and returned to the sup-
     ply system. Wash post procedures form analysis job designator G to MISTR overhaul job
     designator A will not be used.
     2.14.3.3. When the TRC is at fault for the deficiency, charges to the customer is prohibited. The
     restoration to a serviceable condition will be accomplished and direct labor will be charged to duty
     code .26 with the special project code 14 in the RCC where performed. Material will be costed in
     accordance in the RCC where used.
     2.14.3.4. If the work is accomplished at a TRC, which does not have assigned workload responsi-
     bilities charges, will be made on a temporary job order number on the type 6 project order. In this
     case an AFMC Form 206 must be received from the technical focal point prior to the start of the
     restoration process.
  2.14.4. Capacity Utilization (DoD 4151.18-H, Depot Maintenance Production Shop Capacity Mea-
  surement Handbook).
  2.14.5. The following steps outline the procedures for calculating the physical capacity:
     2.14.5.1. Obtain a detailed shop layout print, which identifies the functions of the shop, its bound-
     aries, its area, and its equipment/workbench locations. Verify and update as necessary the layouts
     to reflect the current situation.
         2.14.5.1.1. On the current plant layout print, clearly outline and label each production area
         represented by a one-line entry on the applicable AFMC Form 45. Within the outlined areas,
         draw a line encircling the area of each work station that is used for doing work within the
         existing and programmed workload mix. If some equipment or process is infrequently used or
         supports more than one workstation, it will be included in a workstation as support equipment
         and will not add to the number of work positions for that station. Within each workstation area,
         enter a three-digit code that identifies the function(s) performed at the workstation. First digit
         of the code should be the same as the fifth digit of the Resource Control Center (RCC) code
         and the last two digits are assigned sequentially. (As required.)
         2.14.5.1.2. Facility Code. Developing and maintaining the Resource Control Center (RCC) to
         Facility Code requires identifying every Process Shop Category (PSC) Code and Building
         Number combination in which the RCC performs work. A unique Facility Code is then
         assigned to the combinations as indicated in the sample below. These codes are assigned inde-
         pendently within each RCC. Numbers 1 through 9 are used to identify up to nine Building and
         PSC Code combinations. If additional codes are required, alpha characters A through Z may
         be used.
46                                                                      AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004

            2.14.5.1.3. The RCC/Facility Code master file is maintained in the G029, Depot Maintenance
            Strategic Management System. Changes must be coordinated with the E046B and G004L sys-
            tems prior to implementation.

2.15. Analytical Rework. The assembly, disassembly, test and inspection of prints, modification kits,
end items, assemblies or subassemblies to determine maintenance criteria includes prototype teardown,
analysis, and rework of an item to determine adequacy of job content and material specification on future
workload.

2.16. Job Designator/ Work Performance Category Application.
     2.16.1. The job designator is an alpha code used in the maintenance data systems which has been
     redefined to equate to the work performance category described in DoD 7220.29H, Depot Mainte-
     nance Support Cost Accounting and Production Reporting Handbook. This code is used for the aggre-
     gation of data for all organic workloads for reporting to DoD. The job designator signifies the type and
     extent of repair authorized to be done. Application of the job designators is critical in relation to gen-
     eration of sales billing to DMAG Customers. Organic sales are based upon two categories of produc-
     tion:
        2.16.1.1. The completion of serviceable end items.
        2.16.1.2. The performance of maintenance services, not necessarily resulting in the production of
        serviceable end item.
     2.16.2. The specific job designators are directly related to the foregoing categories. The various inter-
     facing maintenance data systems are programmed to treat production in relation to job designators a
     follows:
        2.16.2.1. Straight job designators. These job designators, A, B, C, D, I, K, M, and N, require pro-
        duction of serviceable end items as the basis for DMAG sales.
            2.16.2.1.1. U is used for software support, W is for CLS use.
        2.16.2.2. Service Job Designators. These Job designators authorize maintenance tasks for which
        the M/D must be reimbursed regardless of the condition of the end item service. Reparable Tech-
        nical Order Compliance (TOC), and condemned as well as serviceable end item returns, will gen-
        erate sales to customers. These job designators are E, F, G, J, L, and T. NOTE: At Aerospace
        Guidance and Metrology Center (AGMC), job designators D, F, G, J, K, L, M, N, and T are con-
        sidered as service job designators.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                            47


       2.16.2.3. Combination job designator. This is job designator H, Modification (alteration or phys-
       ical makeup change, TOC). Depending upon the type of workload, job designator H will be either
       straight or service. The distinction is made as follows:
           2.16.2.3.1. The MISTR items (RGC J, PON 4) covered by job designator H require service-
           able end item completions to generate DMAG sales revenue. The basis is that:
               2.16.2.3.1.1. The MISTR scheduling logic gives first priority to select inventory items in
               TOC status for input to the M/D shops.
               2.16.2.3.1.2. The MISTR system will affect sales only for the return to supply of service-
               able end items.
           2.16.2.3.2. Job designator H is treated as a service accomplishment for non-MISTR work-
           loads. All end item completions, regardless of condition, will generate G072A DMAG sales.
   2.16.3. Authorized job designator codes are found in Chapter 1.
   2.16.4. ATE and Master Layout (MLO) (Numerically Controlled Equipment [NCE]). This type effort
   requires development of programs for application. The cost of this development, if significant and
   performed for a customer (not the M/D), is identified as a service and costed to a temporary JON using
   code R. Cost of this effort, when expended for M/D, is charged as cost class 4 (S-prefix JON with 1
   job designator) in the performing center. Note: When DMAPS Phase II is completed S-prefix will be
   invalid.
   2.16.5. PME is used by many of the maintenance RCCs and outside agencies. Work done on items
   contained in the maintenance PME inventory, if owned by maintenance RCCs, is costed under an
   S-prefix JON with JD 1; if owned by an outside agency, the work is costed to a C-prefix JON with JD
   T.

Section 2B—Planning Procedures,

2.17. Address Tables. To ensure proper distribution of data system products, establish address tables for
maintenance planners and tenant organizations in G004L. Timely update of changes (new or discontinued
units) must be accomplished. The planning organizations will maintain the Planner Address Table (PAT).

2.18. Planning Priorities. The sequence for planning of temporary jobs is portrayed on a computerized
listing (G004L-G5C), Planning Backlog of Temporary Requests. Ranking is based upon the job priority
and the delivery date. For depot generated support requirements worked under temporary job orders, pri-
ority 1A won’t be used if the scheduled completion date of the end item is more than 8 days away. The
priority code is input by the initiator of AFMC Form 206. See Attachment 6.
   2.18.1. Backlog. Backlogs of AFMC Forms 206 may exist for any workloading or planning organiza-
   tions. Workloading backlog/control number assignment /backlog of work requests is listed on the
   G004L-G5B Report. The planning backlog of temporary job requests is shown on the G004L-G5C
   listing. These backlogs occur when workloading or planning technicians accept work requests, and
   other pressing negotiated requirements override the workload or planning effort. Ranking of the back-
   logged requests will be by priority and delivery date.
   2.18.2. Production delay codes must be input by workloaders for any backlogged temporary work
   requests with overdue delivery dates in workloading; by planners for any temporary work requests
48                                                                   AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     backlogged in planning with past delivery dates, and by schedulers for any temporary jobs where the
     JOQ has not been completed by the delivery date. Production delay codes will also be input for per-
     manent JONs except for MISTR, serialized, and engine workloads. They will be input for permanent
     JONs when a scheduled or negotiated completion date hasn’t been met, or as soon as it is known that
     the JON quantity cannot be completed by the scheduled date of completion. The production delay
     codes are necessary to provide feedback to the customer and to the MA internal management units.
     These codes are input with the 930 transaction, and will appear on the applicable G004L system prod-
     ucts. See Attachment 7.

2.19. Workload Control Methods. For each workload requirement, it is necessary to set up a means of
identification for allocation of material, reporting labor used and accounting for sales of production.
These accounts are basically established by Workloading through assignment of control numbers. There
are two types of control numbers, permanent (all numeric) and temporary (an alpha prefix and 4 numer-
ics) assigned (Chapter 1). When a job designator is assigned, the combination of control number and job
designator is called a production number.
     2.19.1. Permanent Production Numbers. Any workload requirement negotiated and or driven by
     EXPRESS, of a continuing duration, ample quantity, and counted in separate increments and pro-
     cesses, will have a permanent production number assigned. Workloads usually included under this
     concept are major end items, exchangeables (PME included), and long flow time end items.
        2.19.1.1. Material standards. Each workload assigned a permanent production number established
        in G004L, for control of the workload must be evaluated for the component material items to be
        used in the repair process. Material standards must be prepared and input to the G005M system.
        These standards are an integral part of the Uniform Cost Accounting System in that these stan-
        dards provide a means to compute an EISP (Reference AFMCMAN 21-5).
        2.19.1.2. Labor standards. Labor standards for workloads assigned a permanent production num-
        ber will be input to E046B (Reference AFMCI 21-105). MDS/PDM labor standards are input to
        G037E/G097.
     2.19.2. Temporary Production Numbers. Temporary production numbers are established for all
     AFMC Form 206 requirements. One-of-a-kind, one-time requirements, workloads of very short dura-
     tion, and manufacture are the types of work authorized for customers under this concept. The AFMC
     206 is established through the Maintenance Workload Management System. The initiator will enter all
     element values from Request Number in the left column to Job Designator in the right column and for-
     ward for Funds Certification. When approved, the AFMC 206 is sent to the Workloading/WTC. The
     system will automatically assign a Control Number. The WTC will forward the AFMC 206 to the
     appropriate Planning organization for additional processing.
        2.19.2.1. An A- prefixed temporary control number is applied to job orders covering technical
        assistance requirements off base (TDY). The costs charged to these job orders will include direct
        labor, direct material, other direct costs, and the applicable overhead. The work must be done out-
        side the base/station on which the depot is located. An exception, which allows use of an A-pre-
        fixed job order for work performed on the base/station, is when that work is performed by
        personnel on TDY from another ALC. Only one A prefixed job order will be established for each
        area technical assistance request. Personnel from supporting M/D RCCs will be loaned to the
        responsible production RCC. All A prefixed job orders must contain a valid Customer Account
        Identity (CAI), MDS, or NSN as the EII.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                            49


         2.19.2.1.1. For normal TDY job orders, the JOQ should be the total number of man-hours
         required for the TDY requirement. The labor operation on the AFMC Form 237 must reflect a
         valid production RCC, operation number 00001, BSPI of S, the operation occurrence of 001
         and cost (ODC) will include travel and per diem costs, and the cost of material requisitioned
         and issued at the area base where the TDY is being performed.
         2.19.2.1.2. For TDY job orders where a special unit job sales price is negotiated or estab-
         lished, the following procedure should be used for establishing the labor standard and other
         direct cost. The M/D receives several work requirements for support to which a unit job sales
         price should be applied. Among these are special projects, functional check flights where the
         M/D provides a pilot to another facility (including contract sites), and other similar applica-
         tions. The job order records can be set up by MAW from processing the AFMC Form 206, ini-
         tiation and processing of the support AFMC Form 237, and forwarding both directly to ACD.
         The unit sales price may be negotiated or established by including the travel, per diem and
         token labor. (Overhead labor is included in our RCC rates). The JOQ on the AFMC Form 206
         must be a minimum of 00001. The AFMC Form 237 must reflect a production RCC, operation
         number 00001, the batch single processing indicator of S and the operation occurrence must be
         001 with the operational standard hours of 1.0. To complete the AFMC Form 237, enter the
         header data, compute the ODC, and input. For example: A negotiated job cost of $900 has
         been accepted. The RCC rate is $30 per hour. Multiply the operation standard hours (OSH)
         (1.0) times $30 (RCC rate) = $30. Job cost $900 less the operation dollars ($30) = $870. This
         value is entered in the ODC block. Labor exceptions won’t be processed for jobs using the job
         cost concept unless personnel are direct labor assigned.
      2.19.2.2. C Prefix. A C-prefixed temporary control number will be used to accumulate production
      costs to a specific customer account code for an area, base/tenant customer for PME only. The
      CAI must be used for all C-prefixed control numbers. To accumulate support man-hours, the
      C-prefixed production number must always be contained in the origin production number field of
      the G004L output tape for G004L processing.
      2.19.2.3. M Prefix. An M-prefixed temporary control number will be used for the overwhelming
      majority of manufacture work. Manufacture in support of suggestion items and tools/equipment
      for use within the M/D will be accomplished as a result of initiation of AFMC Form 206 for that
      manufacture.
      2.19.2.4. S Prefix. An S-prefixed temporary control number with I job designator will be used for
      all cost class 4 work. This will include all repairs and modification performed by the direct shops
      in support of the M/D facilities, ATE programming for the M/D, as well as M/D owned PME
      items.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the S prefix is obsolete.
      2.19.2.5. T-Prefix. This prefix will be assigned to all temporary repair work done on base within
      the M/D shop and all off base modification programs under serial number control.
   2.19.3. JON Suffix Assignment. There are distinct differences between temporary and permanent
   (programmed) JONs.

2.20. Work Authorization Documents.
50                                                                     AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     2.20.1. AFMC 600D transaction is used to establish the G004L master record for all workloads on
     which a permanent production number is used.
        2.20.1.1. This form is computer generated, and one copy may be maintained in the jacket file. End
        items selected for working on a preplanned basis must be of sufficient volume and have a predict-
        able work content to justify the establishment of the required planning data and labor standards.
        There are certain types of workload, which, due to their generation sources or inherent support
        systems, must be worked on a preplanned basis. These include items worked under MDS/Project
        Workload Planning (G037E); MISTR, (G019C); PME (G004L); etc., where use of a permanent
        control number is a system requirement. The above data systems aren‘t used at AGMC; therefore,
        AGMC workloads are generated as a result of negotiated project directives. A production number
        will be effective and valid as long as the item and type of repair is required, regardless of when the
        production number is established in relation to the beginning or end of the fiscal year. There are
        different specified applications of the production number for different types of end items and con-
        trols essential to workload processing. Those like end items worked under a serial number control
        concept, but for a different customer, require only one production number to be opened. A nonse-
        rialized controlled like end item requires a separate production number to be opened for each cus-
        tomer using a different project order. The Program Control Number (PCN) will be different and
        the FCRN may be different. The source for the FCRN and PCN identity is the workloader. This
        match is made through use of the proper PCN code. The following are specific line items requiring
        separate work authorizations for each job designator level of work:
            2.20.1.1.1. Each line item stock number negotiated and accepted for work in the MISTR sys-
            tem.
            2.20.1.1.2. Project directive workloads for which there is a recurring production requirement
            on each MDS of aircraft, aircraft engines, missiles, or inertial guidance system; and Other
            Major End Items (OMEI) identified to a stock number.
            2.20.1.1.3. Base and tenant support requirements (by MDS or NSN).
            2.20.1.1.4. Each line item meeting the programmed criteria in 2.20.1.1.1. above, regardless of
            the type of source of generation.
        2.20.1.2. Processing of AFMC 600D transaction. Processing of AFMC 600D transaction will be
        IAW.
     2.20.2. Temporary Workload Forms. An AFMC 206 is initiated by the customer of the DMAG and
     processed by the workloader. The AFMC 206 will contain the Request Number; Reject Code, Divi-
     sion Code or Delay Code; FCF; Control Number; YD, Data Processing Code; Production Section,
     Scheduling Designator; Planning Organization; Planner Technician Code and Workloader Technician
     Code. The AFMC 206 is sent to the responsible planning organization for processing. From these, the
     planner prepares AFMC 237. Edit errors are rejected to the planner on the G004L-L3B, Daily Plan-
     ner's List. Valid data input processed will be printed out as the official job master record
     (G004L-L3A). Details of the data element entries for AFMC 206 are in Maintenance Workload Man-
     agement System. An AFMC 206 is prepared by workloading to establish follow-on JONs in support
     of blanket requests for services/support.
     2.20.3. A 237/240 transaction is prepared by the planner to support approved 206 transaction cus-
     tomer requirements and for M/D cost class 4 requirements that are not PME. Addenda to planned
     labor or material are authorized on M, T or S prefixed temporary job orders using 240 transaction
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                               51


   when the JON status code is 0. The EISP will be recomputed on M prefix JONs (see (4) Manufacture
   listed below). The EISP may be recomputed on T prefix (nonserialized) JONs until the EISP is greater
   than the customer‘s estimated cost. An example is: JOQ = 5, Inductions = 5 and Completions = 4. If
   the inductions are 5 and the completions are 5, the addendum will process validly; however, the EISP
   won't be updated. The 237/240 transactions labor input is edited based upon current calendar time
   frame to the project order time frame contained in the Request Number Master (RNM) file. If the
   project order time frame in the RNM file is before or equal to the current time frame, the 237/240
   transactions labor input will process. If the project order time frame in the RNM is greater than current
   time frame, the 237/240 transactions labor input will not process. If the project order time frame in the
   RNM is greater than current time frame, the 237/240 transactions labor input will reject and cannot be
   re-input until the current FY /FQ are equal to or greater than that of the PO. An example: The RNM
   has 3244 transactions and the current time frame is 31XXX. The 237/240 transactions input will reject
   until the current time frame becomes 32XXX or greater.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II, S prefix is obsolete.
      2.20.3.1. Planned Material. Planned material is an integral part of the Uniform Cost Accounting
      System. However, for temporary work requirements, the material needed for each job must be
      input to G004L on 237 transactions. For all additions to the original Labor or Material BOM a 240
      transaction is used. This input is used to compute job cost and sales rate/EISP for all temporary
      JONs. The G072A system uses this planned material to allow comparison of actual material
      costed to the JON. All material to be charged as direct material to a JON must have been included
      in the BOM on 237/240 transactions for that JON. An alternate method to compute the material
      cost to a JON is the use of an R Bill of Material Indicator (BOMI) as explained below. A 930
      transaction may be used to change previously input transactions.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II, G072A is obsolete.
      2.20.3.2. Direct Material Rate. A provision is made for using a standard RCC hourly material
      expense rate for computing the EISP on temporary JONs. This is done by use of the R BOMI. If
      the BOMI is input as R, the material cost is computed by multiplying the total standard hours for
      each operation by the direct material rate for the applicable RCC from the RCC rate in the EIA/
      EIB Validation Stack. If the BOMI is input as M, only the cost of the material listed in the BOM
      portion of the 237/240 transaction will be computed into the EISP. Caution must be used in selec-
      tion of the BOMI because this entry cannot be file-maintained.
      2.20.3.3. Planned Labor. Labor requirements for temporary work requests must be determined by
      the planner and documented on 237/240 transactions as labor operations for each RCC involved.
      This labor plan must be input to the G004L system for computation of hourly sales rates/EISP. A
      930 transaction may be used to change previously input transactions.
      2.20.3.4. Manufacture:
          2.20.3.4.1. Local manufacture (M-Prefix) planning procedures have been divided into two
          categories determined by the first position of the PCN. Only reimbursement codes R and U
          apply to these new planning procedures. All other reimbursement codes will retain the existing
          planning procedures.
              2.20.3.4.1.1. A fixed EISP is the basic requirement of the new procedures. To achieve this,
              a complete planning package, both labor and material, must be developed. All material and
              other related data will be available before the job opening.
52                                                            AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     2.20.3.4.1.2. When the planner receives an electronic 206 from the workloader, the plan-
     ner must decide which planning procedures apply. If the first digit in the PCN field is R or
     U the planner will continue with these instructions.
     2.20.3.4.1.3. Initiators of a 206 will ensure that Block 2 contains the customer identity. No
     other organization identity is allowed. The customer identity is used for routing of the
     Temporary Job Request Status Report (G004L-L3C), which contains customer funding
     information.
     2.20.3.4.1.4. The planner will prepare and process a 237 transaction. Since this document
     determines the EISP, it must include total labor and material requirements. The profit or
     loss to DMAG is also determined by the EISP.
        2.20.3.4.1.4.1. The SOPI won’t be marked completed until a C for complete is entered
        into the field and all the direct material is available and the total labor plan is reflected.
        2.20.3.4.1.4.2. The scheduling jacket will be prepared and forwarded to the scheduling
        function. Since the SOPI is incomplete, a JON suffix and the Temporary Job Record
        (G004L-L3A) won't be included with the jacket, but the jacket must include two copies
        of the 237 transaction. A copy of the 237 will be provided to the Shop Support Center
        (SSC) for material requisition. The SSC will order and store the required material at
        the Production Number Level. The planning activity is notified when all required
        material is received. This is a key function as it is the only notification the planner
        receives on the availability of the materials.
        2.20.3.4.1.4.3. The planner should verify the material both for accuracy and price vari-
        ance. A 240/930 may be required to correct any deficiency.
        2.20.3.4.1.4.4. File maintenance, after the JON assignment, must have workloader
        approval, and will create a new EISP. At end of the fiscal year all EISP are frozen and
        file maintenance may be only for record update.
        2.20.3.4.1.4.5. After the Status of Planning Indicator (SOPI) is changed to complete
        (C) by the planner a JON suffix and G004L-L3A is furnished and the jacket moved to
        the normal files. A JON Status Code (JSC) of zero 0 will be assigned automatically and
        work can begin on these items. The JSC S is not applicable for M-prefix JONs with
        reimbursement codes of R or U. The only suspended actions will occur between work-
        loading and the customer.
        2.20.3.4.1.4.6. Addendum after JON assignment, with workloader approval, won't
        change the EISP but may be allowed for record update.
        2.20.3.4.1.4.7. All requests for cancellation or JOQ reduction must be processed
        through workloading. When a JON is canceled, the labor plan will require file mainte-
        nance allowing for actual hours expended.
        2.20.3.4.1.4.8. The JON Master (G004L-G1A) method of recording OWO and AWM
        for reimbursement codes R and U has been modified. Upon receipt of a 206, the com-
        puter will automatically assign the total JOQ to the AWM field. This quantity will
        remain in the AWM field until the 237 transaction is marked complete. At this time, the
        computer will move the AWM quantity to the OWO field.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                                 53


                   2.20.3.4.1.4.9. Planning Jacket File. The jacket file is a suitable envelope used to
                   maintain and accumulate technical and production data on the production number and
                   JON suffix. The jacket file is prepared by the responsible planning function concurrent
                   with input of the 237 transaction. This envelope must be of sufficient size and capacity
                   to contain the anticipated quantity of cumulative data, the production number and EII
                   are shown on the face of the jacket file. A copy of the file is furnished to the scheduler.
                   Each valid transaction processed by the G004L system appears on the G004L-L2A,
                   Visibility and Cross-Reference List. These dailies are retained in the scheduling area.
                   Copies of the 206, 237, and the G004L-L3A list are inserted in the jacket files. For
                   local manufacture jobs awaiting material or tech data, two copies of the 237/240 are
                   inserted in the jacket files.
   2.20.4. When production has been completed and the G004L record closes properly, the completed
   jacket file is sent to the designated records function for filing.
   2.20.5. PME Production Number.
       2.20.5.1. Production numbers established in the JON master for PME workload will always con-
       tain data processing code P. The G004L system will accumulate PME production count received
       from G004L for output to G035A, G004B, and G072A. Roll-up by RCC to the applicable C- or
       S-prefix number is made.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G072A and the S prefix are obsolete.
       2.20.5.2. This PME workload may be accountable to either C- or S-prefix CAIs by G004L
       through use of the customer identity code. The current month coding will be used for the JON suf-
       fix on these C and S numbers.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the S prefix is obsolete.

2.21. Job Order Number (JON) Master. The JON master record, established for each end item or other
type workload requirement, provides the basis for management visibility. As such, it is mandatory that the
planning activity perform its function timely and validly. The source of assets to be repaired, the level of
repair to be accomplished, who will do the repair, methods to be used, the necessary tooling and skill
required, are items that the planner must know to ensure valid master record establishment. Several edits
on input data are accomplished in the computer. The correction of erroneous JON master data must be
made before completion of the last end item, which completes the JOQ. All data in error must be cor-
rected as soon as they are discovered due to the G004B interface for progress billing. The planner must
pay heed to the G004L-L3F, Serial Number List, and G004L-L3B, Daily Planner's List, to correct input
errors.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G004B is obsolete.

2.22. End Item Sales Prices (EISP).
   2.22.1. Permanent Job Order End Item Sales Prices. The G004L system contains an EISP file (Sales
   Price Master SPM) at the control number/job designator level for permanent control numbered end
   items. At the end of each fiscal year and on demand (authorized by AFMC/MAJ), this file is updated
   by the file generated by the G072A system (SO9 values). Only workloader authorized file mainte-
   nance of the EISP file will be accepted by data automation. This input goes into a special G004L
   update procedure (work unit SP). A new price won't be input directly to a JON by a 129 transaction
54                                                                    AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     unless authorized by workloading. When the 129 transaction is processed by G004L, the EISP on the
     H7 transaction will be overlaid by the approved EISP contained on the Sales Price Master (SPM).
     This procedure allows in-process JONs to maintain the EISP at which they were established unless
     individually file-maintained at JON level.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G072A is obsolete.
        2.22.1.1. New Item End Item Sales Prices. When a 600D transaction is initiated for a new inven-
        tory item (new production number is established in the G004L master record), the planner/work-
        loader will enter the estimated sales price and FCRN on the form. The G004L system will then
        enter the production number, FCRN, and estimated price in the SPM. Consideration of the stan-
        dard material and labor rates for each RCC involved must be made to determine this price. (Serial
        number controlled items are exempt). This sales price stays on that item until either HQAFMC
        approves a change for the item or the next annually GO72A-computed EISP is established in the
        SPM. If HQ AFMC approves, a quarterly update of the SPM can be accomplished by using the
        newly computed G072A EISP values to replace the existing values in the G004L SPM. This
        update will result in new JONs acquiring the approved EISP.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G072A is obsolete.
        2.22.1.2. New MISTR Item Procedures. Each year, the workloader will negotiate with the Pro-
        gram Manager (PM)/Item Manager (IM) and production to determine which MISTR requirements
        can be accepted for repair within the maintenance capabilities for the ensuing fiscal year. Quar-
        terly reviews will take place between the workloader and PM/IM and production, for adding,
        deleting, or adjusting current fiscal year quarterly requirements. All requirements accepted by
        maintenance will be established and maintained in the MISTR master file with the associated Unit
        Repair Cost (URC). The URC is electronically input to the G004L system from G072A annually
        and output to G019C by G004L on the next interface cycle. When new JONs are entered into
        G004L through the production transaction, the G004L record establishment procedure will access
        the SPM file to obtain the current price. If the SPM file doesn't contain this production number,
        G004L will establish the new JON record with a zero EISP. File maintenance by workloading per-
        sonnel are required to establish the sales price by use of the computer generated general purpose
        screen and initiation of a 129 transaction with the EISP change at JON level to trigger G004L to
        repeat the accessing of the SPM file to acquire the EISP for the JON record. All new JONs created
        by an induction transaction will pick up the current price from the SPM file. Only workloader
        authorized file maintenance of the SPM file will be accepted by data automation. Many workloads
        are EXPRESS Driven; there are no negotiations.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G072A is obsolete.
            2.22.1.2.1. G004L-S1B. G004L versus G072A EISP Mismatch Report. This report will
            reflect those control number/job designator records contained in G004L for which G072A
            does not have an EISP. The MISTR monitor in workloading will work with workloading bud-
            get analysis, to research these records and work with the specific planner to determine the
            EISP to be input to the SPM.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G072A is obsolete.
            2.22.1.2.2. G004L-S1C. Deleted Control Number (CN)/Job Designator (JD) Records. This
            report will reflect those records in G072A, which have been deleted from G004L. The MISTR
            monitor will coordinate all actions required (if any) to delete the labor and material standards
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                             55


          that created this condition. The MISTR monitor will coordinate with planning and program
          management prior to deleting any CN/JD records.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G072A is obsolete.
      2.22.1.3. Processing and Review of MISTR Unit Repair Cost (URCs). Before the beginning of
      each quarter and as requested by the M/D, MISTR IM Repair Cost Reports are provided to the M/
      D for review of dollars projected by the TRC. Before the beginning of each quarter, MISTR TRC
      Repair Cost Detail by IM and summaries are provided to maintenance. The normal means for
      establishing new URCs for MISTR items is the annual mechanical computation of these costs in
      the G072A systems, which are overlaid into the MISTR master file. New MISTR items generating
      during the fiscal year require the M/D planning function to determine an estimated price for each
      item. That estimate will be entered on a 600D transaction and forwarded to the G004L data sys-
      tem. The estimate is then made available to G019C on the following interface cycle. The recom-
      mended technique for determining the estimated repair price is identified below. (It must be noted
      that once the price is input to the G004L data system on a permanent production number, it won't
      be changed without HQ AFMC approval.)
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G072A is obsolete.
          2.22.1.3.1. Process sufficient quantities on a temporary production (T-prefix) number to deter-
          mine actual cost of repair and adequacy of labor and material standards for later establishment
          on a permanent production number.
          2.22.1.3.2. Establish the labor and material standards in the appropriate data systems (E046B
          and G005M). Using the G004C approved RCC rate (less the direct material portion) and the
          RCC labor standard, determine the dollar value for each RCC through which the end item is
          processed. Determine the direct material costs by NSN. Then summarize the extended labor
          and material values to a single dollar/cents total. This value will be entered on a AFMC Form
          600D and send to G004L for input to the Permanent JON Master (PJM) and SPM files.
   2.22.2. Sales Rates/End Item Sales Prices. All end item production or services saleable to a customer
   must have a means to recover the cost thereof. For this purpose, an hourly sales rate or an EISP is
   used. On temporary JONs that aren't serialized, the G004L system will use the planned labor and the
   BOM to compute the hourly sales rate or the EISP. The G004C system provides a table of the RCC
   approved rates to G004L for this purpose. The MDS rate is used for organic work. The G004L com-
   puted rate or EISP is based on the UOM being input as HR or EA. Depot field team job orders will
   always use A-prefix temporary job order (not serialized). These will be priced at an EISP per standard
   hours with UOM of each. The cost of travel, per diem, and team site material will be added to the total
   job cost and input by a 237 transaction as other direct cost. The labor operation number will be 00001
   in all cases when the A-prefixed JON is used. The C-prefixed JONs are priced at a computer deter-
   mined hourly rate and apply to all non-M/D -owned PME. M-prefixed JONs are priced at an end item
   computer determined price only. S-prefix JONs aren't priced in G004L. They are overhead work and
   therefore not saleable to a customer. G004L will log month-to-date earned hours by RCC. RCC earned
   hours are passed daily to G037G and monthly to G072A. G037G will compute labor summary and
   effectiveness. G035A will compute earned hour costs and distribute them to owning RCCs when iden-
   tified to legitimate RCCS. If earned hours are identified to owning RCC, G035A will compute the
   earned hour costs and move them into General and Administrative (G & A). S-prefix JONs apply to
   all CC4 work including M/D owned PME. T-prefixed JONs, if serialized, are priced at an hourly sales
56                                                                     AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     rate from the serialized master record. All nonserialized T-prefixed JONs are end item priced by
     G004L computation. Rate guidance for use with T-prefixed JONs (serial numbered) is provided in the
     following paragraph 2.22.2.3. In some cases, accomplishment of some workloads by serial number
     control is required to preclude over/under costing to the customer. Refer to AFMCI 21-111, for policy
     on applying special rates for these areas.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G072A, G037G, and the S prefix are obsolete.
        2.22.2.1. Serial Number Work (Temporary). The Application of serial number control is limited
        to T-prefixed temporary production numbers. These temporary production numbers may be
        applied to aircraft, missiles, inertial guidance systems, and OMEI including long flow time items
        on which the work content varies considerably from one item to the next (same NSN, MDS, etc).
        2.22.2.2. Drop-in-maintenance base assigned or chase aircraft, when serial number control is
        used, must have the HQ AFMC approved rate applied by input to the serial number master file.
        When accomplishing crash /battle damaged workload on a serialized basis, with either a perma-
        nent or T-prefixed temporary production number, the HQ AFMC approved hourly rate for that
        specific workload will be applied and entered into the serial number master file (AFMCI 21-111).
        2.22.2.3. Rate Computation. The G004L system will compute the cost of all nonserialized A, M,
        or T-prefixed JONs. A description of the elements and machine formulas is listed below. These
        computations provide an EISP or an hourly sales rate to G004B as required and to G072A at the
        end of the month. When any element affects the cost in a labor operation, or the material associ-
        ated with an operation, or the JOQ is changed, the below computed elements will be recalculated
        for the given JON. When a labor operation is added, or when the associated RCC (an RCC rate) is
        changed, the current RCC rate will be extracted from the G004C funded RCC rate table for use in
        the calculations. All other computations will be performed with the RCC rate that was in effect at
        the time the labor operation was established on the temporary labor standard file. This means that
        the vast majority of labor costs will be calculated at the rates that prevailed when the job was
        opened in G004L. See Attachment 10 for cost code application.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G072A is obsolete.
            2.22.2.3.1. Expense material is also known as funded or nonexchange material. For temporary
            workloads, all expense material will have a cost code of A and it will be applied at 100 percent
            of the stocklist price.
            2.22.2.3.2. Investment material is also known as unfunded or exchange material. For tempo-
            rary workloads, all investment material will have cost codes of D/E/M/T/X/Z. Cost code E
            material will be applied at the average repair cost, while the remaining investment material
            will be applied at 100 percent of the stocklist price.
            2.22.2.3.3. Computation routines:
                2.22.2.3.3.1. Expense Material Cost. To compute the Expense Material Cost (EMC) for an
                operation (for all operations with cost code A), multiply the Stocklist Price (SLP) times the
                Material Quantity (MQ), then summarize the results up to operation number level (there
                can be multiple different items of material for any given operation).
                EMC = SLP x MQ
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                           57


          2.22.2.3.3.2. Investment Material Cost. To compute the Investment Material Cost (IMC)
          for an operation (for all operations with cost code M/D/T/X/Z), multiply the SLP times the
          MQ, then summarize the results up to operation number level. If the Cost code is E, use the
          average repair cost in the same formula. In both cases, the product may contain up to
          six-dollar positions and two cents positions. Transactions exceeding these limits will be
          error coded and output on listing.
          If the cost code is M/D/T/X/Z:
          IMC = SLP x MQ
          If the cost code is E:
          IMC = Average Repair Cost x SLP x MQ (Round to two decimal places)
          2.22.2.3.3.3. Budgeted Labor Cost. To compute the Budgeted Labor Cost (BLC) for an
          operation (the cost of the labor required for completing that operation on all end items in
          the JOQ), multiply the Operation Count Limit (OCL) times the Operation Standard Hours
          (OSH), and multiply the result times the rate (from G004C) for the RCC. The product may
          contain up to six-dollar positions and two cents positions. Transactions exceeding these
          limits will be error coded and output on a listing.
          BLC = OCL x OSH x RCC Rate
          2.22.2.3.3.4. End Item Sale Price (EISP). To compute the EISP (the EISP is needed on
          all WADS with UOM = EA), summarize the Expense Material Cost (total EMC) for
          the job; summarize the BLC for the job; add these two totals to the Other Direct Cost
          (ODC), and divide the result by the JOQ. The product may contain up to six-dollar
          positions and two cents positions. Transactions exceeding these limits will be error
          coded and output on listing. If BOMI = M.
          EISP = (EMC+BLC+ODC)/JOQIf BOMI = R, the BLC must include the RCC direct
          material rate (Basic RCC Rate + Direct Material Rate)EISP = BLC + ODC
          2.22.2.3.3.5. End Item Hourly Rate. To compute the End Item Hourly Rate (EIHR needed
          on all WADS with UOM = HR), add the total expense material cost (EMC), the total labor
          cost (BLC), and the ODC. Divide this sum by the total standard hours (TSH) for the job,
          round the result to whole dollars, rejecting any job with over three significant digits. Also,
          round the results to three decimal positions.
          HSR = (EMC + BLC + ODC)/TSH
          2.22.2.3.3.6. End Item Labor Standard (EILS). To compute the end item labor standard,
          divide the total standard hours for the job by the JOQ, round the result to three decimal
          positions.
          EILS = TSH/JOQ
          2.22.2.3.3.7. Standard Expense Material Cost (SEMC). To compute the standard expense
          material cost for an operation, divide the total EMC for the operation by OCL for opera-
          tion, round the result to three decimal positions.
          SEMC = EMC/OCL
58                                                                      AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


               2.22.2.3.3.8. Standard Investment Material Cost (SIMC). To compute the SIMC for an
               operation, divide the total IMC for the operation by the OCL for the operation, round the
               result to three decimal positions.
               SIMC = IMC/OCL
               2.22.2.3.3.9. Reasons for Recomputation. Whenever any element that affects the cost of a
               job is changed by file maintenance, all of the above computed elements will be recalcu-
               lated for the given JON. When a labor operation is added (through an addendum), or when
               the associate RCC is changed by file maintenance, the current RCC rate will be extracted
               from the validation stack table for use in the calculations. All other computations will be
               performed with the RCC rate that was in effect at the time the labor operation was estab-
               lished on the temporary labor standard file. This means that the vast majority of labor costs
               will be calculated at the rates that prevailed when the job was planned and opened in
               G004L.
            2.22.2.3.4. Temporary JONs are restricted to 1 JON suffix per production number. For nonse-
            rialized JONs, the suffix is assigned normally when the 237 data is processed validly by
            G004L for A, M, and T-prefixed job orders. In this case, G004L assigns the suffix as the cur-
            rent fiscal year, current fiscal quarter, and the last position from the reimbursement code. If the
            current calendar date is equal to or is later than the PON (FY and FQ) on the RNM, G004L
            assigns the suffix as the current FY and FQ. If the data is processed is before the project order
            number (PON) (FY and FQ) in the RNM, the 237 data will be rejected. An exception to the
            above allows G004L to assign a monthly suffix for C- and S-prefix JONs. These S-prefix
            JONs will exist for the purpose of collecting Cost Class 4 earned hours for that month only,
            and a new one is established electronically at the beginning of each month. The nonserialized
            A, M and T-prefixed JONs stay the same until the total JOQ is completed. These JONs are
            closed electronically when the completion value equals the JOQ. Serialized temporary JONs
            are normally T-prefixed and the suffix is assigned through the serialized master record. The
            normal serial numbered JONs remain in work until the end item is completed. The sales indi-
            cator in this case is C. Some end items, due to variance in work content such as base assigned
            aircraft or extremely long flow time, make it more desirable to create sales commensurate with
            the applicable project order period. The JON suffix created by the G004L system is input to
            the serialized JON master record. Each quarter, G004L will electronically create the applicable
            PON. This application will generate quarterly sales and is limited to the type 6 and 7 project
            orders. Recurring work for base tenant support will be accomplished using an S data process-
            ing code and a T prefixed control number. These transactions will be assigned a QSI of M and
            a UOM of HR by the G004L system. The JON suffix will be computer assigned and updated
            each quarter with a new JON suffix and PON.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the S prefix is obsolete.
            2.22.2.3.5. Permanent JONs may have more than one suffix on a given production number at
            one time. The JON suffix (quarterly or monthly) is assigned automatically. When the G004L
            system receives a JON suffix that is new, it will create a new JON record using all the data on
            the previous JON or WAD and the new JON suffix.
     2.22.3. Other Major End Items (OMEI) Pricing. The following method will be used to price the pro-
     grams and specific jobs included in the category Other Major End Item. The current method of
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                                59


   computing sales prices in the G004C system will be continued. The published rate for OMEI, how-
   ever, will identify the labor and burden rate per hour plus the average historical material rate, that is,
   the same rate as currently published but with a breakout of the two elements. This will be used by the
   customer for planning purposes. Actual job pricing will be will be done in two phases.
       2.22.3.1. An Examination and Inspection (E&I) will be authorized and performed at the published
       rate per hour, exclusive of the direct material portion of the rate.
       2.22.3.2. When the E & I has determined the amount of material required for the specific job, a
       repair job hourly rate will be computed. The project total expense material cost will be divided by
       the project Direct Product Standard Hours (DPSH) and the resultant expense material rate per hour
       will be added to the published labor and burden rate per hour. This total rate for the job will be
       entered into the serial number master in the G004L system and the job will be completed and sold
       at this job rate. This method will be used whether the repair is performed on a permanent or tem-
       porary production number.
   2.22.4. Field Team Requirements. Reference Chapter 1 this instruction.

2.23. End Item Identity Configuration (EII). The G004L system edits each EII relative to the RGC,
and Job Designator (JD). These identities relate to type of end item and funds source.
   2.23.1. The end item stock number, MDS, or technical assistance identities (customer account iden-
   tity) description must be entered in the FSC/stock number blocks of each WAD. The accuracy and
   correct application of these entries are essential to the continued integrity of the data system and end
   item production reporting to DoD. The finite structuring of this entry is such that if an erroneous entry
   is made in any of the designated fields, the computer cannot adequately interpret and provide useful
   data.
   2.23.2. The MDS entry must match the established Air Force approved MDS table of standard con-
   figurations. The establishment and maintenance of the MDS master file is the responsibility of HQ
   AFMC. This MDS validation table must include each MDS end item in work in the depot, or to be
   input on future program. System OPR will maintain the table of acceptable MDS identities in the
   G004L system in coordination with HQ AFMC. Locally assigned identities won't be entered in the
   MDS master file or on the WAD. However, if two or more WADs have the same MDS, the noun entry
   (8 alphas or numerics) may be used to identify each separately by customer, etc.
   2.23.3. Each WAD that is prepared for an end item or group of items will reflect entries in the class
   code and stock number block as prescribed.

2.24. Base Tenant Support. All base tenant support should be in accordance with local Host-Tenant
agreements. Where differences occur between the written agreements and DMS, DMAG/Uniform Cost
Accounting (UCA) policy and procedures, however, the DMS, DMAG/UCA policy, and procedures take
precedence. Also, whenever Host-Tenant agreements are initially established or revised, the maintenance
personnel involved will be familiar with the DMS, DMAG, and UCA procedures and will consider these
procedures/policies in their agreement. Recurring work is requested on AFMC Form 206. The DPC is S,
T Prefix C/N is used; BOMI will be R or M; only one labor operation with OSH = 1.00 hour; RGC will
be N; and Unit of Measure (UOM) of HR is computer assigned. In the Job Qty block, the originator will
show the 1st quarter's man-hour requirement; the tenant prepares a AFMC Form 206 for each RCC doing
work for that tenant and sends them to workloading. Workloading will electronically send the 206 to the
60                                                                    AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


Planning Office to prepare the 237 transaction. Temporary production numbers with DPC S aren't closed
automatically, but are updated each succeeding quarter by the computer. Completions are reported by the
G004L system, at the end of each quarter, the computer reduces the JOQ to what has been completed, and
allows the JON to go to sales. The computer then reestablishes the production number with the next quar-
terly PON and JON suffix. If the man-hour requirements change at the beginning of each quarter, the ten-
ant will send a new AFMC Form 206 to workloading depicting the new man-hour requirement in the JOQ
blocks. Workloading will then submit a 930 to file-maintain the new JOQs for each JON established for
that tenant.
     2.24.1. Base tenant support JONs, T-prefix with Data Processing Code (DPC) S, will use Bill of
     Material Indictor (BOMI) of R or M. When BOMI R is used, the EISP is computed using the RCC
     labor rate plus the RCC direct material rate. When the BOMI M is used, the EISP is computed using
     the RCC labor rate only.
     2.24.2. Tenant support jobs. Where it is known that the direct material rate won't cover excessive
     direct material required for the job, it should be put on a separate AFMC Form 206 and AFMC Form
     237 transaction with material planned accordingly. These work requests should use RGC N and DPC
     N. If these type tenant support jobs are recurring, consideration should be made to making them per-
     manent jobs with project order 7, RGC N, and DPC N.
     2.24.3. If a decision is made to make tenant support jobs permanent, then the appropriate IM/PM’s
     should be informed.

2.25. Cost Class 4 Work (CC4). Repair, modification, manufacture, assembly, installation, relocation,
and storage of M/D production or test equipment accomplished by M/D production personnel will be clas-
sified as overhead work. Most problems within this area are related to the determination of what consti-
tutes CC4 work. Accomplishment of M/D equipment repair is CC4 work when done under all of the
following conditions.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the cost class 4 work will be identified as indirect JONs and the
processing will be different.
     2.25.1. At the time the work is done, the equipment and/or all components are property of the M/D
     through prior issue or manufacture action.
     2.25.2. The work was initiated within the M/D rather than by a work order or request (authorization)
     from an outside organization or by an AFMC project directive. Note: Items to be added to Mainte-
     nance Directorate records must be manufactured on the authority of a work request from the request-
     ing organization so that the item [can be turn in for subsequent prescribed issued ]to the M/D as EAID
     (Equipment Authorized in Use Detail) equipment.
     2.25.3. The work does not produce a product, which will add to the Air Force stockage inventory
     (excluding EAID type inventory).

2.26. Serial Number Application. End items processed under serial number control may have either a
temporary (T-prefix) or permanent production number assigned. A, C, or S-prefix numbers aren't autho-
rized. All negotiated end items will have a permanent production number assigned when serial number
controlled. Normal application is for aircraft, missiles, aircraft jet engines, and OMEI. Labor and material
requirements are established accordingly.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the S prefix is obsolete.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                               61


   2.26.1. Serial Number Record File. It is important that the JON master and the serial number data be
   established before any production count is taken to preclude rejection. This file is established elec-
   tronically. The responsible planning activity will establish, maintain, and change serial number data
   on the JON master for the M/D. If a reject occurs, the input transaction will be reflected on the
   G004L-L3B listing with an indication of the invalid entry. Correction will be made electronically with
   the correct data. If erroneous data is depicted on the G004L-L3F listing, the data will be corrected by
   inputting a 930 transaction. The G004L-L3F listing reflects transactions added to this file. This listing
   will be retained until a new one is received. The verification of data elements in this file is necessary
   as the key elements for costing and sales billing are contained on it and extracted for use by G004B,
   G072A, and G004L production count editing
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G072A and the G004B are obsolete.
   2.26.2. Input Data Elements.
   2.26.3. G097 (Programmed Depot Maintenance Scheduling System). The serial number data on the
   JON master must contain an entry for each aircraft worked under G097. The JON suffix must be the
   same as the aircraft identification code in all 3 positions.
   2.26.4. Other Major End Items. These end items must have a separate JON suffix for each serial num-
   bered item.

2.27. File Maintenance. Several files are maintained in the G004L system. A 930 transaction is input for
file maintenance of data contained in the various files. Action codes with specific record identifying data
will be used to overlay the desired data elements.
   2.27.1. Permanent Production Numbers.
       2.27.1.1. Labor standards for permanent production numbers don't reside in G004L, but are con-
       tained in E046B and G037E/G097.
       2.27.1.2. Material standards are contained in G005M. AFMCMAN 21-5 contains the procedures
       for establishment, refinement, and file maintenance.
       2.27.1.3. Serial Number Data. Permanent production numbers must be established in the G004L
       JON master before input of the serial number data. A 930 is input with action code 8 to update the
       serial number data on the JON master file.
           2.27.1.3.1. The control number/job designator must be previously established in the JON mas-
           ter file with a Data Processing Code (DPC) equal to 2 or 9. There can be no duplicate serial
           numbers within a given JON.
           2.27.1.3.2. JON suffixes for G037E items will be all numeric and must correspond to the
           G037E aircraft identity code. Serialized items that are non-G037E involving supply, DPC= 2,
           will have a JON suffix of all numerals. The last position (if DMISA) must be the OPC. For
           serialized Air Force items use 0. Other OPC are: Army-1, Marine-4, Navy-5, Unassigned-O,
           and Air Force and other services-A (AFMCI 21-130). Serialized items that are non-G037E not
           involving supply, DPC = 9, will have a JON suffix of all alphas.
           2.27.1.3.3. The production section/scheduling designator must be on the scheduler's address
           table contained in the G004L-E1A.
62                                                                    AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


            2.27.1.3.4. The PCN must be on the PCN table in the validation stack reflected on
            G004L-E1A.
                2.27.1.3.4.1. The FCRN must be on the FCRN table reflected on the G004L-E1B.
            2.27.1.3.5. The completion date will be created by G004L on the day the end item completion
            is reported to G004L. The serial number record on the JON master will be electronically
            deleted at the end of month after the month in which the completion occurred.
     2.27.2. Temporary Production Numbers. The temporary production numbers reside in four master
     files in the G004L system. File maintenance of any of these files may be necessary. Input electronic
     240/930 is used for file maintenance.
        2.27.2.1. Other Direct Cost. These costs are travel cost, per diem, and material cost when requisi-
        tioned and issued at the area base where the TDY is being performed. For material issued and req-
        uisitioned to that A-prefix job order number at the home station, the material must be entered in
        the BOM segment of the 237. A change in the other direct cost, a change in the number of
        man-hours, a change to labor content or material requirements will cause the G004L system to
        recompute a new hourly sales rate. Any change to labor, travel, or material cost must be entered
        into the G004L system by inputting a 930.
        2.27.2.2. Cancellation of work. There are two types of work cancellation. One type is deletion of
        the JOQ requirement. If this occurs while the job is still in planning, the planner will input a 930
        with a zero entered in the JOQ block. The second type is a reduction of the original requested
        JOQ. In this case, the planner inputs a 930 with control data and the revised quantity to be pro-
        duced. If these cancellations occur during the production process, the scheduler is responsible for
        file maintenance.
        2.27.2.3. Increased Job Order Quantities (JOQ). All JOQ input with a 206 may be increased by
        the initiator only prior to the 237 input. See Chapter 1. Note: All requests for JOQ increases
        should be substantiated with proper documentation and maintained in the jacket file.

2.28. Work Control Documents. The objective is to provide the procedure for portrayal and use of tech-
nical information, quality assurance, work control, work and item identification, item movement, and
routing. This control is applicable to all production organizations processing temporary and programmed
workloads (except for PME and preventive maintenance scheduling control, for aircraft workload control
and for the mechanized temporary workload control document defined in preceding paragraphs). (Refer-
ence AFMCI 21-110)

2.29. Planning Jacket File. Each planning section must develop and maintain a master jacket file for
each permanent production number assigned to workloads within their assigned area of responsibility.
The file requirements of AFMCI 21-105 must also be met. The production number and EII will be shown
on the face of the jacket file. Backup material can be stored in a different location, on a media different
than paper as long as a consistent procedure is followed and an audit trail is maintained. The use of elec-
tronic storage is encouraged with the ability to print documentation on demand.
     2.29.1. Permanent Production Numbers. For aircraft, missile, and OMEI type workloads (PDM), a
     file cabinet may be used to maintain and accumulate the technical and production data. Copies of sup-
     port documents necessary for workload control must be included.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                           63


       2.29.1.1. Aircraft/OMEI (G037E/G097) Workloads. The permanent production number file will
       contain the following:
          2.29.1.1.1. AFMC Form 600D (Optional) screen print
          2.29.1.1.2. Project Directive
          2.29.1.1.3. Other Backup Documents as Required
       2.29.1.2. Other Workloads. The permanent production number file will contain the following:
          2.29.1.2.1. AFMC Form 600D (Optional) screen print.
          2.29.1.2.2. Current Labor Standard*.
          2.29.1.2.3. Project Directive (As Required).
          2.29.1.2.4. DD Form 1723, Flow Process Chart, or a Flow Process Diagram.
          2.29.1.2.5. Flow Day Computation (Required by AFMCI 21-105).
          2.29.1.2.6. Other Backup Documents as Required.
NOTE: If the labor standard development function is separate from the normal planning function
and separate folders must be maintained, then a copy of the labor standard is desirable in the plan-
ning jacket folder, but not mandatory.
   2.29.2. Temporary Production Numbers. A separate or a centralized file may be used. The file will
   contain the following:
       2.29.2.1. AFMC 206 screen print.
       2.29.2.2. AFMC Form 237 screen print.
       2.29.2.3. AFMC Form 240 screen print (As required)
       2.29.2.4. Other backup documents as required.

2.30. Material Standard Data Products. Identification and description of these data system products
with actions required from planning are contained in AFMCMAN 21-5 and AFMCI 21-130.

                                    OPERATIONAL SCHEDULING

Section 3A— Scheduling And Control

3.1. General. Scheduling within each Maintenance Directorate (M/D) provides control of in-process
workloads to allow timely completion of jobs. This function entails requisitioning/turn-in of production
assets. Shops report earned labor hours and end item completions to determine costs in the work-in-pro-
cess accounts, and Job Order Number (JON) completions for the sales of that production to DMAG cus-
tomers. Scheduling prerequisites include technical knowledge of data systems, ability to allocate
manpower, knowledge of production processes, and the ability to interpret directives. The goal is to pro-
vide meaningful feedback data to other levels of management for decision-making purposes. The G004L,
Job Order Production Master System, provides the basis for job order costing by end item identity. The
system accounts for end items input to work, accumulates hours earned during the repair process, outputs
these hours to other data systems for computation of effectiveness, creates work-in-process records and
accumulates production units completed for output to G072A at the job order level which results in reve-
nue to offset costs incurred. The system provides many data products for use at different levels of man-
agement. These products track production and show earned hours. AMARC uses a commercial
off-the-shelf system that provides similar services. AFMCI 21-133, Depot Maintenance Management for
Aircraft Repair, discusses Aircraft Logistics Specialist (ALS) and AFMCI 21-129 refers to the workload
manager, in this chapter we will refer to an ALS and Workload Manager as a scheduler.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II G072 is obsolete.

3.2. Relationship with Other Functions. The scheduling function depends upon support from the item
management, production management, and depot supply areas as well as the coordination between the
workload control organization, the planning units, the production shops, and applicable control centers.
     3.2.1. Workload Control. In the commodities/Missiles/Other Major End Items (OMEI), area the
     scheduler depends upon the production management team (Item Manager, Production Management,
     and Equipment Specialist) to provide identification of workload requirements (thru EXPRESS as
     applicable). The production management team serves as liaison between the customer and the sched-
     uler for matters concerning workload requirements and status of production.
     3.2.2. Planning. Scheduling depends upon the planners to provide the required work documents, labor
     and material identification, and standards. Planners also identify/provide special tooling, etc, which
     enable the shop to repair end items or components. The scheduler relies upon the planners to update
     the labor and material requirements when unpredictable work operations arise.
     3.2.3. Production. The scheduler depends upon the production supervisor and the shop workers to
     identify unplanned parts requirements and labor operations. The scheduler also relies upon production
     personnel for notification of labor operations and end items completed.

3.3. Planning Team Concept. The scheduler of a shop organization is a designated member of the plan-
ning team. The scheduler helps with the determination of flow time, manpower allocation, shoploading,
and placement of production material support function personnel to expedite the processing of compo-
nents removed for repair by the support shops, assets into shops, control of holding area functions, and
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                              65


establishment of return points for items which are to be reinstalled. The scheduler also provides the
required support for the prototyping necessary to set up the production line.

3.4. Cost Awareness. Each scheduler must maintain proper accounting and reporting procedures. Fulfill-
ment of the responsibility of proper production count and production completion reporting will promote
cost awareness. All material consumed on a JON must be charged to that JON. Variances within JONs
will be discernible when erroneous charges are made. If manual production count procedures are used, the
comparison of planned verses actual cost will be apparent to the analyst if the JON is completed and the
production count wasn’t submitted on time. The schedulers must ensure that reporting clerks, production
support unit, and other personnel in their area of control are knowledgeable of proper identification of
items inducted, items completed, component items forwarded to support shops, materials issued, and
labor used.
NOTE: Under DMAPS, production count by the scheduler is obsolete.

3.5. Shop Workload. Shop workload generates from many sources.
   3.5.1. Project Directive. This workload consists of maintenance support of items such as aircraft, mis-
   siles, engines, and Other Major End Items (OMEI). The majority of this work is predictable and there-
   fore it can be negotiated. Planning for material and shop work loading can be determined from
   negotiations.
   3.5.2. Management of Items Subject to Repair (MISTR), (contract and organic). Exchangeable items,
   which the schedulers must produce on time. This workload is contained in the G019C system as nego-
   tiated workload. The organic workload is managed in D087X, Execution and Prioritization of Repair
   Support System (EXPRESS), (Ref AFMCI 21-130). The fixer is the single person accountable and
   responsible for assets in the production shop and the assigned resources to accomplish Depot repairs.
   Using the standard DREP process, the fixer is responsible for production output for their shops. Ref-
   erence AFMCI 21-129.
       3.5.2.1. Line Support. This type workload in most cases is identifiable as an end item for which
       some shops in the maintenance complex has an established production process. Normally, these
       items are removed from major end items such as aircraft, missiles, or engines. Job routed repair is
       not authorized if serviceable assets are available unless a waiver is requested and approved. When
       this condition exists, assets will be removed, turned in to supply and serviceable assets withdrawn
       from supply, and installed. The end item material standard will reflect a remove and replace con-
       cept. When it becomes apparent serviceable assets cannot be made available for timely support,
       job routing will be accomplished and the appropriate documented justification will be maintained
       in the planners jacket file.
       3.5.2.2. Over and Above (O&A), Line Support. This type workload in most cases is identifiable
       as an end item for which some shops in the maintenance complex has an established production
       process. Normally, these items are removed from major end items such as aircraft, missiles, or
       engines.
       3.5.2.3. Other Workload items in this category include all non-programmed workloads, that is,
       area, base, contract, tenant support, software support, cost class 4, Depot Maintenance Interservice
       Agreement (DMISA), and local manufacture. These categories by their inherent nature create a
       workload mix with different priorities. This requires actions by each scheduler involved to ensure
66                                                                     AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


        timely production without disrupting the production line. Proper processing of these workloads
        along with line production provides full line work loading of the shops. The fixer is responsible
        for determining, forecasting, obtaining, assigning, and managing resources required to perform
        programmed and non-programmed workloads. (Reference AFMCI 21-129 and AFMCI 21-133)

3.6. Workload Control. The schedulers are responsible for all production items within their area. Sev-
eral forms are used to maintain status of these items:
     3.6.1. AFMC Form 105, Workload Record. This form is initiated by the scheduler to document the
     necessary information concerning schedule and production status of each end item processed through
     repair. This includes all items issued from or turned-in to depot supply by 244 transactions, and sup-
     port shop productions are also recorded on these forms. PME items scheduled and processed are
     exempt from being recorded on AFMC Form 105. This form provides an auditable progressive inven-
     tory record of end items processed through the repair shops. Forms may be filed in job order number,
     master National Stock Number (NSN), or actual NSN sequence at the option of each scheduling activ-
     ity. The forms may then be filed for future reference.
     3.6.2. AFMC Form 105. The function of this form is the same as AFMC Form 130 and is used by the
     engine ALCs for those JONs, which involve both 244 transaction.
     3.6.3. Product Quality Deficiency Report Exhibit Processing. Refer to TO 00-35D-54, USAF Defi-
     ciency Reporting and Investigation System. If the processing ALC has a MISTR workload estab-
     lished, the same control number may be used with a G job designator assigned. This designator will
     include the cost of the cause determination (analysis) and report preparation. If the processing ALC
     doesn’t have an established MISTR workload, a Temporary job order number (AFMC Form 206) with
     a job designator G assigned, will include the cost of the cause determination (analysis) and report
     preparation. AFMC Form 206 must be issued by the Inventory Material Manager (IMM)/ES. No
     repair is authorized on G Job Designator.
     3.6.4. To provide the proper audit documentation, a written notification of exhibit numbers with NSN
     must be provided to the M/D. This notice may be maintained centrally by the M/D quality assurance
     unit or in the responsible schedulers’ files as per local option. DD Form 2332, Product Quality Defi-
     ciency Report Exhibit, will accompany each exhibit sent to the M/D for processing. A copy of this tag
     and communication notice (message or other) will suffice for the audit documentation. No exhibit will
     be accepted by the M/D without the DD Form 2332.
     3.6.5. Any material deficiency detected by the M/D quality organization during the repair process
     should be reported according to TO 00-35D-54.
     3.6.6. When analysis of the PQDR exhibit determines that the Technology Repair Center (TRC) was
     not at fault, the work will be done by that center if a funded requirement exists. The item will be wash
     posted to the MISTR repair control number.
        3.6.6.1. When analysis of the Product Quality Deficiency Report (PQDR) exhibit determines that
        the TRC was at fault (workmanship), the item is designated rework and accomplished using the G
        job designator. . For those operations undergoing rework, production count won't be taken. The
        item will be turned into supply as a repairable asset.
     3.6.7. Awaiting Parts (AWP). This is a holding account for non-serialized/serialized items awaiting
     parts. It is essential that this account be used to de-obligate customer funds for assets that were OWO
     and work has been stopped due to lack of parts. The de-obligation of funds releases that fund value to
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                              67


   allow the induction for other assets that are supportable. The vehicle to evaluate resource supportabil-
   ity is the Supportability Module in EXPRESS. After passing the supportability module, repair require-
   ments are entered on to the D035K, Stock Control and Distribution EXPRESS, table and sent to
   J025A for funds applications. (Reference AFMCI 21-129 for detailed instructions for placing DREP
   assets in AWP status).
   3.6.8. Rob-back. This is defined as the removal of an assembly, subassembly, or component from an
   end item inducted for maintenance and placed on another end item. Shops may rob-back from AWP as
   an alternate source of parts. If rob-backs are accomplished, the shop mechanic is responsible for pro-
   viding Shop Service Center (SSC) with the end item document numbers of the part/component
   involved. The SSC will file maintain the backorder to the designated end item. (See AFMCI 21-129,
   AFMCI 21-130; and AFMCI 21-133 for instructions pertaining to the scheduler/PMT).
   3.6.9. The AFMC Form 959/ITS/173, DO12, Work Control Document (WCD). These documents are
   the only HQ AFMC approved WCD’s. This document will be printed for each item inducted or as a
   result of planning team action. A separate document may be required for different levels of repair on
   a specific stock number. When this form is used as a movement document, it must contain specific
   information stating that it is for move purposes only. This form may also be used for identification and
   documentation of items awaiting reinstallation. This document may be used for verification of pro-
   duction (Reference AFMCI 21-110).
   3.6.10. Routed Order. This document (ITS/AFMC Form 127) is normally preprinted as per planning
   team action, and used for the identification of items being moved or components sent to support shops
   for repair.
   3.6.11. Temporary Job Record. G004L-L3A, this document is produced from the AFMC Forms, 206,
   237, and some G004L transactions. These records will become the official job record. Use AFMC
   Form 959/ITS/173, Work Control Document, will be used for each work order(s).
   3.6.12. PDMSS (G097). Several products are provided for control of end items processed under this
   system.
   3.6.13. Production Item Control. The scheduler must ensure that proper documentation of production
   item issues and turn-ins is maintained. Research of this documentation is sometimes necessary to rec-
   oncile the AFMC Form 105/130 and quantities shown in the JON Master Record. AF Form 115a,
   Register of Control Numbers, or computer generated transaction history is used in the scheduling
   units to effect the required documentation. Quantities by stock number and document number are
   recorded for both issues and turn-in transactions. The G004L-L2A listing provides visibility of all
   transactions processed each day. The G004L system provides W-series products to show those stock
   number Ownership Purpose Code (OPC) relationships, which require research for reconciliation. The
   D035K system provides a transaction register, which can be used along with AF Form 115a or suitable
   general-purpose worksheet/screen, which serves as a ledger of Daily Transaction Register (DTR) and
   AFMC 105/130 reconciliation.
   3.6.14. Awaiting Maintenance (AWM). Is a delay status for items that are pre-positioned in the main-
   tenance complex awaiting maintenance.

3.7. Responsibilities. The scheduler is responsible for accomplishing the proper assessment and balanc-
ing of factors including production manpower skills, available equipment, and the induction of workloads
68                                                                    AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


into production shops. Equally important, the scheduler is responsible for ensuring that only authorized;
funded EXPRESS driven or negotiated workload is produced.
     3.7.1. In-Process Visibility. The scheduler is responsible for the accountability of end item assets in
     the proper accounts, such as Awaiting Maintenance (AWM), AWP, OWO, and DIOH. Reporting of
     completions will be made against the JON on which inducted. Schedulers must use the various sys-
     tems products to maintain visibility of those items within the shops for which they have direct work-
     load responsibility. These products, used along with end item production and earned hour reports,
     enable the scheduler to better control the production process.
     3.7.2. Material and Production Items. The scheduler is directly responsible to provide parts requisi-
     tioning data on time to the Shop Support Center (SSC). This data, obtained from the planner, are stock
     number/part number of components required to repair end items. Customer requirements, coupled
     with the shops capability, dictate the scheduling time frame for production items. The scheduler pro-
     vides the surveillance, feedback, and notification of problems for resolution or making higher-level
     management decisions (AFMCR 65-12, AFMCMAN 21-5, AFMCI 21-129, and AFMCI 21-130).
     3.7.3. Floating Stock. SSC must know what items are provided as floating stock and condition of the
     stock; and ensure timely repair of the items for which the stock is used, Reference AFMCI 21-130.
     This may require coordination with planning team members, other schedulers, or SSC personnel, Ref-
     erence AFMCI 21-129.
     3.7.4. Production Count (G004L-L2C). Schedulers are responsible for ensuring only authorized,
     completed, and acceptable production count is reported. Procedures for taking production count are
     included in Section 3B of this instruction.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II, no production count will reside in G004L.

3.8. Local Manufacture. All local manufacture requires that AFMC Forms 206 and 237 be processed
validly by the G004L system before work can begin. The AFMC Form 206 gives the basic authority for
manufacture. These requests, regardless of source of requirement (M/D, LGS or tenants) must be pro-
cessed through LGS. This type work is funded on type 6 or 7 project orders. The AFMC Form 237 or
AFMC Form 240 provides the labor and material data required for costing. Work requests will be pro-
cessed on a temporary JON using M control number prefix and K job designator. The Unit of Measure
(UOM) is normally EA. The computer will create an End Item Sales Price (EISP) for each unit of the JON
quantity. Local manufacture for line support of one time requirement (Non-recurring) on serialized work-
loads, when included in the work package negotiated with the M/D or approved by the Project Adminis-
tration Officer (PAO) for over-and–above accomplishment, doesn’t require the processing of AFMC
Form 206. This line support may be accomplished as a labor operation on the JON applicable to the end
item and worked under the G097 system. A computer generated AFMC Form 127/173 may be used by the
supporting shop for processing the manufacturing requirement. The analysis of unpredictable operations
will also be used to determine recurrence and when applicable, will be used as the basis for preparation of
AF Form 86, Request for Cataloging Data/Action (Reference AFMCI 21-130 and AFMCI 21-110).

3.9. Special Job Processing. High priority type items may be input to work before processing the 206 or
237. Required paper work should be processed as soon as possible.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II special job processing will change.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                            69


3.10. Data System Interfaces. Scheduling is responsible for providing input to several data management
systems. Examples of these systems are as follows:
   3.10.1. D035K. AFMC Stock Control and Distribution/Central Material Locator System. Issues and
   turn-ins of production items and material from supply sources will be accomplished by input of the
   244 transaction to D035K. Production item transactions are passed electronically from D035K to
   G004L.
   3.10.2. G019C, MISTR-Organic. This system produces the MISTR consolidated schedule and is used
   to identify end item quantities for the quarterly MISTR drive (Refer to AFMCM 65-296, Management
   of Items Subject to Repair (MISTR) G019C Users Manual).
   3.10.3. E046B, Labor Standard Mechanization System. Reporting of labor operations is accom-
   plished using one of the following methods:
       3.10.3.1. Manual Count (PCI=M). Completion of labor operations is reported by input of 600A
       transaction automatically thru remote production count devices or directly into the E046B system.
       The E046B system automatically passes the production count transaction to the G004L system,
       and is viewed on the L2C report.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II there is no 600A production manual count.
       3.10.3.2. Automatic Count (PCI=A). Labor operations are recorded automatically when end item
       completions are reported to the G004L system, and are viewed on the L2C report.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II Production count is not shown on the L2C.
       3.10.3.3. G037E, Scheduling and Control of Mission, Designation, Series (MDS)/Projects Work-
       loads. Reporting of labor operations completed on each JON is input by AFMC Form 127. The
       G037E system in turn passes the production count transaction to the G004L system.

3.11. Data Reliability. Scheduling depends upon the planning function to provide a valid means of
reporting standard labor used and valid identification of material requirements to enable reporting for
costing accurately. Revenue received from sales should equate to the cost of actual resources consumed
on each JON. Daily management reports are available to the schedulers to maintain data integrity. Errone-
ous transactions processed must be corrected upon receipt of the error listings.

3.12. Types of Production Count. There are two basic types of production count: automatic count
where the earned hours are generated as a result of end item completion reporting to G004L; and manual
count that is input under control of scheduling as the labor operations are completed.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II there is no 600A production manual count
   3.12.1. Application of Automatic Count, this count is limited to selected nonserialized permanent,
   temporary, and support JONs.
   3.12.2. Application of Manual Count, manual count is used for all serialized JONs and for selected
   permanent, temporary, and support JONs.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II there is no 600A production manual count.

3.13. Job Order Cancellation/Reduction. The customer may determine that the quantity requested is
more than needed or that total requirement must be cancelled. The change of the Job Order Quantity
70                                                                     AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


(JOQ) to the new value is accomplished electronically using a 930 (H2) transaction. When the JOQ is
reduced to zero, the G004L system will assign job status code 3. If material has been received and won’t
be used, this material should be returned to supply before cancellation. Refer to AFMCMAN 21-5,
AFMCI 21-129, and AFMCI 21-130. Review all backorders for cancellations.

3.14. Suspended Temporary Jobs for Customer Job Order Release. After the AFMC Form 237 is
processed into G004L for a temporary job with the Status of Planning Indicator (SOPI) marked complete,
if the resulting planned cost (EISP X JOQ) exceeds the estimated job total costs (entered by initiator of the
AFMC Form 206), the job will go into suspense status with an S JON Status Code. While the job is in sus-
pense, production asset and material transactions will reject from the D035K system. The workloader
must contact the initiator to accept cost over and above that originally planned. The workloader submits a
customer job order release to accept as is with planned costs moved to the estimated cost field, to increase
dollars allocated or decrease the job. The following jobs are exceptions and will not go into suspense
when planned costs exceed estimated costs:
     3.14.1. C – Prefix JONs.
     3.14.2. M – Prefix JONs with R and W reimbursement code.
     3.14.3. S – Prefix JONs.
     3.14.4. T – Prefix JONs S data processing code.
     3.14.5. T – Prefix JONs serialized (except those with DPC=7).
     3.14.6. Priority 1A transactions.
     3.14.7. A – Prefix JONs.

Section 3B—SCHEDULING PROCEDURES

3.15. Data Processing Codes. All 206 and 600D transactions will contain the applicable Data Process-
ing Code (DPC) as per the usage assignment. The scheduler will use these codes as the basis for determin-
ing how and what to report to the G004L system. The DPC can be file maintained by 930 transaction as
shown in Work Authorization Document (WAD) edit extension. See Attachment 4 for data processing
codes.

3.16. JON Suffix Establishment. The method of establishing inductions depends upon the DPC
assigned to the production number and the type of work.
     3.16.1. Permanent Serialized. The suffix is established upon the input of Serialized Record Establish-
     ment.
     3.16.2. Permanent Nonserialized. The suffix is established upon input of the 244 transaction for each
     JON period (monthly or quarterly).
     3.16.3. Temporary Serialized. The suffix is established upon input of serialized Record Establish-
     ment.
     3.16.4. Temporary Nonserialized. The suffix is established upon input of 237 with SOPI = C. C and
     S- prefix, production numbers automatically regenerate with a new suffix monthly. T-prefix produc-
     tion numbers with DPC = S regenerated with new JON suffixes quarterly.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                                 71


   3.16.5. If a monthly JON suffix has been established in a fiscal quarter, a quarterly JON suffix cannot
   be established in the same fiscal quarter. If a quarterly JON suffix has been established in a fiscal quar-
   ter, a monthly JON suffix can not be established in the same fiscal quarter. If the EISP is greater than
   or equal to $15,000 a monthly JON suffix must be used. If the EISP is less than $15,000 a monthly or
   quarterly suffix may be used. Any transaction that fail these edits will be rejected with * over the JON.

3.17. Annual Customer Order Quantities (ACOQ) and Job Order Quantities (JOQ). This quantity
reflects the customers negotiated requirements for funding. The G004L System reflects a JOQ on all tem-
porary production numbers. For permanent production numbers the system reflects ACOQ during the
fourth quarter only. This quantity represents the outstanding customer requirement, which should be
inducted and completed against fourth quarter requirements. Further, during the fourth quarter, the
RACOQ is reflected on several G004L products. This figure represents either the quantity remaining to be
inducted or the number of assets inducted in excess to the funded COQ. If over-inducted, the RACOQ
will reflect a negative (-) condition. Uniform Cost Accounting and G004L system procedures cause repair
funds to be set aside against inducted work ordered by the customer. The customers repair funds are
known as DPEM (Depot Purchased Equipment Maintenance) funds. These funds are projected and pro-
grammed by the AFMC requirements. The customer’s funds are considered 1-year funds in that these
funds must be used to order work in the fiscal year in which provided. Systems that provide a combination
of data to determine the amount of customer funds used are G004B (aircraft and OMEI), G019C
(exchangeables) and G004L (other) for COQ and G004L/G004B for inductions during the first three
quarters of the fiscal year. To make sure customers funds can be used to order work for Management of
Items Subject to Repair (MISTR) exchangeables before fiscal year end, the G004L system provides data
from G019C reflecting fourth quarter input negotiations as an ACOQ. To determine customer funds used,
G004L fourth quarter inductions are compared to the ACOQ. Because the customers funds are considered
1-year funds, fourth quarter inductions against the ACOQ turned in unserviceable after 30 September and
not inducted on an M suffix JON before 31 December will result in unused prior fiscal year customer
funds. Unused prior fiscal year customer funds are called fallout funds. Because inductions on OWO are
the measure of customer funds used, the ability to control appropriate inductions to OWO is of primary
importance within the Uniform Cost Accounting process. The fiscal year funds closeout process can be
minimized by assuring MISTR exchangeables on OWO are reconciled before the end of each quarter to
assets reasonably expected to become serviceable turn-ins at some future time. The RACOQ is electroni-
cally computed by subtracting inductions from ACOQ. During the period, 1 September – 31 December,
the G004L System produces a L2B product, RACOQ Listing which is in PS/SD sequence. This product is
designated for the scheduler to use in monitoring RACOQs. It reflects only the production numbers for
which the scheduler is responsible and which have a RACOQ value other than 0. The scheduler must
ensure that all inductions have been made by 30 September to satisfy the customer’s requirement. At the
close of business 30 September the G004L System will stabilize the ACOQ inductions and set RACOQ
values to 0 unless they are negative. If negative, the scheduler should immediately take one of the follow-
ing actions:
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G004B system will be obsolete.
   3.17.1. Move to AWM.
   3.17.2. Return to Supply.
   3.17.3. Move to satisfy first quarter JON requirements, if one exists.
72                                                                  AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     3.17.4. From 1 October-30 December the L2B will only reflect RACOQs on production numbers
     which have had nonserviceable turn-in (condition code F, J, K, L, P, G, or H, also E condition code
     on MISTR workload (RGC=J) with an H job designator) since end of fiscal year and production
     numbers where over-inductions have occurred. An M suffix JON will only be allowed in October,
     November, and December for a production number with an RACOQ value equal to or greater than the
     transaction quantity.

3.18. Schedulers Jacket Files. The scheduler will maintain a jacket file on each temporary production
number for which the scheduler is responsible. Contents of the jacket will include as a minimum.
     3.18.1. AFMC Form 206 screen print.
        3.18.1.1. AFMC Form 237 screen print and AFMC Form 240 (when applicable) (2 copies).
        3.18.1.2. Other backup documents as deemed necessary.
     3.18.2. Disposition of the jacket file will be:
        3.18.2.1. Temporary-when completion equals JOQ on the G004L-L2A report, and the scheduler
        verifies all production count has been taken, the jacket file may be forwarded to the responsible
        planner for disposition as required. The exceptions on temporary workload are:
        3.18.2.2. C-Numbers.
        3.18.2.3. T-Numbers when DPC=S.
        3.18.2.4. S-Numbers on cost class 4

3.19. Inductions. These types of inductions and method used to establish them depend on the DPC
assigned to the production number and the type of work involved. See Attachment 4 Data Processing
Codes.
     3.19.1. T-Data Processing Code and all permanent production numbers have the induction value
     established from a 244 transaction.
     3.19.2. Temporary Production Numbers:
        3.19.2.1. N-Data Processing Code—JON inductions and OWO balances are electronically estab-
        lished equal to JOQ when 206 is processed to establish the production number.
        3.19.2.2. M-prefix with R and W reimbursement codes (first position of PCN) will establish
        inductions and OWO balances equal to JOQ when 237 is processed reflecting SOPI as C (com-
        plete).
        3.19.2.3. All other M-prefix production numbers establish JON inductions and OWO balances
        equal to JOQ when the 206 is processed to establish the production number.
        3.19.2.4. C and S prefix numbers with DPC=P reflects inductions equal to completions as
        received.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II S prefix is obsolete.
        3.19.2.5. S-prefix numbers with DPC=N immediately reflect JON inductions when the 206 trans-
        action is processed to establish the production number.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II, S prefix will be obsolete.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                              73


      3.19.2.6. T-Data Processing Code and all other temporary production numbers have the induction
      value established from 244 transaction transactions.
   3.19.3. All other temporary production numbers have the induction value established from 244 trans-
   action.

3.20. Induction Transaction Processing.
   3.20.1. 244 transaction Inductions. The 244 transaction is used for all source production items
   inducted from supply (D035K); Nuclear Ordnance Commodity Management (NOCM) and for
   engines that are directly inducted into G004L. Supply production items require input of Receipt
   Acknowledgement (RA transactions) through to the D035K system. The G004L is electronically
   updated daily by tape from the D035K system. For engines and NOCM items, the 244 transaction
   must be input directly to G004L through Data Automation (AFMCI 21-130).
   3.20.2. The D035K edits the 244 transaction for valid stock number, document number, production
   number, and quantity in transit to maintenance. If the JON suffix is missing or any of the above is in
   error, the input will reject with the appropriate error code. (See Attachment 11 for status advice
   rejects codes). G004L edits the transaction for compatibility of pertinent data in the master files. Any
   reject will be error coded to identify the reason for reject. The error code will print out on the
   G004L-L2A report. When the reject appears on the G004L daily, D035K has been updated. To pre-
   vent a DIOH/IN MA out-of-balance condition, correct the G004L data only, and leave the D035K data
   unchanged.
   3.20.3. 971 transaction – Temporary Production number with DPC: N System inductions, all items
   generating from sources other than supply not having inductions posted automatically by the G004L
   system are reported by the System as each item or group of items is inducted. Valid and invalid induc-
   tions are reflected on the L2A Report.
   3.20.4. File Maintenance of Inductions. Based on the DPC contained in the JON master record, a 244
   transaction/971 transaction is initiated. A 930 is used to correct erroneous JOQs must be processed
   with workloader approval.
   3.20.5. Verification of Production Transaction, visibility of the end-item induction/completions trans-
   actions is reflected on the Daily Visibility and Cross Referenced list (G004L-L2A).
   3.20.6. Misidentified Production Item Inductions. When a production item is received from base sup-
   ply and is truly misidentified, the following options/actions are available to the scheduler: Option 1
   turn in misidentified; Option 2 if a funded requirement exists and is repaired in your shop, wash post
   to the correct control number.

3.21. Awaiting Maintenance (AWM).
   3.21.1. Purpose. This balance can be used for two purposes:
      3.21.1.1. Account for assets prepositioned into maintenance without obligation of customer
      funds, and retain visibility of assets accounted for under DIOH in the D035K system. Not to be
      used for EXPRESS driven items.
      3.21.1.2. To allow de-obligation of customer funds when assets are OWO and work is discontin-
      ued for a period of time for whatever reason except awaiting parts. This action will enable sched-
74                                                                   AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


        ulers to use the de-obligated funds for induction of other assets that the Item Manager/Production
        Manager (IM/PM) has a requirement for.
     3.21.2. Restrictions:
        3.21.2.1. Assets can be inducted from supply directly to the AWM balance, but cannot be returned
        directly from AWM to supply. Before returning the assets to supply, they must be transferred from
        AWM to OWO, using current JON suffix, then the D6 turn-in transaction processed to return the
        assets to supply.
            3.21.2.1.1. Refer to the ITS procedures in AFMCMAN 66-419, System Maintenance using
            EXPRESS.
        3.21.2.2. Work is not to be performed on assets and earned hours (production count) are not to be
        reported against assets while in AWM status.
        3.21.2.3. The use of AWM is not applicable to serialized workloads and if attempted, will appear
        on the G004L-L2A with asterisks over the JON.
     3.21.3. Procedures:
        3.21.3.1. Supply to AWM (Prepositioning). The use of the receipt transaction (D7/RB) transac-
        tion with a JON suffix will cause the D035K system to plus the DIOH value, decrease the IB1
        (MW) value, and pass the transaction to G004L. The D7/RB transaction will cause G004L to plus
        the AWM field. This transaction won’t affect the OWO, inductions, or remaining annual COQ.
        3.21.3.2. AWM to OWO. A D7/RC transaction with the current JON suffix and action suffix PK
        will be input to D035K and passed to G004L. The G004L system logic will minus the AWM
        value, plus the OWO and JON inductions value and decrease the remaining ACOQ by the quantity
        indicated. The D035K system won’t change any values in its record.
        3.21.3.3. OWO to AWM. A D7/RD transaction with a JON suffix and action suffix PK will be
        input to D035K and passed to G004L. The D035K system won’t change any of its balance values
        the G004L system minus the OWO value, plus the AWM, minus the JON induction value, and
        increase the remaining COQ. This transaction will also minus the values of weekly induction,
        monthly induction, and quarterly induction fields.

3.22. Awaiting Parts (AWP).
     3.22.1. Purpose. The purpose of the AWP balance is to decrease assets that were OWO and work
     stoppage due to lack of parts. Assets in AWP status must be maintained in a secured area. This trans-
     action is processed through D035 system by production support personnel with a RBOG transaction.
     3.22.2. Restrictions:
     3.22.3. Assets cannot be moved from supply to AWP.
        3.22.3.1. Work is not to be performed as assets and earned hours (production count) are not to be
        reported against assets while in AWP status.
        3.22.3.2. The use of AWP is not applicable to serialized workloads.
     3.22.4. Procedures. The following procedures identify production/supply transactions required for
     AWP processing. (Reference AFMCI 21-130 for detailed procedures):
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                             75


   3.22.5. OWO to AWP. A D7/RF transaction with a JON suffix and action suffix PK will be input to
   D035K and passed to G004L to move an item from OWO to AWP. This transaction will be passed by
   D035K without any change in the D035K balances. G004L will minus the OWO value, plus the AWP
   value, plus the RACOQ value, and minus the JON induction value by the quantity indicated. This
   transaction will also minus the values of weekly induction, monthly induction, and quarterly induction
   fields. Note: All transactions on G004L-L2A should be validated by the scheduler.
   3.22.6. AWP to OWO. A D7/RE transaction will be input with a current JON suffix and action suffix
   PK to the D035K system and passed to G004L. D035K won’t change any balances. G004L will minus
   the AWP value, plus the OWO, plus the JON induction and decrease the RACOQ by the quantity indi-
   cated. For EXPRESS items it must be fully funded. NOTE: All transactions on G004L-L2A should be
   validated by the scheduler.

3.23. Job Order Number Status Codes. The G004L JON master records will carry a status code, which
indicates the production status of each record.
   3.23.1. Status Code = Blank. There is no JON suffix. For permanent and temporary workload, a blank
   status code is established only at Control Number/Job Designator (CN/JD) level. For temporary work-
   load, valid input of 206, Part II established the CN/JD and a blank status code on the appropriate mas-
   ter file. Completions and production count aren’t allowed.
   3.23.2. Status Code = 0. The JON is open and active. For permanent JONs, this status code is estab-
   lished when the first induction is processed. For temporary nonserialized JONs, the status code will be
   set at 0 when a 237 with the Status of Planning Indicator (SOPI) marked complete processes validly.
   For temporary serialized workload, the status code will be set at 0 when the transaction processes. On
   temporary workloads, when JSC=0, the G004L-L3A, Temporary Job Record, is produced for the
   schedulers use. Completions, production count and material transactions are allowed.
   3.23.3. Status Code = 1. The JON is completed and sold. The JOQ has been inducted and all items
   have been completed for temporary JONs. Permanent JONs, all inductions have been completed at or
   after the end of the JON period (month or quarter). For temporary JONs, this code will be assigned
   regardless of JON period during the end-of-month processing cycle in which completions equal JOQ.
   Trailing production count and material transactions are still authorized. Action C- and S-prefix JONs
   will open with status code of 1 and are sold when they migrate to JSC 2 at the end of the month.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the S prefix is obsolete.
   3.23.4. Status Code = 2. The JON is closed. The code is assigned at End of Month (EOM) after the
   JON has been sold (SC=1 for a full month). No further actions are allowed. Trailing production count
   and material transactions aren’t allowed.
   3.23.5. Status Code = 3. The JON is cancelled. This code is assigned only at EOM. When this code
   applies to permanent JONs, it is assigned at the end of the JON period when the inductions, comple-
   tions, and OWO balance are 0. When this code applies to temporary JONs, it is assigned at the EOM
   when the JOQ equals 0. Trailing production count and material transactions aren’t allowed.
   3.23.6. Status Code = 7. The JON is history. The JON will be kept on the appropriate G004L master
   file until end of quarter (EOQ) so appropriate data can be passed to interfacing systems.
   3.23.7. Status Code = S. The JON is suspended. This applies to manufacture work accomplished on
   other than R or W reimbursement codes (first position of PCN). This status code is assigned on any
76                                                                    AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     processing day during the month when an 237 with the SOPI marked complete processes validly and
     the planned cost is greater than the estimated job total cost. A customer release (H1) transaction is
     required to return the JON to active status and production count transactions to be valid.

3.24. Priority Codes. These codes have been established for use in scheduling workload. This is a
two-position code assigned by the initiator of the AFMC Form 206 or AFMC Form 600D. See Attach-
ment 6 for description of codes.

3.25. Production Delay Codes. Production delay codes must be input by the schedulers for any tempo-
rary jobs where the JOQ has not been completed by the customer’s delivery date. Codes will be input for
permanent JONs when a scheduled or negotiated completion date has not or will not be met. The produc-
tion delay codes are necessary to provide feedback to the customer and to the MA internal management
units. Production delay codes are input with the 930 G004L File Maintenance Transactions. See Attach-
ment 7.
     3.25.1. To release, the productions delay code should be replaced with X production delay code when
     the job is back in work.
     3.25.2. For visibility, production delay codes will be reflected on the G004L-G1A/G3A/G3B/G3F/
     G3H/G5C/G5D/G5E/G6A/ L2A/L3B/L3C and L3G reports.

3.26. Production Count.
     3.26.1. Generally, the accumulation of production credits and standard costs in the DMAPS Financial
     Operation Procedures. M/D standard cost accounting systems is done through production count proce-
     dures. The responsibility for these procedures is shared by planning, scheduling, and data automation
     functions. Data produced must provide accurate production and cost data. The production count pro-
     cedures contribute to the financial position of the DMAG. Validity and timeliness of production count
     is required to ensure proper feedback of production data and costs to management.
     3.26.2. Objectives:
        3.26.2.1. To electronically accumulate standard direct material and direct labor information on
        work produced.
        3.26.2.2. To provide the basis for computing standard costs for use in financial management and
        analysis.
        3.26.2.3. To electronically accumulate workload data that applies to Program Control Number
        (PCN) and Repair Group Category (RGC).
        3.26.2.4. To obtain formal record of production.
     3.26.3. Production count will never be reported if it is not supported by an established labor standard
     operation. The rule applies to both programmed and nonprogrammed workloads.
     3.26.4. Procedures:
        3.26.4.1. Production count on unpredictable work (permanent JON) won’t be reported through
        use of 600A, unless a labor standard has been established in the labor standard master file.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II manual 600A production count is not allowed.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                            77


      3.26.4.2. From 237/240 transactions, data automation will electronically establish a tempo-
      rary labor standard master file. This allows the use of a 600A transaction for recording pro-
      duction count when PCI is M. Note: Under DMAPS Phase II this is not allowed.
      3.26.4.3. From the E046B product and the operation portion of the labor section of 237, when the
      production count indicator is M, scheduling personnel will oversee that production count data is
      transmitted by the remote using the 600A when the PCI=M (G014).
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II this is not allowed.
      3.26.4.4. Scheduling personnel determine the authorized and acceptable items of production
      accomplished by the shop during a production count period from source documents, which are an
      integral part of the production control system.
          3.26.4.4.1. Production count on serialized G097 items is input according to instructions con-
          tained in PDMSS. Production count for precision measuring equipment (PME) items is auto-
          matically generated and passed to G004L.
      3.26.4.5. When PCI=A, production count won’t be reported as operations are completed. The
      G004L system will automatically trigger all labor operations when end item completions are
      reported. Manual count won’t be accepted on JONs with PCI of A. Using ITS/TAA production
      count is reported as operations are completed. Note: Under DMAPS Phase II production count
      will not be reported.
      3.26.4.6. G004L electronically computes direct labor earned hours on each count card by extend-
      ing the operations completed by the standard direct labor hours per unit, as furnished by the
      E046B or G004L system.
      3.26.4.7. Cost accounting uses the data on various reports for recording the standard material,
      labor, and overhead costs. These costs are reflected in the operating cost reports and the standard
      labor hours are used to prepare earned hour reports.
      3.26.4.8. G004L electronically associates JON completion data with accumulated earned hours to
      notify G072A to move work-in-process to the completed work file and subsequent customer bill-
      ing by project order.
   3.26.5. Responsibilities, scheduling personnel will:
      3.26.5.1. Determine that authorized, completed, and acceptable production has been accom-
      plished.
      3.26.5.2. Support such determination with an accumulation and filing of appropriate source doc-
      uments.
      3.26.5.3. Maintain sufficient controls to ensure the forms submitted have been processed and that
      erroneous data or production count rejects are immediately corrected. The G004L-L2C, Daily
      Valid/Invalid Production Count, is used for this purpose.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II earned hours are not tracked.
   3.26.6. Authorized, Completed, and Acceptable Work. Production data obtained from production
   count procedures are required for the accumulation of standard costs for the M/D and will only be
   compiled on work that is authorized, completed, and acceptable.
78                                                                     AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


        3.26.6.1. Authorized Work. Authorized work is any production effort, which can be supported by
        the appropriate work authorization document. The work requirement may originate from Material
        Manager/Item Manager, base tenant, or from the M/D (Cost Class 4)/routed work.
        3.26.6.2. Completed Work. Normally, production count credit will be given to the RCC when the
        work is done.
        3.26.6.3. Acceptable Work. Work is defined as acceptable when it has been completed and
        inspected as conforming to specifications. Acceptable work won’t be interpreted to broaden or
        limit in any manner the quality assurance functions. These functions will continue to be carried
        out in accordance with applicable directives.
        3.26.6.4. When labor and material have been consumed in the process of overhauling or repairing
        an end item but the item is condemned or turned in AWP, all production count credit, including
        support shop time, will be backed out of the system when the PCI is M. The responsible Scheduler
        will contact the Program Manager/Item Manager/Planner/Workloader and request a 206 to cover
        labor and material expended on condemned work.
        3.26.6.5. When direct labor is expended, whether in the process of determining condition status or
        in the performance of a task which does not necessarily result in the production of serviceable end
        items, this type of effort must either be authorized by one of the service job designators E, F, G, J,
        L, and T or by the combination job designator H for non-MISTR production.
     3.26.7. Supporting Production Count Documents:
        3.26.7.1. The determination that authorized, completed, and acceptable production has been per-
        formed will be supported by a WCD.
        3.26.7.2. Validation of Work Control Documents. Work acceptance is indicated with a stamp and
        date by an authorized person on applicable work forms or source documents. See AFMCI 21-110.
        3.26.7.3. Supporting documentation for production count will be maintained IAW Records Infor-
        mation Management Systems at https://webrims.amc.af.mil after production count is taken.

3.27. Completion Transaction Processing. To ensure proper end item reporting, input of receipt and
turn-in documents must be accomplished on time. The production reported to the JON master system by
a 244 transaction, will be used along with other G004L production to update the project order register and
produce sales billing in DMAG.
     3.27.1. 244 transaction (Completions). Direct input of a 244 transaction input to the G004L system is
     limited to engines, Nuclear Ordnance Commodity Management (NOCM) items, and manufactured
     items not sent to supply. All other production items are turned into supply (D035K) by use of a 244
     transaction electronically update of systems G004L from D035K. These completions are input
     through remote devices to the D035K system. The G004L is updated by tape interface. The update
     appears on the G004L-L2A data products.
     3.27.2. System Completions. All JON master records with inductions from nonsupply sources
     (including serial-numbered items with DPC=9 on the master record) will be reported to G004L. Items
     removed from and returned to engines (PP 72-10 items) are reported to G004L. This production will
     include, but won’t be limited to, items processed for area support, base support, central acquisition,
     and renovating testing.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                                79


   3.27.3. Verification of Production Transaction. Visibility of the end-item completions transactions is
   reflected on the Daily Visibility and Cross Referenced List (G004L-L2A). The scheduler must verify
   all daily transactions by comparing the L2A and 105/130. Retain documents as required.
   3.27.4. File Maintenance of Item Completions. On occasion, erroneous reporting happens in the
   update process. The most common errors are reporting of excess quantities or updating the wrong
   JON master record.

3.28. Exchange Component Item Control. See Chapter 2 planning.

3.29. Condemnations for Programming Plan (PP) 72-10 FEEMS Items.
   3.29.1. It is important that condemnations be always turned in using the proper method when assets
   are generated from both supply and maintenance. This is to ensure that erroneous condemnations data
   are not being fed to the D041 system where they are used to compute buying requirements.
   3.29.2. All generations of PP 72-10 FEEMS items from A, major overhaul are routed off the engine.
   Items must have an established MISTR control number and will be inducted and processed on the
   same control number.
   3.29.3. All condemnations of PP 72-10 FEEMS assets whether from disassembly or during inspec-
   tion/processing should be processed against the applicable MISTR JON. These reported condemna-
   tions are used to determine the Depot Overhaul Condemnation Percent to be applied to the projected
   MISTR program of the PP 72-10 FEEMS item.
   3.29.4. All condemnations of designated Accessory PP 72-10 assets, whether from disassembly or
   during inspection/processing, that generate from B jobs should be processed against the applicable
   engine JON. These condemnations are used to determine the Engine Overhaul Job-routed Condemna-
   tion Percent to be applied to the projected B job portion of the future engine overhaul program.

3.30. Production Item Requisition for Preparation of Technical Data. When the development of
technical data for the M/D is required and the development of labor and material standards is required, use
job designator R. The asset will be ordered using P cost code. The item will be restored to serviceable
condition and the asset returned to stock. Work requirements will include development of repair proce-
dures for use in technical orders, development of parts list for use in the Reparability Forecast Module
(RFM) system, or other specified data.

3.31. Other Services, Depot Maintenance Interservice Agreement (DMISA), Production Item Pro-
cessing. Production items repaired by the ALC depot maintenance that are owned by a service activity
other than Air Force require special control for accounting purposes. The G004L system requires a sepa-
rate production number to be established for each customer when the same stock numbered end item is
repaired for other than the Air Force, because the reimbursement code for each service is different and the
end item accountability is maintained under different Ownership Purpose Codes (OPC) in the D035K sys-
tem. The 244 transaction (requisition) for these items must carry the ownership purpose code in the OPC
block. If the last digit of the job order suffix in the JON block, is not the same as the entry in OPC block,
the system will reject the transactions. It is imperative that the JON identity that is in the D7/RA transac-
tion be maintained with the end item during the repair process so that production count and material costs
can be accurately charged to the appropriate JON. The proper identification is also necessary to maintain
the correct DIOH/IN MA relationship. See Attachment 5 for the ownership purpose codes.
80                                                                     AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


3.32. Processing AFMC Form 127. The following instructions pertain to processing of AFMC Forms
137 and WCDs when used for the movement of end items or components to a support shop for repair,
modification, or service.
     3.32.1. Processing Routed Orders:
        3.32.1.1. AFMC Form 127 consists of a hard manila card and four tissue copies or a computer
        generated 137 all of which reflect identical data. The tissue copies are carbon interleaved so that
        the entries are impressed on all copies.
        3.32.1.2. Before moving an item to the receiving RCC for required maintenance, the production
        support function responsible for completing the form will:
            3.32.1.2.1. Remove the original tissue copy before routing the item.
            3.32.1.2.2. Send the original tissue copy to the production support function serving the RCC
            or work station determined as the final destination for the item.
     3.32.2. The production support function serving the final destination RCC or work station will main-
     tain a suspense file of the original copy of AFMC Form 127. This file will be maintained in stock
     number sequence, by the date the item is to be returned. This file will advise the scheduling activity
     serving the final destination RCC or work stations of the support to be provided from AFMC Form
     127 items rather than from serviceable items drawn from supply, and be used for follow up action.
     Upon receipt of the serviceable item or notification that the item has been condemned or turned-in to
     supply local instructions will be followed for disposition of the AFMC Form 127.
     3.32.3. The activity responsible for scheduling the work in the support RCC will ensure:
        3.32.3.1. Appropriate entries on the AFMC Form 127 have been made. The scheduling activity
        will review PLN Due Date block to determine that the date can be met or if a new date must be
        negotiated with the initiator of the form.
        3.32.3.2. After completion and acceptance of the work performed, a copy of the AFMC Form 127
        is retained for production count purpose. This is necessary if production count credit is to be accu-
        mulated daily.
        3.32.3.3. The copy of AFMC Form 127 will remain with the item until reinstallation and accep-
        tance has been completed. At that time, the AFMC Form 127 will be removed by the inspector
        approving the reinstallation.
     3.32.4. Condemned Component Items. The support RCC will return the condemned component to the
     initiating RCC using the routing form(s). A DD Form 1577, Unserviceable Condemned Tag Mate-
     rial, will be attached to the component. The originating RCC will make the turn-in to supply (AFMCI
     21-130).
     3.32.5. For items removed from an end item for accessibility:
        3.32.5.1. The mechanic will remove the designated item, initiate appropriate documentation that
        the item was removed for accessibility and is in a serviceable condition and stored in the appropri-
        ate designated area.
        3.32.5.2. The item will, when applicable, be delivered to the RCC or work station responsible for
        reinstallation.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                              81


3.33. Rework (for items still in maintenance). Rework is in the labor to repair or replace failed mate-
rial or end items, or to correct a work discrepancy, after the acceptability or completion of the work step
(operation), or end item has been stamped on the Work Control Document by production personnel. Pro-
duction count will not be taken for operations undergoing rework. The material used in rework will be
charged to control number U6800 with cost code L for those items normally costed under codes A and L
and cost code X for those items normally costed under code D or M. Charges will be made to control
number U6812 with cost code X for those items normally costed under code E or J. The labor expended
for this effort will be accepted to duty code .26 with special project code 14 in the RCC where explained.
The following categories are not rework:
   3.33.1. Unavoidable periodic calibrations and adjustments
   3.33.2. Work normally required to hand-fit or select-fit parts in an assembly. This type of work will
   be included in the labor standard by means of an occurrence factor.
   3.33.3. Work required repairing material received with existing defects or deficiencies.
   3.33.4. Work done as a result of incoming or preliminary diagnostic tests and inspections which are
   made to determine necessary repairs and replacements. When an item fails a particular step in a diag-
   nostic test composed of a number of sequential steps, is then repaired, but subsequently fails a later
   step in that test, rework won’t be charged unless the subsequent failure is attributed to a discrepancy
   in the earlier repair.
   3.33.5. Additional work performed as part of the most economical method of doing a job, if substan-
   tiated by an engineering economic analysis. The exclusion doesn’t apply when the additional work is
   required to correct work previously done on an item.

3.34. Local Manufacture Procedures. Local manufacture (M-prefix) planning procedures are divided
into two categories. These categories are R or W and all others. The reimbursement code, which is the
first position of the PCN, determines the category. Reference AFMCI 21-130
   3.34.1. When the reimbursement codes are R or W the following procedures apply:
       3.34.1.1. When direct material is required, the jacket file furnished by the planning organization
       will be incomplete. The JON suffix and the Temporary Job Record (G004L-L3A) will not be
       included, but the jacket file must be filed in the local manufacture awaiting material file. The
       jacket will remain incomplete until all the direct material is received and the planner indicates on
       the AFMC Form 237 that planning is complete.
       3.34.1.2. A copy of AFMC Form 237 is sent to Shop Service Center, (SSC), personnel for mate-
       rial requisition. (Reference AFMCI 21-129).
       3.34.1.3. SSC personnel will order material at production number level using local manufacture
       procedures contained in AFMCMAN 21-5 and AFMCI 21-130.
       3.34.1.4. The planning activity is notified when all required material has been received. This is a
       key function as it is the only notification the planner receives on the availability of material.
       3.34.1.5. After the Status of Planning Indicator (SOPI) is changed to complete by the planner, a
       JON suffix and G004L-L3A is furnished and the jacket moved to the normal files. A JON Status
       Code (JSC) of zero 0 will be assigned automatically and work can begin on these items. The JSC
       S is not applicable for M-Prefix JONs with reimbursement codes of R or W.
82                                                                   AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


     3.34.2. When the reimbursement codes are other than R or W the following procedures apply:
        3.34.2.1. The jacket file won’t be forwarded to the scheduler until the SOPI is marked complete.
        The JON suffix will already be assigned and the G004L-L3A will be included in the package.
        3.34.2.2. Material can be ordered and work can begin under normal procedures.
        3.34.2.3. Part Number Manufacture Items. Manufactured material will be turn-in to the SSC/
        WSSC from which it will be issued to the floor. A 244 transaction D6 wash post turn-in will be
        used to accomplish the turn-in by placing the appropriate supply designator in MIC Designator
        field and the control number job designator in the appropriate field. All issues for part number
        locally manufactured D7 issues must contain a 2 in the Y credit indicator field of the 244 transac-
        tion transactions. The issue must also contain the JON on which used.
        3.34.2.4. NSN manufactured items will be turned in to supply as a normal supply turn-in.
        3.34.2.5. Manufactured material for use within maintenance will be moved, upon completion, to
        the SSC/WSSC from which it will be issued and a 244 transaction will be prepared and input to
        update the D035K records and to update the storage SSC/WSSC quantities.
     3.34.3. File maintenance of the delivery date on manufactured JONs will be accomplished using 930
     transaction. The revised delivery date will be overlaid into the D035K system due-in record using the
     updated G004L record. The transaction will be printed on the G004L-L2A/L3C/L3G listing one time.
     The original delivery date will be retained by G004L to produce the G004L-G6A report, reflecting
     delayed workloads. The updated delivery date overlay into the D035K system replaces the local man-
     ufacture follow-up as prescribed in AFMCI 21-130. Schedulers must update the delivery date with the
     most realistic date possible.

3.35. Due In From Overhaul (DIOH) In Maintenance Control. General: Production items subject to
DIOH/In Maintenance Control are those items with data processing codes of T, 2, or X (excluding job
designator K).
     3.35.1. All items enter the DIOH/In Maintenance balances at time of receipt of property at M/D and
     are reduced from these balances at the time of turn-in. The To and From intransit systems in D035K
     control and account for assets enroute from Supply to M/D, and from M/D to Supply, changes to these
     accounts are caused by maintenance production transactions entering the D035K system. Changes to
     these accounts by properly prepared transactions are a responsibility of M/D.
     3.35.2. The DIOH account is reflected as an M balance on the document transaction image. DIOH
     reductions are reflected as a minus (-) between the quantity and the M. Increases are reflected by a
     quantity preceding the M, with no sign in between. DIOH/In Maintenance reconciliation’s identify
     this quantity as DIOH.
     3.35.3. The intransit from Supply to M/D is reflected as an MW balance on the daily document con-
     trol register. Reductions contain a minus (-) sign, while increases contain no sign. DIOH/In Mainte-
     nance reconciliation listing identifies this balance as intransit to (INTR TO).
     3.35.4. The intransit from (INTR FM) M/D to Supply is reflected as an M M balance on the daily
     document control register. Reductions contain a minus (-) sign, while increases contain no sign. This
     balance is reflected on the DIOH/In Maintenance reconciliation listings as INTR FM.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                             83


   3.35.5. Production type transactions that don’t change the DIOH, MW, or MM, balances will be
   reflected on the document control register with an asterisk (*) between the quantity and the balance
   symbol.
   3.35.6. The keys to proper management to these balances are the document control register, the reject
   management products provided by the D035K and G004L systems on a daily basis, the AFMC Form
   105, AFMC Form 130, and the G004L-L2A, Daily End Item Production Account Visibility and
   Cross-reference List. Errors not corrected on a timely basis become extremely complicated, require
   excessive research, and consume an unnecessary amount of man-hours to correct.
   3.35.7. G004L Products specifically designed for DIOH/In Maintenance control include the follow-
   ing:
      3.35.7.1. G004L-W5C-W1-MWW, DIOH/In Maintenance Out-Of –Balance Records by PS/SD.
      Minor sequence is stock number. This report identifies those stock numbers and associated JONs
      that are out of balance.
      3.35.7.2. G004L-W5D-W1-MWW. Erroneous Production Transactions by PS/SD. Minor
      sequence is stock number. This report identifies production transactions that are rejected in
      G004L, with a code indicating the reason for reject. (971 rejects are also listed for info, although
      these don’t affect DIOH). Only those transactions related to out of balance records will be retained
      in the G004L transaction history file.
      3.35.7.3. G004L-W5B-W1-MWW, Maintenance Production History, has all transactions for the
      current week plus the same rejects described above, by stock number. The product could prove
      useful in determining whether or not a reject has been corrected.
   3.35.8. Reject and Error Corrections:
   3.35.9. Issue Transactions:
      3.35.9.1. Receipt Acknowledgement (RA) is input and updates DIOH and INTR TO but rejects in
      G004L. Common causes of G004L rejects and corrections required are:
          3.35.9.1.1. Job Order number (JON) is not open in G004L. After ensuring the G004L opening
          has been completed, a new RA transaction must be submitted with an action suffix of PK. This
          input will bypass DIOH/intransit and update OWO and JON induction balances only.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II these inputs to ITS and G004L will be addressed under a local
operating instruction.
          3.35.9.1.2. An error on the RA which passed D035K edits but rejected in G004L. This type
          rejection is usually caused by JON (control number, job designator, and JON suffix) error. A
          new RA with corrected information must be input with an action suffix of PK.
          3.35.9.1.3. Quantity on the RA exceeds the JOQ in G004L. If any portion of JOQ remains
          unissued in G004L, cut a new RA for that quantity, and re-input with PK action suffix. Prepare
          D6 for remaining quantity with 00000A control number/job designator, (CN/JD) and JON suf-
          fix of 00A and return item to Supply. The new RA for authorized quantity will bypass DIOH
          and post in G004L. D6 turn-in for remaining quantity, after input will pass the G004L, and
          reject. This turn-in will reduce DIOH for the quantity unauthorized in G004L. Contact the
          Retail Item Manager (RIM) for assistance, Reference AFMCI 21-129.
84                                                                    AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


               3.35.9.1.3.1. RA is prepared and input in error on post-post or wash post type issues. On
               action suffix PP or WP, no RA is needed. If one is submitted in error and rejects in G004L,
               it will require reversal with 00000A CN/JD and 00A JON suffix. If the RA was accepted in
               G004L, it will be reversed with the correct JON to reduce both DIOH and OWO. Both
               these reversals must be input by the retail item manager (RIM), reference AFMCI 21-129.
               3.35.9.1.3.2. For other type production issue errors, the type of correction will depend on
               whether or not the G004L rejects the transaction. When G004L rejects and OWO increase
               is required, the action suffix must be PK. If the transactions are duplicate and rejected in
               G004L, the reversal must have 00000A CN/JD (LGS input) and 00A JON suffix. Contact
               RIM, reference AFMCI 21-129.
               3.35.9.1.3.3. Post-post or wash post rejects in G004L. Prepare a duplicate copy of D7 with
               PK action suffix and resubmit after reason for reject is cleared.
               3.35.9.1.3.4. Post-post or wash post duplicates input. If G004L rejected, have Supply
               reverse with 00000A CN/JD and 00A JON suffix transaction was accepted in G004L, have
               reverse transaction with correct JON. Contact RIM, reference AFMCI 21-129.
               3.35.9.1.3.5. Turn-In Errors. Most common errors and required corrections are as follows:
                   3.35.9.1.3.5.1. D6 document is input more than one time.
                   3.35.9.1.3.5.2. If the duplicate transaction input reduced G004L, the transaction must

                                    ATTRITION BASED PLANNING

Section 4A—

4.1. General. The Air Logistics Center (ALC) and AMARC Maintenance Directorate manages organic
depot-level maintenance production facilities required to repair and modify Air Force materiel. Attrition
Based Planning (ABP) is an integral part of the workload planning functions in the mission of the ALC to
deliver serviceable goods to the end customer within the negotiated due dates. Attrition Based Planning
(ABP) is the method of applying known or historical factors that influence flow days to the planning and
schedule process. The ABP factors impacting the planning time line are in the four categories of labor
availability, climatic conditions, latent defects, and equipment condition. It is a fact that these factors can
positively or negatively affect the flow days at different times of the year. The objective of this policy is
to incorporate each of these elements into the planning process in order to create a more accurate delivery
date to the end customer.

4.2. Purpose of Attrition Based Planning. The purpose of applying ABP to the traditional planning
methodologies is to align the projected flow days schedule with the influencing factors that are outside of
the control of the production process. By using the Production Planning Team to construct the attrition
tables, a greater degree of visibility is obtained in seeing the factors that change flow days on a seasonal
basis. All facilities, and even shops within facilities, will not have the same attrition table. The influencing
factors that impact the attrition table will change with location, culture, and product group.

4.3. Relationship with Other Functions. The attrition based planning function depends on the work-
load function, the scheduling function located throughout the production shops, the human resources
group, and the production function of the various shops which accomplish repair processes or services on
end items for which the planning organization is responsible. It is the concurrent efforts of these functions
that establishes and maintains the attrition factors used for the shops under their jurisdiction.
     4.3.1. Workload Control. The workload function provides requirements for which the repair capabil-
     ity exists, and ensures ample lead time for setting up the basic Job Order Number (JON), labor, and
     material standards (Chapter 1). The appropriate lead time used for delivery schedules is adjusted by
     the determined attrition factors for each month within the production period.
     4.3.2. Scheduling. The scheduling function uses the tools provided by planning to ensure proper shop
     loading of end items and manpower, the acquisition of the component parts required by the production
     shops to produce serviceable end items, and a measurement capability of the shop's performance. The
     historical measurement of shop performance is used to help determine the impact of seasonal, defect
     related, and equipment related month by month changes within the calendar year (s). Scheduling per-
     sonnel are active members of the Production planning teams, and as such, support the planning func-
     tion in the depot production process.
     4.3.3. Production. Production units produce project orders as assigned. The production unit provides
     direct feedback regarding current workload status such as unplanned material requirements, work
     control document, and technical data discrepancies etc. When production personnel note recurrent
     changes in the condition of inducted materiel or amounts of labor and materials required, the produc-
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                                87


   tion planning team should be informed. Production personnel are active members of the Production
   planning teams, and as such, support the planning function in the depot production process.
   4.3.4. Human Resources. The Personnel Branch, as part of the production planning team, has the
   responsibility of providing historical absenteeism data to the planning team to help establish the attri-
   tion tables.

4.4. Attrition Factors. Each of the Attrition Based Planning factors is defined as follows:
   4.4.1. Labor Availability. The availability of labor directly affects the ability of production to execute
   the scheduled work. The elements of labor availability are listed as :
       4.4.1.1. Calendar days vary accordingly with the month.
       4.4.1.2. Holidays and negotiated days of leave vary accordingly with the month.
       4.4.1.3. Personal vacation days tend to be centered around certain times of the year.
       4.4.1.4. End of Year (use or lose) vacation is concentrated in the forth quarter.
       4.4.1.5. Special events such as sporting events, festivals, and hunting season impact availability.
   4.4.2. Climatic Conditions. Weather can adversely affect the production ability and availability for
   reasons of :
       4.4.2.1. Unsafe flight conditions for functional check flights.
       4.4.2.2. Maintenance outdoors is restricted due to extremes of cold, heat, or rain.
       4.4.2.3. Acceptance or deliver of end items is impeded.
   4.4.3. Latent Defects. These defects are generally attributable to the age of the product being main-
   tained and are not obviously apparent until the maintenance process has been started. Historical
   records should be examined to determine if there is a trend shift in latent defects that would negatively
   impact the number of flow days.
   4.4.4. Equipment Condition. As the equipment is deployed to various field operations, conditions will
   be encountered that will change the physical condition of items being returned to maintenance. Con-
   sideration should be given to the environments in which deployment takes place, thereby creating
   addition work for the maintenance facilities.

4.5. Responsibilities. It is the responsibility of the Production Planning Teams to construct the attrition
planning tables.

4.6. Application. Incorporate attrition based planning and scheduling practices into MRRB process
(AFMC Financial Management Reference System (FMRS) Chapter 93). Attrition planning tables will be
incorporated into applicable data systems (i.e., G097 – PDMSS for aircraft, G402A for exchangeables,
MRO (future)).
88                                                                 AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


4.7. Review. Attrition factors will be reviewed and updated for appropriateness and accuracy during each
workload planning cycle.

Terms
Advice Code—A code used by the requestor which tells the source of supply how to fill the requisition.
The code assigned should provide sufficient information to the item manager for making a decision on
how to support/fill the requirement. The accurate assignment of the code will preclude unnecessary delays
98                                                                   AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


in the shipment of needed assets.
Air Logistic Center (ALC)—An AFMC depot operational activity charged with organically
accomplishing repair and modification tasks; contracting with industry for manufacture or repair as
directed by the System Program Manager and/or Materiel Manager (SPM/MM) for assigned weapon
systems, equipment or items of supply; and providing worldwide technical and logistics support for Air
Force operational units, other serviced agencies, and foreign military customers.
Annual Customer Order Quantity (ACOQ)—Five-digit numeric entry on permanent nonserialized
JONs that contains the fourth quarter negotiated net input quantity.
Awaiting Maintenance (AWM)—A balance which may be used to account for assets prepositioned into
maintenance without obligation of customer funds; to retain visibility of assets accounted for under Due
In From Overhaul (DIOH) in the D035K system; and to allow deobligation of customer funds when assets
are On Work-Order (OWO) and work is discontinued for a period of time for any reason except awaiting
parts, items in maintenance that are received but are not on work order or awaiting parts.
Awaiting Parts (AWP)—A balance which may be used to deobligate customer funds for assets that were
OWO and work has been stopped due to lack of parts, items in maintenance which are nonsupportable
because of lack of parts.
Bachelor Items—An item that has no interchangeable relationship to another item and which will receive
no automatic substitution from distribution or the Shop Service Center (SSC) stocks.
Backorder—Material that is not available for issue (same as a due-out). It is a D035K computer-recorded
obligation to issue the material at a subsequent date when it becomes available.
Batch Single Processing Indicator—A single alpha coded (B for batch-processed and S for single item
processing) input on the temporary JON labor plan (AFMC Form 237).
Benefiting Production Number (BPN)—A production number which is supported by one or more
Support Production Numbers (SPNs).
Bench Stock Items-N—ERRC coded indirect consumption material items authorized for free access in a
production shop area to ensure an uninterrupted work flow.
Bill Of Material (BOM)—A descriptive and quantitative listing of components required to manufacture,
overhaul, or repair a designated end item, assembly, or subassembly. This input allows costing of all
material to a specific JON and can be updated at any time up to completion of the last item on a temporary
JON. The G004L contains the BOM for temporary JONs and G005M contains the BOM for permanent
JONs.
Bulk Material—Material stored and issued by volume, footage, weight, or liquid measurement, such as
petroleum, bar stock, and lumber.
Cannibalization—Removing an assembly, subassembly, component, or part from an end item by a
maintenance activity for use on an end item undergoing depot repair. The appropriate inventory or supply
manager must authorize and pay for this action. DMAG is not authorized to conduct cannibalizations
without the proper authorizations and payments.
Carcass Cost—The value of an asset when the Latest Repair Cost and Center Direct/Indirect Allocable
Cost Recovery plus General and Administrative Cost Recovery at the Latest Acquisition Cost nave been
removed from the Standard Price of the item.

Center Direct/Indirect Cost Recovery At Latest Acquisition Cost—The portion of the cost recovery
element that the Air Logistics Centers can influence as applied to the Latest Acquisition Cost. Center
Direct/Indirect Cost Recovery is expenses developed by the wholesale division with input from the
Inventory Control Point. They are supply operations costs, DLA receipt costs, second destination
transportation costs, and depreciation (capital investment) costs.
Center Direct/Indirect Cost Recovery At Latest Repair Cost—The portion of the cost recovery
element that the Air Logistics Centers can influence as applied to the Latest Repair Cost. Center Direct/

MAJ to determine the work requirements. MAWW uses to estimate the cost of the work and bid for the
workload.-
Request File—A file maintained in the G004L system for all AFMC Forms 206. Part 2 creates a skeleton
temporary JON master record. When the labor plan and Bill of Material (BOM) (AFMC FORM 237) has
been input, with Status of Planning Indicator complete, the temporary JON master, temporary labor
standard, and temporary BOM files are setup.
Request Number—An eight-position alphanumeric character number assigned by the initiator of a
temporary work request. It is designed to indicate whether the customer is M/D, DMA, DAIS, or tenant
and used for routing of data system products to the customer.

are collected and related to JON.
Reversal—A transaction which reverses the original computer action.
Rob-Back—A production-authorized removal of an assembly subassembly or component part from an
aircraft or end item, within the maintenance repair process, to repair a like aircraft or end item for the
purpose of meeting specific schedules. Rob-backs will be initiated by the scheduler after all other sources
of supply have been exhausted.
Routing Identifier (RID)—A computer code used to identify ownership and location of a specific source
of supply. It may be used to identify local purchase or organic manufacture. A three-position alpha code
may be used in a request for issue.
Safety Level—The quantity of an item needed to permit continuous operation during stock replenishment
cycle with a specified level of confidence, providing normal crisply lead time is uninterrupted and or
demand remains fairly constant.
Save List—Programmed reclamation of 5 or more aircraft or end items with a project number established
by a System Program Office or HQ Air Force. Imps provide AFMC Forms 110 for items to be removed
from a select group of assets to fulfill projected requirements
Sensitive Item—Material which requires a high degree of protection and control due to statutory
requirements or regulations. (See AFMCI 21-130 for codes.).
Shop Service Center (SSC)—The SSC is the standard materiel support function for depot maintenance
in AFMC. The SSC is an aggregate of functional components involved in providing materiel to the Fixer,
acting as a trouble shooter for solving pats problems, or if possible, preventing them. It also serves as a
mini-supply storage area located in or near the Fixer's work area. Frequently used materiel is physically
located as close to the Fixer as practical. This material is owned and managed by a depot supply account.
Unserviceable end items Consolidated Repair Inventory (CRI) is also prepositioned to expedite repair.
This materiel will be stored in the SSC based on need and available storage space. Existing Depot
Maintenance Support Centers (DMSCs) are being converted to SSCs under the Depot Repair
Enhancement Program (DREP). New SSCs based on the requirements of the Fixer, will be established
after negotiations with the Fixer. During negotiations, the Fixer and SSC Chief will decide NSNs to be
stored, levels required, and the size of the CRI. All actions are performed to provide comprehensive and
effective support in the form of materiel planning, production scheduling, workloading, retail item
management, item research, order placement, materiel storage, inventory, and distribution, local
procurement, process analysis, and other key materiel related processes.
Source Of Supply (SOS)—The agency to which requisitions are sent for resupply action.
Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM)—A n S B S S c o m p u t e r d e t a i l

items (excluding subsistence), remains constant throughout a fiscal year except for the correction of
significant errors. This price includes the Latest Acquisition Cost plus the General and Administrative
Overhead Cost Recovery at Latest Acquisition Cost and Center Direct/Indirect Allocable Cost Recovery
at Latest Acquisition Cost. A Standard Price is computed for each Air Force-managed RSD I&S subgroup
master NSN. This same price is applied to all NSNs in that subgroup. If the subgroup is two-way
interchangeable, it could have a different price than the family master.
Standard Reporting Designator (SRD)—Required for all M/D material issue and backorder
requisitions. The SRD entry will greatly improve bit/piece subassembly supportability to maintenance by
linking these parts to a specific end item or system. The SRD converts to a Weapon System Designator
Code that DLA uses in its buy policy for depot support.
Status Code—A series of codes used for transmitting the status from the material manager or source of
supply to the requisitioner.

end items, and components during depot maintenance repair. A support shop may accomplish end item
repair (responsible for the end item), repair of a component related to an end item for which another RCC
is responsible, or unique processes (chemical analysis, plating, etc).
Support Production Number (SPN)—A permanent P-prefix production number with an I job
designator. These production numbers are derived from a consolidation of several common items or
processes into one common production number and their correlation to BPN is reflected on the Support
JON Master.

material requisitioned.
Validation Table. Various G004L tables are used to edit the inputs for JON establishment and production
count. These tables contain all valid established MDS identities, CAI identities, planning organizations,
planner technician codes, production sections, scheduling designators, Resource Control Centers (RCCs),
RCC rates, Program Control Numbers/Project Order Numbers (PCN/PONs), customer organizations,
FCRNs, and cost class IV Table.
Work Authorization Document (WAD). A document that authorizes the expenditure of labor, material,
and other related costs to do the work requested by a specific Customer.
Wash post (WP). The transfer of material accountability from one account to another within production
maintenance without physically moving material through distribution. This is a paperwork transaction
only in which a corresponding issue and turn-in posts as a two-legged or four-legged process
Work Stoppage (Due To Parts Unavailability). A condition that exists when sufficient parts or material
are not available to allow for the continuation of work within a production area, when this occurs,
expedited supply actions are required.

                                    DATA PROCESSING CODES
Data Processing Codes. All opening 206 and 600D will contain the applicable data processing code
(DPC) as per the usage assignment described below. The scheduler will use these codes as the basis for
determining how and what to report to the G004L system.
       (1) Code 2 signifies that production for serial numbered end items will be reported through the
D035K system to the End Item Production segment of the G004L data system by a 244 transaction. Ref-
erence DPC 9 for those serial numbered items in repair group category H and L requisitioned from supply
on a 244 transaction.
       (2) Code 6 signifies the workload is on a serialized JON to be sold at the unit price entered in a
206. JON completions will be reported to the G004L system by a 971.
       (3) Code 7 signifies a serialized workload to be limited to the cost entered in block 14 (Estimated
Job Total Cost) of the 206. JON completions will be reported to the G004L system by a 971.
       (4) Code 9 signifies that production for serial numbered end items will be reported to the end item
production segment of the G004L system by a 971. Those serial numbered items in repair group category
H and L requisitioned from supply by a 244 transaction must have inductions reported to the G004L sys-
tem by a 971 and items turned in to supply by a 244 transaction.
       (5) Code K signifies that production will be reported directly to the end item production segment
of G004L by a 244 transaction. DPC K applies only to complete aircraft engines, gas turbine engines, and
engine gearboxes at the overhaul ALCs.
      (6) Code N signifies that production will be reported to the end item production segment of the
G004L system by a 971.
        (7) Code S signifies the workload is a T-prefix tenant support JON which is of a continuous nature
and is reinitialized at the beginning of each quarter. Production will be reported to the G004L system by a
971. The G004L system will assign QSI=M and UOM=HR to these transactions.
       (8) Code T signifies that production will be reported through D035K to the end item production
segment of G004L by a 244 transaction and applies to base support (DIOH and local manufacture) item
records maintained in the D035K system except those items that are controlled and reported by serial
number or items with a job designator F, L, M, N, or T.
        (9) Code U means that production will be reported directly to the end item production segment of
G004L by 244 transaction to update the 244 transaction IN-MA balance. DPCU will be used for NOCM
items (materiel management code (MMC) CM or federal supply group (FSC) of 11) that require turn-in to
special weapons supply. NOCM items not requiring turn-in to special weapons supply will have DPC N.
U DPC is used for manufactured items returned to a customer when not processed through the D035K
system.
        (10) Code X signifies that production may be reported by either 244 transaction or 971. This code
applies only to XD items that are engine components and are being worked as MISTR items. The 971 will
be used to report engine components that are removed from an engine reparable (card code R) and
returned to an engine serviceable or condemned (card code S). If the item also generates as reparable from
the field, 244 transaction will be used to request the item from D035K (document identifier D7) and to
114                                                                    AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


turn in the item to D035K (document identifier D6). The D035K system will pass these transactions to the
end item production segment of G004L by a daily tape. However, the majority of MISTR items aren’t
engine components so their DPC will remain T. (Only 244 transaction reporting through D035K to the
end item production segment of G004L is allowed.) Also, code X applies only to the engine TRCs (Okla-
homa City ALC).
Note: Data processing code changes are authorized when no inductions have been made. The following
conditions apply:
         a. If the code indicates a supply sourced item, the data code may be changed to reflect a nonsup-
ply source if IN/MA balance is zero.
           b. If the code indicates a nonsupply sourced item, the data code can be changed to a supply
source.
           c. If the code indicates serial number control, the data code can’t be changed to nonserial number
control.
         d. If the code indicates nonserial number control, it can’t be changed to indicate serial number
control unless the JON suffix is blank (applicable to both temporary and permanent control numbers).

                           Allowable Migrations of G004L JON Status Codes:
Migration              Definitions
Blank to 0             This migration opens the JON. It can occur on any processing day during the
month: (1) When the first 244 transaction induction for a given permanent JON processes validly in
G004L. (2) For SOPI controlled temporary JONs (which are not (a) serialized, (b) C or S- prefixed, (c)
tenant support with DPC=S), when a 237 with an SOPI marked complete processes validly. (3) For
Non-SOPI controlled temporary JONs (which are either (a) serialized, (b) C or S-prefixed with DPC other
than P, (c) tenant support with DPC=S), when an 237 (C card) is processed validly.
Blank to S              This migration suspenses the JON. It can occur on any processing day during the
month when a 237 with the SOPI marked complete processes validly and the planned cost is greater than
the estimated job total cost.
0 to 1                This migration closes the JON and it applies to both permanent and temporary.
This migration occurs only in an end of month (EOM) processing cycle. For permanent JONs, the JON
period must be over and all inducted items must have been completed. For temporary JONs the comple-
tions must equal the JOQ regardless of JON period.
0 to 3                This migration cancels the JON, and it applies to both permanent and temporary
JONs. It can occur only if an EOM processing cycle just before the record is passed to G004B/G072A.
For permanent JONs, the JON period must be over and the JON inductions must be equal to 0. (This may
be caused by an induction reversal or by a turn-in resulting in no credit.) Also for permanent production
numbers this can occur at EOM if the production number has been deleted using a 930. For temporary
JONs, the JOQ must be equal to 0 (JOQ reduced to 0 using a 930).
Note:                  Under DMAPS Phase II the G072A will be obsolete.
1 to 0                This migration reopens the JON, and it applies to both permanent and temporary
JONs. It can occur on any processing day during the month following the EOM in which the JON is
closed. For both permanent and temporary JONs, it occurs which a valid completion reversal processes
against a closed JON.
1 to 2                 This migration occurs only in EOM processing cycle after the JON has had a status
code of 1 month. Both G004B and G072A will receive a given JON with a status code of 2 only once.
These records will remain in status code 2 for one full month and will be inaccessible to any production
transactions (244 transaction/ inductions or completion), control data changes (PCN, PON, FCRN or
serial number), production count, or material transactions.
Note:                  Under DMAPS Phase II the G072A will be obsolete.
2 to 7 This migration is to retain the JON for historical reasons. At the end of each quarter, it permits the
correct recording of status code 2 records in intermediate cycle of G004B processed before the end of
month position has been recorded by the monthly cycle of G004B. It also is the method employed to
retain JONs with quarterly serviceable completions or quarterly condemnations on the master file until
end of quarter. These records must be retained for interfacing this history to D041/G004G/K051 during
the end of quarter processing. Status code 7 records are inaccessible to any transactions.
S to 0               This migration opens the JON. It applies to temporary JONs only and can occur on

S to 7                 This migration moves the JON to History. It applies to temporary JONs only and
occurs at EOM in which planned cost is greater than estimated cost and the customer has submitted an H-I
transaction reducing the JOQ to 0. This record is not passed to G072A.
Note: For the JSC, S is not applicable for T-Prefix JONs with unit of measure of each (EA). It will not
apply to M-Prefix JONs with R or M reimbursement codes either. The only suspended actions will occur
between workloading and the customer.

                               PRODUCTION ITEM COST CODES
These transactions are for the issue of items for depot repair and for turn-in of these items after
completion of repair. Production items which are returned in a nonserviceable a condition are also
coded as production turn-in transactions. Transactions bearing production cost codes won’t result
in charges or credits for inclusion in actual material cost accumulation.

Cost    Description
F       Quality Control of Prototype Analysis. For the issue of items for quality assurance,
        inspection, analysis, UR exhibits, prototype analysis, and the return of items previously
        issued for these purposes. This code will be used along with the appropriate production
        RCC code. Items removed from the production line for quality analysis and return to line
        will be turned in under the P rather than the F code.
P       Production. For the issue of reparable, TOC, or incomplete assets to be made serviceable
        or issue or serviceable assets with job designator R, resulting with the turn-in of
        serviceable, TOC, incomplete, and condemned assets.

        or reclamation and the return of reclaimed components. This code will apply to the issue
        of assets for renovation proof testing purposes and for the turn-in of the remaining items
        following the test evaluation.
V       Production Correction. For the return of production items that are received misidentified
        as to stock number or condition. (Incorrect item is turned in as a V cost code under
        control number of item originally requested. Correction issue is on a P, F, or H cost code,
        as appropriate.)

                                    MATERIAL COST CODES
These codes are used by the planner during the preparation of the BOM segment and BOM Adjust-
ment (G005M). Materials are classified as investment and expense. Investment material includes all
recoverable assemblies, installed equipment items, and modification kits acquired from investment
(CP) appropriation. Expense material consists of all material and parts used in maintenance not
categorized by investment or production cost codes. Special purpose codes X and Z are established
for unusual issue/turn-in requirements.

Table A10.1. G004L Message Codes/Purpose Message.
Codes     Purpose
A         Denotes a manual production count transaction which was rejected because it was
          processed against a JON with a PCI equal to A.
ERR*      Denotes a transaction has data element error.
ERR-D     Denotes that the control data (request number, control number/job designator,
          operation number, JON, etc.) is duplicate of a record already on a master file in the
          G004L system. The master record which this transaction duplicates is printed for
          visibility so that analysis can be accomplished to determine if just the control data
          duplicated on the entire transaction duplicates the master record already in the file.
          The master record which has the same control data as the rejected transaction will
          appear on the product with a REF-D message code. Those transactions which
          completely duplicate an existing record need no further action. Those which duplicate
          only the control data must be corrected by assigning no duplicative data.
ERR-F     Denotes that a 237 C transaction was submitted in a calendar time frame that is prior
          to the project order period indicated on the request number master file as input on the
          206. The 237 C transaction cannot be input until the project order period is equal to
          the processing period of the 237 C transaction. ERR-I Denotes an erroneous
          transaction in an attempt to update a JON Master Record.
ERR-J     Denotes an erroneous JOQ change to a DIOH-related record which would decrease
          the JOQ value below the JON induction balance (930 transaction).
ERR-U     Denotes a transaction was processed which was unmatched to the JON Master files.
ERR-B     Denotes a valid 206 B transaction processed which established a temporary JON
          Master Record. EST-C Denotes a valid 237 transaction was processed which
          established a temporary JON Master Record only after 206 was valid as EST-B.
EST-F     Denotes a valid 600D transaction processed and established in the permanent JON
          Master (PJM) Record. EST-G Denotes a valid transaction processed which set up a
          serialized JON Master Record (G transaction).
EST-P     The first valid induction has been made to open a new permanent JON.
CHG-A     Addendum has been processed and changed the EISP. It appears on the L2A report
          with pound signs over the EISP.
CHG-D     Denotes a deletion transaction (H6/H8) which processed against a JON Master
          Record.
CHG-H     Denotes an AFMC 930 transaction was processed which changed data in the Master
          Record (# over data element denotes a change in that element).
CHG-M     Denotes that the element with #s over it has been mass changed.
REF-A     Denotes a valid 206, part I (A transaction) processed which establish Request Number
          Master Record.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                            133


Codes    Purpose
REF-B    Denotes a valid transaction was processed to a temporary Jon Master Record.
REF-D    Denotes a master record which has had a transaction attempt to duplicate the control
         data for this record. The transaction was rejected with an ERR-D message. The master
         record is printed for visibility so that the initiator of the transaction can determine if
         the input transaction completely duplicates this record or whether just the control data
         were duplicated.
REF-N    Denotes that production count has been recorded against this job order number and
         the JON master record does not reflect an induction.
REF-V    Denotes that a valid production transaction was processed and updated a JON Master
         Record by 244 transaction or 971.
P        Denotes PS/SD or PO/PTC on 237 not on validation table; C transaction flagged
         ERR-*; D and E transactions flagged “P”.
Z        Denotes a valid transaction processed against the Bill of Material/Labor Standard
         Master.

                    244 TRANSACTION/971 ERROR CODES (G004L-L2A)

Table A11.1. 244 Transaction/971 Error Codes
Code Error Code Description
 L       C      Purpose: This 244 transaction was rejected because its JON (control
                number/job designator/JON suffix) had been closed.
                Cause: The JON in the original 244 transaction may be wrong.
                Action: If the JON is wrong, obtain the scheduler’s suspense file copy of the
                rejected 244 transaction, correct JON (including CN/JD and suffix, and
                change the action suffix to PK. The document identified, document number,
                condition code, cost code, stock number, and quantity must be identical to
                these elements in the rejected 244 transaction. Input this correction to D035
                over an M/D remote.
 L       N      Purpose: This 244 transaction was rejected because the completion had
                already been reported against the serial number in the transaction.
                Cause: This condition was identified by the current serial number master
                showing JON is closed.
                Action: Research must be initiated to ensure the correct serial number and
                JON was reported. If the correct number was reported and the serial number
                was completed by the turn-in of this transaction, the MA G004L system
                monitor must be notified immediately to help resolve any problem resulting
                from the incorrect posting to the serial number master and the end item
                master.
  L         E       Purpose: This code indicates that some data element in the end item master
                    record is in error, and, therefore, this transaction was rejected. For reference
                    purposes, the data on the master record for this JON will also be printed as a
                    2 and ERR* reason code on the Daily End Item Production Account
                    Visibility and Cross-Reference Listing (G004L-L2A).
                    Cause: In most cases the FCRN or PCN is invalid.
                    Action: Call the workloader for assistance in correcting the master record.
                    When the record is corrected, reinput the rejected transaction with Action
                    suffix.
  L         J       Purpose: This 244 transaction rejected because its quantity would have made
                    the production issued exceeds the job order quantity.
                    Cause: Either the JON on the 244 transaction D7 issue transaction was
                    wrong or the original JOQ was wrong. Action:
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                             135


Code Error Code Description
                Action: If the JON was wrong, obtain the scheduler’s suspense file copy of
                the rejected 244 transaction, correct the JON, and change the action suffix to
                PK. The document identifier, stock number, quantity, condition code, and
                cost code must, be identical to the rejected transaction. Input the corrected
                244 transaction through D035 to G004L. A temporary JOQ can’t be
                increased once a job has a JON assigned. If the JOQ is wrong, process a 930
                with action 2 through the workloader to adjust the JOQ. After G004L-L2A is
                received by the scheduler to show that the correction processed, prepare and
                input a 244 transaction correction (action suffix PK) as above.
 L       K      Purpose: This 244 transaction rejected because the master record for this
                JON has a data processing code that doesn’t allow 244 transaction
                processing.
                Cause: Either the wrong JON was punched in the 244 transaction, or the
                wrong data processing code was put on the work authorization document
                when it was opened.
                     Action: If the JON was wrong, obtain the Scheduler’s suspense file copy of
                     the rejected 244 transaction, correct the JON, and change the action suffix to
                     PK. Input this corrected 244 transaction by an MA remote through D035K to
                     G004L. If the data processing code was wrong, submit 930 to change the
                     data processing code on the master record. When the scheduler receives
                     GO04L-L2A indicating that the data processing code has been changed,
                     prepare and submit a corrected 244 transaction (action suffix PK) as above.
  L         S        Purpose: This 244 transaction rejected because its stock number didn’t
                     match the stock number in the master file for this JON.
                     Cause: Either the wrong JON or stock number was reported on the WCD
                     item master record has the wrong stock number.
                     Action: If the JON was wrong, obtain the scheduler’s suspense file copy of
                     the rejected 244 transaction, correct the JON and change the action suffix to
                     PK. Make sure that the remaining data are not changed and input the
                     correction to G004L. If the end item master stock number is wrong, submit a
                     930 to change the stock number. After the scheduler receives the
                     G004L,-L2A indicating that the stock number has been changed, change the
                     action suffix to PK and input to G004L. However, if the stock number of the
                     244 transaction is incorrect (and the stock number in the end item master is
                     correct), notify the RIM about this error. They will have to process a reversal
                     for the incorrect stock number. The action suffix on these transactions won’t
                     be PK, but will agree with the original transaction. Since the original
                     transaction reject from G004L, the reversal must have a control number of
                     00000 so it will reject from G004L. When the reversal with control number
                     00000 appears as a reject, on the L2A, reinput the 244 transaction with the
                     correct stock number. Don’t use actions suffix PK.
136                                                                AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


Code Error Code Description
 L       U      Purpose: This 244 transaction rejected because the JON is not in the master
                file.
                Cause: Either the JON is wrong or the work authorization document hasn’t
                been opened.
                Action: If the JON was wrong, obtain the schedulers suspense file copy of
                the rejected 244 transaction, correct the JON and change the action suffix to
                PK. Make sure that none of the remaining data are changed, and input the
                corrected 244 transaction to G004L. If the work authorization document has
                not been opened, ask the planner to prepare a proper work authorization
                document to establish a master file record. After the receipt of G004L-L2A
                showing that the work authorization has been opened, change the action
                suffix on the scheduler’s suspense file copy to PK, and input the correction
                as above.
  L         W       Purpose: This 244 transaction turn-in rejected because its quantity exceeded
                    the 244 transaction OWO balance in the end item file master file.
                    Cause: The quantity on 244 transaction, the JON, or the 244 transaction
                    OWO balance was wrong.
                    Action: If the JON was wrong, obtain the scheduler’s suspense file copy of
                    the rejected 244 transaction, correct the JON, and change the action suffix to
                    PK. Make sure that none of the remaining data have been changed and input
                    the corrected 244 transaction to G004L. If the 244 transaction OWO balance
                    is in error, research the D035K/G004L, DD Form 1348-1 to find the issue
                    receipt acknowledgement or post-post issue that wasn’t processed to G004L.
                    Input the missing receipt acknowledgement or request that the RIM input the
                    post-post issue by Supply remote through D035K to end item production
                    segment of G004L. Then obtain the scheduler’s suspense file copy of the
                    rejected turn-in change the action suffix to PK and input it as above.
                    However, if the quantity on the rejected 244 transaction was wrong notify
                    the RIM of this error. They will have to process a reversal for the original
                    incorrect quantity and a correction for the correct quantity.
  L                 Purpose: This 244 transaction rejected because the JON is wrong.
                    Cause: Either the JON on the 244 transaction is quarterly or monthly and the
                    opposite type JON is already established or the 244 transaction has a
                    quarterly Jon and the EISP is $15,000 or more which requires a monthly
                    JON. Also it may be that the third position of the JON suffix doesn’t match
                    the ownership purpose (O/P) code on the 244 transaction.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                       137


Code Error Code Description
                Action: If the 244 transaction has a JON opposite of the, JON already
                established or the EISP is $15,000 or more requiring a monthly JON, obtain
                the scheduler’s suspense file of the rejected 244 transaction. Correct the JON
                and change the action suffix to PK. Input the corrected 244 transaction
                through D035K to G004L. If the O/P is correct on the 244 transaction and
                the last position of the JON suffix is wrong, obtain the scheduler's suspense
                file of the rejected 244 transaction. Correct the JON and change the action
                suffix to PK. Input the corrected 244 transaction through D035K to G004L.
                If the JON suffix is correct and the O/P is wrong, prepare a D6 with control
                number 00000, the wrong O/P, and corresponding JON suffix. Input the D6
                through D035K to G004L. Release the D6 deck and the material to supply.
                Reorder the asset using the correct O/P and JON. Notify RIM for assistance

                             JON SUFFIX EDIT FOR PERMANENT JONS
JON Suffix Edit for positive induction transactions (J/R and D7 transactions) against permanent JONs.
1. To prevent the induction of assets against a JON for a prior period, apply the following edits:
   a. If the JON suffix is all alpha or all numeric, the JON record must carry a DPC of 2 or 9 (serialized).
 The exception to this rule is when the suffix is all-numerical because a DMISA job is involved (reim-
bursement codes of G, H, I, or N and ownership purpose codes of 1, 4, or 5).
   b. Those transactions with alpha or numeric JON suffixes and DPC of 2 or 9 won’t have the suffix
edited. Those with numeric JON suffix and a reimbursement code of G, H, N, or I will have the fiscal year
and quarter edit applied as reflected below. Those transactions with an all-numerical suffix and other than
above will be rejected with "*" over the JON
      c. If the JON suffix is alphanumeric, the edits below are applied:
    If a monthly JON suffix has been established in a fiscal quarter, a quarterly JON suffix can’t be
established in the same fiscal quarter. If a quarterly JON suffix has been established in a fiscal quarter, a
monthly JON suffix can’t be established in the same fiscal quarter for the same end item.
     If the EISP is greater than or equal to $15,000, a monthly JON suffix must be used. If the EISP is
less than $15,000, a monthly or quarterly suffix may be used. Any transaction that fails these edits will be
rejected with "*" over the JON.

                      D035 SYSTEM EDITS AGAINST 244 TRANSACTIONS
1. Material Transactions. (Type trans code must not equal P).
   a. Permanent Control Numbers: Must match G004L on nine positions if JCC=A; six positions if
JCC=B.
        (1) D6 transaction: JON status code (JSC) must be 0, 1, Z or D.
        (2) D7 transaction: JSC must be 0 or 1.
    b. Temporary Control Numbers: Must match G004L on CN/JD.
        (1) D6 transactions: no edit on JSC.
        (2) D7 transactions: JSC must be 0 or 1. Edits do not apply to backorders.
Above edits do not apply to backorders.
2. Production Item Transactions. (Type Trans code is P and M for DF1.)
   a. Permanent JONs: Must match G004L on nine positions and JSC must not equal D.
        (1) All D6 or DF1 (+ or -).
        (2) D7 reversals.
    b. Permanent JONs: D7 positive transactions may match G004L on all nine positions.
        (1) If matched, JSC must not equal "D" or "1" and the transaction must pass the JON suffix edit
(Attachment 4).
        (2) If unmatched, must match on CN/JD and pass JON suffix edit. The JSC is not examined.
    c. Temporary JONs: Must match on CN/JD. The JSC will never be blank. A 125 must be input into
G004L so that JSC will become 0. Assets or material cannot be drawn out of supply until JSC is 0.
        JSC 0 is an active JON.
        JSC 1 is a completed JON.
        JSC D is a deleted JON.
        JSC Z is a canceled JON.
    d. Additive Production Item Edit. The transactions (D6) for production items will also be edited to
contain PS/SD in the organization identity field for cost codes P, F, H, or V (position 79). Transactions
without a nine in position 34 will cause an "F" coded reject.

G004L-D2X: Production Count Summary-RCC:
Specifications. The D2X is produced daily.
Contents. This report displays production count hours daily and month to date. It is summarized at RCC,
PS, Branch, Division, and MA level.
Purpose. This report gives the daily production count earned hours.
156                                                                   AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


G004L-E1A/E1B: Validation Stack:
Specifications. The Validation Stack is produced on paper (E1A) and on microfiche (E1B). Each table has
its own sequence and page break. Contents. The Validation Stack contains the following: RCC Table,
PCN/PON Table, FCRN Table, MDS Table, CAI Table, SAT, PAT, CAT, WTCT and Cost Class IV Table.
Purpose: RCC Table. The Resource Control (RCC), RCC Rate, and Production Section (PS) table shows
all allowable RCC/PS codes, and the officially approved RCC rates. The general purpose of this table is
to ensure various transactions are identified to legitimate maintenance accounting organizations (RCC/PS
codes) for proper costing/billing of all work performed by MA.
PCN/PON Table. The PCN validation table shows all the PCNs and PON combinations that are autho-
rized.
FCRN Table. The Funds Classification Reference Number (FCRN) validation table shows all authorized
FCRNs. MDS Table, the Mission, Designation, and Series Validation table shows all authorized MDS
entries for aircraft, missiles, engines, and gear boxes.
CAI Table. The Customer Account Identity (CAI) validation table contains all valid identities for cus-
tomer accounts, including major commands and codes for other services.
SAT. The Scheduler’s Address Table (SAT) shows PS/SD entries for all responsible schedulers and RCC/
FC entries that are authorized to submit production count. These PS/SD and RCC/FC entries also show
the name of responsible scheduler or the person responsibly for submitting production count, along with
number and location. A secondary purpose is to provide a directory of scheduling personnel to improve
communication among MA personnel and between customers and maintenance schedulers. Scheduling
personnel must review/update the SAT when there is a reorganization and when there are normal person-
nel changes through promotion/retirement, etc.
PAT. The Planner’s Address Table (PAT) shows Planning Organization/Planner Technician Code (PO/
PTC) entries for all planners. The general purpose of the PAT is to route various G004L products to the
responsible planner. A secondary purpose is to provide a directory of planners. Planning personnel must
review/update the PAT when there is a reorganization and when there are normal personnel changes
through promotion/retirement, etc.
CAT. The Customer’s Address Table (CAT) shows entries for all customers that request work by 206.
Each entry will also show the name of the contact individual, mailing symbol, phone number, building
number, and location. The last part also contains the Workloader Technician Codes (WTC).
CCIV Table. The Cost Class IV Table shows the owning and performing RCCs for each Cost Class IV
workorder. This table is used for reporting of earned hours related to duty code.
G004L-E3A: Mass Change Error List.
Specifications. These data are provided only when mass changes which contain invalid data are pro-
cessed, or the quantity exceeds table capability.
Purpose. This list provides visibility of change problems requiring immediate action to correct. Reorgani-
zation or redesignation of identity is the normal situation for use of mass changes. This necessitates valid
table or file establishment to enable the production reporting to be accomplished.
Action. Research the erroneous data, determine who is responsible for correction, and ensure the timely
submission of the proper transactions. The above will be coordinated with the appropriate organiza-
tion.(deleted second sentence)

Specifications. The Maintenance Earned Hour Analysis (F3A) product is an on-line/paper product. Con-
tents. The F3A report is a monthly summary of all earned hours processed through the G004L system
since the previous monthly cycle. Earned hours are computed by multiplying operations completed times
operations standard hours. Earned hours are categorized by permanent, temporary, type standard (E or
RCC and printed together with its percentage of the total earned hours for that RCC. A summary line for
each production section, branch, division, and directorate is also provided.
Purpose. The F3A provides production management and planners with labor standards application data
and volume of production by type of standard.
Action. Analyze present earned hours by type standard at all organizational levels to ensure adequate cov-
erage by engineered labor standards. Recommend corrective action to improve engineered standards cov-
erage in organizations where goals aren't met. Make sure the percent of earned hours for permanent
(planned) production remains relatively high. Provide summary data to higher headquarters as required.
G004L-F3B: Monthly Production Count Summary List:
Specifications. The Monthly Production Count Summary List (F3B) is produced at the end of the month.
It is listed in RCC, facility code (FC), JON, and operation number (ON) sequence. Contents. The F3B
report shows number of operations completed, operation standard hours and earned hours for each opera-
tion against which production count was processed through the G004L system during the previous month.
The earned hours are computed by multiplying the operations completed times the operation standard
hours. An earned hour total is also shown for each FC within an RCC, and for each RCC.
Purpose. Maintenance management uses the F3B report to determine RCC activity in terms of workload
done as compared to workload planned.
G004L-F3C: Cost Class 4 Man-Hour Summary by Performing RCC (Part 1); by Requesting Organiza-
tion (Part 2):
Specifications. Part 1 is sequenced by the performing RCC, JON, and by operation number. Part 2 is in
requesting production section, performing RCC, JON, and operation number sequence. Contents. The
F3C, parts 1 and 2, contains the BLC for Cost Class 4 items only, for each operation against which pro-
duction count was processed through the G004L system during the previous month. The BLC for each
operation is computed by multiplying the operations completed times the operation standard hours times
the RCC rate. In part 1, the BLC is also summarized and printed for each JON within RCC and for each
RCC, production section, branch, and division, with a grand total for the directorate. In part 2, the BLC is
also summarized and printed by each JON within performing RCC, within requesting production section,
branch, and division with a grand total for the directorate.
Purpose: The F3C report, part 1, is used by MAW and accounting to determine, by organization, the activ-
ity related to PME and other Cost Class 4 workload. This gives maintenance management a handle on the
cost of doing internal work. Cost Accounting uses this report in relation to the Monthly Production Count
Summary List (G004LF3B, described in Chapter 3 in determining the validity of what goes into Work in
Process (WIP) in the G072A system.
Part 1 of the F3C report will be used by maintenance management personnel to evaluate the action against
the planned performance (or the actual versus the budgeted) of Cost Class 4 work (work on mainte-
nance-owned equipment).

Part 2 of F3C report gives maintenance management information of what organizations requested PME
and other Cost Class 4 workload and allows for research and possible corrective action when requests
appear excessive.
Part 2 of the F3C report will be used by maintenance management personnel to prepare the planned labor
application (PLA) and the Operation Cost Base Budget (OCBB). Its secondary purpose is to display (and
thus help to control) the expenditure of maintenance resources on maintenance-owned equipment.
Action: Adjust budgeted and planned Cost Class 4 for performing RCCs and requesting RCCs. Sample
transactions to ensure valid production count was taken. Ensure labor standards are established for all
Cost Class 4 work. Ensure all Cost Class 4 work is costed to the requesting RCCs.

Cards (AFMC Form 956). G004L-G5C: Planning Backlog of Temporary Work Requests:
Specifications. The G5C is sequenced by PO/PTC, priority, delivery date, and request number, with a
page break by PO/PTC.
Contents. This report will show one line item for each B transaction that has processed validly, but hasn't
received a corresponding C transaction (237, header segment with the same production number). The
report will display all the data from 206, parts 1 and 2 if a full PO/PTC has been entered by the workloader
that data will be shown and it will be the primary sequence (major key) of the report. If the workloader
only entered the planning division, the G004L system will develop that into a temporary PO/PTC like
MA__EXX, where the planning division is substituted for the underscore (_). In this case, the appropriate
planner must enter his/her actual PO/PTC in the header segment of and produce a temporary job record
(G004L-L3A).
Purpose. This list identifies all Temporary Work Requests (s 206) that represent a backlog for individual
planners and the planning function as a whole. These data will also be printed in the sequence that the job
request should be processed; that is, priority, delivery date, and request number (within each PO/ PTC).
Action. This list is used by the planning unit supervisor and item planners to determine which request
should have the labor and material requirements planned next. It is provided as of the end of the week and
contains those requests that MAW has accepted and given control number assignment. The delivery date
and priority of the requirement are used to determine the ranking sequence. Data reflected from parts 1
and 2 of accepted, valid s 206 are listed for each request number. A Status of Planning Indicator (SOPI)
column has been added to the G004LG5C product. When the 237 is checked as incomplete by the planner,
an I will appear in the SOPI column. This record will remain on the G004LGSC until completed planning
action is submitted. A blank in the SOPI column will indicate no planning action has been taken.

Specifications. The G5G report is sequenced by PO, PTC, and JON, with a page break by PO/PTC. Con-
tents. Condition code G means reparable incomplete, and it is used when an end item cannot be made ser-
viceable due to a prolonged parts shortage. Condition Code H means condemnation. Both codes mean that
maintenance cannot be paid for the end item on straight job designators (including MISTR work with a
job designator).
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                           161


The G5G report will show data on completed JONs when the JON has had one or more turn-ins with a G
or H condition code.
The G5G report will also show the computed condemnation factor using the following formula: Condem-
nation Factor = (H Code Turn-Ins)/ (H Code Turn-Ins + JON Completions).
Purpose. The purpose of the G5G report is to display the G coded turn-ins for better control in mainte-
nance. This report will also aid the planner in developing a more accurate condemnation factor.
Action. The planner will use the computer developed condemnation factor to evaluate the adequacy of the
labor standards and update as required to ensure a breakeven position between cost and end item prices.
The workloading control technicians will use the G code data to determine the appropriate action required
to ensure a viable financial status for the end items. Negotiation with the IM and schedulers may be
desired to maintain asset availability and proper shop workloading. In some cases, sales for G code items
may be negotiated.

play a message indicating the type action taken. All invalid transactions will have the appropriate error
code displayed, and if applicable, will have * indicators placed over the field(s) in error. Each valid and
invalid transaction appearing on this report will trigger printing of the matching master record after all
transactions for the JONs have been processed. It will display erroneous transactions generated, 930 trans-
action action codes 2, 3, 6, 7 or 8 (card code H), and interrogation transactions (card code T) which were
submitted for processing against the master record. Each line on the report will display the reason for
printing the entry. CHG will prefix the reason on those entries printed because a data overlay (930 H
transaction), or a PS/SD/PO/PTC mass change has been processed against the master record. This entry
displays the JON master record as it appears after the valid processing and update of the record. The fields
that were changed on the record will be flagged by a # for facilitating verification of the change action.
ERR will prefix the reason for erroneous entries, either a master record of an H or T type transaction
which was to have been processed against the JON master. Purpose. To provide schedulers visibility of all
valid and invalid transactions that affect production items for which they are responsible.G004L-L2B:

tray all valid/invalid transactions from 237 and 600D transactions, 930 transaction changes, and Part II of
206. Likewise; the L3B report is produced as a result of the annual input of the FCRN mass change action
to the PJM record by ACFCM, Maintenance Cost Accounting, and the daily match of the PCN in the mas-
ter JON record against the PCN table in the validation stack in G004L.
Contents. This report is structured with three tiers of data. One tier reflects 237 header and 600D transac-
tion additions as well as 930 transaction changes to these data. The second and third tiers will contain
LSM and BOM transactions input by 237 as well as 930 transaction changes to these data.
Purpose. The listing provides the planner a printout of all transactions rejected or processed resulting from
processing of 237, 600D or 930 transactions. For permanent JONs, the listing tells the planner that labor
and material standards can now be submitted. If the L3B is produced as a result of the annual FCRN mass
change action, it will inform record under his/ her jurisdiction for the subsequent year. However, process-
ing the input document could produce an error message. If the PCN in the JON master record isn't on the
validation stack during the daily match, an error message will be reflected for the PCN on the L3B prod-
uct.
Action. The planner must correctly input errors by pulling the suspense copy of the input data and verify-
ing the entry on the list as being what should be contained; that is, rate, serial number, JON, EII, DPC, etc.
If an FCRN change is reflected, this is for information only. No action is required. If an FCRN error is
reflected as a result of the mass change action by ACFCM, contact workloading personnel for corrective
action. If a PCN error is reflected as a result of the daily mechanical match and the JON record is required,
contact MAWW for reentry of the PCN to the validation stack. If the production number isn't required,
164                                                                  AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


initiate deletion action on the permanent production number, immediate corrective action is required.
Errors in data fields affecting EISP can result in an erroneous computation by the G004L system. This
incomplete data will be forwarded to the customer by the G004L-L3C product. To avoid this, the planner
should input the initial 237 and addenda with the incomplete planning status block checked, until the
planner is sure all entries are valid. Planning completed can then be input with an additional addendum.

Supporting Systems and Functions.
D012 - Make IT–Management Planning and Control System. The Technology and Industrial Support
Directorate at WR-ALC is using D012 to provide the following functions: Quote/Order Processing * Pro-
cessing Planning * Bill of Materials * Shop Floor Control (Labor Tracking, Quality) * Resources Control
(Inventory, Shipping) D012 is not used by the Air Force (3 sites), Navy (1 site), and Private Industry.
D035K - AFMC Retail Stock Control and Distribution (SC & D) Central Material Location. The AFMC
Retail SC & D system is designed to improve materiel management and customer support through stan-
dardization of distribution decisions and depot processes and provide rapid and positive response to logis-
tics demands.
D046 - Base Account Screening Exercise System Interrogations. The D046 interrogation process is
designed to provide an interrogation capability by stock number and by Federal supply class manufacturer
(FSCM)/reference number for data maintained in:
       (1) The Master Item Identification Control System (D043),
       (2) The Interchangeability and Substitution Data Maintenance System (D097),
       (3) Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) files when the NSN or FSCM/reference number is
not resident in the D043 system and with selected option codes,
       (4) the Base Account Screening Exercise System (D046), and
      ( 5 ) The Stock Number User Directory (SNUD) System (D071). It affords a means of obtaining
current stock number related management data on a five-day-a-week basis and current FSCM/reference
number related data and SNUD user registration data once a week.
D071 - Stock Number User Directory (SNUD). The SNUD is an AFMC-operated data system which pro-
vides selective automatic distribution of stock number oriented management data. It is a means of associ-
ating stock numbers with stock record account numbers (SRANs) or assigned user account numbers to
provide tailored automatic distribution of management data to meet the individual needs of each user reg-
istered in SNUD. This tailoring is based on user established interest in a specific stock number and type
of management data registration established by the user, with selection of required transactions being
accomplished electronically by SNUD. The need for manual research of reference documents, such as,
stocklists, machine listings, etc, to keep base records current has been minimized.
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                                 169


D087X – Execution and Prioritization of Repairs Support System (EXPRESS). EXPRESS, an automated
tool to support Pacer Lean and the Depot Repair Enhancement Program (DREP) performs the following
functions: Prioritization of Aircraft Reparables (PARS); Express Prioritization Processor (EPP) and the
supportability module. EXPRESS provides a single integrated priority list of all repair requirements. At
an ALC, determines the ability of existing resources to support repair actions and provides the data and
the mechanism to move item into repair. The source of repair/supply uses a mathematical model in PARS
to prioritize repair and distribution of assets to the users from the source of the Consolidated Serviceable
Inventory (CSI). PARS take into account base flying activity, asset position, and the corporately estab-
lished aircraft availability goals. EPP sets priorities for the repair of items which are not addressed in
PARS and combines all priorities into a single integrated list for each repair shop. Assets which do not
have aircraft availability goals are prioritized using Deepest Hole logic to try to fill the most critical need.
EPP also provides the prioritized list to the distribution module, which identifies propositioning actions
for serviceable parts as they come out of repair. The supportability module takes the prioritized repair list
form the EPP and determines whether the required items can be repaired based on four evaluation criteria:
Carcass availability, repair parts availability; repair funds availability and repair resources availability.
Items which meet all of these criteria are entered onto the D035K EXPRESS table for transfer to the shop.
Items which fail one or more of these criteria are identified to Shop PRO, where workload managers can
resolve supportability constraints.
D143B - Central Edit, Index and Routing Subsystem. The D143B system is a key feature of the Air Force
recoverable assembly management system (AFRAMS). It is designed to provide all using systems with
current and consistent management data for all stock numbers for which the ALC has AF item manage-
ment (wholesale) responsibility (D032, Stock Control and Distribution System (SC&D)) and all stock
numbers applicable to the local special support system (D034A). The D1438 subsystem verifies SRANs
and routes incoming products to appropriate data systems and ALCs.
D143C – Air force/Federal Logistics information system (FLIS) edit and routing system (AFERS). Pro-
vides the Air Logistics Center (ALC) with a single source for the input and routing of material identifica-
tion data destined for AIR Force, Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) and other services or
agencies and cataloging systems participating in the Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS). DLSC/
FLIS is also a source of input transaction to D143C. D143C has one job that runs at all 3 ALC'S to handle
the D143C Keyplus input. All other batch jobs, including all interface processing, run only at WPAFB,
Monday through Friday.
ADDED
D200 – Requirement Data Bank. The Requirements Data Bank (RDB) system comprises a set of major
logistics processes and models integrated by a large relational database. RDB automates and integrates
the Air Force Material requirements determination process which computes procurement and repair
requirements for spares, repair parts, and major equipment items. RDB uses a planning period of 38 quar-
ters and recomputes quarterly. The relational database is the repository of detailed information showing
the indentured application of every individual part of each particular aircraft type or end item. Within this
structure the system holds the historical and planning data needed to support computation of quantities for
buy and repair. The data includes: Past and projected weapon system operating programs, future readiness
goals, maintenance and modification schedules, item failure rates and condemnations. Data query, model-
ing, and management report generation are on-line.
E046B - Labor Standard Mechanization System. The E046B system provides the capability to set up and
maintain labor standard for the Directorate of Maintenance within the Air Force Logistics Command.
170                                                                  AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


G004B - Project Order Control System. The G004B system maintains the project order register and dis-
plays the status of every project order validated and accepted by the Directorate of Maintenance. It also
provides financial reports to help accounting to get an adequate cash flow to operate each ALC.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II this system is obsolete.
G004C - Workload Programming, Planning and Control. The G004C system reflects the capability of the
M/D to perform all assigned workloads. This effort is supported by AFMC/MASE and the M/D Resource
Management Division (MAW) and Maintenance Industrial Fund Cost Section (ACFCI) at the various
ALCs. The primary effort within MAW is the planning of depot level maintenance workloads to effi-
ciently use available resources while satisfying the needs of its customers, the Directorate of Materiel
Management and other M/D customers. This effort supports the M/D customer negotiations process and
allows a determination as to which of the stated workload requirements can be supported by the M/D.
This system provides the mechanized data in which the workload and resource posture is portrayed for the
current plus 4 years.
G004H - Maintenance Actual Material Cost System. The G004H system provides structured information
for the effective and economical management of material applied in end item production and its cost dur-
ing the day-to-day business of depot level maintenance. G004H serves as a collection, validation, and
redistribution point for daily transactions. Valid material transactions are accumulated for each calendar
month. A history file containing the complete history from inception through the current date of all active
production numbers is maintained from which interrogation reports may be produced. Reconciliation
Reports provide information necessary to reconcile distribution of material costs with billing documents
and material issues.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II this system is obsolete.
G004L – Job Order Production Master. Provides the basis for job order costing by end item identity. The
system accounts for end items input to work, accumulates hours earned during the repair process, outputs
these hours to other data systems for computation of effectiveness, creates work-in-process records and
accumulates production units completed for output to G072A at the job order level which results in reve-
nue to offset costs incurred. The system provides many data products for use at different levels of man-
agement. These products track production and show earned hours.
Note : Under DMAPS Phase II the G072A is obsolete.
G005M - Depot Maintenance Material Support System. The G005M system is used to store, update and
retrieve data on standard Bills of Material, developed by M/D material planning technicians, in direct sup-
port of items repaired by the Directorate of Maintenance.
G019C - MISTR Requirements, Schedules, and Analysis. (MISTR = Management of Items Subject to
Repair). The purpose of the G019C system is to provide the item manager and SOR ALCs with manage-
ment information needed to respond to the short repair turnaround time required by the depot repair cycle.
The system is used to schedule items for repair and monitor.
G020 – To provide maintenance with scheduling and analysis data on reparable items.
G029 – Depot Maintenance Strategic Management System (DMSMS). The concept of the Depot Mainte-
nance Strategic Management System came about as the result of posture planning needs to analyze pos-
turing data in a more detailed timely manner. The major performance goal of the DMSMS (G029) is to
provide users a comprehensive mechanized analysis tool for major effective and economical management
of Depot Level Maintenance (DLM) resources. The DMSM will provide the following: Peacetime mis-
AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004                                                                               171


sion requirements (Workload analysis) * Personnel data (Personnel analysis) * Capacity Data (Capacity
analysis) *Resources Control Center/Requirements Distr. (RCC analysis) *Analysis Data and Reports
*Capability to develop AD HOC programs/reports. This system allows users to make online data entries
to provide the posturing capability required to meet DoDD 4151.15 Requirements. The DMSMS was
written at SA-ALC, underwent revision and enhancement at OC-ALC, and was standardized for Com-
mand release at OO-ALC.
G035A - Depot Maintenance Industrial Fund (DMS, DMAG) Financial Procedures. The Depot Mainte-
nance Industrial Fund Financial Procedures provides budget and cost information for organic DMAG
internal management. The G035 system obtains materials costs from G004H and labor costs from G037G
and other direct costs from G072A. ACFC manually inputs some overhead costs. The system first segre-
gates costs into direct and overhead. The compiled overhead costs are distributed to supported production
RCCs and provide to G072A. Cost class 4 costs are also distributed to owning RCCs in the G035A sys-
tem.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II the G072A and G037G will be obsolete.
G037E - MDS/Project Workload Planning S stem. The G037E system is used by management to Plan,
schedule, and control the modification and repair of aircraft and other type workloads that can success-
fully use the system.
G037G - Maintenance Labor Distribution and Cost System. The labor distribution system produces actual
labor data for: (1) Daily actual labor utilization reports, (2) Daily and cumulative month-to-date labor
summary and effectiveness reports, (3) Monthly cost reports, and (4) Daily projection of labor available
to support product division shops workload. A monthly summary of detailed employees actual labor
hours is distributed to supplemental accounts (duty codes) and to shredouts thereof, when necessary each
day. Cumulative month-to-date/year-to-date totals are maintained and accelerated labor rates are applied
to the cumulative monthly totals of on duty hours to compute actual labor costs.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II this system is obsolete.
G072A - Depot Maintenance Production Cost System. The G072A system computes planned end item
repair costs, computes sales billing values for completed job orders, collects costs, and man-hours
expended on job orders, and builds information for maintenance managers to use in judging operating
efficiency and financial performance by combining parts from each of the above. This includes figuring
profit/loss.
NOTE: Under DMAPS Phase II this system is obsolete.
G097 – Programmed Depot Maintenance Scheduling System (PDMSS). The USAF standard project
management information system, which facilitates planning, tracking, scheduling and execution, and per-
formance measurement activities for programmed/unprogrammed Depot Maintenance Workload at Air
Logistics Centers (ALCs). The defense depot maintenance council Joint Policy Coordinating
Group-Depot Maintenance (JPCG-DM) requirements supported by PDMSS include: Facilitate workflow
scheduling by operation and major job, optimize resource allocation, manage capacity and labor utiliza-
tion more effectively, facilitate competitive positing, and strengthen performance measurement visibility.
G336 – Maintenance Workload Management System (MWMS). Provides personnel in the Production
Directorates the capability to establish and file maintain both the permanent workload requirements mas-
ter records and the temporary work authorization records necessary to validate and authorize the accom-
plishment of workloads. IT also provides capability to electronically initiate, coordinate, and track current
172                                                                  AFMCI21-156 25 AUGUST 2004


quarter renegotiations and quarterly negotiations. In addition IT provides the capability to electronically
initiate planning documents and file maintain existing planning data. Each of these transactions can be
electronically transferred from one ALC to another along with data retrieval and data updates. MWMS
was designed, written, and implemented by the systems prototype laboratory at OO-ALC.
G337 – Inventory Tracking System (ITS). Tracks repairable end items form time of induction to time of
turn-in. IT assigns item tracking number to all parts as they come in and subsequently tracks them through
disassembly, repair, and assembly. The system provides management information to all levels of manage-
ment and provides inventory control. G337 legacy will be decommissioned upon full implementation of
the G337 technical refresh (FY04).
