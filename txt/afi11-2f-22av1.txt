       1.2.4.2. Attach Aircrew Position Indicator (API) -6/8 flyers to a flying squadron.
       1.2.4.3. Except when otherwise mandated, designate the training level to which each API – 6 (Air
       National Guard (ANG): all flyers) will train. Upon request provide ACC/A3T (ANG: HQ ACC/
       A3G) with a list of Basic Mission Capable (BMC) and Combat Mission Ready (CMR) manning
       positions. Review programs and manning position designations annually.
       1.2.4.4. Forward supplements of this volume and Wing syllabi to ACC/A3T for review each train-
       ing cycle, or upon significant changes (ANG: to ACC/A3G, upon request). Review supplements
       each training cycle .
6                                                                       AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006


    1.2.5. SQ/supervision (ANG: Appropriate operations supervisor) will:
       1.2.5.1. Ensure adequate continuity and supervision of individual training needs, experience, and
       proficiencies of assigned/attached pilots.
       1.2.5.2. Ensure review of training and evaluation records of newly-assigned pilots and those com-
       pleting formal training, to determine the training required for them to achieve BMC or CMR and
       to ensure provisions of this volume have been met.
       1.2.5.3. Ensure Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) missions are oriented to developing basic combat
       skills, or practicing tactical employment simulating conditions anticipated in the unit mission.
       Provide guidance to ensure only effective RAP missions are logged as RAP sorties. See Attach-
       ment 2 for RAP mission definitions.
       1.2.5.4. Determine missions/events in which individual BMC pilots will maintain qualification
       versus familiarization.
       1.2.5.5. Determine utilization of BMC pilots.
       1.2.5.6. Determine how many and which BMC and CMR pilots will carry special capabilities/
       qualifications.
       1.2.5.7. Identify the levels of supervision required to accomplish the required training, unless spe-
       cifically directed.
       1.2.5.8. Determine program for supervisory review of armament recordings.
       1.2.5.9. Assist the wing/group in developing the unit training programs.
       1.2.5.10. Monitor individual assigned/attached pilot currencies and requirements.
       1.2.5.11. Ensure pilots only participate in sorties, events, and tasks for which they are adequately
       prepared, trained, and current.
       1.2.5.12. ACC squadrons will submit a training report to HQ ACC/A3TO (ANG: ACC/A3G)
       every 4th month during the training cycle (always at the end of Jan, May, Sep for all). Squadrons
       may submit an out of cycle report at anytime if Higher Headquarters (HHQ) assistance is required
       to prepare for Designed Operational Capability (DOC) or AEF tasking. Reports will consist of: 1)
       an email memo summarizing results or unresolved issues since the last report, current training
       plan summary, and significant shortfalls/Limiting Factors (LIMFACS) affecting training. 2) a
       filled out squadron training health slide (attachment to email memo) summarizing critical training
       issues. Both items IAW the guidance and examples at the web site https://do.acc.af.mil/dot/
       DOTO/Fighter/FighterTeam.asp . Reports will reflect on different phases of training unique to
       each AEF pair. Key reports are the Post-AEF (end of the 1st month after AEF Vulnerability (Vul)
       period) and the Pre-AEF 4 months prior to AEF Vul period, others are snapshots of a squadron’s
       training health. Report only significant shortfalls/LIMFACS of events/sorties that affect 15% or
       greater of the squadron’s crew force. Include possible solutions or specific assistance required if
       able. HQ ACC will attempt to rectify or minimize noted shortfalls/LIMFACS while the training
       cycle is under way.
           1.2.5.12.1. Shortfalls occur when required mission training tasks are not accomplished due to
           shortages of equipment, munitions, etc. Example: unable to accomplish actual weapons
           release due to a shortage of training weapons.
AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006                                                                                7


           1.2.5.12.2. LIMFACS are factors, constraints, restrictions, etc. that degrade training effective-
           ness. Example: squadron's ability to accomplish actual weapons release is limited due to the
           lack of ranges that allow aircraft to drop munitions. This may include support hardware and

       all changes.

1.4. Training.
Pilot training is designed to progress a pilot from Initial Qualification Training (IQT) (B Course or Tran-
sition/Re-Qualification Training (TX)), then to Mission Qualification Training (MQT), and finally to
Continuation Training (CT).
   1.4.1. IQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify pilots in a basic position and flying
   duties without regard to a unit's mission. Upon completion of IQT, the pilots attain Basic Aircraft
   Qualification (BAQ) status. BAQ is a prerequisite for MQT. Except for General Officers above the
8                                                                       AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006


    wing level, BAQ is not a long-term qualification status. Waiver authority for any pilot, other than gen-
    eral officers above the wing level, to remain BAQ is MAJCOM A3 (ANG: ACC/A3G).
    1.4.2. MQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify or re-qualify pilots in a specific posi-
    tion and flying duties to perform the missions assigned to a specific unit. Pilots maintain BAQ status
    until they complete MQT. Completion of MQT or formal training unit (FTU) instructor course is a
    pre-requisite for BMC and completion of MQT is a pre-requisite for CMR.
    1.4.3. CT. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of pilot training in the basic flying skills
    contained in Table 4.2. These skills (Non-RAP requirements) ensure safe operation of the aircraft.
    The second consists of specific mission-related training required to accomplish the unit's assigned
    missions.
    1.4.4. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) is the CT program designed to focus training on capabilities
    needed to accomplish a unit's core tasked missions. Following completion of IQT and MQT, pilots
    will have received training in all the basic missions of a specific unit, unless excepted in Chapter 3.
    Pilots will then be assigned to either a Combat Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable
    (BMC) position.
       1.4.4.1. CMR. The minimum training required for pilots to be qualified and proficient in all of
       the primary missions tasked to their assigned combat unit and weapons system.
       1.4.4.2. All designated combat aircraft (CC-coded) unit active duty API -1 positions, flying SQ/
       CC and SQ/DO positions are designated CMR positions. OG/CCs may designate other API -6
       positions not assigned to the flying squadron as CMR. (EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned,
       the SQ/CC may elect to train the front line of their Unit Manning Document (UMD) API -1s to
       CMR and designate the overage BMC. In this case, priority should be given to inexperienced
       pilots with at least 50%, if available, designated CMR.) For ANG: Any pilot may be designated
       CMR or BMC at OG/CC discretion. CMR pilots maintain proficiency and qualification in all core
       missions of the flying unit to which they are assigned or attached. CMR pilots maintain currencies
       which affect CMR status, accomplish all core designated flight training (sorties and events), and
       all mission ground training. Failure to complete this training or maintain these currencies results in
       regression to Non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived by appropriate authority. While N-CMR,
       pilots may perform missions (including exercises and contingencies) and events in which they are
       current and qualified at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
       1.4.4.3. BMC. The minimum training required for pilots to be familiarized in all, and may be
       qualified and proficient in some of the primary missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapons
       system.
       1.4.4.4. All active duty wing pilot positions that are not designated CMR positions, are BMC
       positions. BMC designations are assigned to pilots who have a primary job performing wing
       supervision or staff functions that directly support the flying operation, or are FTU instructors, or
       operational test pilots. However, these pilots are required to provide additional sortie generation
       capability, either in lieu of or in addition to, the personnel assigned to the flying squadrons. BMC
       pilots maintain familiarization with all unit core missions. They may also maintain proficiency
       and qualification in some of the unit core missions. For those missions in which they maintain
       familiarization only, BMC pilots must be able to attain proficiency and qualification in 30 days or
       less. BMC pilots accomplish all mission related ground training designated by their attached SQ/
       CC. BMC pilots may deploy and may participate in any mission for which they are proficient and
AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006                                                                                9


      qualified, without additional training, as determined by the SQ/CC. Failure to complete BMC
      required training results in regression to non-BMC (N-BMC) status. While N-BMC, SQ/CC will
      determine missions the pilots may perform and supervision required.
      1.4.4.5. N-CMR/N-BMC. Pilots that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status will accomplish the
      requirements in accordance with paragraph 4.7.
      1.4.4.6. Specialized Training. Specialized training is training in any special skills necessary to
      carry out the unit's assigned mission that is not required by every pilot. Specialized training con-
      sists of upgrade training such as flight lead upgrade (FLUG), instructor pilot upgrade (IPUG), etc.,
      as well as CT to maintain proficiency and qualification in unit tasked special capabilities and mis-
      sions. Specialized training is normally accomplished after a pilot is assigned CMR/BMC status;
      and is normally in addition to CMR/BMC requirements. Unless otherwise specified, pilots in
      CMR or BMC positions may hold special capabilities/qualifications as long as any additional
      training requirements are accomplished.

1.5. Training Concepts and Policies:
   1.5.1. Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness consis-
   tent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for realism against the
   expected threat, pilot capabilities, and safety. This volume provides training guidelines and policies
   for use with operational procedures specified in applicable flying/operations publications.
   1.5.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (ACC TRSS) will develop and validate training programs
   when/where tasked by the HQ ACC/A3. Other MAJCOMs may submit requests for training program
   support to the HQ ACC/A3. If validated, these requests will be prioritized and tasked to ACC TRSS.
   Designated test units (CB-coded) may develop syllabi to upgrade Operational Test Pilots in support of
   specific test plans. These syllabi will be approved by the OG/CC and submitted to ACC TRSS.
   1.5.3. Design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron tasked roles, maintain pro-
   ficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RAP training missions should emphasize
   either basic combat skills, or scenarios that reflect procedures and operations based on employment
   plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition capabilities. Use of procedures and actions appli-
   cable to combat scenarios are desired (e.g., appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures,
   combat tactics, safe recovery procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, Intel
   briefing/debriefing). Tactical training will include use of inert and live ordnance, threat simulators,
   countermeasures, and dissimilar aircraft as much as possible.
   1.5.4. In-flight Supervision:
      1.5.4.1. Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervision necessary to
      accomplish the required training. If the mission objectives include introduction to tasks or instruc-
      tion to correct previous discrepancies, then an instructor pilot (IP) may be required.
      1.5.4.2. IPs and flight lead (FL)-qualified Squadron (SQ) supervisors may allow any pilot to lead
      limited portions of a mission if they are appropriately briefed. This provision will only be used to
      allow the pilot to practice events in which the pilot is already qualified or to help determine if the
      pilot is ready for FLUG. In either case, the IP or SQ supervisor is responsible for the flight.
10                                                                       AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006


        1.5.4.3. Flight leads may give their wingman the tactical lead for specific tasks. As the tactical
        lead, the wingman makes tactical decisions for the flight, but the flight lead retains overall author-
        ity and responsibility.

1.6. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Policy and Management:
     1.6.1. The RAP training cycle is equal in length to the AEF cycle. RAP tasking is aligned with a
     squadron’s specific AEF pair and executed IAW RAP tasking memo. If not assigned to an AEF pair,
     or assigned to multiple AEF pairs, RAP tasking is aligned to the AEF cycle itself. Each RAP qualifi-
     cation level is defined by a total number of RAP sorties, broken down into mission types, plus specific
     weapons qualifications and associated events as determined by the MAJCOM and unit commanders.
     1.6.2. The total number of RAP sorties for a qualification level is the primary factor for maintaining
     an individual's qualification level. The breakout of sortie/mission types is provided as a guideline to
     be followed as closely as possible but minor variances (other than Red Air allocations) are authorized.
     Variations in sortie/mission types may be used as a basis for regression by the SQ/CC. Qualification in
     a mission is determined by the SQ/CC considering the MAJCOM guidance and the individual's capa-
     bilities.
     1.6.3. An effective RAP training sortie requires accomplishing a tactical mission profile or a building
     block type sortie. Each profile or sortie requires successfully completing a significant portion of the
     events applicable to that sortie type, as determined by the SQ/CC and Attachment 2.
     1.6.4. The SQ/CC's first priority should be to train all designated pilots to CMR.
     1.6.5. Progression from BMC to CMR requires:
        1.6.5.1. A 1-month look back at the higher sortie rate.
        1.6.5.2. Qualification in all core missions, and weapons events required at CMR.
        1.6.5.3. Confirmation that the progressed pilot can complete the prorated number of sortie/event
        requirements remaining at CMR by the end of the training cycle.
        1.6.5.4. Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification or certi-
        fication.
        1.6.5.5. Squadron CC certification.
     1.6.6. SQ/CCs will determine and assign pilots that will train for and maintain special capabilities or
     qualifications. Specialized training is normally accomplished in addition to baseline CMR/BMC sor-
     tie/event requirements; except for mission commander and flight lead training.
     1.6.7. Wing CMR and BMC pilots will fly the required monthly sortie rate. If unable, refer to Regres-
     sion, paragraph 4.7.
     1.6.8. End of Cycle training requirements are based on the pilot's experience level on the last day of
     the current training cycle.
     1.6.9. Units converting to another mission-design-series (MDS) may fly pilots in CMR positions at
     the BMC rate until one month prior to the operationally ready date if the CMR sortie rates cannot be
     supported. CMR pilots should be flown at a CMR rate for the month prior to initial operational capa-
     bility (IOC). Active duty wings converting to new MDS are authorized one SQ equivalent (7/6 for 24/
     18 or less Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI)) of additional API-6’s during the conversion period. How-
AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006                                                                                  11


   ever, total wing staff flying the new aircraft shall not exceed total authorized for final conversion equi-
   page.

1.7. Training Sortie Program Development:
   1.7.1. RAP mission/sortie and event requirements (see Attachment 2 for definitions) apply to CMR
   and BMC pilots as well as those carrying special capabilities or qualifications and are IAW the RAP
   tasking memo . The standard sortie requirements at Table 1.1. establish the minimum number of sor-
   ties per training cycle for BMC and CMR levels of training. The RAP tasking memo takes precedence
   over this volume, and may contain an updated sortie requirement or missions/events not yet incorpo-
   rated in Attachment 2.
   1.7.2. Non-RAP requirements (Instrument) are in addition to RAP requirements. These sorties ensure
   basic pilot skills are maintained (see Table 4.2.). All active duty units are also allocated Navigation
   sorties for their API -1 pilots. These sorties ensure that pilots maintain their skills necessary to operate
   safely in the civil airspace environment.
   1.7.3. Experiencing/Collateral sortie requirements must be considered when developing unit flying
   hour programs.
      1.7.3.1. Experiencing sorties are additional training sorties necessary to achieve desired profi-
      ciency in optimum time. RAP sorties may not provide sufficient hours to experience pilots to
      achieve overall unit experience levels. The USAF sets a required number of hours to experience
      pilots and a percentage goal of the unit pilots that should meet these requirements.
      1.7.3.2. Collateral sorties are not directly related to combat employment training but are neces-
      sary in day to day unit operations. These include but are not limited to functional check flights,
      ferry flights, deployments, and air shows. For the training cycle, the MAJCOM allocates a block
      of sorties to the unit for these purposes.
   1.7.4. Unit flying hour programs are allocated a number of attrition sorties that compensate for
   non-effective training sorties. Non-effective sorties are logged when a training sortie, RAP or
   Non-RAP, is planned, but a major portion of valid training for that type of mission is not accomplished
   due to poor weather, air aborts, etc. In order to accurately allocate the number of attrition sorties, it is
   essential that non-effective sorties are logged appropriately.

1.8. Training Records and Reports:
     1.8.1. Units will maintain pilot records for individual training and evaluations IAW:
        1.8.1.1. AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training
        1.8.1.2. AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program
        1.8.1.3. AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
     1.8.2. Track the following information for all pilots (as applicable):
        1.8.2.1. Ground training.
        1.8.2.2. Requirements and accomplishment of individual sorties, RAP sorties, sortie types, and
        events cumulatively for the training cycle.
        1.8.2.3. RAP sortie requirements and accomplishment using 1-month and 3-month running totals
        for look-back.
     1.8.3. Currencies:
        1.8.3.1. Weapons employment records in sufficient detail to document all employment attempts.
     1.8.4. Units may fill in ARMS with either the date of the last FTU or United States Air Force Weap-
     ons School (USAFWS) equivalent training accomplished, or the unit mission certification date.

1.9. Armament Recording:
     1.9.1. Pilots will use and assess all available training documentation such as air combat maneuvering
     instrumentation (ACMI), and Digital Video Recorder (DVR) data on all tactical missions. Pilots will
     review their own data with their flight/element member(s).
     1.9.2. As a guide, the following DVR items should be reviewed: titling, weapons parameters, trigger
     check, identification procedures, adherence to Training Rules (TR), communications procedures and
     discipline, flight discipline, proper Anti-G Straining Maneuver IAW para 6.4.2.5., tactical employ-
     ment, and instrument approaches.

1.10. Pilot Utilization Policy:
     1.10.1. Commanders (CCs) will ensure wing/group tactical pilots (API -1/6s) fill authorized positions
     IAW unit manning documents and that pilot status is properly designated. The overall objective is that
     pilots perform combat-related duties. Supervisors may assign pilots to valid, short-term tasks (escort
     officer, flight evaluation board (FEB)/mishap board member, etc.), but must continually weigh the
     factors involved, such as level of pilot tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience. For inex-
     perienced pilots in the first year of their initial operational assignment, supervisors will limit the
     non-flying duties to those related to combat activities.
     1.10.2. Duties required by various publications that may be assigned to CAF API -1 pilots are weap-
     ons and tactics officer, programmer, flying safety officer, supervisor of flying (SOF), mobility/ contin-
     gency plans, training (except ARMS documentation), SQ Standardization/Evaluation Liaison Officer
     (SELO), squadron life support officer, electronic combat officer, and other duties directly related to
     flying operations (runway operations monitor [ROM], range control officer [RCO], etc.). In some
     instances, such as squadron-assigned flying safety officers, API -1s may be attached to the wing. API
     -1s will not be attached to wing staffs or man wing staff positions unless total wing pilot API -1 man-
AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006                                                                            13


   ning is 100 percent or better. CCs will ensure wing staff pilots (API -6s) perform duties justified in
   manpower standards documents and authorized in UMDs.

1.11. Sortie Allocation Guidance:
   1.11.1. Inexperienced API -1 pilots should receive sortie allocation priority over experienced pilots.
   Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows:
      1.11.1.1. Formal Training Units and USAFWS. Formal syllabus training, Instructor Upgrade,
      Instructor CT, authorized staff personnel not performing Instructor or Flight Examiner (FE) duties
      1.11.1.2. Operational Units. CMR API -1, MQT API -1, CMR API -6, MQT API -6, and BMC.
      1.11.1.3. Test and Test Evaluation Squadron (TES) Units. Requirements directed by MAJ-
      COM, training required to prepare for assigned projects/tasking, BMC training requirements that
      cannot be accomplished on primary missions.
   1.11.2. Wing API -6 authorizations are IAW unit manning documents.
   1.11.3. For FTU only wings, all API -6 pilots will maintain instructor status (optional for WG/ OG
   CC, functional check flight (FCF) pilots, and one other). These wings will fly API -1/6 pilots as
   required by programmed flying training (PFT).
   1.11.4. API-8 rated personnel flying authorizations, ACC/IGS inspectors in API-6 billets, and Test
   Unit aircrews will be IAW AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM guidance. API-8 pilots will fly the BMC sortie
   rate, however they are not required to complete BMC specific missions/events or meet monthly look-
   back requirements. Test unit pilots will fly the BMC sorite rate as a minimum and should meet montly
   BMC lookback. SQ/CCs will direct additional sorties if syllabus or test missions provide insufficient
   pilot proficiency training. Units should provide assigned API 6/8 flyers adequate resources to main-
   tain minimum training requirements. However, API-6 flyer support will not come at the expense of
   the flying squadron's primary mission. API 6 flyers will accomplish non-RAP requirements with
   allotted BMC sorties. API-8/ACC IGS flyers will strive to accomplish non-RAP requirements with
   allotted BMC sorties. If attached units cannot meet attached flyer requirements, they must request
   relief IAW AFI 11-401, as supplemented. Units requiring flying hour adjustments for attached API-8
   and applicable API-6 flyers must request program changes IAW MAJCOM directives.
   1.11.5. (ANG: N/A) There is no maximum sortie requirement for CMR pilots. Table 1.2. defines the
   maximum sortie requirements for other pilots per training cycle. On occasion, unique operations may
   require pilots to fly more than the maximum number of sorties authorized, however, this may impact
   training of other pilots.
   1.11.6. Aircrew assigned or attached to ACC/IGS as API-6 will maintain RAP currencies /lookback
   per API-8 guidance.

                               INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines Initial Qualification Training (IQT) of pilots into unit aircraft. IQT
includes Basic (B course) and transition/re-qualification/senior officer (TX) training and normally will be
conducted during formal syllabus courses at formal training unit (FTU) squadron whenever possible.
Graduates of F-22A FTU will be proficient in F-22A air-to-air and air-to-ground mission tasks as indi-
cated by the Master Task List/Course Training Standards MTL/CTS of the FTU syllabus. In addition, TX
students will graduate current and qualified in ACBT, LASDT CAT I (500’), JDAM, NVG, high-altitude
physiology and receive differences training if operational aircraft possess greater capability than FTU air-
craft. In exceptional circumstances, when FTU training is not available within a reasonable time period,
IQT may be conducted at the local unit IAW provisions of this chapter. This local IQT will normally be
conducted using appropriate formal USAF Transition or Re-qualification Training Course syllabus tracks,
flow programs, and requirements. When local IQT is authorized, the gaining MAJCOM assumes respon-
sibility for the burden of providing this training locally. The following guidance applies only to other than
formal course IQT.

2.2. Approval/Waiver for IQT:
   2.2.1. MAJCOM/A3/XO (ANG: NGB/A3T) is approval authority to conduct local IQT, and (ANG:
   HQ ACC/A3G) is waiver authority to change the formal requirements of locally conducted IQT. Info
   HQ ACC/A3T.
   2.2.2. MAJCOM/CC (ANG: ACC/CG) is the approval authority for non-formal course IQT for Colo-
   nel selects and above to be conducted at the unit to which the officer is assigned.
   2.2.3. Requests to conduct local IQT will include the following:
       2.2.3.1. Justification for the local training in lieu of formal course training.
       2.2.3.2. Summary of individual's flying experience, to include last centrifuge training date.
       2.2.3.3. Date training will begin and expected completion date.
       2.2.3.4. Requested exceptions to formal course syllabus, with rationale.
   2.2.4. Successful completion of IQT requires the upgrading pilot to complete an aircraft qualification
   and instrument evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2F-22AV2, F-22A--Aircrew Evaluation Crite-
   ria).

2.3. Prerequisites. Course prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course syllabus and the
USAF Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA).

2.4. Ground Training.
Ground training may be tailored to the individual’s background and experience or peculiar local condi-
tions. However, available and current reference materials such as AFTTP 3-3, Combat Aircraft Funda-
mentals, instructor guides, and audiovisual programs should be used as supporting materials to the
maximum extent possible. Simulator missions may be accomplished in a Full Mission Trainer (FMT), or
weapons and tactics trainer (WTT), if the FMTs are not available in the Mission Training Center (MTC).

2.5. Flying Training:
     2.5.1. Mission sequence and prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course syllabus.
     2.5.2. Training will be completed within the time specified by the syllabus, as approved. Failure to
     complete within the specified time limit requires notification through channels to MAJCOM/A3
     (ANG: ACC/A3G) with pilot's name, rank, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated comple-
     tion date.
     2.5.3. Pilots in IQT will fly under IP supervision until completing the qualification checkride.
     2.5.4. Formal course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum requirements for IQT. How-
     ever, additional training events, based on student proficiency and background, may be incorporated
     into the IQT program with authorization of the SQ/CC. Additional training due to student non-pro-
     gression is available within the constraints of the formal course syllabus and may be added at the dis-
     cretion of the SQ/CC.

2.6. IQT for Senior Officers:
     2.6.1. All formal training courses for senior officers (colonel selects and above) will be conducted at
     the FTUs unless waived IAW paragraph 2.2.
     2.6.2. Senior officers must meet course entry prerequisites and will complete all syllabus require-
     ments unless waived IAW syllabus and paragraph 2.2.
     2.6.3. If senior officers must be trained at the installation to which they are assigned, they will be in
     formal training status. Unit duties will be turned over to appropriate deputies or vice commanders
     until training is completed. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by MAJCOM/CC (For ANG:
     ACC/ CG. For AETC: 19AF/A3).

                               MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. Mission Qualification Training (MQT) is a unit developed training program that upgrades
newly assigned pilots to BMC or CMR to accomplish the unit mission. Guidance in this chapter is pro-
vided to assist the SQ/CCs in developing their MQT program. The SQ/CC is responsible for developing
the unit specific MQT program and the OG/CC will approve for use. Units are allowed to further tailor
their program for all pilots, based on current qualification, experience, currency, documented perfor-
mance, and formal training. Applicable portions of MQT may be used to create a re-qualification program
for pilots who have regressed from BMC or CMR, to specifically address deficiencies which caused
regression.
   3.1.1. MQT will be completed within 90 calendar days (ANG: 120 calendar days). Timing starts at
   the pilot's first duty day at the gaining operational unit. If a pilot elects to take leave prior to entering
   MQT, the timing will begin after the termination of the pilot's leave. Training is complete upon SQ/
   CC certification to CMR/BMC. Notify MAJCOM/A3T if delay beginning MQT due to security clear-
   ance exceeds 30 days. If training exceeds the specified limit, units will notify MAJCOM/A3 (ANG:
   ACC/A3G).
   3.1.2. The following CMR/BMC training items are granted grace periods for completion after MQT;
   failure to comply will result in regression to N-CMR/N-BMC until training is complete. AAR and
   night training accomplished in IQT may fulfill MQT requirements as determined by the SQ/CC. Night
   MQT may be flown with NVGs if the upgrading pilot is already NVG qualified. Night MQT may be
   combined with the NVG upgrade. All night training requires demonstrated proficiency and currency
   in similar day events, unless accomplished dual with an IP. Unaccomplished AAR and night training
   will be accomplished NLT 90 days (ANG: 180 days) from completion of MQT.
   3.1.3. Pilots in MQT will not fly in Flag FLAG-level exercises, or WSEP. The OG/ CC will determine
   MQT participation in other exercises.
   3.1.4. The night training in MQT will satisfy any unaccomplished night training requirement from
   IQT. If night training was accomplished in IQT, the SQ/CC may certify pilots to BMC/CMR without
   night MQT as long as it is subsequently accomplished prior to night training. Night MQT may be
   flown with NVGs if the upgrading pilot is already NVG qualified. Night MQT may be combined with
   the NVG upgrade. All night training requires demonstrated proficiency and currency in similar day
   events.
   3.1.5. Prior to CMR certification, if not accomplished during FTU training, pilots must complete low
   altitude step-down training (LASDT) category (CAT) I training and initially qualify in all weapons
   delivery/employment events required QUAL at CMR/BMC.

3.2. Ground Training:
   3.2.1. Units will develop blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to their mission as determined
   by the SQ/CC. Training accomplished during IQT may be credited towards this requirement.
   3.2.2. Pilots transferring from another MAJCOM require the theater-specific portions of instrument
   refresher course (IRC) before flying without a theater-experienced pilot in the formation. MQT aca-
   demics and the MQT local area orientation (LAO) mission may satisfy this requirement.
18                                                                     AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006


     3.2.3. Initial Verification: Initial verification will be completed within 90 days (ANG: 180 days)
     after completing MQT. Suggested briefing guide is at Attachment 3. Each pilot (not required for
     BMC) will demonstrate to a formal board a satisfactory knowledge of the squadron’s assigned mis-
     sion. Board composition will be established by the SQ/CC. Desired composition is SQ/CC or SQ/DO
     (chairman), weapons, electronic combat, intelligence, and plans representatives.

3.3. Simulator (SIM) Training:
     3.3.1. FMTs will be used on SIM MQT-1 thru -8 if available. If unavailable, SIM MQT rides may be
     accomplished at the ACS or in the WTT. MQT pilots should fly the missions outlined below. Each
     training device mission will include selected emergency procedures and unusual attitude/inadvertent
     weather entry procedures. During emergency procedure (EP) SIM missions, departure recognition
     and recovery procedures will be accomplished to include region of reduced control operations and out
     of control situations. SIM MQT-1 is a prerequisite for the first MQT flight.
     3.3.2. MQT SIM Profiles:
        3.3.2.1. SIM MQT-1--Local Area Orientation/Instruments/AHC/Day Air-to-Air Refueling
        (DAAR). The purpose of this simulator is to practice the basic AFTTP 3-3.12 fundamentals of air-
        manship that are the focus of MQT 1 and 2 and a requirement for every sortie in the Raptor. The
        simulator should include: normal ground operations; standard departure(s), navigation, emergency
        airfield procedures and approaches, published penetration and approach to primary alternates and
        home base, emergency divert procedures, and EPs. Practice all AHC manuevers planned for
        MQT-1 and MQT-2, including: High Angle of Attack (AOA), High G and High Altitude maneu-
        vering and landings. Practice DAAR.
        3.3.2.2. SIM MQT-2--Tactical Intercepts/Basic Unoppossed Surface Attack. The purpose of
        this simulator is to practice the basic AFTTP 3-1 Vol 12 fundamentals that are the focus of
        MQT-3. The upgradee should develop a sound understanding of low risk, single-ship tactics that
        are the foundation of basic Raptor employment including a firm grasp of flow priorities and signa-
        ture management in the low risk environment. The simulator should include: Alert scramble and
        launch procedures, fence check, sensor search techniques, Raptor specific ID and ROE consider-
        ations, GCI/SOCC procedures, MRM, SRM and GBU-32 employment, attacks against low alti-
        tude low Radar Cross Section (RCS) targets, emergency procedures, instrument recovery and
        approach.
        3.3.2.3. SIM MQT-3--Within Visual Range (WVR)/Air Sovereignty. The purpose of this sim-
        ulator is to practice the basic AFTTP 3-1 Vol 12 fundamentals that are the focus of MQT-4 and
        MQT-5. The upgradee should develop a sound understanding of the transition from low to high
        risk tactics and its affects on flow priority and signature management decisions. Threat capabili-
        ties, High G and numerous airplanes in a small piece of sky combine to make WVR the highest
        risk arena for the Raptor. The upgradee must demonstrate proficiency in transitioning to WVR sin-
        gle-ship, demonstrate proficiency in single-ship WVR Air-to-Air A/A manueuvering (offensive,
        neutral and defensive), demonstrate proficiency in 2-ship detached mutual support transition to
        WVR arena and demonstrate proficiency in 2-ship WVR A/A maneuvering. The upgradee will
        also practice an Air Sovereignty SIM profile to satisfy the MQT-5 profile.
        3.3.2.4. SIM MQT-4—Offensive Counter Air (OCA)- Escort. The purpose of this sim is to
        combine all the basic building blocks (3-3 and 3-1) in a purely air-to-air OCA mission representa-
AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006                                                                              19


       tive of MQT-6. The simulator will include escort of both Low Observable (LO) and Non- LO plat-
       forms against multiple target formations, and targets with Electronic Warfare (EW) capability.
       Practice comm jamming procedures, emergency procedures, instrument recovery and approach.
       3.3.2.5. SIM MQT-5—OCA- Surface Attack (Opposed)/Counterland- Air Interdiction,
       Close air Support (CAS) (Type 2 and Type 3) /Strategic Attack. The purpose of this simulator
       is to combine all the basic building blocks (3-1 and 3-3) on a surface attack mission representative
       of MQT-7. The simulator will include pre-planned and time-sensitive targets defended by surface
       and air threats. The profile will also include unopposed Type 2 and 3 CAS employment to practice
       authentication and 9-line procedures and time sensitve target procedures.
       3.3.2.6. SIM MQT-6--Emergency Procedures Evaluation (If Required). This evaluation will
       be administered by a FE IAW MAJCOM and unit directives.
       3.3.2.7. SIM MQT-7—Night/NVG/Defensive Counter Air (DCA)/Time Sensitive Target/
       Night Aerial Refueling (NAAR). The purpose of this simulator is to combine all the basic build-
       ing blocks (3-1 and 3-3) to perform a night DCA mission representative of MQT-8.
       3.3.2.8. SIM MQT-8—4-Ship Operations. Practice 4-ship tactical operations on an OCA sortie
       (SQ/CC discretion on exact scenario).

3.4. Flying Training. The appropriate missions from those listed below will be used to upgrade to BMC
and CMR. Unit-developed MQT programs should use profiles typical of squadron missions. The simula-
tor profiles above should be adjusted and flown as pre-requisites for the sorties.
   3.4.1. Supervision. A FL-qualified SQ supervisor or IP in the element is required unless specified
   otherwise. On some sorties, more specific guidance is provided. The SQ/CC will determine the proper
   flight position of the supervisor/IP unless specified otherwise.
   3.4.2. If more than 14 calendar days elapse between sorties, an additional review sortie will be flown
   before continuing in the program.
   3.4.3. All pilots must conduct practice airborne emergency procedures training during any one of the
   MQT sorties. As a minimum, the training will consist of briefing, flying, and debriefing a simulated
   critical action procedures scenario per each phase of flight.
   3.4.4. Sortie Requirements. The LAO/AHC/Instrument mission is mandatory. The Mission Evalua-
   tion Checkride, flown IAW AFI 11-202V2, (AFI 11-2F-22AV2) is also mandatory. The sorties listed
   in paragraphs 3.4.5., Air Dominance, and 3.4.6., Low Altitude Step-Down Training, are suggested
   mission profiles that SQ/CCs may use to develop the unit's MQT program based on unit tasking.

       11-2F-22AV2, and local standardization/evaluation criteria on a mission representing the unit's
       primary mission tasking (SQ/CC discretion).
    3.4.6. Low Altitude Step-Down Training (LASDT):
       3.4.6.1. To conduct low altitude operations safely, pilots need to be knowledgeable of aircraft han-
       dling and performance characteristics, tactical formation, intercept, offensive maneuvering and
       defensive reactions, and navigation. The low altitude environment requires a well-supervised
       LASDT program, including initial certification and currency requirements. LASDT qualifies
       pilots to conduct low altitude training (LOWAT) at or below 1,000 feet AGL. LOWAT block/cate-
       gory certification is required in a low altitude block prior to performing unsupervised operations
       in that low altitude block.
       3.4.6.2. Category 1 is listed in Table 3.1., and there is no requirement to progress beyond Cate-
       gory I. The training program is based on instructor/Squadron supervisor assessment of pilot per-
       formance, TR compliance, and judgment. LASDT missions will be supervised by an IP or
       FL-qualified squadron supervisor who has completed LASDT training and is current.

I                   1,000-500                 LASDT 1, LASDT 2, LASDT 3

       3.4.6.3. Demonstrated proficiency down to 500 feet AGL is required for Category I qualification
       and is normally accomplished during IQT and/or MQT. SQ/CC may accept a transfer pilot's
       LOWAT qualification from previous IQT or MQT. Category I qualification is a minimum require-
       ment for CMR status.
       3.4.6.4. Entry into LASDT (other than at FTU) requires SQ/CC approval. The altitude to which a
       pilot is certified is determined by the SQ/CC and based on the lowest altitude at which all tasks
       can be comfortably performed and proficiency demonstrated. The goal is proficiency down to the
22                                                                   AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006


     minimum altitude compatible with squadron mission. Upon successful completion of LASDT
     training, the SQ/CC will certify the pilot to LASDT category I. Squadrons may accept docu-
     mented LASDT certification for pilots coming from other units/ commands. With SQ/CC
     approval, low altitude training conducted at a formal course may be used to fulfill applicable
     requirements of this paragraph.
     3.4.6.5. LASDT will be scheduled and briefed as a primary portion of the mission. Compatible
     RAP CT sorties and events may be accomplished in conjunction with LASDT as long as the
     objectives of LASDT training are met. LASDT training will not be accomplished on an alternate
     mission. IPs/FLs must be aware of the added stress and task loading associated with low altitude
     operations and provide breaks in training above the training altitude. Develop training profiles to
     avoid over-tasking the upgrading pilot, and upgrade sortie continuity should be emphasized.

     11-2F-22AV3, F-22A--Operations Procedures. During LASDT, KIOs will include a climb to
     above 1000 feet AGL.
     3.4.6.7. An IP or squadron supervisor, in the element, will supervise all sorties.
     3.4.6.8. Ground Training. LASDT training. Coverage should support the mission and concept
     of operations of the squadron, incorporating appropriate portions of AFTTP 3-1V12, and AFFTP
     3-3.12. Complete all academic training prior to flight training/briefing.
        3.4.6.8.1. AHC. Discuss aircraft performance as it applies to the low altitude environment, to
        include: control response (low/high speed, speed brake use); afterburner (fuel considerations,
        selection techniques), acceleration/ deceleration, level turns, vertical maneuvering, climb/
        dive/slice, recoveries, effects of gross weight, power settings, density altitude, G-loading, and
        bank angles; terrain avoidance (ridge crossings), Head Up Display (HUD) use, terrain clear-
        ance versus turning room, dangers inherent in over-banking during turns, importance of fre-
        quent cross check of aircraft attitude relative to horizon; and the videotape "How Low Can
        You Go?"
        3.4.6.8.2. Environmental Factors. Discuss out-of-cockpit visibility and Field of View
        (FOV) restrictions, sun angle, terrain and G-excess-illusions/perceptions, Weather (WX) con-
        siderations and the importance of relaying WX information to the weather flight, and use of
        the HUD.
        3.4.6.8.3. Task Management. Discuss low altitude tasks and task management/prioritization
        concept.
        3.4.6.8.4. Low Altitude Tactical Formation (LATF). Discuss formations, hazards at low
        altitudes, task prioritization, tactical turns, visual lookout/ mutual support.
        3.4.6.8.5. Defensive Reactions. Discuss visual lookout and mutual support, threat weapons
        systems envelopes, defensive maneuvering against air-to-air and surface-to-air threats, and
        flight member de-confliction.
        3.4.6.8.6. Low Level Awareness. Discuss factors affecting low level awareness: airspeeds
        and maneuverability, formation size and design, formation and pilot responsibilities, environ-
        mental effects on visibility, factors influencing individual proficiency and airmanship, route
        familiarity and complacency, air turbulence, jet wash and bird strike, route obstacles, terrain

            cation (EID)/VID procedures against a low/slow target (dissimilar asset is required if avail-
            able) with emphasis placed on threat VID procedures IAW AFTTP 3-1V12. This ride is not
            required for LOWAT Category I, but should be accomplished as part of pre-deployment
            spin-up training in support of contingency operations or exercises.

3.5. Initial Aircrew Chemical Defense Training (ACDT). (N/A for CB/TF-coded and ANG ADF
units) Is designed to ensure pilot proficiency in the overall use of the Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensem-
ble (ACDE) and to familiarize pilots with combat capabilities while wearing ACDE. Pilots must complete
Initial ACDT NLT 90 days (ANG: 180 days) from MQT completion. Initial ACDT affects CMR/BMC,
but is non-grounding. All initial ACDT is to be accomplished prior to the first ACDE flight. Pilots will be
ACDE certified upon the completion of initial ACDT. Pilots who accomplished initial ACDT in previous
tours in a fighter type MDS are not required to reaccomplish the ACDE Flight.
     3.5.1. Ground Training. Aircrew Chemical Defense Training/ACDT (LL04) initial and CT
     refresher thereafter. Egress Training with ACDE (LL05) IAW AFI 11-301, and Emergency Parachute
     Training with ACDE IAW AFI 16-1301-will be accomplished once in a career (per MDS).
     3.5.2. Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE) SIM. A SIM mission in full ACDE gear
     (anti-exposure suit liner may be substituted), harness, and G-suit. Within the mission profile, practice
     doffing simulated contaminated equipment. An ACDE SIM mission may use existing SIM mission
     profiles and count toward TAC SIM training cycle requirements. Units will use their best available
     simulator or actual aircraft cockpit for ACDE SIM training. The ACDE SIM will be accomplished
     once in a career (per MDS), and should be conducted as close as possible to the day before (but not
     more than 30 days prior) to the ACDE flight.
     3.5.3. Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE) Flight. The ACDE flight will be accom-
     plished once in a career (unless previously accomplished in a fighter type MDS). Flight training must
     consider limitations of operating while wearing ACDE. Full donning and doffing procedures/
     sequence will be practiced in conjunction with the ACDE flight but the only ACDE worn in-flight will
     be mask, filter pack, and gloves.
     3.5.4. ACDE Flight Restrictions:
        3.5.4.1. Pilots will be fully current and qualified in an event prior to accomplishing that event on
        an ACDE flight.
        3.5.4.2. Minimum formation spacing is route unless fingertip is required for safe mission accom-
        plishment (i.e., WX penetration).
        3.5.4.3. Minimum altitude is 500 feet AGL except takeoffs, approaches and landings.
        3.5.4.4. No ACBT or night sorties. AAR requires an IP in the flight.
        3.5.4.5. Weather minimums are 1,500 feet ceiling and 3 miles (4.8 km) visibility for pilots wear-
        ing ACDE.
        3.5.4.6. Solo operations will be supervised by an ACDE qualified FL from a chase position. For-
        mations, to include chase, are limited to two-ship and only one pilot in the element will be wearing
        ACDE. Pilots wearing ACDE gear will not fly in dissimilar formations.
        3.5.4.7. Operations supervision should not conduct ACDE flight training when, in their judgment,
        temperature/dew point conditions are not favorable to safe operations.

                                                Chapter 4

                                    CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General. This chapter and the current F-22A RAP tasking memo , outlines ground and flying train-
ing requirements for CMR, BMC, and BAQ pilots. Pilots must be qualified IAW AFI 11-11-202V1 and
AFI 11-11-202V2. Additionally, they must complete IQT to fly in BAQ status, and MQT or FTU IP
upgrade to fly in BMC status.

4.2. Ground Training. Pilots will accomplish ground training IAW the RAP Tasking memo and Table
4.1. The table is a single-source reference for MDS-specific ground training only and does not include
non-MDS-specific ancillary training. Waiver authority for each event is IAW the specified reference
directive. Where discrepancies exist, the reference directive takes precedence. Units may credit ground
training accomplished during IQT/MQT toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was
accomplished. .
   4.2.1. Simulator (SIM): Virtual Warfighting System (ViWS), Full Mission Trainer (FMT), Air
   Combat Simulator (ACS), Weapons and Tactics Trainer (WTT).
       4.2.1.1. Table 4.2. As applicable, depicts the minimum SIM training requirements. SQ/CC will
       determine the minimum number/type of training device continuation training (CT) missions that
       require supervision. Units should determine additional CT training device supervision require-
       ments based on expected employment tasking, training device capabilities, and mission training
       objectives.
       4.2.1.2. Units will develop scenarios that cover all critical action and precision instrument proce-
       dures, and will develop other scenario requirements based on expected employment tasking and
       training device capabilities. Emphasis should be placed on training not readily attainable during
       daily flying activities. Units will review scenarios annually and update as required.
       4.2.1.3. Unusual attitude and inadvertent weather entry procedures training and low altitude
       unusual attitude recovery training will be accomplished during all Aircrew Training Device (ATD)
       training. Unusual attitude training will include recognition of HUD limitations, non-HUD recov-
       eries and use of the Standby Flight group.
           4.2.1.3.1. During EP ViWS/FMT/WTT/ACS missions, departure recognition and recovery
           procedures will be accomplished to include both High AOA, and out-of-control situations.
       4.2.1.4. Pilots may receive credit for training accomplished in special devices such as the Air
       Combat Simulator (ACS), or HHQ-directed simulator test support, etc., if approved by the SQ/
       CC.
       4.2.1.5. Tactical missions may be accomplished in either the MTC or FMT/WTT. EP missions
       will be accomplished in the MTC or FMT. If a unit does not have access to an MTC or FMT, EP
       missions will be accomplished in the WTT.
   4.2.2. Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT).
       4.2.2.1. This training is not an evaluation, but a review of abnormal/emergency procedures and
       aircraft systems operations/limitations during realistic scenarios. One pilot should present a situa-
       tion and another discusses actions necessary to cope with the malfunction and carry it to a logical
26                                                                       AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006


        conclusion. Critical action/Boldface procedures (if applicable) and squadron special interest items
        should be emphasized. Incorporate the following elements into squadron SEPT training programs:
            4.2.2.1.1. SQ/CC/DO involvement in the selection of a monthly SEPT topic.
            4.2.2.1.2. Develop SEPT scenarios using F-22A mishaps/incidents as baseline cases.
            4.2.2.1.3. Discuss at least one EP for each major subsystem (engine, FLCS, IVSC, APU, elec-
            trical, hydraulic and fuel) in each session. The EPs should also span all phases of flight.
            4.2.2.1.4. Accomplish two SEPTs each training cycle with an IP or SQ supervisor to include
            minimum fuel and emergency divert training.
        4.2.2.2. The intent of SEPT training is that each pilot accomplishes an SEPT in the month they are
        flying. SEPT training will be accomplished each calendar month, and the currency will expire at
        the end of the following month. Failure to accomplish by the end of the month will result in
        grounding until subsequently completed.
        4.2.2.3. SEPTs will be accomplished in a FMT or WTT, if available. If a FMT/WTT is not avail-
        able, SEPTs should be accomplished one-on-one, but small flight-sized groups are allowable in
        order that all members participate to the full extent and share equal time responding to emergency
        situations.
        4.2.2.4. Completion of a simulator EP profile satisfies the monthly SEPT requirement. For IP/ FE
        administering the SEPT/EP Sim will satisfy their SEPT requirement.
        4.2.2.5. Formal course student SEPTs may satisfy the monthly SEPT requirement for the IP whom
        administers this training.
     4.2.3. Ground training will be IAW Table 4.1. See RAP tasking memo.
     4.2.4. Weapons/Tactics Academic Training. Units will establish a weapons/ tactics academic train-
     ing program to satisfy MQT and CT requirements. Training is required in each training cycle. Audio-
     visual programs may be used in place of academic instruction. The program will require successful
     completion of an examination (85 percent minimum to pass). Use testing to validate qualification to
     the maximum extent possible throughout the training program. Pilots successfully scoring 85 percent
     or greater may be given training credit in lieu of ground CT, where authorized by the governing pub-
     lication.
        4.2.4.1. Academic instructors should be USAFWS graduates or have attended the applicable aca-
        demic portion(s) of school, if possible.
        4.2.4.2. Instruction and tests should include (as applicable), but are not limited to:
            4.2.4.2.1. Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground weapons description, operation, parameters, fusing,
            limitations, preflight, tactics, normal and emergency procedures/techniques.
            4.2.4.2.2. ACBT. Principles of aerodynamics, maneuverability, AHC, formations, signature
            management, flow priorities, tactical intercept principles, alert procedures and scrambles, use
            of GCI/AWACS, and enemy capabilities.
            4.2.4.2.3. Electronic combat equipment, capabilities, operation, checks, procedures, IRMD/
            RMD, countermeasures, and hostile EW tactics.
AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006                                                                            27


         4.2.4.2.4. Specialized training to support specific weapons, tactics (to include threat VID tac-
         tics), mission capabilities, authentication, wartime ROE, and safe passage.
         4.2.4.2.5. Low altitude flying academics review IAW the outline in paragraph 3.4.5.8.,
         LASDT Ground Training.
         4.2.4.2.6. An NVG academic review (as applicable), taught by an NVG qualified instructor,
         IAW the academic outline in paragraph 6.9.
  4.2.5. Verification:
     4.2.5.1. Continuation verification updates pilots on their squadron's wartime mission. Each pilot
     will participate in a squadron initial/continuation verification every 20 months as a briefer, board
     member, or seminar participant. Pilots who participate in a unit deployment to a tasked theater of
     operations may receive credit for continuation verification.
         4.2.5.1.1. BMC pilots should accomplish an initial verification and/or participate in continua-
         tion verifications to facilitate future upgrade to CMR status, at the discretion of the SQ/CC.
  4.2.6. US/Russia Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities. Initial, annual refresher, and
  pre-deployment training for the prevention of Dangerous Military Activities will be conducted to
  ensure that all pilots are familiar with the agreement and the implementing provisions contained in
  CJCSI 2311.01. The procedures for the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities between the U.S.
  and Russia section of the Flight Information Handbook.
28                                                                                AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006

4.3. Flying Training. All pilots except API-8 and ACC/IGS inspectors will accomplish the requirements
as shown on Table 4.2. API-8 and ACC/IGS flyers will strive to accomplish the requirements as shown
on Table 4.2.. Failure to accomplish these requirements may not affect BAQ, BMC, or CMR status but
may require additional training as determined by the SQ/CC. If any sortie or event requirement from
Table 4.2. is subsequently added in the RAP tasking memo , it becomes a requirement for BMC or CMR
status (as specified in the RAP tasking memo ). In addition, the following are required:
   4.3.1. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) Requirements:
        4.3.1.1. Qualification Evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2F-22AV2).

        4.3.1.2. Currencies (as applicable) IAW paragraph 4.6.
        4.3.1.3. BAQ pilots will fly a supervised sortie (squadron supervisor or IP) at least once every 60
        calendar days. In addition, if a BAQ pilot does not fly for 21 days (inexperienced) or 30 days
        (experienced), the next sortie must be flown with a squadron supervisor or an IP.
        4.3.1.4. BAQ pilots that remain in BAQ status for more than 6 months will be grounded (except
        General Officers), unless waived by MAJCOM A3.
     4.3.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC) Requirements:
        4.3.2.1. Qualification and Mission Evaluations IAW AFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2F-22AV2).

4.4. Special Categories.
   4.4.1. MAJCOM and NAF API -8 Pilots. (ANG: Responsibilities for API -8 staff flyers are contained
   in AFI 11-401 as supplemented by the ANG).
       4.4.1.1. Mission Directed Training (MDT) for HHQ personnel (other than that conducted in sup-
       port of a formal inspection) requires coordination with the supporting unit. MAJCOM Division
       Chiefs and NAF/A3 are reviewing authorities for assigned personnel. They will:
           4.4.1.1.1. Coordinate with the supporting agency to ensure appropriate ARMS data is main-
           tained and provided IAW AFI 11-401.
           4.4.1.1.2. Review assigned pilots accomplishments and currencies prior to authorizing pilots
           to participate in MDT.
           4.4.1.1.3. Provide each pilot with written documentation specifying the sortie types and
           events the pilot is authorized to fly. API -8 personnel who fly with only one unit may receive
           this from their attached unit commander.
       4.4.1.2. HHQ flying personnel maintaining BMC status are exempt from academic ground train-
       ing, NAAR, CW training, and special training programs within authorized mission areas. Provide
       specific currencies to the host squadron and HHQ supervisors will determine pilot qualifications
       to participate in squadron scenarios for MDT.
       4.4.1.3. Pilots will:
           4.4.1.3.1. Review accomplishments and currencies for accuracy.
           4.4.1.3.2. Submit qualification and/or authorization documentation to the supporting SQ/CC/
           DO or authorized representative prior to flying with that squadron.
           4.4.1.3.3. Evaluate the demands of each mission scenario and ensure that their ability/profi-
           ciency will not be exceeded.
       4.4.1.4. IPs may perform instructor duties with the concurrence of the OG/ CC, if qualified and
       current for the applicable missions/events.

4.5. Multiple Qualification/Currency:
   4.5.1. MAJCOM/A3 (ANG: NGB/A3) may authorize qualification in more than one mission design
   series (MDS) aircraft for pilots only when such action is directed by command mission requirements
   and is economically justifiable. This authority cannot be delegated below MAJCOM level. Unless
   required for unit mission accomplishment, commanders must not permit pilots qualified in primary
   mission aircraft to maintain qualification in support aircraft. Individuals assigned to positions covered
   by paragraph 4.5.2. have MAJCOM A3 approval, and do not need to submit specific requests.
       4.5.1.1. Submit multiple qualification requests through command channels to MAJCOM/A3
       (ANG: NGB/A3). All requests must contain full justification. Approval for a multiple qualifica-
       tion request must be provided to the appropriate host installation aviation management office;
       flight accomplishments are not authorized until aircraft assignment is updated into ARMS.
       4.5.1.2. Individually authorized multiple qualifications are valid as long as the individual is
       assigned to the specific position, and aircraft requested, or until rescinded by the approval author-
       ity.

     4.5.3. Multiple qualification is not appropriate for senior wing supervisors of units with different
     types of aircraft. Wing commanders will qualify in only one of their wing's aircraft. Either the Wing/
     CV or OG/CC should qualify in another of the wing's aircraft (not the same one selected by the WG/
     CC).
     4.5.4. Multiple Requirements. Pilots will satisfy at least 50 percent of the sortie requirements of
     their primary aircraft in that aircraft. If CMR, they will meet all RAP sortie/event requirements of the
     primary aircraft. In addition, pilots will fly an equitable distribution of emergency patterns, instrument
     sorties, penetrations, non-precision approaches, and precision approaches in each MDS to fill their
     non-RAP requirements.
     4.5.5. Multiple Currencies. Pilots will fly at least once each 45 days in each aircraft. They will com-
     ply with all other currency requirements for each aircraft.
     4.5.6. Pilots must complete conversion training IAW an approved syllabus.

4.6. Currencies/Re-currencies/Re-qualification:
     4.6.1. Currency. Table 4.3. defines currency requirements for all F-22A pilots. If a pilot loses a par-
     ticular currency, that sortie/event may not be performed except for the purpose of regaining currency
     as noted.
     4.6.2. Re-currency is required whenever a pilot exceeds a currency requirement in this volume.
        4.6.2.1. Overdue training requirements must be satisfied before the pilot is considered qualified to
        perform tasks applicable to the type of training in which delinquent. Training annotated as affect-
        ing CMR status will require regression to N-CMR until appropriate training as specified by SQ/
        CC is accomplished. Training identified as not affecting CMR status does not require regression
        from CMR although it may result in grounding until training is completed (e.g., life support train-
        ing). The duration of grounding and status of sortie lookback will determine the effect on CMR
        status.
        4.6.2.2. Unless otherwise specified, supervisory requirements pertaining to recurrency may be
        satisfied in the cockpit or flight position that offers the best control of the mission, as determined
        by the SQ/CC.
     4.6.3. MAJCOM/AOS Currency Requirements. Units will comply with AFI 11-207, Combat Air-
     craft Delivery, for additional currencies required for the flight delivery of aircraft coordinated through
     MAJCOM/AOS.
     4.6.4. Landing/Sortie Recurrency:
        4.6.4.1. Loss of landing/sortie currency requires the following action (timing starts from the last
        landing):
            4.6.4.1.1. 31-90 Days (46-90 Days - Experienced). Regain landing currency.
            4.6.4.1.2. 91-135 Days. Same as above, plus instructor supervised SIM (tactics, normal and
            emergency procedures for CMR pilots; normal, instrument, and emergency procedures for
            BMC pilots).
AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006                                                                           35


         4.6.4.1.3. 136-210 Days (225 – Experienced) . Same as above, plus (CMR/BMC) closed and
         open qualification examinations and an EPE evaluation.
         4.6.4.1.4. 211 (Inexperienced)/ 226 (Expereinced) or More Days. IQT, landing recurrency,
         LASDT re-qualification, and appropriate weapons event initial qualification.
  4.6.5. ACBT Recurrency:
     4.6.5.1. Pilots losing currency in ACBT must accomplish the following sorties:
         4.6.5.1.1. 61-90 Days (91-120 Experienced). AHC and WVR manuevering.
         4.6.5.1.2. 91-180 Days (121-180 Experienced). AHC, and WVR manuevering.
         4.6.5.1.3. Over 180 Days. Re-accomplish a tailored program IAW Chapter 3.
  4.6.6. Loss of/Re-qualification to IP Status. IPs will be decertified if:
     4.6.6.1. Failure of a Flight Check. To regain IP status, the IP must successfully complete a flight
     check IAW AFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2F-22AV2).
     4.6.6.2. Expiration of IP currency: To regain status, see Table 4.3.
     4.6.6.3. Loss of CMR/BMC status due to loss of currency in an event/sortie and the SQ/CC deems
     decertification is required. If the SQ/CC does not elect this option or if the instructor becomes
     non-current in events/sorties that do not require removal from CMR/BMC status, instructor status
     may be retained, but the IP will not instruct in that event/sortie until the required currency is
     regained.
  4.6.7. NVG Demanding Mission Re-currency. Pilots losing NVG demanding mission currency
  must accomplish the following events prior to unrestricted night operations:
     4.6.7.1. 2-ship basic formation work / light drills and unit specific mission elements.
     4.6.7.2. Tactical turns and maneuvers.
     4.6.7.3. Minimum of one intercept IAW NVG-2 profile not to exceed 1v1.

NOTES:
1.  See Attachment 2 for demanding/non-demanding sortie definitions. In addition, BAQ pilots will fly in a supervised
    status (with a SQ supervisor or IP) any time a non-demanding sortie is required.
2. Re-currency supervision level will be SQ supervisor or instructor as chase, qualified and current in the event.
3. Supervision will be SQ supervisor or instructor, qualified and current in the event. For NVG currency, supervision will
    be an NVG current, qualified SQ supervisor or instructor.
4. Performance or instruction will update CT ACBT currency. Performance or instruction of LOWAT will update CT
    LOWAT currency.
5. LOW A/A - Event is defined as performing realistic, mission oriented operations while in a LOWAT certified low alti-
    tude block (at or below 1000 ft AGL). Event includes skills necessary to seek out, and engage offensively, an aerial tar-
    get at low altitude. For the F-22A, this event also includes low altitude navigation, 2-ship formation, defensive
    maneuvering to avoid or negate threats.
6. Currency is required in the pilots low altitude category for operations below 1000 feet (Category I, II, III) Re-currency
    requires satisfactory performance in the following events: vertical awareness training, hard turns, 2-ship formation and
    offensive/defensive visual maneuvering.
7. Instructor pilot currency is 60 days. Non-currency for 61-180 days requires an instructor re-currency flight with an IP;
    over 180 days requires a Stan/Eval flight check.
8. An NVG academic review is required prior to the recurrency sortie.
9. For IPs, accomplishing or instructing the event will update currency.
10. If non-current in precision approaches, increase the pilot weather minimum by one category. If day VFR, the supervi-
    sion level is a pilot, current and qualified in the event; all other times require an IP IAW AFI 11-202 V3. Precison
    approaches accomplished in the FMT count for currency. Pilots may regain their currency in an FMT on a case-by-case
    basis with SQ/CC approval.
11. To update or regain currency, pilot must accomplish High AOA low G, High altitude and High G AHC manuevers.
12. Supervision for flight or simulator will be a current and qualified FCF pilot.

4.7. Regression.
   4.7.1. CMR/BMC Regression for Failure to Meet Lookback. Only RAP training and Contingency
   Operations sorties may be used for lookback. If a pilot does not meet lookback requirements through-
   out the training cycle, SQ/CCs can either regress the pilot to N-CMR/N-BMC status, as applicable;
   remove the pilot from an CMR manning position; or initiate action to remove the pilot from active fly-
   ing status.
      4.7.1.1. Failure to meet 1-month RAP/Contingency Operations sortie lookback requires a review
      of the pilot's 3-month sortie history. If the 3-month lookback has been met, the pilot may, at SQ/
      CC discretion, remain CMR/BMC. Failure to meet the 3-month lookback will result in regression
      to N-CMR/N-BMC status as appropriate, or the pilot may be placed in probation status for 1
      month at the SQ/CC's discretion. If probation is chosen, the only way to remove a pilot from pro-
      bation and preserve the current status is to re-establish a 1-month lookback at the end of the pro-
      bation period (see Figure 4.1.).
      4.7.1.2. CMR/BMC pilots regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC for lookback, must complete a SQ/CC
      approved re-certification program to return the pilot to CMR/BMC standards. Upon completion of
      the re-certification program, the CMR/BMC pilots must also meet 1-month lookback requirement
      prior to reclaiming CMR/BMC status. The sorties and events accomplished during the re-certifi-
      cation program may be credited towards their total/type sortie and event requirements for the
      training cycle as well as for their monthly sortie requirement.
      4.7.1.3. Lookback computations begin following completion of MQT. The aircrew must maintain
      1-month lookback until 3-month lookback is established. SQ/CCs may apply probation rules as
      described in paragraph 4.7.1.1. if a new CMR/BMC pilot fails to meet 1-month lookback while
      establishing 3-month lookback. In addition, 1-month lookback will start the first full month of
      CMR/BMC status.
   4.7.2. Regression for Weapons Qualification. Failure to maintain RAP tasked weapons qualifica-
   tion at the end of the training cycle will require:
      4.7.2.1. For Events Tasked as Qual at CMR/BMC. Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC. To regain
      CMR/BMC, the pilot must re-achieve initial qualification in the deficient weapons event (see
      paragraph 5.2.). Events accomplished for this initial qualification may count toward the cumula-
      tive CT event qualification required at the end of the training cycle.
      4.7.2.2. For Events Tasked as FAM at CMR/BMC, Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC. To
      regain CMR/BMC, the pilot must accomplish at least three of the weapons deliveries under the
      supervision of a squadron supervisor or instructor. Events accomplished for this initial qualifica-
      tion may count toward the cumulative CT event qualification required at the end of the next train-
      ing cycle.
   4.7.3. Pilots who fail an aircraft qualification, mission, or instrument evaluation will be handled IAW
   AFI 11-202V2 (AFI 11-2F-22AV2). Pilots will regress to N-CMR/N-BMC as applicable. These pilots
   will remain N-CMR/N-BMC until successfully completing required corrective action, a re-evaluation,
   and are re-certified by the SQ/CC.
38                                                                        AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006


4.8. End of Cycle Requirements.
Pilots who fail to complete sortie and/or event requirements of this volume by the end of the training cycle
may require additional training depending on the type and magnitude of the deficiency. Refer to para-
graph 4.9. to see if some of these requirements can be prorated. In all cases, report training shortfalls IAW
paragraph 1.12.
     4.8.1. Pilots that fail to meet the total RAP sortie requirement may continue CT at CMR/BMC as
     determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is required.
     4.8.2. Pilots that fail to meet non-RAP sortie and/or event requirements may continue CT at CMR/
     BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is required.
     4.8.3. Failure to meet RAP Sortie Type Requirements will result in one of the following:
        4.8.3.1. Regression to N-CMR/N-BMC if the SQ/CC determines that the sortie type deficiency is
        significant. To regain CMR/BMC, the aircrew will complete all deficient sortie types. These sor-
        ties may be counted against the total requirements for the new training cycle.
        4.8.3.2. Continuation at CMR/BMC if total RAP sorties and lookback are maintained and the sor-
        tie type deficiencies are deemed insignificant by the SQ/CC.
     4.8.4. Failure to accomplish sorties required for Special Capabilities/Qualifications will result in loss
     of that qualification. The SQ/CC will determine re-qualification requirements.

4.9. Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC may prorate
all training requirements when DNIFs, emergency leaves, Consecutive Overseas Tour (COT) leaves,
non-flying TDY/exercises (ANG: and or mandatory training required by civilian employment), combat/
contingency deployments, preclude training for a portion of the training period. Normal leave will not be
considered as non-availability. Extended bad weather, which precludes the unit from flying for more than
15 consecutive days maybe considered as non-availability. (ANG: End-of-cycle proration is permitted for
documented attrition (i.e. HHQ or weather cancels, MNDs, ground or air aborts) in monthly increments
when the total number of occurrences ranges from one half to one times the individual’s normal monthly
rate of flying). The following guidelines apply:
     4.9.1. Proration will only be used to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-availability, not
     to mask training or planning deficiencies.
     4.9.2. Proration is based on cumulative days of training non-availability in the training cycle. Use
     Table 4.4. to determine the number of months to be prorated based on the cumulative calendar days of
     training non-availability.
     4.9.3. If IQT or MQT is re-accomplished, a pilot's training cycle will start over at a prorated share fol-
     lowing completion of IQT/MQT training.

   4.9.4. Example: Capt Jones was granted 17 days of emergency leave in January and attended SOS in
   residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days. His SQ/CC authorized a total
   of two months proration from his training cycle (two months for the 73 cumulative days of non-avail-
   ability for flying). (ANG: Maj Jang is an experienced CMR pilot with a normal monthly requirement
   of 6 sorties. He had eight attrition occurences throughout the training cycle, therefore his SQ/CC can
   prorate one month of Maj Jang’s training requirements).
   4.9.5. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 will be rounded to the next lower whole
   number, but no requirement may be prorated below one.
   4.9.6. Newly assigned/converted pilots and pilots achieving CMR/BMC after the 15th of the month
   are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration purposes. Events and
   sorties for the remainder of the training cycle may be prorated. A prorated share of RAP sorties must
   be completed in CT.
40                                                                         AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006


     4.9.7. Night, TDU-32 A/B (Banner), and AAR requirements accomplished during MQT may be cred-
     ited toward prorated CT requirements if accomplished during the cycle in which the pilot was
     declared CMR/BMC, unless specified otherwise by MAJCOM.
     4.9.8. A pilot's last month on station prior to departing PCS may be prorated provided 1 month's pro-
     ration is not exceeded. Individuals departing PCS may be considered CMR for reporting purposes
     during a period of 60 days from date of last flight, or until loss of CMR currency, port call date, or sign
     in at new duty station which ever occurs first.
     4.9.9. CMR pilots who attend F-22A USAFWS in TDY-and-return status may be reported throughout
     the TDY as CMR. Upon return, those pilots will accomplish a prorated share of sortie/event require-
     ments (see Table 4.4.).
     4.9.10. Contingency Operations. Contingency operations can have a positive or negative impact on
     a unit's CT program, as emphasis is on supporting the actual contingency. A potential lack of training
     opportunities while supporting contingency operations can place a burden on the unit, forcing it to
     accomplish the majority of its CT program in a reduced period of time or with reduced assets. The fol-
     lowing proration procedures are intended to provide flexibility in accomplishing the unit's CT pro-
     gram.
        4.9.10.1. All sorties flown during contingency operations may be logged as contingency opera-
        tions sorties. If adequate training was accomplished during the sortie, it can be logged as a RAP
        sortie. Contingency sorties do not count toward RAP requirements, but may be used for lookback
        purposes. When logging a contingency sortie, AAR, CHAFF, FLARE, HAVE QUICK, and
        SECURE VOICE, may count against RAP requirements and may be used to update currencies.
        All other events will not count toward RAP requirements, but may be used to update currency.
        Upon relief from contingency operations, units will prorate RAP sorties and events for the period
        of time each individual was tasked. In addition, proration is authorized for the deployment prepa-
        ration and deployment recovery time where home station flying is reduced by the MAJCOM.
            4.9.10.1.1. For ANG units, individuals deployed for more than a seven day period may prorate
            a one month portion of RAP sorties and events.
        4.9.10.2. As the training quality of missions flown at contingency locations may vary consider-
        ably, OG/CCs are authorized to allow sorties that provided valid training to be logged as RAP sor-
        ties. Events accomplished on these sorties count toward RAP event requirements, and these
        sorties/events may not be prorated.
            4.9.10.2.1. Upon release from contingency operations, proration is computed by calculating
            the sorties to be prorated for the entire deployment, and then subtracting the number of valid
            RAP sorties as authorized by the OG/CC. The result is the allowable sortie proration. Negative
            numbers equate to zero. Events will be prorated at SQ/CC discretion based on the events
            accomplished during valid RAP sorties.

4.10. Regaining CMR/BMC Status:
     4.10.1. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet the end of cycle weapons qualifications and/
     or event requirements, re-qualification is IAW paragraph 4.7.
     4.10.2. If CMR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.7., the following
     applies (timing starts from the date the pilot came off CMR/BMC status):
AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006                                                                                41


       4.10.2.1. Up to 90 Days. The pilot must complete SQ/CC directed re-certification program in
       accordance with paragraph 4.7.1.2. In addition, all RAP event currencies must be regained. The
       SQ/CC will approve any other additional training prior to re-certification to CMR.
       4.10.2.2. 91-180 Days. Same as above, plus qualification and tactical written examinations.
       4.10.2.3. 181 Days and Beyond. Re-accomplish MQT.

4.11. Example of the Lookback, Regression, Proration, and Re-Qualification Process:
   4.11.1. Capt Smith is an experienced CMR pilot in ACC with a 1 and 3 month lookback requirement
   of 9 and 24 RAP sorties respectively. On Feb 3, he flew an ACBT sortie prior to departing for a
   non-flying TDY staff tour for two months. He reported back for flight duty on 6 Apr. What is his sta-
   tus throughout his TDY and on his return?
       4.11.1.1. The SQ/CC wanted to list Capt Smith as a countable CMR pilot for reporting purposes
       throughout the TDY. Therefore, on 1 Mar, his Flt/CC performed the mandatory 1 month lookback
       (Feb) on Capt Smith. He only flew 1 RAP sortie, failing the 1 month lookback. The Flt/CC then
       performed a 3 month lookback (Dec, Jan, Feb). This showed that he flew only 20 sorties for this
       period. Had he flown four more sorties, his SQ/CC could continue Capt Smith at CMR. However,
       with 20 sorties, Capt Smith did not meet the 3 month lookback for a CMR pilot.
       4.11.1.2. The SQ/CC decided to carry Capt Smith on 1-month probation. On 1 Apr, Capt Smith's
       1 month-lookback (Mar) was 0 sorties. The SQ/CC must now regress Capt Smith to N-CMR.
       When Capt Smith returns, the SQ/CC will have to place him in a re-certification program. Upon
       completing this program, Capt Smith will need to re-establish his 1-month lookback by 1 May.
       Failing to do so would force him to be reported N-CMR for an additional month until the next
       lookback process on 1 June.
       4.11.1.3. If he had returned on 22 Mar, and had last landed the jet 48 days ago, he could fly a
       non-demanding sortie to regain demanding sortie and landing currency. For CMR purposes, Capt
       Smith would need to fly 9 RAP sorties to recapture his 1-month lookback and get off probation.
       Although Capt Smith was still CMR in Mar, the SQ/CC flew him with an IP on his first few sorties
       in order to regain his landing, AAR, LOWAT, and Formation Takeoff (T/O) and Landing curren-
       cies.
       4.11.1.4. At the end of the training cycle on 30 Jun, the SQ/CC prorated 2 months off of Capt
       Smith's total requirements. In spite of this proration, Capt Smith was deficient in one RAP sortie
       category The SQ/CC could regress Capt Smith to N-CMR, if deemed significant. After accom-
       plishing the tailored re-certification program (the deficient sorties), the SQ/CC would re-certify
       Capt Smith to CMR. This training counts for the new training cycle.

4.12. Instruments. Develop an instrument training program to ensure instrument proficiency including
lost wingman training, briefings on how to recognize and deal with spatial disorientation, HUD-off
unusual attitude recoveries, and transition from visual to instrument conditions. It will also stress the use
of primary flight instrument (HUD) and standby flight group instruments during instrument recovery
from unusual attitudes or spatial disorientation.
   4.12.1. Units which seldom encounter bad weather and/or night recoveries should exercise pilot and
   approach facilities by periodically simulating "weather day" recovery operations, as determined by
   the SQ/CC.
42                                                                        AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006


     4.12.2. Pilots transferring from another theater require the theater-specific portions of IRC before fly-
     ing. MQT that include theater-specific portions of IRC academics and the MQT LAO mission may
     satisfy this requirement.
     4.12.3. Pilots may accomplish RAP events on an instrument sortie provided accomplishment does not
     interfere with the primary goal of instrument training. Pilots should practice the transition from instru-
     ments to visual references on all instrument approaches. Instrument sorties are Non-RAP require-
     ments and will be logged as such. Units are allocated sorties for every pilot to accomplish their
     minimum Non-RAP requirements.
     4.12.4. Pilots will accomplish spatial disorientation events in the FMT per Table 4.2..

4.13. G-Awareness Continuation Training.
Units will develop a CT program that provides feedback to pilots and imprints a proper AGSM so that it
becomes an integral part of pulling Gs.
     4.13.1. The basis of this program is to give each FL, SQ supervisor, aerospace physiologist and flight
     surgeon the skills needed to evaluate a flight member's DVR to ensure a proper AGSM is being per-
     formed. This program also makes assessment of the AGSM a normal debrief item after every flight.
     The assessment should be done as a normal part of DVR assessment while reviewing other tactical
     portions of the mission.
     4.13.2. Use the following minimum guidance to implement the unit's program:
        4.13.2.1. Incorporate AGSM technique and assessment into FLUG, IPUG, and squadron CT pro-
        gram. Place emphasis on briefing, debriefing, and assessing the AGSM using the DVR in the
        debrief on a daily basis. FLs, IPs, SQ supervisors, Aerospace Physiologists and flight surgeons
        should become adept at assessing and teaching the correct AGSM. The approved instructional
        video covering AGSM technique, reinforcement, and assessment, or Anti-G strain technique ace-
        ademics will be presented annually by a qualified physiologists, flight surgeon, or IP squadron
        supervisor to all pilots as part of weapons academics. Academics will include a discussion of the
        limitations imposed on aircraft performance as a result of an ineffective AGSM.
        4.13.2.2. Units will include "AGSM effectiveness" on MQT and "AGSM assessment" on FLUG
        and IPUG grade sheets. Evaluate these areas during sorties where more than five Gs are pulled.
        4.13.2.3. Fly the tactical portion of all basic missions in hot mic to enable assessment of the
        AGSM. Set intercom volumes at a level which is comfortable for the pilot but still allows assess-
        ment of breathing and AGSM technique in the debrief For high task sorties it is highly desired for
        pilots to fly in hot mic. The purpose of this is to identify breakdowns in the AGSM which com-
        monly occur during high task portions of a mission.
        4.13.2.4. Film G-awareness exercises in hot mic. The second turn of the G-awareness exercise
        will be a minimum of 180 degrees of turn.
        4.13.2.5. FLs will emphasize G-awareness when appropriate during the flight briefing.
        4.13.2.6. FLs will assess the AGSM effectiveness of flight members during mission debriefings.
        This assessment should not be limited to the G-awareness exercise. Evaluate the AGSM after the
        pilot has had the time to fatigue, to get an accurate assessment of a pilot's AGSM during a tacti-
AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006                                                                               43


      cally and G-demanding portion of flight. AGSM should also be evaluated under relatively low
      intensity G.
   4.13.3. FLs or SQ supervisors will identify pilots having poor AGSM technique or low G-tolerance to
   the Flt/CC or appropriate operations supervisor. The SQ/DO or appropriate operations supervisor will
   determine what action is required to improve the pilot's G-tolerance. The SQ/CC will determine if
   Commander-Directed Acceleration Training is required IAW AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for
   High-G Aircrew.
   4.13.4. The squadron will develop a program to ensure an A/A mission tape for each pilot is reviewed
   each training cycle by an aerospace physiologist or squadron flight surgeon and documented. A
   squadron supervisor will review the documentation. If an aerospace physiologist or squadron flight
   surgeon are not available, a squadron supervisor will review the tape and document appropriately.

4.14. Low/Slow Speed EID/VID Procedures:
   4.14.1. For units specifically tasked to perform the Homeland Security mission or counter drug role,
   comply with current approved guidance.
   4.14.2. For all other units, the objective of this low/slow EID/VID training is to expose pilots to prob-
   lems associated with intercepting low/slow flying aircraft (rotary and fixed wing) for visual identifica-
   tion practice in a threat environment. Emphasis should be placed on dissimilar adversaries below 2000
   feet AGL and 200 KIAS (helicopters are desired). Training will be conducted IAW AFTTP 3-1, AFI
   11-2F-22AV3, and AFI 11-214.
      4.14.2.1. Unit developed ground training programs will be designed for unit specific equipage
      and employment taskings. Academic sessions should be conducted during weapons and tactics
      training and maximum use of the visual recognition program is encouraged.
      4.14.2.2. Flying training missions should, to the maximum extent possible, include USAF heli-
      copters, USN helicopters, USA helicopters, and propeller aircraft. Creation of a realistic environ-
      ment to stimulate the aircraft EID/VID suite is essential to the conduct of low/slow VID
      procedures. Units must make every effort to maximize effective use of limited assets as well as to
      instill awareness and actions appropriate to this training. SQ/CC's will determine the depth of
      ground and flying training necessary prior to participating in exercises and contingency opera-
      tions.

                                                  Chapter 5

                            WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT QUALIFICATION

5.1. General. This chapter outlines requirements for the initial qualification to employ weapons
(AIM-120, AIM-9, GUN and GBU-32) and the requirements to maintain qualification in weapons
employment during Continuation Training. Refer to Attachment 2 for further guidance in weapons
events.

5.2. Initial Qualification:
     5.2.1. Pilots must accomplish initial qualification in any weapons event requiring qualification at
     CMR/BMC. Initial qualification achieved in IQT or MQT satisfies requirements for CT initial quali-
     fication, but not for CT event requirements. Initial qualification will carry over for consecutive tours
     in the F-22A. Initial missile employment qualification is evaluated on the mission qualification check
     ride and is achieved by meeting the "qualified" criteria for weapons employment IAW AFI
     11-2F-22AV2. Qualification in one missile category is assumed for other missile categories in such
     cases where only one type of missile was employed.
     5.2.2. Initial gun employment qualification is achieved by scoring an individual hit during a live fire
     pass on a AGTS/Banner (as applicable) target. A hit is one bullet impact on the AGTS/Banner (as
     applicable). For initial qualification use any Banner pattern as defined in (AFI 11-214). If AGTS/Ban-
     ner (as applicable) are not available, gun qualification may be accomplished via DVR assessment.
     5.2.3. If not otherwise specified, initial qualification in a weapons event is satisfied when the pilot has
     achieved a minimum of 3 hits out of 6 consecutive record deliveries. Scoring shall be accomplished
     by ground, air, or DVR scoring as approprate.
     5.2.4. The initial qualification satisfies weapons qualification requirements until the end of the cur-
     rent training period.

5.3. CT Qualification:
     5.3.1. During CT each pilot's weapons employment will be assessed for validity IAW AFTTP 3-1 cri-
     teria and the results in each category (AIM-120, AIM-9, GUN and GBU-32) will be recorded for the
     current training period for RAP required tasks. Qualification in weapons employment is maintained
     by achieving a 75 percent valid at pickle rate for AIM-120/9 and 75 percent valid attempt at trigger
     squeeze for gun. This qualification is valid throughout the next training period.
     5.3.2. To maintain AGTS/Banner (as applicable) qualification, pilots will use basic or tactical patterns
     as defined in AFI 11-214 and must achieve a hit.
     5.3.3. Unless otherwise specified, GBU-32 qualification criteria is 20 record hits and an overall
     record hit rate of 85 percent.

5.4. Failure to Qualify:
     5.4.1. If qualification is required at CMR/BMC, failure to qualify will result in regression to N-CMR/
     N-BMC and entered into re-certification until re-qualification is accomplished.
AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006                                                                               45


   5.4.2. AGTS/Banner (as applicable) re-qualification requires an individual hit IAW hit criteria in
   paragraph 5.3. above. Re-qualification may be accomplished using basic or tactical patterns. If AGTS/
   Banner (as applicable) are not available, gun re-qualification may be accomplished via DVR assess-
   ment.
   5.4.3. SQ/CC will determine the corrective action required to re-qualify a pilot in those categories in
   which the pilot failed to meet standards.

5.5. Weapons Employment Parameters. The following employment parameters and requirements
form the basic frame work for aircrew weapons employment training and all deliveries will conform to
limits established for each specific event.
   5.5.1. Missile employment parameters must be IAW AFTTP 3-1 criteria.
   5.5.2. Gun employment parameters must be IAW AFTTP 3-1 criteria.
       5.5.2.1. Gun pattern descriptions, procedures, training rules, and foul criteria are contained in AFI
       11-2F-22AV3 and AFI 11-214 as supplemented.
       5.5.2.2. GBU-32 employment using aircraft systems to determine release point for delivery on the
       target. Delivery of ordinance, actual or training, is not required. Minimum recovery is safe escape
       for the ordinance being delivered or simulated.
       5.5.2.3. Hit criteria:
           5.5.2.3.1. AGTS/Banner (as applicable). One bullet impact is required.
           5.5.2.3.2. During live-fire gun employment on an AGTS/Banner target with an inoperative
           scoring system a hit can be declared if DVR assessment shows that the firing parameters met
           AFTTP 3-1 hit criteria and the gun was fired. A hit may not be declared if the shot is
           non-assessable.
           5.5.2.3.3. During live-fire gun employment failure to qualify during hot passes will not be
           reversed by DVR assessed hit on cold passes.
           5.5.2.3.4. Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM). Hit criteria for JDAM delivery profiles is
           IAW AFTTP 3-1.

5.6. Live Ordnance. Live ordnance training is essential to pilot combat capability. Every attempt should
be made to give each pilot the opportunity to employ as many types of weapons inventoried on the unit's
UCML as possible. To provide this opportunity, as a goal, all CMR pilots should expend the following
ordnance. (AFI 36-2217, Munitions Requirements for Aircrew Training)
   5.6.1. For units tasked with DCA, Strategic Defense, and/or OCA missions: One live A/A missile
   employment per training cycle.
   5.6.2. Two GBU-32 live or inert sortie per training cycle-minimum.
46                                                                      AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006


                                                Chapter 6

                                      SPECIALIZED TRAINING

6.1. Specialized Training Programs. This chapter outlines upgrade training programs for special capa-
bilities and qualifications. These programs are intended to provide a basic starting point and may be mod-
ified by the SQ/CC based on the unit's requirements and/or the upgradee's previous experience,
qualifications, and documented performance. Unless governed by a formal syllabus, ground and device
training for these programs will consist of unit-developed academics and scenarios. Flight training will be
conducted in accordance with a program approved by the SQ/CC.

6.2. Simulator Instructor (SI). The following mission profiles should be used to train and qualify
selected simulator instructors to operate the IOS. The contractor simulator instructor program will be
IAW the appropriate contract. SQ/CCs will determine the number of SIs required to perform the unit mis-
sion. The required supervision for this upgrade program is an IOS qualified/current instructor.
     6.2.1. Academic Training. Prior to the first IOS mission, the upgrading simulator instructor (USI)
     will complete the following unit developed blocks of instruction:
        6.2.1.1. Principles of Instruction. Learning objectives, instructor responsibilities, instructor
        relationship, training facilities, and publications.
        6.2.1.2. Techniques of Fight Instruction. Training objectives and environment; maneuver dem-
        onstration, performance, and review; recognition and analysis of common errors.
        6.2.1.3. Conduct of Flight Briefing. Training objectives, order of presentation, use of briefing
        guides and audiovisual aids, debriefing techniques.
        6.2.1.4. Conduct of Phase Briefings. Techniques for briefing, use of visual aids, review of appli-
        cable briefings.
        6.2.1.5. Evaluations. Grading systems and preparation/use of gradesheets.
     6.2.2. Mission Profiles (Based on Simulator Capabilities):
        6.2.2.1. SI-1, IOS Operations. Mission initialization, page review and modification, keyboard
        operation, light pen operation, emergency shutdown, record/playback, hard copy, performance,
        and procedures monitoring.
        6.2.2.2. SI-2, IOS Operations. TES file, console-operated air intercepts and options, A/A weap-
        ons scoring, ground threats and modifications, air to surface weapons scoring, surface-to-air
        engagement scoring, program and simulator freeze, mission parameter modifications.
        6.2.2.3. SI-3, Practical Exercise. The USI will conduct a regularly scheduled simulator mission
        from the IOS under supervision of an IOS-qualified instructor.
     6.2.3. Following successful completion of SI-3, the SQ/CC will certify the pilot's SI status in appro-
     priate written format (memorandum, ARMS, gradesheet, etc.).

6.3. Flight Lead Upgrade. SQ/CCs will select only highly qualified, motivated, and responsible pilots
for this program. Initial entry may be as a 2-ship/element FL until experience and proficiency warrant fur-
ther progression, in which case, responsibilities for employment will not exceed 2 aircraft until certified
AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006                                                                             47


as a 4-ship FL. The SQ/CC will determine when a 2-ship FL may train toward larger, more complex for-
mations (3 or 4-ship, mission commander, etc.). FL training should place appropriate emphasis on 4-ship
tactical employment. Units will determine the level of Simluator training required to support FLUG
upgrades.
   6.3.1. The following minimum flying hours are required prior to entering FL upgrade training:
       6.3.1.1. 300 hours PAI, or
       6.3.1.2. 400 hours IP/MP/FP in an 11Fxx/11K3C/11K3D AFSC of which 200 hours are PAI, or
       6.3.1.3. 50 hours PAI, if previously qualified air-to-air radar equipped 11Fxx AFSC flight lead.
       6.3.1.4. For converting units, SQ/CCs may select prior qualified flight leads in a radar equipped
       fighter MDS to upgrade to flight lead concurrently with the MQT top-off program regardless of
       PAA hours.
   6.3.2. Ground training will consist of locally developed instruction in the following areas:
       6.3.2.1. FL Responsibilities. FL/wingman relationship, unit training objectives.
       6.3.2.2. Mission Preparation. Mission objectives, wingman requirements and responsibilities,
       currencies, capabilities, delegation of mission planning duties, and briefing preparation.

       audiovisual aids, flight member involvement, briefing techniques, debriefing/questioning tech-
       niques, tape review responsibilities and procedures.
       6.3.2.4. Conduct of Missions. Control of flight, flight discipline, emergency procedures, training
       rules, and responsibilities to SQ/CC.
       6.3.2.5. AGSM Techniques. Briefing, debriefing, and DVR assessment. Review the video,
       “Anti-G Strain Technique Reinforcement and Assessment.” See paragraph 4.14.
       6.3.2.6. IFEs and Emergency Diverts.
   6.3.3. Flight training will be conducted in accordance with a program approved by the SQ/CC. The
   following is a recommended baseline program which may be modified as necessary to meet unit and/
   or upgradee specific needs. Missions may be flown in any order provided day training precedes
   respective night training. SQ/CCs will determine which sorties are required based on a review of pre-
   vious experience and may certify a flight lead with appropriate restrictions based on training not
   accomplished (i.e. AAR, etc.). Units will determine the level of Simluator training required to support
   FLUG upgrades. An evaluation sortie is required. A day and night aerial refueling, and a trail recovery
   will be accomplished as a flight lead during the program. DVR review/assessment, to include a review
   of AGSM, will be accomplished on every sortie. All FLUG training will be under the supervision of
   an IP or flight lead-qualified squadron supervisor. Dissimilar adversaries should be used to the maxi-
   mum extent practical during FLUG training. 4-ship FL upgrade program is at the SQ/CC discretion.
   (NOTE: If 2- and 4-ship upgrade training are combined, only one evaluation sortie is required.)
       6.3.3.1. FLUG-1--AHC/Basic Unopposed SAT/DAAR. Mission Objectives: Demonstrate pro-

     6.4.3. Flying Training. Training will be conducted according to mission outlines listed below in any
     order, as sortie scheduling permits. Units will determine the level of Simulator training required to
     support IPUG upgrades. Unit programs should specify which tasks the UIP will practice demonstrat-
     ing, which tasks the UIP will practice evaluating the "student's" performance, and which tasks he will
     do both. IPUG programs for pilots with previous fighter experience may be individually tailored,
     based on experience, currency, and documented performance. AAR may be completed on any mis-
     sion. Failure to complete specific training events (e.g., AAR) need not delay certification. In such

        joint/composite force employment packages in Global Strike and/or Global Persistant Attack mis-
        sions. Mission commanders, once certified, are authorized to lead joint/composite force missions.
        6.5.1.2. MCCs may delegate authority and responsibility for a portion of the mission to a second-
        ary MCC. For example, a MCC flying in an Air-to-Surface (A/S) weapons system may designate
        a MCC in an A/A weapons system to be in charge of the A/A portion of the mission.
     6.5.2. MCC Prerequisites. Squadron commanders will consider ability, judgment, technical exper-
     tise, skill, and experience when selecting a pilot for mission commander upgrade.
        6.5.2.1. Minimum qualification is 4-ship FL.

     the planning, briefing, flight, and debriefing of at least one composite force mission. Prior to certifica-
     tion, the upgrading MCC will then plan, brief, fly a simulator mission, and debrief a minimum of one
     simulator mission under the supervision of an IP or Squadron Supervisor who is MCC qualified. This
     program establishes the minimum guidelines for upgrade to MCC.
        6.5.4.1. To qualify as a MCC simulator, the pilot must be acting as the Mission Commander for a
        joint/composite mission responsible for two or more types of aircraft with four or more total air-
        craft or more than four own MDS aircraft versus a minimum of two pre-planned adversary air-
        craft. The scenario will be a Global Strike and/or Global Persistant Attack mission. Unit tasking
        should drive force composition.

active air defense alert missions will complete this training. Training will be coordinated through the
squadron training officer, unit intelligence section, and photo lab personnel, and is required prior to being
scheduled for alert duty requiring use of the photographic equipment.
   6.6.1. Ground training will cover camera and attachment operation, intelligence gathering, photo-
   graphic techniques, MAJCOM/local restrictions on the use of cameras by assigned pilot and/or in
   assigned aircraft, and hands-on cockpit training.
   6.6.2. Conduct flying training IAW unit-developed mission profiles which allow this training in con-
   junction with other approved training.
   6.6.3. Photo aircraft will approach no closer than 100 feet to aircraft being photographed during train-
   ing.

   training as specified in paragraphs 6.7.1. and 6.7.2.

6.7. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Qualification Program. The intent of this program is to produce fully
qualified wingmen, flight leads, and instructor pilots. Completion of the qualification training allows the
pilot to perform missions under NVGs at or above minimum safe altitude (MSA) or IAW AFI 11-214,
whichever is greater. Operation below MSA will require additional training as determined by OG/CC.
   6.7.1. Ground Training. Upgrading NVG pilots must satisfactorily complete the following require-
   ments prior to NVG-1.
       6.7.1.1. Academics.
           6.7.1.1.1. Academic instruction will include NVG academics and an NVG Phase Brief. Each
           Squadron Commander will designate a “core” NVG academic instructor. This instructor may
           certify additional instrutors within the Squadron and Operations Group.
           6.7.1.1.2. Units will designate highly experienced NVG IPs to conduct local academic train-
           ing, and will use MAJCOM approved courseware. For local academics, NVG instructional
           videos will be used to demonstrate NVG visual illusions in place of the terrain board.
           6.7.1.1.3. Academics will be accomplished within 60 days prior to accomplishing NVG-1. If
           more than 60 days elapse prior to NVG-1, pilots must review the NVG academics. If more
           than 180 days elapse between completion of NVG academics and NVG-1, pilots must
           re-accomplish NVG academics.

     6.7.4. OG/CCs are responsible for ensuring all participating pilots are ready to deploy and are profi-
     cient to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking.

6.8. Contingency/Exercise Spin-up Training. This training will be conducted prior to support of con-
tingency operations (if time permits) or exercises. The objective of this training is to ensure the pilot's
ability to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking. For contingency operations, units are
responsible for contacting appropriate gaining command/operations to determine expected mission task-
ings. For exercises, units are responsible for referring to appropriate EXPLANS and contacting appropri-
ate exercise POCs prior to deployment to determine expected mission taskings. These EXPLANS include
COMACC EXPLANS 80 for Red, Green, Maple, and Coalition Flags, EXPLANS 323 for Air Warrior 1,
and EXPLANS 163 for Air Warrior 2. This assures the units are prepared for the appropriate tasking and
allows the responding OG/CC to tailor this training for the theater, threat, and tactics for the assigned task.
The SQ/CC is then responsible for implementation of this spin-up, prosecuting the required missions, and
determining the specific requirements necessary to reach the desired level of proficiency. Emphasis will
be placed on training needed for missions not accomplished in daily operations. This training will be con-
ducted IAW all applicable instructions.
     6.8.1. If a pilot is not assigned to the tasked squadron, they must receive spin-up training as deter-
     mined by the tasked SQ/CC. This applies to all attached pilots (OG/WG/HQ staffs, etc.), and all pilots
     augmenting from other squadrons (operational, FTU, weapons school, test, etc.). The objective of this
     training is to ensure attached/augmenting pilot is proficient to conduct all missions in support of
     expected tasking. The deploying SQ/CC will determine the amount of spin-up training required for
     each attached/augmenting pilot based on the pilot's level of proficiency, currency, qualification, expe-
     rience, etc. For augmenting pilots, once the amount of spin-up training is determined, the augmentee's
     SQ/CC is responsible for ensuring the spin-up training is accomplished.
     6.8.2. Ground Training. All applicable pilots will complete ground training as necessary prior to
     their support of contingency operations or exercises.
        6.8.2.1. Academics. Units will brief exercise SPINS, ROE/Training Rules, command and con-
        trol, engagement authority and procedures, and visual identification. MAJCOM/IN will assist the
        unit's intelligence functions in the development of threat assessments and visual recognition train-
        ing materials.
        6.8.2.2. Visual Recognition. Pilots must be able to visually identify aircraft (rotary and
        fixed-wing, including joint/allied assets) they are likely to encounter by name or numerical desig-
        nator and determine whether the aircraft is a threat or non-threat (training should incorporate all
        aspects/angles, theater-specific paint schemes/fin flashes, and various configurations), identify
        ground equipment, and determine major categories of naval vessels.
     6.8.3. Flying Training. Tailor spin-up training to ensure all supporting pilots are proficient, current,
     and qualified in all expected mission taskings.

Terms
Air Combat Training (ACBT)—A general term which includes (D)BFM, (D)WVR, and (D)ACT. The
prefix (D) refers to dissimilar assets. When present, dissimilar is optional. When the prefix is missing,
similar is assumed as flown/required. When present without parenthesis, dissimilar is assumed flown or
required. This convention corresponds to all facets of ACBT (i.e., BFM, ACM, ACT).
Air Combat Tactics (ACT)—Training in the application of BFM, WVR, and tactical intercept skills to
achieve a tactical air-to-air objective. (AFI 11-214)
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—The status of an aircrew who has satisfactorily completed training
(MQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational missions but does not
maintain CMR status. Aircrew accomplishes training required to remain familiarized in all, and may be
qualified and proficient in some, of the core missions of their weapon system and unit. These aircrew
members may also maintain special capabilities. (Refer to paragraph 4.3.)
Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ)—A status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed
training prescribed to maintain the skills necessary to fly the unit aircraft. The member must perform at
the minimum frequency necessary to meet the most recent sortie and flight standards set for the weapons
system. BAQ will only be carried by aircrew until completion of MQT. BAQ is not a permanent
qualification except for General Officers above the wing level, and any other crew members specifically
authorized by MAJCOM A3. Aircrews are not authorized to perform RAP-tasked combat event/sorties
without instructor aircrew or SQ supervisor supervision. Flight duties will be limited to those identified in
AFI11-2F-22AV1 19 MAY 2006                                                                                69


paragraph 4.3.
Certification—The process of certifying aircrew tactical employment and special weapons capabilities,
procedures, and rules. Replaces verification for nuclear tasked units.
Combat Edge (CE)—A positive-pressure breathing-for-G (PPG) system which provides pilots
additional protection against high positive G accelerations experienced during flight. The system consists
of aircrew equipment (high-pressure mask, counter-pressure suit, G-suit), and aircraft equipment (oxygen
regulator, G-valve, and interfacing sense line). At 5-G and above, regulated air and oxygen are supplied to
the system to provide automatic mask tensioning, vest inflation, and positive pressure breathing to the
mask.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—A status of an aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed
training (MQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational missions, and
maintains qualification and proficiency in these missions. All active duty API -1/2's, Squadron
Commander, Operations Officers, and OG/CC designated API -6 manning positions are required to
maintain this qualification level. EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, they may elect to train the front
line of their UMD to CMR with the overage designated as BMC. Approximately 50% of the aircrew
selected for CMR must be inexperienced. (Refer to paragraph 4.3.)
Composite Force Training (CFTR)—Scenarios employing multiple flights of the same or different
types of aircraft, each under the direction of its own flight leader, performing the same or different roles.
(AFI 11-214)
Continuation Training (CT)—Training to maintain proficiency and improve aircrew capabilities to
perform unit missions and aircrew proficiency sorties not flown in formal syllabus missions, tests, or
evaluations. Applicable to CMR and BMC aircrew.

                  GLOSSARY OF MISSION/SORTIE AND EVENT DEFINITIONS

A2.1. Mission/Sortie Definitions.
     A2.1.1. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC). Basic skills sortie. Training for proficiency in
     utilization and exploitation of the aircraft flight envelope, consistent with operational and safety con-
     straints, including, but not limited to low speed high AOA maneuvering, high G, high speed, high alti-
     tude AHC, energy management, maximum/optimum acceleration and deceleration techniques, and
     confidence maneuvers.
     A2.1.2. Attrition Sortie. A sortie planned and launched as a RAP training sortie, Non-RAP sortie, or
     collateral sortie, that, due to some circumstance (weather, IFE, maintenance, etc.), fails to accomplish
     the planned mission. It is imperative that units log these sorties properly as non-effective. Improper
     accounting of these sorties will result in improper sortie allocation, stresses to the unit schedule, and
     negative impacts to the quality of unit training programs.
     A2.1.3. Basic Fighter Maneuvers/Within Visual Range Maneuvers (BFM/WVR). B u i l d i n g
     block sorties. BFM (1 v 1) Training designed to apply aircraft handling skills to gain proficiency in
     recognizing and solving range, closure, aspect, angle off, and turning room problems in relation to
     another aircraft to either attain a position from which weapons may be launched, or defeat weapons
     employed by an adversary. WVR (2 v X or 1 v X) Training is designed to prioritize flow priorities and
     signature management to achieve proficiency in element and single-ship maneuvering and the coordi-
     nated application of BFM to achieve a simulated kill or effectively defend against one or more aircraft
     from a pre-planned starting position.
     A2.1.4. Collateral Sorties. Sorties not directly related to combat employment or basic skills training
     but necessary for accomplishment of unit missions. These include ferry flights, deployments, FCF
     flights, flights, airshows, etc. These sorties are not required for RAP training purposes.
     A2.1.5. Commander Option Sortie. A sortie that may be used to provide individualized training
     based on proficiency and demonstrated performance. This sortie may be allocated above the guide-
     lines in the RAP tasking memo for all mission types (Except CMR Red Air). The intent is to use these
     missions as necessary throughout the training cycle, rather than allocating them at the beginning of the
     training cycle.
     A2.1.6. Contingency Sortie. A mission tasked and flown while deployed for a contingency opera-
     tion in which training is limited. These sorties are logged as Contingency Operations Sortie (SC13) in
     ARMS. These sorties and events accomplished on the sorties do not count towards RAP requirements
     however, the sorties may be used for lookback and the events to update currencies.
     A2.1.7. Defensive Counter Air (DCA). Mission sortie designed to develop proficiency in DCA
     mission tactics. Mission elements include: Intel scenario and mission planning, execution of tactics to
     detect, engage, and negate aircraft employing adversary tactics and weapons capabilities to penetrate
     protected airspace or attack a specific target area, and in-flight report. Empahsis on signature manage-
     ment and flow priorities.
     A2.1.8. Demanding Sortie. Sorties that task the pilot to the extent that flying frequency and continu-
     ity are most critical. Authorized sorties/events requiring demanding mission currency are: BFM,
     (D)WVR, (D)ACT, LOWAT (below 1,000 feet AGL), SQ/CCs may add sorties/events to the demand-

  ing sortie list, depending on unit tasking and the individual's capabilities. Also see Non-demanding
  Sortie.
  A2.1.9. 4-Ship Flight Lead (4FL ) Sortie. Special qualification sortie. Sortie where FL leads a
  flight of 4 or more. May be logged in conjunction with baseline training requirements. Aircraft attri-
  tion to 3- ship employment may count.
  A2.1.10. Force Protection/OCA- Escort. Mission sortie designed to develop proficiency in force
  protection tactics. Mission elements include: Intel scenario and integrated mission planning to support
  force package objectives to include Low Observable (LO) and non-LO assets, execution of tactics to
  detect and negate threats employing adversary tactics and weapons capabilities to disrupt force pack-
  age employment/destroy package assets, with emphasis on signature management and flow prioirties,
  and in-flight report.
  A2.1.11. HVAA Protection. Mission sortie designed to develop proficiency in protecting a high
  value airborne asset. Mission elements include: Intel scenario and integrated mission planning to High
  Value Airborne Asset (HVAA) objectives, execution of tactics with emphasis on signature manage-
  ment and flow priorites to detect and negate threats employing adversary tactics and weapons capabil-
  ities to disrupt/destroy employment or the asset, and in-flight report.
  A2.1.12. Instructor Pilot (IP) Sortie. Special qualification sortie. Sortie where IP acted in the
  capacity of an instructor. IPs/supervisors will log an IP sortie when acting in that capacity on a build-
  ing block MQT sortie (BFM, WVR, Tactical Intercepts including basic SAT), IPUG missions, or on
  any sortie where IP duties preclude effective combat mission training. On other sorties, IPs may log a
  rap mission sortie if quality training was obtained for the instructor. May be logged by evaluators on
  check rides if the above conditions apply. Will not be dual-logged with other RAP sorties.
  A2.1.13. Instrument Sortie. Basic skills sortie. Training designed to ensure instrument proficiency.
  RAP events may be accomplished on an instrument sortie provided accomplishment does not interfere
  with the primary goal of instrument training. Units are allocated sorties for every aircrew to accom-
  plish their minimum basic skill, Non-RAP, requirements.
  A2.1.14. Mission Commander (MCC) Sortie. Special qualification sortie. Sortie where aircrew
  acted in the capacity of a MCC for a joint/composite mission responsible for two or more types of air-
  craft with four or more total aircraft, or more than four own MDS aircraft versus a minimum of two
  pre-planned adversary aircraft. May be logged in FMT and in conjunction with baseline training
  requirements.
  A2.1.15. Night Sortie. Sortie on which either takeoff or landing and at least 50 percent of flight dura-
  tion or 1 hour, whichever is less, occur between the end of evening twilight and the beginning of
  morning civil twilight, as published in the American Air Almanac, converted to local time. May be
  dual logged with baseline BMC/CMR training requirements
  A2.1.16. Non-demanding Sortie. A day sortie that provides the aircrew with the opportunity to
  regain basic flying proficiency without excessively tasking those skills that have been under used dur-
  ing the non-flying period. Authorized sorties/events flown for/on a non-demanding sortie are: instru-
  ments, AHC, low level navigation at or above 500 feet AGL, basic weapons delivery, basic intercepts,
  etc. SQ/CCs may delete sorties/events from this non-demanding sortie list, depending on unit tasking
  and the individual's capabilities.

        A2.1.16.1. Non Demanding NVG Event. Any NVG sortie that accomplishes items in paragraph
        4.6.7.
     A2.1.17. Red Air Sortie. A/A sortie where tactics, aircraft simulation, weapon systems, and/or
     maneuvering is limited to the extent that complete own MDS training is not accomplished. Restric-
     tions which limit aircraft capabilities to some level which might be encountered in combat do not
     require logging the sortie as Red Air. Red Air sortie allocations in the tasking message are a maximum
     cap on degraded training. Unused Red Air allocations should be flown in one of the other A/A training
     mission categories.
     A2.1.18. Sweep. Mission sortie designed to develop proficiency in OCA sweep tactics. Mission ele-
     ments include: Intel scenario and tactical mission planning, execution of tactics designed to empaha-
     size signature management, and flow priorities, detect, engage, and negate simulated adversary
     aircraft which are operating within specific commit criteria (i.e. range, airspace corridor, vul time,
     etc), and in-flight report.

A2.2. Event Definitions:
     A2.2.1. Unless otherwise specified in these event descriptions, units will determine the necessary
     parameters for fulfilling and/or logging tasked events. Event is defined in one of the following man-
     ners:
     A2.2.2. A specific type of weapon delivery (defined by aircraft flight path, ordnance delivered, deliv-
     ery method, or target struck) performed during a sortie.
     A2.2.3. Expending of ordnance against a target according to predetermined flight path parameters
     and delivery methods. A single delivery constitutes an event except for strafe and, which require sat-
     isfaction of additional criteria.
     A2.2.4. Accomplishment of a specific training element, function, or task (i.e., formation, AAR, CAS,
     etc.)

A2.3. Weapons Delivery Events.
     A2.3.1. RAP Tasking:

        qualification level. Unless otherwise specified in the RAP tasking memo or formal course syllabi,
        FAM tasking normally requires three AGTS/Banner (as applicable) firing pass to be completed
        during the 20-month cycle.
        A2.3.1.2. Qualification QUAL. QUAL tasking demonstrates the pilot's capability to put appro-
        priate ordnance on target. Unless otherwise specified in the RAP tasking memo or formal course
        syllabi, QUAL criteria is established for each event in Chapter 5.
     A2.3.2. Miscellaneous Weapons Delivery Definitions to be Considered for Event Descriptions:
        A2.3.2.1. Dry Pass. Weapons delivery pass during which no ordnance is expended.
        A2.3.2.2. Foul. A penalty directed to a specific aircraft and crew for actions inconsistent with
        established procedures or safety considerations. A second foul or any dangerous pass will result in
        mandatory expulsion from any further deliveries during that mission. A foul will be charged IAW
        flying directive publications.
