This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive 51-7, International Law, and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), Article XI and Article XII. It estab-
lishes prohibitions for disposal of personal property acquired free of foreign customs taxes or import
duties and provides for disciplinary and administrative action. Failure to observe prohibitions and manda-
tory provisions of this directive in paragraph 2. and its subordinate clauses by military personnel is a vio-
lation of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Violations by civilian employees may
result in administrative disciplinary actions without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanc-
tions for violations of related laws. This instruction applies to all Air Force military personnel, Air Force
Reserve and Air National Guard, Department of the Air Force civilian employees, and dependents of both
military and civilian personnel, who are authorized to import, purchase, acquire or possess personal prop-
erty under an exemption from foreign customs taxes and import duties. Maintain and dispose of records
created as a result of prescribed processes in accordance with Air Force Manual 37-139, Records Dispo-
sition Schedule.

tion; it updates paragraph 2. and deletes paragraph 3. Revisions are indicated by a vertical bar [|] in the left
