                                                Chapter 2

                                                POLICIES

2.1. Clearance and Sensitive Position Standard. The personnel security standard that must be applied
to determine whether a person is eligible for access to classified information or assignment to sensitive
duties is whether, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness
are such that entrusting the person with classified information or assigning the person to sensitive duties
is clearly consistent with the interest of national security.

2.2. Military Service Standard. See AFPD 36-29, Military Standards and AFPD 36-20, Accession of
Air Force Military Personnel. It provides policies to ensure the Air Force employs the right quantity and
quality of people in the Air Force.

2.3. Criteria for Application of Security Standards . The criteria for determining eligibility for a secu-
rity clearance are listed in DOD 5200.2-R, para 2-200. Commanders apply the criteria for security stan-
dards when granting access to classified information.

2.4. Types and Scope of Personnel Security Investigations. The scope of each type of personnel secu-
rity investigation is listed in DoD 5200.2-R, Appendix B. See Attachment 2 for procedures on requesting
personnel security investigations (PSI). See Attachment 3 for guidance on the types of required person-
nel security investigations and appropriate questionnaire forms and or Electronic Personnel Security
Questionnaire (EPSQ) Software.
2.4. (AETC) Types and Scope of Personnel Security Investigations. Authorized requestors will utilize
electronic questionnaire for investigative processing (e-QIP) for submitting security clearance investiga-
tions.
   2.4.1. General. The investigations listed in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R and this instruction are the only
   PSIs authorized. The Secretary of the Air Force and/or the Under Secretary of Defense, Intelligence
   must approve raising or lowering the scope of the authorized investigation.
   2.4.2. Entrance National Agency Check (ENTNAC). ENTNACS were replaced by the NACLC on 1
   Oct 99 for military accessions.
   2.4.3. National Agency Check (NAC). NACs are primarily used for positions of trust.
   2.4.4. National Agency Check Plus Written Inquiries and Credit Check (NACIC). NACICs are con-
   ducted by OPM and are required on all civilian employees entering government employment and
   assigned to nonsensitive positions.
   2.4.5. Access National Agency Check with Written Inquiries and Credit Check (ANACI). ANACIs
   are conducted by OPM and are required for civilian employees’ initial Secret security clearance or
   assignment to noncritical sensitive positions.
   2.4.6. National Agency Check, Local Agency Checks and Credit Check (NACLC). NACLCs are
   required for military access to Secret information.
   2.4.7. Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI). SSBIs are required for access to TOP
   SECRET, Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), special sensitive positions and for critical
   sensitive positions.
10                                                              AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007


     2.4.8. Periodic Reinvestigation (PR). PRs are investigations conducted at prescribed intervals for the
     purpose of updating a previously completed background investigation.
     2.4.9. Special Investigative Inquiry (SII). SIIs are used to prove or disprove allegations or new infor-
     mation concerning the security standards that arise after a person has been granted a security clear-
     ance.
     2.4.10. (Added-AETC) Phased Periodic Reinvestigation (PPR). Similar to the periodic reinvesti-
     gation (PR), the investigative agency may eliminate certain areas of the normal background check
     process when no information of a security concern is developed.

2.5. Authorized Personnel Security Investigation Provider. The Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) is the DoD Authorized Personnel Security Investigation Provider.

2.6. Allegations of Criminal Activity. Commanders refer possible criminal conduct to the supporting
Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) detachment.

2.7. Overseas Personnel Security Investigations. AFOSI personnel conduct the overseas portion of
personnel security investigations, augmented by Army, Navy, and State Department counterparts.

2.8. Limitations and Restrictions. A break in service of over 24 months invalidates an individual’s per-
sonnel security clearance eligibility.
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                            11


                                                 Chapter 3

                                       SECURITY CLEARANCE

3.1. Authority to Designate Sensitive Positions. Commanders with position designation authority
determine the security sensitivity of civilian positions. Each civilian employee is subject to an investiga-
tion depending on the sensitivity of the position to be occupied, except for reappointment when the break
in employment is less than 24 months.

3.2. Nonsensitive Positions.
   3.2.1. The servicing civilian personnel flight (CPF) processes the initial request for NACIC’s to OPM
   for civilians occupying nonsensitive positions, not requiring access to classified information. OPM
   forwards the investigation to the CAF. Suitability determinations for civilian government employment
   are made accordingly:
   3.2.1. (AETC) A National Agency Check with Written Inquiries and Credit Check (NACIC) is valid
   for access to SECRET material if it has not exceeded the 10-year scope for a PR and is reflected in the
   Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) as previously adjudicated to the SECRET eligibility
   level.
   3.2.2. The CAF forwards the completed investigation, OPM “Certificate of Investigation” and the
   OPM INV Form 79A, Report of Agency Adjudicative Action on OPM Personnel Investigations to the
   base servicing CPF.
   3.2.3. The CPF:
       3.2.3.1. Determines if the individual is deemed suitable for employment IAW 5 CFR
       731.201-202. Coordination and or consultation with the supervisor and or commander may be
       made.
       3.2.3.2. If employee is determined suitable, CPF signs off on the OPM Certificate of Investigation
       and the form is filed in the individual’s Official Personnel Folder (OPF) IAW AFI 36.114, Guide
       to Personnel Recordkeeping.
       3.2.3.3. If applicant is determined unsuitable, CPF fills out the OPM INV Form 79A, Report of
       Agency Adjudicative Action on OPM Personnel Investigations and coordinates with the
       employee’s supervisor and or commander. CPF forwards the OPM INV Form 79A to OPM.
           3.2.3.3.1. (Added-AETC) The Air Force Central Adjudication Facility (AFCAF) adjudicates
           NACI, NACIC, and NAC investigations as either “Favorable” or “No Determination Made.”
           If adjudicated “Favorable,” no further action is required; however, if the investigation is adju-
           dicated “No Determination Made,” the office of primary responsibility (OPR) performs a suit-
           ability determination.
           3.2.3.3.2. (Added-AETC) The unit security manager (USM) enters suitability determinations
           results for NACIC and NAC investigations into the JPAS.

3.3. Reassignment to a Noncritical Sensitive Position. If a civilian employee is subsequently selected
for a position requiring access to classified information and unescorted entry into restricted areas (noncrit-
12                                                               AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007


ical sensitive), security managers process the completed SF 86, Questionnaire for National Security
Positions, to security forces authorized requesters.
     3.3.1. Security Forces Authorized Requesters:
        3.3.1.1. Submit the SF 86 to OPM for an “Access NACI”. The address is: OPM-FIPC PO Box
        618, 1137 Branchton Road, Boyers, PA, 16018. OPM does not have the EPSQ, therefore requests
        must be sent in hard copy. Use the EPSQ at the unit, validate the EPSQ, and print the SF 86 for
        mailing. Contact the servicing CPF for any questions concerning Part 1 of the SF 86 or the OPM
        Agency Use Information Sheet. A fingerprint card is not required as the individual has already
        been the subject of a NACI or NACIC.

3.4. Reassignment to a Critical Sensitive Position. If, in the future, the individual is selected for a crit-
ical sensitive position, security managers process the request for investigation to the security forces autho-
rized requester who will submit an SF 86 requesting a SSBI in accordance with Attachment 2.

3.5. PRs for Critical Sensitive and Noncritical Sensitive Positions. The periodic reinvestigation
requirements apply to civilian employees in noncritical sensitive positions that require access to classified
information. The reinvestigation requirements apply to civilian employees in critical sensitive positions
whether or not they have access to classified information. See Attachment 3.

3.6. Pre-employment Waivers.
     3.6.1. Sensitive Positions. Commanders must ensure procedures for pre-appointment to sensitive
     positions preclude an uncleared person from having access to classified information.
     3.6.2. Noncritical Sensitive and Critical Sensitive Positions (3-204). The commander or staff agency
     chief (or designee) with position sensitivity determination authority prepares a waiver of pre-employ-
     ment investigation requirements when such action is necessary and in the national interest. See
     Attachment 6 for sample waiver memorandum. The memorandum is filed in the individual’s OPF
     IAW AFI 36-114, Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping.

3.7. Mobilization of DOD Civilian Retirees. MAJCOM commanders can waive the investigative
requirements for the mobilization of selected re-employed annuitants for temporary appointment when
the break in employment is greater than 24 months.

3.8. Military Appointment, Enlistment, and Induction. Personnel appointed, enlisted, or inducted to
the active or reserve forces of the Air Force must have a favorable personnel security investigation. See
Attachment 3.
     3.8.1. Clearance requirements for officer training school selectees are outlined in Air Force Instruc-
     tion (AFI) 36-2005, Appointment in Commissioned Grades and Designation and Assignment in Pro-
     fessional Categories.
     3.8.1. (AETC) Prior service selectees are instructed to complete all required clearance actions imme-
     diately upon notification of their selection to active duty.
     3.8.2. (Added-AETC) Security managers at accession sources ensure officer candidates complete
     memorandums to acknowledge understanding of involuntarily separation if their security clearance
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                          13


   eligibilities are not granted. The memorandums are maintained in student records until clearance eli-
   gibilities are favorably adjudicated.
   3.8.3. (Added-AETC) The Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS) processes all enlisted accessions
   for NACLC before recruits enter active duty. The Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) for-
   wards all required documents that include e-QIP, fingerprint cards, certification, and release forms to
   the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) before the recruit departs for basic training.
       3.8.3.1. (Added-AETC) The special investigative inquiry (SII) field in the JPAS database only
       verifies receipt of the electronic e-QIP, therefore, written or verbal verification from the OPM help
       desk or the Air Force OPM Liaison Office is necessary to verify OPM receipt of fingerprint cards,
       certification, and release forms. If verbal verification is received, a memorandum is included in
       the recruit’s folder indicating time, date, and name of person verifying receipt of the documents at
       OPM. The Air Force recruiter or MEPS representative who verified the information with OPM
       signs the memorandum.
   3.8.4. (Added-AETC) AETC training squadrons will notify HQ AETC/A7S through their respective
   numbered Air Force when students arrive for training without the required investigation being initi-
   ated. Notification will include the individual’s full name, social security number (SSN), AFSC (Air
   Force specialty code), and for new accessions, the commissioning source or recruiting detachment, as

the CAVS. Refer to AFI 31-406, Applying NATO Protection Standards.

3.23. Special Access Program. Certain programs require additional investigative and or safeguarding
requirements. Refer to AFI 16-701, The US Air Force Special Access Programs.

3.24. Processing Requests for Access to Restricted Areas, Sensitive Information or Equipment Not
Involving Access to Classified Information. Access for unescorted entry may be granted based on the
following investigative requirements. Refer to Attachment 3, Table A3.6.
   3.24.1. DOD and OPM civilians require a National Agency Check with Written Inquiries and Credit
   Check (NACIC).
   3.24.2. Air Reserve forces personnel with a current Entrance National Agency Check (ENTNAC) or
   NAC may have unescorted entry to restricted areas while in civilian status, pending completion of the
   required NACIC.
   3.24.3. Department of Energy employees require an “L” (Secret) clearance.
   3.24.4. Federal employees require a NAC.
   3.24.5. United States active duty, retired, or separated military members with an Honorable Dis-
   charge and no break in service greater than 24 months, may use a previously completed ENTNAC or
   NACLC.
   3.24.6. Contractor employees require a NAC. Contractors operating as visitor groups only (contract
   performance exceeding 90 consecutive days), have the following option. Commanders may grant
   individuals access to restricted areas subject to: (1) the contractor completing the SF 85P and it is sub-
   mitted to OPM for a NAC; (2) a check of the Defense Clearance and Investigations Index reveals no
   relevant, significant information which might preclude unescorted access; and (3) a check of appropri-
   ate local records.
   3.24.7. Commanders may waive on a case by case basis, the investigative requirements for
   unescorted entry to restricted areas containing PL2 and or 3 resources pending completion of a favor-
   able NAC, or NACIC after favorable review of the completed personnel security questionnaire for the
   investigation. Decisions to deny or withdraw must be fully supported by the documented facts. Indi-
   viduals must be informed of the adverse information about them (unless precluded by security consid-
   erations) and given the opportunity to appear before the commander. This allows the individual to
   refute or to mitigate the information. Forward appeals of denials or withdrawals to the MAJCOM
   commander or designee.
   3.24.7. (AETC) Forward a copy of appeals and denials to HQ AETC/A7SI.
   3.24.8. Interim access to restricted areas may be granted to military, civilians, and contractors. Use
   the same procedures for interim access as established for interim AIS (para 3.27.).
   3.24.9. For Foreign National military members and host military members assigned to USAF activi-
   ties, entry authorization is based on government-to-government agreements, treaties, and unified
   command directives. A SSBI is required for restricted areas containing PL1 or 2 resources, and a local
   agency check for restricted areas containing PL3 resources.

     3.24.10. Unit commanders through the installation commander, request NACs on contractor employ-
     ees requiring unescorted entry to restricted areas. The CAF adjudicates the completed NAC and enters
     the results in the appropriate database. Installation commanders approve all denials or withdrawals of
     unescorted entry for contractor employees.

3.25. Nonappropriated Fund Employees. Human Resources Office (HRO) managers (Attachment 4)
designate positions of trust. AFPD 34-3, Nonappropriated Funds Personnel Management and Adminis-
tration and AFI 34-301, Nonappropriated Fund Personnel Management and Administration establish
policies for the management of the AF Nonappropriated Fund Personnel Program. HRO managers make
suitability determinations according to the suitability criteria outlined in 5 CFR 731.201-202. The deter-
mination will be filed in the individual’s personnel file.

3.26. Special Agents and Investigative Support Personnel. See Attachment 3. Non-investigative per-
sonnel whose official duties require direct investigative support include administrative processing and or
handling of the investigative reports on a continuous basis. The CAF adjudicates the investigation and
enters the data in the DCII and AMS.

3.27. Personnel Occupying Information Systems Positions Designated Auto mated Information
Systems, AIS-I, AIS-II, and AIS-III (formerly ADP positions). Refer to DOD 5200.2-R, appendix K
for ADP definitions.
     3.27.1. See Attachment 3 for AIS I, II, and III investigation requirements. See paragraph 3.11. for
     interim security clearance requirements.
     3.27.2. The CAF provides the results of the investigations for AIS I, II, and III purposes to the autho-
     rized requester for the commander’s suitability determination according to the suitability criteria out-
     lined in 5 CFR 731.201-202. The CAF does not review the investigation for security clearance
     purposes.
     3.27.3. Commanders may recommend to the Designated Approving Authority (DAA) that interim
     AIS access be granted. Commanders may waive, on a case by case basis, the investigative require-
     ments for access to AIS pending completion of a favorable ENTNAC, NAC, NACIC, ANACI, or
     SSBI, after favorable review of the completed personnel security questionnaire for the investigation.
     Commanders confirm that the following actions have been accomplished prior to access:
        3.27.3.1. Mandatory information assurance training has been given and documentation by a
        supervisor accompanies the request.
        3.27.3.2. Systems Administrators have implemented measures to limit access to the information
        required to conduct assigned duties.
        3.27.3.3. Commanders and or supervisors have ensured increased monitoring of the individual

       See Attachment 3 for additional guidance.

5.2. Authorized Requesters.
   5.2.1. MAJCOM, field operating agency (FOA), or direct reporting unit (DRU) staffs designate
   authorized requesters to initiate PSIs for their organization. As a general rule, the number of autho-
   rized requesters will be kept to the minimum number required to meet mission requirements. See
   Attachment 2 for request procedures.
   5.2.1. (AETC) Each AETC installation and accession source to include ROTC detachments will
   establish a submitting office number (SON) with OPM. SONs can be obtained by submitting a com-
   pleted PIPS Form 12, Submitting Office Number (SON) Authorization and Amendment Form, to OPM
   Customer Service Branch at the Web site: https://jpas.dsis.dod.mil/docs/DISS_SAR.pdf.
   5.2.2. Authorized requesters provide the AFCAF with the name, telephone number, and office sym-
   bol of individual(s) who may obtain security clearance and or investigative data on individuals within
   their organization and provide copy to respective MAJCOM. See para 6.1. for AFCAF address.
   5.2.2. (AETC) Units will submit memorandums identifying authorized requestors to HQ AETC/
   A7SI. ANG units will submit memorandums to the NGB/A7SI. The memorandums are updated as
   changes occur.

   requester must coordinate the request through channels to AF/XOS-FI. Each authorized requester will
   maintain a fiscal year (FY) Excel spreadsheet listing for this purpose. The spreadsheet will include all
26                                                                AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007


     previously coordinated FY priority PSIs and all new requirements the authorized requester is coordi-
     nating under this authority. When coordinating new priority cases, forward the entire FY spreadsheet
     to afxofi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. AF/XOS-FI will return to the authorized requester for moni-
     toring the completion of the investigation.
     5.5.1. (AETC) The following AFSCs will be submitted as priority investigations: 2M0X1 - Missile
     and Space Systems Electrical Maintenance; 2M0X2 - Missile and Space Systems Maintenance;

     Authorized requesters will notify HQ AETC/A7SI via e-mail of all priority submissions. Notification
     will include individual’s SSN, AFSC, and date submitted.
     5.5.2. SCI. When the NACLC adjudication date is less than 12 months (DCID 6/4, Annex A, para 5),
     the servicing Authorized Requester will provide the servicing SSO a copy of the completed SF 86 for
     each SSBI request with an SCI access requirement. This will be done at the same time the request for
     SSBI/SCI is forwarded to OPM. Security Managers/SSOs/Authorized Requesters will expedite the
     processing of the SSBI off the installation to OPM and request priority level of service. On the OPM
     Agency Use Sheet annotate 30A in Block A. Also see AFMAN 14-304.

5.6. Personal Data Provided by the Subject of the Investigation.
     5.6.1. The Air Force goal for processing personnel security investigation requests at base level is 14
     duty days. However, commands that have extensive deployments and TDY requirements may estab-
     lish their own internal management controls and or timelines for the processing of investigation
     requests.
     5.6.2. The subject of the investigation will provide the required documentation to the security man-
     ager to verify birth and education information. See Attachment 2 for details.
     5.6.3. Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA): Upon accession, IMAs complete the PSI during
     the first three days of the individual duty training (IDT) period or not later than 90 days at the unit of
     assignment or attachment and turn-in to the servicing security manager and or gaining active duty
     security manager.
     5.6.4. See Chapter 8 for actions when individuals refuse to provide the required information for a
     personnel security investigation.
     5.6.5. DSS and OPM are the DOD repository of personnel security investigative files. To obtain a
     personal copy of an investigation, forward a notarized request that includes: name, SSAN, date of
     birth, and place of birth to: DSS, ATTN: Privacy Act Office, PO Box 46060, Baltimore, MD
     21240-6060 or OPM, ATTN: FOIA, PO Box 618, 1137 Branchton Rd, Boyers, PA 16018-0618. The
     request should refer to the Privacy Act and include a valid return address. All signatures must be nota-
     rized. Military personnel may use a commissioned officer in lieu of a notary public to attest to the sig-
     nature. Identify the SSN and rank of the officer. Also refer to AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act
     Program.
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                           27


5.7. Dual Citizenship. A security concern could exist when a military member, DoD civilian, contractor,
or consultant is submitted for a personnel security investigation and they are a dual citizen and/or possess/
use a foreign passport.
   5.7.1. Dual Citizenship. Dual citizenship in and of itself is not an automatic disqualifier for security
   clearance eligibility. However, possession of dual citizenship and particularly the exercise of dual cit-
   izenship is a condition that raises a security concern and may be a disqualifying factor in a security
   clearance eligibility determination. There are factors that could mitigate the maintenance of dual citi-
   zenship, as outlined in DoD 5200.2-R, App I, Foreign Preference. An individual’s expressed willing-
   ness to renounce dual citizenship is one of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.
   5.7.2. Possession or Use of a Foreign Passport. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport in prefer-
   ence to a US passport raises doubt as to whether the person’s allegiance to the US is paramount and
   could also facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the US. The security clearance will be denied or
   revoked, unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use
   from SAF/AA. Requests for approval are forwarded through respective Information Security Program
   Manager (ISPM) channels to HQ USAF/XOS-FI for processing to SAF/AA. Justification must
   include what benefit the AF will gain from a person holding a foreign passport. AFCAF will annotate
   approvals in the remarks field of the JPAS.
   5.7.3. Surrendering the Passport. Individuals who indicate they possess a foreign passport in item 15
   of the Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire or item 17d on the Standard Form 86, “Question-
   naire for National Security Positions,” will be required to surrender the passport via one of the fol-
   lowing methods:
       5.7.3.1. Return the passport to the appropriate country embassy or consulate via certified receipt
       mail. A copy of the transmittal memo forwarding the passport and the return receipt will be for-
       warded to the AFCAF. See para 6.1. for AFCAF address. If the name of adjudicator assigned to
       the case is known, include this in the ATTN line of the address.
       5.7.3.2. Destroy the passport as witnessed by an AF security manager. Cut up the passport and
       place in a burn bag. The witnessing security manager will document the destruction of the pass-
       port in an explanatory memorandum, which will be forwarded to the AFCAF and a copy provided
       to the subject.
   5.7.4. Security Clearance Eligibility. In order for individuals who hold foreign passport and dual cit-
   izenship to be considered for and/or be granted security clearance eligibility the following must be
   completed:
       5.7.4.1. Provide a written statement expressing their willingness to renounce foreign citizenship
       claims in favor of a sole United States citizenship status. Actual renouncement is not required.
       5.7.4.2. Return and or destroy the passport.
   5.7.5. The renouncement statement and documentation of destruction of the passport must be pro-
   vided to the AFCAF. The AFCAF reviews each case on its own merits to determine security clearance
   eligibility.
   5.7.6. This same guidance will apply if the passport is identified after a security clearance determina-
   tion is made.

                                            ADJUDICATION

6.1. Central Adjudication Authority. The Air Force Central Adjudication Facility (AFCAF) is the
Central Adjudication Authority. Address is: AFCAF/PSA, 229 Brookely Ave, Bolling AFB 20032.
     6.1.1. The policy and criteria set forth in DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, paragraph 2-200, 6-102 and
     Appendix I will be applied in making personnel security determinations for a security clearance or
     assignment to sensitive duties.
     6.1.2. Unfavorable adjudication results in the denial/revocation of clearance eligibility (see Chapter
     8).
     6.1.3. The AFCAF will review all investigative products and make an eligibility determination.
     6.1.4. AFCAF Customer Service will not release adverse information to inquiring customers on
     pending investigations, as it invokes privacy act concerns. Derogatory issues are often resolved
     through completion of the investigation and or adjudication of the case. Premature dissemination of
     unresolved and or un-adjudicated issues could result in discriminatory practices with respect to such
     areas as employments or assignments.
     6.1.4. (AETC) AETC units will safeguard investigation and suitability reports as outlined in DoD
     5200.2-R, Chapter 10, Safeguarding Personnel Security Investigative Records.

6.2. Adjudicative Record. Personnel security determinations are reflected in the JPAS. JPAS replaced
Sentinel Key (SK) as used throughout AFI 31-501.
6.3. (Added-AETC) Suitability Determinations. If derogatory, unfavorable, or potentially disqualify-
ing information is identified on local files check (LFC), the Defense Clearance and Investigations Index
(DCII), Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) check, or other suitability investigations, the OPR will
perform a suitability determination. The OPR:
     6.3.1. (Added-AETC) When a suitability determination is required, coordinates with the individual’s
     supervisor, commander, and security forces (SF) to determine if the individual is deemed suitable for
     employment.
     6.3.2. (Added-AETC) Elevates unresolved disputes arising from suitability determinations to the
     appropriate level within the installation chain of command for resolution. SF may dispute a suitability
     determination when identified information generates concerns pertaining to force protection and other
     installation and personnel protection issues.
     6.3.3. (Added-AETC) Documents all suitability determination results in a formal memorandum. The
     OPR maintains the original copy of suitability determinations on file, normally in the employee’s offi-
     cial personnel folder (OPF) or other employee folder, and provides a copy to the employee’s unit com-
     mander or equivalent with position designation authority.
6.4. (Added-AETC) Contractor and/or Consultant Suitability Determinations. T h e s u i t a b i l i t y
determination requirements and procedures outlined in paragraphs 6.3. (Added) through 6.3.3. (Added)
above apply equally to contractor and consultant personnel.
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                          29

                       ISSUING CLEARANCE AND GRANTING ACCESS

7.1. General
   7.1.1. The AFCAF is the designated authority to grant, suspend, deny, or revoke personnel security
   clearances and SCI accesses (see Chapter 11).
   7.1.2. Position Designations (7-100c). Commanders:
      7.1.2.1. Determine the level of access necessary for each military and civilian position based on
      mission needs. Each position is coded with the appropriate security access requirement (SAR) and
      identified in the unit manning document (UMD), the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System
      (DCPDS), and SK. See Attachment 3, for SAR code definitions. If the SAR code requires a
      change, the unit commander submits an authorization change request to the servicing security
      activity.
      7.1.2.2. Conduct a review annually to determine the accuracy of position coding, eliminate
      unnecessary access codings, and adjust SAR code appropriately.
      7.1.2.3. Record findings in the UMD and SK.
      7.1.2.4. Ensure only necessary investigations are requested to meet mission essential needs.

7.2. Investigative Requirements for Coding Positions. Commanders will:
   7.2.1. Determine the type of investigation required for mission purposes for each military and civilian
   position in the organization. Investigations are required for multiple purposes: to determine suitability
   and/or trustworthiness of individual for employment/assignment to positions of trust/access to certain
   programs; and for security clearance. Each position is coded with the appropriate position code
   reflecting the required investigation level in the unit manning document (UMD) and the Defense
   Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS). These will also be reflected in the Headquarters Air Force
   Manpower Data System (HAF-MDS).
      7.2.1.1. Assign one of the five investigation types to each position:
          7.2.1.1.1. Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).
          7.2.1.1.2. National Agency Check, Local Agency Checks and Credit (NACLC).
          7.2.1.1.3. Access National Agency Check and Inquiries (ANACI).
          7.2.1.1.4. National Agency Check Plus Inquiries (NACI)
          7.2.1.1.5. National Agency Check (NAC).
      7.2.1.2. The definitions and corresponding codes are located in Attachment 22, Table A22.1.
      7.2.1.3. Conduct annual review to determine the accuracy of position coding. The last AF-wide
      directed review was conducted in May 04. Reviews will be conducted each May. Retain results for
      review during self inspections, etc.
      7.2.1.4. Ensure only necessary investigations are requested to meet mission essential needs.
      7.2.1.5. See Attachment 22 for additional guidance.

     7.2.2. Mandatory Secret or Top Secret requirement may be required when every position in a spe-
     cialty is not coded as requiring access to classified information if the functional community can vali-
     date security access requirements for the AFSC and provide justification that demonstrates mandatory
     qualification required for mission accomplishment, such as access to classified information or equip-
     ment.

7.3. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs). H Q U S A F / X O S - F I
approves requests for adding security clearances or investigations as AFSC prerequisites. Requests are
staffed through ISPM channels. AFMAN 36-2105, Officer Classification and AFMAN 36-2108, Enlisted
Classification will reflect an SSBI requirement for entry, award, and retention for the respective manda-
tory AFSCs. See Attachment 22; Table A22.2., A22.3.
     7.3.1. Security clearance data can be verified by the CAVS, Permanent Change of Station Orders, or
     Temporary Duty Orders.

7.4. Investigative Requirements for Sensitive Programs. There are several sensitive programs that
have been designated as a mandatory SSBI requirement, i.e., Presidential Support, Personnel Reliability
Program, etc. See Attachment 22, Table A22.4.
     7.4.1. AMS is the application used by the CAF and is restricted to CAF personnel only.
        7.4.1.1. It is a centralized database enabling CAF personnel to post adjudication results; security
        clearance determinations; access eligibility; pending actions; status of due process actions, i.e.
        security information files; statistical reporting requirements; and other personnel security manage-
        ment functions.
        7.4.1.2. Selected data fields from AMS will be available through CAVS to Air Force customers/
        users almost immediately after input by CAF personnel and within 24 hours of data input by other
        customers/users.
     7.4.2. CAVS is the application used by MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs, ISPMs, SSOs, unit level security
     managers, and other individuals with personnel/physical security responsibilities. MAJCOM/FOA/
     DRUs will determine those organizations and individuals within their organizations who will be given
     CAVS access. Clearance data elements in the CAVS include the full date and type of investigation and
     the full date and status of security clearance. The information is invalid when any of these four data
     elements are incomplete.
        7.4.2.1. Use the most current highest level eligibility recorded in the CAVS when more than one
        entry appears for an individual.
        7.4.2.2. An individual may have multiple SAR codes recorded in the CAVS if the individual is in
        multiple positions (i.e. civilian, reserve, or air national guard). The level of access given to the
        individual should be based on the access necessary for the position. Commanders make the deci-
        sion on the level of access required.
        7.4.2.3. The term “DCID 6/4 (formerly DCID 1/14)” means the person has been the subject of a
        SSBI, has been granted a Top Secret security clearance, is eligible for SCI access if required for
        mission essential purposes (depending on the currency of the investigation) and or may already
        have SCI access. See AFMAN 14-304.
        7.4.2.4. The CAVS will provide the following information:
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                         31


        7.4.2.4.1. An individual’s security clearance level and access.
        7.4.2.4.2. Visit and suspension notifications.
        7.4.2.4.3. SCI indoctrination, nondisclosure statement, and debriefing dates.
        7.4.2.4.4. Establishment of a SIF.
     7.4.2.5. Access to the CAVS is restricted to Air Force employees only. Contractors and others
     who are assigned to an ISPM or SSO office must have prior approval by the SK Program Manage-
     ment Office (497 IG/INSP (PMO)) for access.
     7.4.2.6. There are 7 User Levels in the CAVS. These levels are defined as follows:
        7.4.2.6.1. Level 1: CAF personnel and Systems Administrators.
        7.4.2.6.2. Level 2: MAJCOM/FOA/DRU SCI security personnel.
        7.4.2.6.3. Level 3: Base SCI security personnel.
        7.4.2.6.4. Level 4: MAJCOM/FOA/DRU non-SCI security personnel.
        7.4.2.6.5. Level 5: Base ISPM security personnel.
        7.4.2.6.6. Level 6: Entry Controller.
        7.4.2.6.7. Level 7: Unit Level Security Manager.
     7.4.2.7. User Levels have the following CAVS read and write access:
        7.4.2.7.1. User levels 2-7 have read access to all Air Force personnel.
        7.4.2.7.2. User levels 2 and 4 may write to records within their MAJCOM/FOA/DRU PAS-
        CODE.
        7.4.2.7.3. User levels 3 and 5 may write to records within their local PASCODE and to
        records of individuals assigned to another MAJCOM/FOA/DRU supported by levels 3 and 5.
        7.4.2.7.4. User level 6, entry controller, has the ability to verify an individual’s clearance eli-
        gibility and access in the CAVS. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU may have reports printed for entry
        controllers by base ISPM security personnel (user level 5) listing the clearance eligibility and
        access of expected visitors. Reports will only be valid for the date and time printed.
        7.4.2.7.5. User level 7 has the ability to write non-SCI access (interim, secret, and top secret);
        nondisclosure dates; NATO access; and the indoctrination/debriefing dates. Level 7 is also
        authorized to view non-SCI access history and print reports associated with their write capa-
        bilities.
     7.4.2.8. ISPMs determine the number of users and the access level for each user within their com-
     mand. The system administrator will establish user accounts. SK allows unlimited users on one
     computer, but each user must have an individual account. A user account must be restricted to the
     registered user only.
     7.4.2.9. User Levels 1-3 must have a Top Secret clearance based on an SSBI or PR. User Levels
     4-7 require a Secret clearance based on an ENTNAC, NAC, NACLC, NACI, NACIC, or ANACI.
32                                                            AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007


     7.4.3. The CAF will publish and keep current a SK training guide with instructions on the use of
     AMS and CAVS. The CAF will review/update the SK web page at least monthly, to provide additional
     guidance and references as needed.
     7.4.4. Requests for changes to SK must be forwarded by the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Security Forces
     or Special Security Office (SSO) to the SK Requirements Group through the 497 IG/INSP, 229
     Brookley Ave, Bolling AFB DC, 20332-7040.
     7.4.5. SK will be replaced with the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) which will be the
     DOD personnel security automated system that contains investigative and security clearance data.

7.5. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Deployments, Operational or Contractual Exigen-
cies. This policy does not apply to SCI. Positions identified for deployments will, as a minimum, be
assigned a NACLC, requiring access to Secret information for the in-country threat briefing. SSBIs are
not authorized for purposes of Top Secret eligibility “just in case of” deployment. In these situations,
commanders grant interim Top Secret access for a period of up to 180 days. This can be renewed for
extended deployment purposes and for redeployment. Interim Top Secret access is granted for the purpose
of deployment based on the existing NACLC, and discontinued upon return to home station. SSBIs will
not be required for this purpose. Persons must be US citizens and have not had a break in service for more
than 24 months. Record of the interim TS is annotated in JPAS or in cases where it is not available, docu-
mented and maintained with security related documents. However, SSBI is authorized if a joint or theater
deployment requires a final Top Secret security clearance and will not accept interims, i.e., JCS contin-
gencies. These requirements need to be identified and positions coded IAW para 7.2. of this instruction.

7.6. Approval Authorities for Additional/New/Upgrade of SSBIs. 3-Star/Civilian Equivalent author-
ity is required to approve any additional/new/upgrade SSBIs before the servicing Manpower Office codes
the positions on the UMD. Approval authorized can not be delegated. Approval authorities are as follows:
     7.6.1. MAJCOMs: CV or NAF/CC
        7.6.1.1. The authorized requester forwards a copy of the MFR to the individual's security man-
        ager.
        7.6.1.2. The authorized requester and the unit keep the MFR until the CAVS shows a final secu-
        rity clearance.
     7.6.2. FOAs: parent 2-Ltr or SAF/AA or AF/CVA if the parent 2-Ltr is not at the appropriate grade
     level
     7.6.3. DRUs: AF/CVA.
     7.6.4. HQ USAF:
        7.6.4.1. Air Staff: AF/CVA
        7.6.4.2. Secretariate: SAF/AA.
     7.6.5. Commands will establish internal certifying procedures. The approval documentation will be
     retained by the Manpower Office for three years and is subject to compliance review by HQ AFIA or
     their designee. Approval will increase MAJCOM funds withhold for personnel security investigations
     through the FYDP.
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                           33


       7.6.5.1. (Added-AETC) Unit commanders submit requests through the base information security
       program manager (ISPM) to the base manpower office. Individual bases may require additional
       coordination steps. The base manpower office prepares a simulated change notice which is for-
       warded to the HQ AETC/A1M. HQ AETC/A1M will coordinate the change request notice with
       HQ AETC/A7SI and the AETC functional area manager.
       7.6.5.2. (Added-AETC) Once all initial coordination steps are completed, return the package to
       the requester who will prepare and send a formal staff package (Attachment 28 (Added)) to the
       HQ AETC/CV or the Air University Commander (AU/CC) as appropriate. The staff package will
       contain recommendations received as a result of the above coordination process.

7.7. Periodic Reinvestigations. Periodic Reinvestigations will be kept current for incumbents assigned
against positions coded as requiring SSBI and NACLC/ANACI. Also see para A2.7.

7.8. Issuing Security Clearance Eligibility. AFCAF issues security clearance eligibility and enters the
determination into JPAS.

7.9. The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). JPAS is the Department of Defense (DoD) per-
sonnel security clearance and access database. It facilitates personnel security management for the DoD
Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF), security managers, and offers both non-SCI and SCI functions. It
interfaces with the investigative providers, the personnel systems within the Department thus eliminating
manual transactions and expediting the flow of personnel security information to warfighters.
   7.9.1. JPAS is the primary source for determining investigative data/status of investigations on indi-
   viduals in the DoD. JPAS allows communication between the CAFs and its customers. All informa-
   tion in JPAS is unclassified, but must be protected according to the requirements for privacy/sensitive
   information and For Official Use Only (FOUO) in accordance with AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy
   Act Program and DoDR 5400.7/AF Supplement, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program.
   7.9.2. JPAS has two applications: The Joint Adjudication Management System (JAMS) and Joint
   Clearance and Access Verification System (JCAVS)
       7.9.2.1. JAMS is for adjudicative personnel only and provides capabilities such as case manage-
       ment/distribution, adjudication decisions, adjudicative history and summary, due process, and
       future ability for each CAF to electronically access investigative reports from the investigative
       providers.
           7.9.2.1.1. JAMS replaced the Adjudicative Management System (AMS), as used throughout
           this instruction.
       7.9.2.2. JCAVS is for non-SCI and SCI security managers/officers and authorized requesters and
       provides capabilities such as access indoctrination/debriefing history, incident/issue file reporting,
       history and management of unit personnel security functions.
           7.9.2.2.1. JCAVS replaced Clearance and Access Verification System (CAVS), as used
           throughout this instruction.
   7.9.3. ISPMs determine the number of users and the access levels for each user. Clearance data ele-
   ments in the JCAVS include the full date and type of investigation and the full date and status of secu-
   rity clearance. The information is invalid when any of these four data elements are incomplete.
34                                                              AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007


     7.9.3. (AETC) Establish a single user account for each individual requiring access to JPAS. Only
     establish accounts after verifying the individual requires access to JPAS in the performance of their
     duties, meets the minimum investigative requirements for the type of account required, has completed
     JPAS training, and completed a JPAS Account Request Form Account managers may provide local-
     ized JPAS training when online training via the JPAS Web site is unavailable. Provide a memorandum
     indicating that local training was conducted in lieu of online training.
        7.9.3.1. Use the most current highest level eligibility recorded in the JCAVS when more than one
        entry appears for an individual.
        7.9.3.2. The term “DCID 6/4 (formerly DCID 1/14)” means the person has been the subject of a
        SSBI, has been granted a Top Secret security clearance eligibility, is eligible for SCI access if
        required for mission essential purposes and may already have SCI access. See AFMAN 14-304.
     7.9.4. The JCAVS will provide the following information:
        7.9.4.1. An individual’s security clearance eligibility level and access level.
        7.9.4.2. Visit notification.
        7.9.4.3. Suspension notification.
        7.9.4.4. SCI indoctrination, nondisclosure statement, and debriefing dates
        7.9.4.5. Establishment of a SIF.
     7.9.5. JCAVS User Levels are as follows:
        7.9.5.1. Level 2 - SCI security personnel at unified command, DoD agency, military installation
        or major command/equivalent headquarters. Personnel Security Management (PSM) - Net is
        determined by the responsible SOIC or designee. (Read and Write Access - SSBI/DCID 6/4 with
        current SCI Access.)
        7.9.5.2. Level 3 - SCI security personnel at echelons subordinate to Level 2 at a particular geo-

        7.9.5.4. (AETC) The HQ AFROTC and AFROTC Regional Security program managers are
        authorized Level 5 user and account manager permissions.
        7.9.5.5. Level 6 - Unit Security Manager (additional duty) responsible for security functions as
        determined by responsible senior security official. (Read and Write Access - NACLC/ANACI/
        Secret Eligibility.)
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                           35


       7.9.5.5. (AETC) The primary USM and at least one alternate USM will have JPAS access for
       units that maintain classified information. For units that do not possess classified information, as a
       minimum, the primary security manager will have JPAS access. Unit-level, AFROTC detachment
       security managers, civilian personnel flight (CPF), and human resource office (HRO) security per-
       sonnel are authorized Level 6 access.
       7.9.5.6. Level 7 - Non-SCI Entry Control Personnel. Individuals who grant access to installa-
       tions, buildings, etc. Varies according to organizations. (Read Access - NACLC/ANACI/Secret

       Personnel Summary as a JCAVS Level 7 User. They will receive Visit Notification when their
       Security Management Office (SMO) is being notified of a visit. A Level 10 User may not be an
       account manager to create or delete an account at any level. NACLC/ANACI/Secret Eligibility.
   7.9.6. (Added-AETC) When CPF and HRO personnel do not have access to JPAS, the SF-authorized
   requester is responsible for JPAS data entry requirements generated by the CPF or HRO. SF-autho-
   rized requesters are responsible for establishing and managing JPAS accounts for CPF, HRO, and
   Army Air Force Exchange Service HRO.
   7.9.7. (Added-AETC) Account managers will ensure each unit under their span of responsibility has
   established a Security Management Office (SMO) code. Account managers will create new SMOs for
   those units that have not previously been established.
   7.9.8. (Added-AETC) HQ AETC/A7SI activates and deactivates Level 5 account managers and
   users. Requesters will notify HQ AETC/A7SI by e-mail that the individual completed JPAS training
   and the unit has a signed security access requirement (SAR) on file. Units will maintain JPAS docu-
   mentation until the individual’s account is deactivated. Once access is no longer needed, notify HQ
   AETC/A7SI by e-mail to deactivate the account. Installation account managers are responsible for
   activating and deactivating accounts for installation users. Prior to activating new users, the installa-
   tion account manager must ensure the individual has an official need for access, received JPAS train-
   ing, and provided the account manager with a completed system access request form. Account
   managers will maintain certification of training and a copy of the SAR on file until the individual no
   longer requires access.
   7.9.9. (Added-AETC) Personnel no longer requiring access are deactivated as soon as possible.
   Notify the servicing account manager by SAR or e-mail to deactivate the account.

7.10. AF JPAS Users Guide. Contains detailed instructions on operating JPAS and becoming a new
user. See the follow URL: https://wwwmil.lackland.af.mil/afsf/Organization/AFXOF/
XOF%20memo%2012%20Jul%2004%20AF%20JPAS%20Guide1.pdf
JPAS web site is: https://jpas.osd.mil Requests for changes to JPAS may be made on-line at https://
jpas.osd.mil.
36                                                              AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007


7.10. (AETC) AF JPAS Users Guide. Submit requests for changes to JPAS as a test problem report
(TPR). Send an information copy of the TPR to HQ AETC/A7SI.

7.11. Granting Access. Commanders grant access to classified information when a mission essential
need exists and only when all of the following prerequisites are met: (1) individual has the appropriate
security clearance eligibility; (2) individual has signed an SF 312 (see AFI 31-401); and (3) individual has
a need-to-know. Authorized base level users will record access in the JCAVS. See Chapter 3 for other sit-
uations when access to classified information may be granted.

7.12. Obtaining Information from the AFCAF.
     7.12.1. Authorized requesters may contact the AFCAF Customer Support Section through JPAS. In
     situations where no security clearance data is available at the unit, no information is available in the
     JCAVS, and the AFCAF has valid security clearance information on file, a record of the call will be
     used as evidence of valid clearance data pending update of the JCAVS. The authorized requester pre-
     pares a memorandum for record (MFR) showing: (1) name, grade, and organization of the individual
     calling the AFCAF; (2) name, grade, organization, and SSN of the subject; (3) name of person at the
     AFCAF providing clearance eligibility data, and (4) type and date of investigation and, if granted,
     level and date of security clearance eligibility. Also see para 6.1.
     7.12.1. (AETC) Authorized requesters should only call the AFCAF after first verifying the issue
     could not be resolved by the security manager through JPAS. E-mail notification is sufficient instead
     of a memorandum for record (MFR). Retain copies of all e-mail correspondence until the case is
     closed.
        7.12.1.1. The authorized requester forwards a copy of the MFR to the individual's security man-
        ager.
        7.12.1.2. The authorized requester and the security manager keep the MFR until JCAVS is
        updated to show the data addressed in the MFR.
7.13. (Added-AETC) JPAS Research Request or Upgrade Eligibility Requests. USMs will:
     7.13.1. (Added-AETC) Submit a request to research or upgrade eligibility in JPAS to the AFCAF
     before seeking assistance from the authorized requester. In most cases, the AFCAF response to the
     request to research or upgrade eligibility in JPAS provides the required information; however, if fur-
     ther information or clarification is needed; the USM contacts the authorized requester for assistance.
     7.13.2. (Added-AETC) Not submit requests to research or upgrade eligibility in JPAS to the AFCAF
     until the case is closed at the investigative agency for at least 60 days.
     7.13.3. (Added-AETC) Not submit requests to research or upgrade eligibility to the AFCAF to
     inquire on the status of an investigation at an investigative agency. The AFCAF is strictly an adjudica-
     tion facility and does not control the investigative process. Additionally, do not submit requests to
     research or upgrade eligibility to the AFCAF to request personnel data changes in JPAS. Personal
     information in JPAS is updated through the personnel systems database. Personnel will request these
     changes through the civilian or military personnel flight (MPF).
7.14. (Added-AETC) Supporting Student Clearances:
     7.14.1. (Added-AETC) If a final or interim security clearance is required to start training, authorized
     requesters will coordinate with the training school registrar to obtain a class roster at least 2 weeks
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                    37


  before the class starting date. This allows time to work issues and possibly avoid situations when a
  clearance may not be granted in time to start training.
  7.14.2. (Added-AETC) If security forces or authorized requesters cannot clear the students through
  normal procedures, such as confirming a receipt, granting an interim security clearance when appro-
  priate, or validating the investigation status through Joint Clearance and Verification System
  (JCAVS), prepare a memorandum for the AFCAF. Fax or electronically transmit the memorandum to
  the AFCAF and courtesy copy HQ AETC/A7SI with the student's full name, SSN, any break in ser-
  vice, type of clearance required, and class-start date. The owning SSO submits requests and queries
  the AFCAF on issues dealing with access to SCI and special access programs.

                                                 Chapter 8

                           UNFAVORABLE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS

8.1. Referral for Action.
     8.1.1. Security Information File (SIF). A SIF is a collection of documents generated as a result of the
     discovery or development of unfavorable information which brings into question a person’s continu-
     ing eligibility for a security clearance or access to SCI. It may be established by a commander, civilian
     equivalent, or by the CAF. The SIF serves as a repository for unfavorable or derogatory information
     that requires further review, evaluation, or investigation to resolve outstanding administrative or adju-
     dicative concerns. Report administrative change of status information for individuals with SCI access
     according to AFMAN 14-304.
     8.1.2. Reporting Government Charge Card Abuses and Misuse. Security Officials, AFOSI, or AF
     Government Charge Card program coordinators are required to immediately report Government
     Charge Card abuses and misuses to the appropriate commander. This information constitutes serious
     questions as to the individual’s ability or intent to protect classified information or execute sensitive
     duties. The commander will make an immediate determination to either leave the individual’s security
     status unchanged or suspend their access to classified information or assignment to sensitive duties
     until the appropriate authority makes a final determination regarding the individual’s eligibility to
     retain a security clearance. In addition, commanders may take action in accordance with Chapter 8,
     to determine if a SIF should be established and/or the person’s access to classified information should
     be suspended.
     8.1.3. Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances as Man-
     dated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 – Smith
     Amendment. Attachment 24 outlines the instructions.

8.2. Suspension.
     8.2.1. Commander:
        8.2.1.1. Reviews unfavorable information on individuals under the commander’s jurisdiction
        when reported or developed which would directly impact an individual’s security clearance or SCI
        access, to include the following (see Attachment 11 for sample memorandum):
            8.2.1.1.1. Activities’ tenant or geographically separated units.
            8.2.1.1.2. TDY personnel.
        8.2.1.2. Establishes a SIF when an individual’s activity, conduct or behavior is inconsistent with
        the security criteria specified in DOD 5200.2-R, para 2-200 and Appendix I. See Attachment 12
        for sample request for SIF establishment to the servicing security activity.
        8.2.1.2. (AETC) Do not establish security information files (SIF) on basic military trainees at
        Lackland Air Force Base. The 319 TRS sends a copy of the discharge orders to the AFCAF when
        a basic trainee is separated for criteria that would otherwise result in establishing a SIF. The orders
        must show the reason for discharge.
        8.2.1.3. Determines whether or not to establish a SIF on a case by case basis, normally within 20
        days of receipt of unfavorable information (as soon as possible if SCI access is involved). This
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                        39


     decision is made by considering the seriousness of the incident; the individual’s motivation;
     whether it was out of character for the individual; or whether the undesirable conduct or behavior
     is likely to continue. Coordination and consultation with the chief of the servicing security activ-
     ity, SSO (for SCI access) or program security officer (for SAP access) and legal representatives is
     recommended. However, if the commander has sufficient reason to doubt the validity of unfavor-
     able information the decision to establish a SIF and notification to the CAF may be extended up to
     45 days. If the servicing security activity and the commander disagree on establishment of a SIF,
     elevate the issue to the installation commander for resolution. Once a SIF is formally established
     it must be processed accordingly and only the CAF has closure authority.
        8.2.1.3.1. Examples of reasons to establish a SIF are outlined in para 2-200, DOD 5200.2-R
        and include the following:
            8.2.1.3.1.1. Refusal to sign a required SF 312 or other nondisclosure agreement.
            8.2.1.3.1.2. Refusal or intentional failure of an individual requiring an investigation or
            periodic reinvestigation to provide the personnel security questionnaire information or
            release statements for review of medical, financial, or employment records.
            8.2.1.3.1.3. Refusal by an individual to be interviewed in connection with a personnel
            security investigation, regardless of whether the information is requested by the investiga-
            tive agency or the CAF.
            8.2.1.3.1.4. Incidents of theft, embezzlement, child or spouse abuse, unauthorized sale or
            use of firearms, explosives, or dangerous weapons, or misuse or improper disposition of
            government property or other unlawful activities.
            8.2.1.3.1.5. Information leading to permanent decertification from PRP for other than
            physical reasons.
        8.2.1.3.2. The following are some examples of reasons that may not warrant establishment of
        a SIF:
            8.2.1.3.2.1. Minor traffic violations.
            8.2.1.3.2.2. Minor one-time alcohol related incident.
            8.2.1.3.2.3. Permanent decertification from PRP related to medical reasons of a physical
            nature.
            8.2.1.3.2.4. Disciplinary issues; such as failure to repair; poor duty performance; failure to
            maintain weight standards; and any single isolated incident of poor judgment based on
            immaturity or extenuating circumstances which does not impact on the individual’s ability
            to safeguard classified information.
            8.2.1.3.2.5. Federal civilian employees occupying nonsensitive positions.
            8.2.1.3.2.6. Incidents where a SIF has already been established by the CAF based on the
            same unfavorable information.
     8.2.1.4. Determines whether or not to initiate suspension action for the individual’s access to clas-
     sified information upon establishment of a SIF. If the decision is to suspend the person’s access to
     classified information the same decision automatically applies to the SCI and SAP access. The
     access to classified information and SCI is considered one under the new DOD personnel security
40                                                             AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007


        common adjudicative guidelines. Additionally, the commander determines suspension of
        unescorted entry to restricted areas if applicable. The determination to suspend should be based on
        a thorough review of the facts and an assessment of the risk to national security. For SCI access
        see AFMAN 14-304 and DOD S-5105.21-M-1, Sensitive Compartmented Information Adminis-
        trative Manual.
        8.2.1.4. (AETC) Access to classified information is suspended when the AFCAF adjudicates an
        investigation as “action pending.”
        8.2.1.5. Notifies the individual accordingly with information copy to the servicing security activ-
        ity. See Attachment 13 and Attachment 14 for sample memorandums.
        8.2.1.6. Requests AFOSI investigation, if criminal activity is involved.
        8.2.1.7. Includes a recommendation whether to grant, reinstate, deny, or revoke the individual’s
        security clearance and or SCI/SAP access and the rationale for the decision in the completed SIF.
        The documented facts must fully support the recommendation. Refer to DOD 5200.2-R, Appendix
        I, Adjudicative Guidelines.
        8.2.1.8. Requests the CAF to immediately close a SIF favorably via priority message (through the
        MAJCOM or activity SSO for SCI) when special circumstances exist (i.e., individual was falsely
        accused or holds a special expertise that is essential for mission accomplishment). The com-
        mander provides the CAF with the SIF (if not already at the CAF) and full justification for favor-
        able closure. The CAF will then make the security clearance determination or request additional
        information, if necessary.
        8.2.1.9. Endorses requests by Chief of Servicing Security Activity (SF), SSO, and Program Secu-
        rity Officer (PSO) for evaluations and relevant documentation from on base activities when issues
        warrant such coordination.
        8.2.1.10. (Added-AETC) When establishing a SIF on civilian employees, informs the CPF, labor
        and employee management relations section.
     8.2.2. Chief of Servicing Security Activity, SSO, and PSO:
        8.2.2.1. Provides guidance to commanders on SIF establishment. SF is OPR for Top Secret and
        Secret security clearance SIFs; SSO is OPR for SCI access SIFs.
        8.2.2.2. Establishes, processes, maintains, monitors SIFs for commanders. See Attachment 15
        for sample memorandum for notification to the commander of SIF establishment. See Attach-
        ment 16 for sample SIF custodian checklist.
        8.2.2.2. (AETC) Use AETC Form 491, Security Information File (SIF) Checklist, along with the
        checklist items listed in AFI 31-501, Attachment 16, Sample SIF Custodian Checklist Items. File
        SIFs in a six-part folder and label:
            8.2.2.2.1. (Added-AETC) Part 1: AETC Form 491. Document unit and custodian actions
            related to the SIF.
            8.2.2.2.2. (Added-AETC) Part 2: AF IMT 2587. Use the AF IMT 2587, Security Termina-
            tion Statement, to document the security termination statement.
            8.2.2.2.3. (Added-AETC) Part 3: Establishment Notification. Use ISPM and commander
            correspondence relating to the establishment of the SIF.
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                       41


        8.2.2.2.4. (Added-AETC) Part 4: JCAVS/AFCAF. Use AFCAF and JCAVS notifications
        and related correspondence.
        8.2.2.2.5. (Added-AETC) Part 5: Information Reports. Use this part to store police, office
        of special investigations (OSI), investigative, and other adverse reports or information.
        8.2.2.2.6. (Added-AETC) Part 6: Staff Agency Recommendations. Use this part to store
        eligibility recommendations from outside agencies.
     8.2.2.3. Provides initial notification to the CAF upon SIF establishment via message or CAVS
     within 10 days. Provide full name, SSAN, security clearance data, date SIF established, reason,
     and if access to classified information and SCI has been suspended or withdrawn. If the individual
     has or is being processed for SCI access, forward the notification to the CAF through the MAJ-
     COM or activity SSO. Notify the CAF via memorandum when the individual will be permitted to
     continue access to classified information and SCI access. See Attachment 17 for sample memo-
     randum. Notify the CAF via memorandum when the individual’s access is withdrawn. Process
     SIFs concerning SCI access according to AFMAN 14-304. If SCI access is involved, the SSO is
     responsible for managing the SIF in its entirety to include actions required for the security clear-
     ance. SF, SSO, and PSO exchange notification information and coordinate actions with each other.
     Additionally, notify the CAF when:
        8.2.2.3.1. Unfavorable information results in a discharge, retirement, or separation. Forward a
        copy of the discharge or separation orders or a copy of the SF 50B3PT, Notification of Person-
        nel Action, plus any additional unfavorable information used in these actions. If discharge is
        involved and the individual is or has been indoctrinated for SCI in the past three years, see
        AFMAN 14-304 for discharge for cause procedures.
        8.2.2.3.2. An adverse discharge is overturned and the individual returns to active duty.
     8.2.2.4. Notifies the Installation Commander when SIFs are established. See Attachment 18 for
     sample memorandum.
     8.2.2.5. Requests evaluations and relevant documentation from the following activities when the
     issue involved indicates coordination is appropriate (see Attachment 19):
        8.2.2.5.1. Director of Personnel. For any Unfavorable Information Files (UIF), performance
        report summaries, suitability determinations, and personnel actions.
        8.2.2.5.2. Security Forces. For any criminal activities or other pertinent data regarding the
        subject’s police record, involvement in previous compromises or security incidents.

     8.2.2.7. Forwards completed SIF, with required documentation, to the CAF for closure within 120
     days. See Attachment 21 for sample memorandum. If SCI access is involved forward the SIF
     through the MAJCOM or activity SSO to the CAF. See AFMAN 14-304 and DOD
     S-5105.21-M-1 for SCI guidance. Refer to DOD 5200.2-R, Chapter 8-102d regarding suspension
     cases over 180 days. Use first class mail in accordance with DODM 4525-8AFSUP1, Official
     Mail Manual.
     8.2.2.8. Contacts the CAF for an extension if SIF cannot be closed in 120 days.

AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                           43


       8.2.2.11. Maintains a suspense copy until the CAF has made the final determination, then
       destroys the SIF. If the individual had SCI access, destroy six months after accountability of the
       person ceases or when no longer needed, whichever is longer.
       8.2.2.12. (Added-AETC) Maintains a suitability package file on all AFCAF-generated “action
       pending” investigations until the AFCAF makes the final determination, and then destroys the file.
       The commander forwards the suitability package to the gaining servicing security activity or spe-
       cial security office (SSO) when an individual transfers to another assignment.
   8.2.3. Unit Security Manager:
       8.2.3.1. Implements the personnel security program within the organization and provides support
       to the servicing security activity or SSO.

       COM or activity SSO for SCI access) and updates the AMS and DCII with the eligibility determi-
       nation.
       8.2.4.4. Initiates and oversees due process procedures when security clearance eligibility and or
       access is denied, revoked, or suspended.
       8.2.4.5. Returns incomplete SIFs to commanders, through the servicing security activity, with a
       request for: (1) the required documentation; (2) the commander’s recommendation (3) an update
       on the individual’s current situation; and or (4) actions taken, expected, or pending.
       8.2.4.6. Establishes SIFs when unfavorable information is provided from other government agen-
       cies, court-martial orders, information summary reports from DSS, AFOSI reports of investiga-
       tion, and notification of special access denial from various access granting authorities. Notifies the
       commander for further action, when necessary.

8.3. Air Force Office of Special Investigations. AFOSI conducts personnel security investigation leads
in overseas areas for DSS. All Air Force commanders must report to AFOSI any alleged criminal activity

is available in AFI 71- 101, Volume I, Criminal Investigations.

8.4. Final Unfavorable Administrative Actions.
   8.4.1. The CAF is the designated authority to make personnel security determinations that can result
   in an unfavorable administrative action. Commanders take actions for removal due to unsuitability
   IAW 5 CFR 731.201-202, Suitability for Government Employment, at the same time as actions are
   being taken for denial or revocation of a person’s security clearance. The unfavorable administrative
   action on civilian personnel may not include any reference to security clearance issues until the results
   of the final security adjudication are available.
44                                                              AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007


8.5. Procedures.
     8.5.1. General. The CAF will make a final personnel security determination resulting in an unfavor-
     able clearance action on an Air Force member, civilian employee, contractor (for SCI), or any other
     Air Force affiliated person when the individual concerned has been afforded due process procedures
     according to this AFI and DOD 5200.2-R. These same due process procedures are also applicable for
     suspension, denial, or revocation of access to SCI. There is no distinction between a security clearance
     and SCI access in the adjudication process. If a clearance is revoked or denied, SCI access is also
     revoked or denied. The CAF will notify individuals concerning unfavorable administrative actions
     using the instructions in this AFI and DOD 5200.2-R. Although SAP access is also revoked or denied
     when a clearance is revoked or denied, administrative recourse (appeal) procedures are separate and
     distinct. See AFI 16-702, The Appeal Board (for Special Access Programs).
     8.5.2. The Air Force is not authorized to make any adverse security clearance determination on a
     civilian employee occupying a nonsensitive position. Since such positions do not involve sensitive
     duties or access to classified information, the provisions of the personnel security program regarding
     security clearance eligibility do not apply.
     8.5.3. Confinement. When it is determined that an applicant for a security clearance, or a person hold-
     ing a clearance, has been convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for more than one year,
     the clearance of such person shall be denied or revoked with the following actions taken by the CAF:
        8.5.3.1. Verification that the individual is presently imprisoned, serving a term of more than 12
        months.
        8.5.3.2. A Notice of Revocation or Denial of Security Clearance Eligibility forwarded through the
        Servicing Security Activity and SSO (for SCI) to the individual and the commander. The Notice is
        final and no rebuttal privileges or appeal rights are applicable.
        8.5.3.3. The revocation or denial action is entered in DCII and AMS.

8.6. Unfavorable Administrative Action Procedures.
     8.6.1. Denial Authority. The CAF provides individuals with written statements of reasons and other
     required documentation stating intent to deny or revoke their security clearances and SCI access using
     sample format in DOD 5200.2-R, App L and Atch 11.
     8.6.2. Instructions. Individuals may appeal unfavorable administrative actions according to the
     instructions in this AFI, DOD 5200.2-R, Chapter 8, and Appendix L and M. Individuals send commu-
     nications to the CAF and the local supporting Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) through their commanders.
     8.6.3. Designated Point of Contact (POC). Unit commanders will designate a POC to serve as a liai-
     son between the CAF and individuals under their jurisdiction when unfavorable administrative actions
     are being taken. POCs conduct the associated duties as outlined in DOD 5200.2-R, Appendix L-2. The
     CAF will send communications to the individual through the commander, SF, and SSO (for SCI). The
     supporting SJA will provide the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative
     Judge (AJ) appropriate legal support, upon request.
     8.6.4. Individual’s Response to the CAF. Individuals must advise the CAF in writing of their intent to
     respond to the statements of reasons. This must be done within ten days of receipt of the statement of
     reasons. Individuals state whether they intend to submit statements or documents to refute, correct, or
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                         45


  mitigate the intended actions. Within 60 days from the date of receipt of statements of reasons, indi-
  viduals must provide the CAF with their written rebuttals.
  8.6.5. Extensions. Extensions may only be granted by the CAF. A written request for an extension for
  up to 30 days can be submitted to the CAF through the POC and installation or unit commander.
  8.6.6. CAF Review of Individual’s Response to the Statement of Reasons. Upon receipt of the rebut-
  tal, the CAF will determine whether a security clearance should be reinstated, revoked, or denied and
  a final response will be provided to the individual. This must be done within 60 days from the date of
  receipt of the individual’s response. If a final response cannot be completed within 60 days, the indi-
  vidual must be notified in writing of this fact, the reasons, and the date a final response is expected.
  AMS will be updated to reflect the CAF decision.
  8.6.7. CAF Decision to Deny or Revoke. If the CAF decision is to deny or revoke a person’s security
  clearance the reasons for the final action will be included in a Letter of Denial/Revocation to the indi-
  vidual. Individuals will be afforded an opportunity to appeal to a letter of denial/revocation through
  the Personnel Security Appeal Board (PSAB) by one of two methods as outlined in this section and
  DOD 5200.2-R: (1) appeal without a personal appearance; or (2) appeal with a personal appearance
  before an Administrative Judge (AJ) from DOHA. Individuals must elect either (1) or (2); individuals
  may not do both. The CAF will process appeal cases as outlined in DOD 5200.2-R, Appendix L and
  Atch 11.
     8.6.7.1. Appeal Without a Personal Appearance. Individuals directly notify the PSAB of their
     intent to appeal without a personal appearance within 10 days of receipt of the letter of denial/
     revocation. Address requests to: President, Personnel Security Appeal Board, NAIC/IAN, 5113
     Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041-3230. Individuals send their appeals to the President of
     the PSAB within 40 days of receipt of the letter of denial/revocation.
     8.6.7.2. Appeal With a Personal Appearance. Individuals include the name and telephone number
     of the supporting SJA when requesting a personal appearance from DOHA (see Attachment 13).
     The POC will provide this information to the individual. DOHA initially contacts the SJA for sup-
     port with the appeal proceedings. Individuals advise DOHA in writing of their desire for a per-
     sonal appearance within 10 days of receipt of the letters of denial/revocation. Copies of these
     advisement’s are provided to the following: the POC, the supporting SJA, and the CAF. The SJA
     will coordinate with the DOHA AJ to assist in providing legal support, upon request and will
     advise on legal matters to the commander and the POC. The CAF will provide the individual’s
     case file to DOHA within 10 days upon DOHA’s request. A DOHA AJ will hear the individual’s
     case and forward the file, transcripts, any documentation obtained from the individual, and a rec-
     ommendation to sustain or overturn the letter of denial/revocation to the PSAB. The deadline for
     this is 30 days after the personal appearance. The AJ provides the CAF with a copy of the recom-
     mendation.
         8.6.7.2.1. Within CONUS personal appearances will be conducted at the individual’s duty sta-
         tion or at a nearby location for duty stations within the lower 48 states. For personnel assigned
         OCONUS, the appearances will be conducted at: (1) the individual’s duty station or a nearby
         suitable location; or (2) at DOHA facilities located in the metropolitan area of Washington,
         DC, or Los Angeles, California. The Director, DOHA or designee determines the appearance
         location. Travel and TDY costs for the individual will be the responsibility of the employing
         organization.

     8.6.8. Personnel Security Appeal Board (PSAB). The PSAB will review the individuals appeal pack-
     age, along with DOHA recommendation (if applicable) and notify the individual through the CAF of
     the board’s final decision. See Attachment 5 for additional guidance on the PSAB.

8.7. Security Clearance Reinstatement. An individual’s commander may request reinstatement of their
security clearance 12 months after the effective date of revocation or denial or decision of the PSAB,
whichever is later. Requests should be sent to the CAF with the commander’s recommendation for
approval. The commander includes an explanation on how the individual’s behavior has improved and the
appropriate documentation corresponding to the reason(s) for the denial or revocation. The documenta-
tion required depends on the reason(s) involved, such as, evaluation for mental health issues, evaluation
for drug or alcohol abuse; or current financial statement(s).
8.7. (AETC) Security Clearance Reinstatement. Commanders will forward all requests through the
installation servicing security activity.

8.8. Special Access Programs. Administrative due process for special access programs is handled sepa-
rately. See AFI 16-702, The Appeal Board (for Special Access Programs).

8.9. Obtaining Permission to Proceed in Courts-Martial, Administrative Discharges, and Civilian
Removal Actions.
     8.9.1. Unit commanders contemplating disciplinary or administrative action against military mem-
     bers or civilian employees that could lead to a discharge or removal must first obtain permission to
     proceed when personnel hold a special access. Do not take action on personnel who now hold or have
     held access within the periods specified below, to Single Integrated Operational Plan-Extremely Sen-
     sitive Information (SIOP-ESI), SCI, research and development (R&D) special access program,
     AFOSI special access program, or other special access program information until the appropriate spe-
     cial access program office approves. (Exceptions are for investigative and preliminary administrative
     procedures until the proposed action has been reviewed and approved by the functional activities hav-
     ing overall ownership for the affected information.) Commanders send a written request to the appro-
     priate special access program functional office for permission to proceed with further processing as
     outlined below. Apply security classification according to message contents. The request must
     include:
        8.9.1.1. The individual’s name, SSAN, age, marital status, duty assignment, unit assignment, date
        of separation and length of service of the member.
        8.9.1.2. The name of the official who authorized SCI or other special access. Include inclusive
        dates that the person was given access and the units involved.
        8.9.1.3. The specific reason for the proposed “for cause” action. Include the maximum sentence
        and type of separation, or discharge, or dismissal allowable.
        8.9.1.4. The type of separation, discharge, or dismissal contemplated in administrative cases, and
        the commander’s recommended type of discharge certificate to be issued.
        8.9.1.5. The type of court-martial, to include a description of offenses, with an outline of pro-
        posed charges and specifications; data as to any restraint; and any unusual circumstances which
        may affect the trial.
        8.9.1.6. Comparable data for civilian employees.
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                         47


     8.9.1.7. Any other information bearing on the proposed action.
  8.9.2. For SCI access contact the servicing MAJCOM or FOA Senior Intelligence Officer (SIO) for
  persons having current SCI access, and persons debriefed within the past three years, where damage
  assessment is considered minimal. Contact the servicing Special Security Office (SSO) to determine if
  the individual had SCI access. Commanders will continue to forward “Authority to Proceed” requests,
  where disclosure could result in serious damage, to SSO HQ USAF/INSD for AF Director of Intelli-
  gence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (HQ USAF/XOI) approval. Send the request as a Defense
  Special Security Communications System (DSSCS) message through the SSO to the MAJCOM or
  FOA SIO and to SSO HQ USAF/INSD. See AFMAN 14-304 for detailed instructions on how to pre-
  pare the DSSCS message.
  8.9.3. For SIOP-ESI access. Refer to AFI 10-1102, Safeguarding the Single Integrated Operational
  Plan (SIOP).
  8.9.4. For R&D access contact SAF/AQL for persons having current access to R&D special access
  programs and persons debriefed within the past year.
  8.9.5. For persons who have had a duty assignment with AFOSI and have held an AFOSI special
  access contact HQ AFOSI/IVO. The personnel records will reflect AFOSI employment or assign-
  ment. Commanders contact the local AFOSI detachment commander or HQ AFOSI/IVO to determine
  if the person held an AFOSI special access.
  8.9.6. For multiple accesses, commanders must obtain separate authorizations from each appropriate
  action agency listed above prior to proceeding.
  8.9.7. Processing goals at all command levels must comply with the speedy trial requirement and the
  potentially more restrictive time requirements in civilian removal actions. Normally, the processing
  time period should be concluded within 15 days; measured from the date of initiation request, to the
  date of approval; or denial by the OPR. Voluntary separations of airmen, officers, and civilian resigna-
  tions will not be handled under these procedures unless they are in lieu of adverse action. For volun-
  tary separations that are in lieu of adverse action, do not allow the separation authority to approve the
  separation until the appropriate action office grants authority to proceed.
  8.9.8. If a commander contemplates a general or special court-martial, processing of the case may
  proceed through preferral of charges and completion of the investigation required by Article 32,
  UCMJ together with collateral actions required under Article 32. Under no circumstances may the
  charges be referred to trial until the appropriate action office grants authority to proceed. Actions
  required by this paragraph do not apply to summary court-martials.
  8.9.9. If a commander contemplates discharging an enlisted member, processing of a "notification"
  case or a board hearing entitlement may proceed through giving the member notice of the proposed
  discharge, obtaining the member's response, scheduling necessary appointments, and conducting
  those appointments. Under no circumstances may the discharge be "approved" by the separation
  authority until the appropriate action office grants authority to proceed. For board hearing cases, the
  processing may proceed through initiation of the case, obtaining the member’s response, scheduling
  necessary appointments, and conducting those appointments. Under no circumstances may the con-
  vening authority order the board to be convened to hear the case until the appropriate action office
  grants authority to proceed.
48                                                               AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007


     8.9.10. If a commander or staff agency chief contemplates discharging an officer, the show cause
     authority may not initiate the discharge, issue the show cause memorandum, or otherwise require
     officers to show cause for retention until the appropriate action office grants authority to proceed.
     8.9.11. If a supervisor contemplates removal action against a civilian employee who holds special
     access, the supervisor must first coordinate with the servicing CPF. The commander of the unit to
     which the civilian is assigned will then forward a message to the appropriate Air Force OPR. Under
     no circumstances may a "notice of proposed removal" be issued until the Air Force OPR grants
     authority to proceed.
     8.9.12. Periodic reporting by the unit commanders should advise the parent MAJCOM and decision
     authority of any changes to the proposed action every 90 days until the action has been completed. If
     the nature of the case changes significantly (for example, from discharge to court martial or from vol-
     untary to involuntary discharge), the unit commander should notify the decision authority and seek
     further instruction. Unit commanders should transmit a final report when the adverse action has been
     completed. In the final report, include date and place of discharge. If a SIF has been established on the
     individual, the commander will notify the CAF of the discharge, and request closure of the SIF.
     8.9.13. Decision authorities submit an annual report of completed cases showing the number of cases
     considered, number of approvals and disapprovals, and number pending as of the end of the fiscal year
     to SAF/AAZ, 1720 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1720. For SCI: Quarterly Reporting
     Requirement (Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct): MAJCOM and FOA SIOs will submit quarterly reports to 497 IG/
     INSD (SSO), 229 Brookley Ave, Bolling AFB DC 20332-7040. For case management and control
     purposes include in the reports (1) name, grade, SSAN, organization; (2) reason for action (drug
     abuse, minor disciplinary infraction, etc); (3) proposed action (type discharge or court martial); (4)
     date authority to proceed given by SIO; and (5) current disposition (indicate whether case is open or
     closed). If closed, show type and date of discharge.

Terms
Authorized Requester—Organizations authorized to request Personnel Security Investigations (PSIs)
from DSS or OPM. The servicing security forces activity usually requests PSIs from DSS. The CPF
requests National Agency Check with Written Inquiries and Credit Check (NACICs) and Access National
Agency Check with Written Inquiries and Credit Check (ANACIs) from OPM.
Authorized Requester Code Listing—A listing of organizations specifically designated by MAJCOM,
FOA, or DRU to request PSIs.
Break In Service—Any break in active employment with a Federal agency or DOD contractor, including
suspension or termination of service or temporary retirement, whether or not seniority or pay is affected.
This does not include active duty military personnel attending civilian schools from which a service
commitment remains. A 24-month continuous break in service requires completion of a new PSI prior to
reissuance of a security clearance eligibility.

Note 4. State criminal history repository checks are conducted by OPM as part of a NAC for child care.
Enter Case Type Code “02” and Position Code “H” on the Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for
National Security Positions, or SF 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, and extra coverage
code of “8” on the SF 85, Questionnaire for Non-sensitive Positions. Enter “child care” in Block I
“Position Title” of the form.

NOTES:
1. A NACLC is a prerequisite for military members upon entry. DOD civilians receive a NACIC as a pre-
requisite for federal employment. These investigations exceed the required investigations and can be used
for unescorted entry.
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                           69


2. Air Reserve forces personnel with a current ENTNAC or NAC on file may have unescorted entry to
restricted areas while in civilian status, pending completion of the required NACIC.
3. Prior ENTNAC/NAC/NACI/NACIC investigations meet the requirements for prior military members
who have been separated. Commanders may waive on a case by case basis, the investigative requirements
for unescorted entry to restricted areas containing Protection Level (PL) 2 and or 3 resources pending
completion of a favorable NACLC, NAC, or NACIC after favorable review of the completed personnel
security questionnaire for the investigation.
4. Installation records checks on employees in child care services include a check of the state criminal his-
tory repository. The state criminal history repository checks are for suitability affecting the consolidated
civilian personnel office and morale, welfare, and recreation programs. The sponsoring activity sends out
and receives the state criminal history repository.
5. The NAC must consist of: (a) host-government law enforcement and security agency records check at
the city, state, province, and national level, (b) DCII check, and (c) FBI check where information exists
indicating residence by the foreign national in the United States for one year or more since the age 18.
   A3.2.1. (Added-AETC) Investigations for LAN Access. When submitting investigations for LAN
   access, the AFCAF returns the investigation to the authorized requester with a determination of favor-
   able or no determination made, since the individual does not require clearance eligibility. If favor-
   able, no further action is necessary. If returned as no determination made, then the unit commander
   with operational control over the subject of the investigation will complete a suitability determination
   via memorandum. Maintain the case file and memorandum until the individual no longer requires
   access to the LAN. Do not return the original case file or suitability determination to the AFCAF.

A3.3. Requesting NACLC/ANACI Investigations. Use the following table for guidance on NACLC
and ANACI investigations required for access to classified information.

ual will be subject to discharge. Under the exception, commissions in the reserve components other than
the National Guard may be offered to immigrant alien health professionals, chaplains, and attorneys.

ther college study are not authorized a new NACLC once they have been commissioned. Request recerti-
fication when the officer comes on active duty.

        I have reviewed the referred available unfavorable information concerning subject and do not
believe the suspension of access to classified information and or unescorted entry is warranted. My ratio-
nale for this decision is (explain) . Consequently, I’ve determined this case doesn’t meet the purview of
AFI 31-501 for SIF establishment. This individual’s continued access and or entry is in the best interest of
national security. Should additional unfavorable and or derogatory information become available, I will
reevaluate my decision. I have or have not coordinated this decision with the JA.
                                              OR
 I have reviewed the referred unfavorable information concerning the subject. I have determined the
derogatory and or unfavorable information concerning subject falls within the criteria of AFI 31-501,
Chapter 8. A SIF has been established, please set up a folder and maintain a SIF as outlined in AFI 31-
501, Chapter 8.
       I have or have not withdrawn (suspended) subject’s access to classified information and or
unescorted entry to restricted areas. Attached as applicable is the:
       a. AF Form 2583, Request for Personnel Security Action. (This form is used to document Spe-
cial Access, i.e., NATO, CNWDI, SIOP, etc.)
       b. AF Form 2586, Unescorted Entry Authorization Certificate, stamped by Pass & Registration
Section, reflecting restricted area badge was returned.
        c. AF Form 2587, Security Termination Statement.
        d. Notification of suspension of access.
       My rationale for this decision is: Subject’s current situation (conduct, incident, status, pending
administrative or judicial action, etc.). Previous disciplinary problems/incidents and action taken, if any.
Subject’s duty performance. Any evaluations the subject has received. Any other pertinent information.
Subject’s retainability in the Air Force.
       To assist in resolving this case I’ve taken the following actions: requested investigation, referred
individual for evaluation, etc. We’ll keep your office informed of any developments and or changes.

not required when recording special access program authorizations, unless specified in the governing
directive. This guidance also applies to sections IV and V.
3. If the individual records derogatory information in Section VII, promptly notify the requester and secu-
rity information file custodians. This action determines if re-adjudication of the person’s security clear-
ance is necessary by the CAF. This guidance also applies to Section V.
4. Ensure the request process includes a review of SK for evidence of an UIF concerning the member.
Also, review personnel records to determine if derogatory information exists from a personnel security
standpoint. Check personnel records to confirm other data, such as employment or military service as
listed on SF Form 86, when necessary. Persons designated to sign Item 14 of the form must take or con-
firm these actions. Enter results of these reviews in Section VII.
5. Note that this authority may be delegated to other medical staff personnel who may review medical
records and form professional opinions based on the information being evaluated. If no medical records
are on file (as for many civil service
employees) annotate the form to that effect. The DD Form 1879 then shows no local medical records
were checked and DSS agents check the records.
6. Review the records of the security clearance function and reports and analysis section. If a SIF exists,
deny the requested personnel security action pending completion of adjudication actions. In these cases,
also enter in Section VII that a SIF exists. Also, review the remarks section for any other derogatory
information reported and evaluate the need to establish a SIF for further adjudication. Enter results of this
evaluation in Section VII.
7. Annotate Section VII to reflect what document was used to verify citizenship status.

                                          SMITH AMENDMENT

A24.1. Implementation of the Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States Code, to add a new section that precludes the
initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the DoD under four specific circumstances as out-
lined below.
      A24.1.1. Provision (1) disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and Federal courts, includ-
      ing UCMJ offenses, with sentences imposed of more than one year, regardless of the amount of time
      actually served
      A24.1.2. Provision (2) does not change the substance of the existing adjudication guideline relative to
      current drug involvement. Anyone who is currently an unlawful user of, or addicted to, a controlled
      substance.
      A24.1.3. Provision (3) does not change the substance of the adjudication guidelines for emotional,
      mental, or personality disorders. Anyone who is found to be mentally incompetent (incapable of safe-
      guarding classified information) by a credentialed mental health professional approved by DoD.
      A24.1.4. Provision (4) disqualifies persons who have been discharged or dismissed from the Armed
      Forces under dishonorable conditions.

A24.2. Secretary of the Air Force may authorize a waiver in meritorious cases under provisions (1) & (4).
Waiver authority is not delegable.

A24.3. Provision (2) & (3) disqualifies a person for eligibility for a security clearance and may not be
waived.

A24.4. Individuals that fall under the categories (1) through (4) will be afforded applicable due process
and appeal opportunity IAW the DoD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program and this instruction.

A24.5. When AFCAF issues a final statement of reasons to deny or revoke a security clearance in cases
where a waiver is allowed (provisions 1 and 4) the subject will be informed of the waiver provision, pro-
vided a copy of the statute and other information on how to respond. The subject must include in the
response to the statement of reasons if they want to be considered for a waiver, if applicable.

A24.6. Decision process for determining whether a particular case warrents a meritorious waiver:
      A24.6.1. The AFCAF is the first level nominating office and determines if the case warrants a meri-
      torious waiver under the provisions of the statute. If approved, the case is forwarded with the proposed
      request for waiver and full justification to the Air Force Personnel Security Appeal Board (PSAB) for
      review.
      A24.6.2. If the PSAB determines the case has meritorious justification, the case summary is returned
      to the AFCAF for forwarding to SAF/AA.
         A24.6.2.1. SAF/AA may disapprove the waiver request or forward it to the SECAF with recom-
         mendation for approval. Both the SAF/AA and SECAF decisions are final.
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                        107


A24.7. AFCAF will provide quarterly summaries to SAF/AA by the10th of each month following the end
of each calendar quarter of all waivers submitted to SECAF. SAF/AA provides report to USD/I by the
15th .

A24.8. The statute policy applies to:
   A24.8.1. All initial determinations to grant security clearance eligibility or access and determinations
   to continue clearance eligibility/accesses following a reinvestigation;
   A24.8.2. Existing clearances eligibility or access which a previous or other investigation reveals a
   previous favorably resolved issue involving one or more of the four statutory provisions, regardless of
   the presence or absence of subsequent disqualifying issues;
   A24.8.3. Previous and follow-on periodic reinvestigations and other investigations initiated for other
   reasons; such as:
       A24.8.3.1. Security Information File, Special Investigation Inquiry, etc., and all pending cases in
       which a final decision had not been issued as of 7 Jun 01.

A24.9. The statue polices do not apply to:
   A24.9.1. Conversions/transfers/reinstatements of current DoD security clearances, including trans-
   fers of clearances of employees within the DoD, clearances of employees who fall under the National
   Industrial Security Program, and transfers of clearances to the DoD of employees coming from other
   Federal agencies.

nel security investigations and appropriate questionnaire forms and or Electronic Personnel Security
Questionnaire (EPSQ) Software.
2.4.1. General. The investigations listed in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R and this instruction are the only

3.11. Interim Security Clearances. Commanders may grant interim security clearances for access to Top
Secret and Secret information when the requirements of DoD 5200.2-R, paragraph 3.401 have been met.
Use of local information and the following requirements provide Commanders with the necessary tools to
exercise their authority to grant interim security clearances. Also see Attachment 25, Table A25.1. for
guidance on the authority level to grant interim security clearance/access to specific programs.
3.11.1. Interim Top Secret security clearances:
3.11.1.1 Favorable ENTNAC, NAC, NACI, NACIC, NACLC, or ANACI completed.
3.11.1.2. Consult the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) to determine the existence of a favor-
able ENTNAC, NAC, NACI, NACIC, NACLC, or ANACI. The investigation is acceptable if there is no
break in service over two years.
3.11.1.3. Favorable review of personnel security questionnaire.
3.11.1.4. Favorable review of local personnel records, base and or security force records, medical records,
and other security records, as appropriate.
3.11.1.5. SSBI package has been submitted by an Authorized Requester to the investigative agency pro-
vider.
3.11.2. Commanders can grant interim Top Secret security clearance if the above provisions have been
met.
3.11.3. If there is no record of a completed investigation (NAC portion) in JPAS, contact Air Force Cen-
tral Adjudication Facility (AFCAF) Customer Support through JPAS to determine if there is a favorable
NAC. (Note Optional: Authorized requesters can request “Advanced NAC Results” from OPM on the
OPM Agency Use Sheet.)
3.11.4. Interim Secret security clearances:
3.11.4.1. Favorable review of personnel security questionnaire.
3.11.4.2. Favorable review of local personnel records, base and or security forces records, medical
records, and other security records, as appropriate.
112                                                              AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007


3.11.4.3. NACLC or ANACI has been submitted by an Authorized Requester to an investigative agency
provider.
3.11.5. Interim security clearances must be documented in JPAS or in writing if JPAS is unavailable, until
the final security clearance eligibility is granted by the AFCAF.
3.11.6. For Civilians:
3.11.6.1. Consult JPAS on a newly hired civilian for a previous security clearance/personnel security
investigation to determine if a previous security clearance was held as a former military member (without
a break in service of two years) or if a security clearance as either an Air Reserve Technician or as a tradi-
tional reservist was held.
3.11.6.2. Pending completion of ANACIs or SSBIs, as appropriate, civilians may occupy non-critical sen-
sitive or critical sensitive positions. Commanders prepare a waiver of pre-employment investigation
requirements when such action is necessary and in the national interest. Interim security clearance may
not be granted until after the commander signs the waiver memorandum.
3.11.7. JPAS is the source for determining investigative status on pending investigations. Also see para
7.9.


3.28. Periodic Reinvestigations (PR). PRs are required every 5 years for Top Secret and 10 years for
Secret. Authorized requesters submit requests for reinvestigations to the DoD Authorized Investigation
Provider as outlined in A2.2.2.1. See AFI 31-406, Applying North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
Protection Standards, for submission of PRs for NATO investigations.


3.29. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). Although such personnel normally only require a Secret
clearance, an SSBI is initially required due to training and assignments involving nuclear weapons. Per-
sons occupying an EOD position shall undergo a Secret PR on a five year recurring basis.


5.2. Authorized Requesters.
5.2.1. MAJCOM, field operating agency (FOA), or direct reporting unit (DRU) staffs designate autho-
rized requesters to initiate PSIs for their organization. As a general rule, the number of authorized request-
ers will be kept to the minimum number required to meet mission requirements. See Attachment 2 for
request procedures.
5.2.2. Authorized requesters provide the AFCAF with the name, telephone number, and office symbol of
individual(s) who may obtain security clearance and or investigative data on individuals within their orga-
nization and provide copy to respective MAJCOM. See para 6.1. for AFCAF address.
5.2.3. Authorized requesters may query the JCAVS or call the CAF Customer Support Section at DSN
754-1242/43 to determine investigative and/or adjudicative status.
5.2.4. Authorized requesters approve and submit personnel security questionnaires to the DoD Authorized
Personnel Investigation Provider according to Attachment 2.
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                            113


5.5. Priority Requests. The following sensitive programs are authorized priority processing service by
OPM:
5.5.1. PRP. In cases where a PRP “C” coded case warrants “Priority” service by OPM, the authorized
requester must coordinate the request through channels to AF/XOS-FI. Each authorized requester will
maintain a fiscal year (FY) Excel spreadsheet listing for this purpose. The spreadsheet will include all pre-
viously coordinated FY priority PSIs and all new requirements the authorized requester is coordinating
under this authority. When coordinating new priority cases, forward the entire FY spreadsheet to afx-
ofi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. AF/XOS-FI will return to the authorized requester for monitoring the
completion of the investigation.
5.5.2. SCI. When the NACLC adjudication date is less than 12 months (DCID 6/4, Annex A, para 5), the
servicing Authorized Requester will provide the servicing SSO a copy of the completed SF 86 for each
SSBI request with an SCI access requirement. This will be done at the same time the request for SSBI/SCI
is forwarded to OPM. Security Managers/SSOs/Authorized Requesters will expedite the processing of the
SSBI off the installation to OPM and request priority level of service. On the OPM Agency Use Sheet
annotate 30A in Block A. Also see AFMAN 14-304.


5.7. Dual Citizenship. A security concern could exist when a military member, DoD civilian, contractor,
or consultant is submitted for a personnel security investigation and they are a dual citizen and/or possess/
use a foreign passport.
5.7.1. Dual Citizenship. Dual citizenship in and of itself is not an automatic disqualifier for security clear-
ance eligibility. However, possession of dual citizenship and particularly the exercise of dual citizenship
is a condition that raises a security concern and may be a disqualifying factor in a security clearance eligi-
bility determination. There are factors that could mitigate the maintenance of dual citizenship, as outlined
in DoD 5200.2-R, App I, Foreign Preference. An individual’s expressed willingness to renounce dual cit-
izenship is one of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.
5.7.2. Possession or Use of a Foreign Passport. Possession and/or use of a foreign passport in preference
to a US passport raises doubt as to whether the person’s allegiance to the US is paramount and could also
facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the US. The security clearance will be denied or revoked, unless
the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from SAF/AA.
Requests for approval are forwarded through respective Information Security Program Manager (ISPM)
channels to HQ USAF/XOS-FI for processing to SAF/AA. Justification must include what benefit the AF
will gain from a person holding a foreign passport. AFCAF will annotate approvals in the remarks field of
the JPAS.
5.7.3. Surrendering the Passport. Individuals who indicate they possess a foreign passport in item 15 of
the Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire or item 17d on the Standard Form 86, “Questionnaire
for National Security Positions,” will be required to surrender the passport via one of the following
methods:
5.7.3.1. Return the passport to the appropriate country embassy or consulate via certified receipt mail. A
copy of the transmittal memo forwarding the passport and the return receipt will be forwarded to the
AFCAF. See para 6.1. for AFCAF address. If the name of adjudicator assigned to the case is known,
include this in the ATTN line of the address.
114                                                            AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007


5.7.3.2. Destroy the passport as witnessed by an AF security manager. Cut up the passport and place in a
burn bag. The witnessing security manager will document the destruction of the passport in an explana-
tory memorandum, which will be forwarded to the AFCAF and a copy provided to the subject.
5.7.4. Security Clearance Eligibility. In order for individuals who hold foreign passport and dual citizen-
ship to be considered for and/or be granted security clearance eligibility the following must be completed:
5.7.4.1. Provide a written statement expressing their willingness to renounce foreign citizenship claims in
favor of a sole United States citizenship status. Actual renouncement is not required.
5.7.4.2. Return and or destroy the passport.
5.7.5. The renouncement statement and documentation of destruction of the passport must be provided to
the AFCAF. The AFCAF reviews each case on its own merits to determine security clearance eligibility.
5.7.6. This same guidance will apply if the passport is identified after a security clearance determination
is made.


6.1. Central Adjudication Authority. The Air Force Central Adjudication Facility (AFCAF) is the Cen-
tral Adjudication Authority. Address is: AFCAF/PSA, 229 Brookely Ave, Bolling AFB 20032.
6.1.1. The policy and criteria set forth in DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, paragraph 2-200, 6-102 and Appen-
dix I will be applied in making personnel security determinations for a security clearance or assignment to
sensitive duties.
6.1.2. Unfavorable adjudication results in the denial/revocation of clearance eligibility (see Chapter 8).
6.1.3. The AFCAF will review all investigative products and make an eligibility determination.
6.1.4. AFCAF Customer Service will not release adverse information to inquiring customers on pending
investigations, as it invokes privacy act concerns. Derogatory issues are often resolved through comple-
tion of the investigation and or adjudication of the case. Premature dissemination of unresolved and or
un-adjudicated issues could result in discriminatory practices with respect to such areas as employments
or assignments.


6.2. Adjudicative Record. Personnel security determinations are reflected in the JPAS. JPAS replaced
Sentinel Key (SK) as used throughout AFI 31-501.


7.1. General
7.1.1. The AFCAF is the designated authority to grant, suspend, deny, or revoke personnel security clear-
ances and SCI accesses (see Chapter 11).


7.2. Investigative Requirements for Coding Positions. Commanders will:
7.2.1. Determine the type of investigation required for mission purposes for each military and civilian
position in the organization. Investigations are required for multiple purposes: to determine suitability
and/or trustworthiness of individual for employment/assignment to positions of trust/access to certain
programs; and for security clearance. Each position is coded with the appropriate position code reflecting
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                       115


the required investigation level in the unit manning document (UMD) and the Defense Civilian Personnel
Data System (DCPDS). These will also be reflected in the Headquarters Air Force Manpower Data Sys-
tem (HAF-MDS).
7.2.1.1. Assign one of the five investigation types to each position:
7.2.1. l.1. Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).
7.2.2.1.2. National Agency Check, Local Agency Checks and Credit (NACLC).
7.2.2.1.3. Access National Agency Check and Inquiries (ANACI).
7.2.2.1.4. National Agency Check Plus Inquiries (NACI)
7.2.2.1.5. National Agency Check (NAC).
7.2.1.2. The definitions and corresponding codes are located in Attachment 22, Table A22.1.
7.2.1.3. Conduct annual review to determine the accuracy of position coding. The last AF-wide directed
review was conducted in May 04. Reviews will be conducted each May. Retain results for review during
self inspections, etc.
7.2.1.4. Ensure only necessary investigations are requested to meet mission essential needs.
7.2.1.5. See Attachment 22 for additional guidance.


7.3. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs). HQ USAF/XOS-FI approves
requests for adding security clearances or investigations as AFSC prerequisites. Requests are staffed
through ISPM channels. AFMAN 36-2105, Officer Classification and AFMAN 36-2108, Enlisted Classi-
fication will reflect an SSBI requirement for entry, award, and retention for the respective mandatory
AFSCs. See Attachment 22; Table A22.2., A22.3.


7.4. Investigative Requirements for Sensitive Programs. There are several sensitive programs that
have been designated as a mandatory SSBI requirement, i.e., Presidential Support, Personnel Reliability
Program, etc. See Attachment 22, Table A22.4.


7.5. Investigative Requirements for Air Force Deployments, Operational or Contractual Exigen-
cies. This policy does not apply to SCI. Positions identified for deployments will, as a minimum, be
assigned a NACLC, requiring access to Secret information for the in-country threat briefing. SSBIs are
not authorized for purposes of Top Secret eligibility “just in case of” deployment. In these situations,
commanders grant interim Top Secret access for a period of up to 180 days. This can be renewed for
extended deployment purposes and for redeployment. Interim Top Secret access is granted for the purpose
of deployment based on the existing NACLC, and discontinued upon return to home station. SSBIs will
not be required for this purpose. Persons must be US citizens and have not had a break in service for more
than 24 months. Record of the interim TS is annotated in JPAS or in cases where it is not available, docu-
mented and maintained with security related documents. However, SSBI is authorized if a joint or theater
deployment requires a final Top Secret security clearance and will not accept interims, i.e., JCS contin-
gencies. These requirements need to be identified and positions coded IAW para 7.2. of this instruction.
116                                                            AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007


7.6. Approval Authorities for Additional/New/Upgrade of SSBIs. 3-Star/Civilian Equivalent authority
is required to approve any additional/new/upgrade SSBIs before the servicing Manpower Office codes the
positions on the UMD. Approval authorized can not be delegated. Approval authorities are as follows:
7.6.1. MAJCOMs: CV or NAF/CC
7.6.2. FOAs: parent 2-Ltr or SAF/AA or AF/CVA if the parent 2-Ltr is not at the appropriate grade level
7.6.3. DRUs: AF/CVA.
7.6.4. HQ USAF:
7.6.4.1. Air Staff: AF/CVA
7.6.4.2. Secretariate: SAF/AA.
7.6.5. Commands will establish internal certifying procedures. The approval documentation will be
retained by the Manpower Office for three years and is subject to compliance review by HQ AFIA or their
designee. Approval will increase MAJCOM funds withhold for personnel security investigations through
the FYDP.


7.7. Periodic Reinvestigations. Periodic Reinvestigations will be kept current for incumbents assigned
against positions coded as requiring SSBI and NACLC/ANACI. Also see para A2.7.


7.8. Issuing Security Clearance Eligibility. AFCAF issues security clearance eligibility and enters the
determination into JPAS.


7.9. The Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). JPAS is the Department of Defense (DoD) per-
sonnel security clearance and access database. It facilitates personnel security management for the DoD
Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF), security managers, and offers both non-SCI and SCI functions. It
interfaces with the investigative providers, the personnel systems within the Department thus eliminating
manual transactions and expediting the flow of personnel security information to warfighters.
7.9.1 JPAS is the primary source for determining investigative data/status of investigations on individuals
in the DoD. JPAS allows communication between the CAFs and its customers. All information in JPAS is
unclassified, but must be protected according to the requirements for privacy/sensitive information and
For Official Use Only (FOUO) in accordance with AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program and
DoDR 5400.7/AF Supplement, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program.
7.9.2. JPAS has two applications: The Joint Adjudication Management System (JAMS) and Joint Clear-
ance and Access Verification System (JCAVS)
7.9.2.1. JAMS is for adjudicative personnel only and provides capabilities such as case management/dis-
tribution, adjudication decisions, adjudicative history and summary, due process, and future ability for
each CAF to electronically access investigative reports from the investigative providers.
7.9.2.1.1. JAMS replaced the Adjudicative Management System (AMS), as used throughout this instruc-
tion.
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                          117


7.9.2.2. JCAVS is for non-SCI and SCI security managers/officers and authorized requesters and provides
capabilities such as access indoctrination/debriefing history, incident/issue file reporting, history and
management of unit personnel security functions.
7.9.2.2.1. JCAVS replaced Clearance and Access Verification System (CAVS), as used throughout this
instruction.
7.9.3. ISPMs determine the number of users and the access levels for each user. Clearance data elements
in the JCAVS include the full date and type of investigation and the full date and status of security clear-
ance. The information is invalid when any of these four data elements are incomplete.
7.9.3.1. Use the most current highest level eligibility recorded in the JCAVS when more than one entry
appears for an individual.
7.9.3.2. The term “DCID 6/4 (formerly DCID 1/14)” means the person has been the subject of a SSBI, has
been granted a Top Secret security clearance eligibility, is eligible for SCI access if required for mission
essential purposes and may already have SCI access. See AFMAN 14-304.
7.9.4. The JCAVS will provide the following information:
7.9.4.1. An individual’s security clearance eligibility level and access level.
7.9.4.2. Visit notification.
7.9.4.3. Suspension notification.
7.9.4.4. SCI indoctrination, nondisclosure statement, and debriefing dates
7.9.4.5. Establishment of a SIF.
7.9.6. JCAVS User Levels are as follows:
7.9.6.1. Level 2 - SCI security personnel at unified command, DoD agency, military installation or major
command/equivalent headquarters. Personnel Security Management (PSM) - Net is determined by the
responsible SOIC or designee. (Read and Write Access - SSBI/DCID 6/4 with current SCI Access.)
7.9.6.2. Level 3 - SCI security personnel at echelons subordinate to Level 2 at a particular geographic
location (installation, base, post, naval vessel). PSM - Net is determined by the responsible SOIC or des-
ignee. (Read and Write Access - SSBI/DCID 6/4 with current SCI Access.)
7.9.6.3. Level 4 - Non-SCI security personnel at unified command, DoD agency, military department or
major command/equivalent headquarters. PSM - Net is determined by the responsible Security Officer or
designee. (Read and Write Access - NACLAC/ANACI/Secret Eligibility.)
7.9.6.4. Level 5 - Non-SCI security personnel at echelons subordinate to Level 4 at geographic location
(installation, base, post, naval vessel). PSM - Net is determined by the responsible Security Officer or des-
ignee. (Read and Write Access - NACLC/ANACI/Secret Eligibility.)
7.9.6.5. Level 6 - Unit Security Manager (additional duty) responsible for security functions as deter-
mined by responsible senior security official. (Read and Write Access - NACLC/ANACI/Secret Eligibil-
ity.)
7.9.6.6. Level 7 - Non-SCI Entry Control Personnel. Individuals who grant access to installations, build-
ings, etc. Varies according to organizations. (Read Access - NACLC/ANACI/Secret Eligibility.)
118                                                              AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007


7.9.6.7. Level 8 - SCI Entry Control Personnel. Individuals who grant access to SCIF installations, build-
ings, etc. Varies according to organizations. (Read Access - SSBI/DCID 6/4 Eligibility.)
7.9.6.8. Level 10 - Visitor Management. Level 10 users will have the same view of the JCAVS Personnel
Summary as a JCAVS Level 7 User. They will receive Visit Notification when their Security Management
Office (SMO) is being notified of a visit. A Level 10 User may not be an account manager to create or
delete an account at any level. NACLC/ANACI/Secret Eligibility.

JPAS web site is: https://jpas.osd.mil Requests for changes to JPAS may be made on-line at https://
jpas.osd.mil.


7.11. Granting Access. Commanders grant access to classified information when a mission essential need
exists and only when all of the following prerequisites are met: (1) individual has the appropriate security
clearance eligibility; (2) individual has signed an SF 312 (see AFI 31-401); and (3) individual has a
need-to-know. Authorized base level users will record access in the JCAVS. See Chapter 3 for other sit-
uations when access to classified information may be granted.


7.12. Obtaining Information from the AFCAF.
7.12.1. Authorized requesters may contact the AFCAF Customer Support Section through JPAS. In situa-
tions where no security clearance data is available at the unit, no information is available in the JCAVS,
and the AFCAF has valid security clearance information on file, a record of the call will be used as evi-
dence of valid clearance data pending update of the JCAVS. The authorized requester prepares a memo-
randum for record (MFR) showing: (1) name, grade, and organization of the individual calling the
AFCAF; (2) name, grade, organization, and SSN of the subject; (3) name of person at the AFCAF provid-
ing clearance eligibility data, and (4) type and date of investigation and, if granted, level and date of secu-
rity clearance eligibility. Also see para 6.1.
7.12.1.1. The authorized requester forwards a copy of the MFR to the individual's security manager.
7.12.1.2. The authorized requester and the security manager keep the MFR until JCAVS is updated to
show the data addressed in the MFR.


8.1.2. Reporting Government Charge Card Abuses and Misuse. Security Officials, AFOSI, or AF Govern-
ment Charge Card program coordinators are required to immediately report Government Charge Card
abuses and misuses to the appropriate commander. This information constitutes serious questions as to the
individual’s ability or intent to protect classified information or execute sensitive duties. The commander
will make an immediate determination to either leave the individual’s security status unchanged or sus-
pend their access to classified information or assignment to sensitive duties until the appropriate authority
makes a final determination regarding the individual’s eligibility to retain a security clearance. In addi-
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                          119


tion, commanders may take action in accordance with Chapter 8, to determine if a SIF should be estab-
lished and/or the person’s access to classified information should be suspended.


8.1.3. Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances as Mandated by
the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 – Smith Amendment.
Attachment 24 outlines the instructions.

SMITH AMENDMENT
A24.1. Implementation of the Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act
for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States Code, to add a new section that precludes the
initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the DoD under four specific circumstances as out-
lined below.
A24.1.1. Provision (1) disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and Federal courts, including
UCMJ offenses, with sentences imposed of more than one year, regardless of the amount of time actually
served
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                         131


A24.1.2. Provision (2) does not change the substance of the existing adjudication guideline relative to cur-
rent drug involvement. Anyone who is currently an unlawful user of, or addicted to, a controlled sub-
stance.
A24.1.3. Provision (3) does not change the substance of the adjudication guidelines for emotional, mental,
or personality disorders. Anyone who is found to be mentally incompetent (incapable of safeguarding
classified information) by a credentialed mental health professional approved by DoD.
A24.1.4. Provision (4) disqualifies persons who have been discharged or dismissed from the Armed
Forces under dishonorable conditions.
A24.2. Secretary of the Air Force may authorize a waiver in meritorious cases under provisions (1) & (4).
Waiver authority is not delegable.
A24.3. Provision (2) & (3) disqualifies a person for eligibility for a security clearance and may not be
waived.
A24.4. Individuals that fall under the categories (1) through (4) will be afforded applicable due process
and appeal opportunity IAW the DoD 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program and this instruction.
A24.5. When AFCAF issues a final statement of reasons to deny or revoke a security clearance in cases
where a waiver is allowed (provisions 1 and 4) the subject will be informed of the waiver provision, pro-
vided a copy of the statute and other information on how to respond. The subject must include in the
response to the statement of reasons if they want to be considered for a waiver, if applicable.
A24.6. Decision process for determining whether a particular case warrents a meritorious waiver:
A24.6.1. The AFCAF is the first level nominating office and determines if the case warrants a meritorious
waiver under the provisions of the statute. If approved, the case is forwarded with the proposed request for
waiver and full justification to the Air Force Personnel Security Appeal Board (PSAB) for review.
A24.6.2. If the PSAB determines the case has meritorious justification, the case summary is returned to
the AFCAF for forwarding to SAF/AA.
A24.6.2.1. SAF/AA may disapprove the waiver request or forward it to the SECAF with recommendation
for approval. Both the SAF/AA and SECAF decisions are final.
A24.7. AFCAF will provide quarterly summaries to SAF/AA by the10th of each month following the end
of each calendar quarter of all waivers submitted to SECAF. SAF/AA provides report to USD/I by the
15th .
A24.8. The statute policy applies to:
A24.8.1. All initial determinations to grant security clearance eligibility or access and determinations to
continue clearance eligibility/accesses following a reinvestigation;
A24.8.2. Existing clearances eligibility or access which a previous or other investigation reveals a previ-
ous favorably resolved issue involving one or more of the four statutory provisions, regardless of the pres-
ence or absence of subsequent disqualifying issues;
A24.8.3. Previous and follow-on periodic reinvestigations and other investigations initiated for other rea-
sons; such as:
A24.8.3.1. Security Information File, Special Investigation Inquiry, etc., and all pending cases in which a
final decision had not been issued as of 7 Jun 01.
132                                                            AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007


A24.9. The statue polices do not apply to:
A24.9.1. Conversions/transfers/reinstatements of current DoD security clearances, including transfers of
clearances of employees within the DoD, clearances of employees who fall under the National Industrial
Security Program, and transfers of clearances to the DoD of employees coming from other Federal agen-
cies.

                                    Attachment 27 (Added-AETC)

 QUESTIONS FOR FOREIGN CONNECTIONS OR VULNERABILITY TO BLACKMAIL OR
                             COERCION
Note: Questions relating to "relatives" mean immediate family members (spouses, cohabitant, children,
mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, stepbrothers, stepsisters, and stepparents). Immediate family members
are those who live in a foreign country or who live in the United States but are not US citizens.
A27.1. (Added-AETC) Blackmail. Have you previously been or are you now being blackmailed, pres-
sured, or coerced by any foreign individual, group, association, organization, or government to work for
them or obtain information about the United States?
NOTE: A “yes” answer should be disqualifying for a sensitive skills AFSC if it relates to military or non-
military information that provides the foreign entity information releasing US military information, tech-
nology, or patented nonmilitary information. It may also be disqualifying for Air Force enlistment.
      A27.1.1. (Added-AETC) Have you been targeted and/or approached for possible blackmail or coer-
      cion or been pressured by any foreign individual, group, association, organization, or government?
NOTE: A "yes" answer should be disqualifying for a sensitive skills AFSC if information released con-
tained military information and/or technology or nonmilitary-patented information. It may also be dis-
qualifying for Air Force enlistment.
A27.2. (Added-AETC) Relatives. Are relatives who are employed by (or in any way connected with)
any foreign government in an official capacity (for example, a foreign government contract related to mil-
itary applications) representing the foreign government at meetings, conferences, or symposiums relating
to intelligence or other military matters?
NOTE: A “yes” answer must be explored further and the individual asked if he or she can be black-
mailed, coerced, or pressured by any foreign government interest to commit an act not in the best interest
of the United States or his or her position as a US military member. A “yes” answer should be disqualify-
ing for a sensitive skills AFSC and probably for Air Force enlistment.
      A27.2.1. (Added-AETC) To your knowledge, are any of your relatives associated with any
      employee of a foreign intelligence service?
NOTE: A “yes” answer must be explored further. Ask the individual if he or she can be blackmailed,
coerced, or pressured by any foreign government intelligence service to commit an act not in the best
interest of the United States in his or her position as a US military member. A “yes” answer should be dis-
qualifying for a sensitive skills AFSC and probably for Air Force enlistment.
      A27.2.2. (Added-AETC) To your knowledge, are any of your relatives engaged in any conduct that
      could make you vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign government?
NOTE: A “yes” answer needs to be explored. If the individual can be subjected to coercion, exploitation,
or pressured by a foreign government, try to learn the reason. A “yes” answer should be disqualifying for
a sensitive skills AFSC and probably for Air Force enlistment.
      A27.2.3. (Added-AETC) What is the nature and extent of your contact with your relatives who are
      not US citizens?
AFI31-501_AETCSUP_I 24 MAY 2007                                                                          135


NOTE: Visiting, telephoning, writing letters, or other electronic forms of communication are not disqual-
ifying factors if there are no efforts by relatives to subject the individuals to coercion, exploitation, or
pressure to support the goals of the foreign government.
A27.3. (Added-AETC) Passports. Do you possess or use a foreign passport?
NOTE: Security clearances are not granted to dual citizens with a foreign passport, immigrant aliens or
foreign nationals. Only military members who are U.S. citizens are granted a security clearance on com-
pletion of a favorable background investigation. A person who uses a foreign passport is either a dual cit-
izen or foreign national. Do not place these persons in a sensitive skill AFSC or any position requiring a
clearance unless they surrender the foreign passport and express a willingness to denounce dual citizen-
ships. Verify the documentation that shows the individual is a U.S. citizen.
A27.4. (Added-AETC) Financial Interest. Does any relative have a substantial financial interest in any
foreign-owned or foreign-operated business that could make you vulnerable to foreign influence?
NOTE: If the answer is “yes,” attempt to find out why the individual could be influenced by foreign
interests. Do not place such an individual into a sensitive skill AFSC. This person may not be suitable for
Air Force enlistment.
A27.5. (Added-AETC) Bearing Arms. If necessary, would you be willing to bear arms against any for-
eign country, including the country of which any relatives are citizens?
NOTE: A “no” answer bears further consideration. If the individual is not willing to fulfill military
enlistment oath statements, he or she will not be placed in a sensitive skill AFSC. In addition, the individ-
ual should be evaluated for enlistment or retention.
A27.6. (Added-AETC) Intelligence. If required, would you be willing to engage in US intelligence
activities against any foreign country, including the country of which any relatives are citizens?
NOTE: If the answer is “no” do not place the individual into a sensitive skill intelligence AFSC. How-
ever, this does not prevent the individual from being placed in another sensitive skill AFSC, if qualified.
A27.7. (Added-AETC) Foreign Benefits. Are you subject to accepting or receiving educational, medi-
cal, or other benefits (for example, retirement, social welfare) from a foreign government?
NOTE: A "yes" answer is not disqualifying if the individual is not subject to coercion, exploitation,
blackmail, or pressure by the foreign government.
A27.8. (Added-AETC) Foreign Ties and Affection. Because of your ties of affection or obligation to a
foreign country, is there any condition to which you would agree or, through foreign influence, an act you
would commit that would not be in the best interest of the United States or your position as a US military
member?
NOTE: A "yes" answer should be reason for not placing the individual in a sensitive skill AFSC. In addi-
tion, he or she should be evaluated for Air Force retention.
