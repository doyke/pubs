AFI 33-106, 1 September 1997, is supplemented as follows. This supplement establishes policies and
defines procedures and responsibilities needed to implement proper management of cellular telephone
and pager assets in accordance with AFI 33-106, Managing High Frequency Radios, Land Mobile Radios,
Cellular Telephones, and Military Affiliated Radio Systems, AFI 33-111, Telephone System Management,
and AFI 33-219, Telecommunications Monitoring and Assessment Program (TMAP). This supplement
applies to all personnel and organizations assigned to the 4th Fighter Wing.

                                       CHAPTER 19 (ADDED)

                                 REQUIREMENTS PROCESSING

19.1. It is the responsibility of the base Communication-Information Systems Officer (CSO) to ensure all
Cellular Telephone (CT) requirements are properly analyzed and evaluated.
19.2. Each request for a CT must have a security risk assessment performed and have a technical solution
prepared. A cost comparison must also be performed to address the feasibility and cost of using a pager,
Land Mobile Radio or CT. The analysis will include a life cycle cost estimate for each alternative deter-
mined feasible. The 4th CS Plans and Program Flight (4 CS/SCX) is responsible for performing risk
assessment. The 4th CS Land Mobile Radio (4 CS/SCML) is responsible for performing technical solu-
tion, cost comparison, and life cycle cost estimate.
19.3. CTs are for official government administrative business and are managed according to the direc-
tives and guidelines governing management of telephone systems in AFI 33-111. Requests for CTs will
not be approved in areas where classified, sensitive, or critical information may be inadvertently over-
heard and transmitted. The CTs are for administrative requirements only. Secure CT unit-III will be used
to satisfy operational mission requirements only when time constraints prevent the use of other secure
means. Attachment 5 will be used to verify each CT requirement. (Attachment 5 below is taken from
AFI 33-106)
19.4. All new CT requests should be coordinated through 4 CS/SCX and 4 CS/SCX will forward require-
ment to 4 CS/SCML for technical solution. Since CT will be funded using wing or unit funds, all requests
need to be approved by the using unit’s Squadron Commander with funding line already approved prior to
coordination with 4 CS/SCX. If phones are to be wing-funded, the organization must obtain 4 FW/CPTS
POC to transfer funds into 4 CS account. Currently only phones listed in Attachment 10 (Added) are
wing-funded phones.
19.5. The 4th CS Commander will validate and approve all CT requests.
 All using organization commanders or designated representatives must annually revalidate the unit’s
requirement to determine if CT is still necessary and forward to 4 CS/SCML.

                                       CHAPTER 20 (ADDED)

                                             AQUISITION

20.1. The 4 CS is responsible for managing all CT assets and ensuring acquisition of CT assets and ser-
vices follow existing MAJCOM procedures for requesting and approving mobile communication require-
ments.
20.2. 4 CS/SCML is responsible for establishing and managing CT service for all CT assigned to Sey-
mour Johnson AFB. 4 CS/SCML will coordinate with base contracting to activate commercial CT ser-
vice. All CT assigned to Seymour Johnson AFB must use the commercial service selected and managed
by 4 CS/SCML.
20.3. All CT assets, initial or replacement purchases must be coordinated through 4 CS/SCML. 4 CS/
SCML is responsible for managing and tracking all CT assets in accordance with AFI 33-106. Any CT
assets no longer needed, or no longer operational, will be turned into 4CS/SCML for disposition.
20.3.1. CT units will not be replaced for convenience only. Operational changes must drive the request.
20.3.2. SCML will compile all wing funded CT requirements, and this office will prepare a CT financial
plan for the next fiscal year. Modifications to service and instrument types will be made only if they are
advantageous to the government.
20.4. Prior to obtaining CT assets 4 CS/SCML will brief all users on proper use of CT to include OPSEC
and consent to monitoring in accordance with AFI 33-219

                                       CHAPTER 21 (ADDED)

                                               BILLING

21.1. To minimize CT bills, use regular telephones (land lines) as a first priority when and where avail-
able. Cellular calls generally are more expensive, and CT use should be limited accordingly.
21.2. It is the responsibility of each customer to verify his or her monthly CT bills. Each customer must
send AF Form 649, Verification of Long Distance Telephone Calls, to 4 CS/SCML each month con-
firming the CT was used for official business. Any calls made not for official use need to reimbursed to
the US Government. Any accounts delinquent over 90 days in sending AF Form 649 will be contacted
and their accounts may be deactivated.
21.3. The 4 CS will only pay the CT cost for phones approved by the 4 FW/CC, IAW AFI 33-106/SJ SUP
1 Attachment 10 (Added). All other CT assets are the responsibility for individual units to fund.
21.4. Use CT for official business only. While an occasional personal call on a CT is justified under some
circumstances (e.g., call home to inform a spouse of member’s whereabouts when delayed by official
business or in emergency situations), you must keep track of, and reimburse the government for personal
calls made on a CT. All reimbursements should be coordinated through 4 CS/SCML. Personal calls on
your government cell phone should be the exception, not the rule.

                 CELLULAR TELEPHONE ACQUISITION DECISION MATRIX
A5.7. (Added) Does the requirement document specify that the primary use is for Command & Control
Communications? (If "YES," look for a technical solution other than a cellular telephone. If "NO," pro-
ceed to the next paragraph.)
A5.8. (Added) Does the requirement document identify a need for transmission/reception of Classified,
or Sensitive Unclassified Information in a mobile environment? (If "YES," look at a portable/mobile
STU-III technical solution rather than a conventional cellular instrument. If "NO," proceed to the next
paragraph.)
A5.9. (Added) Does satisfaction of this requirement with a cellular telephone result in the net reduction
in the number of LMRs or pagers in use on the base? (If "YES," examine paragraphs A4. and A5. If "NO,"
proceed to paragraph A5.6.)
A5.10. (Added) Does the requirement document identify a mission that was previously satisfied by an
LMR or pager? (If "YES," proceed to paragraph A5. If "NO," proceed to paragraph A6.)
A5.11. (Added) What aspect of the original mission has changed, which makes the continued use of LMR
or pagers unworkable? (If the requirement is essentially the same as before and convenience is the pri-
mary reason for the request, acquisition of a cellular telephone is not warranted. If there is a substantial
change to the mission, proceed to paragraph A6.)
A5.12. (Added) Is there a Serious Mission Degradation, Failure, or Life and Death Impact not previously
present that you cannot meet through the use of LMRs or pagers? (If "YES," consider the applicability of
cellular instruments. If "NO," look for a technical solution other than cellular telephone.)
