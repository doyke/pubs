SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision incorporates Changes 1 and 2 to AFI 11-401, 7 Mar 2007, removes HARM-
specific procedural guidance throughout the AFI (migrates to AFI 11-421), clarifies HAF and
MAJCOM responsibilities (1.2 and 1.3), provides MEP guidance (1.6.2.5 and Attachment 1)
updates orientation flight guidance (Table 1.1), updates guidance on commander flights with
MEP on board (1.12.4.1) and guidance on general officer flights with passengers or MEP on
board (1.12.4.2 and 1.12.4.3), updates ACIP entitlement information (Figure 2.1), updates
OFDA requirements (Table 2.7) and deletes Transition Status Codes, updates OFDA waiver
guidance (2.6), updates guidance on performance of flying duties (2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10), revises
general officer flying guidance (2.12.3.1, 2.14.5.1), adds RPA Time guidance (3.2.3.1), updates
General Officer Flying Hour Information Report requirements (3.15), updates the Aircrew and
MEP definitions (Attachment 1), and makes administrative changes throughout the AFI.

(AFGSC) This rewrite of AFI 11-401_AFGSCSUP replaces the DD MMM 11 IC2 supplement
in its entirety and must therefore be thoroughly reviewed in its entirety. Significant changes
include: Significant rewrite of parent AFI removed ARMS related data, transferring that
information from AFI11-401 to AFI11-421 as supplemented. While much of the data from the
previous version of AFI11-401 is still present in the new parent AFI and this supplement,
paragraph reference numbers have changed in many cases. Changes apply to all AFGSC B-52,
B-2, T-38A, and UH-1N aircraft.

                                          Chapter 1

     RESPONSIBILITY AND OBLIGATIONS, FLIGHT AUTHORIZATIONS, AND
                      FOREIGN MILITARY FLYING

Section 1A—Responsibilities and Obligations

1.1. Overview. The policies and requirements of this instruction apply to all personnel who fly
onboard Air Force aircraft, and their commanders. In addition, it provides guidance on the Jump
Record Folder (JRF), Aviation Service Codes (ASC), and flight authorization (FA) codes in
Table A2.3 for Air Force parachutists. Further guidance on parachutist policies and requirements
can be found in AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute Operations.
1.1. (AFGSC)Who Must Comply. This supplement applies to AFGSC assigned and attached
aircrew and parachutists. It applies to all AFGSC units, as well as Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC) units when gained by AFGSC and Air National Guard (ANG) units when mobilized.
This supplement also applies to members of other commands, direct reporting units (DRUs), and
field operating agencies (FOA) (assigned and attached) when performing crew duties in AFGSC
aircraft and under AFGSC oversight (ANG/AFRC). Host Aviation Resource Management
(HARM) offices servicing tenant units will establish and review annually all host-tenant support
agreements IAW AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management.
1.2. Responsibilities of AF/A3O-A. The Director of Air Operations (AF/A3O-A):
   1.2.1. Through the DCS, Operations, Plans and Requirements (AF/A3/5), and the Director of
   Operations (AF/A3O), establishes and monitors the Air Force flying program as outlined in
   this instruction to ensure effective use of resources. Unless otherwise specified in this
   instruction, AF/A3O-A is the waiver authority for this instruction. (See paragraph 1.7 for
   waiver guidance.)
   1.2.2. Assigns AF/A3O-AT as the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for this
   instruction.
1.3. Responsibilities of MAJCOMs. (For purposes of this instruction, ANG is considered a
MAJCOM, except as provided otherwise.) MAJCOM/A3s will provide oversight of MAJCOM
flying programs. MAJCOMs will establish a system to carry out the requirements of this
instruction and meet training and operational needs of the Air Force.
1.3. (AFGSC)Training and Stan/Eval (HQ AFGSC/A3T) has overall responsibility for this
supplement. The office of primary responsibility (OPR) is the Flight Management Branch (HQ
AFGSC/A3TA). Wherever the basic instruction requires ―MAJCOM approval‖ the approval
level will be HQ AFGSC/A3, unless otherwise specified.
   1.3.1. MAJCOM Commanders will prohibit any agency or unit from operating or
   maintaining an aircraft that does not have an established system program director. Waiver
   authority is MAJCOM/A3; coordinate waivers with MAJCOM/A4. Aircraft procured
   through non-DoD resources will not be flown or operated by USAF units without MAJCOM
   approval.
8                                                   AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


    1.3.2. MAJCOM Commanders may direct grounding of MDS-specific or all aircraft within
    their commands for maintenance reasons. When a MAJCOM has lead command aircraft
    responsibility, MAJCOM commanders may recommend grounding of all aircraft within an
    MDS-specific fleet. MAJCOM Commanders may also direct a stand-down of aircrew
    personnel when warranted by operational considerations, in conjunction with aircraft
    grounding or as a separate action. A stand-down has no immediate impact on the operational
    status of any unit aircraft; it is the result of an operational unit commander directing unit
    aircrews not to fly for a specific reason. A stand-down provides the commander time to
    assess an incident or finding and actions required to safely resume operations. Notification
    will be provided IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. See also AFI 21-101, Aircraft
    and Equipment Maintenance Management, for additional guidance. Return to normal
    operations will be initiated by the commander directing the original grounding/stand-down.
    Authority for grounding and/or stand-down may be delegated by MAJCOMs in supplements
    to this and other governing AFIs, but not lower than MAJCOM/A3/A4.
    1.3.2. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3, in close coordination with HQ AFGSC/A4, is the focal
    point for all issues related to grounding and stand-down.
       1.3.2.1. The Director, Air National Guard (DANG), may ground United States Air Force
       aircraft assigned to the Air National Guard (ANG) and stand-down ANG aircrews. The
       DANG will coordinate any grounding or stand-down decisions with the Chief, National
       Guard Bureau. When the DANG exercises this authority to ground aircraft, the Secretary
       of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force will be notified as soon as
       practicable. No further delegation of this authority is authorized.
       1.3.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3 Responsibilities. After receiving notification
       of conditions that might warrant a fleet-wide grounding or stand-down, the HQ
       AFGSC/A3 will:
           1.3.2.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Determine impact of operational capability worldwide.
           1.3.2.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) Inform other Major Command (MAJCOM)/A3s if
           grounding was due to a maintenance issue that has implications to affect the weapon
           system fleet-wide.
           1.3.2.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) Inform Air Force Personnel Center/Directorate of
           Aerospace Expeditionary & Personnel Operations (AFPC/DPW) and HQ
           ACC/A3O/A3C if grounding affects the capability to contribute to joint or
           contingency operations.
           1.3.2.2.4. (Added-AFGSC) Coordinate with HQ AFGSC/A4 and HQ AFGSC/SE to
           provide advice/direction to the unit as necessary.
           1.3.2.2.5. (Added-AFGSC) Inform Commander, Air Force Global Strike Command
           (AFGSC/CC).
       1.3.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A4 Responsibilities. After being notified of a
       grounding, the HQ AFGSC/A4 will:
           1.3.2.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) . Determine if reporting to HAF/A4 is required under
           guidelines for Logistics Information reporting to CSAF, and take appropriate actions
           to transmit required report(s).
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                           9


        1.3.2.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) Notify Weapons System Team (WST) of grounded
        weapon system and verify System Sustainment Manager and/or System Program
        manager was notified.
        1.3.2.3.3. (Added-AFGSC) Inform other MAJCOM/A4s if grounding was due to a
        maintenance issue that has implications to affect the weapon system fleet-wide.
     1.3.2.4. (Added-AFGSC) Wing Commander Responsibilities:
        1.3.2.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) In addition to AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting
        Requirements, the following offices will be notified within 2 hours of the grounding:
        Numbered Air Force (NAF)/CC/A3; HQ AFGSC/A3; HQ AFGSC/A4 (if grounding
        was for a maintenance reason); HQ AFGSC/SE (if grounding was for safety of flight
        reasons); MDS System Program Office (SPO) (if grounding was for a maintenance
        reason that has implications fleet-wide).
        1.3.2.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) Notification will include the following information:
        Reason for grounding; Immediate actions taken to ensure safety of personnel and
        assets; Impact to current operations (both training and contingency related); Expected
        time frame until resumption of operations.
        1.3.2.4.3. (Added-AFGSC) Figure 1.1 provides some strategic level considerations
        that should be taken into account as appropriate to the situation at hand.

Figure 1.1. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC Major Ops Event Considerations




   1.3.3. Interfly Guidance. Lead MAJCOMs will place interfly guidance (if applicable) in AFI
   11-2MDS-Specific, Volumes 3. As required, establish additional interfly guidance in
   MAJCOM supplements to this AFI. Prior to the flight, ensure interfly agreements are
   approved and all unit coordination is complete. Ensure required information is provided to
   members Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) offices.
   1.3.3. (AFGSC) If specific guidance regarding interfly procedures is not provided in the
   AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3, units will fly aircrew and other military members according to
   paragraph 1.10 of the basic AFI 11-401 and obtain OG/CC to OG/CC written approval. If the
   interfly approval is time-driven, or an emergency situation exists (i.e. emergency
   evacuation), verbal approval from the unit commander, or higher, is authorized. In such
   cases, the unit commander or officer giving approval will place a signed approval statement
   on the Flight Authorization prior to flight. In all cases, interfly aircrew will be qualified in the
   MDS.
   1.3.4. Ensure no aircrew member is assigned Flying Status Code (FSC) S (Table 2.6)
   (except Duty Not Involving Flying [DNIF] members) or assigned ASC 04 (Table 2.5)
   beyond 180 days without being disqualified for aviation service, returned to flying/ground
   based radar duties, or reassigned to non-flying status/duty. MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent is
   the waiver authority for the 180-day limit. MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority to extend
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                              11


   members in this status beyond 365 days. Send information copy to AF/A3O-AT for all cases
   waived beyond 365 days. Note: For members previously in DNIF status, the 180-day period
   begins on the date the member was cleared to perform flying duties.
   1.3.4. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3TA will review and staff ASC "04" and FSC "S" waiver
   requests to HQ AFGSC/A3T or A3, as appropriate.
   1.3.5. Ensure FSC K (Table 2.6) is used only for aircrew members assigned to an active
   Aircrew Position Indicator (API), but not authorized to fly due to lack of resources (aircraft,
   flying hours, etc.). To ensure the requirement for active flying is still valid, each position
   occupied by a member assigned FSC K must be revalidated by the MAJCOM/A3 at the end
   of each fiscal year. The member‘s commander will submit a request for revalidation through
   group channels for MAJCOM/A3 approval. Upon completion of the revalidation, send
   notification to the member‘s Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) office
   authorizing the continuance of FSC K. Send an information copy to AF/A3O-AT. See
   paragraph 1.4.1.9 for additional guidance. EXCEPTION: MAJCOM/A3 revalidation is not
   required for FSC K assigned to members deployed to a non-flying assignment.
   1.3.5. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3TA will staff FSC-K revalidation requests to AFGSC/A3,
   and will notify member‘s HARM office and AF/A3O-AT of AFGSC/A3
   approval/disapproval.
       1.3.5.1. FSC K is not authorized when aircrew members are double billeted due to
       permanent change of station (PCS) or permanent change of assignment (PCA) actions.
   1.3.6. Review all cases when a rated officer with longer than 18 years of aviation service and
   assigned to an active flying position, or a CEA with longer than 20 years of aviation service
   and assigned to an active flying position, has not flown for 180 days and is not in suspension,
   disqualification, or DNIF status. Review will determine whether the member should be
   disqualified from aviation service, reassigned to an inactive flying position, or returned to
   flying. Note: For members previously in DNIF status or assigned ASC 04, the 180-day
   period begins on the date the member was cleared to perform flying duties.
   1.3.7. The serving HARM office will monitor double billeting management IAW paragraph
   1.4.2.1 and provide a monthly report to the applicable MAJCOM/A3T. The MAJCOM/A3T
   will facilitate waiver request or aviation management actions with the servicing HARM
   office.
   1.3.8. IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, MAJCOMs supplementing
   this AFI must rewrite, update (using an interim change [IC]), or certify supplements as
   current within 180 days of the publication of this AFI and whenever this AFI is updated
   (either by an IC or a rewrite). If the prior supplement conflicts with the current version of
   this AFI, the supplement must be immediately rescinded. Ensure subordinate organizations
   update supplements when higher headquarters publications are updated. See AFI 33-360 for
   specific guidance.
1.4. Responsibilities of Subordinate Organizations.
   1.4.1. Commanders are responsible for compliance with the requirements of this instruction.
   Commanders will:
12                                               AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


     1.4.1.1. Issue orders and supervise all personnel assigned or attached to their command
     for flying duties.
     1.4.1.2. Establish procedures to ensure all flights are reviewed for flight feasibility.
     Commanders may direct a stand-down of unit flying operations when warranted by
     maintenance, operational, or safety considerations. Provide notification IAW AFI 10-206,
     Operational Reporting.
     1.4.1.2. (AFGSC) Authority to direct a stand-down of flying operations rests with the
     wing commander for the reasons cited in the parent paragraph. Additionally, a wing
     commander has the authority to ground assigned aircraft IAW AFI 21-101 para 14.3.3.
     These authorities do not apply to assigned forces or aircraft that have been chopped to
     another command. Only the owning command has the authority to ground or direct
     stand-down of assigned aircraft/forces. In summary, AFGSC/CC directs fleet-wide
     grounding/stand-downs, Wing/CCs can ground WG assigned acft or direct assigned
     forces to stand-down. If a decision is made to ground/stand-down assigned forces, notify
     AFGSC/CC/A3/A4 IAW this supplement and other applicable directives via the most
     expeditious means possible. See Fig 1.1 for Major Ops Events Considerations for items
     to accomplish/review.
        1.4.1.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Procedures for Resuming Operations: In order to
        facilitate resumption of operations and increase the free flow of information, routine
        telephone conferences are recommended, perhaps as often as daily, after grounding
        assigned aircraft. Safety related information should remain separate from topics
        discussed during this meeting in order to protect and maintain safety privilege.
        Recommended participants are representatives from the following: Affected
        unit/group/wing, NAF A3/A4, MAJCOM A3/A4, System Program Office, deployed
        locations, aircraft contractors (i.e. Boeing, Northrop Grumman, etc., as appropriate),
        and any other pertinent key organizations.
            1.4.1.2.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) When an AFGSC operational commander has
            grounded unit assigned aircraft, the HQ AFGSC/A3 has sole authority to resume
            operations.
            1.4.1.2.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) . Once the unit has determined they have the
            ability to resume operations, a request will be made to the HQ AFGSC/A3. The
            request must be written (e-mail or Defense Message Service [DMS]). The request
            will include the following: Corrective actions taken to ensure operations can
            resume safely; If operations will be resumed at a reduced rate, time line when
            operations will be back to pre-grounding levels.
            1.4.1.2.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) . HQ AFGSC/A3 will grant approval for a unit to
            resume operations via either telephone or message (DMS or e-mail). If approval
            was granted via the telephone, the HQ AFGSC/A3 will follow up with a message
            informing all agencies that were contacted during the initial grounding.
     1.4.1.3. Ensure compliance with appropriate instructions, and adequate crew preparation
     for safe conduct of flight.
     1.4.1.4. Verify aircrew member qualification before assignment to an aircrew position.
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                            13


     1.4.1.5. Notify the HARM office within 10 days of the beginning of any investigations
     that may affect an aircrew member‘s aviation service (including Flying Evaluation
     Boards).
     1.4.1.6. Notify the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent office when a rated officer with longer
     than 18 years of aviation service and assigned to an active flying position, or a CEA with
     longer than 20 years of aviation service and assigned to an active flying position, has not
     flown for 180 days and is not in suspension, disqualification, or DNIF status. Note: For
     members previously in DNIF status or assigned ASC 04, the 180-day period begins on
     the date the member was cleared to perform flying duties.
        1.4.1.6.1. (Added-AFGSC) When an incumbent assigned to an active staff flying
        position does not fly for a year, the flying justification on the AF Form 480, Aircrew
        AFSC/ Active Flying Justification, is invalidated and the MAJCOM will convert the
        position to an inactive API. If a commander requires a staff position without flight
        activity to remain active, submit a request to HQ AFGSC/A3T with justification that
        validates the continued need to keep the position active.
     1.4.1.7. Ensure aircrew members that have been disqualified for aviation service have
     the appropriate disqualification aeronautical order (AO) published, even if the member
     may have already separated or was dismissed from the Air Force. Every effort should be
     made to accomplish the disqualification action before the aircrew member is separated or
     dismissed.
     1.4.1.7. (AFGSC) In cases where the member has separated, or has been dismissed from
     the Air Force, the HARM will forward (via First Class mail) the AO or FRF to the
     address listed on the member's separation orders. If the address has changed retain the
     AO/FRF IAW the AFRIMS RDS.
     1.4.1.8. Ensure aircrew members assigned FSC S or assigned ASC 04 do not exceed 180
     days in this status without obtaining approval from the MAJCOM/A3T. If an extension is
     required, the member‘s unit commander will submit the request for an extension/waiver
     prior to the 180-day limit. If a waiver of the 180-day limit was previously approved IAW
     paragraph 1.3.4, the member‘s unit commander must again obtain waiver approval prior
     to the member exceeding 365 days in FSC S or ASC 04 status. AFI 11-402, Aviation and
     Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, provides applicable guidance for
     suspensions/disqualifications. See AFI 11-421, Aviation Resource Management, for
     additional guidance.
     1.4.1.8. (AFGSC) The HARM office will establish written procedures for processing
     extension requests. Waivers for extension will be routed through the applicable NAF/A3
     prior to requesting HQ AFGSC/A3 approval. Requests, with complete justifications, must
     be received by HQ AFGSC/A3TA NLT 10 days prior to the 180/365-day limit. Approval
     of ASC 04 beyond 180 days, but no more than 364 days, is automatic if the member is
     pending FEB actions. For these individuals, units will provide notification to HQ
     AFGSC/A3TA via a waiver request memorandum. See approved AFGSC waiver request

        1.4.1.8.1. (Added-AFGSC) The WG or OG/CC will review the aviation status of
        personnel assigned ASC "04," and FSC "S" (DNIF personnel exempted) for those
        exceeding 150 days to determine if the member should be disqualified from aviation
        service, returned to flying, assigned to a non-flying position, or requires a waiver
        from the AFGSC/A3T. In cases of personnel in active supervisory flying positions
        (API 6 and 8), determination should be made whether to keep the billets as active
        flying.
        1.4.1.8.2. (Added-AFGSC) If the OG/CC determines an aviation service waiver is
        justified, Staff waiver packages (AO, IDS, and Request letter) electronically through
        applicable                   NAF/A3                    to                  AFGSC/A3TA
        (AFGSCA3TAWorkflow@barksdale.af.mil), 160 days from the AO effective date.
        Without an approved extension, the OG/CC must initiate disqualification actions,
        return the individual to flying status, or reassign him/her to inactive status.
     1.4.1.9. Obtain OG/CC or equivalent approval for assignment of FSC K and provide the
     approval source document to the servicing HARM office for publication of the AO. The
     approval document will contain justification. Provide an information copy to the
     MAJCOM/A3.
     1.4.1.9. (AFGSC) NLT 1 Sep each year, the HARM office will notify the OG/CC (and
     AFGSC/A3TA for personnel assigned to the MAJCOM/NAF) in writing, of personnel
     assigned FSC "K". NLT 15 Sep each year the OG or WG/CC will request HQ
     AFGSC/A3 revalidation for all personnel the CC desires to extend in FSC-K. Send FSC-
     K revalidation requests (AO, IDS, Request letter), electronically to AFGSC/A3TA
     Workflow, AFGSCA3TAworkflow@ barksdale.af.mil through the appropriate NAF/A3
     to arrive NLT 15 Oct. AFGSC/A3TA will staff to AFGSC/A3.
        1.4.1.9.1. The HARM office will use the letter approving return to aviation service as
        the source document to publish an AO to assign FSC K for members returned to
        service as the result of an FEB.
        1.4.1.9.2. A member‘s commander will submit a letter or military orders to the
        servicing HARM office directing assignment of FSC K when the aircraft and/or unit
        is deactivated and the member is still assigned to an active billet pending
        reassignment. MAJCOM/A3 notification is not required.
        1.4.1.9.3. Use the Contingency Exercise Deployment (CED) orders to assign FSC K
        effective the date of the deployment when a member is assigned to an active API and
        deployed to a non-flying assignment for 90 days or more. MAJCOM/A3 notification
        is not required.
            1.4.1.9.3.1. Use the date the member returned from a non-flying deployment as
            documented by a signed DD Form 1351-2 (or suitable substitute) or commander‘s
            letter to return members to active aviation service.
        1.4.1.9.4. In all cases, the HARM office will publish the AO, with explanatory
        remarks. If required, the OG/CC will submit a revalidation request to the
        MAJCOM/A3 no later than 30 September (see paragraph 1.3.5). Upon receipt, the
        HARM office will permanently file all MAJCOM/A3 revalidation approvals on the
        left side of the member‘s FRF.

   1.4.2. Commanders, including nonflying unit commanders, manage assigned
   aircrew/parachutist members and coordinate changes affecting aircrew members flying status
   and parachutist members jump status with the HARM office. Note: This includes all Air
   Force Reserve Command Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) flyers assigned to
   active duty units at gaining MAJCOMs.
      1.4.2.1. Commanders will manage rated and CEA aircrew positions IAW AFI 11-412,
      Aircrew Management. API 5, 6, 8, B, and D coded positions may be double-billeted for
      replacement of the primary incumbent only, both members may be assigned an actively
      FAC/FSC provided the overlap is not more than 30 calendar days. On or before the 30th
      day, the commander will identify which aircrew member to assign inactive flying
      activity, FSC H. The MAJCOM/A3 may waive this paragraph to allow double-billeting
      and active flying for no longer than 180 calendar days. This waiver authority will not be
      delegated lower than the MAJCOM/A3. (EXCEPTION: Staff personnel tasked to fill a
      deployed active flying billet may be double billeted for the duration of the deployment).
      1.4.2.1. (AFGSC) The Squadron Aviation Resource Management (SARM) will
      coordinate position assignment and AO action with the HARM as necessary. SQ/CCs
      will assign personnel to a valid position within 10 working days. If the SQ/CC does not
      assign the member to a valid position within 10 working days, the HARM will assign the
      member an inactive FSC ―J.‖ Psuedo-8 positions are invalid and considered API-0 (non-
      flying) positions. Active flyers will not be assigned to a pseudo-8 billet.
      1.4.2.2. Commanders will manage non-rated & non-CEA aircrew and parachutist
      positions IAW AFI 11-402.
      1.4.2.3. Commanders will ensure aircrew/parachutist members and/or unit orderly rooms
      notify the base HARM office of all non-flying/non-parachuting/non-controlling TDYs,
      projected PCS, retirement, or separation actions. This requirement can be met by
      forwarding copies of all aircrew/parachutist members/non-controlling TDY, permanent
      change of station (PCS), retirement, or separation orders to the base HARM office to
      process required AO or ARMS actions.
          1.4.2.3.1. Commanders will ensure aircrew/parachutist members pick up their
          FRF/JRF from the HARM office prior to final outprocessing for PCS assignments.
          1.4.2.3.2. Commanders will ensure aircrew/parachutist members and/or unit orderly
          rooms notify the HARM office prior to a permanent change of assignment (PCA)
          action.
1.5. Responsibilities of Aircrew Members and Parachutists.
   1.5.1. Safely and effectively use available flying, controlling and parachute jump resources
   to obtain and maintain aircrew or parachutist qualification when assigned to active flying or
   jump billets. See AFI 11-402 for guidance pertaining to failure of members to accomplish
   aircrew or parachutist training requirements.
   1.5.2. Accomplish an annual flight or jump records review to validate aviation/parachutist
   service actions and the record of flying or jump accomplishments during the previous year.
   HARM offices may e-mail annual record review documents for a member‘s review and
   certification. The member will complete the review not later than the end of the member‘s
16                                                 AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


  birth month. Members will acknowledge the review by either sending a signed Individual
  Data Summary (IDS) to the HARM office or by providing an e-mail reply confirming the
  review was completed. File review documentation with the IDS in the FRF/JRF. (Does not
  apply to cadets who do not have FRF/JRF requirements.)
     1.5.2.1. Certification is acknowledgement by the member that the flying/jump data is
     correct. Information maintained in the FRF or JRF will not be changed without official
     source documentation. For example an AFTO Form 781 or AF Form 3520 for missing
     flights and sorties, AETC Form 240-5 for student hours, an AF Form 922 or AF Form
     4323 for missing jumps, Military ID or re-enlistment paperwork for date of separation
     change and personnel data that did not interface to ARMS, etc. In the absence of source
     documents, the member may submit a DD Form 149 to the Air Force Board for
     Corrections to Military Records (AFBCMR) IAW Air Force Pamphlet 36-2607,
     Applicant’s Guide to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR).
     HARM offices will ensure all flying hour corrections (especially to career totals) are
     supported by a source document. File a copy of the DD Form 149 in the FRF IAW AFI
     11-421. Flying hour log books and/or letters submitted under previous Air Force Policy
     will be retained in the FRF IAW AFI 11-421.
         1.5.2.1.1. AF/A3O-AT is OPR for AFBCMR requests. AF/A3O-AT may contact
         HARM offices directly to obtain documents for review/validation, to expedite
         corrective action if an AFBCMR request is received, or expedite corrective action to
         ARMS data received on the Consolidated Headquarters Aviation Resource
         Management System (CHARM) report (see AFI 11-421).
     1.5.2.2. Inactive aircrew/jump personnel will accomplish a records review within 120
     days prior to PCS. They are not required to accomplish annual reviews of their FRF/JRF.
     1.5.2.3. Aircrew/jump personnel suspended or disqualified for aviation service will
     accomplish a FRF/JRF review within 30 days of the suspension or disqualification action.
     Geographically separated members will acknowledge the review by either sending a
     signed IDS to the HARM office or by providing an e-mail reply confirming the review
     was completed.
  1.5.3. Ensure the HARM office maintaining the FRF or JRF is aware of a pending PCS. The
  HARM office must be advised of the proposed departure date, date of last flight or jump
  before departure, and date the individual will pick up the FRF or JRF. Member must notify
  the HARM office at least five days prior to departure, if applicable. Geographically separated
  members may send a written notification to the attached HARM office to mail their FRF/JRF
  to the gaining base. Validate flights accomplished before departing PCS and sign ARMS
  generated PCS products IAW AFI 11-421.
  1.5.3. (AFGSC) Locally assigned aircrew members are required to hand carry their Flight
  Record Folders (FRF)/Jump Record Folder (JRF) to their next duty location. Aircrew
  members PCSing to a geographically separated location will physically out-process from the
  HARM office, but the HARM will mail the records to the gaining location. Individuals
  PCSing from geographically separated units will fax/scan one copy of PCS orders to the
  losing HARM. Once received, the HARM will send a copy of the out-processing checklist to
  the individual for completion. The individual will fax/scan the out-processing checklist back
  to the HARM, who will then mail the records to the gaining location.
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                             17


  1.5.4. Pick up the Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) and FRF or JRF before departing for PCS
  or flying/jumping TDY IAW AFI 11-421. Members initiating parachutist status, scheduled to
  attend jump school, must give the HARM office a copy of their TDY orders at least 5 work-
  days prior to TDY, to allow processing of the initial AO authorizing jump status.
  1.5.5. Turn in the FRF or JRF to the proper HARM office (or notify the HARM office that
  the record was mailed) within 10 duty-days after arriving at a new duty station (includes
  flying TDY). Inactive aircrew members and parachutists must also turn in the FRF, JRF, and
  FEF within 10 duty days. If a member does not turn in the FRF or JRF within the 10 day
  limit, the HARM office will suspend aviation career incentive pay (ACIP), career enlisted
  flyer incentive pay (CEFIP), hazardous duty incentive pay (HDIP), and static or high altitude
  low opening (HALO) jump incentive pay by assigning ASC 04 via AO. Upon receipt of the
  member‘s FRF/JRF, the HARM office will revoke the suspension and restore incentive pay,
  if otherwise qualified. HARM offices will consider mailed records as ―turned in‖ and will not
  suspend incentive pay for these members. HARM offices will make every effort to contact
  the member prior to stopping incentive pay. HARM offices will ensure FRFs/JRFs are
  inprocessed to the ARMS database NLT 10 calendar days after receipt of the records. Note:
  The losing HARM office will mail the FRF to the gaining HARM office if the member‘s
  next duty location HARM office is not collocated within the gaining HARM office.
  1.5.5. (AFGSC) HARM offices will establish written procedures in a memorandum of
  agreement with the military personnel flight (MPF) to ensure flying/jump personnel (active
  and inactive) are identified and informed of the responsibility to deliver the FRF/JRF to the
  HARM office.
     1.5.5.1. Aircrew members and parachutists assigned to an inactive API code/duty
     position (after an active flying assignment – PCA or PCS) will turn in their FEF to the
     HARM office within five duty days of assignment to an inactive API code/flying position
     (i.e. API-6 flyer is placed in an API-3 position). The HARM office will file the FEF
     inside the member‘s FRF. If the member returns to active flying status, the HARM office
     will contact the member to pick up the FEF or forward the FEF to the member‘s flying
     unit. (If the FEF is forwarded, the HARM office will retain a copy of the contents until
     receipt is acknowledged by the gaining unit.)
  1.5.6. Turn in medical records to the Flight Medicine Element (FME) within 10 duty-days
  after arriving at new duty station and complete initial medical clearance requirements prior to
  first flight or jump.
     1.5.6.1. Initial medical clearance requirements also apply to members who deploy for
     365 days or longer in TDY or PCS status.
  1.5.7. Complete flight physicals and Preventive Health Assessment (PHA) IAW AFI 48-123,
  Medical Examinations and Standards and AFI 44-170, Preventive Health Assessment.
  1.5.8. Members will sign out their AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record
  (original), and AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational
  Duty (copy) from the HARM office prior to attending physiological/centrifuge training.
  Upon completion of training, return forms to the HARM office within 5 duty days after
  arrival at home station.

   1.5.8. (AFGSC) Members placed on Duty Not Involving Flying (DNIF) status are
   prohibited from attending physiological and centrifuge training, unless a valid AF Form
   1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty, verifying eligibility
   to accomplish training, is received from the FME.
   1.5.9. Inactive aircrew members will notify the HARM office not later than 10 duty days
   prior to departing on an authorized flying TDY (includes requalification courses).
   1.5.10. Request attachment for flying according to paragraph 2.16 when assigned to an
   active flying billet in a unit without flying facilities or aircraft.
   1.5.11. When aircrew members depart PCS or PCA, ensure sign-out from unit/base does not
   negatively affect Operational Flying Duty Accumulation (OFDA) credit. Aircrew members
   require at least 15 days on active flying status in a month to receive OFDA credit for that
   month. See paragraph 2.5 for additional guidance pertaining to operational flying duty.
       1.5.11.1. Aircrew members assigned to an active flying billet who are being reassigned
       to an inactive billet should make every effort to outprocess from their unit/base after the
       15th of the month to provide an opportunity to obtain the last month of OFDA credit (if
       flight requirements are also met).
       1.5.11.2. Aircrew members assigned to an inactive billet who are being reassigned to an
       active billet should outprocess from their unit/base before the 15th of the month to
       provide an opportunity to obtain OFDA credit for the first month of assignment in an
       active billet (if flight requirements are also met).
1.6. Flying Obligations.
   1.6.1. During Time of War. Commanders (including unit commanders) may order Air
   Force members on active duty to make flights in any aircraft. Members are not entitled to
   incentive pay unless placed on active AOs that require them to perform specific in-flight
   duties on a frequent and regular basis as defined in this instruction. Members are not entitled
   to such pay if the pay is suspended by the President according to Title 37 United States Code
   (USC). Members are entitled to flight credit IAW paragraph 3.2
       1.6.1.1. Members qualified on the aircraft in which they are tasked to perform in-flight
       duties log the appropriate aircrew certification code IAW Table A2.3 and flying hours
       associated with duties performed IAW Section 3A of this instruction.
       1.6.1.2. Members not qualified on the aircraft in which they are tasked to perform in-
       flight duties log ―O‖ or ―X‖ aircrew certification code (first character) and other time
       IAW paragraph 3.3.5
   1.6.2. In Time of Peace. Commanders (including unit commanders) may order Air Force
   members on active duty to make official flights when in the best interest of the Air Force.
   Aircrew members on active flying status AOs will receive incentive pay if otherwise
   qualified and flight requirements are met (does not apply to non-interference fliers on AOs).
   Rated officers and CEAs will receive OFDA credit if otherwise qualified.
       1.6.2.1. Military and civil service (GS) aircrew members who are properly qualified,
       meet the criteria of this instruction and AFI 11-402 for initiating aviation service, and are
       directed to perform specific inflight duties on a frequent and regular basis will be placed
       on AOs and a flight authorization.
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                               19


        1.6.2.1.1. An aircrew member not obtaining or maintaining qualification in a specific
        aircraft will be placed on the flight authorization for that aircraft only when his or her
        presence is required for accomplishment of the mission. (See also paragraph 1.8.1)
        These members will log time IAW paragraph 3.2 of this instruction.
        1.6.2.1.2. Aircrew members in a specialty not listed in an AFI 65-503, US Air Force
        Cost and Planning Factors, crew complement, who are not obtaining or maintaining
        aircraft qualification, may be authorized to fly IAW paragraph 1.8 and log flying
        times IAW paragraph 3.2 of this instruction when required for the mission.
     1.6.2.2. Non-aircrew members who are properly qualified and directed to perform
     specific inflight non-interference duties will be placed on AOs and the flight
     authorization but will not be placed on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission
     Flight Data Document. Refer to paragraph 2.10.4 for additional guidance. EXCEPTION:
     Non-aircrew members assigned to flying unit commander positions or remotely piloted
     aircraft (RPA) sensor operator positions (1N1XX) may log flying time in assigned
     aircraft IAW paragraphs 3.2.1.5.2 and 3.2.1.5.3
     1.6.2.3. Military members not on AOs, and not required to perform duties or obtain and
     maintain qualification in the aircraft, must fly in passenger status. These members will
     be placed on a passenger manifest, and must fly on commercial or military aircraft with
     adequate facilities for transporting passengers. Refer to paragraphs 1.8.3, 1.9.4.7., 2.10.5.,
     and applicable MDS-Specific guidance for further passenger guidance/restrictions.
     1.6.2.4. Commanders, including unit commanders, may detail by written orders
     personnel under their command to take part in aircraft flights operated by any foreign
     government accredited by the United States, provided the flights do not add additional
     expense to the US Government, and provided personnel are on AOs authorizing frequent
     and regular flights. See paragraph 1.11 for additional guidance.
     1.6.2.5. Personnel who are required for the execution of the aircraft or unit mission and
     personnel not authorized AOs (as specified above) tasked to perform unique ground
     support duties at an enroute location or destination point that are directly related and
     essential to accomplishment of the aircraft or unit mission may fly as Mission Essential
     Personnel (MEP). MAJCOMs may further define MEP in MAJCOM supplements to this
     instruction, but guidance may not be less restrictive than the guidance contained herein.
     See paragraph 1.12.2.2 for additional guidance, and Attachment 1, Terms, for MEP
     definition.
        1.6.2.5.1. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the mission being
        flown authorizes MEP status. If operational control transfers, the OG/CC (or
        equivalent) who assumes follow-on operational control may continue/revise MEP
        status (coordinate changes with originating OG/CC). MAJCOMs may establish intra-
        command and inter-command guidance to facilitate this process. MEP may only fly
        on aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R, Air
        Transportation Eligibility. EXCEPTIONS: MEP who are mission essential may fly
        on aircraft not normally equipped for carrying passengers. MEP who fly under the
        provisions of this exception must be physically and physiologically (when required)
        qualified and must complete applicable egress training prior to flight.

     1.6.2.5.1. (AFGSC) Approval Authority. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with
     operational control of the aircraft being flown approves Mission Essential Personnel
     (MEP) status on a case-by-case basis (each flight or mission). Non-USAF uniformed
     service members and civilian members of other U.S. federal agencies may be
     approved for MEP status on passenger capable aircraft when supporting AFGSC
     missions (e.g. simulated survivors for CSAR exercises with en-route ground-based
     duties).
     1.6.2.5.2. (Added-AFGSC) Do not approve MEP status:
        1.6.2.5.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) To allow members to perform in-flight duties.
        MEP are a category of passenger while the aircraft is airborne. MEP duties are
        performed on the ground, en-route, or at point of destination.
        1.6.2.5.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) When         the   purpose    is   to   provide    an
        orientation/familiarization flight.
        1.6.2.5.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) To provide opportunity solely for the purpose of
        transiting Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE) or Hostile Fire/Imminent Danger
        Pay zones.
        1.6.2.5.2.4. (Added-AFGSC) To allow members to travel while on leave.
     1.6.2.5.3. (Added-AFGSC) Procedures. Forward requests to reach the approval
     authority NLT 10 duty days prior to the expected date of departure. Include name,
     rank, organization, purpose for MEP status, proposed itinerary, and dates.
     1.6.2.5.4. (Added-AFGSC) Travel Orders. Cite MEP approval on the DD Form
     1610, Request and Authorization for TDY Travel of DOD Personnel, or equivalent, or
     in a memorandum signed by the appropriate authority and hand-carried by the
     individual. Forward a copy to the SARM office, who will maintain this document
     with the flight authorization corresponding to the mission.
        1.6.2.5.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) The following is an example statement for MEP
        travel orders: ―MEP status is authorized by (appropriate OG/CC) on (aircraft
        number or mission number/exercise or contingency name) for (duration, i.e. 22-27
        June 2005).‖
     1.6.2.5.5. (Added-AFGSC) MEP travel in passenger status and will be listed on a
     DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest, or on the remarks section of the flight
     authorization. If the number of MEP exceeds four per aircraft, the appropriate
     AFGSC command and control agency (other than aircrew) will ensure passenger
     manifesting and anti-hijacking procedures are accomplished prior to MEP reporting
     to the aircraft.
     1.6.2.5.6. (Added-AFGSC) Aircrew Procedures. With aircraft commander
     approval, and seats permitting, MEP may be seated on the flight deck/crew
     compartment during takeoff and landing. Simulated emergencies, to include no-flap
     landings, are prohibited when an MEP is present on the flight deck. Touch-and-go
     landings are authorized.

      1.6.2.6. MAJCOMs may designate aircrew members who travel as additional
      crewmembers (not required for the mission being flown but required for follow-on
      missions) as MEP. Approval authority may be delegated below MAJCOM level.
      1.6.2.6. (AFGSC) Additional crew members are aircrew members on active
      Aeronautical Orders (AOs) not required for the mission being flown, but who are
      required to travel to or from a TDY location to perform flight duties in support of
      AFGSC operations. Aircrew members in this situation now fall under MEP status and
      may have a higher priority over other members traveling in MEP status on AFGSC
      aircraft.
          1.6.2.6.1. For AMC missions already in the system, the TACC Senior Controller may
          approve MEP status. For other MAJCOM missions in the system, MAJCOMs may
          designate (in MAJCOM supplements) individuals who may approve MEP status for
          members assigned to the command. Approval authority will be retained at the
          MAJCOM level unless the MAJCOM functional authority is exercised from a
          subordinate NAF, in which case the NAF may exercise approval authority.
          MAJCOM Standardization/ Evaluation Chiefs may approve MEP status for
          MAJCOM or MAJCOM-gained missions for evaluators assigned to the MAJCOM.
          Additional crewmembers who fly in MEP status may only fly on aircraft capable of
          carrying passengers IAW provisions of DoD 4515.13-R.
          1.6.2.6.1. (AFGSC) Unit commanders submit aircrew MEP requests for personnel
          assigned or attached to their unit to the OG/CC, with justification why the member
          needs to travel in aircrew MEP status in lieu of normal passenger status. Once
          granted, TDY order remarks should reflect OG/CC approval to travel as aircrew MEP
          on aircraft under their control or the member should carry a copy of the aircrew MEP
          approval letter with them. Aircrew MEP status will not be granted for familiarization
          flights or for personnel while on leave.
          1.6.2.6.2. (Added-AFGSC) Units with individuals who travel frequently in MEP
          status, including but not limited to security forces personnel traveling on unit
          assigned aircraft performing convoy duty, may provide a master MEP certification
          letter approved by the OG/CC. Whenever individual information on the letter
          changes, the entire letter must be updated, however, the OG/CC certification is only
          required once every three months.
          1.6.2.6.3. (Added-AFGSC) Members wanting to travel in aircrew MEP status on
          aircraft outside their OG/CC‘s control will coordinate with the OG/CC (or equivalent)
          controlling that aircraft/mission. Members use their TDY orders (with aircrew MEP
          in the remarks) or approval letter to show their aircrew member/travel status.
1.7. Waivers.
   1.7.1. For Combat Missions or National Emergencies. MAJCOM commanders may waive
   any requirements of this instruction when necessary to carry out combat missions or to
   accomplish missions flown during a state of national emergency. Provide notification to
   AF/A3/5 with a copy to AF/A3O-AT.
   1.7.2. At Other Times. Unless otherwise specified in this instruction, AF/A3O-A is the
   waiver authority for this instruction. Request waivers through applicable channels to the
 22                                                AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


   MAJCOM/A3, or equivalent level. MAJCOM/A3s (or equivalents) will forward requests to
   AF/A3O-A, with a courtesy copy to AF/A3O-AT. Waiver authority for supplemental
   guidance will be as specified in the supplement and approved through the higher level
   coordination authority.
   1.7.2. (AFGSC) Waiver authority for this supplement is AFGSC/A3.
   1.7.3. Administrative Procedures. MAJCOMs may publish HQ USAF waivers in
   supplements citing the authority (e.g., HQ USAF/A3O-A memo, date, subject). See AFI 33-
   360 for additional guidance on waivers to publications.
   1.7.4. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC Waivers. HQ AFGSC/A3 is the waiver authority for
   this supplement. Send proposed waivers through WG/CC to NAF/A3 to HQ AFGSC/A3TA.

Section 1B—Flight Authorization

1.8. Aircraft Flight Authorizations.
   1.8.1. Prior to all flights in Air Force aircraft, commanders (including unit commanders)
   issue written authorizations documenting all personnel required to perform inflight duties on
   the mission. Units will use AF Form 4327, ARMS Fighter Flight Authorization, or AF Form
   4327a, Crew Flight Authorization, as applicable to the unit aircraft. A commander's
   (including unit commanders) verbal authorization may direct aircraft flight only when time
   constraints or administrative procedures prevent written authorization. Written confirmation
   of this order must be issued within three duty-days. Once a Flight Authorization (FA) has
   been signed, changes to aircrew names and/or duty positions must be validated by a
   designated approving authority by placing the approving authority's initials by the line
   changed. The OG/CC or equivalent commander with operational control of the mission is
   responsible for the publication/ maintenance/retention of the aircraft FAs for each mission
   flown by the aircraft. Only commissioned officers and officer equivalent government
   civilians in active flying positions are authorized to be authenticating officials for Flight
   Authorizations. FA authenticating officials will be appointed in writing by the OG/CC or
   equivalent commander. EXCEPTION 1: Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), Pararescue (PJ), and
   ANG Senior Scout unit commanders and properly designated authenticating officials may
   publish a FA for assigned aircrew members required to perform aircrew duties on the
   mission. Commanders or designated authenticating officials must ensure all members listed
   meet go/no-go criteria prior to authenticating the FA. The FA is not a stand-alone document
   and must be attached to the aircraft FA for the mission on which aircrew members were
   required to perform in-flight duties. If the AE or PJ crew is scheduled to perform aircrew
   duties on more than one mission, a remark will be placed on the FA to depict variations. As a
   minimum, the information in blocks 11 through 18 must be documented on the flight
   authorization. In the Remarks section of the aircraft FA, annotate the AE/pararescue FA
   number, date, and unit designation. The FA is a critical document used to validate aircrew
   member‗s duties/flight time logged on the AFTO Form 781. Officers or officer equivalent
   government civilians will be designated as FA authenticating officials in writing by the
   OG/CC or equivalent commander. Members properly designated as FA authenticating
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                             23


  officials IAW this paragraph are not required to be assigned to an active flying position to
  perform FA authentication duties. EXCEPTION 2: RPA units will complete a preflight
  authorization signed by the aircraft commander to confirm go/no-go checks were completed.
  The authenticating official will issue a verbal order for the mission. The FA will be published
  upon termination of the mission and include crew members who flew on the mission, verbal
  order acknowledged in the remark section, and AC block initialed by the duty scheduler.
  1.8.1. (AFGSC) Units will use the AF Form 4327, ARMS Fighter Flight Authorization or
  the AF Form 4327a, ARMS Multi-Crew Flight Authorization, to document all flights.
  Electronic versions may be used, but modifications to these forms are not authorized. Each
  flight authorization generated by an automated scheduling system will mirror the
  corresponding AF Form. Flights with a planned destination other than the point of departure
  (cross country, etc.) will be documented on AF Form 4327a. A single AF Form 4327a may
  be used for a multi-day itinerary only when all other data (except date) remains the same.
  When significant changes to crew members, mission symbols, mission numbers, etc. are
  required, generate a new flight authorization. Number all flight authorizations consecutively
  starting each fiscal year, and record the numbers in a flight authorization log. Maintain these
  forms according to the AFRDS in AFRIMS. Flight authorization approval authorities will be
  designated in writing by the OG/CC and should be limited to the flying unit CC/DO/ADO.
  The OG/CC may grant exceptions to a limited number of additional rated officers on a case
  by case basis. Minor changes to the original flight authorization such as tail number swaps,
  will be initialed by one of the designated approval authorities. When TDY orders directing
  individuals to perform specific crew duties are attached to and filed with the flight
  authorization, they are considered a part of the flight authorization.
     1.8.1.1. Units will validate go/no-go qualification IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew
     Standardization/Evaluation Program, prior to authorizing members to participate in
     aircrew or operational support duties. Once a FA has been published, the pilot in
     command, or FA authenticating official if the pilot in command is not available, will
     validate go/no-go status for additional aircrew or operational support members prior to
     authorizing them to fly and adding or attaching them to the FA. Validation may include
     ARMS products IAW AFI 11-421 (or comparable database for USAFA airmanship
     programs), a FA from an AE, Pararescue, or Senior Scout unit commander (or designated
     representative), or a letter from the member‘s unit validating the individual‗s
     qualification to fly on required missions. Note: When preparing flight authorizations for
     missions scheduled on future dates, the aviation resource management specialist or
     designated representative responsible for go/no-go validation will confirm the member‘s
     AO status and ensure currency (to include flight physical and physiological training) and
     qualification will remain valid through the scheduled flight date(s). The FA is an official
     document depicting what actually occurred on the mission. The original, printed, signed
     forms with changes annotated are required documentation. Reproduction and disposal of
     the original forms to remove pen/ink changes after the flight authenticating official has
     signed the form and sorties/missions have occurred is not authorized.
     1.8.1.1. (AFGSC) Non-1C0X2 personnel validating go/no-go qualification will be
     designated in writing by the unit commander. Training will be documented on AF Form
     623 or equivalent.
  1.8.2. The flight authorization must include (minimum requirements):
 24                                                  AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


      1.8.2.1. A designated pilot-in-command, and formation flight leader of each flight or
      flight element.
      1.8.2.2. Name, grade, and flight authorization duty code (Table A2.3) of each
      crewmember, operational support flier, or any other official personnel (use the position
      designation established by the MAJCOM) required for the mission or flight.
      1.8.2.3. Type, serial number, mission symbol, and call sign of aircraft or formation.
      1.8.2.4. Place from which the flight will depart plus ―on-or-about‖ departure date.
      1.8.2.5. An itinerary and the phrase ―Variations in itinerary authorized.‖
      1.8.2.6. (Added-AFGSC) Authorized Remark Codes (AF Form 4327 or 4327a) are
      contained in Attachment 4 of this supplement.
   1.8.3. Flight authorizations will only include personnel on AOs (or contract aircrew
   personnel on a memorandum of agreement/contract) authorized to perform in-flight duties
   for that mission according to paragraphs 1.10 and 3.2 of this instruction. Except for MEP and
   non-interference members, individuals on the flight authorization should match those
   authorized to log time on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract.
      1.8.3.1. Personnel who are on the aircraft for point-to-point travel, an
      orientation/familiarization flight or to only perform a proficiency jump (not performing
      aircrew duties for that mission) will be listed on the passenger manifest. Passenger
      manifesting is required on all DoD owned and controlled aircraft, IAW DoD 4500.09-E,
      Transportation and Traffic Management.
      1.8.3.2. If MEP are transported, IAW MAJCOM supplements, they may be listed on the
      flight authorization in the Remarks section only. If MEP are listed on the flight
      authorization, the Remarks section will include all information required by DD Form
      2131, Passenger Manifest, to include emergency contact information. If MEP are not
      listed on the flight authorization, they must be placed on the passenger manifest. MEP
      will not be listed on the AFTO Form 781, will not log time, and will not accrue OFDA
      credit.
   1.8.4. If a mission is cancelled after the FA is signed, line through the canceled portion(s) of
   the flight authorization and annotate the reason for cancellation (e.g. weather or maintenance
   cancel).
   1.8.5. MAJCOMs will establish procedures to ensure compliance with the guidance in this
   section for alert sorties.
1.9. Authorization for Using US Air Force Aircraft.
   1.9.1. Commanders (including unit commanders) authorize aircraft flights to support
   command operations.
   1.9.2. Commanders (including unit commanders) will ensure each flight is in the direct
   interest of government business and does not exceed flying hour allocations without specific
   approval. Commanders (including unit commanders) will not authorize flights for personal
   convenience or recreation.
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                             25


  1.9.2. (AFGSC) Flying hour allocations are IAW AFI 11-102, Flying Hour Program
  Management.
  1.9.3. The transportation of passengers and cargo will be in accordance with DoD 4515.13-
  R. The Deputy Chief of Staff/Logistics, Installations & Mission Support (HQ USAF/A4/7),
  develops and publishes passenger policy to oversee passenger movement. AFI 24-101,
  Passenger Movement, provides guidance and procedures for arranging official transportation
  of Air Force personnel.
  1.9.4. Commanders (including unit commanders) may use Air Force aircraft under their
  control to:
     1.9.4.1. Perform tactical and combat operations.
     1.9.4.2. Train aircrew personnel and evaluate aircrew performance.
     1.9.4.3. Allow aircrews to meet the flying requirements of this instruction.
     1.9.4.4. Further national health or safety interests, to include saving of human life if a
     medical officer indicates the situation involves possible loss of life, limb, or sight (DoD
     4515.13-R).
     1.9.4.5. Cooperate with foreign governments as directed by HQ USAF.
     1.9.4.6. Perform other official missions as required.
         1.9.4.6.1. (Added-AFGSC) Units will ensure all search and rescue (SAR) as well as
         disaster relief missions are coordinated through the Air Force Rescue Coordination
         Center (AFRCC), Tyndall AFB. FL. If time constraints preclude contacting the
         AFRCC, local commanders may use their resources to support appropriate
         SAR/transportation requests IAW DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 10.
     1.9.4.7. Conduct the Air Force Orientation Flight and Public Affairs Travel programs
     according to DoD 4515.13-R; AFI 11-301, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program;
     AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program; AFI 35-103, Public Affairs
     Travel; AFI 35-105, Community Relations; AFI 48-123, this instruction, and MAJCOM
     guidelines.
         1.9.4.7.1. Orientation Flights. The USAF conducts orientation flights to reward and
         motivate individuals (incentive orientation flights only), ensure a better understanding
         of a particular weapon system and its role, or when the flight is determined to be in
         the best interest of the USAF. Orientation flights may be approved as provided in
         DoD 4515.13-R and this instruction. No authority exists for approval of an orientation
         flight during which a record attempt is made, a first flight is made on an aircraft just
         accepted into the inventory, a first flight over an isolated geographical area, or any
         other flight of a similar or special nature, where abnormal conditions may exist.
         Table 1.1 is a matrix of approval authorities for orientation flights.
         1.9.4.7.1. (AFGSC) See Attachment 5 (Added) AFGSC ORIENTATION FLIGHT
         PROGRAM.
            1.9.4.7.1.1. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Flights. Display USAF weapons systems

        aircraft and mission to enhance their understanding of the military member‘s role
        and contribution to the Air Force mission. Spouse orientation flights will be
        limited to retention and recruitment of critical skills and will not be expanded to
        an all-skills, service-wide program. Spouse orientation flights will adhere to the
        following guidance:
        1.9.4.7.1.4. (AFGSC) Aircrew training will not be conducted during spouse
        orientation flights. Orientation flights for wing/OG key staff spouses will only be
        in conjunction with spouse orientation flights. Only spouses of active duty,
        reserve, and federalized guardsman personnel are authorized to participate. An
        escort must accompany spouses at all times.

            attitudes, touch-and-go landings, minimum altitude, terrain following profiles,
            airdrop missions, and other maneuvers/profiles listed in MDS-specific
            publications as prohibited with passengers on board.
            1.9.4.7.1.4.4. Ensure a qualified pilot or copilot occupies the seat throughout
            the flight. Under no circumstances will a spouse be given control of the
            aircraft. The pilot in command will brief this restriction prior to each mission.
            1.9.4.7.1.4.5. Units with fighter, bomber, and two-seat trainer aircraft may
            establish an aircraft spouse taxi-ride program.
        1.9.4.7.1.5. Passengers on orientation flights must be in appropriate
        organizational uniform, where applicable, and present appropriate identification.
        1.9.4.7.1.6. (Added-AFGSC) Mission profile and aircraft maneuvers are
        restricted by the basic AFI, this supplement, and MDS-specific guidance for
        carrying passengers. For additional AFGSC Orientation Flight Guidelines see
        Attachment 5 (Added).
     1.9.4.7.2. Public Affairs Flights. The Air Force conducts public affairs flights for

 This table provides approval authority guidance for orientation flights (as defined in DoD
 4515.13-R, Chapter 4) only. Guidance for Public Affairs flights (ref. DoD 4515.13-R,
 Chapter 3) is provided in the DoD regulation and in AFI 35-103.
NOTES:
1. ―Orientation flights‖ are defined as continuous flights performed within the local flying area
and terminating at the point of origin (DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 4). ―Note 1 N/A,‖ means the
category of flight may not be considered an orientation flight; however, it is included in the table
as a consolidated reference source.
        1a. EXCEPTION: Units may accomplish orientation flights within the local flying area
to operational and remote sites that are part of the home unit, as long as the mission terminates at
the point of origin. Such flights providing unit mission orientation are not considered point-to-
point flights and an exception to policy is not required (OSD-ATL policy guidance, Feb 10).
2. Requests for point-to-point travel must be specifically addressed and approved by SECAF.
Retiring members of Congress and retiring congressional staff members may be flown on
orientation flights only upon the written approval of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Legislative Affairs (ASD[LA]). (Ref. DSD Memo, 23 Dec 1996.) For Line 1, initiate action
through SAF/LLO (SAF/LLO Workflow in the Global Address List).
3. When aircraft are ―chopped‖ or assigned to a gaining Combatant Commander, approval
authority will be the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) or Theater Special Operations
Command (SOC) commander.
4. Inform AF/CC, AF/A3/5, AF/A3O, AF/A3O-A, if approved.                  (Provide notification to
respective Workflows in the Global Address List.)
5. Flights involving foreign nationals must be reviewed for foreign disclosure requirements and
political concerns. Foreign government officials are equivalent to U.S. Federal government
officials and do not include local government officials such as mayors, police chiefs, and other
local officials who do not represent a foreign government at the national level. Foreign military
―civilian equivalents‖ are comparable to DoD ―civilian equivalents.‖
a. Ensure foreign disclosure requirements and base visit requests are satisfied according to AFI
16-201, Air Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program. Contact MAJCOM
or COCOM Foreign Disclosure Officer (FDO) for assistance.
b. Coordinate with the country director in the appropriate SAF/IA regional division (four-letter
level), before approval, to ensure no political concerns exist that would prevent the flight.
Contact SAF/IAR(_) on the Global address list at saf.iar_@pentagon.af.mil (blank space is for
SAF/IA Regional Division: A for AFRICOM, C for CENTCOM, E for EUCOM, L for
NORTHCOM/SOUTHCOM, P for PACOM).
6. This authorization does not include transportation to or from the exercise area or supporting
flights utilized for logistics purposes only.
7. Does not include spouses of government personnel, non-DoD Federal officials, or members of
Congress and their staffs.
8. For foreign students enrolled in USAF Academy or ROTC programs, ensure foreign
disclosure requirements (AFI 16-201) concerning visit authorizations and disclosure of USAF
 30                                                  AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


information are satisfied.
9. This is not intended to allow all Government contractor employees to fly. The contractors
must be performing work in direct support of the approving command (aircrew training system
and aircraft maintenance contractors are the most frequent participants). Normally, the
requirement for familiarization flights should be specified in the government contract.
10. Foreign citizens are not included in DoD 4515.13-R as passengers eligible for orientation
flights.
11. For youth in Congressionally sanctioned, DoD-approved Youth Programs, program
participants may take part in no more than one orientation flight (Ref DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter
4). Parental and/or guardian permission is required and the flight must be approved by SAF/PA.
Specific Public Law guidance applies, including Title 10 United States Code (USC), Section
2012, and Title 32 USC, Section 508.
12. Passengers on orientation flights under 18 years of age require parental approval in writing.
13. Requests for exception to policy must be submitted through command channels according to
DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 10, and AFI 24-101. Note: Exception to policy authority delegated
from AF/CC to AF/CV IAW AFI 24-101. Send exception to policy requests to AF/A3/5 with an
info copy to AF/A3O-AT.
14. Cadets and midshipmen are authorized orientation flights while on leave status.
15. Aircrew members in suspended (ASC 04) or DNIF status are not authorized familiarization/
orientation or incentive flights without an approved waiver from AF/A3O-AT.

 NOTES: Attachment 5 (Added) AFGSC ORIENTATION FLIGHT PROGRAM of this supplement
 must also be thoroughly reviewed for additional guidance and restrictions beyond those listed in table
 1.1 above, and the notes below:
5. SAF/IAD or the host unit Foreign Disclosure Officer (if assigned) will provide disclosure guidance
for the flight by separate message. Ensure aircrews review this disclosure guidance prior to the
briefing and flight. Host units will ensure disclosure guidance and the rationale for it will not be
discussed with foreign nationals or their representatives.

16. (Added). AFGSC units out-of-CONUS or deploying to out-of-CONUS areas (not CHOPed)
desiring to offer orientation flights to foreign nationals, must first obtain AFGSC/CV coordination
and theater commander concurrence before the flight is offered to the foreign national. This must
occur prior to seeking formal approval for the flight regardless of the approval authority.

17. (Added). B-2 orientation flights for all General Officer ranks (1 through 4 star) must be
approved by AFGSC/A3. Submit approval requests to AFGSC/A3TA for processing. For O-6 and
below, WG/CC may approve, but must inform AFGSC/A3 (email notification will suffice with an
info cy to AFGSC A3T Workflow and AFGSC A3TA/Workflow) prior to flight.

18. (Added). For AFGSC Bomber aircraft taxi-ride program see A5.2.1.4. (Added) of this
supplement.
1.10. Authorization to Perform Inflight Duties in Air Force Aircraft.
   1.10.1. To perform inflight or parachutist duties, members must be specifically authorized
   and required for the mission, physically qualified, and current in physiological training when
   required IAW AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program. (Note: See AFI 11-
   202V1 for guidance regarding physiological training requirements if member will be
   removed from flying status within four months following the expiration date of physiological
   training currency.) Unit commanders will restrict individuals from performing inflight duties
   in the unit assigned aircraft when such performance may adversely impact safety, morale, or
   mission accomplishment. Commanders (including unit commanders) may authorize the
   following personnel to perform aircrew duties (as part of the authorized crew complement
   IAW AFI 65-503, or required for the mission, IAW paragraph 3.2.1.5 of this instruction) and
   operational support duties (IAW AFI 11-402) on board or supporting Air Force aircraft:
NOTES:
1. For guidance applicable to parachutist members performing duties in Air Force aircraft, see
AFI 11-410.
2. An aircrew member, non-interference RPA sensor operator (1N1XX), or parachutist in DNIF
status will not perform inflight aircrew or parachutist duties.
3. If not otherwise restricted by AF Form 1042 or MAJCOM guidance, aircrew members in
DNIF status may perform aircrew duties in the simulator for which they are qualified.
   1.10.1. (AFGSC) The SARM will verify aircrew currency/proficiency during the
   scheduling process and again prior to the crew member stepping to fly. The SARM will
   ensure the following items are current and active for each flyer: active and current
   aeronautical order, current physical, initial base clearance as applicable (physical), current
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                           33


  physiological training, centrifuge training (if required); all AFI 11-2MDS specific grounding
  currencies, and member‘s scheduled crew position is listed in AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost
  and Planning Factors, or member is required for the mission as documented by flying
  unit/CC.
     1.10.1.1. Qualified members of US military services who hold a current aeronautical
     rating or aviation badge, are on active AOs to take part in frequent and regular flights,
     and are within the authorized crew complement (AFI 65-503) for the aircraft or are
     required for the mission.
         1.10.1.1.1. Aircrew members will perform duty associated with their current
         aeronautical rating and aircrew qualification, unless ordered to perform mission-
         essential rated duties outside their normal aircrew specialty in direct support of
         MAJCOM (or equivalent) -approved operations. Flying solely for the purpose of
         qualifying for incentive pay or OFDA credit is not authorized.
         1.10.1.1.2. When members are ordered to perform rated duties outside their current
         aeronautical rating and aircrew qualification, commanders will ensure members are
         trained and qualified to perform other rated duties. Commanders will provide a
         memorandum to the member‘s servicing HARM office with justification for the
         action. HARM personnel will file this memorandum permanently in the member‘s
         FRF and change the member‘s crew position to Y in ARMS (see also Table A2.3).
         See AFI 11-421 for specific HARM actions.
     1.10.1.2. Qualified non-rated officers and enlisted personnel of US military services on
     AOs, who are required to perform mission essential inflight duties on a full time basis,
     and are within the authorized crew complement (AFI 65-503) for the aircraft or are
     required for the mission.
     1.10.1.2. (AFGSC) Supervisors must ensure that the number of non-rated crew
     members on active status is the minimum necessary to complete the unit's mission and
     does not exceed authorized aircrew manning positions (―X‖ prefix) UMD billets. When
     these personnel are no longer required to fly to accomplish the unit's mission, their
     aeronautical orders will be terminated IAW AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist
     Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges.
         1.10.1.2.1. Aircrew members will perform duty associated with their current aircrew
         specialty and aircrew qualification. Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for
         incentive pay or OFDA credit is not authorized.
     1.10.1.3. Operational support fliers on AOs and required to perform specific inflight
     duties on an occasional basis that cannot be accomplished by regularly assigned crew
     members, and other non-rated/non-CEA members on non-interference AOs (paragraphs
     2.10.3 and 2.10.4) who fly occasionally to perform specific official inflight tasks.
         1.10.1.3.1. Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for Hazardous Duty Incentive
         Pay is not authorized.
     1.10.1.4. Personnel authorized by competent authority to receive instruction in aircrew
     duties at Air Force schools.

       1.10.2.2. Paragraph 1.10.2 does not preclude additional family members from traveling
       aboard an aircraft in a non aircrew-duty status, when such members are otherwise eligible
       for air transportation.
1.11. Authorization to Perform Inflight Duties in Non-US Air Force Aircraft.
   1.11.1. With MAJCOM approval, aircrew members in active flying positions, and
   authorized operational support personnel, may perform appropriate duties in non-US Air
   Force aircraft if it is in the interest of the US Government, approved by the authority that
   controls the aircraft, the members are qualified or are authorized to receive training prior to
   qualification and, if applicable, licensed to perform such duties. Prior to authorizing these
   missions, MAJCOMs will ensure a valid requirement for a USAF aircrew member to
   operationally fly exists, which cannot be accomplished in USAF aircraft. For operational
   support flying, justification must show that qualified aircrew or operational support personnel
   of other (non-US Air Force) services or applicable organizations cannot perform such duties.
   Requests to fly solely for the purpose of qualifying for incentive pay or OFDA credit will not
   be approved.
NOTES:
1. MAJCOMs will identify approval authorities in MAJCOM Supplements. Authority may be
delegated below the MAJCOM level.
2. If the aircrew member is not assigned/attached to a MAJCOM for flying duties (such as a
Combatant Command with a geographic area of responsibility), the Air Force air operations
element within that organization will accomplish the MAJCOM function.

3. For members who attend flying training that includes flights in non-USAF aircraft, the orders
directing such activity constitute MAJCOM approval and satisfy validation requirements for
paragraph 1.11.1. The member‘s servicing HARM office will file a copy of the orders in the
member‘s flight record folder as the source document for authorization to fly in non-USAF
aircraft.
4. Aircrew members will perform duties associated with their current aeronautical rating and
aircrew qualification, or when specifically authorized to perform mission-related observation or
evaluation duties. If a waiver is required to accommodate unique requirements, submit request
IAW paragraph 1.7.2.
   1.11.1. (AFGSC) For AFGSC flight surgeons, AFGSC/SGP is the approval authority for
   duties in non-USAF aircraft. Submit request and justification through assigned/attached
   flying unit CC to AFGSC/SGP. For all other AFGSC aircrew members, AFGSC/A3T is the
   approval authority. Submit request and justification through OG/CC to AFGSC/A3TA, who
   will staff to A3T. See approved AFGSC mission requirement memorandum example located
   in the template folder on the following AFGSC internal SharePoint site at https://afgsc-

       1.11.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) For AFGSC flight surgeons, after obtaining written approval
       by assigned/attached flying unit CC, MAJCOM approval for duties in non-USAF aircraft
       can be granted under certain circumstances. AFGSC flight surgeons on active
       aeronautical orders and with a current universal qualification AF Form 8/8a, Certificate
       of Aircrew Qualification, may perform in-flight duties in non-USAF aircraft when:
           1.11.1.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Assigned or attached to AF units that are unable to
           support flight surgeon flying requirements.
           1.11.1.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Providing operational aero medical support while
           participating in joint service or multi-national exercises (e.g., RED FLAG).

           deployed in support of contingency operations (e.g., OPERATION IRAQI
           FREEDOM).
       1.11.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) In above circumstances, the flight surgeon will provide a
       copy of the commander approved mission requirement letter to the servicing HARM
       office for inclusion in the flight record folder. Specific aircrew qualification requirements
       will be determined by host service or host country guidance, IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 2,
       Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, paragraph 5.2.19. As a minimum, aircraft
       egress and emergency procedures training will be accomplished and documented. If
       required for the mission, but not qualified on the specific aircraft, members will log flight
       authorization duty code ―X‖ or ―O‖, and ―Other‖ flight time. AFGSC flight surgeons,
       assigned to an API-5 coded position may perform in-flight duties in non-USAF aircraft
       under any of the following circumstances:
           1.11.1.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Sister service units (active duty), or other allied
           aircraft for whom the local Flight Medicine Element (FME) routinely provides

          1.11.1.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC flight surgeon deployed to forward locations
          in support of real world operations (e.g. OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM) and
          required to provide routine medical support to non-USAF crew members.
      1.11.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) Flight surgeons requesting flights in non-USAF aircraft
      under circumstances that do not meet the above criteria must request specific approval
      through assigned/attached CC to AFGSC/SGP.
      1.11.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) Qualified Para-rescue and Combat Rescue Officer personnel
      (X-coded) are authorized to perform in-flight duties and maintain flying currency on
      foreign and sister service aircraft when in performance of their assigned duties. The
      member will provide a mission requirement letter to the servicing HARM office stating
      the reason the member is required for the mission(s), and listing current qualification in
      the aircraft. The mission requirement letter will be signed by unit CC and approved by
      OG/CC, C-NAF/A3, or in-theater OG/CC equivalent. AFGSC/A3T is approval authority
      for MAJCOM Staff. Specific aircrew qualification requirements will be determined by
      host service or host country guidance, IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 2, paragraph 5.2.19. As a
      minimum, aircraft egress and emergency procedures training will be accomplished and
      documented. If required for the mission, but not qualified on the specific aircraft,
      members will log ―XJ‖ and ―Other‖ time.
   1.11.2. Performing duties in non-US Air Force aircraft does not remove military personnel
   from line-of-duty determination status. When aircrew members are not assigned to API 7 or
   API G coded positions, MAJCOMs will provide the member‘s HARM office with a letter of
   justification authorizing the member to perform official aircrew duties in non-US Air Force
   aircraft and log flying time IAW paragraph 3.2 HARM offices will use this letter as the
   source document to assign an appropriate aircrew qualification code IAW AFI 11-421.
   1.11.3. Orientation Flights in Non-US Air Force Aircraft. MAJCOMs may authorize
   orientation flights in non-US Air Force aircraft for individuals within their command who are
   otherwise eligible to fly on US Government aircraft. This authority may be delegated, but not
   lower than wing commander or equivalent level. Prior to authorizing such flights, approving
   authorities will ensure a valid requirement exists. Obtain approval from the appropriate
   authority that controls the non-USAF aircraft. The approving office will clearly indicate to
   the non-USAF controlling authority and the foreign government (as applicable) that
   acceptance of an orientation flight does not imply that the USAF/US Government will extend
   a reciprocal invitation to non-USAF or foreign government (as applicable) personnel.
   Individuals will not log flight time on orientation flights. Flights do not satisfy flight pay or
   OFDA requirements.
   1.11.4. USAF Exchange Personnel. See AFI 16-107, Military Personnel Exchange
   Program, for additional guidance regarding USAF exchange personnel flying with foreign
   air forces.
1.12. Requirements for Pilots in Dual Controlled Aircraft.

     commanders, key supervisors, and general officers.
  1.12.3. Dual-control aircraft designated in the aircraft flight manual for single pilot
  operations in IMC/VMC flight may be operated with a single pilot on passenger-carrying
  missions when operational or command mission requirements dictate that two pilots are not
  practical. In addition, the other pilot seat may be used for passengers and/or MEP as defined
  and directed by the MAJCOM. Under no circumstances will a passenger or MEP be given
  control of the aircraft.
  1.12.4. Pilots and other aircrew members not authorized to obtain or maintain aircraft
  qualification will not occupy a seat with a set of controls with passengers or MEP on board.
  EXCEPTIONS:

NOTES:
1. APIs 1, 2, and A are for officers and CEAs assigned to line flying positions or assigned to
   formal flying training programs. The primary duty of these crewmembers is flying.
2. API 3, 4, 6, 8, B, C, D, and E identify crewmembers assigned to supervisory or staff
   positions. These positions require aircrew expertise (API 3, 4, 6, 8, B, D, and E) and some
   require active flying (API 6, 8, B, and D) or ground based radar duties (API 6, 8).
3. If more than one crewmember is assigned to an API-5, 6, 8, B, and D position, only the pri-
   mary designated incumbent will be assigned an active FAC/FSC code and fly. The
   MAJCOM/SGPA or higher will determine which flight surgeons are designated as the
   primary incumbent.
4. If replacement of the primary incumbent is necessary (for example, PCS, permanent change
   of assignment, etc.), the replacement may also be authorized an active FAC/FSC code, pro-
   vided the overlap is not more than 30 days. (Reference paragraph 1.4.2.1.)
5. Qualified medical officers assigned to flight surgeon and pilot-physician, when not assigned
   to an operational flying squadron as a primary line flier, positions.
6. Officers/CEAs assigned to flying positions outside of USAF or duties requiring active flying
   with foreign services.
7. API 0 and Z identify non-rated/non-CEA positions.

 Z Active-Remotely Pilot Aircraft (RPA) Duties. Pilot, navigator/CSO, ABM or CEAs
   (1AXXX or 1UXXX DAFSCs) assigned to an RPA approved by SecAF for OFDA credit
   and performing operational RPA duties.

NOTES:
1. The FSC indicates if a member is assigned to an active or inactive flying position and the
reason for inactivity. Rated members assigned to mandatory rated flying duties must fly in an
active status if otherwise qualified. If the unit commander determines that no flying support
capability exists for these officers, assign an inactive FSC. All rated aircrew members assigned
to non-flying duties or non-rated flying are restricted from active rated flying. MAJCOMs assign
support-flying priorities according to paragraph 2.7. when adequate resources are lacking.
2. ARMS automatically generates an FSC change for ASC G; no AO is required.
3. Do not process non-performance AOs (FSC S) for rated officers after 18 years of aviation
service or CEAs after 20 years of aviation service. Refer to AFIs 11-202, Vol 1, and 11-402
flying evaluation board requirement procedures, for members assigned to active flying positions
who do not fly for extended periods for reasons within their control.
4. HARM offices will process an AO to assign FSC P or R effective the date of the separation or
retirement orders, update ARMS, and terminate flight pay (if applicable). ARC members
entering a PAS Code starting with S7 will be assigned FSC P or FSC R upon effective date of
orders.
5. When nonrated/non-CEA members are assigned to a dual-coded flying/jump position, assign
FSC D. When no longer assigned to the dual-coded jump/flying position, change the member‘s
FSC from D to J. When a member is re-assigned from a dual-coded position to a jump DAFSC
(or J prefixed position) only, change the member‘s FSC to E.
2.4. Operational Flying Duty. Operational flying duty is flying duty performed under
competent orders while serving in assignments in which flying skills are maintained in the
performance of assigned duties. The FY 1996 National Defense Authorization Act established
current guidance for months of operational flying duty accumulation (OFDA) required for
entitlement to continuous monthly incentive pay for specific years of aviation service. Current
legal authority is established in the US Code. Table 2.7 shows OFDA requirements.

Table 2.7. OFDA Requirements.

Act             OFDA Requirement/Milestone Entitlement
NDAA of 1996 96 mos (12 yrs of aviation svc)      Continuous ACIP until 18 yrs of aviation
                                                  service
                See Note, below.
                120 mos (18 yrs of aviation svc) Continuous ACIP until 22 yrs from OSD/ASD
                144 mos (18 yrs of aviation svc) Continuous ACIP until 25 yrs from OSD/ASD
Note: Transition Status Codes were established to track the OFDA requirements for rated
officers affected by the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the Aviation Career Improvement
Act of 1989, and the FY 1996 National Defense Authorization Act. TSC A is assigned to all
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                               53


officers who had less than 6 years of aviation service on 1 October 1991. For additional TSC
guidance, reference instructions applicable when member‘s aviation service date was
established. (Historic copies of AFI 11-401 are available from AF/A3O-AT.)


2.5. Rated Officer and Career Enlisted Aviator Operational Flying Duty. To control the
award of operational flying duty credit required by public law, HARM offices must assign active
operational fliers (FSC A) or ground-based radar duty (FSC B) who fail to perform flying or
ground-based radar duty to a temporary status, FSC S (Inactive-Nonperformance) IAW
paragraph 2.5.3.4 or 2.5.3.5. FSC S will remain valid until: the member accomplishes an OFDA-
creditable event; is disqualified for Aviation Service; or is reassigned to non-flying duty. Active
rated officers and CEAs recommended for DNIF are identified in ARMS by a physical
availability date and code. When the DNIF is expected to last more than 30 days or has lasted for
30 days, ARMS automatically reports the member on the Consolidated Headquarters Aviation
Resource Management System interface as FSC G. (The FSC G is for reporting purposes only.)
An AO change is not necessary. Members continue to accumulate OFDA credit until FSC S
applies.
   2.5.1. Operational event is flying or ground-based radar duty performed under competent
   orders by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which basic flying
   skills are normally maintained in the performance of assigned duties as determined by the
   Secretary of the Air Force.
       2.5.1.1. Operational flying includes members in training that leads to the award of an
       aeronautical rating or designation. Rated officers and CEAs must attain and maintain, as
       a minimum, basic aircraft qualification in mission or support aircraft. One of the
       following indicates the need to fly:
           2.5.1.1.1. The assigned API code associated with a specific position.
           2.5.1.1.2. Assignment to a formal course of flying instruction.
           2.5.1.1.3. A case-by-case determination by AF/A3O-A when unusual circumstances
           dictate.
   2.5.2. The requirement for the Air Force to track the flying activity of rated members is
   based on public law. The FY 99 National Defense Authorization Act NDAA changed the
   way ACIP entitlement was computed for all rated officers. Previously, eligibility
   determination was based on the anniversary of the Officer Service Date (OSD). The FY 99
   NDAA changed eligibility determination to the anniversary of the ASD.
   2.5.3. OFDA Computations. To receive credit for a month of OFDA, an individual must:
       2.5.3.1. Be assigned to primary or corollary duties that require flying or ground-based
       radar duty and perform valid flying or ground-based radar duty which are authorized
       OFDA credit in the current month or preceding three months.
           2.5.3.1.1. After establishment of an ASD as an ABM and assigned to OFDA-
           creditable ground based radar duty will receive OFDA credit for those duties. ABMs
           must fly a minimum of six years (72 months) of aircraft-based operational flying duty
54                                                 AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


        accumulator (OFDA) credit by the 12th year of aviation service to be eligible for
        continuous ACIP beyond their 12 year gate.
     2.5.3.2. Be assigned to rated/CEA in-flight or similar RP duties while assigned FSC A,
     B, U, X, or Z for at least 15 days within each calendar month that earned OFDA credit
     from the current month or previous three months. Rated officers or CEA members
     assigned to an active flying billet pending a PCS assignment to an inactive billet should
     sign out from the losing base after the 15day of the month in order to receive OFDA
     credit for that month. They must have also performed OFDA-creditable flying within
     three months of the departure month.
     2.5.3.3. Have no more than 18 years of aviation service for rated officers and 20 years of
     aviation service for career enlisted aviators. Note: If required, members may accumulate
     badge-creditable OFDA months toward advanced rating criteria after the 18th or 20th
     year of aviation service. See AFI 11-402.
     2.5.3.4. Individuals initially assigned to flying duty (FSC A) or ground-based radar duty
     (FSC B), or returning to such duty from a disqualified or inactive status, other than FSC
     S, receive OFDA credit from the date of assignment of an active FSC. If such individuals
     do not fly within three months of that date, the HARM office will retroactively change
     the active FSC to FSC S, effective the day following the date of initial assignment of the
     active FSC. Deduct OFDA credit which began accruing with assignment of the original
     active FSC and terminate entitlement to OFDA credit. Assign an active FSC when flying
     or ground-based radar duty begins, effective two months before the date of the first flight.
     OFDA credit resumes from that date. Example: Captain Miller is assigned FSC A on 19
     December but first flies on 17 April: On 20 March, the HARM changes the FSC A to
     FSC S, effective 20 December. Captain Miller accumulated three months OFDA credit
     for January, February, and March. (Do not credit December because Capt Miller was
     assigned an active FSC for less than 15 days during that month.) The FSC S action
     deducts the three months credited and stops further accumulation. On 17 April, change
     the FSC S to FSC A, effective 17 February. This retroactive change restarts OFDA credit.
     Do not award OFDA credit for February (less than 15 days assigned), but award credit
     for March and April. Credit continues to accumulate until the individual fails to perform
     for a period greater than three months.
     2.5.3.4. (AFGSC) HARM must include remarks on AO indicating reason member was
     unable to perform an OFDA creditable flight. Example: Non-flying TDY, Extended
     DNIF, Awaiting Formal Flying Course, etc.
     2.5.3.5. When aircrew members who are actively flying prior to reaching 18 years (rated)
     and 20 years (CEA) of aviation service do not perform by the end of the third month
     following the month in which flying duties were last performed, change FSC to S
     effective the first day of the fourth month following the month in which flying duties
     were last performed and stop OFDA credit. Change the FSC to A again effective the date
     of the member‗s next OFDA-creditable flight. Do not award retroactive credit. Example:
     Lt Rochon flew on 14 May and did not fly again until 18 November: The HARM office
     assigns FSC S on 1 September. Credit OFDA for May, June, July, and August. The
     HARM office changes the FSC back to A on 18 November. There is no OFDA credit for
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                              55


       November because the member was assigned FSC A for less than 15 days during that
       month. OFDA credit is not earned in September and October.
       2.5.3.5. (AFGSC) HARM must include remarks on AO indicating reason member was
       unable to perform an OFDA creditable flight. Example: Non-flying TDY, Extended
       DNIF, Awaiting Formal Flying Course, etc.
       2.5.3.6. Unit commanders will notify the servicing HARM office when an ABM
       assigned to OFDA-creditable ground based radar duties prior to reaching 18 years of
       aviation service does not perform crew duties by the end of the third month following the
       month in which crew duties were last performed. HARM office personnel will change the
       member‘s FSC to S effective the first day of the fourth month following the month in
       which crew duties were last performed and stop OFDA credit. Change the FSC to B
       effective the date the member resumes crew duties. Do not award retroactive credit.
2.6. OFDA Waivers. Operational flying duty requirements for officers and CEAs are
established by public law. IAW AFI 36-2110, Assignments, it is Air Force policy that as many
rated officers as possible complete at least 10 years (120 months) of operational flying by the
18th year of aviation service, however not all officers will fulfill the requirements to receive
ACIP through 25 years of aviation service. For CEAs, Air Force policy is to manage CEAs to
complete at least 9 years (108 months) of operational flying by the 15year of aviation service;
not all CEAs will fulfill the requirements to receive CEFIP through 25 years of aviation service.
The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) may waive OFDA requirements for rated officers and
CEAs who are unable to meet their flying requirements due to reasons beyond their control. Each
year, MAJCOM commanders may submit nominations for Lieutenant Colonels and below and
SMSgts and below to AF/A3O-AT, for Colonels (and selectees) to AF/DPO, and for CMSgts
(and selectees) to AF/DPE, for review and staffing to SECAF. To implement this program the
following procedures apply:
2.6. (AFGSC)OFDA Waivers. During annual record reviews at the member‘s 11th and 17th
(Rated) and 9th and 14th (CEA) years of aviation service, HARMs will document on the IDS if
member may be eligible for an OFDA waiver. Member will sign the IDS acknowledging OFDA
status, and in any case retains responsibility for understanding career OFDA requirements and
preparing any waiver requests.
   2.6.1. Rated officers and CEAs are eligible for OFDA waiver consideration.
       2.6.1.1. Rated officer candidates must have at least 72 months (6 years) of OFDA credit
       to apply for a waiver.
       2.6.1.2. CEA candidates must accomplish at least 60 months (5 years) of operational
       flying during the first 10 years of aviation service, or 96 months (8 years) of operational
       flying duties during the first 15 years of aviation service to apply for a waiver.
       2.6.1.3. Officers and CEAs who have not accumulated the minimum number of months
       shown above are not eligible for waiver consideration.
       2.6.1.4. In addition to meeting established criteria in this section (paragraph 2.6), an
       ABM must have an established ASD and be eligible to receive ACIP.
56                                                  AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


     2.6.1.5. By direction of the SECAF, third gate waivers, for individuals to receive ACIP
     or CEFIP through 25 years of aviation service when OFDA requirements have not been
     met, will not be considered.
     2.6.1.6. Retroactive waivers may be approved for rated officers who obtain 72 months of
     OFDA credit after the 12th year of aviation service. Members will be authorized
     continuous entitlement to ACIP from the month in which they completed 72 months
     credit. (Members are not qualified for continuous entitlement prior to meeting
     qualification requirements.) Example: Major Standish reached her 12th year of aviation
     service on 18 January 09 and had accumulated 60 months of OFDA credit, 36 months
     short of the 12 year requirement, and was assigned ASC 5A, conditional entitlement
     status. Effective 17 January 10 she accumulated 72 months of OFDA and applied for a
     waiver of her 12th year requirement on that date. SECAF approved an OFDA waiver on
     15 June 10 and Major Standish‘s HARM office was directed to publish an AO changing
     Major Standish‘s ASC from 5A to 2A and start continuous ACIP effective 17 January 10.
     Note: CEAs are not eligible for retroactive waivers.
     2.6.1.7. For OFDA waiver requests submitted from the MAJCOM or equivalent, and
     approved by SECAF prior to loss of continuous pay, members will be authorized
     continuous entitlement to ACIP or CEFIP from the requirement anniversary date (if
     otherwise qualified).
     2.6.1.8. For OFDA waiver requests submitted from the MAJCOM or equivalent, and
     approved by SECAF after the loss of continuous pay, members will be authorized
     entitlement to ACIP or CEFIP from the date the member submitted the original request to
     the first office in the member‘s MAJCOM or equivalent chain of command (if otherwise
     qualified).
  2.6.2. MAJCOM commanders may submit OFDA waiver nominations only when the
  member failed to achieve requirements due to reasons beyond his or her control. Examples
  include, but are not limited to: banked UPT graduates, extended DNIFs, rated officers
  assigned to deactivating/draw down flying units or Air Liaison Officer assignments who
  cannot be placed into another flying position prior to completion of 120 months of OFDA
  credit at 18 years of aviation service, rated officers assigned to non-flying duties necessary to
  comply with the requirements of the Goldwater-Nichols Act (joint duty schools/follow-on
  tours) or the Acquisition Public Law, and CEAs assigned to inactive flying billets to perform
  RPA sensor operator duties.
     2.6.2.1. Officers and CEAs selected for highly competitive and nominative assignments
     merit OFDA waiver consideration, when those assignments are specifically responsible
     for rated officers and CEAs failing to accomplish OFDA requirements. Should such
     assignments jeopardize the achievement of OFDA requirements, place appropriate
     documentation in the member‘s personnel record. Documentation will include reasons
     why the member was assigned to a non-flying position (see paragraph 2.6.6).
     2.6.2.2. Waiver packages are considered on a case-by-case basis, to include objective
     and subjective assessment of the member‘s request. Eligibility for waiver consideration
     does not ensure waiver approval.
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                            57


  2.6.3. Rated officers receiving acquisition bonus monies may not be eligible for OFDA
  waivers.
  2.6.4. Months lost due to time spent under flying status code K (Inactive--lack of support) do
  not meet OFDA waiver criteria unless the officer or CEA was assigned to a unit undergoing
  draw down or conversion to an aircraft in which the individual‘s specialty was not required,
  or when the unit aircraft was operationally grounded (paragraph 1.3.2). Individuals must
  meet both K code and draw down, conversion, or grounding criteria to be considered for a
  waiver. EXCEPTION: Members in active flying/ground-based radar assignments assigned
  flying status code K while deployed TDY to non-flying assignments IAW Table 2.6 are
  eligible for waiver consideration.
  2.6.5. Individuals who voluntarily turn down a flying opportunity or elect to move to a non-
  flying position which would preclude the possibility of meeting OFDA requirements are not
  eligible for OFDA waivers (except as may be provided for in paragraph 2.6.2.1).
     2.6.5.1. When an individual declines an opportunity to fly and is selected for a non-
     flying assignment, document this action in the member‘s personnel record, as specified in
     paragraph 2.6.6 Reference the flying assignment that was declined.
  2.6.6. AFPC, HQ USAF, or MAJCOM assignment officers, as applicable, will document
  situations that exist at the time of assignment which may preclude a member from meeting
  OFDA requirements, to establish an audit trail. (MAJCOMs will verify flying status code K
  criteria.) Documentation may be used to verify why OFDA waiver candidates were unable to
  accomplish OFDA requirements.
  2.6.7. MAJCOMs are responsible to ensure each individual eligible for an OFDA waiver is
  considered for a waiver.
     2.6.7.1. Submit OFDA waiver requests to the servicing HARM office no earlier than the
     year prior to loss of flight pay.
     2.6.7.1. (AFGSC) To allow for sufficient processing time, submit waiver requests to the
     local HARM not later than 6 months prior to the month in which the member meets the
     gate he or she is expected to fail. Late submissions will be processed; however, HARMs
     must brief the member of a potential interruption of flight pay.
         2.6.7.1.1. HARM offices will staff requests to the MAJCOM.
         2.6.7.1.1. (AFGSC) Forward requests for operational flying duty accumulator
         (OFDA) waivers to HQ AFGSC/A3TA, 245 Davis Ave E, Barksdale AFB LA 71110
         prior to the loss of flight pay.
         2.6.7.1.2. For members not assigned to an Air Force MAJCOM (i.e. members
         assigned to organizations such as USCENTCOM, USPACOM, or USSTRATCOM),
         individuals will submit packages to their servicing Air Force HARM office, which
         will staff packages to the MAJCOM that is in the HARM office‘s chain of command.
         2.6.7.1.3. For members assigned to Headquarters, USAF, submit waivers through the
         individual‘s supervisory chain of command (A1, A3, A4, etc.), then to A3O-AT,
         DPO, or DPE.
 58                                                  AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


       2.6.7.2. HARM offices will review OFDA packages for accuracy, ensure all required
       items are included, and validate eligibility criteria IAW this instruction. For members
       assigned to Headquarters, USAF, members will provide required items (listed below).
       HAF members may contact the AF/A1 staff or AF/A3O-AT to validate eligibility for
       waiver consideration.
          2.6.7.2.1. OFDA waiver request packages will include the member‘s dated request
          letter, Aviation Service Worksheet, justification for OFDA request, Military
          Personnel Data System duty history (SURF), and any other documents necessary to
          support justification.
          2.6.7.2.2. MAJCOMs will coordinate with AFPC (N/A for ARC personnel) to ensure
          support for packages when waivers are based on assignment actions. For HAF
          members, the AF/A1 staff will accomplish AFPC coordination.
          2.6.7.2.3. It is the responsibility of the member submitting the OFDA waiver request
          to establish adequate justification for waiver consideration.
   2.6.7.3. Packages forwarded to HAF for SECAF approval must contain MAJCOM/CC (or
   equivalent) or HAF (2-letter or equivalent in the member‘s chain of command) indorsement.
   Forward OFDA waiver nominations for Lieutenant Colonels and below and SMSgts and
   below to AF/A3O-AT, for Colonels (and selectees) to HQ AF/DPO, and for CMSgts (and
   selectees) to AF/DPE. If submission is not warranted, MAJCOM commanders/equivalents or
   HAF senior officers may deny requests.
          2.6.7.3.1. Prior to MAJCOM commander/HAF senior officer approval,
          MAJCOM/HAF POCs may send OFDA waiver packages to AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO,
          or AF/DPE for an informal review; however, POCs will accomplish the initial review
          prior to submitting packages to HAF offices.
   2.6.8. AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE will verify that packages meet eligibility criteria.
   AF/A3O-AT (or AF/DPO/DPE) and AF/A1 staff representatives will review packages. If all
   offices concur, nominations will be forwarded through the HAF chain of command to
   SECAF for consideration for an OFDA waiver. Packages that do not meet eligibility criteria
   will be returned to the MAJCOM. Waivers will be approved only for the minimum months
   required.
       2.6.8.1. Individuals who receive an OFDA waiver are not eligible for a second OFDA
       waiver. For individuals who receive waivers, the specific eligibility requirement is
       waived for the minimum extent necessary for that individual; members are not granted
       additional months of OFDA credit.
2.7. Taking Part in Flying by Rated Officers. Public law and DoD directives restrict active
rated flying to officers in positions that require members to maintain flying skills.
   2.7.1. Flying duties are assigned in the following precedence:
       2.7.1.1. API 1 or 2 officers assigned to support the weapon system crew ratio.
       2.7.1.2. Student officers assigned to a formal course of flying training.
       2.7.1.3. Officers assigned to positions coded API 6 or 8.
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                              59


      2.7.1.4. Officers assigned to positions at MAJCOM or FOA level or below coded API 3
      or 4, or non-rated (API 0). Assign such officers to rated aircrew duties on the basis of the
      most recent aviation service date, if:
          2.7.1.4.1. The assignment provides at least 24 months of local flying availability (12
          months at short tour bases).
          2.7.1.4.2. The flying assignment is to an approved operational support mission
          specifically designated by HQ USAF.
      2.7.1.5. Rated officers will not perform flying duties during periods of non-flying TDY,
      permissive TDY, or while on leave. EXCEPTION: ARC members on terminal leave
      from active duty, who are otherwise eligible to fly, may perform flight duties.
      2.7.1.6. Officers (excluding the primary aircrew) accomplishing orientation flights fly in
      passenger status and will not perform flying duties.
   2.7.2. Special Circumstances.
      2.7.2.1. If special circumstances require active temporary operational flying that is not
      IAW paragraph 2.7.1, MAJCOM/A3 may approve exceptions on an individual case basis
      (FAC 6/E waiver). See Table 2.2
      2.7.2.2. If special circumstances require rated officers to perform temporary in-flight
      non-rated or non-crew (operational support) duties, HARM offices will assign FAC 8.
      For rated officers who were in inactive status, publish an AO assigning FAC 8, FSC J,
      and include in the remarks section of AO: ―Rated Officer assigned to perform in-flight
      non-rated (or non-crew) duties.‖ Officers performing non-rated duties will log aircrew
      certification code Z on the AFTO Form 781; flight time does not count towards OFDA or
      ACIP entitlement.
   2.7.3. Do not assign active flying duties to members scheduled for an academic instruction
   course of 180 days or longer. The HARM office will assign FSC L to these members. (See
   also Table 2.6.)
   2.7.4. Reserve officers not on extended active duty (EAD) may be assigned to inactive rated
   positions (API 3 or API 4).
      2.7.4.1. Send requests for removing Reservists from flying to AFRC/A3TB (with copies
      to AF/REO and AF/A3O-AT) for approval.
      2.7.4.2. Send requests for removing ANG personnel from flying to NGB/CF (with a
      copy to AF/A3O-AT) for approval.
   2.7.5. Rated officers assigned to API 0 billets may fly on a non-interference basis when
   required. Incentive pay and OFDA credit are not authorized for non-interference flying.
   Members will not log flying time on the AFTO form 781. (See also paragraph 2.10.4).
2.8. Flight Surgeon, Pilot-Physician, and Critical Care Air Transport Team Flying Policy.
   2.8.1. To be assigned to active flying status, a flight surgeon must be medically qualified,
   physiologically qualified (if applicable), and maintain flight medicine credentials. To receive
   conditional ACIP, active flight surgeons must be assigned to an API 5 unit manpower
   document (UMD) position with Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC) 48XX, or 40C0C
60                                                 AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


  with an additional AFSC of 48XX, be on active flying status AOs, and be qualified in the
  aircraft. IAW DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 7a, Military Pay Policy and Procedures -
  Active Duty and Reserve Pay, flight surgeons are conditional fliers and qualify for
  entitlement to conditional ACIP by completing the prescribed number of operational flying
  hours per month.
     2.8.1.1. Commanders may authorize inactive flight surgeons to fly and log time without
     ACIP on a noninterference basis with unit training and flying schedules. Flight surgeons
     not qualified in an aircraft, on inactive AOs, will log only ―Other‖ flight time and include
     remarks on the reverse side of AFTO Form 781 (for example, ―Inactive flight surgeon,‖
     or ―Flight surgeon not qualified in aircraft‖). Paragraphs 2.14.3 and 2.14.5 apply.
     2.8.1.2. When a flight surgeon is assigned to an API 0 position, the HARM office will
     terminate active flying AOs and assign the member ASC 8J. Paragraph 2.14.7 applies.
  2.8.2. A flight surgeon possessing an additional pilot or navigator rating and assigned to an
  API 5 flight surgeon position flies only as a flight surgeon, unless selected and approved as a
  pilot-physician or navigator-physician IAW AFI 11-405, The Pilot-Physician Program.
  Pilot-physicians/navigator-physicians assigned to active flying positions (API 1/2) fly as line
  pilots/navigators. AF/A3/5 authorizes exceptions upon request, based on justification
  provided by the Surgeon General (AF/SG). Flight surgeons who hold valid pilot or navigator
  ratings are entitled to conditional ACIP only; OFDA credit is not authorized, even when
  members are assigned to API 1/2 positions.
  2.8.3. Pilot-Physicians Procedures. AFI 11-405 prescribes procedures for the US Air
  Force Pilot-Physician Program. Pilot-physicians remain conditional fliers for ACIP
  entitlement and do not earn OFDA credit. Except as noted above, active flying pilot-
  physicians will be assigned ASC 8A, FAC 9, and API 5, and hold DAFSC 48VX. Retain
  members in ASC 8 beyond 25 years of aviation service. Credit flight time logged as a pilot
  towards advanced pilot and flight surgeon ratings (only when member is assigned FAC 9)
  and ACIP entitlement.
  2.8.4. Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATT) Procedures. Active and inactive
  flight surgeons may be tasked to assist CCATTs with patients on a mission.
     2.8.4.1. Active flight surgeons assigned to API 5 positions, with ASC 8A, are authorized
     to log crew position ―FS‖ and primary time on all USAF aircraft missions based on their
     aircraft qualification.
     2.8.4.2. Inactive flight surgeons assigned to API 0 positions, in ASC 8J and tasked to
     perform CCATT non-crew duties, are authorized to log ―FZ‖ crew position and primary
     time on these missions. Flight time may only be logged when critical care patients are
     onboard. When authorized, the member‘s HARM office will process the operational
     support AO. Assign FAC 8, and include AO remarks: ―Rated officer tasked to perform
     CCATT non-crew FAC 8 duties. Crew position FZ and non-crew HDIP authorized.‖ The
     member‘s ASC remains ASC 8J.
  2.8.5. Flight surgeons, pilot-physicians, and CCATT personnel will not perform flying
  duties during periods of non-flying TDY, permissive TDY, or while on leave.
  EXCEPTION: ARC members on terminal leave from active duty, who are otherwise eligible
  to fly, may perform flight duties.
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                               61


   2.8.6. Members accomplishing orientation flights fly in passenger status and will not
   perform flying duties.
   2.8.7. (Added-AFGSC) The HARM will notify AFGSC/SGP via letter/e-mail and info
   AFGSC/A3TA, each time an active flight surgeon exceeds the 60-days between flights. Non-
   current flight surgeons are considered grounded and must complete requirements of the
   MDS-specific, Vol I, for the aircraft on which they are obtaining/maintaining qualification
   prior to next flight.
2.9. Taking Part in Flying by Career Enlisted Aviators.
   2.9.1. Flying duties are assigned in the following precedence:
      2.9.1.1. API A or B CEAs assigned to support the weapon system crew ratio, flying
      training instruction duty, operational test and evaluation functions, Foreign Military Sales
      (FMS), etc.
      2.9.1.2. Students assigned to a formal course of flying training.
      2.9.1.3. Career enlisted aviators assigned to positions coded API B or D.
      2.9.1.4. Career enlisted aviators assigned to positions at MAJCOM or FOA level or
      below coded API C or E. Assign career enlisted aviators API C or E aircrew duties on the
      basis of the most recent aviation service and be careful not to cause the member to fall
      short of meeting OFDA credit.
   2.9.2. Do not assign active flying duties to members who are scheduled for an academic
   instruction course of 180 days or more.
   2.9.3. Career enlisted aviators will not perform flying duties during periods of non-flying
   TDY, permissive TDY, or while on leave. EXCEPTION: ARC members on terminal leave
   from active duty, who are otherwise eligible to fly, may perform flight duties.
   2.9.4. Career enlisted aviators (excluding the primary aircrew) accomplishing orientation
   flights fly in passenger status and will not perform flying duties.
   2.9.5. If special circumstances require active temporary flying that is not IAW paragraph
   2.9.1, MAJCOM/A3 may approve exceptions on an individual case basis (FAC E waiver).
   2.9.5. (AFGSC) Submit requests for FAC E waivers for inactive aircrew members requiring
   active temporary (180 days or less) operational flying to HQ AFGSC/A3TA NLT 30
   Calendar days prior to pending TDY. For FAC E waivers requiring AF/A3O-A approval,
   send requests to AFGSC/A3TA NLT 30 Calendar days prior to FAC E effective date.
   2.9.6. CEAs assigned to API-Z billets may fly on a non-interference basis when required.
   Incentive pay and OFDA credit are not authorized for non-interference flying. Members will
   not log flying time on the AFTO Form 781. (See also paragraph 2.10.4).
2.10. Taking Part in Flying by Non-rated Officer Aircrew Members and Non-CEA
Enlisted Aircrew Members.
   2.10.1. Non-rated officer and non-CEA enlisted aircrew members (FSC D) are qualified
   personnel assigned to designated aircrew positions. Non-rated/non-CEA aircrew members
   are included onboard aircraft when their presence is required for the aircraft to accomplish its
   primary tasked mission. This is their full-time duty. When a full-time presence is not
62                                                 AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


  required, operational support flying may be applicable (see paragraph 2.10.2). Non-
  rated/non-CEA aircrew members will maintain flying class III physicals.
     2.10.1.1. Non-CEA enlisted aircrew members require an aircrew prefix of X (Basic
     Aircrew), K (Instructor), or Q (Evaluator).
     2.10.1.2. Non-rated officer aircrew members may be assigned to duty positions with an
     AFSC prefix of X (Basic Aircrew), B (Squadron Operations Officer), C (Commander), F
     (Flight Test), K (Instructor), or Q (Evaluator).
         2.10.1.2.1. When a non-rated officer aircrew member and/or parachutist is assigned
         to an authorized X or J (Jump) prefixed UMD position which is also a Commander (C
         prefix) or a Squadron Operations Officer (B prefix) position, the C/B prefix does not
         remove the authorization to fly or jump. Place the following remark on the
         individual‘s AO: ―Member occupies an X (or J) prefix UMD position.‖
         2.10.1.2.2. FSC J (Inactive) or L (TDY School) identifies aircrew members not
         assigned to active flying positions. AOs terminate authorization to fly and entitlement
         to incentive pay.
  2.10.2. FSC C (Operational Support) identifies non-rated/non-CEA personnel required to
  perform essential inflight duties that cannot be accomplished by rated officers, CEAs or non-
  rated aircrew members. Operational Support fliers may be required to perform flight duties
  on an occasional basis. However, their assigned full-time duties do not require them to be
  onboard the aircraft to accomplish its assigned primary mission. When the requirement to fly
  terminates, flight record responsibility ends. Authorized man-months are required prior to
  issuance of AOs. Process requests for operational support flying IAW AFI 11-402.
  2.10.2. (AFGSC) The HARM must brief FSC C individuals to pick up the FRF prior to
  departing PCS, retiring or separating. Also, individuals should be advised to safeguard and
  retain the FRF in the event they are placed on flying status at a later date. If an individual
  departs PCS, retires, or separates, etc., without picking up his/her FRF, use disposition
  guidance in AFRIMS.
  2.10.3. Aerospace physiologists (DAFSC 43AX), Human Performance Training Teams
  (DAFSC 4M0X1), and non-aircrew aerospace medicine personnel(DAFSCs 42GX and
  4N0XXs) are authorized to participate in aircraft flights as observers on a noninterference
  basis. HARM offices will publish AOs according to this instruction and MAJCOM
  directives. Neither ACIP entitlement nor OFDA credit are authorized. Personnel who provide
  high altitude airdrop mission support qualify for Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP).
  Paragraphs 2.14.3 and 2.14.5 apply. Personnel who fly in support of high altitude airdrop
  missions will comply with AFI 11-402.
  2.10.4. Other non-rated/non-CEA personnel who fly occasionally to perform specific tasks
  (e.g., administrative duties, evaluation of equipment, maintenance, passenger escort, security
  for classified documents, crew chiefs who perform duties on the ground at the final
  destination or points enroute and other duties not authorized as operational support IAW AFI
  11-402) may have AOs published according to this instruction and MAJCOM directives.
  Individuals in these categories will fly on a non-interference basis. Neither flying incentive
  pay nor OFDA credit is authorized. Paragraphs 2.14.3 and 2.14.5 apply.
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                               63


       2.10.4.1. Members who fly on non-interference AOs will not be placed on the AFTO
       Form 781 (see paragraph 1.6.2.2), except for those members specified in paragraph
       3.2.1.5.2
       2.10.4.1. (AFGSC) Non-interference flying status will be authorized by WG/CC and
       documented on AF Form 1887, for a period not to exceed 12 months. Do not enter non-
       interference members in ARMS. See approved AFGSC non-interference request example
       located in the template folder on the following AFGSC internal SharePoint site at
       https://afgsc-p.eis.af.mil/internal/a3-5/A3T/a3tacop/default.aspx
       2.10.4.2. Non-Aircrew personnel who fly occasionally to obtain familiarity with the
       flying environment or directed to perform specific inflight duties on an infrequent or
       irregular basis (Commanders [including unit commanders], Operations Officers, and
       supervisory personnel) may do so under the guidelines of paragraph 1.6 Non-aircrew
       members assigned to flying unit commander positions may log flying time IAW
       paragraph 3.2.1.5.2
   2.10.5. Aircrew members not formally entered into Initial Qualification Training will fly
   under orientation flight guidelines for familiarization flights IAW paragraph 1.9.4.7.1.2
   2.10.6. Members will not perform flying duties during periods of non-flying TDY,
   permissive TDY, or while on leave. EXCEPTION: ARC members on terminal leave from
   active duty, who are otherwise eligible to fly, may perform flight duties.
   2.10.7. Members participating in orientation flights fly in passenger status and will not
   perform flying duties.

Section 2B—Supervisory Operational Flying Positions

2.11. Supervisory Position Criteria. To conserve available resources, clearly identify rated
officers and CEA supervisory positions (API 6, 8, B, or D) that require the incumbent to actively
fly.
2.12. Supervisory Flying.
   2.12.1. Rated officer and CEA supervisory flying is necessary to ensure that appropriate
   rated staff officers maintain a current and comprehensive background in the overall flying
   operations of the organization.
   2.12.1. (AFGSC) Any supervisory flights involving the use of night vision goggle (NVG)
   equipment will include a prerequisite NVG training session covering preflight and use of the
   night vision goggles unless current and qualified.
       2.12.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Rotary-wing aircraft: rated supervisors unqualified in the
       aircraft are authorized to fly a primary crew position but must meet the following criteria:
       2.12.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Fly with an IP who is also at a set of controls. If the
       Supervisory Flyer is not qualified and will be at a set of controls at any time, other
       passengers will not be flown.
       2.12.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) Attend a senior officer orientation course, and complete all
       required life support and egress training for the aircraft being flown.
64                                                   AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


  2.12.2. Perform supervisory flying to the maximum extent possible in primary mission
  aircraft inventory (PMAI) associated with the position.
  2.12.3. Commanders (including unit commanders) authorized to designate rated and CEA
  supervisory positions must minimize the impact of such flying and designate API 6, 8, B, or
  D positions only when active flying is essential for mission accomplishment. Designating
  authorities are:
     2.12.3.1. General Officer. The Chief of Staff designates general officer operational
     flying positions. Requests for a change of general officer flying status will be submitted
     to AF/A3/5. AF/A3/5 will coordinate changes with AF/DPG. All requests for general
     officer operational flying training must be coordinated with AF/DPG. See Table 2.8 for
     general officer flying authorizations. See paragraph 2.14.1 and Table 2.9 for additional
     guidance on general officer indoctrination fliers.
     2.12.3.2. Colonel. MAJCOMs designate colonel active flying positions (API 6/8) by
     forwarding AF Form 480, Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying Justification, to AF/DPO for
     review and approval (see AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower Requirements). Colonel
     flying positions will be limited to individuals who directly supervise aircraft flying
     operations, flight safety, standardization/evaluation programs, and operational readiness
     inspection programs. Should positions not warrant full time flying, there may be
     justification for the individual to participate in the indoctrination flying program.
     2.12.3.3. Lieutenant Colonel and Below. MAJCOMs designate Lt Colonel-and-below
     rated officer and CEA positions that require active flying IAW AFI 38-201. If the
     position requires an AF Form 480, provide justification for flying on the form. Normally,
     API 8/D positions (NAF/FOA/DRU/MAJCOM) are authorized only in safety, inspector
     general, and standardization/evaluation functional areas in which flying is a requirement
     associated with the position. On occasion, justification may exist for an aircrew member
     to fly while in inactive status; see paragraph 2.14
     2.12.3.3. (AFGSC) All AFGSC Lt Col and below assigned to rated supervisory
     positions (i.e. CC, ops officer, and flight CC below MAJCOM/NAF level) require active
     flying. Incumbents will maintain mission ready status in their primary aircraft. The level
     of aircrew qualification will be determined by the individual's supervisor and the unit
     commander to which the person is attached for flying. EXCEPTION: The level of
     qualification of NAF API-8/D positions will be determined by NAF/A3. Requests for
     additional API-6/B and API-8/D positions will be made through HQ AFGSC/A3TA to
     HQ AFGSC/A3 for approval. Use AF Form 480, Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying
     Justification, to request any API actions.
     2.12.3.4. (Added-AFGSC) Submit all Authorization Change Requests (ACRs) for API
     6, 8, B and D positions to Manpower and Organization Division (HQ AFGSC/A1M), 245
     Davis Ave E Barksdale AFB LA 71110, and coordinate through AFGSC/A3TA and
     appropriate NAF/A3 for review. Requests for additional API 6, 8, B, and D positions will
     be made through HQ AFGSC/A3T to HQ AFGSC/A3 for API 6/B approval and to HQ
     USAF/A3O-AT for API 8/D approval. Use AF Form 480 to request any API actions.
     2.12.3.5. (Added-AFGSC) Crew members of an unlike specialty hired to temporarily
     fill a vacant staff billet (i.e. API 6 or 8 Navigator hired to fill an API 6 or 8 Pilot position)
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                            65


       will not be assigned flying duties until appropriate waivers are obtained from HQ
       USAF/A3O-AT. Submit waiver requests, complete with full explanation/justification to
       HQ AFGSC/A3TA, 245 Davis Ave E Barksdale AFB LA 71110. HQ AFGSC/A3TA will
       staff the request and forward recommended requests to AF/A3O-AT for approval.

Table 2.8. General Officer Flying Positions.
The following general officer positions are authorized operational or indoctrination flying
positions (as shown) when filled by USAF general officers. Individuals flying operationally

NOTES:
1. Combatant Commanders may determine their flying status, based on requirements. Notify
AF/A3/5 of status, with info copy to AF/A3O-AT and AF/DPG.
2. The Chief of Staff will determine the status of the AF/CC position.
3. MAJCOMs may determine the flying status of general officers assigned within their
command, utilizing the available AF/CC-approved operational positions within the command.
This option applies to all approved operational flying positions above wing commander. Current
approved positions are shown in Table 2.8 with most recent HAF authorized status (Note: May
not reflect actual status if a MAJCOM change has been made). If a change is made, notify
AF/A3/5 with an info copy to AF/A3O-AT and AF/DPG.
4. Wing Commander applies to commanders of flying wings (and includes expeditionary flying
wings). Air base and support wing commanders are specifically excluded.
5. Current list of approved general officer operational flying positions is maintained on file in
AF/A3O-AT. AF/A3O-AT maintains records of approval for all general officer operational
flying positions.
6. Individuals in authorized O-6 operational flying positions who have been selected for
promotion to the grade of Brigadier General may continue to fly operationally while assigned to
the O-6 flying position.
2.13. Supervisory Position Limitations. MAJCOMs will establish procedures to review API
6, 8, B, and D supervisory flying positions when incumbents are assigned FSC K (lack of
support) and when adequate support will not be available within six months. Where practical,
convert such positions to API 3, 4, C or E.
2.13. (AFGSC)Supervisory Position Limitations. When assigning Flying Status Code (FSC)
"K" to API 6/8 or B/D, supervisors will provide written notification to the HARM. This
notification will serve as source documentation for subsequent AO publication. HARMs will
send an information copy of the notification to OG/CC and NAF/A3 and maintain the original in
the member's FRF for as long as the member remains in FSC "K." Supervisors will reevaluate
the status of individuals placed in FSC "K" every 180 days.
2.14. Indoctrination Flying. Rated officers and CEAs in inactive status who are required to
perform operational flying on a temporary basis to complete a specific official task (for example,
to evaluate an operational flying procedure, review flying training effectiveness, take part in a
flying exercise or test program, or become familiar with a specific operational weapon system
and procedure) may be authorized indoctrination flying status. The following policy applies:
   2.14.1. MAJCOMs (or MAJCOM equivalents) select and authorize rated staff and CEA
   positions for indoctrination flying. Indoctrination flying allows inflight observations of
   mission equipment or procedures that will benefit the organization. Incumbents must request
   to fly. Take a conservative approach in designating these positions. MAJCOMs (or
68                                                  AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


  MAJCOM equivalents) will establish procedures for approval of indoctrination flying in
  accordance with Table 2.9 MAJCOMs will identify the incumbent by assigning FSC T.
  MAJCOMs may not increase the number of general officer indoctrination fliers without
  AF/CC approval.
  2.14.1. (AFGSC) Due to limited crew member training opportunities and flying hours, it is
  essential for commanders to personally review each request to ensure it is in the best interest
  of the command. Forward requests for indoctrination flying, with supporting rationale,
  through appropriate channels. AFGSC units submit requests to HQ AFGSC/A3TA, 245
  Davis Ave E Barksdale AFB LA 71110, through the NAF/A3. Incumbents of Indoc flying
  positions above NAF level request indoctrination support through appropriate NAF/A3.
  Individuals at wing level will fly in wing assigned aircraft only (HQ AFGSC/A3 may
  approve exceptions on a case-by-case basis). Requests will be forwarded through channels to
  arrive at HQ AFGSC/A3TA 245 Davis Ave E., Barksdale AFB LA 71110, at least 30 days
  prior to the first flight. The HARM will not assign FSC ―T‖ to an inactive flyer without
  written approval from AFGSC/A3.
  2.14.2. MAJCOM commanders must approve the use of command aircraft resources to
  support indoctrination flying for personnel outside their commands. Authorization may be
  delegated, but not lower than MAJCOM level.
  2.14.2. (AFGSC) Incumbents of Indoctrination (Indoc) flying positions not within AFGSC,
  forward request and justification for indoctrination support through appropriate NAF/A3 to
  AFGSC/A3TA for processing/forwarding to AFGSC/A3. HQ AFGSC/A3 is the approval
  authority for Indoc requests not within AFGSC. For Individual Mobilization Augmentees
  (IMA/MA), AFRC/A3 is the final approval for all AFRC aircrew members
  2.14.3. MAJCOMs must ensure individuals complete, before flight, adequate training on
  emergency procedures, life support equipment, and aircraft systems. Individuals must be
  physically and, where required, physiologically qualified.
  2.14.3. (AFGSC) Prior to the first flight, Indoc flyers must also complete a boldface review.
     2.14.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Qualifications. Indoc flyers will maintain a current physical,
     physiological and centrifuge training as required. Indoc flyers may fly in ejection-seat
     aircraft.
         2.14.3.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Restrictions. Indoc flyers who fly on aircraft with
         NVGs as a part of the mission will receive an NVG laboratory training session
         covering, as a minimum, the focus and use of NVGs.
         2.14.3.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) All Indoc flyers will occupy the right cockpit seat (for
         helicopters the left seat). EXCEPTION: General officer Indoc flyers may occupy the
         left cockpit seat (for helicopters the right seat) only when a fully qualified and current
         instructor pilot occupies the opposite cockpit seat.
         2.14.3.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) The pilot in command will ensure Indoc flyers
         complete cockpit familiarization and orientation flight life support training IAW
         AFI11-301V1_AFGSCSUP, Aircrew Life Support (ALS) Program. This training is
         required before each flight unless a formal class was attended as outlined in MDS 11-
         2 series. General officers who will fly an indoctrination flight in a pilot position must
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                            69


          accomplish a Bold Face/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) Test (if applicable) and
          Situational Emergency Procedures Training (SEPT) with an instructor pilot as
          established in the applicable AFI 11- 2MDS-Specific training series. At the unit
          commander's discretion, a cockpit procedural trainer or in-cockpit review session may
          be substituted for the simulator. This training is valid for 30 days.
          2.14.3.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) Indoc flights will not be granted to individuals on
          leave, in lieu of an orientation flight, or to avoid personal travel expenses.
          2.14.3.1.5. (Added-AFGSC) The mission profile and aircraft maneuvers are not
          restricted during Indoctrination flights.
   2.14.4. Indoctrination flights in inactive status do not entitle the member to OFDA credit or
   incentive pay and do not allow authority to change ASCs except to assign FSC T.
   MAJCOMs will ensure indoctrination flying does not impact unit training, and will not
   increase command flying hour allocations.
   2.14.5. Obtaining or maintaining aircraft qualification while in inactive status is not
   authorized. Individuals flying in inactive status may not act as pilot in command and flights
   in single-place aircraft are specifically prohibited. Document indoctrination flights on the
   AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document using Other flight time,
   IAW paragraph 3.3.5
      2.14.5.1. IAW paragraph 1.12.4.3, general officer pilots in authorized indoctrination
      flying positions may occupy a pilot‘s seat with passengers or MEP on board during non-
      critical phases of flight. During such times a current and qualified instructor pilot will
      occupy the other pilot‘s seat. See AFI 11-202, Volume 3, for definition of critical phases
      of flight.
      2.14.5.2. (Added-AFGSC) Logging Flight Time. Indoc flyers will log "O" (Colonel and
      above) or "X" (Lieutenant Colonel and below) as their duty position identifier on AFTO
      Form 781 and log "Other" flight time.
   2.14.6. MAJCOMs may authorize indoctrination flying for individuals assigned to active
   operational flying positions. Do not change FSC.
      2.14.6.1. (Added-AFGSC) General officers, both active and inactive (FSC "T"), who
      perform rated and Airborne Emergency Action Officer (AEAO) duties on a flight will
      use two flight authorization duty codes reflecting the flight time performed in each
      position (rated/non-crew). For rated duties, log first flight authorization duty character
      code IAW AFI 11-401, Table A2.3, that indicates the general's flying status. For AEAO
      duties (non-crew), log the flight authorization duty code "FZ".
   2.14.7. Indoctrination flying is not authorized for individuals assigned to API 0 or Z coded
   positions. EXCEPTION: MAJCOMs may authorize indoctrination flying for CEAs assigned
   to 9G100 positions, and for individuals tasked to perform indoctrination flying duties while
   deployed.

2.16. Attachment for Flying/Parachuting.
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                            71


  2.16.1. Aircrew/parachutist members assigned by PCS/PCA orders to active
  flying/parachutist positions in US Air Force units and organizations without flying facilities
  or aircraft may be attached for flying/parachuting to units with appropriate resources. Intra-
  wing attachments may be approved by the OG/CC. Individuals must request (in writing)
  attachment for flying/jumping through their chain of command to their MAJCOM or
  equivalent. (EXCEPTION: Request for attachment for flying/parachuting is not required if
  flying/parachuting support and a primary unit/aircraft is addressed in a host-tenant
  agreement. Members will provide required information to the servicing HARM office.)
  Approval authority may be delegated as directed by MAJCOMs.
  2.16.1. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3T is responsible for overall management and approval of
  attached API-6/8/B/D flyers in AFGSC. HQ AFGSC/A3 will prioritize AFGSC API-6/8/B/D
  billet support and the prioritized list will be used to determine which MAJCOM/NAF API-
  6/8/B/D authorizations are supported should the aggregate API-6/8/B/D total become
  unsupportable by AFGSC wings.
     2.16.1.1. Request for attachment must include: Individual‘s name, rank, Social Security
     Number (SSN), aviation service date (ASD), aviation service code (ASC), aeronautical
     rating (or badge), expected duration of attachment, date of separation (DOS)/expiration
     of term of service (ETS), assigned duty position title/position number/API code, aircraft
     last qualified in, date last flown, current AO, current AF Form 1042, and requested unit
     of attachment and point of contact. (Parachutists need only provide information
     applicable to parachuting.) Individuals should coordinate flying/parachute qualification,
     currency and attachment with requested units prior to submitting formal request.
     2.16.1.1. (AFGSC) It is the responsibility of the requesting individual to pre-coordinate
     with the prospective unit of attachment. Submit formal requests through the individual‘s
     commander/supervisor to the prospective attached unit training office, for approval of the
     unit commander. Concurrence of the supporting OG/CC is required prior to submission
     to HQ AFGSC.
         2.16.1.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) All personnel seeking attachment for flying must
         submit a request in writing, IAW AFI 11-401, paragraph 2.16.1.1 of the basic
         instruction, to HQ AFGSC/A3TA. See approved AFGSC attachment for flying
         request template located in the template folder on the following AFGSC internal
         SharePoint             site         at        ttps://afgsc-p.eis.af.mil/internal/a3-
         5/A3T/a3tacopsite/default.aspx.Requests may be submitted electronically
         (FGSCA3TAWorkflow@barksdale.af.mil) to expedite the approval process. Scan
         and attach the documents specified in para 2.20.1 of the basic instruction. Forward
         prospective unit of attachment recommendations for approval,
     2.16.1.2. MAJCOMs will develop procedures for attachments within the MAJCOM. For
     attachments outside an individual‘s MAJCOM, submit the request to both MAJCOMs (or
     equivalent) for coordination. For attachments outside the USAF, submit the request to the
     gaining unit‘s MAJCOM equivalent approval authority and the individual‘s parent
     MAJCOM (or equivalent) approval authority for coordination.
     2.16.1.2. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC and NAF aircrew assigned to API-8/D can be attached
     to any appropriate MDS unit within the chain of command once approved by HQ
     AFGSC/A3TA. HQ AFGSC/A3T is the final approval authority for all other attachments
72                                                AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


     within AFGSC. HQ AFGSC/A3 is the approval authority for out-of-command
     attachments.
     2.16.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3TA will review each request, in part to
     ensure no unit is overburdened with attached flyers. In the event a unit has too many
     attached flyers, a different unit may be coordinated with to support the flyer. Once
     approved, HQ AFGSC/A3TA will update and post the master attachment list on its web
     site (ttps://afgsc-p.eis.af.mil/internal/a3-5/A3T/a3tacop/default.aspx) and notify the
     attached flyer and the flyer‘s servicing HARM office. A copy of the approval letter must
     be filed in the member's FRF for the duration of the attachment. No flights will take place
     at the attached unit until approved requests are posted and filed in the flyer‘s FRF. While
     attached flyers may fly with other like-MDS units other than the approved attached unit,
     attached flyers must complete a minimum of 50% of their annual training requirements
     with their unit of attachment. An exception is allowed in the event the unit of attachment
     is deployed and therefore inaccessible to
     2.16.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) Each OG/CC with attached flyers is required to revalidate
     all attached flyers a minimum of once per year, or as changes occur. OG/CC will notify
     AFGSC/A3TA to remove members from the master attachment letter when no longer
     supported due to PCS/PCA, limited resources, etc. On completion of assignment, the
     attached flying position will be terminated. A new by-name request is required according
     to paragraph 2.16.1. of the basic instruction and this supplement whenever a different
     individual requests attachment.
     2.16.1.5. (Added-AFGSC) OG/CC must inform AFGSC/A3TA, in writing, if they
     cannot support additional API-6/8B/D attachments. Units requiring sortie/flying hour
     adjustments due to attached API-8/D training requirements should submit a program
     change request IAW ACCI 11-102 to HQ AFGSC/A3B and provide an info copy to HQ
     AFGSC/A3TA.
     2.16.1.6. (Added-AFGSC) Attached API-6/B personnel assigned to organizations with
     charters to fly with all units, must, when flying with other than their attached unit,
     provide qualification and currency status through homs station PEX/ARMs products.
     Sorties will be provided in close coordination with the unit and appropriate OG/CC. API-
     6 personnel covered under these circumstances shouldaccomplish at least 50 percent of
     their annual training requirements at their unit of primary attachment. The remaining 50
     percent will be equitably accomplished at units for which they provide oversight.
     EXCEPTION: WSEP (Weapons System Evaluation Program). All API-6/8B/D flyers
     with charters to fly with all units, must provide a copy of their approved memorandum of
     attachment, current aeronautical order, AF Form 1042, and any other pertinent mission
     qualifications to the supporting unit.
     2.16.1.7. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC personnel will not be attached to ANG or AFRC for
     the purpose of maintaining RAP requirements. Flying with these units will be authorized
     IAW the provisions of paragraph 2.18., 2.19., and applicable MAJCOM supplements.
     2.16.1.8. (Added-AFGSC) Units of attachment              will   maintain    all   attached
     flyers/parachutist FRF/JRF IAW AFI 11-421.
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                             73

guidance contained in AFI 11-412.
2.18. Flying With AFRC Units.
   2.18.1. Members of the MAJCOM with oversight responsibility are authorized to fly in
   AFRC aircraft when participating in operational readiness inspections (ORIs), aircrew
   standardization and evaluation visits (ASEVs) and higher headquarters evaluation teams on
   scheduled unit visits. Flying is restricted to missions that support unit training objectives,
   contingencies or operational missions, to include those that augment or assist in unit
   conversion.
   2.18.2. Inter-Fly. AFRC operations group commanders are authorized to approve flights
   with AFRC units for aircrew members not assigned or attached to an AFRC unit and are the
   final authority for determining when an active duty/Air National Guard member may fly unit
   aircraft. Such aircrew members must provide operations group commanders with a source for
   validating aircrew qualifications, training and currencies prior to flying. AFRC OG/CCs will
   forward information copies of interfly agreements to the respective NAF/A3. EXCEPTION:
   Those units with an existing written agreement, e.g. TFI/associate units, will follow guidance
   within the agreement.
      2.18.2.1. Interfly agreements may involve the exchange and/or substitution of aircrew
      members and/or aircraft between different MAJCOM units to accomplish flying in
      support of contingencies, exercises or designated missions according to the appropriate
      OPLAN/CONOPS.
      2.18.2.2. During situations where interfly may be an option, aircraft ownership does not

   or assist in unit conversion. (Individuals will not be listed on the ANG web page since they
   are not formally attached to an ANG unit for the purpose of obtaining continuation training.)
   With the deployed commander‘s concurrence, active duty aircrew attached to Air Warrior,
   Combat Archer and Combat Hammer are authorized to fly with ANG units.
   2.19.2. Active duty flying with ANG units for the sole purpose of continuation training (CT)
   is prohibited without approval from the ANG Director of Operations (NGB/A3). (Future
   Total Force [FTF] wings will coordinate active duty CT flying IAW the MAJCOM
   CONOPS). Forward all requests for active duty CT flying support to NGB/A3 with
   appropriate ANG Wing Commander and MAJCOM/A3 concurrence. Requests must include:
   name, rank, office symbol (e.g., 9 AF/DOV), primary aircraft MDS (e.g., F-16C, C-130E),
   aircrew position (e.g., IP, IN), and reason for requested CT support. A complete list of AD
   aircrew approved to fly CT sorties with the ANG is available on the NGB/A3O Portal.
   2.19.3. Active duty aircrew members authorized to fly ANG aircraft in accordance with
   paragraphs 2.18.2 and 2.19.2 may coordinate sortie support directly with the unit. Members
   must provide the supporting unit operations group commander with a source for verifying

                                FLIGHT DOCUMENTATION

Section 3A—Logging of Flight Activity

3.1. Enter and credit flight time. Enter and credit flight time on an individual‘s flight record
when flown in an aircraft, simulator or controlling an RPA according to this instruction and
properly logged on AFTO Form 781 or AF Form 3250. The pilot designated, as ―in command‖
of the aircraft is responsible for making sure the appropriate form is dated and properly
completed, to include specific remarks as required.
3.1. (AFGSC)ARMS is the official source for validating flight activity. If a discrepancy
exists, measures must be taken to ensure the ARMS database reflects the correct information.
This will be accomplished through submission of official source documents (i.e. AFTO Form
781).
3.2. Crediting Flight Time. Credit flying time as follows:
   3.2.1. To credit flight activity, personnel must:
       3.2.1.1. Be physically qualified. The member cannot be in DNIF status and must be
       medically cleared for flying duty, documented on an AF Form 1042.
       3.2.1.2. Be physiologically qualified (if applicable for the aircraft).
       3.2.1.3. Be on AOs to take part in frequent and regular flights as aircrew, to obtain
       aircrew qualification, or as operational support members (IAW AFI 11-402).
       3.2.1.4. Be under an approved aircrew qualification code (based on AF Form 8/8a
       qualification) and aircrew position identifier (Table A2.3) designated on the flight
       authorization for the aircraft. (EXCEPTION: aircrew members authorized to perform
       inflight duties in non-USAF aircraft, IAW paragraph 1.11, will comply with guidance
       applicable to the authority controlling the aircraft in regards to flight authorization
       requirements.)
       3.2.1.5. Be part of the crew complement (AFI 65-503) authorized to perform aircrew
       duties in the aircraft in order to obtain and maintain aircrew qualification, or be required
       for the mission.
           3.2.1.5.1. Individuals required for the mission who are not part of the crew
           complement may log flying time only when specifically authorized to perform duties
           required for the mission (e.g. AEs, CROs, PJs, combat camera, etc), or when
           specifically authorized to perform mission-related observation or evaluation duties.
           Members will comply with all other applicable requirements to include medical
           clearance and physiological training (if applicable).
              3.2.1.5.1.1. Commanders will include an explanatory note in the remarks section
              of the FA for crewmembers that exceed the crew complement but are required for
              the mission.
           3.2.1.5.2. Non-aircrew members assigned to flying unit commander positions may
           log flying time in assigned aircraft. Individuals will fly on a non-interference basis
 76                                                   AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


           (reference paragraph 2.10.4), will use crew position ―OX‖ (Colonel and above) or
           ―XX‖ (Lt Col and below) IAW Table A2.3, and will log other time on the AFTO
           Form 781 for entry into ARMS.
           3.2.1.5.3. Non-aircrew members assigned to RPA sensor operator positions will log
           flying time in assigned RPA aircraft. Individuals will fly on a non-interference basis,
           will use aircrew position (Second Character) ―X‖ IAW Table A2.3, and will log
           AFTO Form 781 flying time category commensurate with qualification and duties
           performed for entry into ARMS.
   3.2.2. Flights in any other capacity are orientation flights IAW paragraph 1.9.4.7.1 and
   logging flight time on an AFTO Form 781 is not authorized. Commanders will ensure
   crewmembers and parachutists do not credit flights/jumps while on leave, permissive TDY,
   or nonflying/nonjumping TDY/Temporary Additional Duty (TAD), regardless of duration, or
   while flying on an aircraft during point-to-point travel (not authorized or required to perform
   aircrew duties). Aircrew members will not log flying time when the purpose for flying is to
   make a proficiency-sustaining jump or perform jumpmaster duties. EXCEPTION:
   Pararescue personnel in X-coded billets may log flying time if aircrew duties are performed
   during the flying portion of the mission. Document duties performed in the remarks section
   of the AFTO Form 781.
   3.2.3. For each individual, the total flight time logged will not exceed the total AFTO Form
   781 flight time of the aircraft.
       3.2.3.1. Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Time. RPA crews may be authorized to
       simultaneously control more than one aircraft during flight operations. The total time
       logged by each individual will reflect the total time spent controlling aircraft inflight and
       is not dependent upon the number of aircraft actually controlled. Flight time logged will
       not exceed the time the individual was performing inflight aircraft control duties. Flight
       time may be credited for Group 4 and Group 5 aircraft, as defined in Joint Publication
       (JP) 3-30, Command and Control for Joint Air Operations.
3.3. Definition of Flight Time Categories. The references in this paragraph to aircraft also
apply to synthetic training devices categorized as operational flying trainers or weapon system
trainers. Log flight time only on the AFTO Form 781 and AF Form 3520, ARMS
Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract, and use only the approved Flight Authorization Duty
Codes listed in Attachment 2, Table A2.3
3.3. (AFGSC)Definition of Flight Time Categories. During an initial or re-qualification
instructor flight evaluation, the instructor candidate will log time in the crew position in which he
or she is currently qualified.
   3.3.1. Primary Flight Time. Time logged by a member occupying a designated duty
   station identified in AFI 65-503, and actively performing the duty associated with their
   aircrew specialty. Only qualified aircrew members and aircrew members obtaining
   qualification in the aircraft will log primary time when performing in-flight duties. Non-
   rated/non-CEA aircrew members and operational support personnel who do not have an
   established crew duty station will log primary time only when actually performing required
   in-flight duty. For example: operating equipment or caring for medical evacuation patients.
       3.3.1.1. EXCEPTIONS:
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                            77


        3.3.1.1.1. Pilot commanders and key supervisors who fly IAW the provisions of
        paragraph 3.6.1 will log primary time only when actually controlling the aircraft.
        3.3.1.1.1. (AFGSC) Indoctrination Flyers will not act as pilot in command, and will
        log only ―Other‖ time on the AFTO Form 781.
        3.3.1.1.2. Pilots who maintain qualification in single-place aircraft when completing
        instrument training or the instrument flight check in similar dual-place aircraft.
        3.3.1.1.3. Graduates of a military test pilot school (Air Force Test Pilot School, Navy
        Test Pilot School, etc.) are considered qualified and may log primary flight time using
        FP, FN, or FW as the flight authorization duty code while actively flying qualitative
        or approved short-term aircraft tests or evaluations. This does not authorize Test Pilot
        School graduates to perform duties on other missions requiring qualified aircrew
        members at the controls of the aircraft (e.g. functional check flights).
        3.3.1.1.4. Pararescue/Combat Rescue Officer aircrew members assigned to
        authorized flying billets, on active flying AOs and qualified in the MDS, who are
        required in addition to the normal aircrew complement to perform in-flight duties for
        mass rescued aircrew member/personnel missions may log primary flight time when
        performing patient support duties on mass personnel recovery missions. Primary time
        is authorized only during the time required in-flight duties are performed. During
        periods when the PJ is not performing in-flight duties associated with the rescued
        members, or if the PJ is non-current for that MDS, ―Other‖ flight time will be logged.
        Annotate specific inflight duties that require additional crewmembers (in additional to
        basic crew complement) on the mission in the remarks section of the AFTO Form
        781.
        3.3.1.1.5. Operational support medical personnel may log primary time when tasked
        to perform primary medical support duties on real world Combat Search and Rescue
        (CSAR), Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) or Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC)
        missions. If tasked to fly on non-US Air Force missions, ensure requests are
        coordinated though the member‘s MAJCOM IAW paragraph 1.11.1 of this
        instruction.
        3.3.1.1.6. Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmembers (AECM) on Aeromedical
        Readiness Missions (ARM) are authorized to conduct simultaneous (tandem) training
        on the same aircraft utilizing no more than two basic AE crews to meet flight
        currency requirements. AECMs in primary crew positions will log primary time when
        performing in-flight duties. Example: Two basic AE crews conducting separate in-
        flight training using separate in-flight kits, medical equipment, and mission
        documentation. A lead crew will be identified to the flight crew prior to take off for
        CRM purposes.
     3.3.1.2. For pilots, primary time is time actively controlling the aircraft, excluding
     hands-on-time flown while instructing and evaluating (log such time under instructor or
     evaluator). It is not predicated on which set of controls is being used (multi-place
     aircraft), or on the duty position indicated on the flight authorization. Pilots receiving
     instruction while controlling the aircraft will log primary time.
78                                                 AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


     3.3.1.3. Astronauts performing duties in the space shuttle may log primary time in their
     rated specialty in accordance with the preceding paragraphs. Astronauts performing space
     station duties may log primary time for the duration of space station activity. For space
     station duty, use Aircrew Position Identifier (Second Character) ―A‖ from Attachment 2,
     Table A2.3
     3.3.1.4. For other aircrew specialties, log primary flight time only when performing
     duties at a duty position established for that specialty. Where more than one station is
     established for the same specialty, one member at each such station may log primary time
     while actually performing the duties associated with that station (for example, multiple
     Air Surveillance Operator positions on a single aircraft). (MAJCOMs will specify which
     AFI 65-503-authorized crew duty station(s) flight test engineers may occupy during test
     functions. During periods when the flight test engineer is not actively performing his or
     her evaluation/test duties, Other time will be logged.) Except under conditions in this
     paragraph, the total primary time for any specific aircrew specialty will not exceed the
     total flight time. Note: Due to the broad nature of flight surgeon duties, each position
     which another aircrew member occupies (as defined in AFPD 11-4, e.g., pilot, navigator,
     ABM, observer, CEA personnel), may be considered as a flight surgeon station/position
     (i.e., a KC-135 with a pilot, copilot, and boom operator would be authorized three flight
     surgeon stations). If there are more flight surgeons onboard than aircrew stations, the
     total primary time must be split between those flight surgeons onboard by logging
     primary and other time. When the number of flight surgeons on board is less or equal to
     the number of occupied aircrew stations, all flight surgeons are authorized to log primary
     time for the entire mission.
        3.3.1.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) Security Forces personnel, required for the mission and
        actively performing Tactical Response Force Duties (TRF) will log ―primary‖ time.
        When not performing TRF duties or while aircrews are performing
        proficiency/continuation training, TRF personnel will log ―other‖ time. The AFTO
        Form 781 will be broken out to reflect changes in mission symbols any time aircrew
        training is conducted. If more than four TRF members are on the aircraft, duties may
        be split between personnel. However, no more than four TRF members may log
        primary time at any one time. When adhering to the above conditions; ―primary‖ time
        logged by TRF members will not exceed total ―primary‖ time logged by four
        individuals conducting primary TRF duties. When not actively performing TRF
        duties, ―other‖ time will be logged. EXCEPTION: During ―real-world‖ security
        incidents (i.e. actual sabotage, infiltration, or terrorist attack on a convoy or Missile
        Alert Facility), the total number of TRF personnel logging ―primary‖ time may
        exceed four individuals. The TRF Team Lead will determine the total number of TRF
        personnel needed on the mission to protect Protection Level 1 Assets.
        3.3.1.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) On UH-1N missions requiring a scanner (IAW AFI 11-
        2UH-1N Vol 3), if a flight engineer occupies the scanner position, they will log
        secondary time. Pilots will log other time.
     3.3.1.5. Nonrated aircrew members on active flying AOs, qualified in specific aircraft,
     but tasked to perform in-flight aircrew duties for a time-sensitive mission in an aircraft in
     which they are not current and/or not qualified, will log aircrew certification code (first
     character of crew position) ―F‖ and primary time for that mission. See also paragraph
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                             79


     3.2.1.5.2 Note: Utilization of non-current and/or unqualified personnel is an exception to
     established policy. Every effort must be made to obtain current and qualified personnel to
     perform aircrew duties prior to utilizing non-current and/or unqualified personnel.
  3.3.2. Secondary Flight Time. Flight time logged by a crewmember who is performing
  inflight duties related to the crewmember‘s specialty, but who is not controlling the function
  of that specialty. Except as listed below, the total secondary time logged in each specialty
  will not exceed the total flight time. When crewmembers are in excess of the authorized crew
  complement, annotate in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781 the secondary duties performed
  by additional aircrew.
     3.3.2.1. The member must be maintaining or obtaining qualification in the aircraft to log
     secondary time. EXCEPTION: Crewmembers in aircrew positions designated in AFI 65-
     503; and tasked to perform primary duties on aircraft other than their assigned aircraft
     (e.g., Flight Attendants tasked by TACC or HHQ to support Silver Bullet or DV
     missions) will log secondary time as long as they maintain currency in their primary
     aircraft. The member‘s aircrew certification code will reflect the current qualification. If
     not qualified in the aircraft, the member will log ―X‖ or ―O‖ as the aircrew qualification
     code first character IAW Table A2.3
     3.3.2.2. For pilots, log secondary time while occupying a duty position having a set of
     flight controls and not actively controlling the aircraft, instructing, or evaluating.
     3.3.2.3. For other aircrew specialties, log secondary time when actually performing
     inflight duties of the specialty, but not at the primary duty station established for that
     specialty (for example, second navigator during airdrop missions or additional PJs/CROs
     on AOs required to perform ―in-flight duties‖ assisting mass aircrew/personnel on a
     rescue mission) when dictated by mission requirements.
         3.3.2.3.1. Annotate in the remarks section of the AFTO Form 781 specific inflight
         duties performed and circumstances that require additional crewmembers (in
         additional to basic crew complement) to perform the mission.
     3.3.2.4. A current Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmember (AECM) may log secondary
     time when performing simulated patient duties or Mission Clinical Coordinator duties
     during aeromedical readiness missions. A noncurrent AECM may only log Other flight
     time when performing simulated patient duties.
     3.3.2.5. Except as provided for in AFI 65-503, the total secondary time logged in each
     specialty will not exceed the total flight time.
     3.3.2.6. Pararescue aircrew members assigned to authorized flying billets, on active
     flying AOs and qualified in the MDS, who are required in addition to the normal aircrew
     complement to perform in-flight duties for mass rescued aircrew member/personnel
     missions, may log secondary time when performing simulated patient duties or Mission
     Coordinator duties on mass personnel recovery training missions. Secondary time is
     authorized only during such time those in-flight duties are performed. During periods
     when the PJ is not performing ―in-flight‖ duties associated with the rescued members or
     mission coordinator, or non-current for that MDS, only Other flight time will be logged.
80                                                  AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


  3.3.3. Instructor Flight Time. Flight time logged by a designated and qualified instructor
  while actively performing authorized instructional duties. Includes ―hands on‖ time during
  demonstration activities that are part of instructional duties. The instructor is not required to
  occupying a primary duty station established for that specialty, but must be actually
  performing instructor duties. Except as provided for in this section, members must be
  qualified and current in the aircraft to log instructor time. Except as provided for in AFI 65-
  503 and paragraph 3.3.3.1, the total instructor flight time for each aircrew specialty will not
  exceed the total flight time.
  3.3.3. (AFGSC) When two current and qualified instructor pilots are together on a
  mission/flight, instructor time can only be logged if specific instruction is called for in the
  mission profile and the instructor is so designated on the flight authorization. Even if
  designated as an Instructor on the flight authorization, the Instructor will use ―M‖ as the first
  character of their crew position and log primary time if Instructor duties were not performed
  on the flight. Place a remark on the flight authorization explaining that no instruction was
  given during the flight.
     3.3.3.1. Instructors may log instructor time while accomplishing unlike specialty training
     instruction (e.g., an instructor navigator training pilots/boom operators for a three-person
     crew or third pilots in the navigator seat). Only the amount of time used to train a specific
     event may be logged as instructor time. If more than one instructor of like specialty are
     on the aircraft to provide simultaneous instruction for crewmembers of different
     specialties, both instructors may log instructor time (e.g., two instructor navigators are on
     the same aircraft, one is instructing a student navigator and the other is instructing a
     boom operator). In this case, total instructor time logged may exceed total flight time
     logged. Enter a remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781 explaining the rationale for
     logging excess instructor time.
     3.3.3.2. Two instructors (to include FTU) of the same specialty may fly together and
     each log instructor time; however, total instructor time logged may not exceed total flight
     time logged. (e.g., A new FTU instructor is flying with a student crew and a more
     experienced FTU instructor flies with the new FTU instructor; instruction can occur
     between the new FTU instructor and student or between the experienced FTU instructor
     and new instructor, but not both simultaneously. Therefore, the total instructor time
     logged may not exceed total flight time.).
     3.3.3.3. Aircrew members who are instructor qualified in one aircraft, and who are
     current and qualified (but not qualified as an instructor) in another aircraft, may log
     instructor time while flying in the second aircraft and providing instruction to an aircrew
     member in the first aircraft. This applies to instructors in single seat aircraft who are also
     qualified in chase aircraft, but who do not maintain instructor qualification in the chase
     aircraft. Instructor time may be logged only while actively providing instruction. Enter a
     remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781 to explain the rationale for logging instructor
     time in the chase aircraft (this paragraph may be cited as a reference).
     3.3.3.4. Instructors will log primary, secondary, or other time, depending on their
     activity, when not performing instructor duties.
     3.3.3.5. Log simulator console time as instructor time when the crewmember is qualified
     as an instructor in the aircraft. When MAJCOMs authorize crewmembers to be
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                            81


     instructors in the simulator only, they may log simulator console time as instructor time.
     MAJCOMs will determine which types of simulators qualify for this approval, e.g.,
     operational flight trainers, weapon system trainers, etc.
     3.3.3.5. (AFGSC) UH-1N crew members may log simulator time in either a UH-1N or
     Bell 212 aircrew training device.
  3.3.4. Evaluator Flight Time. Flight time flown by a designated and certified flight
  evaluator while actively performing authorized flight evaluation duties. Includes ―hands on‖
  time if coincident with performance of flight evaluator duties. The member is not required to
  occupy a primary duty station established for that specialty, but must be actually performing
  evaluator duties. Evaluators will also log instructor, primary, secondary, or other time,
  depending on their activity, when not performing evaluator duties. Note: Members must be
  current and certified in the aircraft to log evaluator time. When flight evaluators conduct
  flight evaluations onboard aircraft in which they are not qualified, then members must log
  ―O‖ or ―X‖ as the aircrew qualification code first character IAW Table A2.3
  3.3.4. (AFGSC) Evaluator Flight Time. Active AFGSC/NAF evaluators will log ‟X‖ or
  ‟O‖ (―O‖ for Colonels and above and ―X‖ for Lt Col and below) duty position on the AFTO
  Form 781, and will log other time when conducting evaluations in aircraft they are not
  qualified/authorized to fly, (IAW AFI 11-202V2, 4.3.4 and 4.3.8). "Other" flight time is not
  creditable toward OFDA or incentive pay requirements.
     3.3.4.1. Aircrew members who are designated and certified as a flight evaluator in one
     aircraft, and who are current and qualified (but not certified as a flight evaluator) in
     another aircraft, may log evaluator time while flying in the second aircraft and evaluating
     an aircrew member in the first aircraft. This applies to flight evaluators in single seat
     aircraft who are also qualified in chase aircraft, but who are not certified as a flight
     evaluator in the chase aircraft. Enter a remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781 to
     explain the rationale for logging evaluator time in the chase paragraph (this paragraph
     may be cited as a reference).
  3.3.5. Other Flight Time. Flight time flown by members who are on the flight
  authorization, but who are not occupying a designated duty station or conforming to the
  requirements of primary, secondary, instructor, or evaluator time. For example: additional or
  extra crewmembers taking part in the flight, required for the mission to augment the crew or
  perform mission-related observation or evaluator duties (not qualified in the aircraft).
  Indoctrination fliers log other time. Crewmembers will log other time during periods of crew
  rest or sleep.
  3.3.6. Combat and Combat Support Flight Time.
     3.3.6.1. Combat. Aerial activity, engagements, or attacks conducted by aircraft against
     an enemy of the US or an opposing foreign force when there is risk of exposure to hostile
     fire. Aerial activity in support of forces engaged in combat when there is risk of exposure
     to hostile fire. Combat includes both elements: activity against an enemy or opposing
     force (or activity supporting forces engaging an enemy or opposing force) and risk of
     exposure to hostile fire.
         3.3.6.1.1. As soon as possible after a combat zone is established, the Commander Air
         Force Forces (COMAFFOR) will identify which portion constitutes hostile airspace.
 82                                                 AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


          Hostile airspace is airspace within a combat zone that has been specifically
          designated as hostile airspace by the COMAFFOR, based on risk of exposure to
          hostile fire. The combat zone may contain areas that are not designated as hostile
          airspace. For the purposes of logging combat time the aerial activity must be
          accomplished in a designated combat zone within the designated hostile airspace.
          Flight within the combat zone but outside of the designated area or areas of hostile
          airspace does not qualify as combat time, since there is no risk of exposure to hostile
          fire. (EXCEPTION: In cases of aircrews that employ standoff weapons, the
          COMAFFOR under extraordinary circumstances may permit those aircrews to log
          combat time outside of the hostile airspace and/or outside of the designated combat
          zone. If an exception is granted, include the exception in the guidance designating the
          combat zone and the hostile airspace.) COMAFFOR will publish guidelines
          specifying which aircraft missions may log combat/combat support flight time and
          will identify the inclusive dates that the hostile airspace is activated for logging
          combat time. During contingencies when a combat zone is not designated but the use
          of force is authorized, COMAFFOR will coordinate with AF/A3/5 to establish hostile
          airspace criteria and guidelines for logging combat/combat support flight time. Note:
          COMAFFOR will issue new guidance and procedures every two years to ensure all
          Air Force units are aware of the current policy.
       3.3.6.2. Combat Support. Aerial activity, engagements, or attacks conducted by aircraft
       against an enemy of the US or an opposing foreign force that operate outside the
       designated hostile airspace, where there is no risk of exposure to hostile fire. Includes
       aerial activity directly supporting forces engaged in combat or directly supporting those
       who are actively supporting combat when the aerial activity occurs outside the designated
       hostile airspace. Hostile airspace is determined as described above under combat time.
       3.3.6.3. Combat or combat support time will be logged from takeoff to landing when an
       individual: (1) meets the requirements of combat/combat support flight time, (2) is on an
       AO that requires the member to fly, (3) is listed on the flight authorization authorized to
       perform in-flight aircrew duties and, (4) is required for the mission IAW paragraph
       3.2.1.5 of this instruction. Additionally, eligible members authorized to fly IAW
       paragraph 3.6.1 may log combat or combat support time. Do not combine mission
       symbols; use one symbol for the entire flight.
3.4. Flight Condition Time. The categories listed in paragraph 3.3 are the basis for
accumulating flying experience for all flying personnel. Record all flying time accrued on a
mission in the appropriate category. Provisions have been made to record, for historical
purposes, a breakout of flight time by flight condition: night, instrument, and simulated
instrument. Primary time flown in more than one condition simultaneously (for example, night
and instrument) would result in entries under both of these categories on the form. The type of
time logged will be consistent with the flight condition actually encountered or procedure
accomplished. MAJCOMs may further restrict logging combinations that are inconsistent with
command policy or procedures. Use the following guidance for logging flight condition time:
   3.4.1. Night Time. The portion of primary, secondary, instructor, or evaluator flight time
   logged between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight,
   as published in the American Air Almanac. (EXCEPTION: An evaluator will log night time
   as a flight condition in conjunction with ―Other‖ flight time when performing evaluation
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                             83


   duties onboard aircraft in which he or she does not maintain qualification.) For personnel
   assigned at latitudes above 60 degrees north (May through August) or below 60 degrees
   south (November through February), night requirements are waived when removal from
   active flying or PCS occurs during the summer months. May be logged in a flight simulator
   when operating in simulated night conditions.
   3.4.2. Night Vision Goggle Time. The portion of flight time logged by an aircrew member
   wearing night vision goggles between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of
   morning civil twilight, as published in the American Air Almanac. Crewmembers performing
   aircrew duties in a crew position with NVG training requirements will log this time while
   wearing NVGs. NVG time may also be logged by flight surgeons and aircrew members
   instructing or evaluating individuals who are performing crew duties where NVGs are
   required and worn. NVG time will not exceed total night time logged. NVG time may be
   logged in a flight simulator if the simulator is accredited for NVG training (simulator model
   and simulator software).
   3.4.3. Primary Instrument Time. The portion of primary, instructor, or evaluator flight
   time logged when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude be maintained
   primarily by reference to the flight instruments. Pilots only will log this time when
   performing duties in this flight condition. Note: To log primary instrument time in the
   aircraft, an instructor or evaluator pilot must occupy a duty station with a set of flight
   controls, but does not have to actively (hands-on) control the aircraft. An accredited flight
   simulator or flight training device may be used by a pilot to log instrument time, provided an
   authorized instructor is present during the simulated flight. Simulators are accredited for
   logging instrument time according to AFI 36-2251, Management of Air Force Training
   Systems.
   3.4.4. Primary Simulated Instrument Time. The portion of primary, ―hands-on‖
   instructor, or ―hands-on‖ evaluator time logged by an individual controlling the aircraft
   attitude primarily by reference to the flight instruments. Pilots only will log this time when
   performing duties in this flight condition. May be logged in a flight simulator.
3.5. Non-rated/non-CEA Flight Time. Non-rated/non-CEA aircrew members will log flying
time using the proper flight authorization duty code. Log time only when authorized on AOs and
when actively performing specific inflight duties as designated by flight authorization orders
(paragraph 3.8). Aeromedical evacuation crewmembers log time only when listed on the flight
authorization and actively engaged in operational air evacuation or air rescue missions;
aeromedical research and development inflight; or air evacuation training missions that require
AECMs in a crew position, being instructed, being evaluated, or as listed in paragraph 3.3.2.4
above.

Section 3B—Logging of Flight Activity (General)

3.6. Logging Flight Time for Pay. Credit only flight time logged according to paragraph 3.2
toward incentive pay requirements. Flight time flown in ―O‖ or ―X‖ status does not entitle the
member to OFDA credit, ACIP or HDIP. Note: See Attachment 2, Table A2.3 EXCEPTION:
Air Technicians (AT) and Air Reserve Technicians (ART) must be in military status to log time
for incentive pay. This Air Force Instruction and MAJCOMs define the inflight duties that
qualify individuals for ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP.
 84                                                  AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


   3.6.1. Logging Flight Time by Rated Officers and CEAs Who are Qualified in One
   Aircraft and Not Other Types of Aircraft Assigned to Their Units. MAJCOMS and
   equivalent organizations, and subordinate organizations, may authorize commanders
   (including unit commanders) and key supervisors (API 6, 8, B, or D) who are qualified and
   maintain currency in one type aircraft, but have other types assigned to their units, to fly in a
   primary crew position in assigned aircraft in which they are not qualified. Individuals will be
   under the supervision of an instructor for the applicable crew position. The crewmember will
   log an ―O‖ or ―X‖ as the aircrew qualification code first character and his or her assigned
   second character crew position code IAW Table A2.3 (As noted above, flight time flown in
   ―O‖ or ―X‖ status does not entitle the member to OFDA credit, ACIP or HDIP.) See also
   paragraph 3.3.1.1.1 Members who fly IAW this paragraph will log all applicable flight time,
   to include combat or combat support time (see paragraph 3.3.6.3). Members will comply
   with minimum requirements in AFI 11-202 Vol 1 and in the MDS-Specific Vol 1 for aircraft
   in which they log flight time. (EXCEPTION: Form 8/8a qualification and flight event
   currency are not required in additional aircraft, unless members maintain multiple
   qualification.) Note: Pilots who fly under the provisions of this paragraph may fly in the seat
   with MEP on board the aircraft. See also paragraph 1.12.4.2.
3.7. Logging Flight Time by Rated Officers and Career Enlisted Aviators in Inactive
Flying Status. Personnel in such status do not log flying time in their specialty in US
Government aircraft except as provided in FAC waivers listed in Table 2.2, paragraphs 2.7.2.2.,
2.8.1.1., and 2.14 In all such cases, inactive crewmembers must maintain physical and
physiological qualification (if applicable) for aviation service.
3.8. Non-rated/non-CEA Crewmembers and Operational Support Flight Time. Inflight
duties authorized by Air Force and MAJCOM instructions determine the proper flying duty or
position symbol for logging flight time on AFTO Form 781. This flying time is accomplished
when actively performing inflight duties as follows:
   3.8.1. Non-rated/non-CEA Crewmember Duty. When on AOs and properly assigned to
   an authorized non-rated/non-CEA aircrew position as part of the regularly constituted crew
   IAW AFIs 11-401, 11-402, and 65-503, and:
       3.8.1.1. The individual‘s primary duty requires the performance of inflight duties on a
       frequent and regular basis.
       3.8.1.2. The approved inflight duties are essential to operating aircraft systems and
       associated equipment required for mission accomplishment.
   3.8.2. Operational Support (Non-crewmember) Duty. Members are placed on AOs for a
   specified time and must be properly authorized to perform inflight duties not prescribed in
   AFI 65-503 and to supplement a regularly constituted aircrew. They are on flight status for
   limited periods to perform essential and specific in-flight duties that cannot be accomplished
   by authorized aircrew personnel. Refer to AFI 11-402 for guidance.
3.9. Logging Flight Time in Non-US Air Force Aircraft. Only members performing inflight
duties authorized by paragraph 1.11 may log flying time in non-US Air Force aircraft for credit
towards OFDA requirements or incentive pay. Otherwise only ―Other‖ flight time will be
credited in an individual‘s flight records.
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                              85


3.10. Logging Other US Military Time. Total career flight time obtained in the service of
other US military agencies when not officially directed by the Air Force, and when verified by
logbook or other official records certified by authorized persons. This time will be entered into
ARMS in the Other US Military hour block. Time obtained in other US military aircraft is not
included in this category if performed in an official capacity (e.g., directed by competent Air
Force order); such time is recorded as Air Force rated time. Note: Inter-service transfers who
previously participated in an Air Force aviation exchange program may have their time separated
by Air Force MDS. This time will be subtracted from the total Other US Military flying time.
3.11. Logging Student Time. Total career flight time acquired by rated trainees in USAF or
USAF-directed undergraduate flight training prior to attaining a rating. This time will be entered
into ARMS in the student time hour block. Note: Interservice transfers who previously
participated in an Air Force aviation exchange program may have their time separated by Air
Force MDS. Example: Capt Schaffer, an interservice transfer, flew 350 hours in the F-16 during
his Naval career under an approved Air Force exchange program. Capt Schaffer‘s flight time
may be logged under the MDS F-16 in ARMS. This time will be subtracted from the total Other
US Military flying time.
3.12. Logging Foreign Military Time. Total career flight time obtained in the service of other
governments when not officially directed by the Air Force, and when verified by logbook or
other official record certified by authorized persons. This time will be entered into ARMS in the
Foreign Military hour block.
3.13. Logging Flight Time in Other Than Military Aircraft. Flight time logged according to
paragraph 3.2 in other than military aircraft is credited toward annual flying requirements only
when directed by competent Air Force AOs and such flying is inherent in the primary duty
assignment of the person concerned. Aircrews must document flight time on an AFTO Form 781
or AF Form 3250 and, except for CAP-USAF or Introductory Flying Training missions, be in
aircraft with 450 or more rated horsepower.
3.14. Logging Civilian Flight Time. Total career flight time acquired in civilian aircraft of 450
or more rated horsepower, when verified by logbook or other official record certified by
authorized persons. (These authorized persons are operations officers of military aviation
activities; suitable agents of commercial aviation companies; operating managers of fields from
which the reported flying was performed, if in privately owned aircraft; and officials of
recognized civil flight schools.) This time will be entered into ARMS in the civilian hour block.
3.15. Quarterly General Officer Flying Hour Information Report. MAJCOMs will submit
Quarterly GO Flying Hour Information Report (RCS: HAF-A3O[Q]0702) via message to HQ
USAF/A3O-AT by the 15th of the month following each calendar quarter. This report is
designated emergency status code C-3. Submit data requirements as prescribed, but they may be
delayed to allow the submission of higher precedence reports. Continue reporting during
emergency conditions, delayed precedence. Discontinue reporting during MINIMIZE. Provide
data for operational fliers. As directed by AF/A3O-AT, provide data for indoctrination fliers. The
report will include the following:
3.15. (AFGSC)Quarterly General Officer Flying Hour Information Report. The General
Officer (GO) Flying Hour Report is due to HQ AFGSC/A3TA not later than the 10th calendar
day of the first month following the end of a calendar quarter (Apr, Jul, Oct, Jan). Electronic
transmission of the report is the preferred method. If the 10th calendar day falls on a weekend or

prefixed Air Force Specialty Code) personnel responsible for the safe ground and flight
operation of the aircraft and onboard systems, or for airborne duties essential to accomplishment
of the aircraft‗s mission. Includes members in initial formal training for immediate assignment to
an authorized operational flying position. Individuals must be on AOs and assigned to an
authorized position according to AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, or
nonrated aircrew not in an aircraft‘s basic crew complement, but required for the mission.
Aircrew members perform their principal duties inflight and their presence is required for the
aircraft to accomplish its primary tasked mission. Duties must be essential to operating the
aircraft or mission systems and equipment used for completing a mission, or other duties
essential to the aircraft‘s mission. Note: As used in the publication, the term ―navigator‖
includes all navigator specialties and is synonymous with the designation Combat Systems
Officer (CSO). New UFT graduates are designated CSOs, but previously qualified individuals
will continue to be identified as navigators.
Air Force Aircraft—US Government aircraft under US Air Force jurisdiction.
Airmanship Programs (USAFA)—Any USAF Academy course listed in the catalog and
administered by the 306 FTG at the Academy airfield or deployed location.
Authentication—The process that makes an administrative order official. Evidenced by proper
signature or seal that a document is genuine and official. The only seal authorized on AOs is on
Department of the Air Force (DAF) orders (For example: A DAF order that awards a pilot
rating).
Authorized Aircrews—Aircrews authorized according to AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and
Planning Factors, Attachment A36-1 (Authorized Aircrew Composition Active Forces),

as authorized in the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the Aviation Career Improvement
Act of 1989, and the FY 96 National Defense Authorization Act.
Aviation Service Date (ASD)—Effective date of the first AO to perform flight duties. For rated
officers, this date is set when the member first reports to the aviation activity that has aircraft in
which he or she will receive flight training leading to an aeronautical rating and is placed on AOs
(for example, class start date of SUPT, SUNT, UPT-H class, or Weapons Systems Training) or
date of commission, whichever is later. For flight surgeons, the ASD equals the date all
requirements for the flight surgeon rating were met, which is normally the date Course
50BY9351 or equivalent was completed. (EXCEPTION: The ASD for medical students who
have completed Course 50BY9351 will be the date post graduate medical training is completed,
an unrestricted medical license is attained, AFSC 48XX is awarded, and the flight surgeon rating
is assigned. All requirements must be accomplished for award of the ASD.) For Air Battle
Managers, the ASD is the date the crewmember enters formal ABM flying training (class start
date). For career enlisted aviators, the ASD is set when the member first reports to the aviation
activity that has aircraft in which he or she will receive flight training leading to career enlisted
aviator status and is placed on AOs. Rated ASDs and CEA ASDs are established separately. See
also AFI 11-402.

Air Force (IAW AFI 10-2701).
Commander—When used in this instruction, ―commander‖ refers to a wing commander (or
comparable level), or any level higher within the chain of command, of a flying unit to which an
individual is assigned or attached for flying. If an individual is geographically separated from the
wing, authority may be delegated to a group or squadron level.
Conditional Entitlement—The condition under which rated officers and career enlisted aviators
in an aviation career are entitled to receive ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP, conditional to meeting
minimum monthly flying time standards IAW DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A; and AFI 11-421.
Continuation Training—The continuation training program provides crew members with the
volume, frequency, and mix of training (flying and ground training) necessary to maintain
proficiency in the assigned qualification level. This training must be recorded in the ARMS
database.
Continuous Entitlement—The condition under which rated officers and career enlisted aviators
in an aviation career are entitled to receive ACIP or CEFIP without regard to flight activity.
Flight—For the purpose of this instruction only, a flight is synonymous with a mission.
Flight Authorization (FA)—A single document used to identify all aircrew, operational
support, and authorized non-interference members on AOs, who are qualified and required to
perform duties on specific aircraft for a scheduled mission. MEP may be placed on the flight
authorization, only in the Remarks section. AE/PJ FAs are attached to the aircraft FA for the
mission(s) on which they performed duties.
Form—Term used to identify Air Force forms and IMTs (Information Management Tools).
IAW AFI 33-360, the IMT designator is being phased out; it is not used in this publication.
Frequent and Regular—―Frequent and regular‖ is a DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Chapter 22,
term which establishes the minimum monthly flight requirements to be entitled to conditional
Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted Flight Incentive Pay (CEFIP), or
Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP). DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, sets the minimum at four
hours for active duty (Chapter 22) and two hours for Air Reserve Components (ARC) per
calendar month (Chapter 58), or a prorated share for lesser periods. By itself, the requirement to
fly frequently and regularly is not justification to assign an individual to aircrew or operational
support flier status. There must be a need to perform inflight duties.
Government Aircraft—An aircraft owned, operated, or leased by the US Government.
Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP)—Incentive pay authorized for personnel required to
perform flight duties on a frequent and regular basis.

Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) Office—The office responsible for ARMS,
flight record, and jump record management. The HARM office determines entitlement to ACIP,
CEFIP, and HDIP.
Host Aviation Resource Manager—The sole approval authority (except for AF/A3O-AT) at
each flying base for determining entitlement and the starting and stopping of ACIP, CEFIP, and
HDIP for flying and parachute duties; responsible for interpreting public law as it pertains to
entitlement to these incentive pays along with auditing and reconciliation of these incentive pays;
and the single point of contact for ARMS. This position is inherently governmental.
Instrument Flight—Flight conducted when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude
be maintained primarily by reference to the flight instruments.
Intent—For the purpose of publishing an AO, the intent of an AO is to validate individual
qualification for aviation and/or parachutist service, authorize and direct frequent and regular
participation in aerial flight or parachute duties; and establish or terminate individual entitlement
to ACIP, CEFIP, and HDIP. Intent also includes the effective date of the AO.
Interfly—The exchange and/or substitution of aircrews and aircraft between MAJCOMs.
Mission—For the purpose of this instruction only, mission is defined as a primary objective for
which an aircraft is operated (see Mission Symbols) and which may consist of an increment of
one or more sorties. Several missions may be accomplished in one sortie.
Mission Essential Personnel (MEP)—personnel who are required for the execution of the
aircraft or unit mission, to include follow-on missions. Includes additional aircrew members
required for follow-on missions (may be further defined in MAJCOM supplements to this
instruction) and personnel not authorized AOs who are tasked to perform ground support duties
at enroute locations or destination points that are directly related and essential to accomplishment
of the aircraft or unit mission, e.g. a specialist or technician required to provide aircraft support
or a security team required to guard the aircraft. MEP may include military staff personnel; U.S.
Government employees; government contract employees (IAW the terms and conditions of a
current government contract); and foreign military, civilian, and contract employees (IAW the
terms and conditions of a current government contract); when those individuals are required for
the mission. Flights involving foreign nationals must be reviewed for foreign disclosure
requirements and political concerns, to include compliance with AFI 16-201, and must include
SAF/IA regional division coordination. MAJCOMs may further define MEP in supplements to
this instruction but guidance may not be less restrictive than the guidance contained herein. The
OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the aircraft grants MEP status.
(EXCEPTIONS: For AMC missions already in the system, the TACC Senior Controller may
approve MEP status. MAJCOM Standardization/Evaluation Chiefs may approve MEP status for
MAJCOM or MAJCOM-gained missions for evaluators assigned to the MAJCOM.) If
operational control transfers, the OG/CC (or equivalent) who assumes follow-on operational
control may continue/revise MEP status (coordinate changes with originating authority).
MAJCOMs may establish intra-command and inter-command guidance to facilitate this process.
MEP, to include additional crewmembers who fly in MEP status, are passengers and may only
fly in aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R.
(EXCEPTION: MEP who are mission essential may fly on aircraft not normally equipped for
carrying passengers. MEP who fly under the provisions of this exception must be physically and

physiologically [when required] qualified and must complete applicable egress training prior to
flight.)
Officer Service Date (OSD)—Effective date of service as a commissioned, warrant, or flight
officer, whether or not served on extended active duty. This is usually equivalent to total federal
commissioned service date backdated by any period served as a warrant or flight officer. For
flight surgeons, the OSD includes constructive service granted medical officers in the
computation of creditable service for basic pay.
Operational Flying—Flying performed under competent orders by rated and CEA personnel
(primarily for mission, support, or training purposes) while serving in an assignment where basic
flying skills usually are maintained for performing assigned duties.
Operational Support Flier—An individual whose primary, full-time duty does not require
flying. The Air Force may require these individuals to fly on an occasional basis to perform a
specific, essential inflight duty that cannot be performed by an assigned aircrew member. Duties
may include, but are not limited to inflight test, operation, or inflight maintenance of specific
aircraft systems or installed equipment. To receive non-crew hazardous duty pay, operational
support fliers must be placed on AOs and complete prescribed flying hour requirements.
Authorized man-months are required prior to issuance of AOs.
Orientation Flight—Continuous flights in DoD-owned aircraft performed within the local
flying area and terminating at the point of origin, conducted to reward and motivate individuals
(incentive orientation flights only), ensure a better understanding of a particular weapon system
and its role, or when the flight is determined to be in the best interest of the USAF.
Pilot In Command—The aircrew member designated by competent authority as being in
command of an aircraft and responsible for its safe operation and accomplishment of the
assigned mission.
Point-To-Point—Point-to-point means flights that takeoff from one location and land at a
different location. Point-to-point orientation flights are not authorized. EXCEPTION: Units
may accomplish orientation flights within the local flying area to operational and remote sites
that are part of the home unit, as long as the mission terminates at the point of origin. Such
flights providing unit mission orientation are not considered point-to-point flights and an
exception to policy is not required (OSD-ATL policy guidance, Feb 10).
Sortie—An AFTO Form 781 aircraft sortie begins when the aircraft begins to move forward on
takeoff or takes off vertically from rest at any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when
the aircraft returns to the surface and either of the following conditions occur: a) the engines are
stopped, or the aircraft is on the surface for five minutes, whichever occurs first; or, b) a change
is made in the crew which enplanes or deplanes a crewmember. For logging aircrew proficiency
training, on missions during which some crewmembers deplane and the remaining crew from the
original takeoff re-launch, this may be considered to be a continuation of the original aircrew
sortie. MAJCOMs may establish MDS-specific crew requirements and procedures for aircrew
continuation sorties.
Supervisory Aircrew or Staff Member—Personnel in supervisory or staff positions (API 6, 8,
B, and D) who actively fly; or in positions (API 3, 4, C, and E) that require aircrew expertise but
individuals are not required to fly.

Training Level—Assigned to individuals based on the continuation training aircrew status
(basic aircraft qualification, basic mission capable, or mission ready/combat mission ready) they
are required to maintain.
Training Period—Any training period determined by the MAJCOM or Wing in which training
requirements are performed.
Unit Commander—When used in this instruction, ―unit commander‖ refers to the squadron
commander (or comparable level) or higher level within the chain of command.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AFTO FORM 781, ARMS AIRCREW/MISSION FLIGHT
                         DATA DOCUMENT

A2.1. Purpose. The AFTO Form 781-series provides maintenance, inspection, service
configuration, and flight operations records for weapon or support systems. AFTO Form 781,
ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, is the source document for recording and
reporting operational flight or training device information for each individual authorized to take
part in a mission. This form is the primary record of both personnel and aerospace vehicle flying
hours. It is the official record to validate flight pay eligibility for rated, CEA, and other non-
rated/non-CEA officer and enlisted members required to fly. The original AFTO Form 781 must
be maintained in the HARM office that services the unit to which the aircraft is assigned. This
form is available for downloading on the e-publishing website at www.e-publishing.af.mil.
A2.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all members authorized to log flight or training device
time in an airborne duty or position for the purpose of maintaining an official Air Force Flight
Record.
A2.3. Responsibilities. The AFTO Form 781 is established by TO 00-20-1. In most cases,
maintenance personnel are responsible for distributing and collecting these forms. Completing
the AFTO Form 781 and other forms in the series is a joint responsibility of maintenance
personnel and the pilot in command.
   A2.3.1. The crew chief or alternate ensures a sufficient number of copies of AFTO Form
   781 are onboard the aircraft and completes items 2 through 5 on a sufficient number of
   copies to fulfill mission requirements. If the forms are generated in advance, the pilot in
   command will confirm with maintenance personnel the correct data for items 2 and 3. (N/A
   for RPA units.)
   A2.3.2. The pilot in command ensures the AFTO Form 781 is dated and properly completed
   to show all pertinent flight data and the flight time for all personnel authorized to take part in
   the flight. The pilot in command will initial block 40 IAW Table A2.1
   A2.3.3. The completed AFTO Form 781 must be processed in the maintenance information
   system and delivered to the SARM for ARMS updating, then provided to the HARM office.
   (N/A for RPA units.)
       A2.3.3.1. The local HARM office will provide the maintenance organization that
       services the aircraft assigned the necessary organization and location information to be
       entered in items 4 and 5 of AFTO Form 781. This ensures completed forms are sent to
       the proper SARM or HARM office for entry into ARMS. (N/A for RPA units.)
       A2.3.3.2. Ensures an aviation resource manager or designated operations representative
       audits the unit‘s AFTO Forms 781 for accuracy and eligibility and initials in item 41 of
       the form before sending it to the HARM office. Where local procedures establish the
       HARM office as the auditing agency, the responsible individual from that office initials
       the form in item 41.
       A2.3.3.3. The original AFTO Form 781 must be provided to the HARM office that
       services the unit to which the aircraft is assigned no later than 5 days after the end of the
 98                                                      AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


           month in which the flights were performed. For example, the Form 781 for a flight flown
           in March must be turned in to the servicing HARM office NLT 5 April. EXCEPTION:
           ARC units that track/maintain ACIP and CEFIP entitlement information may forward the
           AFTO Forms 781 to the servicing HARM office not later than the first day following two
           months after the month in which the flight was performed. In the preceding example, the
           forms would not be required to be turned into the HARM office until 1 June.
              A2.3.3.3.1. SARM offices will not maintain duplicate copies of AFTO Forms 781
              (including extracts). If changes are required after the flight information has been
              entered in ARMS and the form is at the HARM office, the pilot in command must
              contact the HARM office to make corrections.
           A2.3.3.4. RPA units will maintain the original AFTO Form 781 in the HARM office of
           the unit designated to perform to the mission.

AFTO FORM 781 ENTRIES (CERTIFIED BY THE PILOT IN COMMAND)
      1        Date. Use the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) date in the following ARMS
               compatible format: (Example) 22 Sep 2010.
      6        The flight sequence of each particular leg of the flight.
      7        Mission number assigned for this leg of the mission (MAJCOM option).
      8        Authorized mission symbol for each flight. Aircrew may enter all flights on the
               same GMT date on a single AFTO Form 781.
      9        International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code for the base or airport where
               the aircraft takes off. If a flight is continued from a previous entry, enter ―INFL.‖
               Use ―XXXX‖ for classified locations or locations without an official ICAO identifier
               (i.e. a CV-22 landing in a field).
      10       Base ICAO code for the base or airport where the aircraft lands. If a flight is
               terminated without landing for a change in mission symbol, enter ―INFL.‖ Use
               ―XXXX‖ for classified locations or locations without an official ICAO identifier.
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                           99


   11     24-hour GMT clock time. The takeoff time is when the aircraft begins to move
          forward on takeoff roll.
   12     24-hour GMT clock time. The landing is when the aircraft is on the ground after
          being airborne and any of the following conditions occur: (a) The engines are
          stopped and shutdown occurs at or before five minutes after touchdown. (b) The
          aircraft has been on the ground for five minutes after touchdown; however, a series
          of practice landings is considered one flight. (c) A change is made in the crew where
          a crewmember enplanes or deplanes. Note: When a flight starts before 2400 GMT
          and ends after GMT midnight (2400Z), record and report the flight on the date of
          takeoff. A separate AFTO Form 781 is not necessary.
   13     Subtract takeoff time from landing time. Use the conversion table to the right to
          convert to hours and tenths, and enter the result.
   14     Number of touch-and-go, full stop, and total landings.
   15     Number of sorties accomplished. A sortie covers a flight from first take off to
          landing as described in block 12; however, if any flight entry is split (INFL), the
          sortie will be recorded on the flight that lists final landing.
   16     Special use as specified by MAJCOM.
   17     Flight authorization number generated in the SARM as specified in AFI 11-421.
          (MAJCOM option.)
   18     Unit issuing the flight authorization and designated to perform this mission will be
          annotated using the four-digit unit number. Use leading zeros when the unit number
          has fewer than four digits (0179AW).
TOTALS Sum of flight sequences ―a‖ through ―f‖ for total flight time, landings, and sorties at
       the end of the mission.
   19     Four-digit unit number to which the crewmember is assigned/attached for flying
          purposes. Use leading zeros when the unit number has fewer than four digits.
   20     Last four digits of the SSN of the crewmember. An error in this entry will result in
          time being lost or credited to another crewmember.
   21     Crewmember‘s last name (printed). May use additional characters if another
          member in the unit has the same last name.
   22     Flight Authorization (FA) Duty Code assigned on the FA to the crewmember for this
          mission. This code cannot be higher than the individual‘s current qualification, but
          will indicate duties that the individual crewmember is scheduled to perform on the
          mission. For example, if the individual is an IP, but is scheduled to perform MP
          duties on a mission, the individual will be listed as an MP on the Flight
          Authorization. Refer to Table A2.3 for a complete list of duty codes. Note: The
          only time the FA code will not match the scheduled duties on the FA is for
          extenuating circumstances. The AC must document the reason in the remarks of the
          AFTO Form 781. For example, a pilot was scheduled to perform IP duties in
 100                                               AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


           conjunction with upgrade training for a second pilot; however, the upgrading
           individual was DNIF and did not fly, so the pilot only performed primary duties. MP
           is logged with primary time and the AC documents the reason in the remarks section.
           When using the FA more than one day, log FA Duty Code actually performed and

      rized non-crew in-flight duty
   To meet OFDA, ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP requirements, aircrew members must comply with
   the following:
      1. Log their flight time using both an aircrew certification code and position identifier
         valid to credit time (a ―Yes‖ in column 3).
      2. Log primary, secondary or instructor flight time. Evaluator flight time is also
         creditable when the evaluator is current in the aircraft. Otherwise the evaluator should
         use the aircrew certification code O or X.
      3. Be attaining or maintaining qualification in the aircraft.
      4. Operational support fliers must log primary time to meet the requirement for HDIP.
         When not performing primary duties, they will log other time. Operational Support
         medical technicians on AOs will only log primary time when performing in-flight
         medical assistance to actual patients. Only other time is authorized for periods of the
         mission when medical assistance is not being provided. EXCEPTION: AFSPC and
         AETC medics will log primary time for that portion of the mission when they perform
         required temporary CEA duties on aircraft equipment (hoists and litters).
      5. Non-interference fliers (other than flying unit commanders) must receive HQ
         USAF/A3O-AT approval to log flying time on AFTO Form 781 and enter data into
         ARMS. See paragraphs 3.2.1.5.2 and 3.2.1.5.3.
      6. Rated officers and CEAs will log second character crew position Z when tasked to
         perform in-flight non-crew duties (e.g. safety observer). Include a remark on the back
         side of the AFTO Form 781 to explain the duty performed.
      7. Must receive HQ USAF/A3O-AT approval to log primary time on AFTO Form 781.
      8. Fifth character will be V for RPA Pilots and S for RPA Sensor Operators.
   Note: MAJCOMs may specify additional characters and may provide supplemental guidance.

                 ARMS AIRCREW/MISSION FLIGHT DATA EXTRACT

A3.1. Purpose. The AF Form 3520 is the source document for recording and reporting flight
training and space shuttle/space station information for each individual authorized to take part in
missions. This form is primarily used for aircrew members attending qualification school or
aircrew logging space time. Aircrew who fly operational missions off-station will use/make an
exact copy of the original AFTO Form 781, certify this as a true extract, and turn in the
form/copy to their HARM or SARM office for updating in ARMS. This is an official record to
validate flight pay eligibility for rated, CEA, and other non-rated officer and enlisted members
required to fly while TDY. This form will not be used for flights involving combat/combat
support operations. The original AF Form 3520,ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract,
must be maintained in the HARM office that services the unit to which the member is assigned.
This form is available for downloading on the Air Force e-Publishing website at www.e-
publishing.af.mil.
A3.2. Scope. The instructions listed on the reverse side of the AF Form 3520 apply to all rated,
CEA, and other non-rated officer and enlisted members authorized to log flight time while
attending training to attain qualification in an aircraft or training device and to log authorized
flights in non-USAF aircraft (includes space shuttle and space station) for the purpose of
maintaining an official Air Force Individual Flight Record. Source documents used to transfer
flight data from non-USAF aircraft are maintained as source documents IAW AFMAN 37-139.
Aircrew who fly operational missions on non-USAF aircraft will use an AFTO Form 781 to
document and record flight activities.
A3.3. Responsibilities. SARM/HARM office personnel are responsible for distributing and
collecting these forms. Completing the AF Form 3520 is a responsibility of the aircrew member.

    INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AF FORM 4327, ARMS FIGHTER FLIGHT
AUTHORIZATION, AND AF FORM 4327A, CREW FLIGHT AUTHORIZATION (FA)

A4.1. Purpose. Unit commanders will use the AF Forms 4327 and 4327a to authorize the use
of USAF aircraft to perform a specific mission(s), and to authorize aircrew members required to
perform in-flight duties. Use the AF Form 4327 to authorize flights of utility, fighter, and trainer
aircraft for missions that originate and end at the same location. Use the AF Form 4327a to
authorize all other aircraft missions and for fighters/trainers (if desired). These are critical
documents used during mission review to validate duties performed/logged on the AFTO Form
781, and for reimbursement of temporary duty expenses. Forms are available for downloading on
the Air Force e-Publishing website at www.e-publishing.af.mil.
   A4.1.1. Additional members authorized to fly, who are not required to perform aircrew
   duties (except for noninterference fliers and MEP when specifically authorized [see
   paragraph A4.1.2]) must be listed on a passenger manifest.
   A4.1.2. The FA accounts for aircrew personnel required/authorized to perform in-flight
   aircrew duties and the passenger manifest lists all additional members approved to fly on the
   aircraft, but not performing specific aircrew duties on that mission. MEP and non-
   interference fliers not on AOs may be listed on the FA, in the Remarks section; if not listed
   on the FA, these individuals will be placed on the passenger manifest. The FA and passenger
   manifest combined account for all personnel on the aircraft.
   A4.1.3. Units may use computer-generated programs to produce AF Forms 4327/4327a in
   lieu of the actual form program. If used, computer-generated forms must duplicate AF forms
   located at the AFDPO e-publishing web site.
A4.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all flying unit commanders with operational control of
USAF aircraft who direct the use of aircraft and aircrews in support of command operations; and
AE, pararescue unit and ANG Senior Scout unit commanders who publish AE/PJ/Senior Scout
flight authorizations for aircrew members assigned to their units who are required to perform
aircrew duties on the mission.
A4.3. Responsibilities. AF Forms 4327 and 4327a are established by this instruction. Aviation
Resource Management personnel are responsible for publication of these forms and performing
Go/No-Go validation (review of ARMS products and member‘s AOs) during pre-mission
review.
   A4.3.1. When additional aircrew members are added after completion of the FA, the
   authenticating official, pilot in command, or flight lead must confirm Go/No-Go
   requirements are accomplished by validating ARMS training products and AOs prior to
   flight.
   A4.3.2. The completed FA and the AFTO Form 781 will be used during post mission review
   to ensure proper documentation and accounting for all aircrew members authorized to
   perform duties. The pilot in command will document deviations between scheduled duties on
   the FA (Duty Position) and actual duties performed in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781.

   A4.3.3. The completed FA is normally filed with other mission paperwork. The Air Force
   Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) lists the minimum disposition requirements of this
   form. MAJCOM supplements may require longer retention times for the form.

NOTES:
1. Only members on AOs, required to perform in-flight duties on that mission are authorized to be
on flight authorizations IAW paragraphs 1.6.2.1. and 1.8.1.
2. Since the AE/PJ/Senior Scout flight authorization is not a stand alone form, the pilot in
command must validate that specific mission elements (blocks 1 thru 10) on AE/PJ/Senior Scout
flight authorizations match the aircraft‘s flight authorization for that specific mission.

                       AFGSC ORIENTATION FLIGHT PROGRAM

A5.1. (Added-AFGSC) General. Orientation flights are regulated by DoD 4515.13-R, Air
Transportation Eligibility. These flights are an exceptional use of USAF aircraft, flown only
when the benefits to the USAF are clearly established. Use these limited resources to familiarize
selected passengers with aircraft capability and employment concepts and to increase public
understanding and appreciation of the USAF. Direct inquiries concerning AFGSC‘s Orientation
Flight Program to HQ AFGSC/A3TA, DSN 781-9830/9832/8057.
   A5.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Flights conducted as ―Public Affairs travel‖ such as civic leader
   and media travel are regulated by DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility. Chapter 3,
   and AFI 35-103, Public Affairs Travel.
A5.2. (Added-AFGSC) The purpose of AFGSC‘s Orientation Flight Program is to reward,
motivate, or increase an individual's understanding of AFGSC‘s mission. There are four
categories of orientation flights: "Incentive Flights," "DV Flights," "Familiarization Flights," and
"Spouse Orientation Flights." This program is a valuable tool to AFGSC and the Air Force, and
effectively managing the program requires strong leadership at all levels to ensure the Air Force
derives the appropriate benefit. Orientation flights for personnel fully knowledgeable of
AFGSC's role and mission (i.e. recently separated or retired rated personnel) are not appropriate
and should not be approved. An orientation flight participant is defined as any individual flying
on an AFGSC aircraft who is not qualified, undergoing qualification training, performing in-
flight duties, or otherwise required to fly in that aircraft for mission accomplishment. A HQ
AFGSC/A3 waiver is required for deviations from this supplement, unless otherwise directed by
AFI 11-401. Waiver requests arising from unusual circumstances must provide compelling
rationale showing benefit to the Air Force.
   A5.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Incentive Flights. Most incentive flight participants will not be
   physiologically prepared for the stresses that can be encountered; therefore, these flights
   restrict normal mission training. Examples: Reward to the Airman-of-the-Quarter or crew
   chiefs taking part in a dedicated crew chief program.
       A5.2.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Incentive orientation flights require dedicated profiles
       during daylight hours, and will be planned and executed in a low-risk environment.
       Incentive orientation flights may be flown either single-ship or two-ship formation. All
       external ordnance will be downloaded from the aircraft. With the exception of takeoff
       and landing, minimum altitude is 1,000 feet AGL (fixed wing) or 300 feet AGL (rotary
       wing).
       A5.2.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Incentive flights will not participate in higher headquarters
       directed exercises, e.g., FLAGs, Roving Sands, etc. Incentive flights may be
       accomplished during non-exercise sorties only.
       A5.2.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC commanders at all levels may nominate individuals
       for incentive flights. Nominee participation is voluntary. A justification must be provided
       with all requests. Send the request to the OG/CC of the unit controlling the aircraft
       requested for the incentive flight. The OG/CC determines what type of orientation flight
120                                                AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


      or profile is appropriate for the individual and who the approval authority will be (see
      AFI 11-401, Table 1.1). Approval requirements include:
         A5.2.1.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) : (a) For flights that require NAF/CC approval,
         requests must be received not later than 14 calendar days prior to the flight; (b) for
         AFGSC/CC/CV/or A3 approval, not later than 21 calendar days prior to the flight;
         and (c) for HAF or higher approval, not later than 30 days prior to the flight. Failure
         to meet these lead times may result in summary disapproval of the request.
         A5.2.1.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) Unless approved by the NAF/A3, children (otherwise
         eligible for orientation flights according to the basic AFI or other DoD directives) of
         wing commanders/vice commanders and group commanders/deputy commanders are
         not eligible for orientation flights aboard assigned aircraft.
      A5.2.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) Incentive Taxi-Ride Program. Units may use aircraft not
      appropriate for spouse orientation flights (e.g., bomber) for incentive taxi rides.
      DRU/CCs or WG/CCs are the approval authorities for this program, but may delegate its
      administration to the OG/CC. To determine an individual‘s eligibility for the program,
      use the same criteria as for orientation flights. Incentive taxi rides must adhere to the
      following requirements:
         A5.2.1.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) The squadron performing the taxi ride will outfit
         participants with the following items: Flight-dress uniforms, flight gloves, flight
         jacket (if required), helmet, oxygen mask, or headset (as appropriate), and torso
         harness (as applicable). Participants will wear flight boots or athletic shoes that
         provide adequate support in the event of ground egress. Aircrew Flight Equipment
         will inspect shoes worn and ensure they are adequate.
         A5.2.1.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) Pilot-in-command will brief participants thoroughly
         on emergency ground egress, as well as handles and switches they must not move,
         i.e., ejection handles. Do not remove ejection pins under any circumstances. Aircraft
         commanders will ensure participants are physically capable of performing emergency
         ground egress in a safe manner.
         A5.2.1.4.3. (Added-AFGSC) Complete all normal taxi, before takeoff and post-
         landing checks and procedures (excluding quick check and removal of ejection pins)
         as appropriate. The pilot will obtain clearance onto the active runway, complete
         checks through after burner initiation (if appropriate), release brakes, and bring the
         throttles to idle after experiencing acceleration. Do not exceed 50 knots during the
         acceleration. Do not exceed maximum taxi distance. Complete appropriate hot
         brakes/wheels inspections (as required) between taxi trips, if making multiple runs.
  A5.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) DV Flights. Like incentive flights, most DV flight participants
  will not be physiologically prepared for the stresses that can be encountered; therefore, these
  flights restrict normal mission training. Examples: Federal government officials, foreign
  officials and members of the House and Senate.
      A5.2.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) DV flights require dedicated profiles, and will be planned
      and executed in a low-risk environment. DV orientation flights may be flown either
      single-ship or two-ship formation. All external ordnance will be downloaded from the
      aircraft and all guns will be mechanically safed. Flights flown at night require WG/CC
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                           121


     approval on a case-by-case basis. WG/CCs will only approve these requests if there is a
     valid requirement and it serves a specific purpose. For example, for flights involving
     civic leaders and most civilian government employees, the benefit gained would not
     warrant the increased risk of exposure to the night flying environment. Conversely,
     members of Congress or their staffs, key federal officials, and general/flag officers could
     be more likely to have a valid requirement to the night flying environment, so the
     increased risk might be acceptable. With the exception of takeoff and landing, minimum
     altitude is 1,000 feet AGL (fixed wing) or 300 feet AGL (rotary wing).
     A5.2.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) During the following exercises, units will not fly DV
     orientation flights unless AFGSC/CC specifically approves them (do not consider
     exercise participants as DVs for this purpose; approval authority is IAW AFI 11-401,
     Table 1.1, as supplemented herein): Red/Green/Maple FLAG in AFGSC aircraft or in a
     primary crew position of other AFGSC aircraft. For all other DV flights, the unit
     providing     the     flight  will     notify   HQ      AFGSC/A3T       via   e-mail
     (AFGSCA3TAWorkflow@barksdale.af.mil) with details regarding the DV flight.
     A5.2.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) When not flying in a primary crew position of other
     AFGSC aircraft during any FLAG exercise, approval authority will be IAW AFI 11-401,
     Table 1.1., as supplemented herein.
     A5.2.2.4. (Added-AFGSC) For all other exercises, HQ AFGSC/A3 is the minimum
     approval authority for DV orientation flights in AFGSC aircraft.
  A5.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) Familiarization Flights: For participants with aviation-related
  responsibilities or who have a requirement to observe routine training missions. Examples:
  USAFA/AFROTC cadet flying, individuals in awaiting permanent change of station training
  (APT) status for SUNT or SUPT, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) pilots, a US military
  aircrew observing a related mission, FAA employees supporting a local base, or HQ USAF
  acquisition personnel observing a related mission area.
     A5.2.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Wing commanders may provide recurring familiarization
     flights to APT officers who are scheduled to attend either SUNT or SUPT. Units will
     conduct APT sorties on a non-interference basis. Individuals in APT status for SUNT or
     SUPT, who have a current and certified Initial Flying Class I (IFC I) physical
     examination, do not require recurring physicals for each familiarization flight if they are
     medically followed by the local flight medicine office, with a flight surgeon as their
     primary care manager.
     A5.2.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) Rules for familiarization flights during exercises are the
     same as for DV flights.
  A5.2.4. (Added-AFGSC) Orientation Flight Requirements and Restrictions.
     A5.2.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) Orientation flights will not be point-to-point flights but
     flown within the local home station or auxiliary flying areas (see note in AFI11-401 table
     1.1 for additional explanation). Point-to-point orientation flights are prohibited by DoD
     4515.13-R. Exception to policy authority is HQ USAF/CV. An orientation flight cannot
     be used for transporting an individual from one location to another.
122                                                 AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012


      A5.2.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) Except for personnel identified in Para A6.2.3.1. above, do
      not use the Orientation Flight Program to provide flights on a recurring basis in the same
      MDS. Exceptions should only be approved on a case-by-case basis when there are
      extenuating circumstances.
      A5.2.4.3. (Added-AFGSC) Do not plan orientation flights on any of the following:
      Aircraft participating in a test program; functional check flights; sea-
      reconnaissance/surveillance training flights; any flight of a special nature where abnormal
      conditions may exist (e.g., record attempts, first flight over an isolated area, an aircraft
      just accepted into the inventory, etc.); or flights that specifically preclude passengers.
      A5.2.4.4. (Added-AFGSC) Approval authorities listed in AFI 11-401, as supplemented
      herein, are the minimum required. Units may not delegate the approval authority.
      A5.2.4.5. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3 is minimum approval authority for
      orientation flights in the B-2 for O-7 and above. For O-6 and below, the WG/CC is the
      approval authority.
      A5.2.4.6. (Added-AFGSC) Authority to approve orientation flights for U.S. personnel
      in foreign aircraft under AFGSC OPCON is the same as for U.S. personnel flying in
      AFGSC aircraft (see table 1.1 and this attachement for further clarification on approval
      authority).
      A5.2.4.7. (Added-AFGSC) Orientation flights in non-USAF aircraft for individuals
      who are otherwise eligible to fly on US Government aircraft will be approved by HQ
      AFGSC/A3. Exception: Combined Forces Air Component Commander (CFACC),
      through his delegated OPCON of USAF Airmen in the CENTCOM AOR and subsequent
      ADCON of those forces, is delegated the authority to approve these type flights in the
      CENTCOM area of responsibility.
      A5.2.4.8. (Added-AFGSC) For Reserve Associate units, AFRC approves their own
      orientation flights, but obtains owning commander concurrence. AFRC units will follow
      orientation flight guidance in AFI 11-401, AFRC Supplement 1, and AFI 35-103.
      A5.2.4.9. (Added-AFGSC) AFI 11-401 governs flights by individuals in rated
      supervisory positions in aircraft under their command. HQ AFGSC/A3TA is the POC for
      rated supervisory flying. Flights not meeting the requirements of AFI 11-401 may be
      flown as familiarization orientation flights as described in paragraph A6.2.3.
      A5.2.4.10. (Added-AFGSC) Consider foreign national military exchange personnel
      who are assigned to AFGSC units as U.S. military for purposes of this instruction, except
      an exchange officer cannot fly in a two-place, U.S. owned aircraft with another foreign
      national. Only pilots who are U.S. citizens can fly a foreign national on an orientation
      flight in a two-place U.S. owned aircraft.
      A5.2.4.11. (Added-AFGSC) Other restrictions may apply. For specific MDS
      restrictions/requirements, see AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3 and AFGSCI 11-2MDS, Vol 3 as
      applicable.
  A5.2.5. (Added-AFGSC) Documentation Requirements: All orientation flight approvals
  will be documented. Participants will be properly manifested on DD Form 2131, Passenger
  Manifest and briefed before flight. Do not place participants on flight authorizations.
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                              123


  Participants will not log time on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data
  Document, nor will they qualify for hazardous duty incentive pay (HDIP).
     A5.2.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) The sponsoring unit must execute DD Form 1381, Air
     Transportation Agreement, before an orientation flight for any person, except DoD
     personnel. Retain form until completion of the flight.
  A5.2.6. (Added-AFGSC) Crew Requirements:
     A5.2.6.1. (Added-AFGSC) For B-2 and T-38A aircraft, the participant will occupy the
     right/rear seat, and will not have control of the aircraft during critical phases of flight.
     With an IP aboard, rated-pilot general/flag officers may fly in the left/front seat provided
     the following is accomplished: Bold Face/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) Test (if
     applicable) and appropriate normal/emergency procedures training in a simulator. For the
     B-2, an instructor pilot is required on all orientation flights. If the orientation flight
     participant is a rated pilot he may occupy either seat, other participants must occupy the
     right seat.
     A5.2.6.2. (Added-AFGSC) For B-52 aircraft: During an approved orientation flight, the
     OG/CC may authorize the orientation flight participant the option of having control of an
     orientation aircraft when the pilot has access to the controls and only during non-critical
     phases of flight provided the orientation flight participant accomplishes the following:
     Bold Face Test and appropriate normal/emergency procedures training in a simulator.
     Control of the aircraft by approved personnel is only allowed during non-critical phases
     of flight (waiver authority to allow general/flag officers and rated pilots to have control of
     the aircraft during critical phases of flight when an IP is at the controls is 8 AF/CC). At
     least one qualified pilot will always occupy one of the pilot positions.
     A5.2.6.3. (Added-AFGSC) For rotary wing aircraft: During an approved orientation
     flight, the OG/CC can authorize active duty, medically qualified pilots, under the direct
     supervision of an IP, to be given control of the aircraft; the IP must be at the other set of
     controls and designated as an instructor on the flight authorization. Control of the aircraft
     by approved personnel is only allowed during non-critical phases of flight (waiver
     authority is 20 AF/CC). For other participants, they may occupy the left seat, with a fully
     qualified pilot or IP in the right seat. All other orientation flights will be IAW paragraph
     1.12.2.3.
     A5.2.6.4. (Added-AFGSC) Critical phases of flight are defined as takeoff, formation
     operations (other than cruise) including air-to-air refueling, but excluding B-52 Fighting
     Wing formation (not considered critical phase of flight), actual live or inert weapon
     deliveries, simulated weapons deliveries (other than level deliveries), tactical
     maneuvering/ACBT where the bank angle exceeds 45 degrees, low altitude flight
     (helicopters below 300 feet AGL, CTP below 1,000 feet AGL, all other aircraft below
     5,000 feet AGL), initial buffet demonstration, radar and other traffic patterns, approach,
     and landing, and hover or air taxi as applicable. RPA: MCE-LRE transfer of control. See
     AFI 11-202V3_ AFGSCSUP, General Flight Rules. Critical phases of flight may be
     further restricted by MDS-specific or unit guidance. No additional passengers are allowed
     on board the aircraft.

      A5.2.6.5. (Added-AFGSC) IAW SECDEF and CSAF policy memos, civilian visitors
      will not fly or otherwise manipulate aircraft controls (Does not apply to civilian and
      contract employees of the US government, but does apply to all other civilian visitors.)
  A5.2.7. (Added-AFGSC) Training Requirements:
      A5.2.7.1. (Added-AFGSC) All participants will receive applicable life support, egress,
      and emergency procedures training and accomplish training hands-on as much as
      practical. For flights in aircraft not configured for normal passenger-carrying operations,
      e.g., bombers, sponsoring unit will fit participants with flight-dress uniforms, gloves,
      jackets (if required), boots, helmets, oxygen masks, and headsets (as appropriate).
      Additionally, if the participant will occupy a primary crew position (or ejection seat), the
      sponsoring unit will conduct cockpit familiarization training in the classroom or
      simulator before the flight. The pilot-in-command will reinforce this training with a
      preflight review in the aircraft. Cockpit familiarization will include the following at a
      minimum: emergency ground egress, participant responsibilities during ground and
      airborne emergencies, canopy loss, loss of intercom, operation of the flight controls, stick
      interference, normal and manual ejection with or without intercom, and the function and
      location of (if applicable) the intercom and radio controls, seat adjustment switch, rudder
      pedal adjustment, leg positioning, oxygen regulator control(s), canopy control(s) and
      normal operation, canopy jettison handle, ejection seat and canopy safing pin(s) use and
      storage, and circuit breaker panel(s).
      A5.2.7.2. (Added-AFGSC) The flight briefing will cover all aspects of the flight to
      reduce apprehension; time pilot advisories in flight to achieve the same objective.
  A5.2.8. (Added-AFGSC) Medical/Physiological Requirements:
      A5.2.8.1. (Added-AFGSC) Units will review and comply with AFI 48-123, Medical
      Examinations and Standards.
      A5.2.8.2. (Added-AFGSC) Participants will obtain physiological training, i.e., current
      altitude chamber card, for flights above 18,000 feet MSL in non-passenger carrying
      aircraft.
      A5.2.8.3. (Added-AFGSC) Units will use the minimum and maximum body weight
      standards for orientation flight candidates outlined in AFI 48-123V3, para A5.10.1.3.
      A5.2.8.4. (Added-AFGSC) Participants will not fly in AFGSC aircraft while taking any
      medication (unless specifically approved by a flight surgeon) or while under the influence
      of alcohol. Participants will wear glasses in lieu of contact lenses. Pregnant women shall
      not fly in ejection-seat aircraft.
      A5.2.8.5. (Added-AFGSC) Sponsoring units should refer USAFA cadets taking part in
      the Operation Air Force Program to the flight medicine office for initial clearance.
  A5.2.9. (Added-AFGSC) Flight Restrictions:
      A5.2.9.1. (Added-AFGSC) In AFGSC aircraft, unless unusual circumstances dictate
      otherwise, pilot-in-command will shut down all engines before participant loading/
      unloading. If necessary to keep the engines operating, pilot-in-command will ensure
      participants are briefed on the hazards of jet engine intake and exhaust areas, and will
      direct a qualified crew member to deplane and supervise the loading/unloading. For
AFI11-401_AFGSCSUP_I 24 JULY 2012                                                             125


     helicopters, participants may unload with both engines running as long as they have
     approved eye protection and a qualified crew member escorts them.
     A5.2.9.2. (Added-AFGSC) Civilian personnel receiving orientation flights will not be
     given control of the aircraft or operate any aircraft flight control, aircraft system, or
     weapon during any phase of flight. However, civilian personnel may be required to
     perform emergency operations, when directed.
     A5.2.9.3. (Added-AFGSC) Do not release classified information to personnel who are
     not appropriately cleared and who do not possess a valid need to know.
     A5.2.9.4. (Added-AFGSC) Do not perform: abrupt or unexpected maneuvers, stalls,
     approaches to stalls, or aircraft buffet training; simulated emergencies, including no-flap
     landings and unusual attitudes; or minimum interval takeoffs. EXCEPTIONS: Crews
     may perform simulated emergencies and minimum interval takeoffs with military/FAA
     air traffic controllers or military rated personnel on board, if an IP is occupying a pilot's
     seat. Helicopters may perform stop-and-go landings, if the mission dictates.
     A5.2.9.5. (Added-AFGSC) Only perform aerobatic flight when the participant desires.
     Weigh such participant requests judiciously to ensure flight experience remains positive.
     Avoid excessive G-loading and extended negative G-flight. Aircrew Flight Equipment
     specialists and pilot-in-command will brief G-LOC and preventive measures for every
     orientation flight in a high-performance aircraft, regardless of the planned G-loading.
  A5.2.10. (Added-AFGSC) Orientation Flight Request Process:
     A5.2.10.1. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3T is the OPR for all OFR staff packages
     requiring HQ AFGSC (or higher) approval. When flying units receive approval
     notification from HQ AFGSC/A3, it constitutes final and complete approval.
     A5.2.10.2. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC units will submit requests with wing commander
     or designated representative‘s endorsement a minimum of 2 calendar weeks (4 calendar
     weeks for nationally prominent civic leaders and news media representatives) before the
     desired flight date, and 6 calendar weeks prior for flights requiring SAF, HAF, or other
     MAJCOM approval.
     A5.2.10.3. (Added-AFGSC) Orientation flight approvals obtained at MAJCOM or
     higher, and delayed for a bona fide reason (e.g., weather, maintenance, etc.), are valid for
     six months from the date of approval. If any condition in bullets below changes between
     the time of flight approval and execution, notify HQ AFGSC/A3T. HQ AFGSC/A3T will
     in turn seek revised approval from HQ AFGSC/A3 or higher, as required. HQ
     AFGSC/A3 will be the normal approval level for revisions, as well as for extensions
     beyond the six-month approval window. Send OFR and revision/extension requests
     requiring HQ AFGSC or higher approval to HQ AFGSC/A3T. Provide an info copy to
     HQ AFGSC/A3TA (addresses: HQ AFGSC/A3T/A3TA, 245 Davis Ave East, Barksdale
     AFB, LA 71110. Send e-mail requests to: AFGSCA3TAWorkflow@barksdale.af.mil
     info : AFGSCA3TWorkflow@barksdale.af.mil. Wing commanders or their designated
     representatives request orientation flights requiring HQ AFGSC or higher approval.
     When these requests are originated by ―designated representatives,‖ the wing commander
     must be aware of and support the orientation flight request. When units submit a late
     request, the unit OG/CC or higher must submit a memo addressed to
