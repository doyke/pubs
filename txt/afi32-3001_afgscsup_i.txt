            requirements outlined in AETC website (https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
            af/USAF/site/AETC/AETC A2_A3/AETC_A3T). The PAST will be
            administered to re-trainee and officer candidates during their required 10-day
            EOD orientation visit.
            1.8.1.1.2.4. Complete 10-day EOD orientation. Re-trainee and officer candidates
            must complete a 10-day EOD orientation visit with an operational Air Force EOD
            flight. If one is not located on station the applicant's unit may fund a TDY to the
            nearest AF Base with an operational AF EOD Flight to complete the 10-day EOD
            orientation.    If unit funds are not available a funding request to HQ
            AFCESA/CEXD may be accomplished. Because there is no guarantee that HQ
            AFCESA/CEXD may be able to fund the TDY, all efforts should be exhausted by
            the re-trainee or officer candidates unit prior to the request. The visit consists of
            10 operational duty days to complete the EOD Orientation Checklist (Attachment
            9) and submit with re-training application. Re-trainee and officer candidates must
            complete the EOD Retraining Volunteer Letter (Attachment 10) during the 10-day

            applies:
                1.8.1.1.2.4.1. Prior service individuals wishing to re-train upon entry into the
                ANG will complete the PAST test and the volunteer letter prior to their 10 day
                orientation. Both will be administered by the recruiter.
                1.8.1.1.2.4.2. For ANG re-trainees and prior-service re-trainees the 10-day
                orientation will be performed with the gaining EOD flight over a consecutive
                number of days to include a drill weekend.
                1.8.1.1.2.4.3. For officers wishing to cross-train into ANG EOD, they may be
                interviewed by a SNCO if no EOD-qualified officer is at the EOD flight or
                within the squadron where they are performing their 10-day orientation. A
                Letter of Recommendation or a Letter of Objection will be composed by the
                interviewer.
                1.8.1.1.2.4.4. The completed package, to include the checklist and the
                interviewer’s letter will be sent to the hiring CES/CC for final approval. If the
                re-trainee is hired, the CES/CC will send the completed package, along with a
                Letter of Approval to the HQ NGB/A7X, for final coordination.
                1.8.1.1.2.4.5. The CES/CC will also send the completed package, their Letter
                of Approval, and the signed Volunteer letter to the Air Force Reserve
                Personnel Center.
         1.8.1.1.3. Specialty requires routine access to Top Secret material or similar
         environment. For award and retention of AFSC 32E3H/K and 3E8X1, completion of
         a current Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) according to AFI 31-501,
         Personnel Security Program Management is required.
         1.8.1.1.4. The EOD AFSC is high risk and such is a volunteer only career field.
         Members “MUST BE A VOLUNTEER” to enter the DoD Joint EOD Basic Common
         Core Course. (Reference: Catalog of Navy Training Courses (CANTRAC): A-431-
         0134). All non-prior service Airmen, re-trainees and officer candidates must
         complete the appropriate EOD volunteer letter (Attachment 10 or Attachment 11)
         prior to entering the EOD training pipeline. The signed volunteer letter must be held
         on file in the members Personal Information File.
         1.8.1.1.5. If at any time an Airman feels he/she is incapable of performing the high
         risk duties related to the EOD mission, the member may withdraw their EOD
         volunteer letter. This will result in permanent removal from the EOD career field.
         Once withdrawn, at no time may the volunteer letter be reinstated.
     1.8.1.2. This paragraph supplements AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of
     AF Personnel, paragraph 5.9.2, Occupational Badges for officers. For award of the
     senior and master EOD badges to EOD-qualified CE Officers, the phrase "in the
     specialty" includes those jobs, which are responsible for EOD organize, train, and equip
     functions. Examples include CE Squadron commander jobs in which individuals lead
     squadrons with EOD flights and MAJCOM CE Readiness Directorate chiefs.
  1.8.2. Proficiency. EOD personnel must maintain competency in all aspects of the EOD
  mission. Completion of the minimum training requirements listed in the 3E8X1 Career Field
24                                             AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


  Education Training Program (CFETP), Section G; AF EOD Standard Training Package, is
  required to maintain proficiency.
  1.8.3. Suspension or Removal from EOD Duties and the EOD Flight. Because of the nature
  of EOD duties (working with live explosives and providing protective support to Presidential
  and DOS personnel), Airmen may be removed from EOD duties and the flight when their
  reliability and judgment are called into question. Removal from EOD duties by itself is
  neither an adverse personnel action nor the basis for disciplinary action. When making a
  removal determination, the issue is not an individual’s guilt or innocence of a particular
  offense. It is not necessary to complete an investigation, take disciplinary action, or to
  complete other personnel actions before determining to remove an individual from EOD
  duties.
     1.8.3.1. Removal may be appropriate based on a single serious incident or habitual minor
     incidents, reflecting behavior that is inconsistent with military standards and raises
     questions about an individual’s reliability and judgment. The following examples may
     constitute grounds for suspension or removal from the flight.
         1.8.3.1.1. Any alcohol-related incident, alcohol abuse, or alcohol dependency.
         1.8.3.1.2. Significant delinquent financial obligations.
         1.8.3.1.3. Negligence or delinquency in performing duties that reveals a lack of
         dependability, flexibility, good attitude or good judgment.
         1.8.3.1.4. Arrest for, or conviction by a military or civilian court of, a serious
         offense; a series or arrests or court convictions for misdemeanor offenses; or more
         than one Article 15, which would indicate a pattern of conduct contrary to the
         standards required of EOD personnel.
         1.8.3.1.5. Any significant physical or medical condition determined to be prejudicial
         to reliable performance of EOD duties.
         1.8.3.1.6. Poor attitude or lack of motivation as evidenced by aberrant or irrational
         behavior, inappropriate behavior or mood.
         1.8.3.1.7. Failure to maintain a proper grade/skill relationship.
         1.8.3.1.8. Failure to maintain fitness standards within AF regulations or to a level
         required to conduct full spectrum EOD operations within CONUS and contingency
         environments.
     1.8.3.2. Establishment of a Security Information File or suspension of access to
     classified information will result in temporary removal from EOD duties and the flight.
     Revocation of security clearance eligibility will result in disqualification from EOD
     duties and removal from the flight.
     1.8.3.3. When the conditions described in paragraph 1.8.3.1 occur, commanders may
     take the following actions:
         1.8.3.3.1. Temporary suspension from duties and the EOD flight. Immediately
         suspend an individual for up to 180 days in order to determine whether, given the
         nature of the incident(s), the individual’s reliability and judgment meet the standards
         for reinstatement to EOD duties.
AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                                      25


            1.8.3.3.2. Permanent disqualification of an individual from EOD duties. Situations
            such as the following may warrant for permanent disqualification: confirmed drug
            abuse, a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, pending involuntary discharge or removal
            for cause, a diagnosed psychiatric disorder that interferes with member’s ability to
            perform military duties, imposition of more than one Article 15 within a short period
            of time, pending court-martial charges and/or conviction, pending civilian criminal
            felony or misdemeanor charges and/or conviction. Commanders should seek legal
            advice before permanently removing an individual from EOD duties.2
            1.8.3.3.3. Reinstatement. A commander may request reinstatement of an individual’s
            qualification for EOD duties provided the reason or condition of the permanent
            disqualification no longer exists. Forward all requests for reinstatement to HQ
            AFCESA/CEXD. The request will include chain of command recommendations and
            all documentation that substantiated the permanent disqualification and
            documentation that supports the opinion that the condition or reason no longer exists.
        1.8.3.4. Appeal. An individual may appeal a permanent disqualification. Individuals
        must provide a written request for an appeal with rationale. Forward all appeal requests to
        HQ AFCESA/CEXD for AFCESA/CC approval or disapproval. The request will include
        chain of command recommendations and all documentation that substantiated the
        disqualification determination.
    1.8.4. Interruption in EOD duties. Enlisted EOD personnel must reaccomplish the basic
    EOD course when assigned 48 months or longer in a non-EOD position or if there is a 36-
    month or longer break in service. Under extenuating circumstances (i.e., if special EOD
    training or operations were accomplished during that time), this requirement may be fulfilled
    if the individual can be recertified on all CFETP Core Tasks (commensurate with grade/skill
    level), and attend the Advanced Improvised Explosive Device Disposal (AIEDD) course.
        1.8.4.1. For AD forces the AF EOD CFM, in consultation with the responsible
        MAJCOM, has waiver authority for this requirement on a case-by-case basis.
            1.8.4.1.1. The individual’s prior service EOD history will be evaluated to ensure the
            individual is qualified for EOD duties, meets criteria listed in Officer/Enlisted
            Classification Directory, and meets AF Quality Standards.
            1.8.4.1.2. Waiver authority for ARC forces is delegated to the ARC EOD Functional
            Managers.
            1.8.4.1.3. ARC EOD personnel who are excused from unit training assemblies [not
            constructively present] for six months or more will be recertified on all skill level
            tasks.

 NOTE: Permanent disqualification of an individual from EOD duties may include removal of the EOD
qualification duty badge. Submit recommendations for removal through EOD MAJCOM functional staff to HQ
AFCESA/CEXD for determination.

      1.8.5. Re-training: EOD will not accept enlisted Airmen above the rank of SSgt for
      retraining. EOD operations require experienced technical leadership.3
         1.8.5.1. DELETED.
         1.8.5.2. ARC Airman requesting entry into the EOD career field must be briefed by the
         local EOD team on career field mission, tools, equipment, physical requirements, and
         view the EOD recruiting video. This briefing must be documented on a memorandum for
         record.
      1.8.6. Incentive Pay. This section outlines service component requirements in compliance
      with DoD 7000-14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 7A, Military Pay
      Policy and Procedures – Active Duty and Reserve Pay.
         1.8.6.1. EOD personnel in a valid EOD position receiving demolition pay must
         document monthly qualifications.
         1.8.6.2. During periods of deployments and at locations where monthly qualification is
         not possible, MFM or deployed EOD leadership may temporarily waive this requirement
         (see paragraph 3.11.1.2 through 3.11.1.2.2) by documenting dates, location and either
         combat operations being performed or country restrictions preventing explosive
         operations.

Section 1D—Manning

1.9. Operational Manning Requirements.
      1.9.1. Deployment Coding. All EOD flight personnel will be coded DWS except as noted
      below. The minimum Break-the-Flight positions at each AD EOD flight (6 at normal base, 8
      at Direct Support Unit [DSU], 20 at Large Range base) will be coded DXS. All AF EOD
      instructors (NAVSCOLEOD and Silver Flag) will be coded DXX. EOD Staff positions at
      HQ USAF, HQ AFCESA/CEXD, MAJCOM and Det 63 will be coded DXS. ARC AGRs
      will be coded DXX. HQ AFRC A7X will, in coordination with HQ ACC/A7X (SuperFam),
      HQ AFPC/DPWS, and HQ AFCESA/CEXD, provide input for a posturing plan for the
      Active Guard Reserve (AGR) deployment schedule. All other EOD positions not addressed
      in this paragraph will be coded DXS. This paragraph does not apply to EOD positions that
      are joint, owned by others, or classified.
      1.9.2. Manpower Standard and Unit Personnel Management Roster (UPMR). The
      Capability-based Manpower Standard (CMS) for AF EOD is AFMS 44ED00 (This CMS is
      available electronically on the Air Force Manpower Agency (AFMA) website.). This CMS
      quantifies the Civil Engineer flight level manpower necessary to accomplish Air Force EOD
      tasks based upon the number and type of EOD UTC taskings.
      1.9.3. EOD Flight Posturing. Per the AF/A7C-approved EOD Optimization Plan, the EOD
      Capability-based Manpower Standard (CMS), when implemented, will structure EOD flights
      as large-range flights (72 personnel), large force-projection flights (26 personnel), small

 NOTE: Limiting re-training to E-5s provides for an approximate 10 year experience/growth into flight
management and team leadership; additionally, it parallels requirements for civilian supervision of explosive
operations (DDESB Technical Paper 16) and US Army EOD TTP that calls for E-6 squad leaders.
AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                         27


  force-projection flights (19 personnel). OCONUS Defense flight requirements are 12
  personnel. ARC EOD flights are structured as Homeland Defense flights (10-17 personnel).
     1.9.3.1. USAF EOD Minimum Sustainable Manpower. Ten personnel, 30 at large range
     flights, are required to meet all mission area requirements identified in AFPD 32-30,
     Explosive Ordnance Disposal. This provides sufficient manpower structure to 1) maintain
     missions for an indefinite period of time; 2) provides the proper leadership & mentoring;
     3) and maintain required training proficiency. Up to three of these personnel (1 at Direct
     Support units) can be available to support VIPPSA and RST missions. The additional 20
     personnel at Large range flights are required to maintain emergency response for range
     operations. Support for scheduled range clearances, as outlined in AFI 13-212, Range
     Planning and Operations, will require manning augmentation from other EOD flights.
     The numbers provided in this paragraph are not additive requirements and will not
     exceed the requirements provided in the CMS.
     1.9.3.2. USAF EOD minimum Break-the-Flight manpower. If, during surge or
     emergency operations, an EOD flight falls below Sustainable manpower, a degraded
     capability exists.
         1.9.3.2.1. A manpower structure of 6-9 personnel is only sufficient to provide limited
         mission areas support and only a single incident response capability. At no time will
         flight manning fall below 6 (8 for direct support units, 20 at large range bases
         including manning or RST support) without MAJCOM concurrence. Direct support
         units require 8 personnel to ensure a minimum of 6 operational personnel for
         emergency response (accounts for temporary suspension from Personnel Reliability
         Program (PRP) due to medications or other reliability issues).
            1.9.3.2.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Direct support units maintain at least eight PRP-
            and weapons-certified members to support special weapons and strategic
            operations. (T-1) Units will only go below eight PRP- and weapons-certified
            members with the approval of the Squadron Commander and MAJCOM
            Manager. (T-1)
         1.9.3.2.2. Support for missions that are beyond emergency installation and force
         protection response (e.g., missions other than nuclear/strategic mission, force
         protection, and aircraft/munitions response) require critical operational risk
         management (ORM) determination. At this level of manning, required training
         proficiency and certifications are difficult to maintain. Flights falling below
         minimum manning requirements for periods longer than 30 days should request
         manning assistance (term temp civilian/contractor support for program management
         support) through their respective MAJCOM functional manager.
            1.9.3.2.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Due to the requirement for EOD personnel to
            maintain training and certification on weapon systems and nuclear
            incident/accident-related response tasks coupled with the high operations tempo
            due to Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) taskings, EOD flight manning will require
            prioritization of competing requirements. EOD flights will participate in Nuclear
            Surety Inspections and Unit Effectiveness Inspections; however, due to higher
            priority mission commitments, EOD flight manning may require limited
            participation in Nuclear Operational Readiness Inspections (NORI). (T-1)
28                                       AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


        Limited play allows EOD flights to focus efforts on mission and training
        requirements while allowing participation in the inspection where these objectives
        overlap.
            1.9.3.2.2.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) When EOD flight manning is less than 33%
            available, flights will not be inspected or graded. EOD participation will
            consist of providing 24-hour command and control (C2) coverage (e.g.
            Emergency Operations Center (EOC)) and maintaining real-world EOD
            emergency response capabilities. (T-2) When EOD flight manning is
            between 33% and 66% available, EOD flight participation will be limited and
            the flight will not be inspected or graded. EOD participation will consist of
            providing 24-hour C2 coverage (e.g. EOC), and maintaining real-world EOD
            emergency response capabilities. (T-2) When personnel are available, flights
            will provide one response team for 12-hour operations during inspection
            events/scenarios. When EOD flight manning is 66% available or greater,
            EOD flight will participate in an NORI and the flight will be inspected or
            graded. (T-2)
            1.9.3.2.2.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) Submit projected available manning,
            limiting factors and simulations 14 days post-notification of an NORI or
            receipt of an AEF tasking that impacts NORI participation to AFGSC/A7X
            for coordination with AFGSC/IG. (T-3)
        1.9.3.2.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) Flights request manning assistance through
        AFGSC/A7XE. (T-2) Requesting unit is responsible for all per diem and travel.
        AFGSC/A7XE will look first from within command to provide manning
        assistance.
        1.9.3.2.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC/A7XE should request Guard and AFRC
        personnel to support flight operations. Man-day requests are completed on an AF
        Form 49, Application for MPA Man-Day Tour, and will contain supplemental
        data as required by AFGSC/A7XE. Personnel providing manning assistance to
        units may participate in response to incidents and accidents after completion of
        local IJQS training. (T-2) Personnel that are not PRP-certified or weapons-
        systems certified may assist response operations in a supporting capacity.
        1.9.3.2.2.4. (Added-AFGSC) Manning assistance participation. AFGSC EOD
        personnel will not participate (volunteered or tasked) in other MAJCOM/sister
        services’ manning support missions without prior coordination with

       arrival at the deployed location IAW theater guidance.

Section 2C—Safety Programs

2.4. Weapons Safety. EOD requirements for Weapons Safety are covered in AFMAN 91-201,
Air Force Explosives Safety Standards and Technical Order 60A-1-1-4, Protection of Personnel
and Property. When information between these two references conflict, always use the more
stringent safety reference. Prior to the start of all explosive operations on training, demolition, or
bombing ranges the Team Leader (TL) or a Team Member (TM) will complete Attachment 8,
Standard Pre-Operation Safety Briefing and brief all individuals present during the explosive
operation using the completed form.
   2.4.1. Proficiency range parameters. The authorized procedures on EOD ranges allow for
   reduced safe separation distances. Specifications for EOD proficiency ranges are listed in
   AFMAN 91-201, Air Force Explosives Safety Standards.
   2.4.2. Emergency destruction on established ranges. In cases where the net explosive weight
   and fragmentation hazards exceed the established quantity-distance criteria for a range,
   obtain installation commander’s permission, perform ORM, and use protective measures to
   ensure safe operations.
   2.4.3. EOD Training and Disposal Range Requirements. All EOD Proficiency Training
   Ranges will be cited IAW AFMAN 91-201 requirements. All Disposal Ranges will be cited
   IAW AFMAN 91-201 and Attachment 5, Disposal Range Safety Requirements Excerpt, to
   this publication.
2.5. Ground Safety Programs. Occupational Safety requirements are listed in AFI 91-203, Air
Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction. EOD flights must participate in the
following health and safety programs.
   2.5.1. Environmental Management System, Hazardous Communication (HAZCOM).
   2.5.2. Respiratory Protection Program.
   2.5.3. Blood Borne Pathogen (BBP).
       2.5.3.1. With use of established control procedures (use of personal protective equipment
       (PPE) and good hygiene); normal home-station EOD duties do not warrant participation
       in the BBP program.
 32                                           AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


      2.5.3.2. If local or deployed special EOD missions create a high potential for exposure to
      BBP, then EOD flights will coordinate with Bioenvironmental Engineering and Public
      Health flights to determine whether enrollment in this program is appropriate.
      2.5.3.3. Refer to Title 29 CFR, Part 1910, subpart Z, Standard 1910-1030, Bloodborne
      Pathogens (29 CFR 1910-1030), for requirements on training and a written exposure
      control plan. (See also the sample guides in the EOD Mortuary Support CONOPS).
   2.5.4. As-Low-As-Reasonably-Achievable (ALARA).
   2.5.5. Hearing conservation.
2.6. Safety Day. All CONUS and Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) units will
participate in the annual EOD Safety Day. Participation of deployed/forward locations will
depend upon their current operations tempo and the approval of their respective combatant
commander (CCDR). HQ AFCESA/CEXD, and all MAJCOMS will provide A7CXR with
Safety Day agenda items no later than (NLT) 15 days prior to event. Emergency response
operations will not be effected on this day.

                           OPERATIONS AND TRAINING / A3

Section 3A—Operational Parameters

3.1. General Unexploded Ordnance Response Actions
   3.1.1. Positive Identification. Responding EOD teams must positively identify all ordnance
   items prior to performing any EOD procedures.
      3.1.1.1. All research and identification of ordnance items will be documented in EOD
      reports and verified as outlined in paragraph 3.7. If unable to identify the ordnance item
      the team must assume:
          3.1.1.1.1. It is the most hazardous type it could be.
          3.1.1.1.2. It has the most hazardous features/filler it could contain.
          3.1.1.1.3. It is in the most hazardous condition it could be in.
      3.1.1.2. EOD flights will put statements in their response guides that the team must
      positively identify ordnance using EOD technical data prior to performing any EOD
      procedures. If no technical data exists for the item in question, then other means will be
      used to identify ordnance. For EXAMPLE: x-rays could be used to help identify what
      type of filler is inside the ordnance and the type of fuzing or a request for information can
      be sent to the NAVEODTECHDIV through Det 63, HQ ACC. The Joint EOD Technical
      Support Center is a resource available for assistance at 1-877-EOD INFO (1-877-363-
      4636).
      3.1.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) Notify AFGSC/A7XE immediately on request or completion
      of any response that requires emergency EOD action, i.e., render safe attempt of a
      suspected IED, any disposal deemed an emergency, or any Level 1 or 2 response. (T-3)
      Contact AFGSC/A7XE via e-mail, telephone or cellular phone and provide initial
      information of the response. (T-3) Depending on the incident, the EOD Information
      Management System (EODIMS) events log may need to be initiated to provide upward
      visibility of the situation.
      3.1.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) During EOD operations and training, flights are not
      authorized to employ demolition material, EOD equipment/supplies using explosives or
      equipment controlling the initiation of explosives without approved technical data and
      NNMSB approval. (T-1) Detachment 63, ACC, serves as the AF action office for
      approval of joint 60-series technical data and is responsible for development of
      preliminary technical data for AF-unique EOD equipment and procedures. All
      preliminary technical data is approved by AFGSC/A7XE before release to EOD flights
      for use. (T-1)
   3.1.2. EOD Technical Guidance. EOD procedures are conducted IAW Joint Service EOD
   60-series TOs. Supporting instructions such as 11-series TOs or DDESB Technical Papers
   (available at http://www.ddesb.pentagon.mil/techpapers.html) may be used in absence of
   60-series guidance. Additionally, basic EOD emergency response guidance is provided in
34                                            AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


  Attachment 3, EOD Emergency Response Guidance. Local commanders have the authority
  and responsibility to make ORM adjustment to established requirements so that mission
  requirements are met. (See AFI 90-901, Operational Risk Management)
     3.1.2.1. Deviations from 60N series can be made with coordination and approval with
     MAJCOM and 708th Nuclear Sustainment Squadron (708th NSUS), Military Liaison
     Branch. During accident response, deviations from 60N are obtained through the Nuclear
     Weapon Accident Response Procedures (NARP) weapon recovery process. By design,
     60N series publications do not address all potential accident/incident scenarios. During an
     accident situation EOD personnel in collaboration with DOE Accident Response Group
     (ARG) will develop a weapons recovery plan incorporating pertinent paragraphs from
     specific weapon 60N series tech order.
  3.1.3. Medical support. Medical support during high-explosives operations is a mandatory
  safety requirement. Medical support must remain in a designated safe area unless required for
  injury/incident response. Medical support may be military, civilian, or contracted as long as
  the qualifications are current and time criteria are met.
     3.1.3.1. Explosives operations involving only practice munitions (other than demolition
     explosives): An Independent Duty Medical Technician (IDMT) or Emergency Medical
     Technician (EMT)-qualified technician must be available on-site or within a 30-minute
     response time. Trauma facilities should be available within 60 minutes via ground or air
     transportation.
     3.1.3.2. Explosives operations involving live munitions (other than demolition
     explosives): An IDMT-qualified technician must be available on-site during all
     operations. An IDMT provides capability to give Advanced Cardiac Life Support
     measures such as administering emergency intravenous medications. Trauma facilities
     should be available within 30 minutes via ground or air transportation. If not possible,
     then ensure a paramedic or EMT with current NREMT (National Registry of Emergency
     Medical Technicians) certification is available on-range. Additionally, flights should
     consider the need to bring an IDMT during off-base emergency response.
     3.1.3.3. EOD flights performing daily, multiple, simultaneous explosives operations
     involving live munitions should have an IDMT-qualified technician dedicated/assigned to
     the EOD flight. IDMT would be within 30-minute response time to all explosives
     operating sites. Supplement the IDMT with EMT-qualified technicians on-site at each
     operating site, e.g., one IDMT is centrally located within 30-minutes of the operations.
     Each operating site would have an EMT immediately available.
  3.1.4. Off-Installation Responses
     3.1.4.1. Military munitions and explosives.
         3.1.4.1.1. The closest AF EOD flight is required to respond to accidents/incidents
         involving AF-owned EO on or off AF installations. The first service to discover an
         incident involving EO of another service or Federal agency must take immediate
         actions to prevent or limit damage or injury. Report incidents occurring in another
         service's operational area according to the procedures of the responsible service. The
         closest EOD flight should respond immediately with the understanding that the
AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                                               35


             responsible service retains operational control. After DoD arrives on scene, the
             various services can sort out responsibilities per AFJI 32-3002.
             3.1.4.1.2. The first service to discover a transportation accident/incident involving
             federally owned or controlled EO must respond immediately, regardless of location.
             The EOD team should arrive on-scene as soon as possible (within 4 hours). Use the
             fastest mode of transportation available. The objective is to prevent or limit loss of
             life, injury, property damage, and minimize public inconvenience.4
        3.1.4.2. Non-military munitions and explosives.
             3.1.4.2.1. Civil authorities are primarily responsible for the safe handling and
             disposal of IED, non-military commercial explosives, or similarly dangerous articles
             located off DoD installations. See details for off-installation support in paragraphs
             7.2 and 7.3.
             3.1.4.2.2. Non-DoD toxic or hazardous materials are not taken to military
             installations for storage or disposal unless:
                 3.1.4.2.2.1. The situation is clearly an emergency or lifesaving operation.
                 3.1.4.2.2.2. Formal agreements exist with other Federal agencies (e.g., MOU
                 between DoD and the ATF).
    3.1.5. Environmental Guidance. All AF EOD flights within the US and its territories must
    comply with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) EPA Military Munitions
    Rule, and other state regulatory requirements. EOD Response Actions are conducted under
    authority of the “DoD Policy to implement the federal EPA Military Munitions Rule
    (MRIP),” 01 July 1998, Chapter 9, Emergency Response. The MRIP is very specific about
    the conduct of emergency response and EOD’s authority to conduct them.
        3.1.5.1. In non-emergency situations, to ensure all legal requirements are met, EOD
        personnel must consult the Staff Judge Advocate and the installation CE environmental
        management function before destroying EO. (See paragraph 3.2 for emergency response
        parameters.)
        3.1.5.2. The federal EPA has established definitions for when munitions become a waste
        and requirements for management of waste munitions. These definitions and
        requirements are incorporated into RCRA’s implementing regulations. The federal
        program exempts EOD operations from some environmental management requirements
        during an EOD emergency response action for munitions and other explosive devices
        (military and non-military). The degree of exemption from federal RCRA regulations
        depends upon the level of response. However, states may have more stringent
        requirements than the federal regulations.
        3.1.5.3. The DoD has created two levels of EOD emergency response; immediate
        response (Level 1) and imminent and substantial endangerment (Level 2). The primary
        distinction between the two levels is that a Level 2 response can be delayed without


4
 NOTE: The first priority is an immediate response to the accident or incident. After DoD arrives on scene, the
various services can sort out responsibilities per AFJI 32-3002.
    36                                                AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


         compromising safety or increasing the risks posed to life, property, health, or the
         environment.
             3.1.5.3.1. Treat all requests for EOD response as a Level 1 response until determined
             otherwise. From an explosives safety point of view, when EOD Teams are
             dispatched, the situation requires an immediate response.
             3.1.5.3.2. The on-scene EOD Team Leader determines if the situation requires a
             Level 1, Level 2, or no EOD emergency response. See Attachment 1 Terms for the
             definition of an EOD Team Leader.
             3.1.5.3.3. Only the senior on-scene EOD Team Leader can determine when the
             response action is complete. For a Level 2 response, temporary storage in a munitions
             storage facility should not terminate the emergency nature of the response – normally,
             wait for termination until final destruction or shipment to a destruction facility.
      3.1.6. EOD Response Time. EOD units will adhere to the following response time
      parameters when responding to all emergency incidents requiring EOD support. Exception:
      ANG EOD units will establish response time parameters with Wing leadership that will best
      support their Wing/local mission.
         3.1.6.1. Normal duty hours: EOD teams will be en route to the incident site within 30-
         minutes of initial notification or within 30 minutes of approval from the Wing CC for
         “immediate response authority” support to DSCA.
         3.1.6.2. Off duty hours: EOD flights are not manned for 24/7 operations and therefore
         provide standby teams for off-duty immediate response. The goal for any incident off-
         duty is to respond in the most expeditious manner while taking safety, road conditions
         and other factors into account. Taking these factors into account the goal for off-duty
         EOD team response is to be responding to the scene within 60 minutes after initial
         notification or within 60 minutes of approval from the Wing CC for "immediate response
         authority" support to DSCA.
3.2. Explosives or Munitions Emergency Response: Level 1 emergency response actions are
exempt from RCRA permitting, Department of Transportation (DOT) manifesting for movement
to a safe disposal area, and other substantive requirements under Title 40 CFR.5 However, Level
2 emergency response actions may be subject to emergency permitting and other requirements.
When, during an emergency response, applicable state law or an agreement requires, or the
situation allows, the installation environmental office will consult with environmental regulators
on the need for permits and fulfilling other requirements.
      3.2.1. Level 1 Emergency Response (Immediate Response). A Level 1 Emergency could
      occur anywhere. A Level 1 Emergency requires immediate response activities to eliminate or
      address the actual or potential imminent threat to life, property, health or the environment.

        3.2.1.1. A Level 1 Emergency exists if a delay in response activities would compromise
        safety or increase the risks posed to life, property, health or the environment.6 A Level 1
        Emergency may exist if:
            3.2.1.1.1. The risk associated with movement of the military munitions or other
            explosives involved is unknown or not acceptable; or
            3.2.1.1.2. The risk associated with the military munitions or other explosives
            temporary storage, or careful movement beyond a nearby, more isolated and
            protected location for immediate rendering-safe or destruction, is not acceptable.
        3.2.1.2. The lead on-site EOD Team Leader will, with regard to any explosive or
        chemical agent hazard presented: (a) determine whether a Level 1 Emergency exists, and
        (b) when to terminate a Level 1 Emergency response, or reclassify it to a Level 2
        response. Once the immediate hazards associated with military munitions or other
        explosives are eliminated, the supported installation or activity may have to perform
        other actions to address the impact of the response action. (See paragraph 3.2.3 below.)
        3.2.1.3. EOD-conducted response actions during a Level 1 Emergency could involve
        defusing, detonation, or other actions to neutralize a munition “in-place,” or careful,
        limited movement to a nearby, more isolated and protected location, including to an
        operational range used by or limited to EOD operations, to defuse, detonate, or otherwise
        abate the immediate threat.
        3.2.1.4. Level 1 emergency response actions, where the response cannot be delayed
        without compromising safety or increasing the risks posed to life, property, health, or the
        environment, are exempt from RCRA permitting, DOT manifesting for movement to a
        safe disposal area, and other substantive requirements.
            3.2.1.4.1. Level 1 EOD response actions are exempt from federal RCRA permitting
            requirements.
            3.2.1.4.2. Response may occur on-site or the item may be transported to a more
            secure location.
            3.2.1.4.3. No Hazardous Waste Manifest is required.
            3.2.1.4.4. Transporter of the item does not need a RCRA identification number.
            3.2.1.4.5. Item may be held in appropriate storage as a continuation of the response if
            a proper location for the response action is unavailable due to extenuating
            circumstances (e.g., adverse weather, nightfall, or other safety considerations).
            3.2.1.4.6. Storage location does not have to be a RCRA interim status or RCRA
            permitted facility or comply in any way with RCRA; however, it must comply with
            DDESB standards.
        3.2.1.5. Items such as UXO’s, rendered-safe munitions, partial munitions, damaged, and
        broken munitions components will be destroyed by EOD under Level 1 response based
        on potential imminent threat at the earliest opportunity. Only under rare exception would

 NOTE: A reasonable delay in EOD's completion of an explosives or munitions emergency response that is caused
by necessary, unforeseen, or uncontrollable circumstances does not automatically terminate a Level 1 Emergency.
38                                           AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


     EOD turn-in munitions from a Level 1 response to munitions personnel. EOD team
     leaders who determine a Level 2 or non-emergency (turn-in for Designated Disposition
     Authorities (DDA) determination) approach to be more appropriate must document the
     reasons for their decision in the EODIMS report of the response.
  3.2.2. Level 2 Emergency Response (Imminent and Substantial Endangerment). A Level 2
  Emergency also poses an actual or potential imminent threat to life, property, health or
  human health or the environment, but does not require immediate response activities to
  eliminate or address the actual or potential imminent threat. Level 2 Emergency response
  actions can generally be delayed for a reasonable period without adverse impact.
     3.2.2.1. A Level 2 Emergency exists if the response actions can be delayed without
     compromising safety or increasing the risks posed to life, property, health, or the
     environment. A Level 2 Emergency may exist if:
         3.2.2.1.1. The risk associated with movement and temporary storage of the military
         munitions or other explosives involved is acceptable; and
         3.2.2.1.2. The military munitions or other explosives are positively identified, are
         safe for transport by explosives or munitions emergency response specialists, and can
         be stored (temporarily) within DoD munitions logistic management system pending
         appropriate response action (e.g., on-site destruction or movement to an appropriate
         destruction facility).
     3.2.2.2. The on-site EOD Team Leader will, with regard to the explosive or chemical
     agent hazard presented, determine: (1) whether a Level 2 Emergency exists; (2) when to
     terminate a Level 2 Emergency; and/or (3) when to re-classify a Level 2 Emergency (e.g.,
     risks become unacceptable) to a Level 1 Emergency. Once immediate hazards associated
     with military munitions or other explosives are eliminated, supported installation or
     activity may have to perform other actions to address impact of the response action.
     3.2.2.3. The host installation's Environmental Office/Hazardous Waste Program
     Manager is responsible for consulting with environmental regulators to determine
     whether other regulatory requirements must be satisfied (e.g., a requirement to seek a
     RCRA emergency permit under section Title 40 CFR Part 270.61) and to obtain requisite
     emergency transportation and/or treatment permits. Emergency permits are usually
     granted orally with written follow-up.
         3.2.2.3.1. Off-base response permits. EOD flights should pre-coordinate local/state
         off-base permitting procedures with the installation environmental office. Under
         normal circumstances;
            3.2.2.3.1.1. If the EOD flight is responding to a military munition, then request
            the installation environmental office obtain necessary permits.
            3.2.2.3.1.2. If responding to other than a military munition, then the civil
            authorities requesting support are responsible for requesting the necessary
            permits.
         3.2.2.3.2. For items turned-in to the munitions storage area, the munitions activity
         will immediately request the installation environmental office obtain necessary
         permits and state notifications as required by local directives.
AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                                                39


             3.2.2.3.3. (Added-AFGSC) An emergency permit will not be relied on as a method
             of treating munitions on a regular basis. An example of a non-immediate response
             would be treating the munitions that are recovered from an aircraft crash. They are
             typically retained until the crash investigation is over, but cannot be certified safe to
             ship.
         3.2.2.4. Items creating a Level 2 emergency normally include non-DoD (commercial or
         foreign) munitions found on base (FOB) or recovered from an emergency, and munitions
         that have been in the public domain and not been within the DoD logistics system (cannot
         track the type of environment and handling the item has been subjected to). These items
         are normally destroyed by EOD as a Level 2 response. They may be temporarily held in
         storage awaiting permits or other circumstantial requirements; but as a Level 2, DDA
         concurrence/ approval is not required for destruction. Coordinate with the base
         environmental function before conducting a level 2 response. Only under rare exception
         would EOD turn-in munitions from a Level 2 response to munitions personnel for DDA
         determination. EOD team leaders who determine a non-emergency (turn-in for DDA
         determination) approach to be more appropriate must document the reasons for their
         decision in the EODIMS report of the response and inform the local environmental
         and/or munitions storage functions as appropriate.
    3.2.3. Site Remediation. EOD personnel do not conduct planned munitions responses;
    however, they will respond to explosives or munitions emergencies that occur during planned
    responses. (See paragraphs 3.4.6.2.2, 3.4.6.2.3, 3.4.6.2.4, and 3.4.6.2.5)
    3.2.4. Significant Disagreement. If, during an explosives or munitions emergency response,
    environmental regulators and safety officials have serious concerns about the potential
    impact of EOD proposed course of action on human health and environment, the following
    applies:
         3.2.4.1. By DoD policy, EOD personnel are not allowed to take any action inconsistent
         with approved EOD procedures or would place the EOD team at added risk.
         3.2.4.2. When a delay in conducting response activities will not compromise safety or
         increase risks, ensure protective measures are implemented until a mutually agreeable
         solution is reached.
         3.2.4.3. The environmental regulators or safety officials having serious concerns shall
         immediately elevate the concern to the next level of authority to attempt to achieve a
         mutually agreeable solution.
         3.2.4.4. Once an agreeable solution is attained, the appropriate DoD authority will
         coordinate EOD's support to resolve the emergency in a manner protective of human
         health and the environment, and that is consistent with EOD procedures.
    3.2.5. Response Records. Flights will ensure EOD response records and a copy of any
    supporting documentation such as an emergency permit (if issued) are entered into the
    EODIMS database. 7 HQ AFCESA/CEXD manages the EODIMS per Air Force Records

  NOTE: Under 40 CFR §264.1(g)(8)(iv), the responding military emergency response specialists’ unit must retain
records for 3 years identifying the dates of the response, the responsible persons within the unit involved, the type
and description of material addressed, and its disposition. The DoD Military Munitions Response Program requires

    Information Management System (AFRIMS) Table 33-49, Rule 20.01. All requests for
    EODIMS data-pulls will be submitted directly to HQ AFCESA/CEXD. EODIMS requests
    from United States Army Corps of Engineers representatives in support of
    remediation/recovery operations (Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP)) can come
    direct to HQ AFCESA/CEXD or through the units respective MAJCOM with the official
    USACE e-mail of the project representative requesting information. Requests from a
    contract-company or individual e-mail address should be submitted as a Freedom of
    Information Act (FOIA) request.
    3.2.6. (Added-AFGSC) Additional instructions on the disposition of munitions.
         3.2.6.1. (Added-AFGSC) Unique Military Items. Treat foreign munitions or explosives
         of unknown hazard/class division as HC/D 1.1L. If local munitions personnel or EOD
         teams can identify “found on base” items sufficiently to determine that it is the same as
         stock listed, hazard classified items, they have the prerogative to store it in a segregated
         area within the munitions storage area. Items that cannot be sufficiently identified will be
         treated as a level 1 or level 2 incident IAW the Military Munitions Rule. (T-1)
         3.2.6.2. (Added-AFGSC) Antique U.S. Military Items. These are still considered
         military munitions and will be managed as such. Munitions that can be correlated to a
         U.S. stock list number will be picked up on record by the Munitions Storage Area and an
         Ammunition Destruction Report will be processed through OO-ALC/LIW, Hill AFB.
         3.2.6.3. (Added-AFGSC) Military munitions used in training are not considered solid
         waste; dud-fired ground-blast simulator (GBS) and smoke grenades are treated as Level 1
         emergencies the same as other UXO. Dud-fired GBS and smoke grenades used during
         on-base exercises will be removed and destroyed as quickly as safely possible, without
         delay. (T-1)
         3.2.6.4. (Added-AFGSC) Non-Military or Non-Stock-Listed Munitions. If a non-
         military or non-stock-listed munition is found on base and is determined by the
         responding EOD team as “safe to move” and “temporarily hold” while waiting for
         destruction coordination (emergency permit), the EOD specialist will annotate the
         munition as “IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT RESPONSE
         (Level 2)” on the FOB turn-in document. (T-2) The munitions activity or EOD will
         immediately request for necessary permits. (T-2) See AFI 21-201, Conventional
         Munitions Maintenance Management, for specific procedures regarding denial of permit
         from federal, state and/or local authorities.
         3.2.6.5. (Added-AFGSC) Munitions inspection personnel will determine if the item is
         comparable to a stock listed item. (T-3) If the item is comparable to stock listed military
         munitions, the item will be picked up on record by the MSA and an ADR processed
         through OO-ALC/LIW, Hill AFB.
         3.2.6.6. (Added-AFGSC) Ball-type ammunition .50 caliber and smaller is not
         considered reactive by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and will not be
         treated as a reactive hazardous waste.

DoD lands to the public.
AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                            41


      3.2.6.7. (Added-AFGSC) Do not take possession of commercial fireworks. EOD
      should not bring confiscated, damaged, found, etc., commercial fireworks onto the
      installation for any reason, including emergency destruction. (T-1) EOD teams are
      recommended to advise only; allow all emergency actions to be accomplished by local
      authorities if at all possible. See AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards, para 7.22.
      3.2.7. Refer to AFI 21-201, paragraph 3.12.1, for disposition of munitions.
3.3. Contingency, Exercise, and Deployment (CED) Support.
   3.3.1. EOD Capability.
      3.3.1.1. The four elements required to provide a combat EOD capability are:
          3.3.1.1.1. Transportation and specialized equipment sets.
          3.3.1.1.2. Explosives and demolition material.
          3.3.1.1.3. Joint-service technical data and viewing/communications set.
          3.3.1.1.4. EOD-qualified personnel/teams.
      3.3.1.2. EOD UTCs must have the capability to be fully mobile on initial deployment
      into any contingency. This requires vehicles to be part of EOD equipment UTCs so that
      all equipment and explosives can be loaded on a vehicle for transport. An EOD capability
      does not exist without the ability to respond with necessary equipment, communications,
      and explosives.
   3.3.2. Core Unit Type Code (UTC). The AF uses EOD UTCs in peace and war to provide
   COCOMs with an EOD capability. The WMP-1 provides details of required UTCs, support-
   levels, and structure for differing threat-levels. Flights should request current copies of the
   WMP-1, Annex S, Appendix 9 (EOD) from their wing level A5 or MAJCOM representative.
      3.3.2.1. Each UTC has Mission Capability Statements (MISCAP) that provide UTC
      limitations and capabilities (available on the AF EOD Program Management CoP at
      https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-CE-49 or the
      Civil         Engineer         Expeditionary       Engineering     CoP       at
      https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=21340).
      3.3.2.2. Core UTCs are designated as Lead and Base support. A Lead UTC can support
      one lead flying squadron for 24-hour operations without augmentation. Base-support
      UTCs augment additional missions and other non-tactical or notional requirements.
   3.3.3. Joint EOD Operations.
      3.3.3.1. Refer to Joint service EOD Multi-service, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
      (MTTP), for the EOD Planning Checklist for Joint Operations
      3.3.3.2. A theater combat mission may best be supported by a joint EOD structure.
      Details for supporting joint EOD operations are in AF Tactics, Techniques, and
      Procedures (Interservice) (AFTTP(I)) 3-2.32, MTTP for EOD in a Joint Environment.
   3.3.4. Employing/deploying recently graduated EOD Personnel.
      3.3.4.1. EOD Apprentices (AFSC 3E831) are not deployment-eligible unless they have
      completed all requirements per paragraph 3.9.3.1.1.
 42                                             AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


          3.3.4.1.1. EOD Journeymen and Craftsmen will not be tasked to train our 3-level
          Airmen while directly supporting combat operations. To do so places our junior
          Airmen and the entire EOD team at increased risk of injury/loss of life.
          3.3.4.1.2. When possible, EOD Apprentices will be employed at locations with less
          risk where EOD persons with more developed experience and skills can train them
          prior to being assigned to locations of higher intensity.
      3.3.4.2. After graduation from EOD basic school, an EOD Officer (AFSC 32E H) is not
      deployment-eligible until they have been cleared by their Sq commander and MFM to
      deploy.

Section 3B—EOD Missions

3.4. Mission Areas.
3.4. (AFGSC)Mission Areas. Note: Flights will develop and use the following team leader
response guides: Chemical/Biological (wartime defense and peacetime operations), Nuclear,
Conventional, IED, WMD, Aircraft and Mobility. (T-2) These guides will contain safety
briefings which include all applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
programs, i.e., BBP, Respiratory Protection Program, as required. (T-2)
   3.4.1. Aerospace Vehicle Launch and Recovery. Supporting sortie generation and Space
   operations by responding to airfield emergencies to render safe ordnance and aircraft during
   in-flight and ground emergencies or crash situations.
      3.4.1.1. EOD personnel are not end-of-runway crews; however, they should be familiar
      with communicating with and operating around running fixed-wing and rotary-winged
      aircraft. Periodic (annual) training with these crews can be beneficial experience for EOD
      personnel.
      3.4.1.2. EOD teams respond when End-of-Runway crews or transient alert personnel are
      unavailable and/or when the aircraft/munitions system is in a hazardous condition.
      3.4.1.3. Refer to EOD Aerospace Vehicle CONOPS for more details.
   3.4.2. Force Protection. Eliminating or mitigating explosive hazards created by known or
   suspected criminal and terrorist devices.
      3.4.2.1. EOD teams do not perform searches in support of bomb-threats.
      3.4.2.2. Use diagnostics and remote procedures first: Hand-entry is a last resort.
      3.4.2.3. Use all available protective gear (e.g., bomb suit).
      3.4.2.4. Refer to the IED CONOPS for more details.
   3.4.3. Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). Providing full-spectrum response capability to
   nuclear, biological, chemical, radiological, incendiary, conventional EO and IEDs. EOD
   teams respond during the crisis management phase of the incident and provide: initial
   response; situational analysis; advise command authorities on hazards and protective
   measures; and support regional/specialized support teams as required. Refer to the WMD
   CONOPS for more details.
AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                         43


  3.4.4. Nuclear Weapon Incident/Accident. Providing immediate initial support to nuclear
  weapon incidents/accidents. This section outlines service component requirements in DoDD
  3150.2, DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program.
  3.4.4. (AFGSC) Note: AFGSC EOD flights will respond in support of the RTF. (T-0)
  Taskings will be on a notional basis. Flights must ensure team leader response guide clearly
  states confirmation of weapons permanent markings and weapons status for all weapon
  systems. (T-2)
     3.4.4.1. All AD AF EOD flights maintain qualification to provide emergency nuclear
     support. Flight personnel maintain technical data and are trained to perform those actions
     necessary to stabilize an incident site.
     3.4.4.2. Flights that support assigned nuclear weapons maintain technical data and are
     qualified in all aspects of assigned weapon systems (see paragraph 3.12.5).
  3.4.5. Unexploded Explosive Ordnance (UXO) Recovery Operations. Clearing UXO during
  runway and airbase recovery operations and neutralizing hazards from explosive-related
  incidents, which, because of unusual circumstances, present a threat to operations,
  installations, personnel or material. See UXO-related mission details under paragraphs 3.1
  and 3.2.
  3.4.6. Operational Range Clearance, Other-than Operational Range Support, and Non-
  emergency Requests for Demolition Support to MMRP Operations. The following
  paragraphs outline policy and procedures for EOD support to operational ranges, other-than
  operational range support, and non-emergency requests for demolition support to MMRP
  operations.
     3.4.6.1. Operational Range Clearance Support. Working together with range
     management offices and environmental agencies to clear operational ranges and test and
     evaluation ranges. This section outlines service component (EOD) requirements of
     DoDD 3200.16, Operational Range Clearance and DoDD 4140.62, Management and
     Disposition of Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH). Further
     implementing guidance is provided in AFI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations and
     the EOD Range CONOPS (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/DocView.asp?DocID=1113486).
         3.4.6.1.1. Practices for UXO clearance at operational ranges are different from those
         for environmental UXO remediation, and more closely mirror combat EOD duties
         and provides war skills experience for EOD operations. As in combat UXO area
         clearance, peacetime range clearance is usually only a surface clearance. At
         operational test and evaluation ranges, there are requirements for the sub-surface
         recovery of (sometimes deeply buried) experimental ordnance.
     3.4.6.2. Other-than Operational Range Support.
         3.4.6.2.1. EOD flights will not normally perform nor are they responsible for
         activities outside the scope of AFI 13-212 in relation to any range or other munitions
         response site. The AF EOD program is neither equipped, trained, nor manned for
         environmental requirements-based munitions response operations.

     3.4.6.2.2. Non-emergency or planned support on other than operational ranges is
     outside the scope of core competencies for EOD personnel. The below listed duties
     are examples of tasks EOD personnel should not be responsible for:
        3.4.6.2.2.1. Third-party quality assurance evaluations of contracts.
        3.4.6.2.2.2. Natural & cultural environmental escorts.
        3.4.6.2.2.3. Research and provide ordnance information (other than emergency
        response).
        3.4.6.2.2.4. Construction support.
        3.4.6.2.2.5. Sub-surface UXO recovery (e.g., area remediation that is not in
        support of ordnance RDT&E/Operational Training and Exercise (OT&E)).
        3.4.6.2.2.6. Contract oversight.
        3.4.6.2.2.7. Lend-lease-grant final land clearance subsequent to land use by
        commercial ventures.
        3.4.6.2.2.8. Final land-surveys required prior to closure or re-characterization of
        operational ranges.
     3.4.6.2.3. MAJCOM EOD staffs may authorize performance of the above tasks for
     unique individual situations/operations when it provides a warskills benefit.
     Parameters should be established in a supplement to this AFI and in individual
     memorandums between the contract executing agent, flight involved, and MAJCOM
     EOD staff. Courtesy copy HQ AFCESA/CEXD on such memoranda.
        3.4.6.2.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC/A7XE is responsible for all EOD actions
        necessary to survey, remediate and certify excess property under the control of
        this command IAW AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property. The decision to use
        active duty personnel or civilian contractors will be made by AFGSC/A7XE
        based on current command workload and specific aspects of the property in need
        of certification. AFGSC/A7XE will:

        3.4.6.2.5. EOD flights will provide a one-time response to first found munitions or
        other emergency support as outlined in a MAJCOM EOD staff-coordinated
        memorandum of agreement (MOA) or other coordinating document. The MOA will
        include as a minimum a request to provide full support and the required amount of
        resources (equipment, explosives, personnel, time). Also consider the following:
            3.4.6.2.5.1. Specific responsibilities provided. (EPA permits, security, medical
            etc.)
            3.4.6.2.5.2. Specific responsibilities/duties military is to perform/conduct.
            3.4.6.2.5.3. Support provided under immediate response authority should be
            provided on a cost-reimbursable basis, where appropriate or legally required.
     3.4.6.3. Non-emergency Requests for Demolition Support to MMRP Operations. EOD
     flights will not support non-emergency MMRP operations unless they are pre-
     coordinated with the EOD flight and MAJCOM EOD functional manager as outlined
     below.
        3.4.6.3.1. EOD Flights and MAJCOM EOD staffs will give consideration to MMRP
        demolition support that is within, or contiguous to, the installation. The decision to
        support these operations will be measured against current manning, upcoming
        deployments, operations, formal/core proficiency training, exercises, TDY schedules,
        and demolition explosives availability.
        3.4.6.3.2. EOD support is limited only to the destruction by demolition of
        unexploded military ordnance located on the surface of the ground. EOD teams will
        not assist in the investigation of subsurface anomalies identified by geological
        equipment regardless of the number of anomalies at the munitions response site
        (MRS).
        3.4.6.3.3. When installation EOD units are performing demolition support during
        MMRP projects on an “as needed” basis the MMRP project will be liable for
        damages resulting from the EOD demolition actions if the EOD unit takes precautions
        per applicable technical data but incidental property damage occurs. This includes
        but is not limited to facilities, equipment, or vehicles in the area.
        3.4.6.3.4. The MMRP project should reimburse installation EOD units for all assets
        consumed (explosives, equipment, etc.) and appropriate labor costs for EOD support
        to MMRP projects are reimbursable.
        3.4.6.3.5. If the EOD flight and MAJCOM determine that MMRP demolition support
        can be provided an MOA between AFCEE/ER and the installation will be developed
        to outline areas where the EOD unit can best support the customer and functional
        areas. AFCEC/CXR will assist with the development of the MOA. All MOAs
        regarding EOD demolition support to MMRP must be coordinated with AFCEC/CXR
        prior to implementation.
  3.4.7. Mortuary Services. Removal of ordnance left on or embedded in casualties. See
  paragraph 3.5.2 and the Mortuary Support CONOPS for more details.

  3.4.8. Federal Agency and Civil Authority Support. Assisting Federal and civil authorities
  with terrorist or other criminal acts, accidents, found explosive items, and other requests for
  support.
     3.4.8.1. See Chapter 7 for detailed guidelines on general support to civil authorities.
     3.4.8.2. 14 DELETED.
         3.4.8.2.1. Reimbursement for VIPPSA support. Public Law 94-524, Presidential
         Protection Act of 1996, establishes the authority for non-reimbursable DoD support to
         the USSS for protection of the President, Vice-President, or other officer immediately
         next in order of succession to the office of the President. Lack of funding is not a
         reason for non-support of Presidential and Vice- presidential protective mission
         taskings. All other VIPPSA taskings are reimbursable (see paragraph 3.4.8.2.6).
             3.4.8.2.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Missions that are JEODVIPPSA-funded will be
             processed through the Defense Travel System (DTS).
         3.4.8.2.2. If the personnel are available without impacting the flight’s ability to
         perform its primary mission, then a VIPPSA tasking must be supported. (See
         paragraph 1.9.3.2 to determine availability of personnel.)
         3.4.8.2.3. Coordinating Support. US Northern Command (US NORTHCOM) is
         designated as the executive agent for all VIPPSA taskings from the Office of the
         Secretary of Defense (OSD), USSS, or DOS. They task and coordinate all missions
         by DoD EOD personnel, regardless of service affiliation, through the
         USNORTHCOM JEODVIPPSA.
         3.4.8.2.3. (AFGSC) Note: JEODVIPPSA Tasking.              Airmen within 90-days of
         deploying should not be tasked.
         3.4.8.2.4. NSSE are sourced by NORTHCOM through JEODVIPPSA.
             3.4.8.2.4.1. JEODVIPPSA provides HQ AFCESA/CEXD and AFNORTH the
             AF fair share (approximately 30%) of joint tasking requirements.
             3.4.8.2.4.2. AFNORTH, in coordination with HQ AFCESA/CEXD, establishes
             MAJCOM distribution of the requirement and provides to AFNORTH who
             coordinates the required support with the MAJCOMs, consolidates the team
             information, and provides the consolidated roster to JEODVIPPSA, AF/A7CXR
             and HQ AFCESA/CEXD.
             3.4.8.2.4.3. (Added-AFGSC) USNORTHCOM taskings will come from
             AFCEC through AFGSC/A7XE who, in-turn, will task EOD flights based on
             team availability. AFGSC/A7XE will provide tasking information by phone,
             followed by an e-mail tasking message to the flight, due to time sensitivity. EOD
             Team Leader requirement will be IAW DoD VIPPSA Operations Plan.
         3.4.8.2.5. Approval Authority. Approval authority rests with the MAJCOM EOD
         functional manager. Approval for ANG EOD support, before mobilization, rests with
         the individual state adjutant general.
         3.4.8.2.6. Travel Vouchers. See EOD CoP site for instructions for mailing
         reimbursable Travel Vouchers (other than Presidential/Vice-Presidential).

               3.4.8.2.11. EOD personnel receive a civilian clothing allowance while supporting
               USSS or DoD missions. AFI 36-3014, Clothing Allowance for Air Force Personnel,
               specifies authorized amounts, how to apply, and how to get reimbursement. Flight
               chiefs selecting personnel for sup-port missions should first consider sending
               individuals already receiving a civilian clothing allowance.8
               3.4.8.2.12. EOD personnel supporting VIPPSA Presidential or Vice Presidential
               taskings do not fall under the Presidential Support Program, unless such support
               exceeds 180 continuous days. (See DoDD 5210.55, and AFI 31-501, Personnel
               Security Program Management.)
               3.4.8.2.13. EOD Credentials, Pins, and HDCM Manuals. JEODVIPPSA issues DD
               Form 2335, EOD Identification Card/Credentials, and identification pins to qualified
               EOD personnel performing VIPPSA support. HDCM Manuals are issued to EOD
               flights.
                    3.4.8.2.13.1. Credentials. Unless otherwise directed by HQ AFCESA/CEXD or
                    JEODVIPPSA, all EOD Credential requests will be initiated within the VIPPSA

           pins, credentials, and manuals in their possession semiannually (Jan/July) by
           using EODIMS VIPPSA Module.
              3.4.8.2.13.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC/A7XE will consolidate USSS
              credential, pin and HDCM inventory using EODIMS program semiannually
              (Jan/July) and submit to JEODVIPPSA.
           3.4.8.2.13.5. Due to the access a pin affords the bearer, do not use or carry them
           except while supporting a VIPPSA mission. During the mission, do not leave
           credentials or pins unattended in hotel rooms. Keep them in your possession at all
           times.
           3.4.8.2.13.6. Immediately report lost DD Form(s) 2335, identification pins or
           HDCM manuals to VIPPSA IAW instructions in the HDCM manual.
              3.4.8.2.13.6.1. (Added-AFGSC) The flight leader will investigate credential
              misuse and submit a written report to AFGSC/A7XE within 30 days of the
              incident. (T-2) Misuses of pins or credentials are grounds for removal from
              VIP support missions and UCMJ actions.
        3.4.8.2.14. The AF EOD standard for VIPPSA availability is based upon the
        following parameters:
           3.4.8.2.14.1. Flight Manning. Flight manning dedicated to installation support
           cannot drop below the following personnel limits: 6 personnel for standard flight
           manning structure, 8 personnel for direct support units, and 20 personnel for large
           range bases (see paragraph 1.9.3.2.1).
           3.4.8.2.14.2. PCS/Deployments. Flights will not consider personnel as available
           for VIPPSA taskings within 30 days of PCS, separation/retirement, deployment or
           return from deployment (see paragraph 1.6.17.1, 3.10.1.1, and 3.10.3 and AFI 36-
           2110, paragraph 4.7.5.2). Authority to waive established TOS minimum is
           delegated to the unit commander provided it will not interfere with the Airman
           meeting RNLTD for a projected PCS or separation/retirement on the scheduled
           date.
           3.4.8.2.14.3. Mission Support. Flights shall not cancel EOD support to scheduled
           missions (see paragraph 1.6.17.2 and 1.6.17.5). [e.g., JPAC, operational range
           support, and/or flying missions]
           3.4.8.2.14.4. Formal EOD Training. Scheduled PME and formal EOD training
           classes (AIEDDs, JNEOD, AFNEC, ECAC, etc.) are not to be cancelled in order
           to accept additional VIPPSA missions. Flights shall forecast and fill SORTS
           requirements (e.g., Range Support Tasking (RST) and Silver Flag) as well as
           other EOD qualification and proficiency training schedules prior to volunteering
           for VIPPSA EEOB missions (see paragraph 1.6.17.3).
           3.4.8.2.14.5. Inspections, Exercises, and Local Requirements. MAJCOMs should

             provide guidance to their installations concerning the priority and/or ORM of
             MAJCOM and Wing activities (e.g., local inspections, exercises, and other
             ancillary training) and personnel leave with respect to VIPPSA taskings.
   3.4.9. Base Populace Training. Provide training as requested on ordnance hazards and
   recognition, mine awareness, terrorist bomb search procedures, and personnel protective
   measures. This includes an annual briefing to local Fire Fighters on ordnance hazards and
   precautions for munitions supported.
      3.4.9.1. AF EOR is taught via web-based training. EOD flights may provide other
      methods to supplement the AF EOR course; however, the web-based training is the
      mandatory basic course.
      3.4.9.2. Flights should use HQ AFCESA/CEXD-standardized informational
      training/briefings as a template for briefings on EOD mission capability, ordnance
      hazards and recognition, IED awareness, mine awareness, terrorist bomb search
      procedures, personnel protective measures, etc. These briefings are available on the AF
      EOD                 Program             Management                  CoP               at
      https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-CE-49.
      3.4.9.3. If EOD flights are requested to provide EOD-related briefings away from home
      station to national agencies (e.g., Bureau of Land Management (BLM), DTRA, EPA,
      TSWG, DoD, etc), other military services, HQ USAF or Secretary of the AF
      agencies/offices, the briefings should be coordinated with MAJCOM EOD staffs,
      AF/A7CXR and HQ AFCESA/CEXD prior to being briefed/released. This ensures a
      consistent and supported message is presented.
      3.4.9.4. EOD flights should support community outreach programs to educate both
      installation personnel and the surrounding public on the dangers of trespassing on ranges
      and the hazards associated with UXO.
          3.4.9.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) Offer and provide training to local law enforcement
          agencies on request. (T-3) Training should identify the capabilities of EOD flights
          and the limitations of utilizing military personnel for local, state and federal
          operations IAW DoD directives and environmental compliance requirements.
      3.4.9.5. (Added-AFGSC) Flights will maintain lesson plans as applicable for all
      explosive training to include outside agencies. (T-3)
3.5. Command Unique Missions.
   3.5.1. Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC). Refer to PACAF mission guidelines
   for details (HQ PACAF/A7XOM, DSN 449-2884).

   agencies.
      3.5.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) EOD Flights are frequently requested to provide support to
      other agencies for various test projects. Normal support consists of providing safe escort
      on ranges and disposal of explosive material on conclusion of the test. The agency
AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                             51


      requesting EOD support must provide funding, a test plan and coordinate requirements
      with the supporting EOD flight. Agencies requesting EOD support on weapons ranges
      should coordinate requirements through the installation’s Range Management Office.
      EOD flights will approve or disapprove the support request based on mission impact and
      personnel availability. (T-1) At least 30 days prior to the projected test date, the EOD
      flight must coordinate test and safety plans through the installation’s wing safety office to
      AFGSC/SEW and AFGSC/A7XE. (T-1) AFGSC/A7XE, in coordination with
      AFGSC/SEW, will review and provide final approval of the EOD-related portion of the
      tests and safety plans.
      3.5.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) During RT&D missions, EOD flights may be requested to
      use equipment, supplies and demolition material not approved by the NNMSB and or do
      not have approved technical data. Flights must develop and submit operating instructions
      and safety/test plans to AFGSC/A7XE at least 30 days prior to operations for approval.
      (T-1) Operating instructions must contain information required by AFMAN 91-201.
3.6. Incident Command System.
   3.6.1. AF Incident Management System (AFIMS).
      3.6.1.1. Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 directed the implementation of the
      NRF through the NIMS. The AF chose to develop the AFIMS for implementation of the
      NRF and the NIMS. In the AFIMS structure, EOD falls under Emergency Support
      Function (ESF) 5 and Operations Section for down range activities.
      3.6.1.2. The AFIMS replaces the Disaster Control Group and is outlined in AFI 10-2501,
      Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. All EOD
      managers and Team Leaders must be familiar with AFIMS.
3.7. Incident Reporting.
   3.7.1. Service EODIMS Incident Reporting.
      3.7.1.1. Do not enter Restricted Data into EODIMS. Refer to T.O. and paragraph
      numbers only.
      3.7.1.2. EOD flights will use the EODIMS Operations Module, Incident Reporting
      System to gather and report information regarding EOD operations to their respective
      MAJCOMs. Flights submit incident reports within 5 working days after response
      termination. (15 working days for EOD range clearance reports) The emergency status of
      the EODIMS report is category level two (C-2) and requires continued normal reporting
      during emergency conditions.
      3.7.1.3. Responding EOD teams will list the individual who positively identified the
      ordnance in the EODIMS incident report, the Team Leader will validate the
      identification. This process is accomplished using the drop down menus provided in the
      EODIMS. If the Team Leader is the one who identifies the ordnance a different EOD
      Team Member will verify and be listed on the EOD report (see paragraph 3.1.1).
      3.7.1.4. MAJCOM managers use EODIMS Incident Reports to analyze trends, identify
      deficiencies, plan training, and project future activities in all aspects of the EOD program.
      MAJCOMs will review and approve all EODIMS Incident Reports within 5 working
      days from date received from flights.

     3.7.1.5. Flights should avoid the use of “thermal treatment” and “disposal” (in relation to
     the emergency destruction of UXO and other hazardous explosive devices) in written
     EOD reports because the environmental interpretations of these terms have specific
     meaning and consequences under the RCRA that may impose additional requirements on
     the USAF.        The suitable language for EOD explosive operations includes:
     “destroy/destruction” or “detonate/detonation” or even “blown-in-place” (BIP).
     3.7.1.6. EODIMS shares response information (e.g., IED, post-blast, UXO, area
     clearance, etc) with the Joint Digital Information Gathering System (JDIGS) Program:
     this is covered in the EODIMS CONOPS.
  3.7.2. EOD Significant Event/Response Reporting. At times there are EOD response
  incidents that are significant enough to warrant immediate notification to the EOD flights
  MAJCOM and possibly the entire AF EOD community.
     3.7.2.1. To ensure reporting continuity the following guidelines are presented and must
     be followed when any of the following significant EOD emergency events result in:
         3.7.2.1.1. A inadvertent release of munitions from aircraft.
         3.7.2.1.2. Loss of life or lost time injury due to an EOD related event.
         3.7.2.1.3. Injury to EOD personnel occurred during the emergency operation.
         3.7.2.1.4. Adverse public reaction.
         3.7.2.1.5. Mutual aid responses that require extensive use of personnel or equipment
         to render safe or dispose of hazardous explosive item, assist in mass injury or casualty
         recovery, or have significant public impact potential.
     3.7.2.2. Initial Notification Methods: Within 6 hours of the beginning of a significant
     EOD emergency event, provide notification to AF/A7CXR, AFCESA/CEXD and
     Command EOD office by phone (after duty hours) or email (during duty hours). This
     COA was established by A7CX because of excessive delays between incident and
     reporting to the Civil Engineer (AF/A7C).
         3.7.2.2.1. During normal duty hours (0730-1600 Eastern Standard Time), the
         MAJCOM, Forward Operating Agency (FOA), or base EOD flight will up-channel
         information     by     email   (designate   as      high    importance)   to
         AFCEC.CXD.WorkFlow@Tyndall.AF.Mil. Attach the report generated by the
         EODIMS, if available. When email is not immediately available, summarize the
         report by phone to an AFCEC/CXD staff member at DSN or commercial number on
         the AF EOD Program Management CoP, using priority precedence.
         3.7.2.2.2. After normal duty hours (1600-0700 Eastern Standard Time), the
         MAJCOM, FOA, or base EOD office sends an email as indicated in 3.7.2.2., then
         summarizes the EOD report to a AFCESA/CEXD staff member using the division
         cell phone numbers posted on the AF EOD Program Management CoP.
         3.7.2.2.3. AFCESA/CEXD notifies AF/A7CX, of significant EOD events when
         appropriate.
     3.7.2.3. Interim Updates. The EOD Flight Chief ensures that the MAJCOM and an
     AFCESA/CEXD staff member are simultaneously notified of significant events in
AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                                            53


        progress for more than six hours, or when such events have not concluded within 12
        hours.
        3.7.2.4. Final Notification by Email. Within 12 hours following a significant EOD event,
        the EOD Flight Chief through the Base Civil Engineer (BCE), will coordinate an email
        and        forward        to     the       MAJCOM            EOD         office     and
        AFCEC.CXD.WorkFlow@Tyndall.AF.Mil. If possible, attach the complete EOD
        report to this email.
        3.7.2.5. Final Report. The EOD Flight Chief, will complete a report as stated in
        paragraph 3.7.1 through EODIMS.
     3.7.3. SORTS Report. SORTS is reported IAW AFI 10-201.
        3.7.3.1. It is the EOD flight management’s responsibility to ensure manpower,
        equipment and training status is updated in SORTS, normally on a monthly basis in
        coordination with the Emergency Management Flight, or whenever significant changes
        occur.
        3.7.3.2. Since the results of individual flight SORTS reports are visible at the Joint
        Service level, inputting data accurately is critical for high level decision making. EOD
        flights will have access to EOD IMS Resource Module and work closely with squadron
        SORTS monitor to correct inaccurate information.
        3.7.3.3. Descriptions should be detailed enough to identify what is missing/causing the
        rating, what needs to be done to fix or mitigate the problem, and a reasonable expected
        completion date.
     3.7.4. AEF Reporting Tool (ART).
        3.7.4.1. It is the EOD flight management’s responsibility to ensure ART accurately
        reflects status of UTCs. Review and make changes monthly or within 24 hours when
        status changes. AEF Center and MFM rely on the accuracy and currency of reporting to
        make critical AEF sourcing decisions.
             3.7.4.1.1. Code Green. Equipment – 100 percent of required equipment and vehicles
             are on hand. Personnel – All personnel are available/proficient with no rank/skill
             level substitutions.
             3.7.4.1.2. Code Yellow. Equipment – some equipment is missing but UTC can still
             accomplish its mission. Personnel – All personnel are available/proficient using
             allowable rank/skill level substitutions.10
             3.7.4.1.3. Code Red. Equipment – some or all of equipment is missing and the UTC
             cannot perform its mission. Personnel – Any position is vacant or any personnel lack
             proficiency per paragraph 1.8.2.
        3.7.4.2. All UTCs coded Yellow or Red will have comments explaining why their status
        is downgraded.


10
   NOTE: If 3-level substitutions are used the comments will indicate that they have completed their CDCs and core
5-level tasks in the CFETP.

Section 3C—EOD Training

3.8. Training Overview. The AF EOD Training Program aims to produce professional, highly
qualified, technically proficient EOD teams capable of safely and efficiently performing
peacetime and wartime EOD missions. EOD proficiency training enables EOD teams to achieve
and maintain a level of competency to safely and effectively deal with explosive hazards.
   3.8.1. Qualification Level. EOD team members must be trained to a knowledge level
   sufficient to determine and observe correct safety requirements needed before and during
   reconnaissance, and obtain the information necessary to positively identify ordnance items
   and formulate an appropriate render safe or disposal plan.
   3.8.2. Need for Practical Training. Hands-on practical training is necessary for required
   proficiency. EOD team members meet acceptable performance standards, through the use of
   applicable publications and training aids by correctly performing EOD procedures without
   committing errors that degrade safety and risk injury.
   3.8.3. Need for Training Devices: Maintain Sufficient US and Foreign Ordnance Training
   Devices to meet upgrade training and performance standards. Training aids should be of
   sufficient quantity and quality to perform technical evaluations. Training aids should have
   the ability to be monitored to indicate success or failure of employment of EOD procedures.
3.9. Training Responsibilities:
   3.9.1. HQ AFCESA/CEXD:
       3.9.1.1. Submits MAJCOM inputs to the EOD Standard Training Package.
       3.9.1.2. Oversees the development, updating, and publishing of the CFETP and Specialty
       Training Standard.
       3.9.1.3. Consolidates MAJCOM inputs to establish “Road-to-War” training packages in
       response to wartime/contingent needs.
       3.9.1.4. Oversees the EOD portion of Silver Flag, Combat Battlefield Ready Airman
       (CoBRA) and other functional contingency training programs; ensures compliance with
       COCOM, Joint Service Training Order (JSTO), and 2nd AF requirements for entry into
       combat theaters.
       3.9.1.5. Represents the EOD program at the Training Equipment Review Board (TERB)
       with 2nd AF, Army Division East and West, 1st Army and Air Forces Central (AFCENT).

       3.9.2.1. Recommend subject and task material in writing to HQ AFCESA/CEXD.
       3.9.2.2. Set up procedures to schedule, complete, and document training requirements.
       3.9.2.3. Request and manage quotas for EOD formal training courses.
       3.9.2.4. Monitor personnel attendance to ensure maximum course use and prevent lapses
       in individual certifications.
       3.9.2.5. Supplement the CFETP to include MAJCOM-unique requirements.
   3.9.3. EOD Flights.
AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                                 55


       3.9.3.1. Ensure deploying Airmen have completed all requirements per paragraph 3.3.4.
           3.9.3.1.1. An EOD Apprentice (AFSC 3E831) is not deployment-eligible unless they
           have completed all volumes of their CDC and the end-of-course (EOC) test, and have
           been trained and certified on 100-percent of core task items in the CFETP.
           3.9.3.1.2. EOD Officers initial qualification training includes Initial Job Qualification
           Standard (IJQS) for standby, equipment issue and familiarization, EOD flight
           operations, all Home Station Training (HST) (previously referred to as CAT 1 and
           CAT 2) requirements, all ancillary training, Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT)
           EOD Flight Management Course (or a MAJCOM orientation liaison), and selected
           reading as deemed necessary by the MAJCOM and local unit commanders. EOD
           officer technical competency is required to facilitate equal partnership in
           Joint/Coalition arenas and in the execution of their daily duties. In order to garner an
           equal footing, USAF EOD qualified officers should complete all local IJQS tasks.
       3.9.3.2. Schedule, conduct, and document all required and optional training.11
       3.9.3.3. Ensure that Airmen recently graduated from the Naval EOD Basic Course
       dedicate daily study-time to complete CDCs during duty hours, when possible,
       3.9.3.4. Flight management must evaluate members returning from extended
       deployments (e.g., 179-day and longer) to ensure member’s proficiency on core tasks
       listed in the CFETP and IJQS are still current. If recertification on certain tasks is
       required, follow documentation procedures listed in the CFETP. Annotate AF IMT 623a,
       On the Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, in the Air Force Training Record
       (AFTR) that this review was accomplished.
       3.9.3.5. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC EOD Flight Leader:
           3.9.3.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) Ensure Airmen providing manning assistance complete
           all necessary practical or classroom training to prepare an individual to perform
           required EOD duties at their assigned temporary duty location. (T-1)
           3.9.3.5.2. (Added-AFGSC) Ensure a comprehensive training program is in effect
           and training priorities are clearly defined. (T-1) Wartime, as well as peacetime tasks,
           must be continually taught, exercised and evaluated to ensure the highest level of
           competency. (T-1)
           3.9.3.5.3. (Added-AFGSC) EOD training will be prioritized above normal day-to-
           day work activities and additional duties/volunteer activities. Only EOD operations;
           i.e., incident responses, range clearances, JEODVIPPSA missions, etc., will receive a
           higher priority than training.
           3.9.3.5.4. (Added-AFGSC) TDY manning assistance personnel will participate in
           the recurring training given at the TDY location to the greatest extent possible. (T-2)
           The person’s TDY supervisor or the flight training NCO will record all training
           received by the individual at the TDY location. (T-2)

11
  NOTE: AFI 10-2501. AF Emergency Management Program Planning and Operations, paragraph 6.6.1.4 EOD
proficiency training duplicates most CBRNE Defense course material. EOD personnel need to receive CBRNE
Defense training only on CBRNE threat-specific defense procedures.
 56                                             AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


           3.9.3.5.5. (Added-AFGSC) Ensure all members receive an initial evaluation within
           60 days of assignment to the EOD flight and are task-qualified on all locally
           supported munitions and procedures and placed on stand-by duty within 120 days for
           normal routine stand-by/conventional responses and 180 days for direct
           support/nuclear-related training requirements. (T-2) When the member completes all
           stand-by certification requirements, document the individual’s AF Form 623a, On-
           the-Job Training Record – Continuation Sheet, with the following statement:
           “Member has met all requirements to perform stand-by duties.” (T-3) The member
           and supervisor will sign and date the entry. (T-3) Flights may have individuals pull
           conventional stand-by prior to being fully qualified on the nuclear specific IJQS
           items. If additional time is required, a waiver will be routed through AFGSC/A7XE
           for concurrence. (T-3) The delayed qualification will document the rationale and the
           waiver request will be added in the individuals AF Form 623a. (T-3)
           3.9.3.5.6. (Added-AFGSC) Plan and budget to send 5/7-level trainees to participate
           in ARC operations (minimum of 2 weeks) in conjunction with upgrade training. (T-
           3)
3.10. Road to War (RTW) Training. Contingency operations have significantly changed the
way EOD is employed in ground tactical environments and highlights the importance of a robust
and comprehensive predeployment training continuum for EOD operators. During sustained
operations, MAJCOM Flight training programs will institute a RTW training philosophy (30-60
days) that focuses the Airman’s attention on contingency tasks and necessary skills to operate in
the stressful and arduous environments of outside-the-wire operations.
   3.10.1. General RTW Guidance. To institute a flight notional RTW continuum HAF/A7CXR
   and HQ AFCESA/CEXD recommend the following guidance:
       3.10.1.1. Upon entering a RTW training window (30-60 days from deployment), the
       member’s priority is to train for the location they are deploying to. It is imperative that
       an EOD flights SIPRNET be active, current and functional since much of the information
       needed will be posted on the SIPR. As a minimum the EOD member will:
           3.10.1.1.1. Review EODIMS, JEODTSC and intelligence web sites for information
           as it relates to specific Area of Operations (AO) threats.
           3.10.1.1.2. Request theater specific EOD Intel products from local Intel
           organizations. (AFI 14-119)
       3.10.1.2. EOD Airmen should not volunteer for VIPPSA (includes EEOB) or RST
       (range support to other bases) taskings during this period. (See ARC exception in pre
       deployment line remarks.) This does not exempt Airmen from downward directed
       MAJCOM taskings for VIPPSA or RST missions.
       3.10.1.3. Miscellaneous TDYs that do not contribute to upgrade training or PME should
       not be supported. (PME and 7-level craftsman course must be accomplished if
       scheduled.) Observer/Controller (OC) support to Silver Flag is an acceptable tasking
       during RTW training.
   3.10.2. Combat Battlefield Ready Airman (CoBRA) Silver Flag Exercise Site (SFES). The
   CoBRA course is the most critical phase in the RTW training process to transform our
AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                         57


   Airmen from “Service Support” to “Battlefield Airmen” able to support both the Air
   Component and Joint Force Commanders. It brings individuals and teams together to form a
   unit prior to deploying into a high risk combat environment.
   3.10.3. Notional RTW Continuum. The RTW concept may be 30 to 90 days duration
   depending on necessary training. MAJCOM RTW programs need to include, as a minimum,
   the following:
       3.10.3.1. Troop Leading Procedures
       3.10.3.2. Level B Code of Conduct
       3.10.3.3. Weapons Tactics Course (2-weeks) in all assigned weapons
       3.10.3.4. HQ AFCESA/CEXD Computer Based Training (CBT) (highly encouraged):
          3.10.3.4.1. Large Range Disposal
          3.10.3.4.2. IED Electronics
          3.10.3.4.3. Homemade Explosives (HME)
          3.10.3.4.4. Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT)
          3.10.3.4.5. Communications/Radios
          3.10.3.4.6. Explosive Entry Tools (EET)
          3.10.3.4.7. Aircraft CBTs (applicable to deploying mission)
       3.10.3.5. Robot Simulator (Mk 1/2)
       3.10.3.6. Land Navigation/Map Reading
       3.10.3.7. Physical Fitness
   3.10.4. Evasion and Conduct after Capture (ECAC) Attendance Requirements: All EOD
   Airmen are required to attend AETC's ECAC course. ECAC is a 4-day Survival, Evasion,
   Resistance, and Escape (SERE) course specifically targeted for Airmen who's duties place
   them at increased risk of isolation or capture, but who are not required to attend C-level
   SERE training IAW AFI 16-1301.
3.11. Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) 3E8X1. The CFETP 3E8X1 is a
comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training
requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the EOD
career field. Document CDC progression and formal training in IMT 623 section III.
   3.11.1. Group I – Monthly Qualification Training. Training or operations using cartridge-
   actuated tools, demolition explosives, or pyrotechnic devices to perform RSP or general
   demolition.
       3.11.1.1. Monthly use of live explosives is required for EOD qualification of Hazardous
       Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP) for demolition duty IAW DoD Financial Management
       Regulation, Volume 7a, (Chapter 24, section 2404).
          3.11.1.1.1. Either training (per paragraph 3.11.1) or actual explosives operations
          (e.g., emergency responses, combat operations, experimentation & testing, munitions
58                                             AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


         disposal, etc) fulfill the requirement for HDIP for demolition duty, as long as live
         explosives are used.
         3.11.1.1.2. Document HDIP monthly qualifications in the AFTR or similar product.
         3.11.1.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) The flight leader will review monthly incentive pay
         qualification in Group I and other monthly training, verify all information is correct
         and sign appropriate documents. (T-3)

                                      LOGISTICS / A4

4.1. Overview. The Equipment Supply Listing (ESL) identifies Base Support and EOD
mobility equipment required to support home-station, contingency, and operational plans. HQ
AFCESA/CEXD publishes and distributes to MAJCOMs for implementation. MAJCOMs must
use this document when determining equipment requirements for their flights. The mobility
ESLs identifies SORTS reportable equipment.
4.2. Equipment Supply Listings (ESL). MAJCOMs/Flights must adhere to the ESL
requirements to standardize equipment throughout the AF EOD program. ESLs are available on
the         AF           EOD           Program         Management         CoP            at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-CE-49.
   4.2.1. Equipment Status. Flights must properly maintain and account for all assigned
   equipment and accurately track the status of all ESL equipment requirements.
       4.2.1.1. Inventory. All ESL equipment requirements must be on-hand or on-order and
       tracked according to individual MAJCOM or local procedures.
          4.2.1.1.1. Flights will maintain a monitoring system that tracks all on-hand shelf-life
          items for continuous replacement.
          4.2.1.1.2. For items that cannot be ordered due to a legitimate constraint (funding,
          procurement issues, etc), every effort expended to resolve the issue will be
          documented and tracked through to completion IAW with MAJCOM or local
          procedures.
          4.2.1.1.3. For common readily available shelf life items that have short expiration
          dates, flights may forgo procurement until deployment tasking is received. Flights
          must ensure resources have funds and locations are pre-identified where to purchase
          items in the local market to ensure item fills meet DOC timelines.
       4.2.1.2. Maintenance: All ESL required equipment will be serviceable. If an item is
       unserviceable, every effort to resolve the issue will be documented and tracked through to
       completion IAW MAJCOM or local procedures.
       4.2.1.3. Individual Equipment Accountability. All EOD personal retention items
       identified in the EOD Individual Equipment ESL will be requisitioned, managed and
       accounted for through the BAMS. BAMS will be the tool units use to account for non-
       returnable items during PCS transfers, separations, and retirements.
       4.2.1.4. Accountable Equipment. All items on the ESL with an Allowance Source Code
       (ASC) will be placed on the Custodian Account & Custodian Request Log (CA-CRL) (R-
       14) per AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Chapter 22. ASCs are identified on each
       ESL for equipment items.
       4.2.1.5. Unit Supply Accounts. EOD flights must maintain an equipment, munitions,
       supply, and weapons accounts IAW AF guidance and local directives.
 72                                              AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


   4.2.2. Reporting Equipment Status. Flights must accurately report UTC/ESL equipment
   status.
       4.2.2.1. SORTS/ART: Flights must report respective equipment status utilizing both the
       SORTS Report and the AEF Reporting Tool IAW paragraph 3.7.3 and 3.7.4.
       4.2.2.2. Strategic Equipment Reporting Tool (SERT). The reporting tool (formally
       known as the 180-day report) encompasses all Depot-funded and key EOD equipment
       assets. MAJCOMs will coordinate with subordinate units to complete inventories.
       Information required includes; all serial numbers, complete account number with detail
       numbers, requisition numbers for all shortages and provide serviceability status. Ensure
       units capture actions taken to obtain repairs/replacements for unserviceable assets in the
       remarks section. Flights will accurately maintain their respective equipment status and
       update the SERT as necessary when changes occur. MAJCOMS will consolidate their
       respective units’ information and place the document on the AF EOD Program
       Management CoP in the MAJCOMS Staff Only/AF EOD Equipment Inventory folder.
       HQ AFCESA/CEXD consolidates MAJCOM inputs for use during the POM Build and
       Munitions Buy Budget process.
           4.2.2.2.1. Use. The SERT will provide HAF, HQ AFCESA/CEXD, and MAJCOMs
           the capability to assess current capabilities, assist with AF audits, POM Build and
           Munitions Buy Budget process and conduct Command Purchase of EOD equipment.
           The SERT is the only means available to identify unserviceable equipment. The data
           will enable agencies to identify status and negative trends to advocate for funds for
           repair budgets and contracts. This report can also be utilized by flights as a continuity
           tool to extract key equipment status data.
   4.2.3. UTC/ESL Updates. To ensure standardization of EOD equipment and supplies,
   recommended changes to any part of the ESL must have the concurrence of EOD EWG
   members and be approved by HQ AFCESA/CEXD. (Up to the monetary limits set by the
   EESPG.) Major ESL changes (those that modify the capability of a UTC) should be reviewed
   by the EODP. (Out-of-cycle if necessary.) The EODP can request the EWG to readdress an
   ESL issue.
   4.2.4. (Added-AFGSC) UTC packing list requirements.             AFI 10-403, Deployment
   Planning and Execution, requires packing lists to be placed in individual kits listing the
   contents. Air Force EOD UTC load planning fulfills this requirement with the use of the Air
   Force EOD Equipment and Supply Listing and Illustrated Parts Breakdowns (IPBs). Printed
   copies of pertinent ESL and/or IPB information will be placed on or within individual kits as
   required. (T-3)
4.3. Contingency and Emergency Response Vehicle Maintenance Priorities. EOD teams are
designated as first responders and are an integral part of the installations “sortie sustainment”.
Per AFI 24-302, Vehicle Maintenance (paragraph 3.32.5 and Table 2.2) EOD vehicles are
designated as Priority II Sortie Sustaining Vehicles and should receive a Priority II maintenance
and repair priority. EOD flights will coordinate with the installations Vehicle Maintenance
Squadron to ensure that their vehicles reflect the priority II rating in the installations Mission
Essential Levels (MELS) Listing.

                   STRATEGIC PLANS AND REQUIREMENTS / A5

5.1. AF Deliberate Planning.
   5.1.1. USAF War Mobilization Plan (WMP). The WMP is discussed in AFMAN 10-401,
   Operational Plan and Concept Plan Development and Implementation. The WMP is the
   principle AF document that feeds the joint-service planning system – specifically, the Joint
   Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP). The WMP is a five-volume AF document that provides
   Air Staff and USAF commanders with current policies, forces, and planning factors for
   conducting and supporting wartime operations. Volume 1 (WMP-1) is important for flights:
   WMP-1, Annex S, Appendix 9 outlines EOD wartime posturing, capability, and deliberate
   planning for worst-case scenarios. Flight managers should be familiar with EOD capabilities
   and the deliberate planning factors. Flights comply with paragraph 1.2.9 and 3.7.4 of this
   instruction to ensure correct UTC data is available for loading in the Time-Phased Force and
   Deployment Data (TPFDD) libraries.
      5.1.1.1. WMP-3, Part 2, is the list of combat and support forces, by UTC and location,
      available to the war-planners and COCOM. Flights comply with paragraph 3.7.3 of this
      instruction to ensure correctness of WMP-3, Part 2.
   5.1.2. DOC-Taskings. DOC-Taskings outline which OPlan flights are attached to, and the
   UTCs they are required to posture. (As well as SORTS and ART reporting requirements.)
5.2. Wing/Installation Contingency and Support Plans.
   5.2.1. Review Plans. Review Wing/Installation Contingency and Support Plans annually.
   These plans are normally available through Wing Plans (XP or A5) office.
   5.2.2. Garrison Expeditionary Support Plans (GESP). Every base has this plan. Ensure EOD
   requirements are listed in this plan. It explains the Ready Augmentee Program requirements,
   vehicle needs, and other parameters of support.
   5.2.3. Emergency Management (EM) Planning. EM planning is covered in AFI 10-2501, Air
   Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. EOD flights use
   EM planning in addition to the EOD mission CONOPS to assist in developing Team Leader
   guides for emergency response.
5.3. Plan Sourcing Procedures.
   5.3.1. UTC Availability. EOD Flight Chief in conjunction with the Unit Deployment
   Manager (UDM) will update ART and SORTS IAW local procedures and AFI 10-210.
   5.3.2. Deployed TOs. Deployed teams must coordinate with theater EOD functional with the
   number of TO sets dispatched so TO distribution can be identified at the deployed base.
   Gaining MAJCOMs will coordinate with Detachment 63 and HQ AFCESA/CEXD so that
   the deployed team can receive a new TODO account. HQ AFCESA/CEXD will establish a
   new flight within EODIMS.

6.3. Communication Security (COMSEC). EOD flights must have COMSEC accounts for
management of secure communications and navigational Aides.
6.4. Satellite Communications. Prior to acquisition, coordinate satellite communications
terminal purchases with MAJCOM EOD functional management, HQ AFCESA/CEXD, and the
local communications squadron to ensure equipment interoperability, frequency approval,
downlink support and satellite service access/availability.
6.5. Frequency Management. Flights and MAJCOMs must obtain radio frequency assignment
for EOD electronic tools (e.g., robots, remote firing devices, x-ray devices, etc) from base level
spectrum manager or the Air Force Frequency Management Agency (AFFMA). (DoDI 4650.1,
Policy and Procedures for Management and Use of the Electromagnetic Spectrum, and AFI 33-
118, Electromagnetic Spectrum Management.)
     6.5.1. Even if EOD electronic tools have prior joint-service or AF spectrum certification,
     flights must coordinate local equipment spectrum certification prior to equipment being
     placed in operation using DD Form 1494, Application for Equipment Frequency Allocation.15
     Be sure to plan for foreign frequency authorizations for potential forward deployed locations.
     6.5.2. Use of electronic attack equipment (e.g., Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised
     Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW)) requires frequency assignment for training,
     testing, and exercises. Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual (CJCSM) 3212.02C,
     Performing Electronic Attack in the United States and Canada for Tests, Training, and
     Exercises and DoDD 5101.14, DoD Executive Agent and Single Manager for Military
     Ground-Based Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare
     (CREW) Technology is the official guidance for frequency clearance procedures for
     performing electronic attack.

      site IAW AFMAN 91-201, Air Force Explosives Safety Standards. All inhabited and
      industrial work areas must be environmentally controlled.
   7.1.2. Spatial Requirements. Spatial requirements are based on AFMS and the Capabilities
   Based Manpower Determinants (CBMD), amount of assigned base support and DOC tasked
 76                                                  AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


       equipment and vehicles per AFMAN 32-1084, Facility Requirements, 20 Apr 12, paragraph
       2.4.2 Table 3.13.16
       7.1.3. Criteria, Applicability and Justification. EOD personnel provide a 24-hour CBRNE
       capability to aircraft recovery operations, explosives-related incidents, and weapons of mass
       destruction or other terrorist-related events. EOD personnel conduct extensive in-house
       proficiency training and provide base-populace training on EOR, IED, canine and vehicle
       search procedures, certification on use of pyrotechnics, explosives safety, and aircraft
       explosive hazard familiarization.
       7.1.4. Special Features. The EOD facility must meet requirements for storage of hazardous
       and explosive materials, classified information, and firearms according to DoD 6055.9-M
       (Volume 1 through 8), DoD Explosives Safety Standards, AFMAN 91-201, Air Force
       Explosives Safety Standards and other federal, state, and local laws. EOD facilities will
       maintain a SIPRNET/Secure Telephone Equipment (STE); Fax; DSN/Commercial/Fax lines;
       and LMR (base stations). Mobility and other flight general-purpose vehicles should be stored
       in a secure fenced in, covered, and lighted area. Equipment load out areas will also have
       sufficient lighting for safe load out of equipment. The EOD Proficiency Training Range is
       required under category code 831-173. Explosives will be stored according to DoD 6055.9-M
       (Volume 1-8) and AFMAN 91-201.

Section 7B—Federal and Civil Support

7.2. Installation Support to Off-Base EOD Response. As outlined in DoDD 2000.13, Civil
Affairs, this section provides EOD guidance to meet the life sustaining needs of the civilian
population and provide expertise to restore civilian sector functions. Installation Commanders
will evaluate and then commit as appropriate, available resources directly to requests from civil
authorities under circumstances requiring immediate response (para 2.12 & 3.4.5 of AFI 10-801).
       7.2.1. Support Staff. The installation commander or designee, a Public Affairs
       representative, and a Judge Advocate representative should accompany the EOD team to the
       location of the incident. However, emergency responses to potentially life-threatening
       emergencies will not be delayed awaiting legal reviews or unified media responses.
           7.2.1.1. The commander may designate the senior EOD team member as his
           representative pending determination of the need for additional support.
           7.2.1.2. The Public Affairs and Judge Advocate representatives may be in “on-call”
           status pending determination of the need for additional support.
       7.2.2. Risk Category. An incident risk category is assigned per AFJI-32-3002. Commanders
       must limit exposure of EOD personnel to risk of injury or loss of life unless the critical
       nature of the threat to the civilian population clearly justifies the risk. Base the risk decision
       on a joint assessment of the incident by the senior EOD representative and the incident
       commander.
       7.2.3. Response Parameters. See details for responding to military ordnance and to non-
       military devices/explosives in paragraph 3.1.4.

   7.2.4. Munitions Inerting. EOD is authorized to inert munitions only if required to support
   an official mission objective when AFMC or the System Program Office (SPO) cannot
   provide the support. The MAJCOM EOD staff must first approve any request for an inerting
   operation. EOD units will use the guidance for locally written procedures in AFMAN 91-
   201, USAF Explosives Safety Standards. The procedures to be used by AF EOD units must
   be, as a minimum, coordinated with base environmental, and Wing Safety, and approved by
   the squadron commander. Forward locally approved procedures to the MAJCOM EOD staff,
   who in turn will obtain MAJCOM/SEW concurrence/approval prior to beginning inerting
   operations.
7.3. EOD Assistance to Civil Authorities.
   7.3.1. Directive Authority. This section provides guidance for emergency EOD response to
   hazardous explosives, or explosive devices, that threaten the civil populace, authorizing
   installation commanders, on request from civil authorities, to provide EOD assistance per the
   following conditions:
      7.3.1.1. All off-installation EOD emergency responses in support of civil authorities are
      initially treated as “immediate response authority” requests under DoD Directives
      3025.18, Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) until an on-site EOD assessment
      of the situation determines otherwise.
      7.3.1.2. As soon as practical, the particulars of the support to civil authorities (see
      paragraph 3.1.4) will be provided, through command post channels, to the National
      Military Command Center (NMCC).
      7.3.1.3. All DSCA response activities will be conducted IAW AFPD 10-8, Defense
      Support of Civil Authorities and AFI 10-801, Defense Support of Civil Authorities
      (DSCA).
   7.3.2. Reimbursement of civil EOD support. Flights will coordinate with their installation
   legal office and financial management/comptroller to build a list of expenses that are eligible
   for reimbursement and clarify when reimbursement for EOD support should be billed to civil
   authorities (e.g., loss of military specialized equipment, travel/per-diem costs, and/or military
   man-hours). Reimbursement applies only for response actions to non-military munitions.
   Emergency EOD support will not be withheld due to lack of reimbursement. Flights will
   also:
      7.3.2.1. Maintain logs of expenses incurred and resources expended when providing
      support to civil authorities.
      7.3.2.2. Report all DSCA support to their local Command Post and Comptroller.
      7.3.2.3. Work with their local Comptroller to develop procedures to seek reimbursement
      for EOD support provided to local and federal civil authorities.

       budgets. Flights should use a three-year historical basis to average and track expenditures.17
           8.1.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC EOD flights will forecast to attend the AF EOD
           Nuclear Working Group to serve as SMEs. (T-3)
           8.1.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) Flights will budget for a minimum of 10% of funded
           positions for personal retention gear annually. (T-2) The flight must develop a
           prioritized personal equipment requirement listing for new personnel arriving from EOD
           school. (T-2)
8.2. Cost Center Management (Budgets). Flight managers must prepare flight budgets, ensure
requirements are incorporated into the parent flight budget, monitor funds expenditure through
the year, and request additional funds when needed. Close coordination with squadron Resources
Managers and owning MAJCOM EOD staff is critical in an effective Planning, Programming,
Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) process.

                                         Chapter 9

             ASSESSMENTS, LESSONS LEARNED, AND EXERCISES / A9

9.1. Lessons Learned (LLs) Tracking. All levels of command may report lessons learned.
After Action Reports (AAR) are normally completed at deployed location or within 30 days after
completion of an operation. See Attachment 7, EOD After Action Report Process, for details
concerning the AAR program.
   9.1.1. Submitting LLs. A person or flight having LLs provides the issues in writing to the
   contingency theater headquarters staff and to the parent MAJCOM EOD Staff for review and
   consolidation, ensuring there is no redundancy in the Joint Universal Lessons Learned
   System (JULLS). MAJCOMs forward LLs to HQ AFCESA/CEXD for presentation to the
   EODP, or out-of-cycle EODP review if necessary.
   9.1.2. EODP Actions. The EODP will discuss and determine if the LLs warrant the
   expenditure of resources. If the EODP accepts/approves the LLs, they are linked to EODP
   Action Items for tracking and resolution.
   9.1.3. AFCEC/CXD Actions. CXD uses a Lessons Learned (LL) database to track LL until
   the EODIMS LL Module becomes available. Manage the EODIMS LL IAW the EODIMS
   CONOPS and EODIMS Users Manual.
9.2. EODP Action Item Process.
   9.2.1. Submitting Action Items.
       9.2.1.1. Any EOD personnel, flight, or agency having a proposal to bring before EODP
       must have MAJCOM EOD staff review and sponsorship for the proposal.
       9.2.1.2. The EODP is the first level for AF-level issues and recommendations affecting
       the AF EOD career field. A proposal brought before the EODP must be done in
       compliance with the EODP charter.
   9.2.2. Processing Action Items.
       9.2.2.1. The EODP will discuss and determine if the proposal warrants the expenditure
       of resources. The EODP takes appropriate action after the proposal is voted on (e.g.,
       create an action item).
       9.2.2.2. Each EODP action item is assigned an OPR, and actions toward completion are
       tracked in a HQ AFCESA/CEXD database. The data base is updated and managed
       throughout the year and scrubbed semi-annually during EODP meetings. Action Items
       are incorporated into the AF EOD Business Plan when appropriate.
       9.2.2.3. Action items involving CE policy or funding issues may require review and
       approval by the EESPG or the Civil Engineer Council (CEC).
9.3. Exercise Support and Planning.
   9.3.1. Home-Station Support. EOD flights should provide an additional duty member to the
   installation exercise evaluation team.

     9.3.2. EOD Support to Deployed Exercises. Unless on-site USAF EOD support is available
     at the exercise locations, MAJCOMs must provide EOD teams to support all aircraft
     deployment exercises when munitions are used. On-site USAF EOD support is necessary to
     provide safe and timely support for aircraft and munitions operations.18
9.4. Quality Assurance (QA). All EOD flights will have a QA program. Smaller EOD flights
may choose to adopt the parent squadron/wing program but flights are encouraged to have a
program within the EOD flight with a dedicated QA person/section. Quality Assurance is to be
performed by qualified military EOD personnel.
     9.4.1. Flight Management is responsible for oversight of the EOD program and will:
        9.4.1.1. Establish a flight QA program consisting of team evaluations and functional area
        inspections.
        9.4.1.2. Designate a NCO as the flight QA focal point responsible for administration of
        the QA program.
        9.4.1.3. Develop a method to track, monitor and close identified findings or
        discrepancies.
        9.4.1.4. The AF EOD SAV Checklist is available on the AF EOD Program Management
        CoP (https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/DocView.asp?DocID=6477270) and is the
        official overarching checklist for EOD flights, CONUS and OCONUS, and is provided as
        a tool for EOD flight leadership to conduct an in-depth self assessment of the flights
        operations and compliance. The Unit Compliance Checklist located on the AF Inspection
        Agency                                                                        website
        (https://www.my.af.mil/reservenetprod/talonsupport/SearchChecklist.aspx?Comma
        nd=AFIA&Type=CI&State=live&Dir=A7) is intended to be used by MAJCOM
        Inspector General Agency’s to focus on compliance issues only and generally will not
        focus on operational readiness.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU)

BETWEEN

{INSERT BASE NAME} AIR FORCE BASE AND

{INSERT STATE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY TITLE}

Parties: The parties to this MOU are {INSERT BASE NAME} Air Force Base a Department of
Defense (DoD) military organization located at {INSERT BASE NAME}, {INSERT STATE}
and the{INSERT STATE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY TITLE}.

Background:

DoD Component military organizations have personnel specially trained to handle all types of
explosives, including improvised explosive devices (IED). Other Federal agencies request
assistance from DoD Component Commander in emergencies involving explosives. These
situations call for immediate action to abate the safety threat by treatment in place or removal to
a safe location for treatment.

U.S. EPA’s Military Munitions Rule (MR) (62 FR 6622, Feb. 12, 1997) makes it clear that EOD
personnel engaged in an explosives or munitions emergency response are exempt from the
generator, transporter, treatment, storage, and disposal unit requirements of the Solid Waste
Disposal Act (42 USC Sec 6901, et seq.). The standards the MR established govern this MOU,
whether the Federal or state government is administering the MR or the Solid Waste Act, in
whole or part.

Except for providing temporary storage or treatment of explosives to provide emergency life
saving assistance to civilian authorities or to assist law enforcement agencies per established
agreements between DOD and the Federal agency concerned, the DOD is prohibited by law (10
USC 2692) from using DOD installations for the storage or treatment of non-DOD owned
hazardous materials.

Purpose: This MOU, which addresses the roles and responsibilities of all parties regarding
notification responsibilities during emergency response operations, is intended to:

Minimize the risk to public safety from the DoD Component Explosive Ordnance Disposal
(EOD) operations.

Maximize the efficiency, safety, and speed of any explosives treatment or retrieval operation.

Establish a framework for mutual assistance and consultation among the parties with respect to
Component EOD explosives or munitions emergency response operations

Scope: This MOU applies to DoD Component EOD explosives or munitions response
operations.

Definitions:

Explosives or Munitions Emergency. A situation, which involves the suspected or detected
presence of unexploded ordnance (UXO), damaged or deteriorated explosives or munitions,
improvised explosive device (IED) post rendered-safe hazardous components, other potentially
explosive material or devices, or other potentially harmful military munitions or devices, that
creates an actual or potential imminent threat to human health, to include public safety, or the
environment, to include property, as determined by an EOD specialist. The EOD specialist may
determine that such situations require immediate and expeditious action to control, mitigate, or
eliminate the threat.

Explosives or Munitions Emergency Response. All immediate response activities by an EOD
response specialist to control, mitigate, or eliminate the actual or potential threat encountered
during an explosive or munitions emergency. An explosives or munitions emergency response
may include in-place RSP, treatment or destruction of the explosives or munitions or the
transport of the items to another location to be rendered safe, treated, or destroyed. Any
reasonable delay in the completion of an explosives or munitions emergency response caused by
a necessary, unforeseen, or uncontrollable circumstance does not terminate the explosives or
munitions emergency response. Explosives or munitions emergency response can occur on either
private or public lands and are not limited to responses to RCRA facilities. There are two types
of explosives or munitions emergency responses:

Immediate response to situations where explosives or munitions are not properly secured or
under military control if military munitions and thus threaten or potentially threaten human
health and safety, the environment, or property. When extenuating circumstances exist, e.g.,
adverse weather, nightfall, or safety considerations, delay actions necessary to terminate an
explosives or munitions emergency, the response will be delayed until the necessary action(s)
can be accomplished. EOD or Technical Escort Unit (TEU) personnel must ensure explosives or
munitions are in a safe and secure environment. Items such as UXO’s, rendered-safe munitions,
partial munitions, damaged, and broken munitions components will be destroyed by EOD under
Level 1 response based on potential imminent threat at the earliest opportunity. Only under rare
exception would EOD turn-in munitions from a Level 1 response to munitions personnel. EOD
team leaders who determine a Level 2 or non-emergency (turn-in for Designated Disposition
Authorities (DDA) determination) approach to be more appropriate must document the reasons
for their decision in the EODIMS report of the response.”

Response actions to situations involving explosives or munitions which pose an imminent and
substantial danger to human health and safety, the environment, or property, but for which
response actions may be temporarily delayed without compromising safety or increasing risk.
When EOD or TEU support is not required during a Level 2 response, qualified personnel, such
as weapons officers, ammunition handlers, and trained and certified DoD contractors may
conduct Level 2 responses, or as directed. In such cases, time may allow for an emergency
AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                         101


permit to be obtained. The parties acknowledge that explosives or munitions emergencies present
unique facts and circumstances and must therefore be evaluated case-by-case. In the absence of
full and complete information, which frequently occurs when notice of an explosive or munitions
emergency is received and first responded to, emergency response specialists, based on their
knowledge, training, and experience, must use their best judgment in assessing risk. It is
therefore to be expected that as the response to an explosive or munitions emergency progresses,
a Level 1 response may become a Level 2 response and vice versa. Items creating a Level 2
emergency normally include non-DoD (commercial or foreign) munitions found on base (FOB)
or recovered from a emergency, and munitions that have been in the public domain and not been
within the DoD logistics system (cannot track the type of environment and handling the item has
been subjected to). These items are normally destroyed by EOD as a Level 2 response. They
may be temporarily held in storage awaiting permits or other circumstantial requirements; but as
a Level 2, DDA concurrence/ approval is not required for destruction. Coordinate with the base
environmental function before conducting a level 2 response. Only under rare exception would
EOD turn-in munitions from a Level 2 response to munitions personnel for DDA determination.
EOD team leaders who determine a non-emergency (turn-in for DDA determination) approach to
be more appropriate must document the reasons for their decision in the EODIMS report of the
response and inform the local environmental function.

Explosive or Munitions Emergency Response Specialist. Personnel trained in the identification,
handling, treatment, transport, and destruction of explosives or chemical and conventional
munitions. Explosives or munitions emergency response specialists include DoD EOD personnel
who are trained to responds to emergency situations involving military munitions and explosives;
DoD TEU personnel who are trained to respond to chemical munitions emergencies; and DOE,
National Guard, and Coast Guard specialists who are trained to respond to chemical munitions
emergencies. EOD and TEU personnel respond to on-installation and off-installation incidents
involving military munitions. They also respond to request by other Federal agencies or local
civil authorities for assistance with incidents involving non-military explosives with component
commander approval. DoD certified civilian or contractor personnel; and other Federal, State, or
local government, or civilian personnel similarly trained in explosives or munitions emergency
responses are also included.

Military Munitions. Per Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 260.10, Hazardous
Waste Management System, General, Sub Part B, Definitions; all ammunition products and
components produced or used by or for DoD or the U.S. Armed Services for national defense
and security, including military munitions under the control of the DoD, the U.S. Coast Guard,
the U.S. Department of Energy, and National Guard personnel.

The term military munitions includes: Confined gaseous, liquid, and solid propellants,
explosives, pyrotechnics, chemical and riot control agents, smokes, and incendiaries used by
DoD Components, including bulk explosives and chemical warfare agents, chemical munitions,
rockets, guided and ballistic missiles, bombs, warheads, mortar rounds, artillery ammunition,
small arms ammunition, grenades, mines, torpedoes, depth charges, cluster munitions and
dispensers, demolition charges, and devices and any components of such.

Does not include: wholly inert items, IEDs, and nuclear weapons, devices, and components of
such.

However, it does include nonnuclear components of nuclear devices, managed under DOE’s
nuclear weapons program after all required sanitization operations under the Atomic Energy Act
of 1954, as amended, have been completed.

of the emergency response is a non-military explosive or munitions.21



21
  NOTE: The DoD EOD or TEU organization responding to an explosives or munitions emergency or providing a
donor explosive used to destroy the object is not, under any condition or circumstances, responsible for remediation
actions. If the objective of the emergency response is a military munition, then DoD, the military service, or other
Federal agency (e.g., DOE) retains responsibility for any remediation of residual contamination.

 EXPLOSIVE ORDNANCE DISPOSAL (EOD) SIGNIFICANT-INCIDENT ANALYSIS
                         REPORT (SAR)

A4.1. General. This provides policy guidance for Air Force (AF) EOD duty-related accidents
or incidents, including hostile actions, that result in loss of an EOD Operator’s life or traumatic
injury resulting in the loss of a limb, eye sight, or other permanent incapacitating injuries to an
EOD Operator.
   A4.1.1. Purpose of the SAR is to provide swift and accurate feedback so that forward-
   deployed and CONUS EOD managers can mitigate and prevent successive incidents and as a
   means to improve lessons learned. The SAR will provide timely insight to the tactics,
   techniques, and procedures (TTP) surrounding a significant incident without having to wait
   for other agency reports (e.g., especially when it involves other service agencies). The SAR
   will provide the functional community the ability to analyze our TTP and take expeditious
   corrective actions.
   A4.1.2. Per the promulgation information in the front of each Joint Service EOD 60-series
   Technical Order (TO), TTP involving EOD operations are at minimum controlled
   unclassified information (CUI) and will contain the appropriate classification marking when
   required. SARs should not be released outside the AF EOD functional community and
   related chain of command and will not be released to the public. The SAR Directing
   Authority (paragraph A4.2.2) may authorize distribution to joint service EOD units and
   their chains of command as necessary.
   A4.1.3. Waivers. Waiver approval authority is AFCEC/CC. The Directing Authority may
   request waivers to SAR reporting through the chain of command having administrative
   control (ADCON) and operational control (/OPCON) authority.
A4.2. Responsibilities.
   A4.2.1. AF/A7C. AF EOD mishaps as a result of joint operations under a forward COCOM
   authority, may require Air Staff CE involvement.
       A4.2.1.1. In the event an incident investigation was not directed in a COCOM AO,
       AF/A7C may request the AF component to the COCOM direct a SAR of any serious
       incident involving AF EOD personnel.
       A4.2.1.2. If an incident investigation is directed by COCOM authority, the AF
       component to the COCOM should ensure that an AF EOD-qualified representative be
       part of the team conducting the investigation and preparing the report. Otherwise, refer
       to A4.2.1.1.
       A4.2.1.3. AF/A7CXR should engage with its functional counterparts at AF component
       commands to use established AF direct liaison authority to develop a procedure or
       agreement with joint service units in their AOR to expedite AF access to other service’s
       reports of investigation.
   A4.2.2. Directing Authority. Unit commanders at all levels of command have the inherent
   command authority to direct an investigation of any mishap affecting the personnel or
 108                                             AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


   missions under their command. Directing Authority for the SAR is normally the AF unit
   commander exercising ADCON/OPCON authority. The Directing Authority will:
       A4.2.2.1. Determine the scope and size of the SAR team, and designate one or more
       EOD personnel to research, analyze, and finalize all facets of the SAR.
          A4.2.2.1.1. The team lead must be EOD-qualified and a minimum grade of E7. (E8 if
          applicable per paragraph A4.4.2)
          A4.2.2.1.2. SAR team member(s) should not be assigned or attached to the unit the
          SAR is conducted on.
          A4.2.2.1.3. When SARs are conducted for incidents in deployed situations, at least
          one SAR team member should have EOD experience in the theater where the SAR is
          being conducted.
       A4.2.2.2. Ensure SARs cover all relevant factors.
       A4.2.2.3. Provide AF/A7CXR, HQ AFCESA/CEXD, and AF component EOD
       functional (if applicable) with updates and the final SAR as outlined in paragraph A4.4.
   A4.2.3. SAR Team Leader.
       A4.2.3.1. Conduct the SAR per paragraph A4.4 below with the emphasis of
       determining the necessary actions to fix a deficiency, not determining fault or blame.
       A4.2.3.2. Brief the SAR to the unit leadership and Directing Authority prior to release of
       data.
       A4.2.3.3. Brief the EOD Panel on final reports.
A4.3. Information Control.
   A4.3.1. Classified information, information from Joint Service 60-series TOs (normally
   limited to EOD Personnel only) or other CUI should be included via publication and
   paragraph references.
   A4.3.2. If they are not classified, SARs are at minimum For Official Use Only (FOUO).
   However, not each document in the report must be FOUO.
A4.4. Completing a SAR.
   A4.4.1. The Team Leader submits SARs to the Directing Authority in three stages: Initial
   (ISAR), Preliminary (PSAR), and Final (SAR).
       A4.4.1.1. ISAR. Within 48 hours of the incident the owning EOD Flight leadership will
       submit an ISAR containing the following information as a minimum: 1) a clear narrative
       of the incident with all known details surrounding the incident; 2) a description of injuries
       or illness to personnel involved; and 3) any other information related to the incident that
       requires rapid dissemination to potentially prevent injury to other personnel (i.e. new
       enemy TTP).
       A4.4.1.2. Preliminary Significant Incident Analysis Report (PSAR). The SAR team will
       submit a PSAR within 5 duty days. Include any updates to the information contained in
       the Initial Significant Incident Analysis Report (ISAR). If the SAR team has not had time
       to conduct a preliminary analysis, the EOD Flight leadership can submit the PSAR. In
AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                                         109


        most cases, the Level 1 EOD report (Storyboard) entered into EODIMS can be used to
        satisfy this requirement.
            A4.4.1.2.1. Significant Incident Working Group (SIG). Within 48 hours of receipt,
            HQ AFCESA/CEXD will send the PSAR or EOD Storyboard to a working group
            comprised of members from HAF, AFCESA, AFCENT, ACC, CoBRA and a
            representative from the affected MAJCOM. Others may be invited as applicable (i.e.
            Det 63, Det 3, AFRL, etc.). If at least two of the SIG members have not recently
            deployed (12 months), then two additional EOD personnel with recent deployment
            experience will be added to the SIG. This group will convene (either in person or via
            telecom/VTC), review the PSAR or Storyboard and develop areas of interest based on
            feedback from MAJCOM and EOD Senior Leadership. These questions or interest
            areas will be sent back to the SAR team within 7 days of receipt of the body
            convening for incorporation into the investigation and final report.
        A4.4.1.3. Complete the SAR within 20 duty-days of the incident. SAR can be in bullet
        or narrative format but must include the nine areas listed in paragraph A4.4.3. Place a
        greater priority on complete and accurate reports than on finishing in the 20 day timeline.
        Notify Directing Authority and HQ AFCESA/CEXD if the SAR timelines cannot be
        completed. Do not submit SARs for external staffing: SARs are internal EOD reporting
        tools used to correct operational TTPs.
        A4.4.1.4. If at anytime during the analysis the SAR team recognizes a grave disregard
        for safety or operational procedures with no clear explanation, take immediate action to
        prevent further injury or loss of life. Report this to the commander.
     A4.4.2. AF Participation in Non-AF Investigations. In combat situations, if the joint HQ
     uses another report format (e.g., Army Regulation 15-6), the AF will provide a member to
     the joint team if the incident involves an AF member. AF member will provide final copies
     of the joint report per A4.2.1.5. The member must be an EOD-qualified E8 or higher rank.22
     A4.4.3. Final SAR Contents. All SARs will include following information:
        A4.4.3.1. A clear narrative of the incident with all known details surrounding the
        incident. Identify and document hazards that played a role in the incident sequence.
        A4.4.3.2. First-hand witness accounts.
        A4.4.3.3. Other formal reports (e.g., safety message reports concerning the incident).
        A4.4.3.4. Injury and illness facts.
        A4.4.3.5. Summary List of pertinent facts.
        A4.4.3.6. Analysis of the facts and conclusions.23
        A4.4.3.7. Incident cause and recommended preventative measures. Specifically note all
        causal factors relating to equipment and/or training.



22
  NOTE: This instruction does not mandate AF participation if the incident did not involve an AF member.
23
  NOTE: SARs may include a clearly annotated “Statement of Opinion” on the causal factor when data cannot
provide determination.

       A4.4.3.8. Include the following paragraph: “The intent of this document is to provide
       insight into the incident, so that Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Airmen benefit
       from the lessons learned and heighten their awareness to both EOD standard operating
       procedures (SOPs) and TTPs as well as continually, changing enemy TTPs [if
       applicable]. This document includes questions raised during, as well as a result of, the
       post-incident analysis process. These questions are to be used as a case study learning
       tool.”
       A4.4.3.9. Other findings and recommendations of significance, which do not relate
       directly to the causes of the incident, but can be of value in risk management and incident
       prevention.
   A4.4.4. Upon completion of the SAR or AR 15-6, the SIG will review the SAR or AR 15-6
   and provide final recommendations in a lessons-learned narrative to HQ AFCESA/CEXD.
       A4.4.4.1. AFCESA/CEXD will send a final lessons learned SIG report to A7CXR for
       staffing to A7C for approval and posting on a single, HQ AFCESA-designated Casualty
       Lessons Learned SharePoint site for use by all EOD flights during annual training. This
       folder will include all applicable documents to include initial SPOTREP, EOD
       Storyboards and final Lessons Learned Report. Due to the sensitive nature of AR 15-6
       documents, they will not be posted but will be available to Senior Leadership.
A4.5. SAR Distribution: The final SAR should be an “internal EOD work-product” until
AFCESA/CEXD develops sanitized report for EOD flight distribution. This sanitized report
should focus on TTPs, lessons learned, training deficiencies to correct, etc.
A4.6. SAR Disposition. HQ AFCESA/CEXD is the EOD office of record and will maintain an
electronic copy of the SAR as permanent.

               DISPOSAL RANGE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS EXCERPT

A5.1. RANGE REQUIREMENTS.
   A5.1.1. All disposal ranges will be cited IAW AFMAN 91-201 and the following guidance
   presented below will be incorporated into EOD disposal range operations. Refer to AFMAN
   91-201 for EOD Proficiency Training Range requirements. A typical disposal range is shown
   in Figure A5.1.
   A5.2. Regulations of host nations concerning disposal operations will not be violated. When
   Army/Navy disposal ranges utilized by the AF, Army/Navy range requirements will control.
   A5.3. Bombing ranges may be utilized for disposal operations when authorized by the
   agency having operational control over them. Requirements of the range controlling activity
   will be adhered to; however, all safety criteria in this regulation must be followed. Normally,
   signs and warning devices employed during active range periods are adequate for disposal
   operations and need not be duplicated.
   A5.4. All dry grass, leaves, and other combustible materials within a radius of 61 meters
   (200 feet) will be removed from point of burning/detonating site. The radius may be
   reduced, commensurate with fire hazards, for recognized burning furnace sites provided
   written approval from Major Air Command had been received. Under no circumstances will
   the radius be reduced to less than 15 meters (50 feet). The site will be free of deep cracks in
   which unburned explosives or agents may lodge. The use of concrete pads for burning or
   detonation is not permissible.
   A5.5. A holding area will be provided to accept initial deliveries of munitions for disposal
   and demolition materials. The holding area will be located within the disposal range, but at a
   suitable distance from disposal sites to preclude uncontrolled destruction of the material by
   flying fragments, grass fires or burning embers. All dry grass, leaves and combustible
   material will be removed within a 15 meter (50 foot) radius of the holding area. Munitions to
   be disposed of, demolition material, and blasting caps will be separated by a minimum of 7.6
   meters (25 feet) within the holding area. After initial delivery to the holding area, munitions
   for disposal and the necessary demolition material will be delivered to the actual disposal site
   as required. If a disposal range is not large enough to provide an absolutely safe holding
   area, munitions will only be delivered to the disposal site in quantities for immediate
   disposal. Holding area will be sited IAW AFMAN 91.201.
   A5.6. Tools and equipment to be employed during disposal operations will be afforded
   protection to prevent damage. Safety equipment/clothing will be readily available but most
   be protected from damage.
A5.7. A first aid kit, NSN 6545-00-116-1410, or suitable substitute, will be immediately
available during disposal operations. An ambulance or first aid vehicle, manned by emergency
medical support must be available within 30 minutes while the operations are being performed.
The medical support must be analogous to the expected trauma resulting from an accident (Ref:
AFMAN 91-201, Para 7.5.3.).
 112                                             AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


   A5.8. Fire fighting equipment will be present at the scene to combat grass, brush or
   equipment fires. Type of equipment and any additional protective measures deemed
   necessary in high fire risk areas/periods will be coordinated with the Base Fire Marshall.
   A5.9. A means of communication with both the base facilities and disposal personnel will be
   established. Communication may be by the most convenient method (radio, telephone,
   walkie-talkie, etc.); but the equipment used will be in good working order prior to
   commencing any disposal operation.
A5.10. Where operations require the use of a personnel shelter, the shelter will be located
not less than 100 meters (328 feet) from the disposal site and will afford substantial fragment-
proof overhead cover and frontal protection.

   A5.11. The following minimum requirements are to be employed during a disposal
   operation:
       A5.11.1. Red range flag to be flown during disposal operations and removed only after
       the range has been declared safe. The flag will be a minimum of 0.91 meters (three feet)
       wide by 1.52 meters (five feet) long. Flag must be displayed at a height to where it will
       be a visible warning from a safe distance at all points of access to explosive operation.
       A5.11.2. AFTO Forms 61, with legend “ Danger – Explosive Disposal Range – Keep
       Out “ imprinted in them may be ordered in amounts needed through proper channels.
       AFTO Form 61 is listed in AFR 0-9. These forms will be posted at entrances and at 91
       meter (300 feet) intervals around the perimeter of the range. Any additional required
       multilingual information will be posted below forms in black letters 5.08 centimeters
       (two inches) on a white background. See Figure 1-1.
       A5.11.3. Barricades, gates or guards at all entrances.
       A5.11.4. In areas where disposal ranges are not under constant control of US Armed
       Forces, the provisions of preceding subparagraphs A5.11.1, A5.11.2, and A5.11.3 may be
       waived, provided the following requirements are strictly adhered to:
           A5.11.4.1. Prior to starting disposal operations, the disposal range will be searched
           for unauthorized personnel.
           A5.11.4.2. Guards will be posted to prevent entry into areas prior to and throughout
           the disposal operation. Guards will be afforded adequate protection from fragments.
   A5.12. PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS.
       A5.12.1. Personnel requirements and restrictions listed below are the minimum
       requirements for personnel assigned to disposal operations. Persons not necessary to the
       operation being conducted will be barred from the disposal range. The number of
       personnel engaged in disposal operations will be kept to a minimum but in no case less
       than two.
       A5.12.2. Commanders will ensure that care is exercised in the assignment of personnel
       to disposal duties. All personnel employed in disposal activities will be thoroughly
       trained in the nature of the material being handled, the hazards involved, and the
AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                         113


     applicable operating safety procedures and precautions to be observed. The danger of
     using shortcuts will be thoroughly instilled in the minds of all personnel.
     A5.12.3. Supervisory Personnel. Disposal procedures will be performed under the
     supervision of personnel qualified and highly proficient in such activities. The supervisor
     will be present during all disposal operations and will be charged with the control of all
     firing devices and will be responsible for preparation, placement, and firing of charges.
     Responsibility will not be divided. Supervisory responsibilities include, but are not
     limited to, the following actions:
         A5.12.3.1. Have at the site approved written procedures covering the specific
         munition being disposed of and enforce strict compliance with procedures as written.
         A5.12.3.2. Instill in all personnel the dangers of shortcuts or deviations from written
         procedures.
         A5.12.3.3. Take corrective action in all violations of procedures or orders whether or
         not an accident occurs.
         A5.12.3.4. Direct construction and use of personnel shelters if and where necessary.
         A5.12.3.5. Ensure availability of required protective equipment; that personnel are
         familiar with the use of such equipment.
         A5.12.3.6. Ensure that sufficient personnel are trained in treatment of casualties and
         will advise all personnel of any self-aid measures to minimize or prevent injury.
         A5.12.3.7. Be knowledgeable of the characteristics of chemical agents and methods
         of detecting leakage.
         A5.12.3.8. Be thoroughly familiar with the influence of weather conditions on
         disposal operations.
  A5.13. Protective measures regarding personnel and equipment will be strictly enforced
  during all disposal operations. Additional guidance for explosive items and chemical agents
  may be found in AFMAN 91-201, AFM 160-12, Treatment of Chemical Agent Casualties
  and Conventional Military Chemical Injuries, and the specific item technical manual. The
  following agencies, as a minimum, will be notified prior to accomplishing disposal
  procedures listed in this manual:
     A5.13.1. Medical facility
     A5.13.2. Security Police
     A5.13.3. Fire Department
     A5.13.4. Base Operations
     A5.13.5. EOD (When available on base)
  A5.14. At minimum safe distances in AFMAN 91-201, personnel in the open may be
  exposed to some fragments and debris. Therefore, greater distances should be used,
  explosive weights lowered, or action taken to reduce hazards by:
     A5.14.1. Confinement of the explosive results at the source to the extent possible.
     A5.14.2. Use of barricades adjacent to the exposure of the source or both.

                    EOD AFTER ACTION REPORT (AAR) PROCESS

A7.1. Use the following guidance to process EOD AARs to ensure standard, valid routing
and effective feedback for lessons learned and trend analysis.
   A7.1.1. In the context of this attachment, AARs are limited to those reports resulting from
   deployments in contingency operations. AARs must focus on what was done right or wrong
   with regards to Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education,
   Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF) issues. AARs are not meant to be sounding boards for
   personality conflicts, generalizations, or perceptions; rather, it is for capturing observations
   that are measurable, observable, and sustainable. The opening of the AAR should discuss
   what the unit or IA did during the tour; who they supported and what was accomplished.
   A7.2. AFCENT AARs will be managed by the USAFCENT/A7XE.
      A7.2.1. To preserve integrity and transparency of the feedback process, the original
      AAR from the deployed leadership will be loaded onto the “EOD AFCENT Program
      Management                                                                     CoP”
      https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=22760             in
      “After Action Reports (AAR)” exactly as written.
      A7.2.2. There are two subfolders under “After Action Reports (AAR);” “Original
      AARs” and “With Comments,” the distinctions are self-explanatory.
   A7.3. AARs are mandatory for every flight (Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and all
   AFCENT flights regardless of location) and highly encouraged for all others (Combined
   Explosive Exploitation Cell (CEXC), Liaison Officer (LNO), etc). Everyone who has a
   lesson learned or idea on how to improve operations at EOD deployed locations should
   submit an AAR.
   A7.4. AFCENT will reinforce with Flight leaders the value and importance of
   communicating their issues up the chain; and, will require feedback early in the deployment,
   midway, and at the end. EOD flight leaders need to understand that their comments will be
   available to a much wider audience, and they need to use their communications skills
   effectively.
   A7.5. Submission Process:
      A7.5.1. 30-days prior to Replacements In Place (RIP)/Transfer Of Authority (TOA),
      AFCENT will suspense the flights to send their AARs.
      A7.5.2. AFCENT recognizes that Battalions or Squadron Commanders will require AAR
      submittals, and those formats will be acceptable.
      A7.5.3. When AARs are written after-the-fact at home station, the AAR must be routed
      back to AFCENT/A7XE to be processed.
      A7.5.4. The process will be transparent: it must remain unclassified to the highest extent
      possible. Classified AARs will be handled in the same manner via the SIPR net.
   A7.6. Review Process:
118                                           AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


      A7.6.1. When the USAFCENT/A7XE EOD staff receives an AAR, they will provide
      (within 15 work days) the original AAR and one with initial AFCENT comments to the
      AFCESA EOD Trends Analyst.
      A7.6.2. Prior to sending the comments forward, the member’s observations will be
      scrutinized to determine if they are measurable, achievable, and sustainable. Therefore,
      some observations that do not pass the test (personality conflicts, generalizations,
      perceptions, etc.), will be removed from the AAR going up for analysis.
      A7.6.3. The original comments will remain a matter of record for all CoP members to
      review.
      A7.6.4. Validated comments will be assessed to determine if it falls under Doctrine,
      Organization, Training and Education, Material, Leadership or Facilities (DOTMLF).
      A7.6.5. HQ AFCESA/CEXD Trends Analyst will use the AAR with AFCENT
      comments to evaluate comments and dissect the AARs into taskers for (EOD) technical
      experts (e.g., AFCESA, A7CXR, NAVEODTECHDIV, NAVSCOLEOD, AFCENT,
      AFNORTH, etc).
      A7.6.6. HQ AFCESA/CEXD will provide lessons learned and appropriate feedback to
      AFCESA/CEXX for inclusion in the CE Lessons Learned Program and Joint Lessons
      Learned Information System.
      A7.6.7. HQ AFECESA/CEXD Trends Analyst will post and track all comments on the
      EOD                               Management                             CoP;
      https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-EN-CE-49.
      A7.6.8. The issues will then be worked by the EOD panel or responsible staff agencies
      will then work their respective issues and report status back to AFCESA to close the
      loop.
      A7.6.9. HQ AFCESA/CEXD will maintain an AAR feedback folder on the EOD
      Program Management CoP.
  A7.7. AARs originating from theaters/operations other than AFCENT should follow the
  intent of the process outlined in this attachment.
AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                          119

3. Pre-operational Safety Assessment.

3.1. EOD operations will be conducted under the supervision and control of the EOD Team
Leader (TL).

3.2. Prior to the start of disposal or training operations, the TL designates a Range Safety Officer
(RSO). The RSO is responsible for ensuring all safety aspects of the operation are properly
applied in support of the TL. The RSO will not participate as a worker during the explosive
operation.

3.2.1. The RSO will conduct a briefing to cover tasks to be performed, safety precautions and
emergency procedures. The duties of the RSO and TL may be performed by the same person.

WARNING

Ground yourself prior to handling initiating explosives; work on grounded surfaces if possible.

Personnel handling electrically initiated explosive devices will avoid wearing clothes made of
material, which have high static generating characteristics.

Use available frontal/overhead protection during detonation – do not stand in view of the
munitions to be detonated.

CAUTION
 122                                              AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


Remember Cardinal Principal of Explosive Safety: “Expose the minimum amount of people to
the minimum amount of explosives for the minimum amount of time.”

3.2.2. The RSO will brief visitors and casuals on type of ordnance and associated hazards.
Provide specific instructions on where to drive, park, and walk; and not to touch items they may
encounter (“if you didn’t drop it, don’t pick it up”). Show visiting and casual personnel the
specific frontal/overhead protected area in which to take cover.

3.3. Non-Essential Personnel Escort: If visitors are on range, stop all operations and assign an
escort to ensure safety rules are followed. Escort to visitor ratio will not exceed 1:5. The RSO
may be the Escort, but only if there is a separate TL leading the operation (one person may not
be all three, TL, RSO and Escort).

NOTE

All personnel wanting to proceed down range after commencement of the operation will do so
only after obtaining approval from the Range Safety Officer (RSO). Personnel will then be
briefed on all hazards present.

Any unsafe actions observed by EOD personnel will be immediately brought to the attention of
the RSO. The RSO will cease operations until unsafe condition is corrected. If unable to resume
safe operations, withdraw to a safe distance and inform EOD Operations [and appropriate Range
Control Office] that the EOD operation is terminated.

3.4. The TL will ensure two-way radio (or phone) communication is operational and available
(for both TL and RSO) during all explosive operations. Both a primary and a secondary means
communication are preferred.

WARNING

Do not conduct hand-held radio transmissions within 25 feet (100 feet when using vehicle
radios) of electro-explosive devices (EEDs).

Modern Mobile Emitters (MME) such as key fobs and cellular phones will not be operated
within 10 feet of EEDs.

3.5. Remove rings and watches prior to starting any explosive operation.

3.6. Do not handle munitions roughly (e.g., rolled, tumbled, dropped, dragged or thrown).

3.7. If an abnormal condition occurs, stop the operation until the condition is corrected.

3.8. Observe wait times of 30 minutes for electrically primed misfires and 1 hour for non-
electrically primed misfires.
AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014                                                               123


3.9. Cease all explosive operations when there is lightning within 5 nautical miles (AFMAN 91-
201, paragraph 7.34).

3.10. Only one EOD technician will check the detonation point after a planned detonation with a
second person acting as a safety backup. This rule also applies when checking items kicked out
by a detonation. Deviation for the sake of training is not authorized.

3.11. Do not proceed directly down range if the detonation results in a range fire. If it can be
ascertained that the fire can be contained, immediately respond and try to control the fire while

FACT SHEET: EOD SPECIALIST RETRAINEE VOLUNTEER STATEMENT

1. Congratulations on your decision to volunteer for the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
Specialist career field. This document is provided to ensure that your decision to volunteer for
EOD Specialist duties is as well-informed as possible. By signing this document you
acknowledge that you have discussed each topic listed below with an experienced EOD operator,
viewed the EOD DVD, and understand each statement.

1.1. I have viewed the EOD Specialist recruiting DVD and all of my questions have been
answered to my satisfaction.

1.2. I will attend the EOD Preliminary School. The purpose of the EOD Preliminary Course is to
introduce me to the EOD career field and assess my potential for success as an EOD Specialist.
The EOD Preliminary Course lasts 20 days and is conducted on Sheppard AFB, Texas.
Following completion of the EOD Preliminary School I will be sent to Navy School EOD
(NAVSCOLEOD) at Eglin AFB, FL. This joint service school consists of seven months of
intense training. Normal training days start with 0600 formation for physical training and
usually end around 2000 after training, evaluations and study hall.

1.3. I understand that many people who start the EOD Specialist Orientation are not able to
continue training for academic (and other) reasons. My failure to complete the EOD training
phases will be handled within the rules as outlined by AFPC. Each individual case will be
treated on its own merit.

1.4. I understand, as part of normal EOD operations and training throughout my EOD career, I
may conduct duties outdoors in remote locations, and sometimes in extreme weather conditions
requiring a high degree of both physical and mental endurance.

1.5. I understand that EOD Specialist duties will require me to be responsible for others’ learning
and safety in challenging conditions. I understand the primary duties associated with the EOD
specialty include, but are not limited to; the use and handling of explosives, the detection,
identification, render-safe, recovery, field evaluation and disposal of damaged aircraft,
improvised explosive devices (IED), nuclear, chemical, biological, and conventional ordnance
which has been fired, dropped, or placed, and has failed to detonate and as such constitutes a
hazard to military and civilian personnel, installations, or material. I will be expected to display
 128                                              AFI32-3001_AFGSCSUP_I 31 MARCH 2014


and learn responsibility, attention to detail, communication skills and leadership. I volunteer to
perform these duties.

1.6. I understand that primary EOD Specialist duties may include direct combat (engaging an
enemy face-to-face). EOD Specialists do deploy to combat zones throughout the world and as a
result may be exposed to combat situations that threaten life and limb.

1.7. I will be required to operate government vehicles and as a result I will be required to obtain
a military driver’s license upon arrival at my first EOD duty station. I do not have a restricted,
suspended or revoked driver’s license from any state that would prevent me from obtaining a
driver’s license at this point in my application process or after I become an EOD Specialist.

2. Again, congratulations on your decision to volunteer for the EOD Specialist career field.
There will be challenges you’ve never experienced but the rewards will be unequalled! We look
forward to you joining EOD as one of America’s combat Airmen.

EOD specialist. If I fail to complete EOD training, I may be discharged from the Air Force if my
Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) scores are below 55 in any category.
Reclassification into another Air Force Specialty is subject to availability of other technical

as a result may be exposed to direct combat situations.
