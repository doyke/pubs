   conjunction with other AFSOC SF SOF enabler forces. Enhances security of AFSOC
   aircraft and C4I sites. Both members must be trained and qualified IAW an advanced
   designated marksman course. Supports both day and night operations.
2.8. SF SOF FAST (QFM1C (previously named QFDGR)).
   2.8.1. Organization. A five-person FAST qualified team is comprised of one SF 7-level
   team leader and four 5-level SF team members.
   2.8.2. Duties. Provides rapidly deployable, focused FP for AFSOC/SOF aerospace forces.
   Provide security for AFSOC/SOF aircraft transiting airfields where security is unknown or
   deemed inadequate to counter local threats. Advises the mission commander on FP
   measures, conducts FP surveys, provides close-in security, and assists with SOF led
   protective service operations. Ensures adequate security for AFSOC/SOF resources by

    assessing and interfacing with other in-place DOD and host nation base defense forces and
    coordinating with OSI when available. Teams may perform other security missions as
    required by the mission commander (MC) to ensure SOF mission success.
    2.8.3. Additional Information: UTC deployment requirements will be determined by the
    SOW/SOG mission planners in close coordination with the SOW/SOG TWG. UTCs may
    deploy as an independent element (SF flight leadership is required when more than two
    teams are deployed). The team leader performs DSC duties when deployed independently;
    liaises and coordinates to integrate AFSOC close-in security with other in-place DOD and
    host nation base defense forces. One team is capable of providing SOF-FAST for up to two
    concurrent sorties. The five-person team composition is based on providing a DSC/area
    supervisor with two 2-person teams working alternating 12-hour shifts. Additional teams are
    required for multiple aircraft and/or extended deployments/exercises. SF SOF Security
    Enabling Equipment UTC (QFL1D) may be required depending on availability of facilities,
    transportation, and other support equipment at the deployed site. Personnel deploy as
    mission essential ground personnel. SOF-FAST remain operational control (OPCON) and
    tactical control (TACON) to the deployed AFSOC/SOF Commander.
2.9. AFOSI/SMB QFAAW or QFAAG.
    2.9.1. Duties. Provide rapidly deployable, CI/FP or Counter-Threat Operations (CTO)
    capability to the deployed mission commander and available U.S. country team. UTCs
    normally deploy as an independent element and should nearly always be tasked in pairs to
    meet the two-person concept for safety. Personnel deploy as mission essential personnel.
    AFOSI/SMB TACON to the deployed mission commander.
    2.9.2. Contact the AFOSI LNO to AFSOC to delineate which UTC to utilize for mission
    planning. QFAAW is the primary UTC.

                MISSION PLANNING AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Objective. Provide a right-sized force to ensure adequate security for deployed AFSOC
resources.
3.2. Mission Planning. The required SF capability will be tailored based on a detailed mission
analysis/estimate of the situation IAW AFSOCI 14-102, Threat Working Group. SOW/SOG
mission planners will work with their local SF, AFOSI SMB and TWG to identify when security
and/or CI/FP are recommended to support exercises, training missions, contingency operations
and small/large scale deployments. The minimum members of the threat working group will be
Security Forces, Intelligence, OSI and Medical, the most critical input for the development of the
force protection posture for the SOF-FAST Team comes from the current and relevant
intelligence fused with all available data from the TWG. The role of intelligence in force
protection is critical and every effort should be made to guarantee that no gaps exist in support to
force protection and the mission (AFI 14-119). The MC will receive an aircraft security
recommendation from their local TWG based on current intelligence reporting and local and
regional threat status using the standardized AFSOC SOF-FAST and aircraft security
recommendation matrix (Attachment 2). An Antiterrorism (AT) Level II qualified security forces
subject matter expert may be required to evaluate the current situation and briefed intelligence
using the standardized AFSOC SOF-FAST and aircraft security recommendation matrix
(Attachment 2) in an in extremist or on the fly situation. Compliance with the Foreign Clearance
Guide (FCG), coordination with the applicable US embassy, and an informed risk management
decision is integral to the SOW/SOG mission planning process. The SOG Commander or
designated official must approve any tailored security measures during the planning process
(authority may not be delegated lower than the MC).
3.3. Lessons Learned. A review of After-Action Reports (AAR), Lessons Learned Reports,
Trip Reports and Site Surveys are the means by which HQ AFSOC/A7S records and addresses
issues, best practices and lessons learned from major exercises, contingency operations and
deployments provide an excellent base for the planning. Active participation of the program
will ensure the most current information is readily available to the deploying members. Reports
and surveys should include an executive summary covering the event information (i.e., dates,
locations, participant units/organizations, etc.), lessons observed, issues/problems encountered
with recommended corrective actions. Approved AARs, Lessons Learned, Trip Reports, and
Site Surveys will be stored and centrally managed in the Joint Lessons Learned Information
System (JLLIS) database, IAW CJCSI 3150.25D, and also available on the HQ AFSOC/A7S
Lessons Learned Program SharePoint Sites:
NIPR: https://eis.afsoc.af.mil/sites/A7/A7S/AAR/default.aspx
SIPR: https://afsofnet.afsoc.af.mil/sites/A7/A7S/AAR/default.aspx
   3.3.1. Submission Process. The senior deployed team leader will consolidate After-Action
   Reports (AAR), Lessons Learned Reports, Trip Reports, and Site Surveys inputs from
   subordinate unit members, validate observations and once approved, submit the signed report
   to the AFSOC (HQ AFSOC/A7S) central repository NLT end-event +15 days (or as
   directed). Note: Units will email HQ AFSOC/A7SO Email Distribution list to request
 10                                                            AFSOCI31-100 28 MARCH 2013


   access to Lessons Learned Program SharePoint Site. AFI 90-1601 directs submission of
   After Action Reports within 30 days following operation or exercise end. Chain of command
   involvement is key in validating all AAR and Lessons Learned (L2) submissions. Use AAR
   formats designated by your chain of command. In addition to local instructions, all validated
   AFSOC L2 are entered into the Joint Lessons Learned Information System-SOF (JLLIS-
   SOF) at http://www.JLLIS.smil.mil/usaf/. Air Force issues are entered in AF-JLLIS at
   http://www.jllis.smil.mil/usaf/. Per CJCSI 3150.25D, the JLLIS database is the official
   designated system of record for storing lessons learned. AARs and L2 are also submitted to
   AFSOC A3 and A9L in addition to JLLIS for identification of observations, issues, and
   lessons to both SOF and AFSOC Lessons Learned Programs. Refer to USSOCOM Directive
   11-3, AFI 90-1601, AFSOC SUP 90-1601, and CJCSI 3150.25D for further guidance on both
   active and passive collection of L2.
3.4. Virtual Risk Assessment Database (vRAD). AMC vRAD, although not binding for
AFSOC forces, is a useful reference tool to use during initial planning to determine the terrorist
and criminal threat level as well as if the location is identified as a Raven required location. This
listing is updated daily by a multitude of intelligence and security professionals. It can be found
on the SIPR AMC FP page at http://www.amcin.scott.af.smil.mil.
   3.4.1. SODARS: SOFonline.socom.smil.mil/sites/j2/jicsoc/sodars.
   3.4.2. ISP: Hotr.dia.smil.mil.
   3.4.3. HOTr: SOFrelonline.socom.smil.mil/sites/j2/public/isppages/isp%
   20products.aspx.
3.5. Deployed Security Requirements. Deployed aircraft security requirements are mandated
by AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense; AFI 31-101, AFSOCSUP, Integrated Defense; AFI 31-104,
The Air Force RAVEN Program; and AFI 10-245, Air Force Anti- Terrorism (AT) Standards.
Additional aircraft specific security procedures can be found in the applicable AFTTP 3-3MDS,
Combat Aircraft Fundamentals; AFTTP 3-1MDS, Combat Aircraft Training; and AFI 11-
2MDS, Volume 3, Aircraft Procedures. Arrangements must be made to protect the aircraft
while at deployed locations if SF do not deploy with the aircraft. In those cases, the MC will
work with the US Embassy responsible for that county, the requesting agency, and/or security
personnel at the deployed location to coordinate for adequate security.
3.6. Tailored Security Measures.
   3.6.1. Tailored security measures at deployed locations must be approved by the MC and the
   respective Air Operations Center (AOC) must be notified as soon as possible.
   3.6.2. Compliance with established security requirements may be impractical at times due to
   mission, terrain, climate, sociopolitical sensitivities, or other factors. At a minimum, aircraft
   entry points and hatches should be locked. If it is not possible to lock the aircraft, secure
   aircraft entry points and hatches in a manner to indicate unauthorized entry, e.g., taping hatch
   release handles or using seals. Contact with the US Embassy is required at locations where
   security agreements do not exist.
   3.6.3. For unscheduled or emergency landings at unplanned airfields, the aircraft commander
   (AC) will assess the aircraft security situation and take actions IAW the appropriate AFI 11-
   2, MDS, Volume 3, Aircraft Procedures. If the aircrew is not capable of providing adequate
AFSOCI31-100 28 MARCH 2013                                                                 11


   security, the AC will request/coordinate security through available channels and notify the
   respective AOC as soon as possible.

                                           Chapter 4

                           SOF FLY-AWAY SECURITY TEAMS

4.1. SOF-FAST Definition. SOF-FAST is security for special operations aircraft transiting
airfields where security is unknown or deemed inadequate to counter local threats.
4.2. SOF-FAST will travel in mission essential ground personnel status. Due to the
sensitivity of carrying weapons in foreign countries, many missions will call for weapons to
remain inside the aircraft and outside of sight from foreign nationals. AFI 31-104, The Air Force
RAVEN Program, provides additional guidance concerning this issue.
4.3. SOF-FAST. Should comply with Raven program requirements outlined in AFI 31-104,
The Air Force RAVEN Program, with the following exceptions:
   4.3.1. AFSOC is not required to comply with AMC fly-away security requirements for
   Raven required locations, but instead will use this information as an important factor to
   consider when determining if AFSOC fly-away security is needed.
   4.3.2. SOF aircraft missions are tracked through their respective AOC and not by the Tanker
   Airlift Control Center.
   4.3.3. Airfield FP survey data gathered during SOF missions should be reported to AMC
   IAW AFI 31-104, The Air Force RAVEN Program, to the largest extent possible. Due to the
   sensitivity of some information, the unit commander must approve the release of data
   gathered during SOF missions to agencies outside AFSOC or USSOCOM.
   4.3.4. SOF-FAST will normally not be transported on gunships. If gunship fly-away
   security is required, SOF-FAST personnel will normally be transported separately to the
   required location.
   4.3.5. Low visibility procedures:
       4.3.5.1. SOF-FAST personnel must be capable of blending in with the aircrew and/or
       airport personnel in order to avoid attracting unnecessary attention. As such, SOF-FAST
       personnel are authorized wear of the flight suit and civilian attire as required when
       performing fly-away security duties. Additionally, SOF-FAST personnel must be trained
       and qualified to carry a concealed weapon in order to provide armed security in a low
       visibility posture. The MC is the approval authority for carrying a concealed weapon
       when deployed, consistent with host nation law, international law and other applicable
       authorities.
       4.3.5.2. SOF-FAST must be capable of providing both overt and covert infrared lighting
       for parked aircraft in order to enhance aircraft security and provide a low visibility
       lighting option.
   4.3.6. Recommended team size for SOF-FAST missions:
       4.3.6.1. When fly-away security is required and the aircraft ground time is less than 12-
       hours, two to three SOF-FAST personnel are recommended to support the mission.
       Generally, two personnel remain with the aircraft and the team leader coordinates
       security with forces at the offsite airfield/aircraft staging area and conducts a FP survey.
AFSOCI31-100 28 MARCH 2013                                                                    13


     On rare occasions one SOF-FAST member could be teamed with either an OSI agent or
     another crew member, but this should only occur when the employment of two SOF-
     FAST personnel is not possible.
     4.3.6.2. When fly-away security is required and the aircraft ground time is more than 12-
     hours, but less than 7-days; five SOF-FAST personnel are recommended for mission
     support. Generally, two personnel work alternating 12-hour shifts and the team leader
     performs duties as the area supervisor, coordinates security with forces at the offsite
     airfield/aircraft staging area and conducts a FP survey. The team is capable of providing
     security for multiple aircraft parked in the same area; in other cases multiple aircraft may
     require additional SOF- FAST.
     4.3.6.3. For missions where aircraft are operating from an airfield for longer than 7-days,
     AFSOC Site/Aircraft Security Teams are recommended to provide aircraft security.

                                  FORCE PRESENTATION

5.1. Employment. Examples of how AFSOC SF SOF enabler forces may be employed are
defined in the following paragraphs. Other employment examples that are not included may call
for as few as one highly trained special operations security forces (SOSF) expert or full scale
execution of an existing war plan.
   5.1.1. Employment of AFOSI SMB. In nearly all cases, AFOSI SMB operates in two-
   person teams.
5.2. Small Scale. The below diagram outlines an example of AFSOC SOF enabler forces on a
“short-term” deployment to a site where SOF aircraft are operating; aircraft are also transiting
other airfields and landing zones. Sufficient personnel must be deployed in order to provide 24/7
security coverage. This example assumes other forces are in place to provide adequate site
defense.

   LNO) to advise concerning Special Operations Security Forces (SOSF) employment.
   5.2.2. A MSgt and two SSgt’s as command and control (C2) for SOF site/aircraft/fly-away
   security and coordination with base defense forces.
   5.2.3. Five-personnel for fly-away security and tactical evidence collection.
   5.2.4. Five-personnel for close-in aircraft security and five-personnel for Joint Special
   Operations Air Detachment (JSOAD) site security.

   5.2.5. One 2-person team to provide over-watch of likely avenues of approach leading to
   SOF resources (one team does not provide 24/7 capability).
5.3. Large Scale. Below diagram outlines an example of how AFSOC SF SOF enabler forces
could be employed on an “extended” deployment in a theater where a JSOAC is not collocated
with the primary airfield where SOF aircraft are operating; aircraft are also transiting multiple
airfields and landing zones. Sufficient personnel must be deployed in order to provide 24/7
security and a duty schedule that provides adequate rest and relief. This example assumes other
forces are in place to provide adequate base defense.

                                           TRAINING

6.1. Required Training.
   6.1.1. Personnel assigned to SF SOF enabler UTCs will complete required AF ancillary and
   currency training IAW with AF instructions and unit operating instructions. Note:
   Personnel changing duty stations from stateside to overseas SOGs will have priority for
   attending Deployed Aircraft Ground Response Element (DAGRE) training pipeline. SOGs
   will coordinate with HQ AFSOC/A7SX during the PCS to coordinate slots in the subsequent
   DAGRE training pipeline.
   6.1.2. Regional Training Center (RTC) Training.         Unit Commanders will request
   waivers/exceptions to RTC or other training requirements by submitting a memorandum to
   HQ AFSOC/A7S for approval or disapproval by HQ AFSOC/A71. HQ AFSOC/A7S will
   inform HQ AFSFC/CC, by memorandum, on any approved waivers/exceptions. ANG
   AFSOC units will coordinate RTC waivers through NGB/A7S. Approved waivers must be
   forward to AFSOC/A71 through AFSOC/A7S. Note: A RTC waiver memorandum
   template is at Attachment 3.
   6.1.3. The below table identifies initial training requirements for personnel assigned to each
   UTC.
