1.4. Aircrew Training Policy. The primary training method for MC-130 initial qualification,
requalification, or upgrade training is attendance at a formal school. USAF policy dictates the
use of formal schools unless attendance is impractical. The secondary method is in-unit training,
using applicable formal school courseware. Secondary method training (SMT) requires a waiver
be submitted through appropriate channels per this instruction and approved by MAJCOM/A3.
(NOTE: Formal schools will not forward written examinations as part of the courseware for in-
unit qualification training). Any aircrew member who was previously disenrolled from a formal
ETCA course for substandard performance is ineligible for a secondary method training waiver.
AETC is the primary source for formal training products. When AETC has no suitable products
available, MAJCOM-developed products may be used. When specific formal courseware is not
published, use of locally developed training syllabi is authorized. Units will forward all locally
developed syllabi for in-unit training to MAJCOM/A3T for review and approval.
1.4. (AETC)Aircrew Training Policy. In-unit training is not applicable to the 58 SOW for any
initial qualification, requalification, or upgrade training. Units may conduct difference training
in-unit when the ETCA does not define a specific formal difference training course.
   1.4.1. Secondary Method Training (SMT). Active duty aircrew members (primary or
   supervisory) must complete secondary method training within 180 days (12 months for Air
   Reserve Component (ARC)) from the date of their first ground training session or first flight,
   whichever occurs first. Active duty individuals will start training within 45 days of waiver
   approval (90 days for ARC). Individuals unable to complete training within these limits may
   continue training; however, their units will notify MAJCOM/A3T with a description of the
   difficulty and expected completion date (not to exceed an additional 120 days). If SMT is not
   completed by this date, any further extension requires MAJCOM/A3 approval. Commanders
   will ensure aircrew personnel engaged in qualification or requalification training complete
   their training in a timely and uninterrupted manner. Duties not directly related to
   qualification or requalification training should be minimized.
       1.4.1.1. Formal School courseware requests. For SMT, the waiver authority will include
       the appropriate formal school (58 SOW, 314 AW, 19 SOS or equivalent) as an addressee

   Air Component (CJSOAC)/CC) may:
       1.6.2.1. Extend ground training requirement due dates up to 2 months for Note 1 items in
       Table 4.2 on an individual basis only (EXCEPTION: Items referenced in para. 1.6 levied
       by other AFIs may not be waived by the OG unless specifically authorized to do so in the
       source AFI). These events may count towards the next periodic requirements (units
       should note on waiver when events were accomplished and the ARMS due date should be
       updated).
       1.6.2.2. Extend due dates for the duration of an exercise, contingency or operational
       mission for Table 4.2 events on an individual basis only if a crewmember goes overdue
       while away from home station and the training is not available at the deployed location
       (EXCEPTION: Items refer enced in para. 1.6 levied by other AFIs may not be waived by
       the OG unless specifically authorized to do so in the source AFI).
       1.6.2.3. Waive all flying training requirements (Table 4.3 and Table 4.4 except as
       otherwise noted) on an individual basis only. Wings/groups must keep an accurate record
       of waivers granted. Notify MAJCOM/A3T when waivers are issued.
   1.6.3. Unit commander may carry new crewmembers as ―mission ready‖ for up to six
   months if an aircrew member arrives on-station after a PCS and has not been qualified in all
   core mission events. This automatic waiver expires six-months after a crewmember signs
   into a unit. Squadrons have six months from the time an aircrew member signs into the unit
   to complete qualification training, otherwise the aircrew member becomes mission
   unqualified. Units may formally request an extension through HQ AFSOC/A3V or HQ
   AFSOC/A3T. Examples of core mission events which may be waived include, but are not
   limited to, personnel drops for loadmasters, airborne intercepts for EWOs, and airland
   operations for pilots. Formal schoolhouses should include restrictions on AF Forms 8 for any
   core item not trained, regardless if the method of qualification is by evaluation or instructor
   certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform core items in which they are not
   qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. This waiver does not apply to
   basic aircraft qualification events.

                                            Chapter 3

                      MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT)

3.1. Overview. This chapter establishes the minimum training requirements for completing
mission qualification , requalification, and differences training. Upon completion of mission
qualification training, the crewmember will be assigned either Basic Mission Capable (BMC) or
Mission Ready (MR) status.
3.2. General Requirements. The primary method of mission qualification or requalification is
to complete the appropriate formal training course listed in the ETCA. Completing the
appropriate formal course satisfies the training requirements of this chapter. If no requalification
course exists, conduct requalification using the initial mission qualification course. When
attendance is not practical or quotas are not available, units may request waivers to conduct
secondary method mission qualification training IAW para 1.4.1 using formal school
courseware. Any aircrew member who has previously failed to successfully complete the formal
course for substandard performance will not be issued a SMT waiver. The secondary method
requires use of formal school courseware and a waiver from the appropriate waiver authority.
This courseware establishes the minimum training requirements to meet standards specified in
AFI 11-2MC-130 Vol 2. Units may supplement formal courseware to meet local requirements.
Submit all SMT courseware change requests to AFSOC/A3T prior to implementation.
3.3. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate formal course
syllabus, the ETCA, AFI 11-202 Vol 1, and this instruction. The formal school syllabus
designates the course prerequisite approval authority.
   3.3.1. This does not preclude simultaneous basic qualification and mission qualification
   training. Simultaneous/Concurrent Multiple-MDS qualification upgrades will not be
   accomplished.
   3.3.2. For the minimum requirements to be trained as a mission Aircraft Commander, refer
   to Table 5.1 If the requirements of the table are not met, train and evaluate the individual as a
   mission CP unless excepted below.
       3.3.2.1. Prior Qualified Pilots (PQP), e.g. First Assignment Instructor Pilot (FAIP),
       Operational Support Aircraft (OSA), etc with at least 800 hours total flying time may,
       with AFSOC A3 approval, be trained in the left seat and evaluated as a Mission Pilot
       (MP). PQP pilots trained as an MP with less than the required Table 5.1 C-130
       experience will fly in-unit as a MC until they have the required Primary Mission Aircraft
       Inventory (PMAI) flight time. These pilots may maintain First Pilot (FP) qualification at
       the discretion of the squadron commander. Units will follow requalification procedures in
       Chapter 4 to requalify those pilots as MPs.
       3.3.2.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD) pilots. MPD pilots will complete AFSOC
       mission qualification in the right seat.
3.4. Ground Training Requirements. Complete all ground training in Table 3.1 as part of
mission qualification training or prior to certifying individuals as mission ready. Completion of
training will establish due dates for recurring ground training required in Chapter 4. Credit any
training accomplished at a formal school. Qualified mission ready crewmembers transferred

                                           Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General Requirements.
   4.1.1. Requirements in this chapter and the RTM are the minimum flying and related ground
   training to maintain currency and the assigned training status. Individual proficiency may
   require a greater number of events. Failure to accomplish these continuation training
   requirements will not affect BMC or MR status but may entail additional training as
   determined by the SQ/CC.
   4.1.2. Training requirements may be completed on any sortie if the accrediting criteria of
   this instruction are met. Sorties and events that are compatible may be credited on the same
   flight.
   4.1.3. Aircrew members will not log continuation training requirements in events in which
   they are unqualified.
   4.1.4. Training events accomplished on a evaluation or an instructor certification (that event)
   may be credited toward the individual‘s volume requirements.
   4.1.5. Flying training events accomplished during formal training will use the course
   completion date (successful evaluation date) to establish the due dates for all subsequent
   currency and requirements. Use actual dates for ground training. Certification events trained
   to a 3C in the FTU (e.g. personnel airdrop, airborne intercepts, etc.) will use the date of the
   checkride as the initial accomplishment date.
   4.1.6. Aircraft flying training requirements may be accomplished in an aircrew training
   device (ATD) as noted in Table 4.3 and Table 4.4
4.2. Training Levels (TL ) The use of experienced based Flying Training Levels (FTLs) and
Ground Training Levels (GTLs) allows the squadron commander to prioritize training resources.
Aircrew members must meet the minimum criteria established in paragraphs 4.2.1 and Table 4.1
before assignment to the respective training level. (EXCEPTION: ARC unit commanders may
assign TLs to individuals not meeting these minimum requirements with MAJCOM/A3T
approval). When these minima are met, awarding a training level is at the sole discretion of the
squadron commander. NOTE: The aircrew member‘s availability to fly should not be a factor in
assigning FTLs.
   4.2.1. FTLs are based on minimum PAA time (total C-130 time for DSOs) and total time.
   For basic qualification FTL, PAA time will include any variant of C-130. For mission
   qualification FTL, MC-130 PAA time may include HC-130P/N and MC-130E/H/P/W time.
       4.2.1.1. FTL ―A‖-Highly experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members.
       4.2.1.2. FTL ―B‖-Experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members.
       4.2.1.3. FTL ―C‖-Inexperienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members. (All Copilots).

   4.2.2. Crewmembers may be assigned different FTLs for basic and mission qualifications
   and individual events. For example, an aircraft commander coming from EC-130s might be
   assigned basic FTL ―A‖, mission FTL ―C‖ with a caveat of FTL ―A‖ for AAR.
   4.2.3. Change of FTL. Once a semiannual period begins, personnel will not be moved to a
   level requiring fewer events until the next semiannual period.
   4.2.4. GTLs are based upon operational flying experience.
       4.2.4.1. GTL ―1‖ – Aircrew members with 5 years or greater of operational flying.
       4.2.4.2. GTL ―2‖ – Aircrew members with less than 5 years of operational flying.
4.3. Proration of Training Requirements. See AFI 11-202 Vol 1.
4.4. Recurrency and Requalification Training. Training is required whenever an aircrew
member does not meet a currency requirement in this instruction. An aircrew member will not
perform events unsupervised until training has been accomplished.
   4.4.1. Loss of Currency. Failure to accomplish events listed in the continuation training
   tables (Table 4.2 through Table 4.4) or as outlined in RTM results in a loss of currency for
   that event. Crewmembers are non-current the day after event currency expires.
       4.4.1.1. Loss of currency in any Table 4.3 event results in supervised status until
       recurrent. (Exceptions: FPs that lose left seat landing currency may fly in the right seat
       without an instructor).
          4.4.1.1.1. Crewmembers who maintain qualification in their primary aircraft and a
          ‗slick‘ C-130 variant may satisfy Table 4.3 currency requirements in either their
          primary aircraft or the C-130. If basic semiannual currency is lost (failure to complete
          the requirements of Table 4.3), it is lost for both aircraft. Lost basic semiannual
          currency may be regained in either aircraft. Crewmembers must complete at least one
          aircrew proficiency sortie in the C-130 semiannually. Failure to complete at least one
          aircrew proficiency sortie in the C-130 results in lost currency in the C-130 only and
          currency must be regained in the C-130.
       4.4.1.2. Loss of currency exceeding 6-months. Crewmembers non-current in designated
       BAQ events (Table 4.3 note 1 events) in excess of six months results in loss of BAQ.
       Crewmembers non-current in designated mission events (Table 4.4 note 1 events) in
       excess of six months results in loss of mission qualification.
   4.4.2. Regaining Currency.
 26                                    AFI112MC-130V1_AETCSUP_I 3 DECEMBER 2009


       4.4.2.1. Only Table 4.3 and Table 4.4 note 1 events require an evaluation (unqualified)
       if loss of currency exceeds 6 months (see AFI 11-202 Vol 1 para 1.7.). Other events
       require showing proficiency to an instructor in the aircraft or simulator (per simulator
       event certification letter) IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 1, para 1.6.1. to regain currency. If loss of
       currency exceeds 24 months in non-note 1 events, additional training will consist of
       ground and flight training as directed by the unit commander (training folder must be
       opened).
          4.4.2.1.1. MC-130H EWOs may regain Mountain NVG LL, Mountain TF LL, Ku
          Band TF, SCA, and Aircrew Proficiency Sortie (APS) currency under the supervision
          of an IN as long as that IN is not performing any other instructor duties at the time.
          4.4.2.1.2. A Flight Engineer (FE) may regain currency for NVG landings under the
          supervision of an NVG landing qualified IP as long as that IP is not performing any
          other instructor duties at the time.
          4.4.2.1.3. A FE may regain currency for Mountain NVG LL under the supervision of
          an mission IP, IF or IN as long as that instructor is not performing any other primary
          or instructor duties at the time.
       4.4.2.2. Aircrew non-current in special mission events which only require an instructor
       certification (Table 5.4) may regain currency by showing proficiency in that event to an
       instructor.
       4.4.2.3. Aircrew non-current more than 24 months in special mission events (Table 4.4)
       requiring an evaluation will complete all initial training and evaluation requirements for
       that special mission.
   4.4.3. Requalification Training. Crewmembers requiring requalification will accomplish
   training IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 1, applicable MAJCOM supplements, and Chapter 2,
   Chapter 3, and Chapter 5 of this instruction.
4.5. Ground Training. Table 4.2 designates ground training requirements for all aircrew
members and identifies some flight training not covered by Table 4.3 and Table 4.4 Crew
members will comply with the time periods listed for their FTL/GTL. Conduct training IAW the
referenced publications, notes in Table 4.2, and the guidance below. The governing directive or
RTM takes precedence over Chapter 4 requirements. If the AFI 11-2MDS vol 1 is also listed as
a governing directive, the most restrictive guidance should be followed.
4.5. (AETC)Ground Training. Consider Fire Extinguisher Training (G022) as ancillary
training.
   4.5.1. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events. Make-up training should be
   accomplished at the earliest opportunity. The following apply when crewmembers exceed
   due dates for Table 4.2 events.
       4.5.1.1. Grounding items. Crewmembers will not perform flight duties until the
       grounding item is satisfied.
       4.5.1.2. Supervised status items. Crewmembers will not fly without instructor
       supervision.
AFI112MC-130V1_AETCSUP_I 3 DECEMBER 2009                                                             27


      4.5.1.3. Mission Ready (MR) items. Failure to accomplish MR events in Table 4.2
      results in non-mission ready status and the individual will not deploy as a crewmember.
   4.5.2. Block Training. Each group operations training office should establish and administer
   a centralized aircrew block training session. Block training should include all recurring
   ground training required to maintain readiness.
   4.5.3. Ancillary training. The ETCA website at https://etca.randolph.af.mil lists ancillary
   training courses; each course lists the applicable target group. Reference publications provide
   guidance for accomplishment of ancillary training requirements.

NOTES:
Indented events identify dual credit items, i.e., Precision Approach is indented under AP10
therefore when AP20 is accomplished it may also credit AP10 simultaneously. Aircrew Training
Device (ATD) specific Simulator Event Certification Letter may authorize crediting semi-annual
requirements and event currency IAW Table 4.3.
1. Only these events require an evaluation if loss of currency exceeds 6 months per AFI 11-202,
Vol 1 para 1.7. See para 4.4.1.2. for evaluation requirements.
2. MC-130H EWOs will accomplish requirements as listed for navigators.
3. Applies to crewmembers who also maintain C-130E/H qualification. See paras 4.4.1. and 4.9.
for further guidance.
4.7. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) Events. The following event definitions apply to
Table 4.3, Semiannual BAQ Flying Training Requirements. Failure to accomplish currency or
volume requirements results in loss of basic aircraft currency. EXCEPTION: does not apply to
C-130E/H if it is not the crewmember‘s primary MDS. Flight Surgeons will log currency IAW
AFI 11-202 Vol 1 requirements.
   4.7.1. Aircrew Proficiency Sortie (APS) [ST14]. An aircrew proficiency sortie may be
   logged for an individual who is flying in a primary crew position and meets the following
   position specific criteria:
         4.7.1.1. Pilots must accomplish at least three events listed in Table 4.3, Table 4.4 or
         RTM flying events to log an aircrew proficiency sortie. Pilots may log more than one
         APS on multi leg missions if at least three events were accomplished on each leg/APS to
         include a full stop landing.
         4.7.1.2. Navigators may log an aircrew proficiency sortie when they monitor a departure
         and approach. Minimum flying time is 30 minutes. If more than one qualified navigator is
         on a flight, each may obtain sortie credit on the same flight provided each one occupies a
         navigator position and performs navigator duties.
            4.7.1.2.1. MC-130H EWOs will accomplish APS requirements as listed for
            navigators.
            4.7.1.2.2. Dual qualified Nav/FCOs and Sensor Operators will accomplish at least
            50% of APS from each seat. Sixty-day currency may be updated from either seat.
         4.7.1.3. Other aircrew members may credit a sortie when they perform appropriate
         preflight, in-flight, and post-flight duties in their primary crew position. Other
         crewmembers may also credit same day sorties not requiring preflight/post-flight duties
         (credit multiple sorties on multi-leg missions with full stop landings). DSOs may log an
         APS in any C-130 variant they are qualified in.

     4.7.1.4. Multiple aircraft qualified crewmembers may credit basic proficiency and/or
     mission sorties on any aircraft in which qualification is maintained. Events which can be
     credited are based on qualification held in each MDS.
     4.7.1.4. (AETC) Multiple qualified pilots may only credit Table 4.3 events flown in
     other C-130 variants.
 4.7.2. Local Proficiency Sortie (LPS) [ST15]. All Pilots - A training mission including at
 least one hour of primary or instructor time practicing instrument, transition, and emergency
 procedures. Fly maneuvers under the supervision of an IP and repeat them until an acceptable
 level of proficiency is attained or the LPS may not be credited. If the LPS is incomplete, the
 instructor will recommend whether the entire LPS or just the incomplete events must be re-
 accomplished. Instructors and flight examiners need not complete all LPS events on a single
 sortie. Credit a LPS when all events are complete. IPs and EPs are not required to fly with
 another IP to credit this event. When conditions permit, the following should be practiced by
 FP/ACs and demonstrated to CPs: simulated two engine out landings, windmill taxi starts,
 and simulated three engine takeoffs. MPD pilots maintaining left seat currency will conduct
 LPS from the left seat and should include start/taxi/takeoff. Unit commanders may add to the
 following minimum LPS sortie criteria:
     4.7.2.1. A review of boldface emergency procedures.
     4.7.2.2. Two instrument approaches (one precision, one non-precision).
     4.7.2.3. A holding pattern or procedure turn.
     4.7.2.4. A circling approach (traffic permitting).
     4.7.2.5. A simulated engine out landing.
     4.7.2.6. A simulated engine out go around.
     4.7.2.7. A Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic pattern (weather permitting).
     4.7.2.8. 100 percent, 50 percent, and no flap landings (FP/AC/IP).
 4.7.3. Emergency Procedure Event [ST94]. The purpose of this training is to improve
 crew competence during aircraft emergencies. The AC or designated representative will
 facilitate the discussion. This designated representative should be an instructor in their
 respective crew position. Conduct this training with the entire crew present (or thorough
 cross section of crewmembers) in a classroom or in flight. All crewmembers will participate
 by providing inputs/feedback. ACs should fully discuss onset indications, boldface items if
 applicable, and in-flight/landing or ditching/ground egress procedures. Upon completion of
 this discussion, crewmembers should understand the nature of the emergency and how the
 emergency procedure applies to their crew position. Only one emergency procedure is
 required to log this event.
 4.7.4. Pilot Proficiency Events [AP10/AP12/AP20/AP21/AP30/AP35/AP40/AP60/
 LD00/LD05/LD60/TO00/TO05]. Accomplish events IAW AFI 11-217, Instrument Flight
 Procedures. AP12/20/21/60 will dual log AP10. AP12 may dual log AP20 or AP21. AP60

       due to geographic or equipment limitations, a Bearing Directional Heading Indicator
       (BDHI) only Very High Frequency Omni-directional Range Navigation System (VOR)
       approach (MC-130H bearing pointer only) may be substituted for this requirement.
       4.7.4.3. Backup Instrument Approach [AP12] (MC-130H only). Perform an approach
       using the backup instruments. May dual log with Precision or Non-Precision approach.
       4.7.4.4. Left Seat Landing [LD60]. MPD pilots who maintain left seat currency, at the
       discretion of the squadron commander, will accomplish 6 landings from the left seat each
       semiannual period.

NOTES:
Only note 1 events require an evaluation (mission unqualified) if loss of currency exceeds 6 months
(see AFI 11-202 Vol 1 para 1.7). Other events require showing proficiency to an instructor IAW AFI
11-202 Vol 1 para 1.6.1 to regain currency. Aircrew Training Device (ATD) specific Simulator Event
Certification Letter may authorize crediting semi-annual requirements and event currency IAW Table
4.4.
1. Non-Currency this event results in loss of mission currency.
2. Non-Currency in any event in this sub area results in loss of currency only for this sub area.
3. Non-Currency in any event in this sub area results in loss of currency only in that event.
4. FTL A crewmember event currency is 365d.
   4.8.1. Combat mission profile (CMP) [ST51]. Conduct a realistic crew-planned combat
   scenario to include a 30 minute low level route in conjunction with an Air Refueling Control
   Time (ARCT)/Time Over Target (TOT)/Time of Arrival (TOA) to an AAR (actual or
   simulated), airdrop (actual or simulated), HAR (actual or simulated), or airland event.
   Planning should include or discuss the requirements of combat planning that are not normally
   ―exercised‖ in local training sorties, such as ATOs, Line of Communication (LOC), ROE,
   threat capabilities/countertactics etc. TOT/TOA criteria for airland or airdrop is +/- 30
   seconds. ARCT criteria for HAR is on time to one minute late. ARCT criteria for AAR is one

  minute early to on-time. Include a realistic threat scenario and at least one aircraft defensive
  maneuver for each event. Any mission in an actual threat environment may credit this event.
  DSOs will complete preparations for a tactical mission to include mission planning and
  provide direct CS12 ATC threat warning and/or situational awareness inputs to the crew
  during any portion of the tactical mission.
     4.8.1. (AETC) Scenarios may include tilt-rotor air refueling (TAR) as a substitute for
     helicopter air refueling (HAR).
        4.8.1.1. Mountainous NVG Low Level [NV11]. Fly a 30-minute mountainous route
        segment as part of a low level mission IAW AFI 11-2MC-130, Vol 3 and AFTTP 3-
        3.HC/MC-130. Credit this event if the topography requires significant terrain avoidance
        for 30 minutes or more. Only the pilot flying the aircraft may log the event. MC-130H
        Navs and EWOs may dual log this event.
        4.8.1.2. Mountainous Terrain Following (TF) Low Level (MC-130E/H only) [ST77]..
        Fly 30 minutes of mountainous TF low level IAW AFI 11-2MC-130, Vol 3 and AFTTP
        3-3.HC/MC-130 to credit this event. Credit this event if the topography shows significant
        terrain avoidance (TA) returns for thirty minutes or more. Pilots must perform this event
        at night or in IMC to credit. Only the pilot flying the aircraft may log the event. MC-
        130H Navs and EWOs as well as MC-130E Right and Left Navigators may dual log this
        event.
        4.8.1.3. KU-Band TF (MC-130H only) [ST78]. KU-TF is a procedural event and there
        is no minimum time required. Entry and Exit into KU-TF and one turn at a segmented
        altitude which is cleared on radar will credit the event.
        4.8.1.4. Threat or Coastal Penetration [ST74]. Accomplish IAW AFI 11-2MC-130,
        Vol 3 and AFTTP 3-3.HC/MC-130. Plan and fly the threat penetration against a
        simulated threat. A threat or coastal penetration may be credited during daylight or night
        operations (night preferred). Only the pilot flying the aircraft may log the event. MC-
        130H Navs and EWOs may dual log this event.
 4.8.2. Airland Operations. Comply with procedures IAW AFI 11-2MC-130, Vol 3, and
 AFTTP 3-3.HC/MC-130.
        4.8.2.1. Maximum Effort Takeoff [TO20] and Night Max Effort Takeoff
        [TO22]. Pilots may use maximum effort takeoffs to credit BAQ takeoff requirements.
        Copilots credit this event by performing copilot duties during a max effort takeoff.
        4.8.2.2. Maximum Effort Landing [LD20] and Night Max Effort Landing
        [LD21]. Accomplish on appropriately marked Landing Zones (LZ) of 3,500 feet or less.
        When an assault zone is not available, conduct this training to a normal runway. Simulate
        the landing to a shortfield by thoroughly briefing appropriate shortfield procedures and
        runway markings for the simulated LZ. Pilots may credit landings only when the point of
        touchdown is within the applicable 500‘ zone and the aircraft can be stopped at the
        prebriefed location or can turn off the runway at the planned exit location. Copilots credit
        this event by performing copilot duties during a max effort landing. Do not credit go-
        arounds. Pilots may use maximum effort landings to credit BAQ landing requirements.

       DATA operations; may be either Dedicated or DAMA. Transmit and receive voice AND
       data with another aircraft/ground station. Only one event may be credited per flight.
4.9. Multiple Qualifications. Refer to AFI 11-202, Vol 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation
Program, MAJCOM supplements, and AFI 11-2MDS-specific Vol 2‘s for crew positions,
evaluation requirements, and approval authority for multiple qualifications. Multiple qualified
crewmembers will have one aircraft designated as their primary aircraft (N/A DSO). Other
aircraft will be considered secondary aircraft. All AFSOC C-130 crewmembers are authorized
multiple qualification in their primary mission aircraft (i.e. MC-130, AC-130) and a ‗slick‘ C-
130 variant (includes C-130E/H, EC-130E/H and WC-130H) for BAQ. Multiple aircraft
qualified crewmembers may credit basic proficiency and/or mission sorties on any aircraft in
which qualification and currency is maintained. Events which can be credited are based on
qualification held in each MDS.
   4.9.1. Multiple qualified aircrew members must complete 100 percent of the requirements of
   Table 4.3 Multiple qualified crewmembers may complete Table 4.3 requirements in either
   aircraft, but must maintain aircrew proficiency sortie currency in each aircraft. The basic
   qualification FTL assigned to an individual should be the highest experience level (fewest
   requirements) of any aircraft in which they maintain qualification. For example, a
   crewmember qualified as mission FTL A in the MC-130P and mission FTL B in the MC-
   130E should have a FTL A basic qualification profile.
       4.9.1.1. Crewmembers who maintain basic qualification in their primary aircraft and a
       ‗slick‘ C-130 variant may satisfy the basic aircraft qualification currency requirements of
       Table 4.3 in either their primary aircraft or the C-130. If basic semiannual currency is
       lost (failure to complete the requirements of Table 4.3), it is lost for both aircraft. Lost
       basic semiannual currency may be regained in either aircraft. Crewmembers must
       complete at least one aircrew proficiency sortie in the C-130 semiannually. Failure to
       complete at least one aircrew proficiency sortie in the C-130 results in lost currency in
       the C-130 only and currency must be regained in the C-130. Pilots current in their
       primary MDS regain C-130 currency and qualification by performing a takeoff,
       approach, and landing in the C-130 to the satisfaction of an instructor. Non-pilot crew
       positions current in their primary MDS regain C-130 currency and qualification by
       performing an aircrew proficiency sortie in the C-130.
   4.9.2. Multiple qualified crewmembers who maintain Mission Ready or CMR status in more
   than one AFSOC C/MC-130 aircraft must complete semiannual mission ready flying
   requirements in Table 4.4 Multiple qualified crewmembers may accomplish mission events
   in either aircraft, but will fly at least one CMP quarterly in each aircraft in which they are
   mission qualified. When the training table for the secondary aircraft contains core mission
   events not required in the primary aircraft, crewmembers will complete required volume and
   currency for those events in their secondary aircraft. If mission flying currency is lost for the
   primary aircraft, it is lost for all aircraft and must be regained in the designated primary
   aircraft. If mission currency is lost in a secondary aircraft, it is lost only for that aircraft.
       4.9.2.1. MC-130 MR crewmembers who maintain BAQ in a C-130 variant may
       accomplish requirements of Table 4.4 as allowed in Table 4.5 AMSS may log events
       approved by the aircraft commander.
AFI112MC-130V1_AETCSUP_I 3 DECEMBER 2009                                                     45


   4.9.3. DSOs are tasked to fly on all AFSOC aircraft and will maintain universal qualification
   per IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2, AFSOC Sup 1. They will comply with each AFI 11-2MDS, Vol
   1 DSO semi-annual ground and flying training currency requirements for each aircraft in
   which qualification is held. DSOs will log a minimum of one CMP for each aircraft they
   hold qualification each semi-annual period regardless of which flying training level they are
   assigned or qualification held. C-130 Aircrew Proficiency Sorties may be logged on any
   AFSOC C-130 aircraft they are qualified in. For DSOs who maintain C-130 and vertical-lift
   qualifications, the FTL requirements will be halved for each.

                           UPGRADE/SPECIALIZED TRAINING

5.1. General. This chapter identifies the prerequisites and training requirements for qualified
aircrew members upgrading to additional levels of qualification and certification in specialized
flight events.
5.2. Aircraft Commander Upgrade. Commanders will consider experience, knowledge, and
judgment when identifying candidates. Nominees must have an in-depth knowledge of systems,
procedures, and instructions prior to entry into the upgrade program. The upgrade program is
designed to teach AC duties and responsibilities, as well as left seat mission qualification.
   5.2.1. Commanders may select mission ready CPs to be trained/certified as BAQ-only ACs.
   The individual will maintain CMR status as a CP until completion/certification as a mission
   aircraft commander.
   5.2.2. Aircraft Commander Upgrade Prerequisites. The prerequisite flying time levels for
   upgrade in Table 5.1 are based on pilots having gained the knowledge and judgment required
   to effectively accomplish the unit‘s mission. Flying experience should include left seat time
   prior to entering formal school upgrade training. AC candidates will also meet all
   prerequisites listed in the ETCA and the formal school syllabus.

are provided for AF Form 4109, Aircrew Training Folder, AF Form 4110, Comments-
CSAR/Special Operations Training Record, and AF Form 4111, CSAR/Special Operations
Training. MAJCOM approved substitute may be utilized in lieu of these forms.
6.1. (AETC)General. Units may use the forms and products included in graduate training
integration management system (GTIMS) when available.
6.2. Career Training Folder. Units will maintain a career training folder for all assigned or
attached crewmembers. All completed training records will be included in a single binder of
appropriate size to provide an accurate representation of an individual‘s long term progression
and any positive or negative trends related to their training.
   6.2.1. The name of the crewmember will be clearly posted on both the binder spine and front
   cover. The front cover must also prominently display the following statement: ―PRIVACY
   ACT INFORMATION - The information accessed through this system is FOR OFFICIAL
   USE ONLY and must be protected in accordance with the Privacy Act and AFI 33-332.‖
   Each training record within the binder will be tabbed separately to differentiate between
   programs. The binder will be divided into sections as follows:
       6.2.1.1. Section 1 - Table of Contents. This should clearly list each item contained
       within the binder and the tab where it is located. It should be kept as current and accurate
       as possible and clearly display the date of the last update.
       6.2.1.2. Section 2 - Record of Review. The training section will review the career
       training folder for accuracy and completeness annually. Annotate the date of review as
       well as the name and office symbol of the reviewing official. Include any comments or
       discrepancies noted. If an expanded explanation is necessary, use an MFR signed by the
       unit training officer. File these documents behind the record of annual review in
       chronological order with the most recent on the bottom. No annual review is required for
       crewmembers in inactive/non-flying positions. Annotate the timeframe during which the
       individual was in non-flying status in appropriate chronological space in the record of
       annual review (i.e., May 2002-Jun2005 Inactive/AFSOC Staff).
       6.2.1.3. Section 3 - Completed Training Records. This section will ideally contain all
       flight training records (qualifications, certifications, specialized mission training, etc.),
       whether they are completed in-unit or at the FTU. The records will be in chronological
       order starting with initial qualification and ending with the most recently completed
       training on the top. Each training record within the folder will be tabbed separately to
       differentiate between programs. The tabs will be numbered in order with the member‘s
       initial qualification (whether completed at the FTU or in-unit) labeled Tab #1.
   6.2.2. Career training folders are covered by the Privacy Act of 1974 and shall be used for
   official business only. Maintain folders in a secure area within the unit‘s training section.
   Only instructors and supervisors should have regular access to these records. Individuals may
   sign out their own records.
AFI112MC-130V1_AETCSUP_I 3 DECEMBER 2009                                                         53


   6.2.3. When a crewmember makes a PCS move, the squadron training section will copy the
   table of contents and record of annual review as a minimum. The unit shall seal the career
   training folder in an envelope along with the individual‘s FEF and give it to the member for
   delivery to the next duty station.
       6.2.3.1. Crewmembers PCS to an active flying assignment. The losing unit squadron
       training section will keep these documents for six months from the date the individual
       departs home station, in the event records are lost or destroyed en route.
       6.2.3.2. Crewmembers PCS to an in-active flying assignment, separating or retiring. The
       losing unit squadron training section shall keep these copies until the member arrives at
       his next flying assignment or five years (whichever is less).
6.3. Entry into Upgrade. Initiate a training folder (AF Form 4109) for ETCA formal training
courses (formal school or in-unit), mission certification, special qualification, certification
training, in-unit upgrade program to the next higher crew qualification, requalification training
(formal school or in-unit), and all corrective action or additional training. Each training folder
must include documentation of entry into the training program by the unit leadership. This will
normally consist of an entry on the first AF Form 4110 in the trainee‘s record. Units may also
substitute a copy of the minutes from an upgrade board, MFR, or other locally produced form in
place of the AF Form 4110 entry. This document must be signed by the unit operations officer or
commander.
6.4. AF Form 4109. This form is the cardstock folder used to hold all required training
documents. It is available from the pubs distribution office or by establishing an account on the
AF e-publishing homepage. It is mandatory for all basic/mission qualification training and any
special mission qualification training (leading to either a special mission evaluation or instructor
certification). Some locally developed syllabi/courseware may be approved by MAJCOM/A3T
for implementation without the AF Form 4109 on a case-by-case basis. An AF Form 4109 is also
required for corrective action as a result of an evaluation (other than end-of-course evaluations).
This requirement may be waived by the unit operations officer if corrective action is limited and
would not warrant the initiation of a training folder. The flight examiner who directed the
additional training will annotate training deficiencies on the AF Form 4110. "Active" AF Form
4109 records will be maintained in a location readily accessible to instructors/trainers,
supervisory personnel, and the individual aircrew member. Comply with the following
instructions when completing the AF Form 4109.

      instructor no doubts as to where to pick up training. Enter detailed comments whenever
      the performance level attained is below the printed RPL.
      6.5.6.2. Strengths. This section should be a brief summary of the student‘s strengths.
      Make every effort to identify useable, relevant strengths to further build a picture of
      student progression for the next instructor. There should always be some strength or
      strengths to emphasize but if the sortie does not lend itself to identifying any or none are
      honestly noted, state ―none noted.‖ If no strengths are noted, strong consideration should
      be given to awarding the student an ―unsatisfactory‖ for the training period.
      6.5.6.3. Weaknesses. This section should be a brief summary of the student‘s
      weaknesses. It should, again, contribute to the next instructor‘s ability to understand the
      proficiency level the student has attained. It should also give the student areas in which to
      strive for improvement. An honest assessment is critical but avoid being overly harsh or
      judgmental. There should always be some weakness or weaknesses to emphasize but if
      the sortie does not lend itself to identifying any or none are honestly noted, state ―none
      noted.‖ If no weaknesses are noted, strong consideration should be given to awarding the
      student an ―excellent‖ for the training period.
      6.5.6.4. Recommendations. Write primarily for the next instructor but also include
      recommendations for the student where applicable. List items the next trainer should
      emphasize or other suggestions to maximize the student‘s next training event. Enter the
      next recommended step for the student (i.e., continue with training, proceed to
      evaluation, proficiency advance, etc.).
      6.5.6.5. The individual making the entry will sign after each write-up, and print his/her
      name and crew/supervisory position. The student will initial next to the trainer‘s
      signature. This only indicates that he/she has read and understands the entry. It does not
      necessarily indicate agreement/concurrence.
6.6. AF Form 4111 / AETC Form 74. Use this form to document required maneuver item file
(MIF) and RPL. Typically, this will be a pre-printed form provided by the FTU. Locally
developed overprints may be used when formal courseware is not available. These must be
AFI112MC-130V1_AETCSUP_I 3 DECEMBER 2009                                                        57


approved by MAJCOM/A3T prior to use. Approved AF Form 4111 overprints may be posted on
the MAJCOM/A3TA website. Comply with the following instructions when completing the AF
Form 4111.
   6.6.1. Name. Self explanatory.
   6.6.2. Crew Position. For aircrew members in a program designed to advance them to a
   higher crew position, enter the qualification to which they are upgrading. For all other
   training, enter the crew position currently held.
   6.6.3. Course/Phase. Enter formal course title, if one exists, or enter a descriptive identifier
   for other types of training.
   6.6.4. Programmed Training Profile. This line should contain the sortie identifiers for each
   training event and the syllabus-directed training time.
   6.6.5. Actual Training Profile. The instructor should fill in the actual training time the
   student received.
   6.6.6. ID (AF Form 4111 only). Leave blank.
   6.6.7. Task/Topic Listing. List each MIF item number from the syllabus (if applicable) and a
   description of the task required (i.e., Safety/Judgment, Lead/Wing Responsibilities, etc.) on a
   separate line.
   6.6.8. Min Event. List the minimum number of events needed to complete training (if
   applicable).
   6.6.9. GR/PK. List the performance (P) and knowledge (K) grade attained on that sortie. On
   a preprinted form, the instructor should slash through the item if the RPL is met. If the RPL
   is not met, or is exceeded, write the actual RPL attained over the preprinted number/letter.
   Award grades IAW procedures listed on the back cover of the AF Form 4109.
   6.6.10. Required Proficiency Level. This is the final RPL the student must attain for the
   maneuver prior to recommendation for evaluation or certification. One RPL should be listed
   for each MIF item or training event.
6.7. Periodic Reviews. Operations officers will review active training folders quarterly, and
squadron training representatives will conduct a monthly review (quarterly for AFRC). Annotate
monthly and quarterly reviews with a signed entry on AF Form 4110 or on a unit developed form
placed on the top left of the training folder. In those months where a quarterly review is
completed, the monthly review is not required.
   6.7.1. At the monthly review, check that all training is correctly documented and instructor
   write-ups adequately document student performance. If errors are discovered, take immediate
   action to correct them or document reasons the errors could not be corrected (i.e., instructor
   not available for signature). Note whether the trainee is progressing in a satisfactory manner,
   identify any significant problems encountered, and recommend any adjustments to training.
   Review the time elapsed between training flights. If an excessive amount of time has elapsed
   between training rides, document the reasons (N/A AFRC).
   6.7.2. The quarterly review should focus on trainee progression. The operations officer
   should take this time to determine if students are performing up to standards and the training
 58                                    AFI112MC-130V1_AETCSUP_I 3 DECEMBER 2009


   program is meeting his goals or vision for the unit. Document any relevant findings and
   direct any changes to the training program.
6.8. Instructions for Closing Out Training Records. Close out the training record with a final
entry on the AF Form 4110, whether a training program is successfully completed or terminated
for other reasons (failure to progress, extended DNIF, etc). Both the unit training officer and the
unit ops officer must sign this entry. Units may substitute an MFR, or other locally produced
form, in place of the AF Form 4110 entry. This document must be signed by the unit training
officer and operations officer.
   6.8.1. For successful completion of training, indicate that all training has been satisfactorily
   completed, the new qualification or certification is awarded, and all records have been
   updated (to include the 4348 (or MAJCOM approved substitute), letter of Xs, FEF, and
   ARMS database as required). Also, include any restrictions (if applicable).
   6.8.2. For termination of training (for cause or unrelated factors), indicate the reasons for
   termination of the upgrade and plans to re-enter the trainee into the program again at a later
   date (if any).
6.9. Instructions for Documenting Aircrew Qualifications. Units must accurately track all
qualifications and certifications for each crewmember. This is best accomplished through a
combination of the AF Form 4348 (or MAJCOM approved substitute), a locally-generated letter
of Xs (or equivalent), and the AF Form 4324, Aviation Resource Management System Upgrade
Worksheet.
6.9. (AETC)Instructions for Documenting Aircrew Qualifications. Refer to AFI 11-202,
Volume 1/ AETC Sup, for guidance on Letters of Xs.
   6.9.1. AF Form 4348 (or MAJCOM approved substitute). Maintain the 4348 (or MAJCOM
   approved substitute) in the member‘s flight evaluation folder IAW AFI 11-2MC-130 Vol 2.
   Events requiring documentation on the 4348 (or MAJCOM approved substitute) are listed in
   Table 5.4 of this instruction.
   6.9.2. Letter of Xs. A letter of Xs is the commander‘s tool to track specialized training not
   appropriate for the 4348 (or MAJCOM approved substitute) (i.e., locally required
   certifications, and training in new equipment or procedures). Specific procedures and format
   may be determined locally, but it must contain the following minimum information:
   crewmember name, highest qualification currently held, and any specialized training
   completed (not documented elsewhere). Include any other information required by the unit
   commander.
   6.9.3. AF Form 4324. This form is the source document used to update aircrew certification,
   assign training profiles, and formal flying training dates in ARMS. The squadron Stan/Eval
   or training office will complete this form and submit to SARM personnel to assign training
   profiles when a new crewmember in-processes to the unit. Complete a new form when
   training profiles are added, aircrew certification codes change, and when formal school
   courses are completed.

Terms
Air to Air Refueling (AAR)—For the purposes of this instruction, airborne fuel onload
(simulated or actual) by C/AC/MC 130 receiver aircraft.
Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI)—Aircraft assigned to a unit to assist in maintaining
readiness. Aircraft designated as BAI assets do not receive funding or manning consideration for
the unit.
Basic Aircraft Qualification Aircrew Member—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed qualification training in the basic aircrew position and maintains aircraft currency
IAW this instruction.
AFI112MC-130V1_AETCSUP_I 3 DECEMBER 2009                                                       69


Basic Mission Capable Aircrew Member—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed mission qualification and is maintaining 50 percent of the applicable mission
qualification currency requirements of this instruction. Basic mission capable crewmembers may
perform primary crew duties on any unilateral training mission. For other missions, the unit
commander must determine the readiness of each basic mission capable crewmember to perform
primary crew duties.
Calendar Month—Requirements are due once per month and not necessarily associated with a
30/60 day requirement. For example, an aircrew member could accomplish the event on 1
February and then on 31 March the following month and still fulfill the requirement.
Conversion Training—Training is normally associated with a unit conversion to another MDS.
Conversion training requires completion of a formal school initial qualification course. For unit
conversions, when formal school courses are not available to handle the throughput, MAJCOMs
will develop, and coordinate with the training command, in-unit training plans that maximize use
of highly experienced personnel as the initial cadre.
Core Mission Events—A crewmember must be qualified in all core mission events to be
considered Mission Ready (MR) or Mission Capable (MC). To determine how non-currency in
any core mission event affects overall mission currency, refer to the aircraft‘s Mission Ready
Flying Requirements (Table 4.4). Loss of qualification in any core mission event results in loss
of overall mission qualification. A core mission event will be considered an instructor certified
event when it is not required to be evaluated on the Initial Mission Evaluation. Squadrons will
maintain at least 100 percent of their required manning as MR. AFSOC unit CC/DO will
determine the status/qualification of crewmembers in excess of 100 percent manning
requirement.
Difference Training—Training accomplished when changing between same design aircraft and
the amount of training needed for qualification does not warrant attendance at a formal
qualification course.
Direct Support Operator (DSO)—An AFSOC aircrew position responsible for providing threat
warning and enhanced situational awareness to SOF missions utilizing intelligence data and
expertise in the area of operations.
Dual Qualified—A crewmember who is qualified in more than one crew position in the same
MDS.
Event—A training item to be accomplished. Multiple events may be completed and logged
during a sortie unless specifically excluded elsewhere in this instruction.
Formal School Courseware—Training materials and programs developed for training aircrew
members at formal schools. It includes all student study guides, workbooks, computer-based
training lessons, instructor guides, and AF Form 4111, Individual Mission Grade Record, related
to the specific course.
Formation Operations—Accomplish IAW applicable volume(s) of AFTTP, AFI 11-2MC-130
Vol. 3, TO 1-1C-1-20, and TO 1-1C-1-29. AFSOC guidance will never be less restrictive than
the formation definitions found in AFI 11-202, Vol 3, ―Formation Flight‖, ―Nonstandard
Formation‖, and ―Standard Formation‖. Formation operations place all aircraft in a critical phase
of flight which requires constant vigilance, strict discipline, and polished crew coordination for
 70                                    AFI112MC-130V1_AETCSUP_I 3 DECEMBER 2009


mission accomplishment. Training will ensure aircrew can think and plan for multiple aircraft
instead of single ship operations.
Infrared Detection System (IDS)—A passive navigation/sensor system which detects radiant
infrared energy.
Instructor Certified Events—Training given to an aircrew member that requires an instructor
to certify the student's attainment of the required proficiency and knowledge levels as specified
in courseware and, if appropriate, AF Form 4111. Instructor certified events are documented in
AF Form 4348 (or MAJCOM approved substitute).
Mission Design and Series (MDS) for Aircraft—The official designation for aerospace
vehicles used to represent a specific category of aerospace vehicles for operations, support, and
documentation purposes.

                                         Attachment 2
        CHEMICAL DEFENSE TASK QUALIFICATION TRAINING (CDTQT)

A2.1. General. This attachment contains the initial and recurring aircraft CDTQT requirements
for AFSOC aircrews. The purpose of CDTQT is to reinforce the crewmember's awareness of
limitations and demonstrate physiological effects while wearing the aircrew chemical defense
ensemble (ACDE). The complications of heat exhaustion, fatigue, hyperventilation, limited
dexterity, and hampered communication can all be experienced during CDTQT. All aircrew
members must complete initial aircrew life support chemical defense training prior to
accomplishing initial CDTQT. Complete initial disaster preparedness training for the ground
ensemble prior to CDTQT if the ground ensemble is used. Initial CDTQT should be done in the
aircraft and also done in the aircraft at least every four years. If initial CDTQT is done in the
simulator, the next event must be logged in the aircraft. All other times the event may be
accomplished in the simulator. Accomplishing the event in the aircraft dual logs normal CDTQT.
A2.2. CDTQT Procedures:
   A2.2.1. Accomplish CDTQT inflight using the primary unit aircraft. Crewmembers will
   perform primary crew duties while wearing the ACDE. All inflight profiles must be a
   minimum of 1 hour and accomplished on training missions only. Accomplish CDTQT in the
   simulator using primary unit aircraft WSTs. All simulator profiles must be a minimum of 2
   hours and flown on full tactical simulation profiles. This should include a threat scenario and
   aircraft emergencies. Flying the simulator profile with the entire crew wearing ACDE is
   highly encouraged.
   A2.2.2. The entire ACDE need not be used. Normally, wear the filter pack, cotton gloves,
   butyl rubber gloves, nomex gloves, and the protective hood, along with the CBO
   mask/AERPS and helmet (if applicable). Either the ACDE or ground ensemble may be worn
   during aircraft preflight. Ground ensembles will come from training assets.
   A2.2.3. When wearing the CBO mask, do not accomplish CDTQT when required to wear
   NVGs. When wearing AERPS, NVG events will be accomplished.
   A2.2.4. An observer is required to monitor each crewmember while accomplishing CDTQT
   inflight. An instructor or flight examiner in each respective crew position, not wearing the
   chemical defense components, will act as the observer for initial CDTQT. EXCEPTION: An
   IP not wearing the ensemble and not performing any other instructor duties may act as the
   observer for initial FE training. During recurring CDTQT, if the crewmember can be directly
   observed by another primary crewmember, a dedicated observer is not required. The
   dedicated observer during recurring CDTQT may also wear AERPS for all crew positions
   except pilots (two non-pilot crewmembers wearing AERPS may observe one another).
   Additionally, for safety purposes, one crewmember in the back of the aircraft must not be
   wearing AERPS in case of smoke and fumes. For any airdrop mission a fully qualified
   loadmaster must not be wearing AERPS in case of an airdrop malfunction. Example: during
   an MC-130E flight with a full mission crew complement, all crewmembers, with the
   exception of one mission pilot occupying a pilot seat and one crewmember in the back, may
   wear AERPS if all of these crewmembers have previously completed initial CDTQT. If this
   is an airdrop mission, the crewmember in the back must be a loadmaster. Dedicated
   observers not wearing AERPS for non-pilot crewmembers are not required in this case.
AFI112MC-130V1_AETCSUP_I 3 DECEMBER 2009                                                   73


       A2.2.4.1. An instructor or flight examiner pilot not wearing the chemical defense
       components will occupy the opposite seat during initial pilot CDTQT. During recurring
       CDTQT, a mission qualified pilot not wearing the chemical defense components will act
       as the observer and occupy the opposite seat. With squadron commander approval, both
       pilots may wear AERPS while occupying the pilot seats provided both pilots have
       accomplished CDTQT within the past 90 days. The squadron commander may delegate
       this authority to the operations officer or mission commander.
       A2.2.4.2. Observers will closely monitor crewmembers actions during CDTQT. If a
       crewmember experiences difficulties such as excessive thermal stress, headaches,
       hyperventilation, nausea, etc., the crewmember will remove the ensemble. The observer
       will notify the AC of any difficulties encountered.
A2.3. Crewmembers will accomplish a profile that includes terrain following (if equipped) or
NVG low level and either an airland, airdrop, or helicopter air refueling event. Do not credit
simulated events. In addition:
   A2.3.1. Pilots will accomplish a minimum of one approach and landing. Pilots may
   accomplish CDTQT in either seat.
   A2.3.2. FEs will accomplish inflight duties including running any checklists accomplished
   from before starting engines through after landing.
   A2.3.3. All other crewmembers will credit CDTQT while performing their normal crew
   duties during the specified events.
