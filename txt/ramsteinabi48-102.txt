This instruction implements AFPD 48-1, AFI 48-148, Ionizing Radiation Protection, AFI 40-
201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the USAF, AFI 91-108 and USAFE Supplement 91-
108, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Intrinsic Radiation Safety Program, and AFMAN 48-125, US
Air Force Personnel Dosimetry Program. This instruction specifies the requirements for
protection of 435th Air Base Wing (ABW) and 86th Airlift Wing (86 AW) personnel and their
dependents from ionizing radiation, as well as supported units. It also specifies requirements to
protect the general public from exposure to ionizing radiation resulting from United States Air

working at Ramstein Air Base, as well as 435 ABW annexes and support sites. It does not apply
to exposure of patients during diagnostic or therapeutic medical procedures. Implementation of
this safety program, and the As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) concept must not
compromise weapons safety, security, reliability, or operational mission considerations. Ensure
that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in Air Force Records
Management Systems (AFRIMS): https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61/afrims/afrims/index.cfm
