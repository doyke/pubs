This instruction implements and extends guidance from AFI 13-201, Air Force Airspace Management,
dated 21 September 2001. This instruction establishes guidelines and procedures to follow when non-ion-
izing radiation (NIR) emissions are planned at Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) or on the Western
Range (WR). This instruction applies to all military and contractor agencies operating equipment which
emits NIR. The source of emissions may be from radar, laser or other type of transmitter. During certain
test and operations on the WR, there are requirements to emit and control NIR. This instruction delineates
and prescribes responsibilities of the 30th Space Wing (30 SW) and its subordinate units for analysis,
coordination and the application of procedures to ensure the safety of personnel and equipment. Refer rec-
ommended changes and questions about this instruction to 2 ROPS/DON, 1602 California Blvd, Suite
146 VAFB CA 93437-5233 using AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publications. Ensure
that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance
with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://

       sions into space that are a potential threat to space resident objects.
       3.2.6. Coordinate with the mission Aeronautical Operations Control Officer (AOCO) to ensure
       the AOCO is the focal point for all direct interfaces with the user during any operation.
          3.2.6.1. Ensure the RDZ provided by the Range User and approved by 30 SW/SE is clear dur-
          ing the operation (land, sea, and air).
          3.2.6.2. The AOCO terminates the operation whenever safety parameters are exceeded or an
          imminently dangerous situation is observed.
    3.3. 30 CES/CEV will:
       3.3.1. Provide guidance and assistance to the range user on environmental requirements and pro-

       ments to ensure safety of personnel or equipment.
       3.4.3. Evaluate and determine if Range User submitted safety criteria and operation control plans,
       including requirements for personnel, equipment protection, evacuation, and surveillance of the
       RDZ.

       ates a potential hazard to mariners and/or aircraft.
       3.4.8. Ensure Range User/Equipment Operator emergency procedures are adequate to respond to
       an accident involving NIR.

      gerous situation is detected.
   3.5. The 30 CES/CECBR will:
      3.5.1. Provide 2 ROPS/DON with information concerning leased land tracts affected by the RDZ
      so that evacuation notices to clear personnel or livestock can be issued. Information will include:
