     2.7. Direct all off base and tenant units on Westover to the gatekeepers of the base Sentry
     Program (439 LRS/LGRDX) for all unit functions occurring on base to ensure proper
     coordination. Inform them that they must submit a memorandum two (2) weeks prior to the
     event for approval to include, date/time/POC name and number. Once approved through
     Sentry Program it will be placed in the reservation book and confirmed.
3. Requesting Activities.
     3.1. All 439 AW units must schedule fitness assessments and group activities with the
     Westover Fitness Center a minimum of five days in advance of the planned event.
     Memorandum must include a point of contact for the event, phone number, date and time of
     the activity, type of activity, number of participants, and all equipment and assistance
     required by the Fitness Center staff. Confirmation will be obtained by calling (413) 557-3958
     or DSN: 589-3958 prior to the scheduled activity.
     3.2. A minimum of one water point will be set up along the walking, marching, running, or
     exercise area, trail or path.
     3.3. Communications to the Fire Department will be established ensuring the ability to
     communicate to the rescue squad, if necessary. A cell phone can accomplish this with an
     emergency number (413-557-1117) pre-programmed. If cell phones are not available, two-
     way radios may be requested from the Fire Department.
     3.4. Provide two monitors (must have current CPR certification) for all fitness assessments
     involving aerobic activity; i.e., walking, running, or jogging. The monitors are responsible to

  lead/follow the group in vehicles. This procedure ensures visual contact with everyone in the
  group.
  3.5. All leaders of units, groups, organizations or parties will ensure that the rules of the
  facility, area, or grounds of which they are using are followed.
  3.6. At no time will a group, unit, organization or party be left alone without proper
  supervision from an officer, non-commissioned officer, group leader or supervisor for that
  group. Note: Military recruiters (all services) are responsible for the conduct and safety of
  individual applicants, military or naval academy freshmen, delayed entry personnel, young
  marines and potential recruits, and therefore, must be present at all times during their
  utilization of facilities and grounds.
