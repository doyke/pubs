Introduction Note: Experience and history have shown that actions taken during an emergency,
contingency, or disaster response, as well as recovery actions, are much more effective if
planned. Plans help units respond to a crisis and minimize the time it takes to organize and begin
recovery actions. The longer it takes a unit to react effectively, the greater the potential for loss
of life and USAF resources. Plans help focus our efforts so we do the right things quickly and
the most important things first. When more than one person is involved, plans help sort out who
does what and when. Plans, operating instructions, and checklists are commonly considered the
products of planning. When preparing plans, never forget that personnel organized, equipped,
and trained to respond to a variety of contingencies are the most important “product” of planning

1. Program Elements:
   1.1. Plans Summary. The Plans Summary is designed to provide a condensed reference of
   all AETC contingency plans. The summary outlines HQ AETC plans and all wing-level
   plans required by HQ AETC or Headquarters, United States Air Force (HQ USAF)
   directives. AETC wing plans officers will publish a base plans summary adapted to their
   base. The base plans summary will be reviewed annually and updated as necessary. AETC
   tenant organizations will provide plans information for the host unit summary.
       1.1.1. AETC Contingency Plans Listing. Every January, HQ AETC/A3OX will publish
       a listing of AETC contingency plans. The listing includes all plans published by HQ
       AETC and all wing plans required by HQ AETC or HQ USAF plans and directives. This
       listing is provided to assist wing plans officers and applicable HQ AETC staff OPRs with
       plan development and management. The listing may be accessed via the HQ
       AETC/A3OX                Community            of          Practice      (CoP)         at
       https://www.my.af.mil/afknprod/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-OP-AE-
       97.
       1.1.2. To assist HQ AETC/A3OX in updating the AETC contingency plans listing, all
       HQ AETC directorates who require wings to prepare base-level or supporting plans will
       review their requirements and provide updates to AETC/A3OX by December to ensure
       currency of the listing.
2. Responsibilities:
   2.1. HQ AETC Functional Staff:
       2.1.1. Publish the initial contingency plan and all changes and revisions.
       2.1.2. Review base-level contingency plans for accuracy of content within 45 days of
       plan publication.
       2.1.3. Provide guidance to subordinate units on contingency plans for which they are
       responsible.

       2.1.4. Monitor suspenses for base-level contingency plan publication and distribution.
    2.2. HQ AETC/A3OX:
       2.2.1. Determine plan format.     If not specified by other directives, use the format
       presented in this instruction.
       2.2.2. Accomplish and distribute AETC Contingency Plans Listing in January of each
       year.
    2.3. Wing Plans Officers (Operational Planners):
       2.3.1. Must have a Secret clearance. If handling of classified material is required, the
       wing plans officer will also have access to SIPRnet.
       2.3.2. Review all base-level operations/contingency plans before final publication and
       distribution. AETC tenant organization plans officers will review AETC-mandated plans
       and supplements to host-unit plans.
          2.3.2.1. (Added-KEESLER) Prior to submission to the Wing Commander or higher
          headquarters, 81 TRW/XPO will review all plans and changes. The 81 TRW
          Commander is the approving authority for all newly developed and major revisions to
          war and contingency plans. A major revision is one in which tasking has been
          changed or additional requirements, as directed by higher headquarters, have been
          included. The Vice Commander, 81 TRW/CV, is the approving authority for minor
          revisions and changes. A minor revision is one, in which administrative changes,
          such as office symbol changes and additional or supplemental guidance are made.
       2.3.3. If serving as OPR for a plan, coordinate on and delegate responsibilities for
       preparation of functional area inputs. The OPR is determined by the source document
       requiring the plan or by the wing commander. Normally, the base OPR will be
       functionally aligned with the HQ AETC OPR.
       2.3.4. Provide training for newly-assigned AETC and tenant organization plans
       representatives within 30 days of appointment. AETC tenant organization plans officers
       need only brief newly assigned AETC plans representatives. Items covered should
       include key responsibilities, plans format, plans review, staff assistance visits (SAVs),
       and local considerations.
       2.3.5. Establish a plans review program. Consideration should be given to aligning
       reviews with functional AFI requirements. In the absence of such guidance, plans will be
       reviewed at least once in a 24-month period. Plans mandated to be reviewed more
       frequently by higher headquarter directives will be reviewed accordingly. AETC tenant
       organizations will establish a similar program within their AOR.
          2.3.5.1. (Added-KEESLER) Publish and distribute the Keesler's Plans Review
          Process Guide to Unit Plans Representatives (UPRs). Update the guide as required.
       2.3.6. Conduct staff assistance visits (SAVs) at least once per calendar year with all
       AETC and tenant organizations having contingency plan requirements. Document SAV
       results and keep on file for two years. AETC tenant organizations will establish a similar
       program within their AOR.
AETCI10-401_KEESLERSUP_I 23 August 2011                                                       5


     2.3.7. Ensure all plans representatives conduct a self-inspection of their program at least
     once per calendar year. AETC tenant wings will ensure programs under their purview
     conduct self inspections at least once per calendar year.
     2.3.8. AETC host wing plans officers should strongly consider establishing a wing plans
     working group (WPWG) comprised of plans representatives from functional areas and
     tenants with support requirements. AETC tenant wing plans offices should participate in
     host wing plans working groups as necessary.
     2.3.9. Review and ensure the wing commander (or designated representative) approves
     base contingency plans.
     2.3.10. Review the current AETC Contingency Plans Listing to ensure compliance with
     plans requirements.
     2.3.11. Ensure proper distribution of base plans to tasked organizations and the
     appropriate HQ AETC functional OPR. Distribution of the wing contingency plans will
     be in accordance with the HQ AETC Contingency Plans Listing. AETC tenant wings
     will ensure correct distribution within their wing.
     2.3.12. Conduct key personnel briefings to include:
        2.3.12.1. Initial briefings on all base-level war and contingency plans for newly
        assigned key personnel within 60 days after they assume that position. The wing
        commander designates key personnel in writing (normally group and squadron
        commanders, others as desired).
        2.3.12.2. Refresher briefings on plans for designated key personnel annually.
        2.3.12.3. (Added-KEESLER) 81 TRW/XPO will                  document     briefings   and
        attendance. Key position supervisors are designated as:

          2.3.13.4. Base-level plans summary (AETC host wings only).
       2.3.14. Prepare a Wing Contingency Plans listing to include, as a minimum, plan short
       title, date published, OPR, and changes posted. Update as necessary, but at least
       annually, and distribute to all wing and tenant unit plans representatives. AETC tenant
       units will create a similar listing for their plans.
       2.3.15. Ensure all base level plans are available either by electronic means (i.e., CoP,
       SIPRnet, NIPRnet, SharePoint) or hard copy in accordance with the HQ AETC
       Contingency Plans Listing. AETC tenant wings will ensure similar availability for their
       plans.
    2.4. Unit Plans Representatives:
       2.4.1. Will be an officer or noncommissioned officer (or civilian equivalent) with at least
       a Secret clearance who is thoroughly familiar with the unit's operation and capabilities.
       Commanders should consider one year retainability as a minimum when appointing
       new plans representatives. Send a letter of appointment to the wing plans officer within
       10 workdays of appointment. (Note: Contractors authorized as the unit plans officer
       must have a security clearance to handle classified up to the Secret level.) Security
       clearances will be validated by a unit security manager and included on the letter of
       appointment.
          2.4.1.1. (Added-KEESLER) Appoint a primary and alternate UPR. Send the
          appointment memorandum to 81 TRW/XPO and update the memorandum when
          changes occur. Appointment memorandum will include names, grades, SSNs,
          security clearances, office symbols, and duty phones. When possible, appoint a new
          representative 60 days before the reassignment of a former representative.
          2.4.1.2. (Added-KEESLER) Schedule a plans representative briefing and training
          with 81 TRW/XPO within 30 days of appointment as UPR. Attend annual refresher
          training as directed by 81 TRW/XPO.
          2.4.1.3. (Added-KEESLER) Send the names of newly assigned key supervisors as
          designated in paragraph 2.3.12.3 to 81 TRW/XPO within 30 days of their assignment.
          This requirement can be included in the Crisis Action Team Staff appointment
          memorandum when applicable.
       2.4.2. If serving as OPR for a plan, coordinate on and delegate responsibilities for
       preparation of functional area inputs. The OPR is determined by the source document
       requiring the plan or by the wing commander. Normally, the base OPR will be
       functionally aligned with the HQ AETC OPR.
          2.4.2.1. (Added-KEESLER) Conduct annual plans reviews as required. Plan OPR
          initiates review to all tasked organizations. UPRs will conduct an annual review of

        to 81 TRW/XPO through the unit commander. Use sample format contained in
        Attachment 5.
     2.4.7. Conduct a self-inspection of their program at least once per calendar year.
     2.4.8. (Added-KEESLER) Use the 81 TRW War/Contingency Plans Index for the
     plans management program. The Wing Plans Office publishes an updated listing
     quarterly. Use this management tool to conduct semi-annual plans inventory. Interim
     changes are posted immediately by each UPR when a new plan or change is received.
     2.4.9. (Added-KEESLER) During the 6th month following the staff assistance visit by
     81 TRW/XPO, conduct a plans self-inspection using the Staff Assistance Visit Checklist.
     During this self-inspection, visit all work centers and subdivisions that maintain plans
     and document the results. Upon completion, prepare and forward a memorandum
     through the unit commander to indicate findings and/or discrepancies to 81 TRW/XPO.
     Ensure a copy of the completed self-inspection checklist is attached.
     2.4.10. (Added-KEESLER) Maintain a plans continuity folder containing the
     following:
        2.4.10.1. (Added-KEESLER) Table of Contents.
        2.4.10.2. (Added-KEESLER) UPR appointment letter.

           2.4.10.9. (Added-KEESLER) Miscellaneous documents.
           2.4.10.10. (Added-KEESLER) Ensure that a copy of AETCI 10-401, and this
           supplement are on hand or available for reference. An OPR for a Base Plan must
           have a printed copy of AETCI 10-401 and this supplement; electronic files will not
           suffice for OPRs.
       2.4.11. (Added-KEESLER) Each unit/agency will maintain current plans for which
       they are tasked. Ensure their unit/agency has all required 81 TRW plans on file and
       maintained in accordance with this instruction. Ensure plans are readily accessible to the
       Group Control Center (GCC), Medical Control Center (MCC), and Unit Control Center
       (UCC) as applicable.
       2.4.12. (Added-KEESLER) Ensure all plans suspense’s are met, such as requests to
       conduct annual reviews.
       2.4.13. (Added-KEESLER) When an organization has multiple copies of a plan located
       outside the organization's plans library, list the location/internal distribution of the copies
       on the inside front cover of the unit's master plan. When changes are made, the OPR will
       provide copy of the change to holders of the additional plans. Ensure only a minimum
       amount of distribution copies are requested from the plan OPR.
       2.4.14. (Added-KEESLER) Contact XPO for general plans information when
       necessary. Unit key personnel should include those individuals performing duties in the
       GCC, MCC, and UCC as applicable.
3. Wing Plans Working Group (WPWG):
    3.1. The creation of a WPWG is highly encouraged at all installations. For tenant
    organizations, membership in host-unit WPWGs is also highly encouraged. WPWG
    membership should consist of the wing plans officer and squadron/unit plans representatives.
    Consideration should be given to local, off-base subject matter experts for inclusion in the
    WPWG.
    3.2. The wing plans officer (or designated representative) should chair or facilitate the
    WPWG.
    3.3. Consider the following for discussion during WPWG meetings:
       3.3.1. Development and coordination of new plans.
       3.3.2. Discussion of current plan requirements, i.e. creation of a new plan annex
AETCI10-401_KEESLERSUP_I 23 August 2011                                                          9


       3.3.3. Review of local procedures and a “How Goes It?” seminar to ensure current plans
       satisfy requirements.
       3.3.4. Introduction of new plans representatives.
4. Staff Assistance Visits:
   4.1. Wing staff assistance visits are an integral part of a comprehensive wing plans
   surveillance program. Conduct staff assistance visits at least annually. The squadron
   commander (or equivalent) of the AETC or tenant organization will respond in writing to the
   wing plans officer indicating corrective actions taken. Report open items to wing plans
   officer every 30 days until the corrective action is completed. Wing plans officers will:
       4.1.1. Publish a proposed staff assistance visit schedule for the entire calendar year.
       4.1.2. Confirm visit with the squadron commander (or equivalent) of each AETC and
       tenant organization before the visit to establish time, date, and purpose.
   4.2. Staff assistance visits must be task-oriented and not primarily administrative in nature.
   Consider the following items for review during SAVs.
       4.2.1. Review to ensure plans adequacy.
       4.2.2. Review of all plans to ensure that supervisors are aware of, and can support,
       specific functional area tasking.
       4.2.3. Review of all tasked plans on file for currency.
       4.2.4. Actions for preparing plans.
       4.2.5. Review of functional area Crisis Action Team (CAT), or Installation Control
       Center (ICC) checklists for currency and adequacy.
       4.2.6. Review of classification procedures. (Ensure actions listed in checklists, operating
       instructions, etc., are classified properly.)
   4.3. During staff assistance visits, items discussed must be documented to include
   deficiencies noted, actions taken, open items, and those corrected on the spot. Highlight
   recurring deficiencies. Provide a formal reply to the squadron commander of the AETC or
   tenant organization visited. Unit plans representatives will keep copies of staff assistance
   visit reports on file for two years.
5. Plan Organization:
   5.1. Identifying Plans. Wing plans offices will assign a number and or title to their base
   contingency plans to coincide with the number and or title of the HQ USAF or AETC plans
   they support or as specified by higher headquarters or other governing directives.
   5.2. Plan Format. Wing supporting plans are written in the format of the plan supported or
   as prescribed in a higher headquarters directive. When developing plans that have no
   prescribed format, use the format in AFMAN 10-401, Volume 2, as a guide. Annex
   designations listed in Attachment 2 are a guide only and may be realigned as required.
       5.2.1. (Added-KEESLER) Margins. Ensure the following minimum requirements are
       observed. One inch top margin. One inch left and right margins. One and one-quarter
 10                                          AETCI10-401_KEESLERSUP_I 23 August 2011


       inch bottom margin. (This will allow space for page numbering and security markings if
       applicable.)
       5.2.2. (Added-KEESLER) Font. Use the same typing element consistently throughout
       the plan. Required font is Times New Roman, size 12, for text material to aid in ease of
       readability.
       5.2.3. (Added-KEESLER) Heading (see figure 5.1.). On all 81 TRW plans, type the
       following on the top right corner of the first page of each annex, appendix or tab, one
       inch from the top:

OPR:
Date
Original
   5.3. Organization of a Plan. All plans should include these elements in the order listed,
   unless specified otherwise in higher headquarters directives:
       5.3.1. Plan Covers. The cover must show the date of the plan, the issuing headquarters,
       short title and number of the plan; proper security classification, administrative markings,
       and caveats; source of classification; and downgrading or declassification instructions.
       Covers must not contain classified information. Mark top and bottom of both covers with
       the overall classification of the plan. Card stock covers may be used on all plans.
       Classified plan covers must be red or pink.
           5.3.1.1. (Added-KEESLER) 81 TRW plan covers must include basic information
           and must also include the OPR and the long title. Recommend print job order include
           three hole punch at left margin. Also, light blue card stock should be used for cover
           and back. (See Plan Cover Example at Attachment 6 of this supplement.)
       5.3.2. Letter of Transmittal. The letter of transmittal of a contingency plan should
       identify the reason for preparing the plan. The need for preparing further supporting
       plans must be specified. The OPR for the plan must be identified and disposition
       instructions must be included when the plan supersedes a previous plan.
           5.3.2.1. (Added-KEESLER) See          Memorandum        of    Transmittal,   Sample   in
           Attachment 7 of this supplement.
       5.3.3. Security Instructions and Record of Changes. The security instructions must
       include the long and short titles of the plan and must be the first page (i) following the
       letter of transmittal. State the classification of the plan and any reproduction limitations.
       The record of changes for the plan may be included on the same page as the security
AETCI10-401_KEESLERSUP_I 23 August 2011                                                      11


     instructions, or may be a separate page published on the back of the security instructions.
     Reproduction and limitation instructions are included on the "Security Instructions" page.
        5.3.3.1. (Added-KEESLER) See Security Instructions (with Record of Changes
        and Record of Review) at Attachment 8 of this supplement.
     5.3.4. Classification Guidance. The classification guidance page lists subjects requiring
     protection (e.g. operational code words, concept of operations, etc.), if any, and the time
     period during which the protection is required (e.g. planning phase, execution phase,
     post-event phase).
     5.3.5. Plan Summary. The plan summary is used for all contingency plans. It provides
     a concise description of the purpose to be achieved by implementing the plan. It also
     provides a brief review of conditions for implementation, operations to be conducted,
     assumptions, operational constraints, command relationships, logistics requirements,
     limiting factors, and commander's appraisal of the logistics and transportation feasibility
     of the plan.
        5.3.5.1. (Added-KEESLER) See Plans Summary, Sample at Attachment 9 of this
        supplement.
     5.3.6. Table of Contents. See attachment 2. Annex designations are a guide only and
     may be realigned when necessary to fit specific needs. The table of contents should
     include elements that are published separately.
     5.3.7. Basic Plan. The basic plan consists of the seven main paragraphs shown in
     attachment 3. Additional paragraphs may be included to fit the needs of the plan. The
     basic plan shall be signed by the wing commander or designated representative.
     5.3.8. Attachments to the Plan. Annexes used for the plan shall be listed on the final
     page of the basic plan. Other attachments (appendices, tabs, exhibits, or maps) shall be
     listed on the final page of any attachment which has further attachments. The basic plan
     shall refer to each annex that has been prepared; however, information provided in the
     basic plan is not normally repeated in the attachments. Annexes shall be signed by the
     functional area chief charged with overall responsibility for the annex. See Attachment 4
     for a sample annex.
        5.3.8.1. (Added-KEESLER) See Annex Sample at Attachment 10, Appendix
        Format at Attachment 11 and Tab, Sample at Attachment 12 of this supplement.
     5.3.9. Execution Checklist. The execution checklist summarizes the action required by
     the commander preparing the plan to ensure coordinated initiation of operations.
     5.3.10. Distribution List. The distribution list accounts for all copies of the plan and
     informs users which agencies and headquarters maintain copies of the plan. Distribution
     should be held to the minimum essential for planning. Addressees must advise plan
     OPRs of necessary changes to the distribution list.
        5.3.10.1. (Added-KEESLER) See Distribution Annex Z, Sample at Attachment 13
        and Distribution Change/Receipt Memorandum Sample at Attachment 14 of this
        supplement.

     5.3.11. Distribution Change Memorandum. All plans shall include a standard
     memorandum that addressees may use to notify the OPR of changes in distribution
     requirements. The distribution change memorandum usually follows the distribution list
     but may also follow the memorandum of transmittal.
        5.3.11.1. (Added-KEESLER) See Change Memorandum Sample at Attachment 15
        to notify those on the distribution list (Annex Z) of changes to a plan.
     5.3.12. (Added-KEESLER) Use AF Form 2519, Plans Development Quality
     Assurance Checklist, at Attachment 16 as a guide during plan changes or rewrites.
  5.4. Change Procedures:
     5.4.1. When to Issue a Change. A plan shall be changed rather than revised if the total
     adjustments (any new or previously changed material) affect less than 40 percent of the
     plan.
     5.4.2. Identifying Changes:
        5.4.2.1. The date of the change, the date of the basic plan, and the classification of
        the plan (if other than unclassified) must be included in paragraph 1 of the letter of
        transmittal.
        5.4.2.2. A copy of the distribution list must be attached to the letter of transmittal. If
        a new annex Z is accomplished, a distribution list is not required. The "To" element
        should read: "See Attached Distribution List" or "See Annex Z."
        5.4.2.3. When page changes are made, the change number and the date of the change
        shall be placed in parenthesis below the page number.
     5.4.3. Change Methods:
        5.4.3.1. Page Changes. This is the preferred method of change. This method re-
        accomplishes all pages containing changes. If the change contains classified material,
        two copies of AF Form 1565, Entry, Receipt, and Destruction Certificate, are
        prepared according to DoD Regulation 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, and
        AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.
        5.4.3.2. Write-In Changes. Write-in changes (in ink) are permissible but shall not
        be used to make lengthy changes. This procedure may be used only for minor
        corrections, such as changes to numbers, dates, single words, short phrases, etc. If
        page changes are also being made, the write-in changes are either included on the AF
        Form 1565, if used, or listed on the change letter of transmittal.
            5.4.3.2.1. (Added-KEESLER) Plan Change Processing Procedures.                See
            Attachment 15 for change format letter for pen and ink changes with page inserts.
            5.4.3.2.2. (Added-KEESLER) Hold pen-and-ink changes to a minimum. Use
            page changes rather than pen-and-ink changes for lengthy or complex changes.
     5.4.4. Change Transmittal. A transmittal letter is prepared for each change and the
     change is distributed to all addressees listed in Annex Z.
     5.4.5. (Added-KdodEESLER) File changes in front of the plan, immediately following
     the front cover, with the latest change on top. Use blue or black ink to post all changes.
AETCI10-401_KEESLERSUP_I 23 August 2011                                                        13


     Reference the change number in the left margin of the same line that is changed. Enter
     the change data in the Record of Changes list in the front of the plan.
  5.5. Security and Document Marking Considerations:
     5.5.1. Classified contingency plans shall be marked according to DoD Regulation
     5200.1-R, AFI 31401, and as follows:
        5.5.1.1. Each plan must be assigned an overall security classification that is
        determined by its content.
        5.5.1.2. Front and back covers and the letter of transmittal shall be marked with the
        overall classification of the plan. The final paragraph of the letter of transmittal shall
        indicate whether the letter of transmittal, when classified attachments are withdrawn,
        is Secret, Confidential, or Unclassified. Any transmittal letters remaining classified
        after attachments are withdrawn must be portion marked and include the "Classified
        by" and "Declassify on" instructions.
        5.5.1.3. The first page of each plan element (the annex, the appendix, the tab, etc.,)
        shall bear the highest classification of any other portion of that element only if the
        element is likely to be used separately. For example, if only the second page of tab B
        contains classified information, the front page of tab B will bear the classification of
        page 2 only if the tab is likely to be removed and used as a separate entity. If not,
        then only page 2 will bear classified markings and the front page of the tab will
        remain unclassified. This also applies to any special markings required because of
        the nature of the information it includes; for example, "Restricted Data."
        5.5.1.4. Each interior page of the classified plan element shall be marked according
        to the highest classification of the information contained on the page, or
        "Unclassified" as appropriate. Center classification markings at the top and bottom of
        each page. Each paragraph and sub-elements of paragraphs must be portion marked
        (TS), (S), (C), or (U) according to the highest level of information contained in or
        revealed by it. EXCEPTION: When the entire annex, appendix, tab, etc., is
        unclassified, portion marking is not required. Place the statement: "This entire
        (annex, appendix, tab, etc.,) is unclassified" on the first page and mark
        "UNCLASSIFIED" at the top and bottom of it and each page of the unclassified
        attachment.
        5.5.1.5. The first page of a classified plan element must contain markings for
        identifying a derivative classification as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.1-R and
        AFI 31-401. Identification of the classification authority must be shown on the
        "Classified by" line. The "Declassify on:" line must reflect the date the document is
        to be declassified (normally 10 years from date of the document). Refer to DoD
        5200.1-PH, DoD Guide to Marking Classified Documents, for additional
        declassification instructions.
     5.5.2. AETCPAM 33-301, Employees Responsibilities under the Freedom of Information
     Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act (PA), shall be reviewed by plan OPRs to determine if a
     plan falls under its purview. Marking, handling, and disposition of plans determined to
     be "For Official Use Only" will be in accordance with AETCPAM 33-301.
