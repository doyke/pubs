13. Security.
13.1. Security will be afforded to munitions as specified in MAFBI 11-204, Hazardous Cargo
Laden Aircraft Supporting Instruction.
13.1.1. For on-base and off-base movements, at least one person must be armed if moving high-
or medium-risk munitions or more than 5,000 rounds of small arms ammunition.
13.1.2. All weapons/munitions movements must be coordinated with SFCC and ATOC prior to,
and at completion of, each movement.
13.1.2.1. SFS will normally provide armed escort; however, any properly trained and authorized
personnel may perform these duties.
13.1.3. The SFS escort will be released after the shipment has been accepted by MSA or APS
personnel.
13.2. All signature transfers of custody must be completed and properly documented prior to
moving cargo requiring such service. Additionally, necessary precautions must be taken to
effectively safeguard all other DoD arms ammunition and explosive assets.
13.3. The possibility of covert or overt attack against munitions is always present; therefore,
only essential personnel are allowed near the explosive-handling operations area. Challenges
must be made to obtain the identity of anyone unknown within the immediate vicinity of the
explosive-handling operations area.
14. Vehicle Breakdown or Accident.
14.1. Vehicle breakdown.
14.1.1. Move the vehicle as far off the road and away from populated areas as possible.
Consider transferring explosives to another vehicle for immediate removal.
14.1.2. Maintain security of the munitions.
14.1.3. Place reflectors out in the direction of approaching traffic. DO NOT USE ROAD
FLARES!
14.1.4. Notify the following agencies:
14.1.4.1. Command Post and ATOC Duty Officer. Contact 305th Logistics Readiness Squadron
(LRS) only if replacement vehicle or repair service is required.
14.1.5. Take appropriate action within the scope of operator maintenance to repair vehicle and
eliminate hazards as soon as possible.
14.2. Vehicle accident.
14.2.1. If in dangerous conditions, EVACUATE all nonessential personnel and establish a
hazard cordon IAW Table 1. Direct traffic, as required, until law enforcement agencies arrive.
