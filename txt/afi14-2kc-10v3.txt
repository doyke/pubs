This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 14-2, Intelligence Rules and
Procedures, and is consistent with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 14-202, Volume 1, Intelligence
Training, AFI 14-202, Volume 2, Intelligence Standardization/Evaluation Program, and AFI 14-
202, Volume 3, General Intelligence Rules. This publication establishes the minimum Air Force
standards for training personnel performing intelligence duties in KC-10 units. This publication
applies to Regular Air Force (RegAF), Reserve and Air National Guard (ANG) intelligence
personnel supporting KC-10 operations. The National Guard Bureau will be considered
functionally as a major command (MAJCOM) for the purposes of this publication. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). This AFI may be supplemented, but all
supplements must be coordinated with the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) prior to
certification and approval. Refer recommended changes to the OPR using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication. Route AF Forms 847 through the appropriate
functional chain of command. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this
publication are identified with a tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance
statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, for a description of the
authorities associated with the tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the chain of
command to the appropriate tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the publication OPR
for non-tiered compliance items.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change adds risk factors, known as “tiers” to tasks assigned to organizations below
major command (MAJCOM) level to depict the assessed risk of non-compliance. It also deletes
references to Statement of Intelligence Interest (SII) as the term is outdated and re no longer a
requirement. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.

     operations. With the complementary references cited, this volume prescribes standard
     operational procedures to be used by all Mobility Air Force (MAF) KC-10 intelligence
     personnel. These operational procedures are the minimum and can be supplemented by
     additional unit-level written guidance. Unit-level written guidance may expand these basic
     procedures, but in no case will they be less restrictive.
     1.1.2. References. The primary references for KC-10 intelligence operations are AFI 14-
     2KC-10, Volume 1, KC-10 Unit Intelligence Training, AFI 14-2KC-10, Volume 2, KC-10
     Unit Intelligence Evaluation Criteria, Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures
     (AFTTP) 3-1.Threat Guide, AFTTP 3-1.KC-10, AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 1, KC-10 Aircrew
     Training, AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 3, KC-10 Operations Procedures, and this volume.
     1.1.3. Compliance. The Chief of Wing Intel will ensure compliance with AF and MAJCOM
     directives and procedures as well as special notices in the Intelligence Read File.
1.2. Waivers. AMC/A2 will notify AF/A2DF of significant trends in waiver correspondence if
such correspondence indicates the need to readdress existing policy and guidance.

unit personnel require external training and will modify training requirements as appropriate.
3.2. External Intelligence Training Program Management.
     3.2.1. Only qualified external intelligence trainers will conduct unsupervised EIT events.
     EIT specialized training requirements and evaluation criteria are identified in AFI 14-2KC-

        3.2.2.1. Appoint in writing an EIT program manager to oversee program execution.
        Advanced Air Mobility Intelligence Course (AAMIC) graduates and Force Protection
        Intelligence Formal Training Unit (IFTU) graduates should be considered for
        appointment as EIT program manager. (T-3)
        3.2.2.2. . Coordinate detailed program guidance with all applicable commanders of any
        unit for which intelligence training is provided on a regularly scheduled basis. (T-3)
     3.2.3. The EIT Program Manager will:
        3.2.3.1. Establish an EIT program tailored to the unit’s mission, weapons systems,
        projected wartime/Air Expeditionary Force tasking, deployment and forward operating
        location(s). Include input from operational squadrons, tactics representative, aircrew
        flight equipment (AFE) personnel, Security Forces (SF) personnel, Air Force Office of

        specialists, as appropriate. (T-2)
        3.2.3.2. Develop written guidance on procedures for conducting, documenting, testing,
        evaluating, monitoring and reporting EIT. (T-3)
            3.2.3.2.1. List specific training objectives for each major area of intelligence training
            and the training method and resources used to satisfy the objective. Training methods
            may include, but are not limited to: briefings, demonstration-performance, formal
            and informal lectures. Training resources may include, but are not limited to: threat-
            of-the day briefings, current intelligence briefings, academic training sessions, theater
            orientation briefings and weapons system videos.
            3.2.3.2.2. Coordinate this guidance with any agency (e.g. Tactics, SERE, AFE) that
            assists intelligence personnel in providing training.
        3.2.3.3. Review training objectives for currency prior to the beginning of the training
        cycle. (T-3)
        3.2.3.4. Actively solicit feedback to ensure training objectives are meeting training
        requirements. (T-3)
        3.2.3.5. Analyze trends following each training cycle and apply lessons learned, as
        applicable. (T-3)
AFI14-2KC-10V3 7 March 2013                                                                      9


       3.2.3.6. Provide a written evaluation of the wing/group EIT program to the appropriate
       commander at the end of each training cycle. The evaluation will include as a minimum:
       the percent or number of personnel trained; trend analysis (high miss questions, weak
       areas, etc.); and corrective actions taken. See Attachment 5 for an EIT Report example.
       (T-3)
3.3. Aircrew Intelligence Training. AIT will be coordinated with the wing or group Tactics
Flight or Officer. Integrate intelligence training of threats and adversary tactics and techniques
with aircrew KC-10 tactics and countertactics training. The AIT program will cover, at a
minimum, these topics on an annual basis: (T-2)
   3.3.1. Threat Knowledge.
       3.3.1.1. Concentrate on threats in selected countries with the potential for direct unit
       involvement. Include examples of weapons employment tactics (e.g., enemy use of
       barrage fire, 4-ship flight formations, etc.).
       3.3.1.2. Provide inputs to the lead MAJCOM-developed master question file (MQF).
       3.3.1.3. Ensure AFTTP 3-1.Threat Guide is the primary reference for threat knowledge
       training and ensure training is current with the latest edition. Ensure AFTTP 3-1.KC-10
       is the primary reference for KC-10 tactics and ensure training is current with the latest
       edition. References may be supplemented with other classified and unclassified
       publications such as Tactics Bulletins, Tactics Analysis Reports, Country Studies, etc.
   3.3.2. Visual Recognition (VR).
       3.3.2.1. Ensure VR training includes airframes likely to be encountered in the unit-tasked
       Area of Responsibility (AOR) including rotary and fixed-wing, as well as joint/allied
       assets. Training also should cover major categories of ground equipment and naval
       vessels.
       3.3.2.2. Training should incorporate all aspects/angles, theater specific paint schemes, fin
