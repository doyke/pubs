MEMORANDUM FOR ALL MAJCOM SG
FROM: HQ USAF/SG3
      1780 Air Force Pentagon
      Washington, DC 20330-1780
SUBJECT: Guidance Memorandum – AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards
         By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Guidance Memorandum immediately
implements changes to AFI 48-123 to include updating the medical examinations for separation
or retirement as required by Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 14-006, Separation History
and Physical Examination (SHPE). In addition, changes have been made related to Flying Class
(FC) III medical classification, medical certification for hypobaric training, medical certification
for hyperbaric duties, and clarification which duties personnel in AFSC 1C5 are allowed to
perform when medically restricted from controlling duties. Compliance with this memorandum
is mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the
information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
Management.
        The updated Separation Health and Physical Examination must not be initiated until 01
November 2014 unless approved by AFMSA/SG3PF. Medical Treatment Facilities must be in
full compliance no later than 31 December 2014.
      This memorandum becomes void after one-year has elapsed from the date of this
memorandum, or upon publication of an Interim Change or rewrite of the affected publication,
whichever is earlier.

(Add) Opening Paragraph. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this
publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance
statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, for a description of the
authorities associated with the Tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the chain of
command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication
OPR for non-tiered compliance items.

(Add) 1.1.2. The Medical Standards Directory is located at
https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx4/FlightMedicine/Documents/Forms/ShowFolders.aspx?RootFolder=
%2fkj%2fkx4%2fFlightMedicine%2fDocuments%2fMedical%20Standards%20Directory%20%
28MSD%29&FolderCTID=0x0120004DEB19A0C597EF4794DF99094B5AD8FC.

(Add) 1.1.2.1. The Medical Standards Directory and the Official Air Force Medicine Approved
Medications must be used IAW AFI 48-123 and can be changed through the process noted in
AFI 48-123 GM paragraph 1.1.2.2.

(Add) 1.1.2.2. Medical standards and aircrew approved medications are changed through a
process that includes review by the Aircrew Medical Standards Working Group (ASWG) which
includes members from MAJCOMs, HAF/A3, and appropriate Subject Matter Experts for the
specific standards. Then any recommended changes by the ASWG are reviewed by the Flight
and Operational Medicine Corporate Board whose voting members include the
MAJCOM/SGPs. All medical standards are approved IAW the AF/SG’s delegated authority.
For retention standards the delefated authority is the AF/SG3 and for all special duty medical
standards (including flying) the delegted authority is the AF/SG3P.

(Add) 1.1.2.3. The Chief of Physical Standards Development is the OPR for any changes and
can be contacted for any recommendations.

(Replace) 1.2.4.5. Color Vision Testing: Pseudoisochromatic Plate (PIP) testing to determine
color vision perception which will be completed at accession or when cross training to a non-
flying/SOD position; results are recorded in their record (T-2). (SOD positions include but are
not limited to GBC, SERE, PJ and Combat Control.) If an applicant wants to apply for flying or
special duty, then they must pass the Cone Contrast Test (CCT) at an AF MTF or equivalent. (T-
1) Exception: See section 3.1.3 for applicants for Initial Flying Class I and IFCII/FS and
Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) duties.

(Add) 2.7.5.2. Retraining applications will be reviewed by the primary care provider at the
request of the MSME. (T-1) The provider will then update the PULHES (see attachment 3) for
the applicant in an AF Form 422 IAW AFI 10-203. (T-2)

(Add) 2.9.5. Retraining applications will be reviewed by the MSME to ensure members are

qualified for entry into the AFSC(s) for which the member is applying IAW AFI 10-203. (T-1)
MSME will ensure PULHES (see attachment 3) is updated IAW AFI 10-203. (T-1)

(Replace) 6.1.1.5. Flying Class (FC) III qualifies individuals for aviation as indicated in the Air
Force Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD), and the Air Force Enlisted Classification
Directory (AFECD). For USAFA cadets participating in USAFA cadet airmanship program, see
AFI 48-123 paragraph 6.24.6. A Categorical FCIII qualifies individuals for duty with certain
restrictions. Granting categorical certifications and waivers does not guarantee operational
utilization. Restrictions for FCIIIC and FCIIID will be documented in the remarks section of the
AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent. (T-1) See AFI 48-123 paragraph 6.4. for certification and
waiver authority.

(Add) 6.1.1.5.1. FCIIIC qualifies individuals for aviation duty as specified in the remarks
section of AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent. Example: Restricted to current and previously
qualified systems. If using new systems requiring interpretation of different color symbology, an

per the CFM, as documented in the AFOCD or AFECD.

(Change) 6.4.1.1. All initial and renewal categorical flying waivers; changes from one category
to another; removal of a categorical restriction. Exceptions are for specific cases where
AFMSA/SG3PF delegates to MAJCOM or in an official delegation letter from AFMSA/SG3PF
(maintained on the KX). These cannot be further delegated to the base level.

(Add) 6.4.1.9.1. AFMSA/SG3PF delegates to AETC/SGPS authority for initial FCIIID
certification for untrained personnel who do not require depth perception as stated in the AFOCD
or AFECD. See AFI 48-123 GM paragraph 6.1.1.5.2.

(Add) 6.4.1.9.2. AFMSA/SG3PF delegates to MAJCOM waiver authority for FCIIID waivers in
trained personnel who do not require depth perception as stated in the AFOCD or AFECD. See
AFI 49-123 GM paragraph 6.1.1.5.2.

(Add) 6.5.1. When flyer/SOD is in DNIF/C/A status, there may be other duties that can be
performed.

6.5.1.1. Clearance for SIM training and/or other duties may be annotated on the AF Form 1042
or Joint equivalent.

6.5.1.2. When a 1C5X1 is DNIC, a FS may decide they can perform all 1C5X1 duties except
1C5X1D (Weapons Director). In this instance, the FS would ensure a statement is placed on the



3
AF Form 1042; “DNIC, may perform 1C5X1 duties with the exception of 1C5X1D specific
duties.”

(Replace) 6.21. Medical Standards. For accessions and enlistments the standards in Chapter 4
apply. Chapter 5 and the Medical Standards Directory apply to personnel already serving as AD
or ARC (example, AD SSgt applying for IFCI duty must meet retention standards in Chapter 5,
as well as IFCI standards in the Medical Standards Directory). For conditions listed in Chapter 5
and the Medical Standards Directory, ensure an I/RILO or MEB/FFD has been initiated if
appropriate. The medical standards for SOD exams are based on AFSC, FC and special duties;
for medical standards reference the requirements in the AFOCD, AFECD, this section, 6H, 6I,
6J, and the MSD paying special attention to the notes at the top of each subheading.

(Add) 6.24.3.3.6. Physiologic training participants without an AF Form 1042 and the above
completed, will complete a medical history and examination based upon AFI 48-123 paragraph
6.24.2 OSF Duty.

(Add) 6.24.8. Hyperbaric Duty.

(Add) 6.24.8.1. The conditions listed in Chapter 5 and the Operational Support Flyer column of
the Medical Standards Directory are disqualifying for personnel conducting hyperbaric duties
within the chamber.

(Add) 6.24.8.2. Personnel who perform hyperbaric duties are required to have a normal
examination of tympanic membranes, lungs and chest, heart, abdomen, neurologic, weight, blood
pressure and pulse documented in their health record for an initial examination. The exam’s
expiration date is the PHA expiration date. Note: AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent is issued as
satisfactory evidence of completion of the requirements outlined for training and duty. This
examination does not need to be entered into PEPP.

(Add) 6.24.3.3.6. Physiologic training participants without a AF Form 1042 and the above
completed, will complete a medical history and examination based upon AFI 48-123 paragraph
6.24.2 OSF Duty.

(Replace) 6.24.7.1. Pilots of fighter, rotary wing, fixed wing (non-fighter) aircraft transferring
from sister service to an equivalent weapon system in the Air Force are considered trained assets.
Air Force FCII standards apply. Complete all requirements for pilot’s age IAW PHA and
ASIMS guidelines. This FCII physical will be entered into PEPP for baseline comparison and
into AIMWTS if flying waiver required.

(Add) 6.24.7.2. Pilots of fighter, rotary wing, and fixed wing (non-fighter) transferring to AF
from a different type of weapon system are not considered trained assets. Flying Class I




4
standards apply. These pilots would require initial FCI physical and successful completion of
MFS. This FCI physical will be entered into PEPP and into AIMWTS if flying waiver required.

(Add) 6.24.8. Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operators. Must meet standards for
continued military service (Retention) and Section U: SUAS Standards as listed in the Medical
Standards Directory. (T-1)

(Replace entire Chapter 7)
                                           CHAPTER 7
          MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS FOR SEPARATION AND RETIREMENT
7.1. Policy. This is the AF policy implementing the DoD Separation History and Physical
Examination (SHPE) IAW Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 14-006, “Separation History
and Physical Examination (SHPE)”. Do not delay separation or retirement past scheduled date
of separation or retirement to complete a medical examination unless medical hold is approved
(see AFI 41-210 for further guidance on medical hold authority and related topics).
7.2. Purpose. To identify medical conditions requiring attention, to document current medical
status, and potentially assist with the evaluation of disability claims.
7.3. Presumption of Fitness. Except for Service members previously determined unfit and
continued in a permanent limited duty status, Service members who have been referred for a
SHPE because of retirement or separation are presumed fit for retention. Service members will
therefore only be referred to the Disability Evaluation System or Integrated Disability Evaluation
System (IDES) if a condition that would prevent the member from performing further duty if he
or she were not separating or retiring is detected at the time of the SHPE and the referral is in
accordance with DoD Instruction 1332.38 (Reference (h)).
7.4. Law Governing Disability Evaluation.
7.4.1. Title 10, United States Code, Chapter 58, outlines benefits and service for members being
separated from the armed forces.
7.4.2. Title 38, United States Code, administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs governs
disability compensation for ratable service-connected defects.
7.4.3. Title 10 United States Code Section 1145 directs conduct of separation examinations on
specific individuals leaving the armed forces.
7.5. Mandatory SHPE
7.5.1. All members of the Military Services, to include Reserve Component (RC) service
members, who are scheduled to be separated (deactivated) from active duty after serving for 180
days consecutively or more, will undergo a comprehensive SHPE prior to the scheduled date of
separation (deactivation). (T-0, DTM 14-006) RC service members serving on active duty for a
period of more than 30 days in support of a contingency operation, will also undergo a SHPE
prior to the date of separation (demobilization) from AD service IAW with DTM 14-006. (T-0,
DTM 14-006)
    7.5.1.1. RC service members serving on active duty for less than 180 days or on active duty
    for training, other training duty, not annual training as defined in DoDI 1215.06 or other non-
    mobilization orders are not required to undergo a SHPE, but will document their current
    health status and complete DD Form 2697, “Report of Health Assessment,” before
    completing their scheduled tour of duty.
    7.5.1.2. Except for service members previously determined unfit and continued in a
    permanent limited duty status, service members who have been referred for a SHPE because
    of retirement or separation are presumed fit for retention. SMs will therefore only be referred



6
    to the Disability Evaluation System or Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) if a
    condition that would prevent the member from performing further duty if he or she were not
    separating or retiring is detected at the time of the SHPE and the referral is in accordance with
    DoD Instruction 1332.38 and AFMOA SHPE Guide.
    7.5.1.3. SHPE requirements under this AFI are in addition to any deployment health activities
    specified in DoD Instruction 6490.03, Deployment Health, and AFI 48-122, Deployment
    Health.
    7.5.1.4. Active or RC service members who intend to remain in the Selected Reserve upon
    separation from Active Duty and who elect to file a pre-separation disability claim with the
    VA must complete SHPE through the Military Health System or the schedule through the VA
    before separation. (T-3)
7.5.2. The SHPE examination will be completed by the DoD if the service member does not
wish to file a disability claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) prior to the
member’s separation or retirement. (T-0, DTM 14-006)
    7.5.2.1. The PCM Team or Primary Care Clinic assigned will complete their empanelled
    members’ SHPE requirements unless a MTF supplement is approved by AFI 48-123 OPR or
    waiver provided by AFMSA/SG3PF (see AFMOA SHPE Guide).
    7.5.2.2. If not completed by the VA, ARC service members should complete the mandated
    SHPE as directed by the MTF or as directed by AFMOA Guidance. Travel costs will be
    included as applicable. (See AFMOA SHPE Guide.)
    7.5.2.3. Navy and Army RC service members should complete their examinations through
    their mobilization/demobilization facilities or or other locations directed by their service.
7.5.3. Timing of SHPE. Refer to DTM and subsequent DoDI for the timing of the SHPE.
Please review to the AFMOA SHPE User Guide for guidance on how to execute the
requirements.
7.5.4. DoD SHPE Components, per DTM 14-006, complete, at a minimum.
    7.5.4.1. DD Form 2807-1, Report of Medical History, completed by service member and
    signed by a licensed, privileged healthcare provider. (T-0, DTM 14-006)
       7.5.4.1.1. The DD Form 2807-1 completed by the service member is available for the
       privileged provider performing the physical examination at the time of the encounter.
       7.5.4.1.2. A face-to-face interview with a licensed, privileged healthcare provider to
       discuss care and services for medical concerns subsequent to their completion of the self-
       reported health assessment is conducted with the service members.
       7.5.4.1.3. The privileged health care provider reviews the service member’s complete
       medical history; current worldwide medical qualification status; the member’s current
       health status; and need for referral for treatment or further evaluations for medical
       concerns.
       7.5.4.1.4. All positive responses on the DD Form 2807-1 are addressed by the privileged
       provider performing the SHPE.



7
    7.5.4.2. DD Form 2808, Report of Medical Examination, as noted below, completed by a
    privileged provider. This includes a review of medical record and a record of significant
    medical conditions. (T-0, DTM 14-006)
       7.5.4.2.1. Blocks, 1-44, 53,54,57, 58, 77, and 85.
       7.5.4.2.2. Block 71 unless the threshold audiogram is contained in the Service Treatment
       Record (STR). See 7.5.4.3.
    7.5.4.3. Threshold audiogram documented on DD Form 2808 threshold unless a recent
    audiogram (within 6 months of the SHPE) is documented in the STR. (T-0, DTM 14-006)
    Note: Unless the SM is a member of the Hearing Conservation Program, an AF Form 1753,
    Hearing Conservation Examination, is NOT required.
    7.5.4.4. Complete audiology evaluation if the threshold audiogram is abnormal. (T-0, DTM
    14-006)
    7.5.4.5. Optional Hepatitis C testing per CDC guidelines. (T-0, DTM 14-006)
    7.5.4.6. Additional testing appropriate to the service member’s health status, as determined
    by the examining licensed provider and in accordance with current DoD policy.
    7.5.4.7. Verification that all occupational health examinations required by DoD policy (e.g.,
    hearing conservation, radiation medical surveillance) have been completed before the SHPE
    is conducted.
    7.5.4.8. Other Tests. Any periodic testing required by other issuances (e.g., HIV testing in
    accordance with DoD Instruction 6485.01 (Reference (j))) must be completed before referral
    for SHPE.
    7.5.4.9. Any examination completed on DD Forms 2807-1 and 2808, threshold audiogram,
    laboratory testing, or other exams performed for any other reason that meets any of the
    requirements stated in paragraphs 7.5.4.1. and 7.5.4.2. within the time periods stated in
    paragraph 7.5.3. of this attachment, is sufficient to meet this requirement, but only with the
    consent of the Service member and concurrence of the member’s unit commander. If another
    examination documented on a DD Form 2807-1 and DD Form 2808 performed within the
    previous 12 months is used to meet this requirement, and more than 60 days have elapsed
    since the date of the qualifying examination, the Service member must complete a standard
    DD Form 2697. (T-0, DTM 14-006)
    7.5.4.10. When the SHPE is completed by the DoD, the following documentation is
    required, at a minimum:
       7.5.4.10.1. A medical encounter note must be included in the service treatment record
       when completed by DoD. (T-0, DTM 14-006) The note must include the DD Form 2807-1
       in HAIMS, and either the Form DD Form 2808 in HAIMS or a medical record template
       may be used in lieu of completing a separate form if it includes all the essential elements of
       the DD Form 2808. (T-1)
       7.5.4.10.2. The encounter note must include the accepted diagnosis code for a Separation
       History and Physical (V70.5_9) for the first diagnosis. (T-1)




8
      7.5.4.10.3. The summary list of diagnoses from the DD Form 2808 should all be included

            Information Management Waiver Tracking System (AIMWTS) are not utilized or
            available. (T-1) Note: All induction physical examinations accomplished overseas
            by a medical treatment facility must be submitted through PEPP to AETC/SGPS. (T-
            1) AETC/SGPS is the certifying authority for all accession physicals not done at a
            MEPS facility. ARC/SG is the reviewing and certification authority for all ARC
            enlistment and commissioning exams.
        1.2.1.3. Termination of service when specified by Chapter 7 of this instruction.
        1.2.1.4. As required by AFI 44-170.
        1.2.1.5. As required for General Officer Boards.
        1.2.1.6. Enlisted members applying for commissioning may use their most current PHA
        and completed AF Form 422, Notification of Air Force Member’s Qualification Status,
        noting qualified for General Military Service (GMS), Commission and Retention without
        a deployment limitation, in lieu of accomplishing another physical for the specific
        purpose of commissioning.
     1.2.2. Examiners: All personnel prior to entrance into the military service will have an
     examination completed by either DoDMERB contracted personnel or MEPS. For all other
     examinations, the following personnel can complete the required examination.
        1.2.2.1. A credentialed physician employed by the armed services, regardless of AD
        status, to include TRICARE providers and United States Coast Guard (USCG)
        credentialed providers, as well as designated Air Force physician assistants, (Air Force
        Specialty Code (AFSC) 42G4X) or primary care nurse practitioners (AFSC 46NXC),
        under the supervision of, and subject to review by a physician, may accomplish non-
        flying medical examinations.
        1.2.2.2. A credentialed military or USCG flight surgeon (FS) with current/active
        privileges in flight/aerospace medicine will perform medical examinations on Air Force
        flying and/or SOD personnel. (T-1)
            1.2.2.2.1. When the exam is accomplished by a non-Air Force FS at a location where
            no AF FS is available, forward the documents (including PHA and clinical
            documentation, labs, AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special
            Operational Duty, or DoD equivalent, AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition
            Report, etc.) to the examinee’s servicing military treatment facility (MTF) for review
AFI48-123 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   9


        and MAJCOM/SG for review and certification. This includes aircrew on joint/ North
        Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) tours, etc.
        1.2.2.2.2. When the exam is accomplished by a non-AF FS at a joint base or AF
        MTF, the AF FS must ensure sister-service FS is trained in AF standards and
        associated paperwork. Training will be determined by the SGP and documented in
        the Provider Activity Folder. If trained, sister-service FS can sign AF Form 1042 or
        DoD equivalent without an AF FS review. Quality control will be assessed via FS
        peer review IAW AFI 44-119, Medical Quality Operations. If untrained, an AF FS
        must review all PHA and return to flying status (RTFS) documentation for AF
        aircrew. All aircrew and SOD members examined by a US military FS (to include
        USCG FS) and found qualified to perform flight or SOD will be returned to
        flying/SOD status upon completion of their examination.
        1.2.2.2.3. Military flight surgeons must be credentialed and privileged in
        flight/aerospace medicine at the examining facility and can be of any branch of the
        military service or Coast Guard. All may make aeromedical dispositions (RTFS) if
        credentialed as noted.
        1.2.2.2.4. Physicians who are Air Force civilian employees or contractors may
        perform medical examinations on AF flying and/or SOD personnel and be
        credentialed to make aeromedical dispositions only if they meet the qualification
        criteria listed in the Civilian Flight Medicine Physician Performance Work Statement
        located at https://kx.afms.mil/kxweb/dotmil/file/web/ctb_207539.pdf and approved
        by Air Force Medical Operations Agency (AFMOA)/SGPF.
     1.2.2.3. NGB/SG may delegate review and certification authority to current, trained and
     designated State Air Surgeon (SAS) on certain initial Flying Class (FC) III and return to
     FCIII examinations, Commission/Enlistment physicals not requiring MAJCOM level
     waiver and on Active Guard Reserve (AGR) Title 32 physicals. Note: Consult current
     Tri-Service agreements and MAJCOM/SG prior to forwarding examinations.
        1.2.2.3.1. State Air Surgeon that are current, certified, and trained as specifically
        identified by NGB/SG retain this authority. This authority will not be delegated
        further. At locations where SAS are not assigned, or are not trained, the
        certification/waiver authority reverts to NGB/SG.
  1.2.3. Locations. Physical examinations are normally accomplished at the following
  locations:
     1.2.3.1. Medical facilities of the uniformed services, including TRICARE facilities and
     Reserve Health Readiness Program (RHRP) () providers away from an MTF.
     1.2.3.2. MEPS.
     1.2.3.3. DODMERB contract sites.
     1.2.3.4. Where no AF or DoD MTF exists, TRICARE Service agreement providers may
     accomplish examinations. This may include credentialed providers for military attaché
     and embassy members.
     1.2.3.5. Air Force Medical Support Agency (AFMSA) AFMSA/SG3PF must authorize
     exceptions to the above. Exceptions to the above for Temporary Disability Retirement

     care in DoD facilities unless they are an authorized beneficiary.
        1.2.3.6.1. If additional testing is required to determine accession eligibility for non-
        beneficiaries and if the services are available, the Air Force may authorize testing to
        be accomplished at MTFs or other government agencies.
        1.2.3.6.2. In the event a diagnosis or potential diagnosis of disease is noted during an
        examination, the examining provider will counsel the applicant and effect transfer of
        care to the member’s private physician. (T-0) Treatment is not authorized for non-
        beneficiary applicants; however, every effort to secure positive transfer of care is
        mandatory in this instance. (T-0)

   1.3.2. Interval Medical History. Once a complete medical history has been recorded on a
   SF 93 or DD Form 2807-1, only significant items of medical history since the last medical
   examination are recorded. This is called the interval medical history. Reference each update
   to the medical history with the current date, followed by any significant items of medical
   history since last examination. ANG will use AF WEB HA for interval history.
       1.3.2.1. Changes in Flight Status. Any significant medical condition requiring
       hospitalization, excusal, grounding for greater than 30 cumulative days for same or
       similar conditions, profile change or suspension from flying status is recorded as part of
       the interval medical history. The information concerning the interval medical history is
       obtained by questioning the examinee and by a thorough review of the examinee’s health
       records.
       1.3.2.2. Significant Medical History. Use SF 93/DD Form 2807-1, waiver requests,
       Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) diagnosis, or restricted duty for 30 days or more as a
       guide in determining items to include as significant medical history. Do not record
       "routine" items such as URIs, viral illnesses, etc., unless hospitalization was required or
       the illness is of a frequent or chronic nature.
       1.3.2.3. Denial Statement. After recording the interval medical history, the following
       denial statement is recorded: "No other significant medical or surgical history to report
       since last examination (enter the date of that examination in parentheses)."
       1.3.2.4. No Interval Medical History Statement. If the examinee had no interval medical
       history, record the current date followed by the statement: "Examinee denies and review
       of outpatient medical record fails to reveal any significant interval medical or surgical
       history to report since last examination dated (enter the date of that examination in
       parentheses)." See physical examination techniques for denial statement used when
       accomplishing the DD Form 2807-1.
       1.3.2.5. Additional Space. Use SF 507, Clinical Record-Continuation Sheet as an
       attachment to the Report of Medical History when additional space is required (See
       Physical Examinations Techniques).
1.4. Medical Examinations. The results of medical examinations are recorded on DD Form
2808 or approved substitutes in accordance with physical examination techniques.
1.5. Adaptability Rating. Adaptability Rating for Military Aviation (ARMA) and other
military duties, such as for Marine Diving Duty (MDD), Ground Based Controller (GBC), RPA
or Missile Operations Duty (MOD) etc., is the responsibility of the examining flight surgeon, as
is the scope and extent of the interview. Initial (entry into training) unsatisfactory adaptability
ratings are usually rendered for poor motivation for aerial or SOD adaptability, or evidence of a
AFI48-123 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   13


potential safety of flight risk, etc. (see Medical Standards Directory and Physical Examination
Techniques.
1.6. DD Form 2766, Adult Preventive and Chronic Care Flowsheet. DD Form 2766 is used to
record results of tests such as blood type, G6PD, DNA, Flyer/SOD ground testing, flying/SOD
waiver information, etc., and also may be used as a deployment document IAW AFI 10-403,

  Aircraft Training (URT) training. Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) refers to applicants
  for pilot (manned). Examination (Flying Classes I and IA) must be current within 48 months
  prior to starting UPT/UNT. Examination (Flying Classes II) must be current within 48
  months prior to starting URT. The 48 month period begins from date of certification/waiver
  of the physical examination (e.g. AETC/SGPS certifies examination on 1 Jan 2008. The 48
  month period expires 1 Jan 2012.). Medical history (DD Form 2807-1) must be verified as
  current within 12 months prior to start of training. Service member must have a current PHA
  in addition to certified IFCI/IA. An initial certification examination does not exempt service
  applicants from accomplishing their required PHA while awaiting training. Note: If a
  member has an IFCI/IA examination and later applies for a flying or SOD duty that does not
  have to meet IFCI/IA standards, the IFCI/IA examination is valid for four years and no
  supplement is needed.

     standards but do not require repeat MFS-N screening.
     3.1.3.2. All initial applications for UPT must pass MFS prior to beginning UPT.
     3.1.3.3. All initial applications for URT must pass MFS-N prior to beginning URT.
     MFS for RPA pilot applicants will be limited to conditions requiring further evaluation
     (MFS-N is mandatory and may include enhanced MFS-N screening if appropriate).
     3.1.3.4. Pilot and Navigator candidates must have a current, certified Flying Class I/IA
     examination, respectively, on record. AETC/SGPS will retain waiver authority for
     UPT/UNT students from successful completion of an IFC physical and MFS, until they
     graduate from UPT and are awarded a pilot AFSC. Note: While attending UPT/UNT
     training FCI/IA standards (as appropriate) apply. Upon UPT graduation FCII standards
     apply.
     3.1.3.5. Flight surgeon and URT applicants must have a current, certified IFCII
     examination on record and be qualified for FCII duties while attending training and upon
     graduation.

     3.1.3.6. The member’s PHA should be current prior to beginning active UPT/URT. If a
     member was not on AD (e.g. AFROTC/OTS candidates) prior to arrival at UPT/URT or
     is otherwise not PHA current, then member will have PHA accomplished during in-
     processing at the UPT/URT base. PHA currency must be maintained throughout
     UPT/URT. See AFI 44-170 for additional details.
  3.1.4. Continued Flying. Flying and Special Duty Operations personnel will follow
  existing guidance in AFI 44-170. Required examinations for these personnel are in sync with
  current PHA and IMR reporting business rules. The initial flying/SOD physical may also
  count as the commissioning physical as long as all requirements of the commissioning
  physical are met.
  3.1.5. Inactive Flyers. Inactive flyers that do not receive aviation pay IAW AFI 11-402,
  Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Aviation Badges are not required
  to maintain Flying Class II standards as outlined in Chapter 6, and the Medical Standards
  Directory. Inactive Career Enlisted Aviators and Special Operator Duty (SOD) personnel
  that do not receive aviation pay IAW AFI 11-402 are not required to maintain their
  appropriate standards as outlined in Chapter 6, Medical Standards Directory. A flight
  surgeon may complete aeromedical waivers for inactive flyers or SOD if member intends to

                   APPOINTMENT, ENLISTMENT, AND INDUCTION

Section 4A—Medical Standards for Appointment, Enlistment, and Induction

4.1. References. DoDI 6130.03, Medical Standards for Appointment, Enlistment or Induction
in the Military Services, http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/613003p.pdf,
establishes basic medical standards for enlistment, appointment, and induction into the Armed
Forces of the United States according to the authority contained in Title 10, United States Code,
Section 113. DoDI 6130.03. sets forth the medical conditions and physical defects that are
causes for rejection for military service. These standards are not all inclusive and other diseases
or defects can be cause for rejection based upon the medical judgment of the examining
healthcare provider.
   4.1.1. Personnel rejected for military service for any medical condition or physical defect
   listed in DoDI 6130.03 may be reviewed if the condition has resolved and a history of the
   condition is not disqualifying IAW this AFI.
   4.1.2. DoDI 6130.03. directs utilization of the International Classification of Disease (ICD)
   in all records pertaining to a medical condition that results in a personnel action, such as
   separation or medical waiver. In addition, when a medical condition standard is waived or
   results in a separation, written clarification of the personnel action must be provided using
   standard medical terminology.
   4.1.3. In accordance with DODI 1308.03, DoD Physical Fitness and Body Fat Programs
   Procedures, weight and height remain part of accession physical standards. See Chapter 6,
   and the Medical Standards Directory for additional requirements for flying applicants.
4.2. Applicability. These standards apply to:
   4.2.1. Applicants for appointment as commissioned officers in the Active and Reserve
   components who have not held a prior commission for at least 6 months or it has been more
   than 6 months since separation.
   4.2.2. Applicants for enlistment in the regular Air Force. Includes medical conditions or
   physical defects predating original enlistment, for the first six months of AD in the regular
   Air Force.
   4.2.3. Applicants for enlistment in the Reserve or Air National Guard. For medical
   conditions or physical defects predating original enlistment (existing prior to service
   (EPTS)), these standards apply during the enlistee’s initial period of AD for training until
   their return to their Reserve Component Units.
   4.2.4. Applicants for reenlistment in Regular Air Force and ARC after a period of more than
   6 months have elapsed since separation.
   4.2.5. Applicants for the Scholarship or Advanced Course ROTC, and all other Armed
   Forces special officer personnel procurement programs.
   4.2.6. Retention of cadets at the United States Air Force Academy and students enrolled in
   the ROTC scholarship programs.
AFI48-123 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                     23


  4.2.7. AFROTC graduates whose AD is delayed under applicable directives.
  4.2.8. All individuals being inducted into the Armed Forces.
  4.2.9. Individuals on TDRL who have been found fit upon reevaluation and wish to return to
  AD. The prior disabling defect or defects, and any other physical defects identified before
  placement on the TDRL that would not have prevented reenlistment, are exempt from this
  directive. Note: Individuals on TDRL are considered “retired” and thus have left AD, (most
  likely for a period of at least 6 months before their first re-examination as a TDRL designated
  member), and therefore, fall under accession standards prior to re-entering military service.

           CONTINUED MILITARY SERVICE (RETENTION STANDARDS)

Section 5A—Medical Evaluation

5.1. Medical Evaluation for Continued Military Service (Retention Standards). This
chapter and the Medical Standards Directory include medical conditions and defects that are
potentially disqualifying and/or preclude continued military service. These standards are not all
inclusive and other diseases or defects can be cause for rejection based upon the medical
judgment of the examining healthcare provider. Airmen with conditions listed in this chapter
and the Medical Standards Directory require evaluation for continued military service (See
paragraph 5.3). Other physical and mental conditions that render an individual unsuited for duty
or otherwise interfere with military service do not constitute a physical disability. These
conditions are not eligible for DES processing. See AFI 36-3208, para 5.11 and AFI 36-3212 for
further instructions.
   5.1.1. For AD. Potentially disqualifying medical conditions and defects are reviewed by the
   Deployment Availability Working Group (DAWG) IAW AFI 10-203 and AFI 41-210.
   5.1.2. For ARC. Potentially disqualifying defects must first be determined if the condition
   is in the Line of Duty IAW AFI 36-2910, Line of Duty (Misconduct) Determination. If
   defects are found to be In Line of Duty, processing occurs through the AD process in
   paragraph 5.1.1 of this AFI. Potentially disqualifying defects that are not In Line of Duty
   require a fitness for duty evaluation and must be accomplished through the respective
   ARC/SG. All medical conditions and defects are reviewed by the Deployment Availability
   Working Group (DAWG), IAW AFI 10-203.
5.2. Applicability. The retention standards apply to:
   5.2.1. Regular Air Force members on AD, unless excluded from DES by applicable
   directives (e.g. Punitive actions).
       5.2.1.1. USAFA Cadets’ retention standards for continued training at the Academy are
       the accession medical standards IAW DoDI 6130.03. If a USAFA Cadet has their
       accession medical standard waived, retention medical standards apply for that condition
       IAW 48-123 Chapter 5 and the Medical Standards Directory. If the Cadet does not meet
       accession standards and they are not waived, then Cadet is subject to DES processing in
       accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 1217 and AFI 36-3212.
   5.2.2. All individuals who have separated or retired from AD with any of the regular Armed
   Services, but who are reenlisting in the regular Air Force or ARC when no more than 6
   months have elapsed between separation and reenlistment. If more than 6 months have
   elapsed Chapter 4 applies.
   5.2.3. ARC and retired regular members if mobilized or otherwise recalled to AD.
   5.2.4. ARC members who are:
       5.2.4.1. On EAD unless excluded from disability evaluation by applicable directives.
AFI48-123 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                        25


       5.2.4.2. Ordered to EAD with the regular Air Force and who are eligible for fitness for
       duty evaluation under applicable directives.
       5.2.4.3. Reenlisting in the regular Air Force when no more than 6 months have elapsed
       between release from EAD with any regular Armed Service and reenlistment or entry. If
       more than 6 months have elapsed Chapter 4 applies.
       5.2.4.4. Not on EAD but eligible for MEB under applicable directives.
       5.2.4.5. AFRC members entering AGR tours. ANG members entering EAD statutory
       tours (Title 10) or AGR tours (Title 32).
   5.2.5. Air Reserve Components. The appropriate ARC/SG IAW Attachment 2 uses the
   standards in Chapter 5, Medical Standards Directory, and the list of allowable prescribed
   medications to determine:
       5.2.5.1. The medical qualification for continued military duty in the ARC for members
       not on EAD and not eligible for disability processing.
       5.2.5.2. The medical qualification of officers and enlisted members from any service
       component requesting entrance into USAFR and ANG.
           5.2.5.2.1. The medical qualification of officers and enlisted members from any
           service component requesting entrance into the ANG provided no more than 6
           months have elapsed between separation from the service component and entry into
           the ANG.
           5.2.5.2.2. If more than 6 months (from date of separation) have elapsed, applicants
           must meet the standards of Chapter 4

Section 5B—Medical Standards for Continued Military Service (Retention Standards)

5.3. Standards. While this is not an all-inclusive list of disqualifying conditions, conditions and
defects listed in Chapter 5 and the Medical Standards Directory are potentially disqualifying
and/or preclude continued military service. The standards and other diseases or defects not
specifically listed can be cause for rejection based upon the medical judgment of the examining
physician or reviewing authority. Retention standards also require members to be fit for mobility
status IAW Chapter 11. For AD Airmen and ARC Airmen with duty-related (line-of-duty-yes
conditions), refer members with disqualifying conditions to the DAWG. For I/RILO and MEB
processing, see AFI 41-210 and 5.3.2 For ARC members with non-duty-related (line-of-duty-
no) refer members with disqualifying conditions to the DAWG for Fitness for Duty evaluation,
see Chapter 10. For Airmen returning to AD who do not meet retention standards but are
eligible for an assignment limitation code, AETC/SG will coordinate with AFPC/DPANM
through evaluation for Assignment Limitation Code C (ALC-C) for potential assignment
restrictions. While elective surgery by itself is not necessarily disqualifying, intentional effects
and unintended complications from elective surgery may render an individual unfit for WWD.
For elective surgery information, refer to AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management. In addition,
non-emergent elective surgeries within 6 months of separation or retirement must have additional
prior approval by HQ AFPC/DPAMM, as required IAW AFI 41-210.
   5.3.1. General and Miscellaneous Conditions and Defects.
26                                                          AFI48-123 5 NOVEMBER 2013


     5.3.1.1. The individual is precluded from a reasonable fulfillment of the purpose of his or
     her employment in the military service.
     5.3.1.2. The individual’s health or well-being would be compromised if he or she were to
     remain in the military service. This includes, but is not limited to: dependence on
     medications or other treatments requiring frequent clinical monitoring, special handling
     or severe dietary restrictions.
     5.3.1.3. The individual’s retention in the military service would prejudice the best
     interests of the government. Questionable cases are referred to AFPC/DPANM or to the
     appropriate ARC/SG for those ARC members who are not on EAD and are not
     authorized disability processing.
     5.3.1.4. The individual has an EPTS defect/condition which requires surgery, but the
     residuals of surgery may affect his/her retainability. In such cases, surgery may not be
     done until the expected results have been evaluated via I/RILO or MEB, and the member
     has been returned to duty.
     5.3.1.5. Individuals requiring exemption from one or more components of the fitness test
     for greater than one year do not require I/RILO or MEB unless the underlying condition
     or limitation does not meet retention or deployment standards.
     5.3.1.6. The individual’s travel by military air transportation is precluded for medical
     reasons.
     5.3.1.7. The individual has an assignment, TDY or deployment canceled due to a
     medical condition. Present case to the DAWG within 10 calendar days IAW AFI 41-210.
     The DAWG will evaluate if member meets retention medical standards or if deployment
     limiting condition will resolve within 365 days. If not, the DAWG must refer cases to
     AFPC/DPANM, AFRC/SGP or ANG/SGP. (T-1)
     5.3.1.8. The individual continues to have a mobility limiting condition 1 year
     (cumulatively) after the defect became limiting and has not yet met an I/RILO/MEB or
     Fitness for Duty (FFD).
     5.3.1.9. The individual has been hospitalized 90 calendar days and return to duty within
     3 more months is not expected. I/RILO or FFD should be sent to AFPC/DPANM or
     appropriate ARC/SGP as determined by the DAWG.
     5.3.1.10. The individual refuses required medical, surgical, or dental treatment or
     diagnostic procedures and the condition renders them not qualified for retention and/or
     mobility.
     5.3.1.11. The individual requires determination of his or her competency for pay
     purposes.
     5.3.1.12. The individual has had a sanity determination required by the Manual for
     Courts-Martial and the psychiatric findings indicate the member’s fitness for continued
     military service is questionable.
     5.3.1.13. The individual has coexisting medical defects that are thought to be the primary
     cause of unacceptable behavior or unsatisfactory performance.
AFI48-123 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                      27


     5.3.1.14. A commander can refer a service member’s case to the DAWG through the
     DAWG Chair or PEBLO, if a commander feels an individual’s medical or mental health
     condition causes sufficient absence from duty that it interferes with mission
     accomplishment, poor duty performance and/or deployment concerns.
  5.3.2. The following conditions require I/RILO or FFD initiation within 90 days of
  diagnosis: All members with organ failure requiring transplant or extensive medical
  treatment, brain injury with significant permanent physical or cognitive impairment,
  psychosis, bipolar or other mental health condition that will likely significantly impact
  member’s ability to perform AFSC duties long-term, amputation of a limb, burns greater than
  20% of body surface area (other than first degree) or resulting in loss of function or inability
  to wear personal protective equipment, blindness (bilateral, not just single eye), any terminal
  illness, seizure disorder, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (not just HIV positive),
  neoplastic diseases (a diagnosis of cancer or neoplastic disease may require additional time to
  establish a clear prognosis, will require lengthy treatment, or will be unable to perform
  his/her job for a protracted period of time), insulin dependent diabetes, and any other
  potentially career-ending condition. See AFI 41-210 for additional guidance.
  5.3.3. General Conditions That Interfere With Military Service.
     5.3.3.1. Certain conditions render an individual unsuited for duty, rather than unfit, and
     are subject to administrative separation since these conditions may interfere with military
     service. These conditions cannot be entered into the Integrated Disability Evaluation
     System (IDES). Consult AFI 36-3208 and DoDI 1332.38 for details and specific cases.
     5.3.3.2. If a service member has a history of anaphylaxis and/or severe reactions
     requiring venom immunotherapy, although unsuiting conditions, the service member will
     require an I/RILO or FFD for ALC-C consideration if retained and not administratively
     separated. (T-1)

              surgeon and RPA pilots), Initial Flying Class III, GBC, or MOD examinations,
              regardless of the nature of disqualifying defect. (T-1) Send completed DD Form
              2808, applicable portions of the DD Form 2807-1, and all associated documents
              to the appropriate certifying authority or requesting agency. (T-1) The examining
              flight surgeon completely identifies, describes and documents the disqualifying
              defects and enters demographics and disqualifying diagnosis into PEPP and
              AIMWTS, include a brief AMS with pertinent information, signs, dates and
              forwards to certification/waiver authority as defined in Attachment 2. (T-2)
              These exams must not be disqualified at the base but must be completed as noted
              above and forwarded to the certification and waiver authority. (T-1) Note: At any
              point when the examining flight surgeon learns of a medical disqualification,
              including during medical record review or when obtaining a medical history, the
              flight surgeon must complete the minimum documentation as described above.
              (T-1)
              6.1.3.1.3.2. Forward aeromedical disqualifications of untrained assets to AETC
              and of trained assets to the MAJCOM/SG for review and disposition. Local
              medical facilities do not have disqualification authority for medical cause.
              6.1.3.1.3.3. Incomplete physical examinations or those where the individual no
              longer is pursuing a Flying/SOD physical, should have the reason for termination
              and/or the attempts by the MTF to ensure the individual completes the
              examination documented in PEPP. The MTF Aerospace Medicine Specialist may
              sign the certification tab to complete the PEPP entry after indicating the exam is
              incomplete and/or examination or individual no longer requires physical
              examination. Indicate on the certification that service member is qualified for
              retention and is not qualified for Flying/SOD secondary to incomplete
              examination or that individual no longer requires a physical examination
   6.1.4. MAJCOM/SG will notify AFMSA/SG3PF of disqualified cases (rated pilots only).
   AFMSA/SG3PF will notify Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of medical
   disqualification for rated pilots only.

Section 6B—Waiver Information

6.2. General Waiver Information. For applicants applying for initial flying (all classes) and
SOD who are not currently already in the military, accessions and enlistments standards in
Chapter 4 and the Medical Standards Directory apply as well as appropriate flying/SOD
standards for which they are applying. Chapter 5 and the Medical Standards Directory apply to
personnel serving as AD or ARC (e.g., AD SSgt applying for IFCI duty must meet retention
standards and IFCI standards as reflected in the Medical Standards Directory, standards noted in
Chapter 5 and Chapter 11 of this AFI.). The medical conditions listed in the Medical
Standards Directory and Chapter 11 are cause to reject an examinee for entry into any rated
,not-rated, or career enlisted aviator crew position training(all classes), or continued flying
duty/SOD unless a waiver is granted. Additional information concerning aeromedical waivers
can be found in the aircrew waiver guide. Acute medical problems, injuries, or their appropriate
therapy are cause for withholding certification for entry into any rated ,not-rated, or career
AFI48-123 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                        31


enlisted aviator crew position training, or temporarily restricting the individual from flying until
the problem is resolved, using AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent. These standards are not all
inclusive and other diseases, or defects, can be cause for rejection based upon the judgment of
the examining flight surgeon. Any condition, that in the opinion of the flight surgeon presents a
hazard to flying safety, the individual’s health, or mission completion, is cause for temporary
disqualification for flying duties.
   6.2.1. To be considered waiverable, any disqualifying condition must meet the
   following criteria:
       6.2.1.1. Not pose a risk of sudden incapacitation. (T-1)
       6.2.1.2. Pose minimal potential for subtle performance decrement, particularly with
       regard to the higher senses. (T-1)
       6.2.1.3. Be resolved or stable, and expected to remain so under the stresses of the
       aviation environment. (T-1)
       6.2.1.4. If the possibility of progression or recurrence exists, the first symptoms or signs
       must be easily detectable and not pose a risk to the individual or the safety of others. (T-
       1)
       6.2.1.5. Cannot require exotic tests, regular invasive procedures, or frequent absences to
       monitor for stability or progression. (T-1)
       6.2.1.6. Must be compatible with the performance of sustained flying operations. (T-1)
6.3. Waiver of Medical Conditions. The individuals and organizations with authority to grant
a waiver for medically disqualifying defects are listed in 6.4 and Attachment 2. Controversial
or questionable cases, and cases that fall outside of the parameters set by this instruction and the
Medical Standards Directory, will be referred to AFMSA/SG3PF at the discretion of the
MAJCOMs.
   6.3.1. Term of Validity of Waivers.
       6.3.1.1. The waiver authority establishes the term of validity of waivers.
       6.3.1.2. An expiration date is placed on a waiver for any conditions that may progress or
       require periodic reevaluation.
       6.3.1.3. Waivers are valid for the specified condition. Any significant exacerbation of
       the condition, or other changes in the patient’s medical status, automatically invalidates
       the waiver, and they are placed in Duties Not Including Flying/Controlling (DNIF/DNIC)
       status until the medical evaluation is complete, and a new waiver is requested and
       approved.
       6.3.1.4. If a condition resolves and member is qualified by appropriate standards, or the
       condition no longer requires a medical waiver, and the individual has no other conditions
       requiring medical waiver, retire the waiver using AIMWTS with concurrence of waiver
       granting authority. (T-2) The individual who retires the waiver must annotate reason and
       MAJCOM point of contact who concurred (by name including the office symbol) in the
       “Reason for Retirement” block, before signing in AIMWTS. (T-1)

     6.4.1.10. AFMSA/SG3P retains waiver authority for all flying classes/SOD for
     immunodeficiency syndromes (primary or acquired) and confirmed presence of HIV or
     antibody.
     6.4.1.11. If AFMSA/SG3P disqualifies a service member, then second waiver requests
     for previously disqualified conditions are considered on a case-by-case basis only, and
     waiver authority for these individuals is AFMSA/SG3P.
AFI48-123 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 33


     6.4.1.12. All cases where an active flight surgeon or candidate for flight surgeon does
     not meet FC II standards and is unable to obtain a FC II waiver.
     6.4.1.13. In cases where no qualified Air Force flight surgeon is assigned to the Air
     Component Surgeon’s office, or the waiver authority is uncertain, waiver authority is
     AFMSA/SG3P.
     6.4.1.14. For cases in which AFMSA/SG3PF is waiver authority, interim waiver or
     waiver extension authority by subordinate commands is specifically denied unless
     specifically delegated by AFMSA/SG3PF for a specific case or in a delegation letter.
  6.4.2. MAJCOM retains waiver authority as follows:
     6.4.2.1. MAJCOM certification and waiver authority for flying and SOD medical
     standards may only be accomplished by a specialist in aerospace medicine.
     MAJCOM/SGs who are not an Aerospace Medicine Specialist (AFSC 48A) will delegate
     their authority to an Aerospace Medicine Specialist on their staff. If the MAJCOM/SG is
     an Aerospace Medicine Specialist (AFSC 48A), authority may be delegated to qualified
     Aerospace Medicine Specialists (AFSC 48A) on their staff. When MAJCOM/SG desires
     to delegate MAJCOM Aeromedical Waiver authority to a Senior Flight Physician who is
     not an Aerospace Medicine Specialist, a waiver can be requested by MAJCOM/SG from
     AFMSA/SG3PF for a Senior Flight Surgeon to be delegated as a MAJCOM Aeromedical
     Waiver Authority.
     6.4.2.2. MAJCOM/SG or delegated authority may grant initial and renewal waivers for
     all routine ACS clinical management group evaluations as defined by this AFI.
        6.4.2.2.1. If delegated to the MAJCOM, categorical waivers (except IIC for
        pregnancy) for grade below Colonel need a copy of the waiver action sent to
        AFPC/DPAOT3, 550 C Street West Ste 31, Randolph AFB, TX 78150. Categorical
        waivers (except IIC for pregnancy) for Colonel (0-6) need a copy of the waiver action
        sent to: AF/DPO 1040 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1040. All FCIIC
        waiver actions delegated to MAJCOM/SG require memorandum cover letter by
        MAJCOM/SG be forwarded to AF/SGE, Attn: AFMSA/SG3PF, 1780 Air Force
        Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1780 and USAF/A3OT, 1480 AF Pentagon
        Washington, DC 20032-1480, to include FCIIC waiver renewals. Ensure the
        categorical restrictions are contained in the memorandum. Note: ARC does not have
        a requirement to forward FCIIA, FCIIB, FCIIC, and FCIIU waivers to AF/DPO or
        AF/DPG.
     6.4.2.3. Medical waiver authority has been delegated to the MAJCOM to which the
     member is assigned for duty unless specifically noted in 6.4.1 For example a member’s
     MAJCOM is ACC, but they are assigned Permanent change of Station (PCS) to USAFE.
     The gaining MAJCOM (USAFE) becomes the certification and waiver authority in
     accordance with Table A2.1. If the member belongs to a tenant unit of one MAJCOM
     and the tenant unit is on the base of another MAJCOM, then the medical waiver belongs
     to the tenant unit’s MAJCOM. For example a C-21 pilot stationed at Keesler AFB
     (AETC) is a member of the AMC tenant unit located at Keesler AFB; AMC is the waiver
     authority for delegated conditions.

     AFSOC/SG. Medical waiver authority for personnel assigned to NORTHCOM is
     delegated to AFSPC/SG.
  6.4.3. Delegation of Waiver Authority for Flying and SOD Personnel:
     6.4.3.1. Command and USAFA surgeons may delegate waiver authority to another
     command surgeon or to a Residency Trained Aerospace Medicine specialist working on
     that MAJCOM staff (Aerospace Medicine Specialist (AFSC 48A), AFSC 48A3/48A4 or
     ARC 48R3/48R4). Exceptions will be approved by AFMSA/SG3P. Command surgeons
     IAW 2.3.3. may delegate base level (local) waiver authority to the installation Aerospace
     Medicine Specialist or most qualified Flight Surgeon, most likely the SGP. Waiver
     delegation will indicate authority based on residency trained Aerospace Medicine
     Specialist (Aerospace Medicine Specialist (AFSC 48A)) versus non Aerospace Medicine
     Specialist. Note: Authority to grant flying class III waivers to rated personnel who have
     been medically disqualified for flying class II is delegated to the member’s
     MAJCOM/SG of assignment. See 6.4.1.11
        6.4.3.1.1. Local Base Certification/Waiver Authority (AD only). Flight surgeons as

        not be delegated further. (T-1) At locations with flight surgeons who do not meet this
        criteria, the certification/waiver authority reverts to the MAJCOM of assignment.
        Non-flight surgeons are not authorized to sign, or certify medical examinations. (T-1)
        Flight surgeons granted this authority by their MAJCOM may not certify/waiver
        ARC aircrew members. (T-1) Note: Limited scope MTFs may delegate to a
        supporting MTF’s Senior Aeromedical Specialist with MAJCOM approval and
        delegation. (T-2)
     6.4.3.2. Certification and waiver authority for assignment into ARC flying positions may
     not be delegated lower than MAJCOM/SG level unless authorized by ARC/SG.
        6.4.3.2.1. Delegation of this certification authority is extended only to those Reserve
        Medical units responsible for providing physical exam support.
     6.4.3.3. AD non-aircrew members transitioning into ARC flying positions must have
     their medical examinations certified by the appropriate ARC Surgeon.

     6.4.3.6. AETC/SGPS is the certification and waiver authority for all ARC members
     entering AD in the regular Air Force. Before ARC members will be considered for
     waiver for AD in the regular Air Force, all disqualifying defects must be noted, reviewed,
     evaluated and waived by the ARC waiver authority. Waiver by the ARC authority does
     not guarantee waiver for regular Air Force duty.
  6.4.4. Centralized Flying Waiver Repository (AIMWTS).
     6.4.4.1. AIMWTS will serve as the centralized flying waiver repository.
     6.4.4.2. All flying medical waiver actions will be recorded in AIMWTS.
     6.4.4.3. Flying waivers that are no longer required due to personnel separation and/or
     retirement should be allowed to expire.

     6.4.5.1. The medical service does not make recommendations for medical waivers for
     entry or retention in non-flying or SOD AFSCs for those who fall below qualification
     standards imposed by personnel directives.         Any flying or special operational
     restrictions/limitations must comply with 6.4.1.9 Medical waivers will not be granted to
     allow an individual disqualified from one AFSC to enter another AFSC, when the defect
     is disqualifying for both AFSCs.
     6.4.5.2. When requested, the medical service provides professional opinion to line or
     personnel authorities.
  6.4.6. Submission of Reports of Medical Examination to Certification or Waiver
  Authority.
     6.4.6.1. Initial certification, waiver requests and disqualification recommendations for all
     flying, MOD and SOD examinations will be submitted using PEPP and/or AIMWTS.
     Submissions to the reviewing/certification authority using PEPP and/or AIMWTS must
     be accomplished simultaneously (e.g. do not submit AIMWTS without submitting
     physical in PEPP if you accomplished one). Supporting documents must be uploaded as
     attachments into these applications and forwarded to the reviewing/certification authority.
     Do not accomplish DD Form 2808, or PHA solely for the purpose of a waiver submission
     unless flight surgeon deems necessary, or directed by higher authority. Note: PHA, SF
     600, Medical Record – Chronological Record of Medical Care, or DD Form 2808 must
     be accomplished according to the frequency in AFI 44-170 and is irrespective of waiver
     action. (T-1)
     6.4.6.2. All waiver requests referred to AFMSA/SG3P must be submitted through the
     MAJCOM/SG. (T-1) MAJCOM/SG must provide a recommendation on the case to
     AFMSA/SG3P through AIMWTS in the forwarding remarks. If a waiver requires an
     ACS evaluation or review, the MAJCOM/SG must request the ACS evaluation/review.
     The MAJCOM/SG will not forward to AFMSA/SG3P until the ACS evaluation/review
     results are completed and documented in AIMWTS. Note: In the case of unapproved
     medications, MAJCOM/SG will send to AFMSA/SG3P who will review and determine
     appropriate action.
     6.4.6.3. All waiver requests must include as a minimum: (T-1)
 36                                                          AFI48-123 5 NOVEMBER 2013

non-flight surgeon medical providers’ entries in the member’s medical record. (T-1) A
grounding AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent initiated by a non-flight surgeon medical provider
must be reviewed, countersigned and dated by the DoD FS, however, effective date will be the
date issued. (T-1) Only a flight surgeon can return flying/SOD to flying/SOD or continue them
on flying/SOD during/after a medical encounter IAW AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules. (T-
1) Exception: HQ AF/SG delegates to the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) Commander the
authority to grant AFSOC Physician Assistants (PAs) working independently in support of
Special Operations Command missions, aeromedical disposition privileges when deployed and
without reasonable access to a FS preceptor, IAW AFI 48-149. (T-1)
   6.6.1. Personnel on flying or SOD status who receive dental treatment will be managed IAW
   AFI 47-101, Managing Air Force Dental Services. Dental personnel will use AF Form 1418,
   Recommendation for Flying or Special Operation Duty – Dental, to notify the flight surgeon
   of recommended flying or special duty restrictions exceeding 8 hours. The reviewing flight
   surgeon should then initiate a DNIF via AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent. (T-1) See AFI 47-
   101, Paragraph 6.16. for further details.
   6.6.2. Aeromedical Disposition of ARC Personnel On Air Sovereignty Alert (ASA),
   Total Force Initiative (TFI) units or Federal RPA missions. ARC aviation personnel
   performing ASA, TFI, or operating large RPA systems in support of a Federal mission are
   eligible for AD grounding management (DNIF and RTFS) and care for acute medical
   conditions that if not addressed would negatively impact completion of that mission. Note:
   Routine medical care is not authorized and remains the responsibility of the Airman via
   his/her regular health care provider.
       6.6.2.1. If a flight surgeon is not co-located with the flying operation, these aircrew may
       be seen by a non-flight surgeon health care provider (military or civilian). The aircrew
       must inform the provider that written or verbal communication of the details of the visit
       (including history, physical, and treatment provided) must be submitted to the appointed
       military flight surgeon immediately following the visit. (T-1) The flight surgeon may
       render an aeromedical disposition determination remotely if he/she has sufficient
       information, and after communicating both with the provider and the aircrew member.
       The flight surgeon must be confident that there has been sufficient resolution of
       symptoms and treatment side effects. (T-1) All relevant medical and medication
       standards still apply. Aeromedical disposition decision must be communicated
       immediately to the aircrew’s unit. (T-1) The AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent must be
       sent electronically to the aircrew’s unit the morning of the next duty day. (T-1)
       6.6.2.2. Aircrew and special duty personnel in locations not co-located with an AD base
       may be returned to flying status to perform alert, combat or National Air Defense duties
       when their unit flight surgeon is not available. These personnel may be returned to

      flying/SOD status after being examined by a military or civilian physician via reach-back
      consultation with a military flight surgeon as designated by AFMSA/SGPF.
      6.6.2.3. ANG or AFRC flight surgeons who maintain active credentials and privileges in
      Flight Medicine may use their Flight Medicine credentials to make aeromedical
      dispositions while employed in a civilian Flight Medicine physician role.
6.7. Prepare a new AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent when an individual is:
   6.7.1. Found temporarily medically unfit—described as DNIF, DNIC or Duties Not to
   Include Alert (DNIA).
   6.7.2. Determined by a flight surgeon to be fit for RTFS or RTC/A (Return to
   Controling/Alert) for SOD.
   6.7.3. Medically certified for     flying by appropriate       review authority following
   disqualification.
   6.7.4. Medically certified for continued flying/SOD following medical examinations.
   6.7.5. To temporarily “ground” or clear aircrew following involvement in any class of
   aircraft mishap.
   6.7.6. To permanently medically disqualify a member for flying or SOD.
      6.7.6.1. Only after MAJCOM or higher authority certifies examination in AIMWTS,
      permanent disqualification authority is the same for waiver actions as noted in
      Attachment 2. Also, refer to 6.1.3.1.3.2. Note: An AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent
      does not need to be accomplished with the expiration of a flying PHA. The HARM
      Office will take appropriate administrative action if a new AF Form 1042 or DoD
      equivalent is not received by the expiration date.
6.8. Form Completion:
   6.8.1. AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent must contain the date the individual is actually
   found certified. (T-1)
   6.8.2. Date of the flight surgeon signature will serve as the date the action was
   accomplished. (T-1) For DNIF action signed by another provider the flight surgeon only
   needs to countersign the provider signature as the date the form was initiated needs to be the
   action date.
   6.8.3. If the examination cannot be completed prior to expiration due to reasons beyond the
   member’s control, and the patient has a flying medical waiver that will expire, the examining
   flight surgeon may request a waiver extension from the appropriate MAJCOM/SG. If
   granted, a new AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent must be accomplished to reflect the
   extension and sent to the member’s HARM Office as specified in this chapter. (T-1) Note:
   Only extensions in AIMWTS are authorized. If an extension to an existing waiver is
   warranted, waiver extension must be recorded in AIMWTS and a new waiver renewal
   initiated at base level. (T-1)
   6.8.4. Flyers and SOD personnel unavailable for PHA secondary to deployment will follow
   guidance in AFI 44-170.
AFI48-123 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   39


   6.8.5. The remarks section of the AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent can be used for local
   special purpose determinations, i.e., “May perform Supervisor of Flying duties,” with the
   determination based upon the flight surgeon’s assessment of the member’s mental alertness
   and physical capabilities. The remarks section of the 1042 may also be used by FS to
   comment on Special Tactics/Combat Rescue operator dispositions regarding jump, dive,
   control status/clearance as determined by the credentialed FS (ie…may control/dive,
   continue DNIF). The Remarks section of any AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent leaving the
   MTF will not have member’s diagnosis or other protected health care information written or
   otherwise affixed in accordance with HIPAA rules. (T-0) Commanders must be advised to
   contact the flight surgeons office if more details about a member’s condition are required.
   6.8.6. Inactive Flyers. Do not complete DNIF or RTFS on an AF Form 1042 or DoD
   equivalent for individuals in inactive aviation service categories. The exceptions are for
   individuals who are collecting flight pay or plan to go back to active flying. Completion of
   the AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent for these exceptions notifies ARMS that member
   completed their PHA, potential permanent disqualifying condition is recognized, or an
   aeromedical waiver may be required.
6.9. AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent Distribution:
   6.9.1. Original to patient’s health record. For transient personnel, send the original and 2
   copies to the individual’s home MTF flight medicine clinic for distribution.
   6.9.2. Grounding management communications with operational units and HARM offices
   must be treated as Protected Health Information (PHI). (T-0) Release of this information to
   operational units, commanders and HARM offices is allowed under DoD 6025.18-R, DoD
   Health Information Privacy Regulation. This release of PHI must be documented as an
   accountable disclosure IAW AFI 41-210, Section 6D.
      6.9.2.1. The ASIMS database is currently installed with a HIPAA-compliant
      documentation log for any releases of PHI sent via email notification from within
      ASIMS. All such actions automatically generate an electronic log entry to document
      each release of PHI. This function includes e-mail notification to operational flying/SOD
      units and HARM offices regarding AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent grounding
      management actions.
      6.9.2.2. In addition to email notifications, a signed copy of the AF Form 1042 or DoD
      equivalent must still be provided to the HARM office for inclusion in the member’s flight
      Record. This action constitutes its own release of PHI and must also be documented. To
      prevent unnecessary additional workload, the email notification template in the
      Grounding Management module of ASIMS states: “A signed copy of this grounding
      management action is also being forwarded to the HARM office for inclusion in the
      member’s Flight Record Folder.”
      6.9.2.3. One copy to the local HARM Office (within 1 duty day) for flying/SOD
      personnel, or to the unit commander or supervisor for other personnel using the HIPAA
      compliant documentation log within the e-mail notification of the grounding management
      module.

       6.9.2.4. One copy to the member’s unit. Note: Flight medicine clinics maintain current
       and accurate unit and HARM office Point of Contact information in the email notification
       database as HIPAA requires the capability to identify all recipients of PHI.
       6.9.2.5. One copy to the member.
       6.9.2.6. Flying PHA performed by a non-AF flight surgeon requires review and
       certification by parent MAJCOM/SG if no AF flight surgeon is available at that location.
6.10. Disposition of Expired AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent:
   6.10.1. Grounding actions such as DNIF, DNIC, DNIA, dispose of when superseded by an
   AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent for RTFS action.
   6.10.2. Remove previous PHA clearances when superseded by a new PHA clearance AF
   Form 1042 or DoD equivalent.
   6.10.3. Do not remove AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent recording a member’s RTFS
   following a period of DNIF, medical clearance post mishap or return to flight status from the
   outpatient medical record. These must remain a permanent part of a member’s medical
   record. (T-1)
6.11. Record of Action. The flight surgeon office maintains a monthly log of restrictions and
re-qualifications on AF Form 1041, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational
Duty Log, and disposes of AF Form 1041 as specified by Air Force Records Disposition
Schedule. Use the AF Form 1041 log to track personnel who are in DNIF, DNIC, or DNIA
status. AF Form 1041 is included within ASIMS.
6.12. General Officer Notification. The flight medicine PCM will notify their MAJCOM/SG
or designee by telephone during duty hours when a general officer or wing commander is
grounded. Reports will include: date of DNIF, aeronautical rating, ASC with AFSC, duty title
and organization, diagnosis (es), estimated duration of DNIF (as applicable), and name and duty
phone of attending flight surgeon. (T-2) Also, notify the MAJCOM/SG or designee when the
GO or Wg/CC is RTFS. (T-2) Note: ANG does not require notification of the grounding of
general officers or Wing Commanders.
6.13. Death Notification. The flight medicine PCM will notify their MAJCOM/SG or designee
by telephone during duty hours when an aircrew or SOD member dies. (T-2) Reports will

       6.20.1.2. The DoD Optical Fabrication Enterprise will fabricate prescription clear and/or
       neutral density gray (N-15) sun protection as prescribed in an authorized AFF spectacle
       frame. (T-2) No other sun protection tint or spectacle frame is authorized for use in
       USAF aircraft by USAF military, civil service or contracted aircrew. The eye clinic will
       order the required spectacles through the DoD Optical Fabrication Enterprise in the same
       manner as other military eyewear orders through the Spectacle Request Transmission
       System (SRTS). (T-2) The eye clinic will fit and issue aviation spectacles to USAF
       military, civil service and contracted aircrew. (T-2) Eye clinics may also order AFF
       replacement parts (nose pads, temple screws, temples, etc) using MTF unit funds through
       the Electronic Catalog. (T-2)
       6.20.1.3. USAF aircrew requiring prescription eyewear are authorized four sets of AFF
       spectacles per year, or as required. Two of these sets are fabricated with clear
       prescription lenses. The remaining two are fabricated as neutral density (gray) 15%
       transmission (N-15) sunglasses. Contractor aircrew requiring prescription eyewear are
       authorized two sets of AFF spectacles per year, one set with clear prescription lenses and
       one set with neutral density gray (N-15) sunglasses. USAF military, civil service or

      density gray tinted sunglasses and laser eye protection when operationally authorized.
      However, aircrew with defective color vision are not authorized to wear the yellow high
      Contrast visor.
   6.20.3. Ballistic Eye Protection: The Air Force Ballistic Protective Eyewear (BPE)
   Program manages the Air Force Protective Eyewear List (AFPEL) and provides
   implementation guidance. The Air Force adopted the Army’s Authorized Protective
   Eyewear List (APEL). Products on the APEL have been evaluated by the Army Program
   Executive Office and found to meet or exceed military ballistic standards. AFPEL items are
   intended for ground use. Ballistic protection for authorized aircrew is found on the Flight
   Protective Eyewear List (FPEL). The AFF series frames are not equivalent to BPE. Flight
   ballistic protective eyewear (non-prescription spectacle/goggles) are obtained through local
   Aircrew Flight Equipment or equivalent supply office through the member’s unit.
   Prescription inserts for FPEL items are ordered by the local optometry clinic through the
   SRTS ordering program. Current APEL and FPEL available at USAF Optometry
   Knowledge Junction / BPE: https://www.kx.ams.mil/optometry and USAF Flight Medicine

Section 6I—Missile Operations Duty (MOD) Standards

6.23. The medical conditions listed in Chapter 5, Medical Standards Directory, and Section
6I are cause to reject MOD personnel for initial accession in and continued missile
operations (AFSC 13SXC) career field unless a waiver is granted. The certification authority
for initial MOD examinations and waivers is AFGSC/SGP. For conditions listed in Chapter 5,
ensure an I/RILO or MEB has been initiated if appropriate prior to the waiver request.
6.23.1. Acute medical problems, injuries, or their appropriate therapy can be cause for
withholding certification for initial training or temporarily restrict the individual from MOD until
the problem is resolved. These standards are not all-inclusive, and other diseases, or defects, are
cause for rejection based upon the medical judgment of the examining flight surgeon. Acute
conditions which impair safe and effective performance of duty are cause for temporary removal
from MOD using AF Form 1042 or DoD equivalent IAW Section 6C.
   6.23.2. Medication (See Approved MOD List on AFMSA Knowledge Junction).
       6.23.2.1. Personnel may not perform Combat Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission
       Capable (BMC) duties (AFGSCI 13-5301v3, Rapid Execution and Combat Targeting
       (REACT) Crew Operations paragraph 6.1.) while using any medication whose known
       common adverse effect or intended action(s) affect alertness, judgment, cognition, special
       sensory function, mood or coordination.(T-2) CMR and/or BMC personnel prescribed
       medication with these known common adverse effect or intended action(s) must be
       placed in DNIC or DNIA status while under their effects. (T-2) If chronic or long-term
       use of such medications is required, a medical waiver must be requested. Approval
       authority is the AFGSC/SGP. (T-2)
       6.23.2.2. MOD personnel in non-CMR/BMC positions do not require DNIA/DNIC
       action for medications unless the underlying medical condition requires medical waiver
       action or the medication may affect alertness, judgment, cognition, special sensory
       function, mood or coordination and the medication use is anticipated as a long term
       maintenance medication. In such cases waiver work up and application is required before
       removal of the DNIA/DNIC action.
       6.23.2.3. FDA-approved OTC medications and commercially available (in the United
       States) substances, to include herbal and nutritional supplements, may generally be used
       by MOD personnel without flight surgeon approval, provided the product is used in
       accordance with manufacturers' directions for its intended use and not in violation of Air
       Force policy.
           6.23.2.3.1. MOD personnel are required to consult with the flight surgeon whenever:
           the member is within 12 hours of reporting for MOD and will be using the product for
           the very first time; or member experiences adverse reactions which may affect the
           member's ability to perform MOD.

Section 6J—Miscellaneous Categories

6.24. Requirements.
   6.24.1. Attendance at Sister Service Schools. All personnel who require upgrade training
   or specialty training at sister services schools must meet any additional Sister Service
   medical requirements (which may be more restrictive). AETC/SGPS will initially certify
   these types of examinations to meet Air Force AFSC requirements, with the exception of
   static line (Airborne) not requiring a waiver which may be certified by the local aerospace
   medicine specialist as designated by the MAJCOM. Certification by AF does not guarantee
   Sister Service acceptance. Applicants must provide a copy of the AF exam to the medical
   staff of the sister service school with their application. (T-2)
      6.24.1.1. Refer to US Army Regulation (AR) AR 40-501, Standards of Medical Fitness
      for most current requirements for attendance at Army schools. Note: See AF Physical
      Examination Techniques which contains AF and Sister Service requirements.
      6.24.1.2. See Manual of the Medical Department NAVMED P-117, Article 15-102 for

      contains AF and Sister Service requirements.
   6.24.2. Operational Support Flying (OSF) Duty.
      6.24.2.1. The conditions listed in Chapter 5, the Medical Standards Directory and this
      section are disqualifying for OSF personnel. Operational support applies to personnel
      fully qualified in non-aircrew specialties and required to temporarily perform duties of
      the specialty in-flight. OSF are required to occasionally fly. Since the member's primary
      full-time duties do not require him or her to be on board an aircraft, performance of in-
      flight duties is a special duty for the particular career field. Examples of operational
      support flyers are CCATT members.
      6.24.2.2. Personnel who perform aviation duties as an OSF are required to have a normal
      examination of tympanic membranes, lungs and chest, heart, abdomen, neurologic,
      hemoglobin, weight, blood pressure and pulse documented in their health record for an
      initial examination. The exam’s expiration date is the PHA expiration date. Note: AF
      Form 1042 or DoD equivalent is issued as satisfactory evidence of completion of the
      requirements outlined for training and duty. This examination does not need to be
      entered into PEPP.
   6.24.3. Physiologic Training Participation
      6.24.3.1. Individuals must have the appropriate medical clearance to be eligible for
      physiological training (i.e. hypobaric chamber, reduced oxygen breathing device [ROBD]
      and/or centrifuge training). See AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program
      and/or AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew for additional information.
      See “Medical Standards Directory” for details on specific conditions which typically
      exclude             trainees             from           physiological            training

  6.24.4. Duty Requiring Use of Night Vision Goggles (NVG).
     6.24.4.1. Aircrew members and SOD personnel who wear NVGs in the performance of
     their duties are required to achieve at least 20/50 visual acuity with the NVGs in the pre-
     flight test lane. Aircrew who fail visual acuity standards for their flying class, complain
     of visual problems either with or without NVGs, or fail to achieve 20/50 visual acuity in
     the NVG pre-flight test lane must be referred for a clinical eye examination. The flight
     surgeon/PA must refer to AL-SR-1992-0002, Night Vision Manual for Flight Surgeons,
     for additional guidance.
         6.24.4.1.1. Personnel required to inspect, maintain or certify NVGs for use by
         Aircrew must possess visual acuity of at least 20/20 corrected or uncorrected in each
         eye. Prior to being assigned these duties, technicians will be referred for a routine
         clinical eye examination. Results will be documented in their medical records and re-
         certified annually as long as their duties include NVG inspection, maintenance, or
         certification. Technicians with visual acuity less than 20/20 will be issued spectacles
         IAW 6.24.4.2 to correct their vision. Technicians who cannot attain visual acuity of
         20/20 corrected or uncorrected in each eye will be restricted from performing NVG
         inspection, maintenance or certification. (T-2)
     6.24.4.2. Each aircrew or SOD member who requires corrective lenses in order to meet
     the visual acuity standards for flying, and who are required to wear NVGs in the
     performance of flying duties, are encouraged to wear soft contact lenses (SCL) with
     appropriate correction. Members who cannot, or do not wish to, wear SCLs are to wear
     industrial safety lenses (polycarbonate or 3.0 mm thick CR-39 plastic) when using NVG.
     Two pairs of aircrew spectacles with safety lenses ground to the appropriate correction
     can be obtained in the following manner:
         6.24.4.2.1. If the individual has not had a refraction done within the past year, obtain
         a current refraction.
         6.24.4.2.2. Order aviator spectacles using the current prescription through the local
         optometry clinic, or send the prescription using a DD Form 771, Eyewear
         Prescription, to the USAFSAM Aircrew Program Manager. Include verification of
         NVG duties statement when ordering the spectacles. See KX for further details.

          anthropometric standards will be referred to the flying unit or wing commander (O-6
          or above) for final authority disposition. (T-1) ACES-II ejection attempts above 340
          KEAS (Knots Equivalent Air Speed) can result in increased injury risk due to limb
          flail and drogue chute opening shock for body weights below 140 pounds. ACES-II
          ejection attempts above 400 KEAS with body weights in excess of 211 pounds
          increase the risk of injury. Commanders may consider weight waivers and/or impose
          airspeed restrictions in the incentive or orientation flight profiles. Commanders
          waiving weight specifications must ensure the individual selected for incentive or
          orientation flight is briefed on the increase of injury risk prior to flight. Buttock-to-
          knee waivers to exceed maximum length are not authorized. The examining flight
          surgeon and MAJCOM/SG do not have waiver authority for indoctrination and

   10.6.4. Applicants applying for a new aircrew position, rather than the one previously held
   will require an initial flying exam. Applicants whose Reserve Component Health Risk
   Assessment (RCHRA) or PHA is greater than 12 months old will require a current enlistment
   or flying exam as appropriate.
10.7. Reenlistment. Ensure members who want to reenlist in the ANG have a current PHA.
Ensure members, who want to reenlist in AFRC, complete a current RCHRA unless a PHA or
RCHRA less than 12 months is on file.
10.8. Reinforcement Designees Pay or Points. Annually, prepare the appropriate form for
Reinforcement Designees not participating for pay or points. Members who feel their medical
qualification is in question attach medical documentation to the appropriate form and return the
entire package to HQ ARPC/DSFS, Denver, CO 80280-5000.
10.9. General Officers. ANG medical units will maintain the annual PHA accomplished on
general officers and ANG wing commanders in the medical records. Reserve medical units will
forward to HQ AFRC/SGPS, a copy of all physical examinations accomplished on reserve wing
commanders.
10.10. AGR Tours. The AGR program requires individual applicants to contact the appropriate
ARC medical unit, or AD MTF, to request the appropriate medical evaluation. The following
guidance along with AFI 36-2132V2, Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) Program, and ANGI 36-101,
Air National Guard Active Guard Reserve (AGR) Program, will be used to manage these
requests.
   10.10.1. General. Members selected for initial AGR positions must meet the medical
   standards as outlined in this AFI prior to assignment. Applicants who have started an AGR
   tour and are found to have medical conditions(s) which makes their medical qualifications
   for continued military duty questionable will be processed through the Air Force DES IAW
   AFI 36-3212.
   10.10.2. Physical Exam Requirements.
       10.10.2.1. Applicants with a concurrent AGR assignment must have a current PHA on
       file.
       10.10.2.2. Applicants with no service affiliation (i.e. Individual Ready Reserve (IRR),
       AD, reserve, guard, etc.) require an accession physical exam, which would be valid for
       24 months prior to AGR assignment. See medical standards in Chapter 4 and Chapter
       6, Medical Standards, Section 6G (aircrew applicants only).
       10.10.2.3. Active military (AD, ARC) applicants for non-aircrew assignments may use
       PHA with associated documentation less than 12 months old. Members must also be
       current in all IMR requirements. AF Form 422, must be dated within 60 days prior to
       tour start date. Medical standards in Chapter 5 and Medical Standards Directory apply.
       Prior service (IRR, etc.) applicants for non-aircrew assignments within 180 days of
       separation may use the same standards as AD. Applicants whose date of separation is
AFI48-123 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                      63


       greater than 180 days will require an accession examination and medical standards in
       Chapter 4 apply.
       10.10.2.4. For aircrew assignments into the applicant’s current aircrew AFSC, flying
       PHA with associated paperwork less than 12 months old may be used.
          10.10.2.4.1. Applicants for new aircrew assignments require an initial flying
          examination.
   10.10.3. Certification/Waiver Authority.
       10.10.3.1. AFRC/SGP is the certification and waiver authority for all AFRC AGR
       applicants.. For ANG, the SAS, having completed specialized training, is authorized
       certification authority for Title 32 AGR applicants. Medical Standards in Chapter 5,
       Medical Standards Directory and Chapter 6, Section 6G apply.
          10.10.3.1.1. The Chief, Aerospace Medicine/SAS for the ANG will certify the
          appropriate medical document with a certification stamp. Delegation of this
          certification authority is extended only to those Reserve Medical Units responsible
          for providing physical exam support.
       10.10.3.2. The appropriate ARC/SG is the reviewing, certification and waiver authority
       (see Attachment 2) for those applicants with disqualifying medical conditions in
       Chapters 4, 5, Medical Standards Directory and Chapter 6, Section 6G, except initial
       entry into IFCI/IA/II, unless otherwise directed by other guidance within this instruction.
       Also, the appropriate ARC/SG is the certification authority for all MAJCOM or higher-
       level AGR positions (ANG Title 10 EAD) and those positions with no gaining ARC
       medical units.
10.11. Involuntary EAD. ARC members involuntarily ordered to AD will not delay such
action because of an expired PHA. See AFI 44-170 for details.
   10.11.1. An ARC member ordered to EAD due to mobilization is medically processed IAW
   the mobilization order. The ARC member’s medical status must be established within 30
   days of mobilization.
   10.11.2. Within 30 days of mobilization, the health records of the ARC member will be
   reviewed for disqualifying defects according to Chapter 5 and Medical Standards Directory
   and to determine if the member’s PHA is current. Members found medically disqualified or
   questionably qualified for WWD are evaluated IAW AFI 41-210, unless otherwise directed
   by the mobilization order.
10.12. Annual Training (AT) or AD for Training or Inactive Duty for Training
(IDT). Commanders ensure members reporting for duty are medically qualified. Members with
medical conditions, which render questionable their medical qualifications for continued WWD,
are evaluated for fitness for duty.
10.13. Inactive Duty for Training.
   10.13.1. ARC members who are ill, sustain an injury, or do not consider themselves
   medically qualified for military duty can request excusal from training.
   10.13.2. If a member reports for duty and does not consider him or herself medically
   qualified for continued military service based on a diagnosis from the PCM, the ARC
 64                                                          AFI48-123 5 NOVEMBER 2013


   commander or AD supervisor will schedule the member for a medical evaluation during the
   IDT period. (T-1) If the member is not qualified for WWD, a medical evaluation is sent to
   AFRC/SGP, or NGB/SGPA as appropriate. (T-2) The member is excused from training
   pending a review of the case. Note: ARC members will be given a DLC (AF Form 469) and
   follow the guidance found in AFI 10-203.
   10.13.3. When a commander, supervisor, or medical personnel determines an ARC
   member’s medical condition is potentially unfit, he or she is evaluated by the servicing
   medical squadron and is excused from all military duties pending further medical disposition.
10.14. Medical Examination.
   10.14.1. General Information:
      10.14.1.1. Medical personnel perform medical examinations according to Chapter 1 and
      physical examination techniques.
      10.14.1.2. All personnel undergo an annual dental examination according to the PHA
      grid at the time of the PHA. Bitewing radiographs are accomplished at the discretion of
      the examining dental officer for diagnostic assistance.
      10.14.1.3. The PHA is an annual requirement for members of the ARC, IAW AFI 44-
      170, Preventive Health Assessment.
      10.14.1.4. ANG MPF and commander are notified by the ANG Medical Group when a
      member cannot continue the United Training Activity (UTA) because of a medical
      condition. AF Form 469 is used for notification, as appropriate.
   10.14.2. Dental Class III.
      10.14.2.1. AFRC members placed in dental class III are not qualified for military duty
      other than at home station until returned to Dental Class 1 or 2. Manage AFRC members
      IAW paragraph 10.16 of this instruction unless the dental officer has determined the
      member may continue reserve participation in restricted status. ANG members placed in
      Dental Readiness Class III are not IMR ready and are non-deployable. Members are
      placed on an AF Form 469 code 31 for mobility restrictions. Members in Dental
      Readiness Class III lasting for more than one year will be processed administratively
      IAW AFI 36-3209, Separation and Retirement Procedures for Air National Guard and
      Air Force Reserve Members unless the member has a dental defect defined in Section 5B
      of this instruction. Members with a dental defect defined in Section 5B of this
      instruction and the Medical Standards Directory will be processed for Initial
      RILO/MEB/WWD. More Guidance in AFI 47-101.
      10.14.2.2. The examining military dental officer has the authority to allow AFRC in
      dental class III to continue Reserve participation at home duty station only while
      undergoing corrective dental treatment. The dental officer will determine the length of
      time (not to exceed 1 year) given to a member to complete dental treatment or improve to
      at least dental class II.
          10.14.2.2.1. Aircrew members in dental class III will be placed on DNIF status
          unless the examining dental officer determines the AFRC member may continue
          reserve participation and the flight surgeon determines flying safety will not be
          compromised. (T-1) Aircrew in this status will be limited to local sorties only. (T-1)
AFI48-123 5 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                     65

              MOBILITY STANDARDS AND DEPLOYMENT CRITERIA

11.1. General Considerations. For the purposes of this instruction mobility status is an
ongoing condition where the member is free from any chronic medical conditions or limitations
other than temporary limitations (under 1 year) that would preclude an Air Force deployment or
TDY for six months in field conditions. A fitness for deployment determination is an assessment
of current medical condition. A deployment (as defined in this instruction) is defined as any
temporary duty where Contingency, Exercise, and Deployment TDY orders were issued, and the
TDY location is outside of the United States. ANG deployment is greater than 30 days
regardless of location. Conditions, which may seriously compromise the near-term well being if
an individual were to deploy, are disqualifying for mobility status or deployment duty. Medical
evaluators must consider climate, altitude, rations, housing, duty assignment, and medical
services available in theater when deciding whether an individual with a specific medical
condition is deployable. In general, a member must be able to perform duty in austere
environment with no special food, billeting, medical or equipment support for up to 179 days.
See DoDI 6490.07, Deployment-Limiting Medical Conditions for Service Members and DoD
Civilian Employees for medical standards not consistent with deployment. Also review CoCOM
reporting instructions for individuals tasked to deploy. Note: For DoD civilian employees,
DoDD1400.31, DoD Civilian Work Force Contingency and Emergency Planning and Execution,
and DoDI 1400.32, DoD Civilian Work Force Contingency and Emergency Planning Guidelines
and Procedures, See DoDI 6490.07, Deployment-Limiting Medical Conditions for Service
Members and DoD Civilian Employees and AFI 36-507, Mobilization of the Civilian Workforce
apply. Civilian Contractors shall follow DoDI 3020.41, Operational Contract Support (OCS).
(T-0)
   11.1.1. Individuals returned to duty as “fit” by PEB may not meet deployment standards.
   Such individuals, if they are retained, will have assignment limitation codes limiting or
   restricting them from deployment duties or be placed on Limited Assignment Status (LAS).
   They may be assigned or deployed with appropriate coordination per AFI 41-210.
   11.1.2. The deployment standards in DoDI 6490.07 are the minimum necessary to maintain
   mobility status (see Kx for additional USAF Guidance). (T-1) Any individual who cannot
   maintain mobility status for a chronic or recurrent medical condition must meet an initial
   RILO or MEB evaluated IAW 41-210. Note: Pregnancy does not require an MEB and is
   handled as a code 81 mobility restriction annotated on an AF Form 469. Any mobility (or
   TDY) restrictions following completion of pregnancy are detailed in AFI 36-2110,
   Assignments.
   11.1.3. Any individual having a deployment or assignment cancelled due to medical reasons
   must be referred to the DAWG within 10 calendar days for appropriate action IAW AFI 10-
   203.
   11.1.4. ARC members must have deployment criteria addressed in the Narrative Summary
   submitted in the WWD Medical Evaluation package for the purpose of enabling the ARC/SG
   to make a valid deployability determination.
 68                                                           AFI48-123 5 NOVEMBER 2013


11.2. Non-mobility status personnel (ALC-C1, 2, 3 or LAS or ANG members with a
condition waived for WWD) who have existing medical conditions may deploy if all of the
following conditions are met and approved by the gaining COCOM.
   11.2.1. The condition is not of such a nature that an unexpected worsening or physical
   trauma is likely to have a grave medical outcome or negative impact on mission execution.
   11.2.2. The condition is stable and reasonably anticipated by the pre-deployment medical
   evaluator not to worsen during the deployment under care in theater, in light of physical,
   physiological, psychological, and nutritional effects of the duties and location.
   11.2.3. Any required ongoing health care or medications must be available in-theater within
   the military health system. All special requirements (e.g. special handling, and storage) must
   receive prior approval by gaining COCOM.
   11.2.4. There is no need, or anticipation of a need, for duty limitations that preclude
   performance of duty or accommodation imposed by the medical condition (the nature of the
   accommodation must be considered).
   11.2.5. There is no need for routine evacuation out of theater for continuing diagnostics or
   other evaluations. (All such evaluations must be accomplished prior to deployment).
   11.2.6. Coordination with deployed commanders (or delegated waiver authority) may be
   required based on current conditions, host nation requirements or changing mission
   requirements.
