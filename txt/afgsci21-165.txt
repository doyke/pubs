 *(Change) 5.1. Purpose. Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness (MSE). This is a leading
 indicator that measures the unit’s ability to plan and complete scheduled maintenance events
 (inspections, periodic maintenance, etc.) and scheduled use of maintenance resources
 (static/Immediate Response (IR)/training aircraft, etc.) on-time per the maintenance plan.
 The AFGSC goal for MSE is 95 percent for aircraft maintenance and 90 percent for ICBM
 maintenance. A low MSE rate may indicate a unit is experiencing a high rate of turbulence on
 the flight line, field or back shops. MSE is primarily used as a reliability indicator for
 maintenance managers assessing the unit’s capacity to execute the scheduled maintenance plan.

*(Change) 5.1.1. A cornerstone of successful maintenance scheduling and execution is an
understanding of how the schedule is executed versus how it was scheduled to be executed.
These differences in scheduled versus actual events are only recorded in the execution phase of
the scheduling process and are called deviations. All deviations to the printed weekly
maintenance schedule will be coordinated using AF Form 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule
Coordination, or equivalent. Deviation data will be recorded so that root cause analysis can
identify the appropriate corrective actions if any are needed. Without deviation data, analysis is
impossible. Deviation data recording and analysis is the beginning of the process to continually
improve the scheduling and execution process that leads to improved unit operations. The unit
is responsible for documenting deviations to the weekly maintenance schedule and determining
the cause for each deviation. Deviations must be coordinated with the appropriate
squadron/AMU before being assigned to a specific category. Schedule deviations that result
from a sequence of events will be assigned a primary cause. A determination of the primary
cause will be made by the parties involved to arrive at a unit position. The squadron operations
officer and the AMU OIC/AMXS/MMXS maintenance operations, along with maintenance
operations, will monitor deviations to ensure they meet the criteria in this publication. When
conflicts arise, leadership of involved units will resolve them at the lowest level. All deviations
will be recorded as described in this publication.

 *(Change) 5.2.1. Compute MSE using scheduled maintenance events in the printed weekly
 schedule. In order to make this data valuable it is important that the integrity of the data be
 maintained. Additionally do not discard standard accepted scheduling practices in order to
 improve rates, e.g., scheduling all inspections on Friday or not including hourly inspections in
 the weekly schedule.

 *(Add) 5.2.1.1. The IMDS database will be used to determine whether or not the maintenance
 actions were completed on time. For example, if a maintenance event is scheduled in the
 weekly maintenance schedule for Monday through Wednesday, IMDS must show completed
 by 2359 on Wednesday for credit.

 *(Add) 5.2.1.1.1. When ICBM timeline restrictions prevent debriefing of maintenance actions
 upon return from dispatch, debriefing actions will occur at earliest opportunity following crew
 rest. Credit for completion will be based on actual date the scheduled maintenance activity was
 accomplished.

 *(Add) 5.2.1.1.2. For maintenance events extending into the next week, credit for completion
 is based on the last day of the scheduled event. ICBM periodic inspection, Rivet MILE phase,
 and aircraft phase completion will be measured using the completion date of the inspection.

 *(Add) 5.2.1.1.3. Aircraft maintenance supervision will standardize the scheduled duration of
 the inspection for each MDS based upon the work card deck and fix phase critical path data
 determined from historical data provided by MDSA and maintenance supervision assessments.
 Standardized durations for aircraft phase inspections will be documented and forwarded to MO
 PS&D. See Table 5.3.

 *(Change) 5.2.2. The MXG/CC may select additional areas (such as Aerospace Ground
 Equipment, Avionics Intermediate Shop, Alternate Mission Equipment, etc.) for local
 scheduling effectiveness tracking. The unit will establish standards for these programs.
 When reported to HHQ, these locally selected areas will not be included in MSE rates.
 The standards requirement is not applicable for WSA/MSA maintenance schedules;
 however, MUNS/CC may elect to create MSE requirements for internal tracking. If
 WSA/MSA units create an MSE requirement they must create a local policy with
 assigned weighted points for all maintenance actions.

 *(Change) 5.2.4. When an aircraft unit is tasked with a combat sortie generation, unscheduled
 tasking, unannounced exercise/real world contingency, or HHQ exercise that significantly
 impacts the printed weekly maintenance schedule, the plan may be revised or reprinted
 without incurring deviations. Utilizing MSE deviation Table 5.1., normal deviation reporting
 procedures will be followed once the revised or reprinted plan is finalized. The
 unaccomplished portion of the original maintenance schedule that was revised will not be
 included in the scheduling effectiveness formula.

 *(Change) Table 5.1. Aircraft MSE Deviations and Functions

DEVIATION                 FUNCTION

Maintenance (MT)          Actions canceled due to adding aircraft to the flying schedule, lack of
                          manpower, equipment or as a result of mismanagement.

Operations (OP)           Actions canceled or not completed on-time for operational
                          considerations or as a result of adding aircraft to the flying and
                          maintenance schedule to meet operations requirements. This also
                          includes maintenance events not completed due to operations group
                          actions, e.g., Aircrew Flight Equipment section not completing
                          scheduled maintenance as published in the wing weekly flying and
                          maintenance schedule.

Higher headquarters       Actions canceled or not completed as a result of higher headquarters
(HHQ)                     tasking from outside of the wing.

Weather (WX)              Actions canceled or not completed as a result of weather conditions.
Supply (SU)              Deviations that result from verified parts back order condition.

Other (OT).              Aircraft impounded after publication of the weekly schedule,
                         unscheduled major maintenance where the scheduled maintenance
                         action cannot be accomplished because of tech data restrictions,
                         aircraft off base and unable to return or as a result of
                         productivity/utilization goal days.

EXCEPTION: Any scheduled maintenance for an aircraft that is possessed by
depot/PDM/Contract Field Team (CFT), that is not complied with because the aircraft is not
released for possession as scheduled to the owning unit does not count toward MSE
computations.

(DR)                     complex road restrictions such as bridge/culvert limitations, washed
                         out roads, or any physical road condition identified during route
                         surveys that result in a canceled action.
Guards (GS)              Actions canceled as a result of lack of security forces availability to
                         meet guarding requirements (e.g. SET, fire team, airborne fire
                         team/helicopter coverage)

Higher Priority Mx       Actions canceled or not completed on-time as a result of team diverted
(DH)                     to higher priority mx per ICBM Maintenance Priority Table (AFI21-
                         202 Vol I, Missile Maintenance Management).

*(Add) 5.2.6. In addition to the MSE metric, the ICBM missile maintenance dispatch
deviation rate (Scheduling Effectiveness) is used as a management indicator to identify how
well a unit is executing daily dispatches for all field activities. Maintenance dispatches that
are deviated and canceled will be documented using the codes provided in IMDS for security
forces availability, weather, road conditions, supply, vehicle problems, team member/team
chief availability or other applicable condition codes.

*(Add) 5.2.6.1. The main focus of the dispatch deviation rate is to strengthen maintenance
managers’ ability to identify trends and causes for canceled dispatches. Each canceled
dispatch represents a missed opportunity to bring maintenance capability to bear on work
load requirements. The dispatch deviation rate provides objective data to direct process
improvements and advocate for required resources or support.

*(Add) 5.2.6.2. Missile maintenance work centers will enter teams in the daily schedule that
are necessary to meet work center production and maintenance requirements. The
maintenance schedule should not be built to a predetermined or perceived constraint in
support. In order to maximize maintenance capacity and identify limiting factors, teams
should be scheduled and deviated when a confirmed shortfall in dispatch support is
identified.

*(Add) 5.2.6.3. The ICBM dispatch deviation rate is determined by dividing the number of
dispatch deviations by the total number of scheduled dispatches. It is calculated as follows.

                            Dispatch deviation rate = [ (# of dispatch
                            deviations) / (# of scheduled dispatches) ] × 100%

                                           Chapter 1

                              MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY

1.1. Scheduling. The purpose of the wing flying hour program is to maintain the readiness of
the aircrews to assigned Designed Operational Capability (DOC) missions or to provide initial
training. It should be a planned, methodical approach to achieve this goal. Additionally, the
weekly flying and maintenance schedule directly dictates the workload of a major portion of
wing personnel from flight line mechanics to dining facility personnel. The program is directly
tied to wing funding and is one of the most important products the wing produces. The right
resources should be dedicated to producing an effective and efficient plan.
1.2. Annual Plan. The annual plan is the most important element of the flying hour program.
With smart planning, programming and updating of the immediate (in-year) and long-range (out-
year) programs, the challenges of managing this program can be largely eliminated. Programs
that are not carefully worked and planned waste an inordinate amount of resources in preparation
effort and may cause the unit to fall short of meeting their flying hour goals.
1.3. Planning. The more planning factors that can be built into the flying schedule, the more
stability you will have to meet the operations and maintenance workload. Additionally,
maintenance schedulers can target maintenance resources and use them more efficiently to
reduce the variation within the scheduling process. It is critical that Maintenance Data Systems
Analysis (MDSA), along with Plans, Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D), perform a
monthly maintenance, personnel and facility capability studies as part of First Look, and cross-
check this study with the flying hour program to ensure the program is supportable. If the unit’s
mission cannot be supported within the unit’s organic capacity limitations, then changes must be
made to ensure successful execution. Always be mindful that resources (personnel, aircraft, and
equipment) should not be over-tasked. When capability is exceeded, notify squadron and group
senior leadership so the plan can be adjusted to meet objectives. Remember, failure by the
schedulers to make appropriate inputs and properly project capabilities could force the wing or
squadron to try to execute a program that is not supportable.
1.4. Deployments. As the program is developed, schedulers should also consider the time
required to prepare for deployments. Scheduling normal flying or surges in the days immediately
preceding a deployment/ temporary duty (TDY) may impact the ability of maintenance personnel
to prepare the aircraft appropriately. Personnel need time to prepare for deployments (pre-
deployment briefs, out-processing and personal business). Conversely, you have a problem if
you plan to resume normal operations too quickly after returning to home station. This is a sure
way to deplete your resources, wear down your personnel, and fail to meet your programmed
goals.
1.5. Unscheduled Events. Solid planning is the key to success, but pop-up events can influence
or cause turbulence to the scheduling process. For example, poor winter weather has forced units
to heavily weigh their programs toward the good weather months via planned attrition. However,
weather being what it is—“unpredictable”-- may not materialize as planned. If this occurs, units
are then faced with a dilemma: maintain the sortie utilization (UTE) plan as is or overfly the
program. The recommended solution is to take advantage of the unexpected "good" weather and
fly. However, care must be exercised not to exceed the maintenance capability for the sake of
 6                                                          AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013


getting ahead. If you overfly or underfly the approved program by more than 10 percent, then
units should consider reflowing the balance of their flying program.
1.6. Overflys. In developing the reflow, care must also be exercised to ensure sufficient
sorties/hours remain in the months from which the sorties/hours are removed. Wings will
develop local policy to manage this resource.
1.7. Bomber FHP Management. The Bomber Operations Division (AFGSC/A3B) is the point
of contact for changes that impact the overall yearly flying program. All changes that impact the
overall programmed hours or sorties must be approved by 8 AF/A3 and AFGSC/A3B and
subsequently AFGSC/A3 prior to final approval by ACC/A3T. If the changes do not affect the
overall program, the unit’s OG, in coordination with the MXG, will provide a copy of the reflow
to 8 AF/A3T and AFGSC/A3B to ensure the correct numbers are being reported at the local,
MAJCOM, and Air Staff level.
1.8. Helicopter FHP Management. The Operations Training and Stan/Eval Division
(AFGSC/A3T) is the MAJCOM manager of the helicopter yearly FHP. All changes that impact
the overall programmed hours or sorties must be approved by 20 AF/A3 and AFGSC/A3T and
subsequently AFGSC/A3. Any changes to the programmed FHP should be coordinated between
the units OG and MXG, who in turn will provide a copy of the reflow to 20 AF/A3H, then
AFGSC/A3T to ensure the correct number are being reported to AF/A3O.
1.9. Surges. A surge is a method of generating an increase number of sorties and hours to make
up for short comings in meeting the FHP or ops training requirements. Surges should be
forecasted to meet aircraft availability. Scheduler will provide aircraft availability in concert
with AMXS lead pro super and operations schedulers to efficiently plan and execute a surge.

                        GENERAL RESPONSIBILITY AND POLICY

2.1. Responsibilities. Commanders at all levels are responsible for compliance with this
instruction.
2.2. Policy. This instruction provides procedures and audit methods for units to develop their
flying and maintenance scheduling program and analyze their effectiveness. It is intended to be a
local tool for operations and maintenance activities to use in support of their programs.
Reviewing reasons for deviating from the flying and maintenance schedule will allow wing
commanders (WG/CC) and staff to evaluate unit flying program and scheduling procedures.
Higher Headquarters (HHQ) management attention is directed to those areas beyond a unit's
control.
2.3. Objectives. This instruction allows units the flexibility to meet mission requirements
through effective flying and maintenance scheduling. Scheduling evaluation procedures provides
an audit trail to identify problems in flying and maintenance schedules. The primary purpose of
unit scheduling assessment is to evaluate the effectiveness of the unit's flying program in support
of combat capability.
2.4. Applicability. This publication is applicable to all AFGSC units possessing or units
supporting AFGSC aircraft.
2.5. Reporting Requirements. Units will use Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS)
reporting procedures. This includes contractor-maintained, wing-assigned aircraft. In the event
the contractor is not obligated to utilize IMDS, the MXG commander is responsible to ensure all
reporting procedures are followed.
2.6. Standards. Standards and goals assist commanders in assessing the effectiveness of unit
performance. The AFGSC aircraft maintenance scheduling effectiveness standard is 95 percent.
There are two aircraft flying scheduling effectiveness (FSE) standards developed by
AFGSC/A4M, approved by AFGSC/A4, and provided to the user each September. Overall FSE
rate is measured using recorded deviation data as outlined in Chapter 4. Operations and
Maintenance (O&M) FSE rate includes deviations only in the maintenance and operations
categories.
2.7. Waivers. Waiver authority for this publication rests with HQ AFGSC/A4V. AFGSC
waiver requests are submitted by the WG/CC. See Attachment 2, Waiver/Change Request
Format.
2.8. Standardization. Wings will develop a supplement to this instruction standardizing
scheduling practices for the wing and each assigned mission design series (MDS). Minimum
topics will include standardized flying windows, specific surge rules, quiet hour policies, cross
country take-offs and returns, minimum turn times, crew ready times, etc. Supplements will
include local schedule input and publishing deadlines along with any wing unique requirements.
2.9. Airframe Capability and Scheduling. To ensure accurate projection of operations and
maintenance capacity, units will compute airframe capabilities using only the number of Primary
Aircraft Inventory (PAI) aircraft; do not include Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI) or attrition
reserve aircraft. Operational and training schedules will be based on the capability of PAI aircraft
 8                                                          AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013


to execute the schedule. The OG/CC and MXG/CC will ensure BAI and attrition reserve aircraft
are not computed when building the flying program.
2.10. Alert Aircraft. Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) officer in charge (OIC) and
Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC) will ensure aircraft entering or coming off alert
are managed to avoid Hangar Queen status as a result of extended idle alert periods. MDSA will
review sortie performance and reliability trends of aircraft coming off alert/immediate response
(IR) and present performance analysis to affected AMU and MO supervision.
2.11. Electronic Publishing. Plans and schedules may be published via electronic means (e.g.,
web pages or e-mail) provided operations security is not compromised. Normal daily operations
and training schedules are FOUO and should not be restricted to classified systems.

             FLYING AND MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING PROCEDURES

3.1. Flying and Maintenance Planning Cycle. The objective of the flying and maintenance
planning cycle is to execute the wing flying hour program (FHP) consistent with operational
requirements (AFI 11-102, Flying Hour Program Management) and maintenance capabilities.
These procedures enhance operations and maintenance interface. The flying and maintenance
planning cycle begins with the annual allocation of flying hours and UTE, refer to AFI 11-102
AFGSCSUP, Flying Hour Program Management for additional information on flying hour
allocation and planning procedures. Maintenance schedulers must understand operational needs
to determine supportability and operations schedulers must consider maintenance capabilities.
Maintenance and operations schedulers will develop a proposed annual flying plan balancing
both operational requirements and maintenance capabilities. The annual plan, detailed by month,
will evaluate the capability of maintenance to support the annual flying hour program. OSS
Current Operations Flight operations scheduling will coordinate, consolidate and forward the
plan to the current operations flight commander, AMXS/CC and Maintenance Operations Officer
(MOO), Munitions Officer/Munitions Control, MO/OIC and MO PS&D. The printed wing plan
will include an assessment of the wing’s ability to execute the flying hour program. The plan will
be presented to the OG and MXG CCs for approval before being approved by the WG/CC.
Commit the fewest number of aircraft possible to meet programmed UTE standards and goals.
The annual plan is further refined into quarterly/monthly operations and maintenance plans and
then into weekly schedules using the guidelines contained in the following sub-paragraphs.
   3.1.1. The number and length of sorties are of prime consideration in planning to meet
   programmed UTE standards/goals based on FHP development based on RAP models or
   course syllabus.
   3.1.2. Principal areas of concern are in the overall flying schedules. For mission
   accomplishment and improved efficiency, the following must be considered: maximize crew
   training on all flights, plan alternate missions when possible, ensure configurations and fuel
   loads are accurate, establish launch and recovery patterns, and utilize historical attrition data.
3.2. The Proposed Flying Hour Program Requirements.
   3.2.1. Proposed FHP process. The proposed FHP process initiates funding and a unit’s
   FHP for the next fiscal year. MO PS&D and OSS/OSO lead the development of their Wing’s
   proposed FHP. It’s critical that all operational requirements are reviewed and weighed
   against maintenance capability factors. Units will ensure thorough coordination with all
   assigned squadrons, aircraft maintenance, 8 AF and AFGSC/A3 prior to ACC submission.
       3.2.1.1. Developing the proposed FHP response: MO/PS&D and OSS/OSO will
       ensure the proposed FHP process is initiated NLT 15 March. MO PS&D will request
       MDSA accomplish an airframe, personnel, and facility capabilities assessment, using
       templates for each AMU based on historical data. The capabilities are due back to MO
       PS&D no later than the last workday of March. This process identifies operational
       requirements and maintenance capability for the next fiscal year. Units will perform the
       flowing steps prior to submitting their FHP to 8 AF/A3 and subsequently AFGSC/A3.

      3.2.1.2. MO MDSA will develop an initial airframe, personnel and facility capability
      study.
      3.2.1.3. MO PS&D will refine the initial MDSA airframe capability by applying
      projected maintenance requirements to the historical data. MO PS&D will provide copies
      of the capability study to each Operations Squadron (OS) Scheduling, AMU
      OIC/NCOIC, AMXS/CC/MOO and to MXS/CC/MOO.

      May IAW AFI 11-102 and AFI11-102_AFGSCSUP); OSS/OSO will provide MO PS&D
      a copy of the proposed FHP message and a breakdown of operational requirements to
      include at a minimum, the following data:
         3.2.1.4.1. O&M days
         3.2.1.4.2. Sorties/hours/average UTE (hourly & sortie) required (programmed)
         3.2.1.4.3. Sorties/hours scheduled (programmed + attrition)
         3.2.1.4.4. Average sorties per O&M day
         3.2.1.4.5. NLT 15 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the proposed FHP message,
         MO PS&D will provide proposed FHP maintenance capability projections in a
         monthly format to OS Director of Operations, AMU OIC/NCOIC and
         AMXS/CC/MOO. Projections will include proposed FHP operational requirements,
         an assessment of maintenance’s ability to support the monthly contract requirements,
         and an overall assessment of the unit’s maintenance capability to meet the annual
         flying hour program.
      3.2.1.5. NLT 25 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the proposed FHP message, MO
      PS&D will gather the AMXS and OS coordinated responses to the Proposed FHP
      message and forward them to OSS Current Operations Flight Operations Scheduling
      Section for consolidation into a comprehensive package that includes a breakdown of the
      following items by OS/AMU:
      3.2.1.6. Utilization (UTE).
         3.2.1.6.1. Hourly UTE (HUTE) is the number of hours an aircraft must fly per month
         in order to meet the annual requirement. HUTE will be computed by month for the
         entire fiscal year for contracted (required) hours and scheduled hours. The HUTE is
         computed by Figure 3.1.

Figure 3.1. HUTE.



         3.2.1.6.2. Sortie UTE (SUTE) is the number of sorties an aircraft must fly per month
         in order to meet the annual requirement. SUTE will be computed by month for the
         entire fiscal year for contracted (required) sorties and scheduled sorties. The SUTE
         rate is computed by Figure 3.2.
AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013                                                                  11


Figure 3.2. SUTE.




             3.2.1.6.2.1. Aircraft Authorizations:
                 3.2.1.6.2.1.1. HQ USAF specifies the PMAI for each unit in the USAF
                 Programs Aerospace Vehicles and Flying Hours (PA).
                 3.2.1.6.2.1.2. Units projected to possess less aircraft than authorized may be
                 assigned a revised PMAI or Chargeable Aircraft Authorization (CHRG) for
                 UTE and flying hour computations. The CHRG will be displayed for each
                 applicable unit in allocation messages.
      3.2.1.7. Sorties contracted/scheduled per day. Sorties (hours) per day will be computed
      by month for each OS/AMU. Compute the number of sorties (hours) required per O&M
      day to meet the operational requirement using Figure 3.3.

Figure 3.3. Sorties Contracted/Scheduled Per Day.




      3.2.1.8. Monthly scheduled sorties. Compute monthly scheduled sortie requirements
      using Figure 3.4.:

Figure 3.4. Monthly Scheduled Sorties.




          3.2.1.8.1. For an example, see Figure 3.5.

Figure 3.5. Monthly Scheduled Sorties Example.




          3.2.1.8.2. Remember to round any part up to the next whole sortie.
      3.2.1.9. Phase inspection dock capability. MO/PS&D and MO/MDSA will compute and
      provide the phase dock capability projection. This projection will be reviewed with
      AMXS and MXS supervision. Compute dock capability using the formula:

Figure 3.6. Phase Dock Capability Projection.
 12                                                          AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013


           3.2.1.9.1. For an example, see Figure 3.7.

Figure 3.7. Phase Dock Capability Projection Example.




           3.2.1.9.2. This number correlates to how many airframe inspection hours
           maintenance can support in a given month.
       3.2.1.10. NLT 30 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the “Proposed FHP” message, MO
       PS&D and OSS/OSO will co-chair a proposed FHP meeting with all required agencies.
       Agencies will include but are not limited to AMXS, MXS, MUNS, MSG (e.g., Fuels) and
       OS. Capability studies and operational requirements will be discussed and reviewed. Any
       maintenance, operational, or support shortfall will be noted and briefed to the MXG, OG
       and MSG CCs.
           3.2.1.10.1. MO PS&D and OSS/OSO will compile the airframe, personnel, and
           facility capability studies, operational requirements (paragraph 3.2.1.4), and any
           noted shortfall. A package will be prepared and briefed to group commanders
           (MXG/OG/MSG) prior to the WG/CC’s final approval. Once approved, the OG and
           MXG will provide 8 AF/A3, and subsequently, AFGSC/A3 a coordinated “Proposed
           FHP” response message. AFGSC/A3 will forward the FHP message to ACC/A3T.
           The message will depict the operational requirements by month for the next fiscal
           year and provide an overall capability statement of the unit’s ability to meet the plan.
           Maintenance and operational shortfalls will be noted and explained.
           3.2.1.10.2. NLT 35 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the proposed FHP message,
           once compiled, packages will be presented to the MSG, OG and MXG/CCs (or
           equivalents) before being presented to the WG/CC for approval. MO PS&D will
           review the comprehensive package submitted to OSS Current Operations Flight
           operations scheduling section and provide feedback to AMU OIC/NCOIC,
           AMXS/CC/MOO and MXG/CC as required. Final assessments of maintenance
           capabilities to support the operations proposed FHP projections are then sent to
           ACC/A3TB and ACC/A4M (after prior coordination and approval from 8 AF/A3,
           AFGSC/A4 and AFGSC/A3). The proposed FHP response message is due to
           ACC/A3T NLT the proposed FHP message suspense date.
3.3. COMBAT AIR FORCES (CAF) Baseline Allocation Message. Once COMACC
approves a unit’s proposed FHP response, the CAF Baseline Allocation message will become the
contract. This message will be forwarded to the unit NLT 1 Sep each year and will be the basis
for the unit’s annual flying and maintenance planning process. Note: Except for emergencies or
HHQ tasking at year end (e.g., hurricane evacuations), UNIT FLYING HOUR PROGRAMS
WILL NOT BE OVERFLOWN WITHOUT PRIOR HHQ APPROVAL. Wing commanders
are not required to "zero out" their annual flying hour program at the end of the fiscal year. The
last flying day of the year should be planned and flown as a normal flying day and should not be
truncated solely because the annual flying hour contract has been satisfied.
AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013                                                                  13


3.4. Annual Maintenance Planning Cycle. The annual planning cycle develops the wings
maintenance and operation plan to support/sustain the FHP established by the CAF Baseline
Allocation message. MO PS&D and OSS/OSO will lead the development of their wing’s annual
plan. Both maintenance and operations are required to refine their requirements and re-evaluate
their capability to support the FHP. It is critical all factors are considered and operational
requirements are balanced with maintenance capability throughout the year. MO/PS&D will
identify all major maintenance impacting airframe availability using IMDS products, such as
Time Distribution Index (TDI), Planning Requirements (PRA), and Workable TCTO Report
(WTR) background products to determine long-range maintenance requirements. MO/PS&D and
MDSA will validate all capability studies. OSS/OSO will validate their requirements and O&M
days.
   3.4.1. Developing the Annual Plan: MO/PS&D and OSS/OSO will ensure the annual
   planning process is initiated NLT 15 March and their Final Flying Hour Program (proposed
   FHP response) message will be submitted through 8 AF/A3 and AFGSC/A3 to
   ACC/A3T/A4M NLT the proposed FHP message suspense date. Units will ensure the
   following steps prior to submitting their final FHP (Annual plan).
   3.4.2. MO/PS&D and MO/MDSA will build and validate all capability studies which
   include: airframe, personnel, facility and phase dock projections. The studies will be
   reviewed and analyzed with AMXS and MXS supervision. Capability shortfalls will be noted
   and briefed to the MXG/CC.
       3.4.2.1. MO/MDSA will provide updated attrition factors to MO PS&D and OSS/OSO.
       3.4.2.2. MO/PS&D will provide all known major maintenance which includes but is not
       limited to: Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM), phase, refurbishment, and major
       modification schedules.
       3.4.2.3. MO PS&D will calculate and provide an average aircraft availability per month.
       3.4.2.4. OSS/OSO will validate their monthly breakdown of hours and sorties (based on
       RAP/contingency/curriculum requirements) in the baseline allocation message and
       provide maintenance the following planning factors:
          3.4.2.4.1. TDYs, if known
          3.4.2.4.2. Exercises, if known
          3.4.2.4.3. Safety, training, UTE, family, and all non-O&M days.
          3.4.2.4.4. O&M days.
          3.4.2.4.5. Sorties/hours/UTE rate required (programmed). Yearly requirement broken
          out by month. Note: UTE is a measure of performance and a key metric for success.
          3.4.2.4.6. Sorties/hours Scheduled (programmed + attrition). Yearly requirement
          broken out by month.
          3.4.2.4.7. Average sorties per O&M day.
          3.4.2.4.8. Suggested turn pattern.
          3.4.2.4.9. Configuration/munition requirements.

   3.4.3. NLT 15 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the Proposed FHP message, MO/PS&D
   and OSS/OSO will chair an annual planning meeting with all required agencies. Agencies
   will include but are not limited to AMXS, MXS, MUNS, OS and MSG (e.g., Fuels
   servicing). Capability studies, operational requirements and planning factors will be reviewed
   and validated during this meeting. Maintenance and operational shortfalls will be noted and
   briefed to the MXG/CC and OG/CC.
   3.4.4. NLT 30 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the Proposed FHP message, MO/PS&D
   and OSS/OSO will prepare and brief the wing’s annual maintenance and flying hour program
   to the group commanders (MXG/OG/MSG) prior to WG/CC approval. Once WG/CC
   approved, the OG and MXG will provide through 8 AF/A3 and by AFGSC/A3 to
   ACC/A3T/A4M a coordinated final FHP message. The message will depict the operational
   requirements by month for the next fiscal year and provide an overall capability statement of
   the unit’s ability to meet the plan. Note: If maintenance or operational capability does not
   exist to meet peacetime operational requirements due to split peacetime/AEF operations, or if
   an operational event impacts a unit’s ability to execute, the unit has the option to revise their
   FHP. This can be accomplished when submitting their annual plan or they can reflow
   sorties/hours quarterly, as required. Changes to the total hours/sorties on the CAF baseline
   allocation message require justification by the unit.
3.5. Quarterly Scheduling:
   3.5.1. Quarterly scheduling starts with the operational requirement for flying hours, UTE,
   airframe availability, alert, and other scheduling related data. The OS Director of Operations
   will provide these requirements to the AMU OIC/NCOIC, MUNS Control/Munitions OIC
   and PS&D NLT the first weekly scheduling meeting the month prior to the effective quarter.
   AMU supervision and the OS Director of Operations officer discuss these requirements at the
   scheduling meeting before the quarter being scheduled. Launch/recovery blocks, sortie flow
   timing, etc., are established based on training ranges (TR) and air refueling (AR) allocations.
   3.5.2. Schedulers ensure quarterly plans are as detailed and accurate as possible at the time
   of preparation. Include known special missions, depot maintenance input and output
   schedules, higher headquarters commitments, and lateral command support requirements.
      3.5.2.1. Use the following priority to determine which objectives to support if a lack of
      resources prevents meeting requirements:
          3.5.2.1.1. Alert commitments.
          3.5.2.1.2. Higher Headquarters directed missions.
          3.5.2.1.3. Training.
   3.5.3. The OG/CC and MXG/CC will jointly chair a quarterly meeting (i.e., Oct - Dec, Jan -
   Mar, Apr - Jun, Jul - Sep) NLT the monthly meeting prior to the effective quarter. Quarterly
   meeting may be held in conjunction with monthly meeting. A rolling 3-month plan briefed
   each month meets the intent of the quarterly scheduling process. OSS/OSO compiles,
   coordinates, and briefs the quarterly plan to include operational requirements, support
   capability, and difficulties expected. This meeting may be held in conjunction with the
   weekly scheduling meeting or as a separate scheduling meeting. Once an approved quarterly
   plan is established, OSS/OSO will forward a copy to OS, AMXS, MO, OG/CC, and
AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013                                                                   15


   MXG/CC along with all scheduling agencies. The plan will be posted so it may be viewed by
   both maintenance and operations. When changes to the quarterly plan are required to achieve
   the unit objectives, make necessary adjustments to the monthly and weekly plans while
   keeping within unit capabilities.
3.6. Monthly Scheduling:
   3.6.1. Monthly plans refine quarterly requirements. Forecast and monitor requirements for
   the current and next 2 months. Include predictable maintenance factors based on historical
   data along with other inputs, such as flow times for maintenance, all known operational
   events (e.g., exercises, deployments, and surges) to determine maintenance capability to meet
   operational requirements.
      3.6.1.1. Long-range maintenance plans will be developed in as much detail as possible.
      All maintenance requirements will be consolidated into a single long-range plan using AF
      Form 2401, Equipment Utilization and Maintenance Schedule, or computer generated
      form. As a minimum, the long-range plan will show the current month and the next 2
      months’ known flying and maintenance requirements. Known maintenance requirements
      are defined as any maintenance event that impacts aircraft availability and maintenance
      events requiring management attention to ensure smooth flow of scheduling/completion.
      Maintenance events should be consolidated during a single down period to the
      greatest extent possible. As a minimum, include calendar inspections that prevent
      operational utilization for that day(s) flying schedule, calendar time change items,
      TCTOs in workable status, PDM schedules, training aircraft, cannibalization aircraft, and
      aircraft phase inspections. Specific locally-developed codes may be used to identify each
      different special inspection, TCI, and TCTO on the AF Form 2401. Other maintenance
      requirements, such as engine changes, hourly requirements, inspections, training aircraft
      and cannibalization aircraft will be posted as they become known or planned. Refine
      monthly and weekly schedules to ensure the quarterly plan objectives are met.
   3.6.2. The OS Director of Operations officers and AMU OIC/NCOIC will review their
   applicable portion of the monthly schedule prior to submission to MO PS&D. To optimize
   aircraft and munitions support, MXS, AMXS and OS commanders will ensure the number of
   aircraft committed to the schedule and/or munitions configurations are minimized and
   standardized. Use the following sequence of actions to ensure monthly planning results in a
   contracted flying schedule. The monthly planning process is as follows:
      3.6.2.1. NLT the first weekly OG/MXG scheduling meeting of the month, the Director
      of Operations officer will provide AMU OIC/NCOIC, MUNS Control/Munitions OIC
      and MO PS&D with the estimated operational needs for the following month in as much
      detail as possible. Include known take-off times, landing times, the flying hour window
      and munitions configurations. If the take-off and landing times are unknown, block turn
      patterns are required.
      3.6.2.2. NLT the second weekly OG/MXG scheduling meeting of the month, the AMU
      OIC/NCOIC will tell the Director of Operations officer whether requirements can be met
      or limitations exist which may prevent successful fulfillment of requirements. MUNS
      Control/ Munitions OIC will tell the Director of Operations officer whether munitions
      requirements can be met or limitations exist. Make adjustments to the proposed monthly
      flying and maintenance plan to satisfy maintenance and operational requirements.

     3.6.2.3. NLT the third weekly OG/MXG scheduling meeting of the month, operations
     and maintenance will formalize next month’s plan prior to presenting it to the WG/CC for
     approval.
  3.6.3. During the monthly meeting, OS scheduling will outline past accomplishments, status
  of flying goals, problems encountered, and detailed needs for the next month.
     3.6.3.1. AMU/AMXS will outline projected maintenance capability, and
     aircraft/equipment availability. MUNS control NCOIC/Munitions officer outlines
     projected munitions supportability.
     3.6.3.2. Operational requirements and maintenance capability scheduling conflicts that
     cannot be solved by planned alternatives will be arbitrated by the group and wing
     commanders to decide what portion of the schedule will be executed.
  3.6.4. When the proposed monthly flying schedule contract is agreed upon and approved by
  the WG/CC, it is included as a portion of the monthly flying and maintenance schedule. The
  monthly flying and maintenance schedule is published/distributed NLT 5 duty days prior to
  the beginning of the effective month. All agencies will submit their monthly plan inputs to
  MO PS&D before presentation to the WG/CC.
  3.6.5. The sortie/flying hour contract specifies the number of sorties and hours required to be
  flown. The contract is the final resolved product between operational requirements and
  maintenance capabilities. The total forecasted attrition factor will be considered and added to
  the required sorties to ensure fulfillment of the contract. The annual required sorties for the
  month, plus the historical attrition factor (note paragraph 8.1: MXG approved revised
  attrition is also permitted), is the basis for the development of the monthly flying and
  maintenance schedules. Attrition sorties are not substitutes for capability shortfalls; they are
  figured against the contract. The monthly flying schedule will reflect the number of sorties
  contracted, the number of attrition sorties added, and the number of sorties scheduled for
  each unit. Note: The calendar in Table 3.1 is an example month and represents when group
  and wing level quarterly, monthly, and weekly scheduling meetings should be held. The
  calendar also illustrates when maintenance and operations requirements must be met. Each
  unit may hold scheduling meetings at times during the week/month convenient to the
  organization, as long as the timelines in this instruction are met.
  3.6.6. Included in the monthly flying and maintenance schedule are:
     3.6.6.1. A detailed monthly operations utilization calendar which specifies total aircraft
     flying hours, total sorties and missions, alert requirements, and scheduled sortie or
     mission requirements, daily turn plans for each MDS by squadron, group, or wing.
     3.6.6.2. Maintenance workload requirements.
     3.6.6.3. Transient work schedule, if applicable.
     3.6.6.4. Aircraft scheduled inspections, deployments, TCTOs, engine changes, time
     changes, contract or depot maintenance, washes, corrosion control, training aircraft, and
     alert commitments. The letter "F" (F2, F3, etc…) may be printed on the AF Form 2401 or
     automated product to reflect the number of sorties each aircraft is scheduled to fly and to
     facilitate TDI/Phase management. As a minimum, automated forms must reflect all
     required entries and standardized for each MDS.
AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013                                                                     17


      3.6.6.5. Support equipment (SE) scheduled inspections, contract or depot maintenance,
      TCTOs, time changes, washes, and corrosion control.
      3.6.6.6. Engine Management schedules to include engine in shop inspections,
      maintenance needs, special inspections, TCIs and TCTOs.
      3.6.6.7. Munitions, electronic countermeasures and other mission loading or
      configuration requirements, including ammunition changes.
      3.6.6.8. Total ordnance requirements for aircraft support listed by quantity and type.
      Include the following statement in the schedule for units with munitions: "The types and
      quantities of munitions listed in this schedule, plus previous expenditures, do not exceed
      AFI 11-212, Munitions Requirements for Aircrew Training, authorized allowances." This
      statement eliminates the need for submitting certificates of authorization when ordering
      munitions to support the flying schedule.
      3.6.6.9. Tanks, racks, adapters, and pylons and war reserve materiel scheduled
      inspections, TCTOs, assembly, or repair operations.
      3.6.6.10. Quality Assurance (QA) scheduled inspections listed by type and quantity
      unless published separately by QA.
      3.6.6.11. Monthly training schedules, if not published separately.
      3.6.6.12. Detailed support requirements, as applicable, including:
         3.6.6.12.1. Petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) servicing.
         3.6.6.12.2. Supply requirements.
         3.6.6.12.3. Food service requirements.
         3.6.6.12.4. Fire department requirements.
         3.6.6.12.5. Security requirements.
         3.6.6.12.6. Civil engineer requirements.
         3.6.6.12.7. Airfield operations requirements.

3.7. Weekly Scheduling:
     3.7.1. Weekly scheduling is the final refinement to the monthly plan and results in the
     weekly flying and maintenance schedule. Its execution is measured by the procedures
     outlined in this instruction. The OS Director of Operations officer, AMU OIC/NCOIC, and
     AMXS Maintenance Operations review the proposed weekly flying and maintenance
     schedule with OS, AMXS, MXS and MUNS Control/Munitions officer prior to presenting it
     to the OG and MXG commanders. The group approved schedule will be submitted to the MO
     PS&D for consolidation prior to submission to the wing commander. MO PS&D reviews the
     schedules for adequate utilization of aircraft and proper scheduling of maintenance
     requirements. Weekly scheduling meetings will be conducted at the group and wing level as
     follows:
        3.7.1.1. The OG/CC and MXG/CC, or their designated representatives, will chair the
        group meeting to consolidate and review proposed flying and maintenance plans. The OG
        and MXG will review the past week's accomplishments, negotiate alternatives, and
        approve refinements to the coming week's schedule.
        3.7.1.2. The WG/CC will chair a weekly scheduling meeting at which the groups
        (OG/MXG/MSG) will present the flying and maintenance plan for approval. MO PS&D
        ensures a completed (paper or electronic) copy is submitted to the WG/CC (or
        equivalent) at the weekly scheduling meeting.
            3.7.1.2.1. At the scheduling meeting, evaluate the past week’s accomplishments, to
            include Flying and Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness, and refinements to the
            coming week's schedule.
     3.7.2. NLT 2 duty days before the OPS/AMU weekly scheduling meeting, the flying
     squadron operations officer gives the AMU OIC/NCOIC, MO PS&D, MXS maintenance
     operations and MUNS Control/Munitions Officer the following information:
        3.7.2.1. Aircraft take-off and landing times.
        3.7.2.2. Configuration requirements.
20                                                        AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013


     3.7.2.3. Munitions requirements by quantity and type.
     3.7.2.4. Fuel loads.
     3.7.2.5. Special or peculiar mission support requirements.
     3.7.2.6. Alert requirements.
     3.7.2.7. Exercise vulnerability.
     3.7.2.8. Deployments.
     3.7.2.9. Off base sorties.
     3.7.2.10. On-equipment training requirements.
     3.7.2.11. Other special requirements.
     3.7.2.12. Nuclear munitions maintenance schedule. Note: When one maintenance unit
     supports more than one flying unit at a base, the OS Directors of Operations will
     consolidate and de-conflict those requirements and submit a single operational
     requirement to maintenance. This will ensure operational requirements do not exceed
     aircraft availability and maintenance capability.
  3.7.3. Operations and maintenance schedulers discuss weekly needs and arrive at an
  acceptable, coordinated schedule for group commanders' review. Note: Closely monitor the
  flying window. The window drives shift scheduling but be aware, operations and
  maintenance are not the only agencies involved in sortie generation. Petroleum, Oils, and
  Lubricants (POL); Air Traffic Control (ATC); Weather (WX) and many others will assist in
  the effort. Supervision must cover the entire flying window and then some. The length of the
  flying window determines the effectiveness of maintenance repair shift. Turbulence in the
  flying window equals stress on the flight line--keep it consistent throughout the week.
  Combining a late start today with an early start tomorrow hurts! It compresses/shortens the
  maintenance repair/generation window. Note: Ensure maintenance schedulers are flowing
  aircraft -6 maintenance inspections, commodity TO/workcards, time changes, and Time
  Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) requirements as smoothly as possible to maximize
  aircraft availability and reduce excessive maintenance downtime.
  3.7.4. OG/CC and MXG/CC present the proposed flying schedule to the WG/CC for
  approval. If an agreement cannot be reached before the weekly scheduling meeting, the
  problem is referred to the WG/CC for decision. Once approved and signed by the WG/CC,
  OG/CC, and MXG/CC, the flying schedule is the final planning guide for both operations
  and maintenance and is a contract and every effort will be made to execute the schedule as
  printed.
  3.7.5. MO PS&D ensures distribution of the schedule to each appropriate activity and
  workcenter NLT 1200L Friday morning. Units conducting night flying operations should
  distribute the schedule as soon as possible but NLT 1400L Friday. Automated methods are
  acceptable (ensure security requirements are met). Once printed in the weekly flying and
  maintenance schedule, the aircraft or equipment is made available to meet that schedule. MO
  PS&D records maintenance scheduling deviations and forwards computations to MDSA
  weekly for publication in the monthly maintenance summary as outlined in Chapter 5. The
  maintenance operations center (MOC) reports flying scheduling deviations.
AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013                                                                    21


   3.7.6. Units will publish a weekly schedule for normal home base operations, deployments,
   (to include a printed schedule at the deployed locations, weapons training or detached site),
   and planned sortie surges. Deployed units will send weekly schedules to home station for
   historical filing within three duty days of the following week. Units operating by daily ATOs
   will publish a schedule IAW paragraph 3.7 and 4.7 and file it as a weekly schedule after
   execution. Included in the weekly flying and maintenance schedule are:
      3.7.6.1. Sortie sequence numbers, aircraft tail numbers (primary and spares), scheduled
      take-off and landing times, aircraft or equipment scheduled use times, configurations,
      fuel loads and special equipment requirements. Note: Units will publish landing times.
      3.7.6.2. Spare aircraft requirements are based on projected aircraft first sortie logistics
      losses. Spare requirements are computed and printed by day for each unit in the weekly
      flying and maintenance schedule. See Chapter 8 for factors used to determine spares.
      3.7.6.3. Scheduled maintenance actions by aircraft and equipment serial number to
      include inspections, TCTOs, time changes, contract and depot inputs, engine changes,
      washes or corrosion control, documents review, deferred discrepancies and hours
      remaining to phase. A job control number/event ID will be printed in the weekly flying
      schedule for each scheduled maintenance event.
      3.7.6.4. Required pre-inspection and other maintenance meeting schedules to include
      minimum attendees.
      3.7.6.5. Wash facility use.
      3.7.6.6. Training requirements plus aircraft and equipment in support of these
      requirements.
      3.7.6.7. Aerospace Ground Equipment inspection/maintenance schedule by type, serial
      number or identification.
      3.7.6.8. Include the following statement in the schedule for units with munitions: "The
      types and quantities of munitions listed in this schedule, plus previous expenditures, do
      not exceed AFI 11-212 authorized allowances." This statement eliminates the need for
      submitting certificates of authorization when ordering munitions to support the flying
      schedule.
      3.7.6.9. A list of new or revised publications, T.O. indexes, inspection work cards,
      checklists and -6 codebooks, including release/change dates. Automated systems will be
      used, if available. Note: The AF Form 2402, Weekly Equipment Utilization and
      Maintenance Schedule, is used as a summary of the week. The AF Form 2403, Weekly
      Aircraft Utilization/Maintenance Schedule, is more finite in the depiction of aircraft
      utilization and maintenance. Electronic versions of the above forms are authorized.
      Whatever forms are used, all requirements must be entered. Weekly schedules may be
      published electronically provided local security requirements are met.
3.8. Changes to the Weekly Schedule:
   3.8.1. Types:
      3.8.1.1. Pen-and-Ink changes. The pen-and-ink AF Form 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying
      Schedule Coordination, is not intended to be used as a tool to extend the scheduling
22                                                         AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013


     process by another day. Pen-and-ink changes made to next week’s schedule, submitted
     to the MOC by 1600 hours Friday or at the daily maintenance scheduling/production
     meeting, whichever occurs first are authorized (exception: NLT 2 hours after the last
     landing during printed night flying weeks). They are non-reportable and become part of
     the printed weekly flying and maintenance schedule. An AF Form 2407 or electronic
     substitution is required stating the changes are pen-and-ink. Note: The intent of the pen-
     and-ink AF Form 2407 is to correct minor errors and not complete revisions of the
     previously Wing/CC approved schedule. Note: Add aircraft to the schedule in close
     coordination between OG and MXG leadership. Adds should be approached cautiously
     with the understanding that underlying effects may be masked and adds generally create a
     domino effect to future flying and maintenance activity.
         3.8.1.1.1. Unit Training Assembly (UTA) Weekends. During scheduled UTA
         weekend flying for classic Association units are allowed to accomplish pen-and-inks
         on the last scheduled fly-day (Saturday or Sunday). Approved pen-and-ink changes
         will be made to next week’s schedule prior to 1600 hours local or 2 hours after the
         last landing during scheduled/published night flying.
     3.8.1.2. Tail Number Swaps. Tail number swaps should be used to prevent
     reconfigurations and unnecessary expenditures of work hours when the primary aircraft is
     not mission-capable by its scheduled take-off time. Every effort is made to make the
     aircraft tail number swaps at the daily maintenance production meeting the day prior to
     the aircraft scheduled flight and entered on the AF Form 2407. All tail number swaps
     made at the daily maintenance production meeting are entered on an AF Form 2407 for
     audit and analysis purposes.
     3.8.1.3. Configuration. Configurations will be finalized at the daily maintenance
     production meeting and documented on an AF Form 2407. To prevent excessive
     expenditures of work hours, configuration changes made after the daily maintenance
     production meeting and prior to the first crew ready time the next day, require an AF
     Form 2407 coordinated through the required agencies as listed in 3.8.2.4.
  3.8.2. Procedures. The initiator of AF Form 2407 will include the specific reason for each
  change. Any change to the printed schedule will require an AF Form 2407 with the
  following exceptions:
     3.8.2.1. A change to the original printed take-off or landing time of 15 minutes or less.
     3.8.2.2. A change of aircrew names, ranges, or airspace.
     3.8.2.3. Any change arising after the first crew ready time for the affected AMU for that
     day unless adding aircraft or sorties, or expanding the flying window.
     3.8.2.4. Changes made during the daily maintenance production meeting also require an
     AF Form 2407. The agency requesting the change initiates the AF Form 2407 and
     coordinates it through the affected production superintendent, AMU OIC/NCOIC,
     AMXS maintenance operations, OS director of operations officer, operations group,
     munitions control, maintenance group, and wing staff agencies, as applicable (e.g., MOC,
     PS&D, etc..). Coordinate changes affecting munitions requirements with Munitions
     Control to ensure proposed munitions changes can be met. The requested changes should
AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013                                                                   23


     be coordinated prior to the daily maintenance production meeting to allow sufficient time
     to determine supportability of the change.
     3.8.2.5. Changes arising after the first crew ready time for the remainder of the flying
     day, such as tail number swaps, do not require an AF Form 2407; however, these changes
     will be coordinated by telephone or radio with all affected agencies. EXCEPTION: Any
     aircraft, sortie added to the flying schedule and any sortie duration changes that
     extends flying or landing beyond the flying hour window will be coordinated using
     an AF Form 2407.
     3.8.2.6. After coordination, a copy of the AF Form 2407 is filed in the MOC and in
     PS&D with the weekly schedule. AF Forms 2407 will be disposed of IAW RDS.
     3.8.2.7. MO PS&D will input all pen-and-ink changes in IMDS operational events
     subsystem using procedures in AFCSM 21-565V2, Operational Event Subsystem. After
     the Friday daily maintenance production meeting, MOC will input all changes (non-pen-
     and-ink). Maintenance debrief will input utilization data for all sorties considered "flown
     as scheduled" (e.g., FCF/OCF, X/C returns, surge, second and subsequent goes). MOC
     will input any AF Form 2407 coordinated changes made after pen-and-inks have been
     made and posted to IMDS by MO PS&D into the Maintenance Information System
     (MIS).
  3.8.2.8. MDSA will review all AF Form 2407s daily for deviation accounting. Note: Use of
  the AF Form 2407 does not negate the recording of deviations.
  3.8.3. AF Form 2407 Approval Authority. Both OG and MXG commanders (or group
  level representative, designated in writing by group commander) will approve all AF Form
  2407 changes that add aircraft and/or sorties or increase the flying window. Squadron
  commander(s) (or designated representative) will approve all other AF Form 2407 changes
  that affect them. The MOC will coordinate higher headquarters directed taskings that require
  immediate execution. Electronic coordination is acceptable provided receipt is acknowledged
  and the sender enters the name of the person notified and the date/time on the AF Form 2407.
     3.8.3.1. OG and MXG commanders will also approve pen-and-ink AF Form 2407s. The
     group approved pen-and-ink AF Form 2407 is required because pen-and-ink AF Form
     2407 change the schedule/contract signed at the weekly scheduling meeting and becomes
     the new basis for deviation recording.
     3.8.3.2. Wings will establish a standardized written approval authority for AF Form
     2407, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination, scheduling changes.

                                           Chapter 4

                        FLYING SCHEDULING EFFECTIVENESS

4.1. Purpose. This chapter defines flying schedule deviations and provides formulas for
computing FSE. FSE is a tool to identify those processes within the wing’s control that can be
improved to help drive down turbulence for both the operator and maintainer.
   4.1.1. A cornerstone of successful flying scheduling and execution is an understanding of
   how the schedule is executed versus how it was planned to be executed. These differences in
   scheduled versus actual events are only recorded in the execution phase of the scheduling
   process and are called deviations. Deviation data must be recorded so that follow-up analysis
   can identify the appropriate corrective actions if any are needed. Without deviation data, this
   analysis is impossible. Deviation data recording and analysis is the beginning of the process
   that will in the end, improve unit's flying operations. The unit is responsible for documenting
   deviations to the weekly flying and maintenance schedule and determining the cause for each
   deviation. Deviations must be coordinated with the appropriate squadron/AMU before being
   assigned to a specific category. Schedule deviations that result from a sequence of events will
   be assigned a primary cause. A determination of the primary cause will be made by the
   parties involved to arrive at a unit position. The OS Director of Operations officer and the
   AMU OIC/AMXS maintenance operations, along with MO maintenance operations, will
   monitor deviations to ensure they meet the criteria in this publication. When conflicts arise,
   leadership of involved units will resolve them at the lowest level. All deviations will be
   recorded as described in this publication.
   4.1.2. Flying Scheduling Effectiveness (FSE). This leading indicator is a measure of how
   well the unit planned and executed the weekly flying schedule. The flying schedule
   developed by tail number is the baseline upon which the FSE is derived by comparing each
   day’s deviations. Deviations that decrease the FSE from 100% include: scheduled sorties not
   flown because of maintenance, supply, operations adds, deletes, and ground aborts;
   scheduled sorties that take-off more than 30 minutes prior to scheduled take-off; and
   scheduled sorties that take-off more than 30 minutes after their scheduled take-off time.
   Disruptions to the flying schedule can cause turmoil on the flight line, send a ripple effect
   throughout other agencies, and adversely impact scheduled maintenance actions. The
   adjusted sorties scheduled can be computed by using the following formula: Total Sorties
   Scheduled - Sorties Cancelled for Monthly/Yearly Utilization Rate Achievement + Sorties
   Added for End of Fiscal Year UTE Close Out]. Refer to AFGSCI 21-118, Logistics
   Maintenance Performance Indicator Reporting Procedures, for FSE computations.
4.2. Requirements. Flying scheduling effectiveness computation and deviation recording are
required for all AFGSC assigned aircraft. Reporting procedures are contained in Chapter 7 of
this publication.
4.3. Flying Schedule Deviations.
   4.3.1. Schedule deviations apply to the printed weekly flying and maintenance schedule,
   even though a coordinated change is accomplished using an AF Form 2407. When a unit
   coordinates a change to the printed weekly flying schedule, using an AF Form 2407, the unit
   is informing everyone of the changed information and deviations will be recorded as
AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013                                                                      25


  appropriate. Multiple deviations against a single line entry will not count towards FSE
  except for (a) additions that air or ground abort, (b)additions that cancel, (c) added
  aircraft/sorties that take-off late, and (d) late take-offs that air abort. The AFTO Form
  781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, is the official source document for take-
  off and landing data. For all deviations, MOC or debriefing personnel recording the
  deviations in IMDS will provide a detailed explanation in the remarks section and a
  maintenance        event     ID       using      IMDS        TRIC       DEV,       Deviation
  Start/Stop/Correction/Abort/Delete, for all maintenance cancellations, ground/air aborts, and
  in-flight emergencies. Flying schedule deviations fall into one of the following categories
  (See Table 4.1 for common deviations):
  4.3.2. Ground Deviations. Ground deviations are events occurring before aircraft take-off.
  All ground deviations are recorded in IMDS and used in flying scheduling effectiveness
  calculations unless otherwise noted. Specific ground deviations are:
     4.3.2.1. Addition (AD). A sortie or aircraft added to the schedule not previously printed
     on the weekly schedule, will be recorded against the agency (OP, MX, HQ) requesting
     the additional sortie or aircraft. Sorties added to the schedule will be used in Total Sorties
     Scheduled for Flying Scheduling Effectiveness computation. Aircraft added to the
     schedule will not be used as a part of the Total Sorties Scheduled for Flying Scheduling
     Effectiveness computation; however, aircraft adds (e.g. added spares) will be captured in
     the FSE calculated-deviations computation.
         4.3.2.1.1. Functional Check Flights (FCF) or Operational Check Flights (OCF)
         whose primary purpose is to perform maintenance checks are not addition deviations
         but will be coordinated using AF Form 2407. FCF/OCF sorties and sorties originating
         off-station without home-unit support will be considered "flown as scheduled”
         without recording deviations. Note: All additions will be coordinated using the AF
         Form 2407 and approved IAW paragraph 3.8.3
     4.3.2.2. Cancellation (CX). An aircraft or sortie removed from the printed schedule for
     any reason prior to crew show. For hard line sorties (sorties supporting other defense
     customers), cancellations occur when it is determined the originally scheduled
     mission cannot be met. For training sorties, if the sortie can launch and recover during
     the squadron’s flying window and perform its original mission, a cancellation is not
     recorded. If any sortie does not launch within the late take-off criteria, a late take-off is
     recorded.
     4.3.2.3. Early Take-off (ET). An early take-off is a scheduled sortie launching more than
     30 minutes prior to the published take-off time.
     4.3.2.4. Late Take-off (LT). A late take-off occurs when a scheduled sortie becomes
     airborne more than 30 minutes after the scheduled take-off time. If the printed tail
     number is a ground abort and is replaced with a spare that takes off late, only the late
     take-off is computed in FSE. Another example is an aircraft landing late and
     subsequently takes off late due to insufficient time to turn the aircraft; the late take-off
     deviation will then be recorded to the original cause of the late landing, such as,
     operations. Commanders must consider the impact when a sortie takes off late and the
     aircraft is scheduled to turn to another sortie that day. It may be best to shorten the sortie

     duration after a late take-off and land at the scheduled landing time, rather than fly the
     scheduled duration, due to a higher priority mission later in the day.
     4.3.2.5. Spare (SP). A spare is a designated aircraft on the printed schedule to be used in
     case a scheduled primary aircraft cannot fly its scheduled sortie. Spare aircraft can also
     include aircraft that are scheduled to fly in sorties later in the day, have aborted from an
     earlier sortie, have flown earlier or released after FCF/OCF. Do not count printed spares
     flown in scheduled lines as deviations when computing FSE.
     4.3.2.6. Tail Number Swap (TS). Tail swaps are changes to the printed flying schedule
     involving aircraft tail numbers printed on that day's schedule. Tail swaps may be made up
     to crew show time. Tail swaps made after crew show are recorded as spare. AMU
     production will notify MOC of all tail swaps and MOC will record all tail swaps in
     IMDS. Do not count tail number swaps as deviations when computing FSE. Below are
     specific examples of tail swaps:
         4.3.2.6.1. Changing aircraft in printed line numbers with printed spare aircraft.
         4.3.2.6.2. Changing aircraft in printed line numbers to different printed line numbers.
         4.3.2.6.3. Changing aircraft in printed line numbers to any previously flown aircraft.
         For example, tail swaps are allowed for aircraft after release from OCF/FCF or XC
         return aircraft.
  4.3.3. Air Deviations. Air deviations are events occurring after take-off. They are recorded
  in IMDS but are not included in FSE calculations. Ground deviations take precedence over
  air deviations when only one deviation can be loaded in IMDS. Air deviations fall into the
  following categories:
     4.3.3.1. Air Abort (AA). An air abort is an aircraft/sortie that cannot complete its mission
     for any reason. Air aborts are considered a sortie flown against the flying hour program
     when reporting total sorties flown, but may not be considered a successful sortie based on
     mission effectiveness by operations to meet RAP/training/contingency requirements. Air
     aborts will be coded to the agency or condition that caused the aborted mission. Note:
     Effective mission decisions will be made by operations; however, a non-effective mission
     decision by operations does not necessarily mean an air abort occurred as defined in
     AFGSCI 21-118. For example, if one planned mission task out of a planned five tasks is
     not completed or operations flies an alternate mission (close air support, reconnaissance,
     etc.) and does not return the aircraft immediately to maintenance, the sortie should not be
     coded as an air abort if operations later determines, based on the original mission profile,
     the sortie was non-effective. The air abort rate is used as a maintenance reliability
     indicator and as a measure of re-work (sorties reflown).
     4.3.3.2. Air Abort, IFE (AI). An air aborted aircraft/sortie with a situation resulting in an
     in-flight emergency declared by the aircrew.
     4.3.3.3. Early Landing (EL). An early landing is an aircraft/sortie landing more than 30
     minutes before the scheduled landing time. Early landings deviations are not used when
     computing FSE.
     4.3.3.4. IFE (FE). An aircraft/sortie with a situation resulting in an in-flight emergency
     declared by the aircrew after the mission is accomplished.
AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013                                                                        27


        4.3.3.5. Late Landing (LL). A late landing is an aircraft/sortie landing more than 30
        minutes after the scheduled landing time. If the sortie originated on time, record any
        subsequent late take-off or cancellation against the agency that caused the late landing. If
        the extended sortie did not originate on time, record any subsequent sortie deviation
        against the agency that caused the original delay. Late landings are not included in FSE
        calculations.
   4.3.4. Ground Aborts. A ground abort by itself is not a deviation from the flying schedule,
   but can cause a deviation such as lost sortie or late take-off. A ground abort is an event after
   crew show time preventing a “crew ready” aircraft from becoming airborne. Ground aborts
   will be recorded to the responsible agency or condition that caused the aircraft to abort.
   Ground aborts are categorized as GAA, GAB, GAC, operations, HHQ, weather, sympathy,
   other, etc. For maintenance ground aborts, do not use cause code MTx, only use GAA, GAB,
   or GAC. For example, if an aircraft ground aborts and the sortie is not replaced by a spare,
   the lost sortie is a deviation towards FSE. Ground aborts on FCFs or OCFs will not be used
   when computing FSE, but will be recorded in IMDS.
        4.3.4.1. If a ground aborted aircraft is replaced by a spare, and the spare can meet the
        mission requirements, the original aircraft will be coded as a “spare ground abort.”
        Note: This is not used in computing FSE.
        4.3.4.2. If the original aborted aircraft is launched on the original scheduled mission, but
        exceeds the 30-minute late take-off criteria, the sortie will be recorded as a late take-off.
        4.3.4.3. If an aircraft ground aborts and is replaced by a spare; and the spare ground
        abort causes the sortie not to be flown; both ground aborts will be counted in the overall
        ground abort rate; and the lost sortie will be considered cancelled and included as the
        deviation in FSE. The first ground abort would not be used in computing FSE.

4.4. Deviation Causes. Deviations will be assigned a primary cause. See guidance in paragraph
4.1.1 to resolve questions concerning assigning deviations between maintenance and operations.
Deviations will be assigned one of the following causes:
   4.4.1. Maintenance (MT_). Deviations resulting from aircraft discrepancies, unscheduled
   maintenance, or for actions taken for maintenance consideration.
   4.4.2. Operations (OP_). Deviations resulting from operations/aircrew actions, mission
   changes causing an early/late take-off, or cancellation including substitution/aircrew illness
   (including short notice aircrew physical/mental disqualification), and over-stressing the
   aircraft. OP_ are also deviations resulting from unit controlled operations factors including
   those caused by mission/load planning, life support, intelligence, base operations, range
   scheduling, and passengers.
   4.4.3. Supply (SU_). Deviations resulting from a Partially Mission Capable Supply or Not
   Mission Capable Supply condition as well as for late Supply or POL delivery. See AFMAN
   23-110, USAF Supply Manual. Note: The actual time required for installation will be
   considered.
   4.4.4. Higher Headquarters (HHQ). Deviations resulting from a higher headquarters tasking
   including closing of low level routes/ranges or external customer-driven mission change.
   When an aircraft that was scheduled for a higher headquarters directed alert or off-base
   mission is replaced by a spare refer to paragraph 6.5 for unit options.
   4.4.5. Weather (WX_). Deviations resulting from weather conditions such as sorties
   canceled because of severe weather conditions. For example, if an aircraft taxied to the end
   of runway and the wing commander cancels all flying due to weather, the deviation is a
   weather abort. Sorties/aircraft cancelled prior to crew show are weather cancels.
   4.4.6. Sympathy (SY_). Deviations occurring when a flight of two or more aircraft, under
   the command of a flight leader or instructor pilot are canceled, aborted, or late due to a
   cancellation, abort, or delay of one of the aircraft in the flight or a supporting flight. Sorties,
   which are to replace sympathy aborts or cancellations on the same day, will be recorded as
   sympathy additions. Sorties lost caused by the aircraft's scheduled mated
   tanker/receiver/mission event will be recorded as sympathy. Examples of mission events are:
   loss of release times, tanker support, Minimum Interval Take-Off causing take-off delay or
   cancellation, deviations caused by another unit’s or command’s support should be coded as
   SY deviations. Note: Deviations caused by aircraft/missions earlier scheduled lines will be
   assigned to the cause of the earlier deviation, not SY.
   4.4.7. Air Traffic Control (AT_). Deviations resulting from air traffic control problems (for
   example, flight clearance delays, tower communication failure, conflicting air traffic, runway
   change, or runway closure).
   4.4.8. Other (OT_). Deviations resulting from unusual circumstances not covered by other
   causes listed. OT may include:
       4.4.8.1. Malfunctions, failures, or necessary adjustments to equipment undergoing tests
       or evaluations.
       4.4.8.2. Unusual circumstances such as bird strikes, damage during air refueling, and
       unscheduled alert swap out.

      4.4.8.3. Equipment, non-AFGSC. Deviations caused by National Airborne Operations
      Center or Air Intelligence Agency or Air Force Material Command equipment, and other
      non-AFGSC support and equipment.
   4.4.9. Utilization day (UTE). Commander's authorized management deletions IAW
   paragraph 4.5.3
   4.4.10. Exercise, Higher Headquarters (XEH). Deviations resulting from higher headquarters
   directed exercises, including alarm/force protection conditions.
   4.4.11. Exercise, Local (XEL). Deviations resulting from wing/unit directed exercises,
   including alarm/force protection conditions.
4.5. Scheduling Exceptions:
   4.5.1. Limited Number of Possessed Aircraft. AMUs with 50% of their possessed aircraft
   deployed, are authorized to schedule tail numbers daily. Units may consider alert/IR aircraft
   and aircraft in possession code PJ or PR as non-possessed when applying the 50% rule. Units
   will print aircraft tail numbers in the weekly schedule. Aircraft tail numbers may be changed
   at the daily maintenance production meeting using AF Form 2407 without recording
   deviations (sorties added or canceled are chargeable). Immediately following the daily
   maintenance production meeting, the selected aircraft tail numbers for the next day’s flying
   schedule will be entered in IMDS. Once tail numbers are selected at the daily maintenance
   production meeting, normal deviations will be recorded. Aircraft tail number changes will
   be chargeable against FSE after tail numbers are confirmed during the daily
   maintenance production meeting. Note: No additional sorties may be added under this
   scheduling option without addition deviation rules being applied as applicable in paragraph
   4.3.2.1
   4.5.2. Adverse Weather. Units may add sorties to the flying schedule to make up for
   weather losses. Sorties will only be added to the schedule when the planned weather attrition
   for the month, prorated daily, has been exceeded for that month. The number of sorties added
   will not exceed the difference between the planned weather attrition and actual weather
   losses. Sorties added for weather that do not exceed prorated weather attrition, are not
   included in the OPS-MT-FSE-Rate. (EXAMPLE: Planned weather attrition for the month
   equals 30 sorties on the 10th O&M day of the month (of 20 O&M days of the month), then
   the unit may add no more than 15 sorties as (weather adds). The maintenance schedule and
   the ability of maintenance to support the additional requirements must be carefully
   considered before adding sorties. Under no circumstances will the number of sorties added
   for weather exceed the difference between actual weather losses and the prorated expected
   weather losses for the month. (See Chapter 8 for example of computing weather attrition for
   the flying schedule.)
   4.5.3. Achievement of Utilization (UTE). Utilization management is accomplished
   throughout the month. Attrition should be closely monitored and a determination to adjust the
   number of sorties required should be made before each weekly schedule is developed. This
   practice ensures an even sortie flow, eliminates excessive maintenance actions and limits the
   number of sorties canceled. The OG/CC is responsible for the flying program, and will
   coordinate with the MXG/CC to add or cancel sorties anytime during the month. However,
   flying scheduling effectiveness will be recorded when changing the weekly schedule. The
AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013                                                                     33


   OG/CC in coordination with MXG/CC and MSG/CC, is encouraged to modify or cancel all
   or part of the schedule when they are reasonably assured the UTE goal for the month will be
   met. Sorties may be cancelled for UTE management during the last five O&M days of the
   month and will be recorded as "UTE." Sorties cancelled for UTE are not included in the FSE
   rate computation.
   4.5.4. Year End Closeout. During the last 15 O&M days of the fiscal year, units are
   permitted to selectively add/cancel scheduled sorties to manage the end-of-year flying hour
   closeout. These additions/cancellations will be recorded as "UTE." This provision is intended
   to help units gradually close out end-of-year flying without creating hangar queen aircraft
   and unintentionally exceeding the UTE. Sorties cancelled for UTE are not included in FSE.
   However, sorties requiring munitions support should be evenly distributed throughout the
   fiscal year to preclude a high demand for munitions support during the month of September.
   IAW AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management, semi-annual
   inventories must be started and finished in March and September.
4.6. Combat Sortie Generation. Combat sortie generations are conducted to exercise the
wing’s ability to meet to the unit's combat sortie generation tasking under current war plans and
contingency operations.
   4.6.1. For scheduled combat sortie generations, publish the weekly flying schedule as a
   normal schedule. On the days the unit plans to exercise annotate scheduled exercise on the
   flying schedule and AF Form 2402, AF Form 2403 or electronic version. If an unannounced
   exercise is initiated, the remainder of the printed weekly schedule may be canceled and may
   be deleted from IMDS by the MO PS&D.
   4.6.2. Combat sortie generation will usually include operations using Air Tasking Orders.
   See paragraph 4.7 for ATO procedures.
   4.6.3. When a scramble launch scenario is used, a launch "window" will be established for
   each line number or block of line numbers. Normal deviations will be assessed against all
   sorties.
   4.6.4. Sorties lost due to required scenario responses such as chemical warfare condition
   “black,” airfield attacks, etc., will be recorded as "XEH or XEL."
   4.6.5. If more sorties are flown than line numbers printed, those sorties will be considered
   flown as scheduled.
   4.6.6. Once the objectives established by higher headquarters or the commander have been
   met, the remainder of that day's schedule may be canceled/deleted from IMDS by the MO
   PS&D.
   4.6.7. At the termination of the combat sortie generation, the unit's originally printed weekly
   flying schedule may be revised, canceled, or replaced with a new weekly schedule without
   recording deviations. Normal deviation reporting procedures will apply once finalized.
4.7. Air Tasking Order. The Air Tasking Order (ATO) can contain mission numbers, on-
status time/time on target and configurations. A daily flying schedule, including aircraft tail
numbers for the first lines and spares, will be finalized and confirmed to operations and the MOC
not later than 2 hours prior to the first on-status/take-off time. The new published schedule
derived from the ATO, is applicable to all affected organizations and no AF Form 2407 is
 34                                                         AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013


required to implement the new schedule. All changes after the new schedule has been published,
up to the first unit crew show time, will be documented and coordinated on an AF Form 2407.
Unlike a planned sortie surge, early and late take-offs are recorded on second and subsequent
sorties, unless an ops change is made to the ATO. Normal deviations will be recorded against all
sorties using the new published schedule derived from the ATO. Schedules will be sent to home
station for historical documentation IAW para 3.7.6; however, ensure classification guidance
IAW ATO is met. Note: All sorties launched under “Classified ATOs” will be considered
flown as scheduled. Classified ATO lines that are missed will be recorded as cancels in the
MIS. Cancellations will be loaded into the MIS once the sortie is declared cancelled
regardless of actual scheduled take-off time and ground aborts will be recorded in MIS.
   4.7.1. Alert Sorties. Sorties flown from alert because of a higher headquarters exercise,
   active air or practice scramble, or committed to fly from alert on the printed weekly schedule
   will be considered sorties flown as scheduled. Ground aborts will be recorded in MIS;
   however, no deviation is recorded against FSE, but the ground abort is recorded in MIS.
4.8. Unscheduled Tasking. When a unit is tasked with an unscheduled higher headquarters
tasking or self-initiated tasking (mobility exercises or weather evacuations), or other services
tasking which significantly impacts the printed weekly flying schedule, MO PS&D may revise or
delete the printed schedule from IMDS and replace with a new weekly schedule without
recording any deviations. For weather evacuations, the schedule will be cancelled in IMDS, not
deleted, so the data is available for historical attrition.
   4.8.1. If the schedule is revised or canceled and reprinted, the following procedures will be
   used:
       4.8.1.1. Normal deviation reporting procedures will be followed once the
       revised/reprinted schedule has been finalized. The revised schedule will be finalized a
       minimum of 2 hours before the first scheduled launch.
       4.8.1.2. Once the tasking terminates, the original schedule may be used or it may be
       revised or reprinted for the tasking period, as required. Normal deviation reporting is
       used once the revised or reprinted schedule is finalized.
       4.8.1.3. Normal deviation reporting procedures will be followed after a take-off time is
       established to a tasking by higher headquarters or other services.
   4.8.2. If the unscheduled tasking has an adverse impact on the monthly UTE goal, the
   commander has the option to adjust the monthly sortie UTE goal.
   4.8.3. An unscheduled tasking or actual combat operations may include use of an ATO.
   Deviations for all aircraft will be recorded IAW this instruction.
4.9. Scheduling Options to Maximize Sortie Production.
   4.9.1. Planned Sortie Surge. Units may plan to produce sorties at a higher than normal
   rate. A unit may also use a planned sortie surge when the rest of the unit is deployed to a
   different location. A planned sortie surge is not considered a combat sortie generation or an
   unscheduled tasking. It should be conducted in a manner that takes full advantage of training
   opportunities inherent in a period of increased operations and maintenance activity. The
   number of sorties will be determined by training objectives and established by the OS and
   AMXS commanders. Printed sortie surge rates will exceed the daily sortie rate (average
AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013                                                                      35


  contracted sortie per O&M day based on the applicable monthly sortie/flying hour contract)
  of the unit by at least 50%, but not less than the contract required sorties scheduled on the
  monthly contract/plan. For example, if a unit normally flies 6 sorties in a day, to qualify for a
  surge, that same unit would schedule at least 9 sorties for the surge day. The statement
  "Sortie Surge" must be printed in the remarks section of the affected day’s flying schedule to
  add sorties without incurring deviations.
     4.9.1.1. Surge scheduling scenarios should task maintenance and flying organizations
     realistically. For example, flat lining a surge is often not a feasible option. For example,
     scheduling a 7-ship to reach 14 sorties by turning the same 7 aircraft to fly 2 goes (7-ship
     turned 2 times) is often an unfeasible plan. Units should plan to get the maximum number
     of sorties possible from each aircraft committed to the schedule.
         4.9.1.1.1. Units should be cognizant of historical break rates and spare constraints
         when scheduling surges. Spares are quickly used up during surges and once spares are
         exhausted the capability to meet surge goals is severely limited.
     4.9.1.2. Extreme care must be exercised to avoid creating a backlog of unscheduled
     maintenance actions when scheduling sortie surges.
     4.9.1.3. Aircraft tail numbers, take-off times, line numbers, and configurations will be
     printed in the weekly schedule for each aircraft’s first sorties of each day. Include the
     statement "sortie surge" in the remarks section for each affected day.
     4.9.1.4. Only line numbers are required on the weekly schedule for subsequent sorties
     (i.e., the total number of sorties/line numbers the unit intends to fly). Other data such as
     take-off times, configurations, and missions may be printed as required by the unit. To
     the greatest extent possible, the day prior, units should try to confirm subsequent sorties
     NLT the daily maintenance production meeting.
         4.9.1.4.1. However, early and late take-offs are not recorded on second and
         subsequent sorties. For all other deviations, normal deviation reporting applies.
     4.9.1.5. If more sorties are flown than what was intended (e.g., line numbers printed),
     these sorties will be considered flown as scheduled.
  4.9.2. Continuation Sortie. A continuation sortie is a sortie containing scheduled
  operations stops. Maintenance provides support limited to chocking the aircraft and
  fire/safety observer and the aircraft engines/Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) must remain
  running. Continuation sorties are designed to accommodate training events, optimize aircraft
  use and minimize maintenance manpower expenditure. Continuation sorties will be clearly
  identified in the published weekly flying schedule. This scheduling option is intended to
  allow the exchange of aircrew with minimal maintenance participation and aircraft
  possession does not return to maintenance. The initial crew on the sortie will brief the follow-
  on crew at the aircraft. A Continuation sortie ends when the later mod is debriefed since
  both are assigned the same sortie number. Units may add continuation mods onto
  scheduled sorties to make up for sorties lost earlier in the same week without recording
  deviations. Do not include these added continuation mods in FSE unless there were no lost
  sorties earlier in the week. If no sorties were lost in the same week, the added continuation
  mod will be an “add” deviation in FSE. Note: No maintenance or servicing is performed
  during the stop. Returning the aircraft to maintenance terminates the continuation sortie.
 36                                                          AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013


   4.9.3. Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC). The ERCC sortie is used to optimize
   aircraft use. It involves turnaround of an aircraft incorporating partial or full crew change
   between two separate sorties. The difference between ERCC and continuation sorties is
   minor maintenance and servicing can be performed between sorties and since each is a
   separate sortie, deviations apply to each sortie. An aircraft is scheduled to fly an ERCC
   sortie in the published weekly schedule, upon landing, crew members are changed at the
   aircraft with at least one engine running. Minimum ground time should be scheduled between
   sorties. The crew of the first sortie must brief the crew of the second sortie at the aircraft.
   Other aircraft on the published flying schedule or previously flown aircraft not on the flying
   schedule (OCF, FCF, adds) can be tail swapped into the second sortie. For example, if two
   aircraft are scheduled to land at approximately the same time, either aircraft could ERCC to
   the later sortie. EXCEPTION: B-52 aircraft, engines may be shut down to re-pack drag
   chutes while crew change occurs.
4.10. Flying Scheduling Effectiveness Computations. Compute monthly flying scheduling
effectiveness rate by aircraft mission and design using the formulas below:
   4.10.1. Total sorties scheduled = Total sorties flown plus (+) cancellations minus (-)
   Additions (added sorties only).
   4.10.2. Adjusted sorties scheduled = Sum of total sorties scheduled (home base, off station
   or deployed) minus (-) UTE cancellations.
   4.10.3. Calculated deviations = Sum of all deviations (including added aircraft) minus (-) air
   deviations, aircraft tail swaps, aircraft printed spare actions, ground aborted sorties flown by
   spare aircraft (on-time), and UTE cancellations/additions.
   4.10.4. OP/MT deviations = Sum of all calculated deviations recorded using OP_ or MT_ as
   the deviation cause code (include GAA, GAB and GAC).
   4.10.5. Overall FSE rate = Adjusted sorties scheduled minus (-) calculated deviations
   divided (/) by Adjusted sorties scheduled times 100.
   4.10.6. OP-MT-FSE-rate = OP/MT-deviations divided (/) by adjusted sorties scheduled
   times (*) 100.

                    MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING EFFECTIVENESS

5.1. Purpose. Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness (MSE). This is a leading indicator that
measures the unit’s ability to plan and complete scheduled maintenance events (e.g., inspections,
periodic maintenance, etc.) and scheduled use of maintenance resources (static/Immediate
Response (IR)/training aircraft, etc.) on-time per the maintenance plan. The AFGSC goal for
MSE is 95 percent. A low MSE rate may indicate a unit is experiencing a high rate of turbulence
on the flight line or in the back shops. This indicator is primarily used as reliability indicator for
maintenance managers assessing the unit’s capacity to execute the scheduled maintenance plan.
   5.1.1. A cornerstone of successful maintenance scheduling and execution is an
   understanding of how the schedule is executed versus how it was scheduled to be executed.
   These differences in scheduled versus actual events are only recorded in the execution phase
   of the scheduling process and are called deviations. Deviation data will be recorded so that
   root cause analysis can identify the appropriate corrective actions if any are needed. Without
   deviation data, analysis is impossible. Deviation data recording and analysis is the beginning
   of the process to continually improve the scheduling and execution process that leads to
   improved unit flying operations. The unit is responsible for documenting deviations to the
   weekly flying and maintenance schedule and determining the cause for each deviation.
   Deviations must be coordinated with the appropriate squadron/AMU before being assigned
   to a specific category. Schedule deviations that result from a sequence of events will be
   assigned a primary cause. A determination of the primary cause will be made by the parties
   involved to arrive at a unit position. The squadron operations officer and the AMU
   OIC/AMXS maintenance operations, along with MO maintenance operations, will monitor
   deviations to ensure they meet the criteria in this publication. When conflicts arise,
   leadership of involved units will resolve them at the lowest level. All deviations will be
   recorded as described in this publication.
5.2. Computations:
   5.2.1. Compute the aircraft MSE using scheduled maintenance events in the printed weekly
   schedule. In order to make this data valuable it is important that the integrity of the data be
   maintained. Additionally do not discard standard accepted scheduling practices in order to
   improve rates, e.g., scheduling all inspections on Friday or not including hourly inspections
   in the weekly schedule. The IMDS database will be used to determine whether or not the
   maintenance actions were completed on time. For example, if a maintenance event is
   scheduled in the weekly flying and maintenance schedule for Monday through Wednesday,
   IMDS must show completed by 2359 on Wednesday for credit. For maintenance events
   extending into the next week, credit for completion is based on the last day of the scheduled
   event. Note: Phase inspection completion will be measured using the completion date of the
   inspection. AMXS and MXS supervision will standardize the scheduled duration of the
   inspection for each MDS based upon the work card deck and fix phase critical path data
   determined from historical data provided by MDSA and Phase supervision assessments.
   Standardized durations will be documented and forwarded to MO PS&D. See Table 5.2.
 38                                                         AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013


   5.2.2. The MXG/CCs may select additional areas (such as Aerospace Ground Equipment,
   Avionics Intermediate Shop, Alternate Mission Equipment, etc.) for local scheduling
   effectiveness tracking. The unit will establish standards for these programs. When reported to
   HHQ, these locally selected areas will not be included in aircraft MSE rates. The standards
   requirement is not applicable for Munitions/Missile maintenance schedules; however,
   MUNS/CC may elect to create MSE requirements for internal tracking. If munitions/missile
   units create an MSE requirement they must create a local policy with assigned weighted
   points for all maintenance actions.
   5.2.3. MO PS&D will implement procedures for reviewing and recording scheduled
   maintenance actions daily, forward this data to maintenance analysis weekly for computation
   and publication as a monthly metric (e.g., 1-31 Jan, 1-30 Jun, etc.). Daily review will be
   accomplished by MO PS&D and will not be delegated.
   5.2.4. When a unit is tasked with a combat sortie generation, unscheduled tasking,
   unannounced exercise/real world contingency, or HHQ exercise that significantly impacts the
   printed weekly maintenance schedule, the plan may be revised or reprinted without incurring
   deviations. Utilizing MSE deviation Table 5.1, normal deviation reporting procedures will be
   followed once the revised or reprinted plan is finalized. The unaccomplished portion of the
   original maintenance schedule that was revised will not be included in the scheduling
   effectiveness formula.
      5.2.4.1. Units may revise or reprint the following day’s or remainder of that week’s
      maintenance schedule to compensate for adverse weather. This adjustment should be
      used only in extreme cases and recorded on an AF Form 2407. Once changed, normal
      deviation reporting procedures will apply.
   5.2.5. Squadron commanders will coordinate to cancel and reschedule maintenance actions
   to coincide with the portion of the flying schedule that was canceled after the unit or OS has
   achieved the UTE goal for the month. These canceled maintenance actions will not be
   included in MSE computations.

Table 5.1. MSE Deviations and Functions
DEVIATION                FUNCTION

Maintenance (MT)         Actions canceled due to adding aircraft to the flying schedule, lack of
                         manpower, equipment or as a result of mismanagement.

Operations (OP)          Actions cancelled or not completed on-time for operational
                         considerations or as a result of adding aircraft to the flying and
                         maintenance schedule to meet operations requirements. This also
                         includes maintenance events not completed due to operations group
                         actions, e.g., Aircrew Flight Equipment section not completing
                         scheduled maintenance as published in the wing weekly flying and
                         maintenance schedule.

Supply (SU)              Deviations that result from verified parts back order condition.

Other (OT).              Aircraft impounded after publication of the weekly schedule,
                         unscheduled major maintenance where the scheduled maintenance
                         action cannot be accomplished because of tech data restrictions,
                         aircraft off base and unable to return or as a result of
                         productivity/utilization goal days.

EXCEPTION: Any scheduled maintenance for an aircraft that is possessed by
depot/PDM/Contract Field Team (CFT), that is not complied with because the aircraft is not
released for possession as scheduled to the owning unit does not count toward MSE
computations.

                                            Chapter 6

               DEPLOYED OPERATIONS AND OFF-STATION SORTIES

6.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes rules and procedures used in planning, executing,
evaluating, and reporting of unit flying and maintenance schedules at deployed locations where
unit maintenance is provided. Sorties flown at deployed locations where no parent unit
maintenance is provided are considered off-station sorties. If parent unit support is deployed, this
is considered the same as home station support and normal deviation reporting applies. Limited
launch support is not considered parent unit maintenance.
6.2. General. Normal deviation reporting applies to deployed operations except as noted in this
chapter. Data from deployed operations will be transmitted or forwarded back to home station to
be included in unit totals IAW AFGSCI 21-118.
6.3. Scheduling. In addition to the procedures for home station scheduling and reporting,
deployed units will use the following procedures when developing a weekly flying schedule and
reporting deviations:
   6.3.1. Separate block(s) of sortie sequence numbers will be assigned for deployment
   location(s).
   6.3.2. When a spare aircraft is launched for a scheduled deployment to a Forward Operating
   Location (FOL), the options in paragraph 6.5.1 apply to the home station and deployment
   location flying and maintenance schedules.
   6.3.3. Additions and cancellations at deployed locations, which are required to
   accomplish specific aircrew training requirements and make optimum use of available
   range time, are considered flown as scheduled. This does not relieve operations and
   maintenance from developing a viable and realistic flying schedule at the deployed location.
   The primary purpose of this flexibility is to allow the unit to make up non-effective sorties to
   ensure accomplishment of the deployment training plan. Procedures for changing the weekly
   schedule in Chapter 2 apply to deployment location flying and maintenance schedules.
   Additions and cancellations caused by ineffective planning are recorded.
   6.3.4. When operating at a deployed location using a daily ATO, follow procedures outlined
   in paragraph 3.7 and 4.7 of this instruction.
6.4. Deployed Daily Activity Report. Required information for deployed AFGSC units will be
transmitted to home station IAW applicable unit deployment plans. See AFGSCI 21-118,
Chapter 4, for required data.
6.5. Off-Station Sorties. Off-station sorties are those sorties flown from other than home
station and parent unit maintenance is not provided (e.g., cross-country sorties). Units will
publish sorties planned while off station. Take off and landing times may be TBD when
supporting another unit and the specific times are unknown at the time of publishing. The
following paragraphs outline the rules that apply to higher headquarters alert or off-station
sorties:
   6.5.1. When a spare is launched to the off-station/cross country location in place of the
   originally intended aircraft, one of the following options applies.
 42                                                          AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013


      6.5.1.1. Option 1. The originally scheduled prime aircraft, which remained on base, may
      fly the sorties of the departed aircraft for the remainder of the week without recording
      FSE deviations. However, maintenance scheduling effectiveness is based on the
      published weekly schedule.
      6.5.1.2. Option 2. The sorties may be tail-swapped with a printed spare aircraft on each
      day's schedule.
   6.5.2. When an aircraft is off-station and cannot return to home station for its scheduled
   sortie, a deviation will be recorded for the reason the aircraft was unable to return. The
   reasons will be specific, e.g., maintenance, operations, weather, etc. Note: If the off-station
   aircraft can fly its scheduled mission from its location, no deviation is recorded.
6.6. Deployed MO PS&D Support Operations.
   6.6.1. NLT 7 days after a new units arrival, MO PS&D Superintendent will visit all
   decentralized scheduling activities and provide technical assistance as needed.
   6.6.2. Units will follow home station guidance.
   6.6.3. Home station AVDOs will perform AVDO duties on deployed aircraft unless the
   possession changes to the deployed location. With home station AVDO approval, deployed
   MO PS&D will make MIS inventory/status transactions and coordinate message
   requirements with home station AVDOs. If possession changes, deployed MO PS&D will
   perform all AVDO duties.
   6.6.4. Units will use supplements to AFI 21-101 and AFGSCI 21-165 to develop weekly
   schedules and for FSE/MSE reporting.
   6.6.5. When deploying or deployed to the PACOM AOR, units in addition to AFGSCI 21-
   165 guidance will also follow AFI 21-101_PACAFSUP pre-deployment and deployment
   guidance.
AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013                                                                      43


                                           Chapter 7

                  FLYING SCHEDULING REPORTING PROCEDURES

7.1. Purpose. This chapter provides instructions on flying scheduling reporting procedures. The
flying schedule must be loaded in IMDS to track scheduling and deviation data. Once loaded, the
IMDS Proposed Maintenance Report (TRIC PMP) provides detailed base-level retrieval of
flying and maintenance schedule retrieved from IMDS. IMDS will also be used to provide higher
headquarters reporting of aircraft utilization.
7.2. Responsibilities:
   7.2.1. The MXG/CC will ensure procedures are established to verify the accuracy of all
   scheduling and deviation data.
   7.2.2. MO PS&D section will publish the weekly flying schedule IAW Chapter 3 of this
   publication on AF Forms 2400 series or computer generated forms. The MO PS&D will load
   the weekly flying schedule into IMDS by 1600L Friday or for UTA weekends last scheduled
   fly-day, Saturday or Sunday (exception: 2 hours after the squadrons last landing during
   printed wing night flying weeks) for the following week using the procedures in AFCSM 21-
   565V2. Refer to paragraph 4.5.1 of this instruction for daily tail number scheduling
   procedures.
   7.2.3. The MOC will review the on-line IMDS TRIC DRC, Debrief Sortie Recap, to ensure
   accuracy of aircraft debriefing inputs. MOC will also review TRIC DSM, Deviation
   Summary Inquiry, as well as TRIC UOL, Uncompleted Operational Events, daily to ensure
   uncompleted sortie lines are deleted using TRIC OED, Operational Events Delete, as
   necessary, i.e., after coordination with the debrief section and MO PS&D. Additionally,
   MOC will review TRIC AUR, Accomplishment Utilization Report weekly to ensure accuracy
   of reported deviations. MOC will also load additions, cancellations before crew show, late
   and early take-offs and landings, and tail swaps in IMDS as deviations occur.
       7.2.3.1. The debrief section will load aborts and in-flight emergency incidents in IMDS
       during the IMDS automated debriefing process. After a primary aircraft ground aborts
       and is replaced by a spare, debrief sections will ensure the deviation code is recorded as a
       spare deviation with the appropriate cause code (SP/GAA or GAB or GAC) against the
       original aircraft; debrief sections will not record the deviation as a ground abort
       (GA/GAA or GAB or GAC) against the original aircraft that was replaced by a spare.
       Analysis will count SP/GAA (GAB, GAC) as one ground abort deviation but will not
       count this against FSE (see paragraphs 4.3.2.5 and 4.3.4). For all other spare and ground
       abort deviations procedures, debrief will follow procedures in paragraph 4.3
       7.2.3.2. The MOC will coordinate with both the flying squadron and AMU on all
       changes and deviations to the daily flying schedule to assist in determining correct
       debriefing status codes. The MOC will provide sortie sequence numbers and sortie
       numbers to the squadron/AMU for all additions and cross-country sorties. Sortie numbers
       assigned to a specific tail number must be in sequential order (for example sortie number
       101 must be used on a specific tail number before sortie number 102). Unique sortie
       sequence numbers will be developed for deployed sorties.

     7.2.4. The following instructions apply to IMDS TRIC LCC, Maintenance Defer
     Codes/Operational Deviation Cause Codes; TRIC OED, Operational Event Delete; TRIC
     OES, Operational Event Tail Number Swap/Tail Number Spare; and TRIC DEV, Deviation,
     Start/Stop/Correction Abort/Delete. The Ground Deviation Code block cannot be blank.
     Enter one of the codes in Table 7.1 or one of the ground deviation codes in AFCSM 21-

                                            Chapter 8

                                  ATTRITION AND SPARES

8.1. Attrition. Attrition factors represent historical percentage of scheduled sorties lost to
causes outside unit control. Maintenance and operations schedulers add attrition sorties to
monthly contracts to ensure mission goals are met. Units may make a conscious decision, with
HQ AFGSC/A4M approval, to use different attrition factors from statistical attrition rates
calculated by MDSA.
   8.1.1. Attrition sorties are not substitutes for unit capability shortfalls, they are added to the
   contract to mitigate scheduling turbulence to facilitate that unit’s mission goals are met.
   Attrition sorties are planned for based on historical sortie losses captured and measured by
   MDSA. The monthly flying and maintenance plan will clearly identify attrition sorties for
   planning purposes. If attrition is less or more than planned, adjustments to the weekly flying
   and maintenance schedule will be made to prevent over-extending maintenance or exceeding
   the unit’s contract. A sortie lost will normally be flown in the same month the loss occurred.
   If at the end of a quarter combined losses exceed attrition figures, the OG and MXG/CCs will
   negotiate a resolution to the shortfall.
   8.1.2. The factors used to compute attrition will be MXx, OPx, SUx, WXx, ATx, SYx, OTx,
   EXH, EXL, and HQx cancels. Attrition and spare factors will be computed for and applied to
   each flying squadron. Monthly statistical attrition anomalies should be identified,
   documented and factored out of attrition calculations if necessary. MDSA will compute
   attrition factors monthly for each OS/AMU and provide the results to MO PS&D and OSS
   Current Operations. During the annual “Proposed FHP”, MDSA will provide attrition factors
   by month for the entire next fiscal year. Note: Attrition and spare factors need not be
   developed for test and evaluation (CB) possession identifier coded aircraft.
8.2. Attrition Factor Application:
   8.2.1. Attrition computation is based on unit historical data from previous similar flying
   months. For example, when computing attrition for Jan 12, use historical data for Jan 11, Jan
   10, Jan 09, Jan 08, Jan 07, etc. Use as much historical data as required ensuring seasonal
   variations are considered to determine a basis for attrition. When computing attrition, use the
   total sorties lost in a particular category. Do not use the difference between the sorties lost
   and those sorties added to make up for the losses. The formula for computing the attrition
   factor is shown in Figure 8.1.

8.3. Prorated Weather Attrition:
   8.3.1. Computation. Weather attrition sorties will only be used when sorties are lost because
   of weather. Weather attrition sorties will not be carried over into another month. Using the
   weather attrition factor, compute the number of anticipated sortie losses for weather. Divide
   the number of weather losses by the O&M days. This will determine the prorated weather
   attrition. See Table 8.3 for an example.

Table 8.3. Sample Application of Prorated Weather Attrition Factor.
Sorties Required                                 1000

Subtract the weather attrition factor from 1     (1-0.03) = 0.97

Divide 1000 by 0.97                              1000/0.97

Equals Required Sorties to Schedule              1031

Minus Sorties Required                           1000

Expected Weather Losses                          31

Divide 31 by O&M Days (20 for this exercise)     31/20

Expected Sortie Losses per O&M Day               1.55

   8.3.2. A unit would expect 1.55 sorties lost each O&M day in the month for weather. Thus, a
   total of 31 sortie losses (1.55 sorties x 20 O&M days) would be expected for that month.
   Whenever weather losses exceed the total projected weather losses (number of O&M days to
   date x 1.55, round up to the next whole number), a unit may add sorties not to exceed the
   difference between the sorties lost due to weather and the total projected weather losses. For
   example on the 11th O&M day of the month, a unit lost a total of 30 sorties to-date due to
   weather. The expected prorated weather sorties lost to-date is 18 (1.55 times 11 equal 17.05,
   round up). The unit also added 4 weather sorties earlier in the month. The unit could add up
   to 8 sorties (30 sorties lost to date due to weather minus 18 prorated losses minus 4 weather
   adds equals 8 weather adds available).
8.4. Spares. The spare requirements will not exceed 50 percent of aircraft committed to the
flying schedule, rounded up to the next whole aircraft. Note: During planned sortie surges, the
MXG/CC determines the amount of spares that will be committed. Units should be cognizant of
their historical break rates and spare constraints when scheduling surges. Spares can be quickly
used during surges and once spares are exhausted the capability to meet surge goals is severely
limited.
   8.4.1. MDSA computes annual spare aircraft requirements by month, using historical aircraft
   first sortie logistics losses and provides this information to the MO PS&D for use in
   computing spare aircraft requirements. Spare computation is based on unit historical data
   from previous similar flying months. For example, when computing spares for Jan 11, use
   historical data for Jan 10, Jan 09, Jan 08, Jan 07, Jan 06, etc. Use as much historical data as
AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013                                                                        49


   required ensuring seasonal variations are considered to determine a basis. The formula for
   computing spare factors is Historical First Sortie Deletions/Cancellation divided by historical
   first sorties scheduled.
       8.4.1.1. A first sortie is defined as a sortie flown by an aircraft that has not previously
       flown for the day (flying period between 0001-2400). For example, if 4 aircraft are
       committed to the schedule and there are 6 total sorties scheduled, the first 4 sortie line
       numbers (e.g., 101-104) should reflect all 4 committed aircraft tail numbers before they
       are re-scheduled (turned) against the last 2 (e.g., 105-106). This would be reflected as a 4
       x 2 and should not be reflected as a 2 x 4 because of scheduled take-off times.
           8.4.1.1.1. Operations may define first sorties or turns by mission profile, take-off
           times, but for the purposes of this instruction the sortie turn pattern is defined against
           initial aircraft flown and scheduled turns of the same or a portion of the same aircraft.
       8.4.1.2. See Table 8.4 for an example.

Table 8.4. Sample Application of Spare Factors.
1st Sortie Maintenance Cancellations                   0.10

1st Sortie Supply Cancellations                        0.03

1st Sortie Ground Aborts                               0.05

Spare factor                                           0.18 or 18%

       8.4.1.3. A sample of 4 first sorties is used in the following computation:
       8.4.1.4. Spare aircraft required = 1st sorties scheduled times the spare factor
       8.4.1.5. 4 x 0.18 = 0.72 (rounded up to the next whole number). Thus, the spare required
       is 1.
   8.4.2. The computed spare requirement may be adjusted to compensate for multiple
   configurations and syllabus constraints. When additional spares are added for multiple
   configurations, units will not exceed one spare per configuration.
       8.4.2.1. Additional spares are authorized to support higher headquarters tasking and
       special missions (if required by the tasking).
       8.4.2.2. At least one spare aircraft is authorized per MDS for each flying day.

Terms
Active Associate—ARC/ANG component unit retains principal responsibility for weapon
system or systems; shares with one or more AD units.
Addition—An increase in sorties or aircraft added to the printed weekly flying schedule.
Air Abort—An airborne aircraft that cannot complete its primary or alternate mission.
Air Deviation Code—A deviation from the scheduled sortie flight plan occurring after aircraft
take-off.
Alert Sorties—Sorties flown from alert because of a higher headquarters exercise, active air or
practice scramble, or committed to fly from alert on the printed weekly schedule will be
considered sorties scheduled and flown as scheduled.
Attrition—Losses expected based on historical data. Sorties added by maintenance scheduling
to a unit's sortie contract to allow for expected losses due to maintenance, operations, supply, air
traffic control, sympathy, HHQ, other cancels, and weather cancels as computed IAW
Attachment 2. If attrition is less or more than planned, adjustments to the schedule should be
made to prevent overextending maintenance and/or to stay within the unit's sortie flying hour
program. Attrition sorties are not substitutes for capability shortfalls; they are additive to the
contract to ensure mission goals are met. A sortie lost will normally be flown in the week/month
the loss occurred. If at the end of a quarter, losses exceed attrition figures, the OG/MXG CCs
will come to an agreement on how the shortfall will be corrected.
Attrition Reserve—Reference AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment,
Distribution, Accounting, and Termination. Attrition reserve aircraft are those aircraft required to
replace primary aircraft inventory losses in a given year projected over the life span of the
weapons system. These aircraft are distributed to operational and training units to evenly spread
AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013                                                                     55


life cycle fatigue and ensure all aircraft receive periodic systems upgrades and modifications.
Assigned attrition reserves are occasionally realigned to maintain fleet balance.
Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI)—Aircraft above the PMAI to permit scheduled and
unscheduled maintenance, modifications, inspections and repair without reduction of aircraft
available for operational missions.
Cancellation—An aircraft or sortie that is removed from the printed schedule for any reason.
Change—A recompilation of a unit's month-by-month flying hour plan, this is required when
the unit's flying hour allocation changes.
Chargeable Aircraft (CHRG ACFT)—The number of aircraft against which units should build
their programs. Except in cases where possessed aircraft is forecast to be significantly different
from the PMAI such as in building or down-sizing units, chargeable aircraft will normally equal
the unit's PMAI, PTAI, or PDAI, as applicable. In these cases, HQ ACC/A3 will assign a
chargeable aircraft accountability for the unit in the ACC Flying Hour First Look and Baseline
Messages.
Classic Associate—AD component unit retains principal responsibility for weapon system or
systems; shares with one or more ARC/ANG units.
Combat Sortie Generation—A process by which aircraft are generated in a minimum time,
during peacetime or wartime, through concurrent operations that may include refueling,
munitions loading/unloading, aircraft reconfiguration, and -6 inspection and other servicing
requirements. These exercises test a wing’s ability to meet current war plans and contingency
operations.
Continuation Sortie—A scheduled sortie containing scheduled operation stops. When a crew
completes their training/mission and performs an operation stop, the engines/APU remains
running and maintenance does not service the aircraft. The aircraft can subsequently be launched
without the participation of maintenance personnel, except for a fire/safety observer. The prime
purpose is to on/off load crew members.
Crew Ready—An aircraft that has been properly inspected, fueled, required weapons loaded,
necessary maintenance actions completed, the exceptional release signed off (for the first flight
of the day) and the tail number passed to operations. Note: Units will develop and publish
specific crew ready times for each assigned MDS as agreed upon by the OG/CC and MXG/CC.
Crew Show—The time that the aircrew arrives at the aircraft.
Deployed Sorties—Sorties launched away from home base or isolated areas at home base, with
parent-unit maintenance provided. For the purpose of this instruction deployed sorties are
considered home station sorties.
Daily Maintenance Production Meeting—Meeting required by AFI 21-101 and AFI 21-
101_AFGSCSUP to review the previous day’s accomplishments, verify aircraft and equipment
utilization and scheduled maintenance requirements for the current and next day, establish work
priorities, and coordinate schedule changes.
Deviation—A departure from the printed weekly flying schedule.
Early Landing—Scheduled sorties landing more than 30 minutes prior to scheduled landing
time. Early landing deviations are not included in FSE calculations.
 56                                                           AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013


Early Take—off—Scheduled sorties launched more than 30 minutes prior to scheduled take-off.
Exercise—A unit or higher headquarters event designed to test or evaluate an organization's
plans, procedures, and operational/maintenance capabilities. Exercises are a planned sortie surge,
a combat sortie generation, or an unscheduled tasking. Operational readiness inspections and
wing directed operational readiness evaluations are combat sortie generations.
Extended Sortie—Scheduled sorties that land more than 15 minutes past the scheduled landing
time. If the extended sortie originated on time, record the subsequent late take-off or deletion
against the agency that caused the late landing. If the extended sortie did not originate on time,
record the subsequent sortie deviation against the agency that caused the original delay.
Ferry Sortie—Those sorties flown to transfer an aircraft to or from a maintenance facility or to a
new assignment, including inter-command, inter-unit transfers.
Flown as Scheduled Sortie—A sortie flown by a specific aircraft on the date and time indicated
on the printed weekly schedule, and those aircraft that are defined as "flown as scheduled"
elsewhere in this instruction.
Flying Scheduling Effectiveness (FSE) Rate—The FSE rate is the percentage of sorties flown
as scheduled. This rate determines how efficiently the planned/printed flying schedule was
executed. It also indicates unit turmoil caused by flying schedule deviations.
FSE Maintenance/Operations (MX/OPS) Deviation Rate—The number of maintenance and
operations deviations divided by adjusted sorties scheduled multiplied by 100. Reflects the
number of deviations within unit control. The MX/OPS deviation rate is a subset of FSE. Only
count the MX/OPS deviations used to compute the FSE rate.
Functional Check Flight (FCF)—The flight of an aircraft, in accordance with the applicable
dash -6 manual, to verify the airworthy condition of the aircraft.
Ground Abort—Event after crew show time that prevents a "crew ready" aircraft from
becoming airborne. Ground aborts are categorized as maintenance (GAA, GAB, GAC),
operations, HHQ, weather, sympathy, other, etc… The difference between a ground abort and a
cancellation is after crew show it is a ground abort, before crew show it is a cancel. A ground
abort by itself is not a deviation, but can cause a deviation such as lost sortie or late take-off.
Higher Headquarters—A controlling agency above wing level.
Home Station Sortie—Sorties launched from the home base or deployed locations where parent
unit maintenance is provided.
Immediate Response Aircraft—Mission capable aircraft postured to meet short-notice taskings
which allow flexibility in meeting required Designed Operational Capability (DOC) timing.
In—Flight Emergency (IFE)—An airborne aircraft that encounters a situation or emergency
that results in an IFE being declared by the aircrew. (Not a deviation, but will be recorded IAW
Chapter 6.)
Tail Swap—Tail number swaps made to the daily flying schedule IAW paragraph 4.3.2.6
Aircraft tail swaps are swaps between printed aircraft on the same day, between printed aircraft
and spare aircraft on the same day or between printed aircraft and aircraft that have previously
flown that day (cross country return, OCF, FCF, etc.) The term is synonymous with the
previously used term “Interchange.”
AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013                                                                       57


Late Landing—Aircraft landing 30 minutes past its scheduled landing time, does not apply to
continuation sorties. If the sortie originated on time, record the subsequent late take-off or
cancellation against the agency that caused the late landing. If the extended sortie did not
originate on time, record the subsequent sortie deviation against the agency that caused the
original delay. Late landings are not included in FSE calculations.
Late Take—off—Scheduled sortie launched more than 30 minutes after scheduled take-off time.
Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness—A measurement used to determine what percent of the
scheduled maintenance actions were actually completed as scheduled in the weekly flying
schedule.
Mission, Design, and Series (MDS)—An acronym for aircraft mission, design, and series. For
example: B052H, B002A, etc.
Off—Station Sorties—Sorties flown away from home base (cross-country) and parent unit
maintenance is not provided. This includes aircraft that divert or break off-station and parent unit
maintenance is sent to repair and launch the aircraft. Note: Off-station sorties are considered
flown as scheduled. Deviations incurred are not used in scheduling effectiveness or abort rate
computations.
Operational Check Flight (OCF)—The first flight of an aircraft that has had extended
downtime or extensive maintenance which does not require an FCF.
Operations and Maintenance Day (O&M)—Monday through Friday, not including federal
holidays or command directed family days.
Pen—and-Ink Changes—Changes made to next week's flying schedule on AF Form 2407 after
the WG/CC has signed the schedule and prior to 1600 hours local Friday. Exception: Pen-and-
Ink changes are allowed 2 hours after the squadron's last landing during printed wing
night flying weeks.
Planned Sortie Surge—A scheduling option where a unit may plan to produce sorties at a
higher than normal rate. To qualify as a surge, the number of planned sorties will exceed the
normal daily sortie rate by at least 50 percent. This will be based on the monthly daily sortie rate
as determined by MO PS&D. Possessed Aircraft—Aircraft under a wing commander's
operational control and responsibility IAW AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and
Utilization Reporting.
Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI)—Aircraft assigned to meet the primary aircraft
authorization (includes PDAI, PMAI, POAI, PTAI). PMAI will not change except when
approved by HQ USAF. Reference: AFI 16-402
Primary Development/Test Aircraft Inventory (PDAI)—Formerly CB or Test. Aircraft
assigned primarily for the test of the aircraft or its components for purposes of research,
development, test and evaluation, operational test and evaluation, or support for testing
programs.
Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI)—Formerly CC/CA PAA Coded Aircraft. Aircraft
assigned to a unit for performance of its wartime mission.
Primary Other Aircraft Inventory (POAI)—Formerly ZA, ZB. Aircraft required for special
missions not elsewhere classified.

Primary Training Aircraft Inventory (PTAI)—Formerly TF. Aircraft required primarily for
technical and specialized training for crew personnel or leading to aircrew qualification.
Program Element (PE)—The PE is the smallest unit of military output controlled at the DOD
level. It is identified by a six-digit alphanumeric program element code (PEC). The sixth
character, “F", identifies the PE with the Air Force.
Program Element Code (PEC)—The six digit alphanumeric code used to identify the Program
Element (see definition above).
Ready Aircrew Program (RAP)—Continuation training regulated under the AFI 11-2 MDS
specific series for training of aircrews assigned to units primarily flying fighter, bomber, and
LDHD PMAI. The AFGSC flying hour program centers around unit RAP tasking orders and the
associated flying hours derived using the flying hour program models.
Scheduled Sortie—An aircraft scheduled for flight by tail number on the weekly flying schedule
and confirmed on the daily flying schedule. Incentive flights are considered scheduled sorties
and published in the weekly schedule. Functional Check Flights and Operational Check Flights
are excluded.
Scheduled Maintenance Action—A maintenance requirement printed in the weekly schedule.
Sortie—A sortie begins when an aircraft becomes airborne or takes off vertically from rest at
any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when the aircraft returns to the surface except
for continuation sorties.
Sortie Contract—A written agreement between operations and maintenance and approved by
the WG/CC. It specifies the number of sorties and hours to be flown.
Spare Aircraft—An aircraft specifically designated on the flying schedule to replace aircraft
that cannot fly its sortie. Spares can include aircraft that have been canceled, aborted, flown an
earlier sortie, scheduled in a later sortie, or an aircraft that has been released after FCF/OCF. Do
not count "Printed Spares" used as deviations when computing FSE.
Spare Ground Abort—Event after crew show time that prevents a "crew ready" aircraft from
becoming airborne, but is replaced by a spare that meets the mission requirement. Spare ground
aborts are categorized as maintenance (GAA, GAB, GAC). The difference between a ground
abort and a spare ground abort is the scheduled line is accomplished, where the ground abort is
not. A spare ground abort is not a deviation, but can cause a deviation such as late take-off. Spare
ground aborts do not count towards FSE.
Total Active Inventory (TAI)—Aircraft assigned to operating forces for mission, training, test,
or maintenance functions (includes primary aircraft inventory, backup aircraft inventory,
attrition, and reconstitution reserve).
Training Goal—The unit's completion of a formal course training syllabus and/or phase of
instruction (TF coded units only).
Unscheduled Tasking—Tasking in which initial notification occurs after publication of the
weekly schedule.
Unit Training Assembly (UTA)—A planned period when guard or reserve personnel
participate in training duty, instruction, or test alert. For the purposes of this instruction, one
UTA is considered a single Saturday through Sunday weekend. This is an authorized and
AFGSCI21-165 21 MARCH 2013                                                                  59


scheduled training assembly lasting at a minimum of 4 hours. This assembly is mandatory for all
troop program unit members. (AR 135-91)
UTE Remaining—A measurement of the UTE required to accomplish a unit's remaining flying
hours with assigned aircraft over the remaining months of the fiscal year.
Utilization (UTE)—For AFGSC aircraft, the UTE is expressed in the number of sorties flown
per aircraft per month.
Weekly Flying and Maintenance Schedule—The schedule, agreed to by operations and
maintenance, and signed by the OG/MXG/WG/CCs, to support the unit's flying and maintenance
requirements. In this publication it is referred to as the "flying schedule."
