Section A—Managing AETC Trainer Development Activities

1. Function. AETC trainer development activities design, develop, fabricate, and assemble
training equipment to meet the definition prescribed for federal stock class (FSC) group 69.
www.DRMS.DLA.mil/asset/fsclist.html. Additionally, trainer development activities produce
training equipment not meeting the criteria of FSC 69 when the training equipment’s sole
purpose directly supports an Air Force career field education and training plan item. These
activities support the AETC training mission at training wings (TRW), flying training wings
(FTW), fighter wings (FW), special operations wings (SOW), and air mobility wings (AMW).
4                                                                  AETCI21-109 13 APRIL 2010


Additional responsibilities include quality control, modification, repair, refurbishment, and
maintenance of manufactured training devices. Trainer development activities provide life-cycle
support (depot) for all trainers they develop. AETC trainer development activities can accept
project orders (PO) for funding according to Department of Defense (DoD) 7000.14-R, DoD
Financial Management Regulation, Volume 11A, Reimbursement Operations, Policy and
Procedures, Chapter 2, Project Orders.
    1.1. Requests for trainer development services from units normally supported by the wing
    owning the trainer development activity (wing to which the trainer development activity is
    assigned) will be referred to as internal requests for the purpose of this instruction (paragraph
    2).
    1.2. Requests for trainer development services from units not normally supported by the
    owning wing will be referred to as external requests for the purpose of this instruction.
    Requests resulting in transfer of funds to a trainer development activity from an organization
    outside the wing are considered external even if the wing conducts the training. For example,
    a local training detachment conducts training, and the using command funds the project.
2. Organization. Air Force organizational structures are located in AFI 38-101, Air Force
Organization. Trainer development activities will be located within the training/support
squadron, maintenance squadron or group, as applicable. Trainer development activities
determine the internal organization most efficient for their activity, ensuring all responsibilities
in this instruction are assigned within the activity. Trainer development activities vary in
personnel authorizations, design capabilities, and craft skill availability. These differences are
due to the variety of missions and unique nature of these activities. Trainer development
activities are encouraged to participate in lateral support due to the unique design capabilities of
each activity. Each trainer development activity is normally responsible for providing support to
the following organizations or activities:
    2.1. Keesler and Sheppard AFB trainer development activities support their respective
    TRWs. The Keesler trainer development activity also provides support to the training group
    at Vandenberg AFB in the event the local 30 operational support squadron trainer
    development activity is unable to support a development/fabrication requirement.
    2.2. Randolph AFB trainer development activity supports all AETC FTWs, FWs, AMWs,
    San Antonio area AETC bases, and Goodfellow AFB.
    2.3. Kirtland AFB trainer development activity supports the SOW, other AETC units at
    Kirtland, and the USAF Survival School at Fairchild AFB.

Section B—Responsibilities

3. HQ AETC/A4/7. HQ AETC/A4/7 approves all operating policies and procedures for AETC
trainer development activities governed by this instruction.
4. HQ AETC/A4MMP. HQ AETC/A4MMP is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for
procedures prescribed by this instruction.
5. 2 AF/TTOC-O. The 2 AF/TTOC-O provides centralized staff management for AETC trainer
development activities governed by this instruction. The 2 AF/TTOC-O executes maintenance
and modification support policies for AETC-developed training equipment, and functions as the
AETCI21-109 13 APRIL 2010                                                                        5


production approval official for all external trainer development requirements. Specifically, 2
AF/TTOC-O can task one trainer development activity to provide lateral support to another
trainer development activity, or task a trainer development activity with trainer fabrication
requirements in support of other Air Force organizations or government agencies if the capability
exists. Route the 2 AF/TTOC-O tasking through the tasked trainer development activity’s group
commander. Accomplish command approval of such projects on an AETC Form 375, Training
Equipment Request. Prioritization of these projects will normally follow the priorities prescribed
in Table 1, but 2 AF/TTOC-O may grant exceptions.
6. Group Commander. The group commander responsible for the trainer development
activity:
   6.1. Ensures a training equipment review and production approval system for trainer cost
   and feasibility studies and fabrication requests originating within his or her area of authority
   is established. The group commander designates the following duties and/or functions:
       6.1.1. Training Equipment Reviewing Official. The training equipment reviewing
       official is designated by name or office symbol. More than one person may be designated
       due to the potential volume of requests.
           6.1.1.1. The official reviews internally generated AETC Form 375s, evaluates the
           mission need of the item, number of students in the class, number of classes per year,
           length of training, and whether the potential cost of the item justifies its need.
           6.1.1.2. The official forwards approved requests to trainer development or returns
           disapproved requests with rationale to the requester, as applicable.
       6.1.2. Trainer Development Function. The trainer development function provides a
       cost and feasibility study to determine capability, ability to meet need time, commercial
       availability, etc. This function forwards requests not rejected to the production approval
       official or requester, as applicable, and returns rejected requests, with rationale, to the
       reviewing official or requester, as applicable.
       6.1.3. Internal Production Approval Official. Internal production approval officials
       are normally organizationally aligned above the trainer development activity responsible
       for forecasting training requirements.
           6.1.3.1. These officials perform a comprehensive evaluation of the request. Officials
           must measure the true cost for estimated labor (even if not passed on to the requester)
           and materials, and determine if the request is mission essential. If provided, officials
           evaluate commercial availability or General Services Administration (GSA)
           equivalents that could fulfill the requester's needs. Officials then compare the request
           to the estimated labor, material, and life-cycle costs. If a commercially available
           equivalent is more cost effective, the requester procures it. If production approval
           officials approve the request, they assign a work priority to the project (Table 1) and
           forward it to the trainer development activity for fabrication. Officials return
           disapproved requests, with rationale, through the training equipment reviewing
           official to the requester.

Notes:
1. Use the weapon system FAD if an open program management directive exists; for example,
B-1B, FAD I-1. If the weapon system FAD is not established, use the FAD of the gaining
MAJCOM if that MAJCOM is the major user of course graduates. If course graduates are used
by multiple commands (example, precision measurement equipment laboratory), use the
AETC FAD. If the fabrication requester possesses an organic FAD below FAD III, use the
requester’s organic FAD; for example, Air National Guard, FAD IV.
2. AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11, Attachment 11A-12,
A12.2.1. Issue Systems, authorized use of higher FAD.
3. PJCs A, B, and C are the only categories authorized to support the UMD manning. PJCs D
and E, when authorized and approved by 2 AF/TTOC-O, may be used to earn manpower
authorizations.
PJC LEGEND:
A—Training equipment required to directly support a Career Field and Education Training
Plan (CFETP) training item in an AETC resident course. A training deviation will result
without the training equipment.
B—Same as A except a training deviation will not result without the training equipment.
C—Training equipment used in resident courses, not based on a CFETP requirement. Training
equipment will enhance the instruction.
D—External non-AETC projects directed by 2 AF/TTOC-O.
E—Other projects directed by 2 AF/TTOC-O.

               6.1.3.2. Internal production approval officials advise trainer development of an order
               of need for each approved request. This allows trainer development to properly
               schedule the fabrication request.
        6.2. Establishes local procedures to prevent the misuse of trainer development facilities, and
        ensures the most economical use of skills assigned.
        6.3. Establishes a trainer development activity orientation program for appropriate personnel
        in normally supported units.
        6.4. Ensures a maintenance and supply requirement review is completed for equipment
        fabrication requests. As a minimum, address life-cycle support in critical design reviews and
        design, and planning function evaluations.
        6.5. Ensures subordinate formal training course commanders annually forecast their training
        equipment development requirements. Ensures they report these requirements to the local
AETCI21-109 13 APRIL 2010                                                                         7


   organization responsible for the trainer development activity. Requirements will reflect
   organization, course number, equipment nomenclature, funding for training fabrication, and
   quantity desired. Make every effort to program for training equipment needs. This will
   reduce or eliminate financial reimbursement between different organizational elements
   operating from a common FTW or TRW operation and maintenance fund. For different
   funding plans, coordinate requests through HQ AETC/FM and 2 AF/TTOC-O channels.
   6.6. Ensures the trainer development activity provides design, planning, fabrication,
   technical writing, major maintenance, modification, overhaul, and refurbishment of training
   equipment. Portions of this support may be accomplished through the use of contract sources
   at the determination of the group commander.
   6.7. Provides a management system to record disposition and modification of fabricated
   training equipment requiring configuration similarity to AETC life support, egress, and
   aircrew training equipment. AETC-fabricated equipment includes, but is not limited to, life
   support, egress, and other aircrew training devices possessing a combined labor and material
   value of more than $7,500.

8. Trainer Development. Trainer development activities determine the organizational structure
most efficient for their activity. The following functions may be assigned completely or in part to
different units within the organization:
    8.1. Fabrication Function. The fabrication function supervisor is responsible for
    managing, supervising, and training assigned personnel, and managing fabrication resources
    to achieve quality production. The fabrication function:
       8.1.1. Monitors daily workloads with special emphasis on work center backlogs, and
       coordinates with workload control to resolve discrepancies.
       8.1.2. Ensures coordination between the project leader and applicable shop units to
       ensure fabricated items meet requirements established by the engineering function.
AETCI21-109 13 APRIL 2010                                                                      9

     notifies applicable agencies of problems.
  8.2. Engineering Function. The engineering function supervisor is responsible for
  managing, supervising, and training assigned personnel, and managing resources for the
  design and development effort needed to fabricate training devices. The engineering
  function:
     8.2.1. Processes work order requests received from workload control.
     8.2.2. Prepares feasibility and design studies. Note: Consider the simulator interface
     management-ware (SIMWARE) concept when developing computer-based simulators or
     trainers. The SIMWARE concept does not make use of SIMWARE mandatory; however,
     it must be one of the alternatives considered when developing new and/or making major
     modifications to existing computer-based simulators or trainers. The SIMWARE concept
     puts control of the operational software into the hands of the user. SIMWARE is a
     software shell, giving users the ability to create, select, add to, or modify computer-based
     simulator or trainer functions without the need of specialized computer programmers, or
     the purchase of nonstandard proprietary software or hardware.
     8.2.3. Determines the most cost-effective method of procuring and fabricating training
     equipment or other approved items.

   9.11. Maintains due-in records and document register.
10. Specific Work Center Function. Work center functions fabricate parts, subassemblies,
assemblies, and complete trainers. Work centers use TOs, TMs, blueprints, and sketches as
guides for work, and as quality checks for each item. Work centers install training equipment,
and perform on-site maintenance and modification. Work centers generally consist of machine,
electrical, welding, paint, woodwork, sheet metal, and assembly functions. Some functions may
be combined to accomplish the unique mission of the work center as follows:
   10.1. The machine function provides fabrication and repair of trainer parts, assemblies, and
   tools according to engineering prints, sketches, and oral instructions. It ensures machine tool
   setup procedures, machine cutting operations, hand operations, and general machine function
   operations adhere to approved procedures. It also ensures proper selection of specified
   material before fabrication.
   10.2. The electrical function fabricates and repairs electronic and electro-mechanical training
   equipment and components according to engineering prints, sketches, and oral instructions
   by using conventional electrical, solid state electronics, and printed circuit construction.
   10.3. The welding function fabricates repairs, modifies, and welds metal components
   according to engineering prints, sketches, and oral instructions. It ensures proper selection of
   specified materials and equipment for welding.
   10.4. The paint function prepares and masks components, and assembles them in preparation
   for the painting process. The function follows engineering prints, sketches, and oral
   instructions to paint components with the correct equipment and paint specified. It removes
   old paint coatings, cleans components, and assembles components as directed.
   10.5. The woodworking function fabricates repairs, modifies, and assembles training
   equipment and components out of wood and plastics according to engineering prints,
   sketches, and oral instructions. It prepares resin castings and moldings.
   10.6. The sheet metal function provides for the fabrication of sheet metal, fiberglass and
   plastic components, related hardware, jigs and fixtures, and master production templates
   according to engineering prints, sketches, and oral instructions. It ensures required testing is
   completed on fabricated metal tubing, conduits, and cables.
12                                                                 AETCI21-109 13 APRIL 2010


     10.7. The assembly function assembles and repairs training equipment and components
     according to engineering prints, sketches, and oral instructions. It prepares trainers for final
     inspection and shipment.

Section C—Trainer Development Services/Support

11. Overview. Trainer development activities support AETC resident or formal training
courses. Each organization plans, designs, develops, fabricates, maintains, modifies, repairs, and
refurbishes locally fabricated AETC training equipment. As instructed by AETCI 21-301, the
organization also develops and publishes TMs that provide part identification and information on
the assembly, installation, operation, service, disassembly, overhaul, and reassembly of trainers.
12. Design. Trainer development activities possess a trainer design and planning function that
designs and develops training equipment fabrication packages according to requester’s needs.
These planning packages contain design drawings, material and labor cost estimates (including
overtime and/or over hires), and additional remarks. Trainer development activities provide a
database for designated production-approval officials to evaluate training equipment requests.
These activities reject requests when there is a readily available, cost-effective commercial or
GSA substitute, the item is not within the function's capability to design and fabricate, or
personnel are not available.
13. Fabrication. Typical shop skills usually available include machine, sheet metal, welding,
metalworking, plastic, wood, corrosion, painting, electronics, electrical, fiberglass, fabric,
leather, rubber, and production assembly. Training equipment fabricated by AETC development
activities must:
     13.1. Satisfy authorized requirements.
     13.2. Technically be suitable.
     13.3. Be in compliance with all DoD and Air Force policies and directives.
     13.4. Fabricate normally according to best commercial practices, as opposed to military
     specification (MILSPEC) standards.
14. Modification. Trainer development activities provide modification support services for
AETC fabricated training equipment within their capability.
15. Repair Services. Trainer development activities provide maintenance and repair support for
locally fabricated training equipment when such maintenance and repair is beyond the capability
of other maintenance activities. AETC Form 394, Trainer Development Instruction Slip, or
equivalent, is used for in-house repairs and maintenance dispatch. Organizations outside the
trainer development activities request trainer repair or maintenance support using AETC Form
375. Trainer development activities support scheduled and unscheduled maintenance for
equipment fabricated in their activities. Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance support applies
only to training equipment fabricated by AETC trainer development facilities that support AETC
resident training courses. Trainer developments using unit manning document (UMD) assigned
personnel to perform field maintenance on other than fabricated trainers will develop local OIs
for this activity. (Note: Repair services support may be accomplished through unit maintenance
contracts.) Procedures in the OI will document approved man-hour usage from 2 AF/TTOC-O
and account for man-hours expended.
AETCI21-109 13 APRIL 2010                                                                         13


16. Storage. Trainer development activities will provide an area for storing and screening
excess training equipment if such equipment is for the trainer development activity’s use, reuse,
or disposal, and if:
   16.1. A strong potential exists for future need based on historical demands for similar
   equipment.
   16.2. Excess equipment is of sufficient quantity or possesses recoverable high cost
   components that are useful to future projects. Note: Storage, screening, or control costs could
   be prohibitive or not cost-effective when compared to actual procurement costs. Use good
   judgment to prevent excessive accumulation of reclaimed equipment.
   16.3. Excess equipment contains components whose value makes them cost-effective to
   store for support of like fabricated equipment remaining in service.

Section D—Fabrication Cycle Procedures

17. Overview. The training equipment fabrication cycle consists of request initiation, review,
design and planning, production approval, and training equipment fabrication.
18. Request Initiation. Use AETC Form 375 to request design, fabrication, feasibility studies,
modification, or repair services of fabricated training equipment from AETC trainer development
facilities. Identify specific training equipment needs and requirements. This request package
serves as a statement of training equipment requirements. Use only AETC Form 375 for FSC 69
type trainers or those approved by 2 AF/TTOC-O. See paragraph 20 for other projects.
19. Review. The training equipment reviewing official conducts a complete review of the
information provided on the AETC Form 375 and accompanying documents. The reviewing
official determines if the request is worth continuing with design and planning. Send approved
requests to design and planning. Return requests disapproved to the original requester with
reasons for disapproval.
20. Design and Planning. Design and planning includes a review of available AETC training
equipment, commercial training equipment, or GSA publications (catalogs, pamphlets,
portfolios, etc.) to determine if equipment portrayed in these publications satisfies the
requirements. This equipment may be available locally or at other AETC bases.
   20.1. Determine if previously completed local or other AETC base planning packages can
   fulfill a part of the requester's needs, saving duplication of the entire planning process. 2
   AF/TTOC-O determines whether the trainer development supporting the requester will
   receive the planning package or the developing activity will support the request if another
   activity develops a planning package.
   20.2. Determine if commercial training equipment or GSA-listed property has the potential
   to fulfill the requester's needs and is available. If cost-effective equipment items are available
   (estimated labor plus materials), trainer development prepares a memorandum of
   explanation. Trainer development references sources in the memorandum and attaches the
   memorandum to the AETC Form 375 request. Return the memorandum and AETC Form 375
   through the reviewing official.
21. Production Approval. This involves a complete review of the planning package by the
production approval official. The minimum elements of this review are the total estimated labor
14                                                                AETCI21-109 13 APRIL 2010


(including overtime and/or over hire), materials cost, the project priority (suggested by the
reviewer), maintainability requirements, and use of requested training equipment. The approved
package is sent to the trainer development activity. Return disapproved packages, through the
reviewing official, to the original requester with the reasons for disapproval.
22. Training Equipment Fabrication. Upon workload control receipt of an approved planning
package, schedule it for production according to work scheduling priorities, materials to be
ordered, requester's need date, and established labor skill cycle (for example, metal shop,
electronic shop, wood shop, paint shop). Trainer development activities use AETC Form 714, or
equivalent, to record and monitor training fabrication requests. In addition, use AETC Form 715,
or equivalent, (by quantity, part number, stock number, nomenclature, costs, etc.) for all
materials and parts required for a specific work order (development project).

Section E—Internal General Support Projects and Non-AETC Mission Support

23. Internal General Support Projects. Process internal general support projects (projects that
are not trainers and do not fit trainer development guidelines) produced by trainer development
personnel as follows:
     23.1. Submit requests by memorandum to the trainer development activity for approval or
     disapproval.
     23.2. Examine each request to ensure fabrication will not conflict with commercial
     procurement and contract policies.
     23.3. Analyze the cost to build, buy, or contract.
     23.4. Approve requests (trainer development activities) if the total cost (including labor and
     materials) is $7,500 or less. The applicable group commander approves requests exceeding
     $7,500.
        23.4.1. The internal production approval authority determines which local activity is
        most capable of accomplishing the approved request.
        23.4.2. Approved internal general support projects will be accomplished on a
        noninterference basis and will not impair the activity's ability to perform primary
        requirements.
     23.5. Maintain documentation for each request, to include the cost decision (worksheets,
     cost comparisons, etc.), and the original letter requesting the project.
     23.6. Internal general support projects will not be documented as trainer development, and
     will not be used as a basis for manpower authorization determination. Internal general
     support projects (to include local manufacture projects) must not exceed 5 percent of the
     unit's quarterly man-hour availability.
24. Non-AETC Mission Support. Under certain conditions, AETC provides limited trainer
development support to external requesters outside of AETC. Generally, activities can support
these external requests with available work hours providing these requests do not adversely
affect AETC resident course support. AETC course support has priority.
     24.1. Submit AETC Form 375 (completed through block 18) to 2 AF/TTOC-O for non-
     AETC support approval (external requests should be submitted by the applicable
AETCI21-109 13 APRIL 2010                                                                       15


   [MAJCOM]). The tasked trainer development activity evaluates the work request and
   determines if it can meet the specified project requirements. A MOA will be accomplished
   between the tasked trainer development activity, the requesting activity, and 2 AF/TTOC-O.
   If the trainer development activity determines the request is beyond its capability, 2
   AF/TTOC-O will route the request to another trainer development activity for evaluation.
   Both trainer development activities and requesting organizations will participate fully in the
   coordination process as follows:
       24.1.1. Send formal communications, except technical information exchanges, through 2
       AF/TTOC-O.
       24.1.2. Trainer development activity returns a copy of the AETC Form 375 to 2
       AF/TTOC-O with work order number entered in block 21.
   24.2. The trainer development activity, with 2 AF/TTOC-O and MAJCOM coordination,
   initiates an MOA for the project. The MOA should address funding, officials authorized to
   represent the requester's design limits, office symbols, life-cycle logistics support, standards
   used during design and production, operating and TO requirements, and anticipated
   production completion dates. Local development activities can submit additional items as
   required.
   24.3. Trainer development activities will develop procedures to dedicate equivalent man-
   hours to a non-AETC requester’s project when overtime or over hires are authorized and
   funded. Over hire personnel may work on other projects, and direct personnel may work on
   non-AETC projects as deemed necessary by the trainer development chief to make the most
   efficient use of resources. Ensure overtime or over hire labor hours are charged for
   reimbursement from the requester only when those hours are expended in support of the
   requester’s project.
   24.4. For non-AETC projects, the requestor provides funding directly to the trainer
   development activity once 2 AF/TTOC-O has approved the project. Coordinate PO funding
   changes directly between the trainer development activity and the requester.
       24.4.1. PO and direct fund cite funding include cost for materials, shipping, special
       project equipment, temporary duty (TDY), AF IMT 9, Request for Purchase, contract
       services expenditures, personnel overtime, and over hires. The trainer development chief
       is authorized to certify funds available on AF Form 9 contract expenditures for services
       and commodities.
       24.4.2. Normally, the DoD organization making the request is not charged for civilian
       labor unless overtime or over hire is required to complete the project.
   24.5. A trainer development activity tasked with an external project will have overall
   engineering responsibility and final decision authority for the external project.

Section F—Work Priorities

25. Overview. The production approval official assigns a work priority to trainer development
requests using a force activity designator (FAD) according to AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply
Manual, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 11, and priority justification category (PJC) code listed in
Table 1.1 of this instruction. The production approval official will further prioritize work
16                                                                AETCI21-109 13 APRIL 2010


requests of equal FAD-PJC priority by establishing a realistic date required in AETC Form 375,
block 3a. The earliest date required will normally determine the work scheduling order. Note:
Trainer development activities may, in coordination with the local school activities, establish and
utilize a local prioritization system for internal projects.
26. Scheduling Priorities. The production approval official forwards prioritized work requests
to the workload control function for production scheduling. Work requests in the fabrication
process will not be interrupted for a higher priority work request without the approval of the
trainer development chief.
27. Priority Waivers. When a production deviation becomes necessary, the production
approval official initiates, in writing, a waiver (priority change) describing the circumstances
and/or reasons for the deviation from the approved production order of merit. The official will
attach the waiver to the appropriate AETC Form 375, and send the package back to the
development activity. Note: Coordinate deviations to 2 AF/TTOC-O tasked fabrication projects
with 2 AF/TTOC-O.
28. Deferred Priorities. The production approval official, through coordination with the
requester, reaffirms the need for approved and prioritized work requests that have not been
placed into production within 1 year.
29. 2 AF/TTOC-O-Directed Priorities. The 2 AF/TTOC-O will use AETC Form 375 to task
development activities for external projects, after coordinating requirements, feasibility, etc. The
2 AF/TTOC-O, or designated official, signs the AETC Form 375 production approval block and
assigns a work priority. Deviation to these priorities requires 2 AF/TTOC-O approval.
30. Work Backlog. Prioritize work backlogs into the design and fabrication process. Monitor
work backlog locally for planning purposes. Do not use backlogged work to report manpower

Section G—General Information

31. Supply Procedures. Process requests for locally fabricated training equipment according to
AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 9, Requisitioning, and
AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 27, Research and Records
Maintenance, and their respective supplements.
32. Assignment of an Expendability, Recoverability, and Reparability Code (ERRC):
     32.1. Assign locally fabricated training equipment an ERRC of NF3 or XB3 as appropriate.
     32.2. Locally fabricated training equipment with repairable components that have an Air
     Force Materiel Command assigned ERRC are assigned an ERRC no lower than the highest
     ERRC assigned to any integral component.
33. Man-Hour Accounting. Document man-hours expended in the design study, development,
and fabrication process against a specific work order. Use total man-hours expended for the cost
computation of trainer value. Use AETC Form 428 or equivalent to document man-hours.
Guidelines for computing labor costs are in paragraph 34 of this instruction. AETC Form 380, or
equivalent, may be used as a record for labor and material costs. If used, retain AETC Form 380,
or equivalent, with AETC Form 375 upon completion of a trainer development request.
AETCI21-109 13 APRIL 2010                                                                         17


34. Establishing a Standard Shop Rate:
   34.1. Apply the trainer development shop rate to determine the cost of estimated labor
   required for a project. This rate will apply whether a project involves planning and design
   only; planning, design, and limited craft skills support, or all capabilities. The shop rate is a
   management tool that allows the development manager and training manager to make cost-
   effective build or buy decisions for training equipment acquisition.
   34.2. Count personnel assigned to the trainer development activity to develop a
   comprehensive shop rate. Include personnel assigned, for example, supervisors, clerical
   support, assigned work center supply support, planning and design personnel, technical
   writers, drafters, illustrators, direct labor, over hires, etc. Compute the shop rate on an annual
   basis by 1 October. Include scheduled civilian government service pay raises. Additionally,
   compute the shop rate for assigned personnel changes of 10 percent or more.
   34.3. Determine the total work-year trainer activity cost for civilians (general schedule [GS],
   wage grade [WG], wage leader [WL], and wage supervisor [WS]) as follows:
      34.3.1. List each assigned grade and total personnel for that grade. See Attachment 2,
      Table A2.1, for a sample format in this instruction.
      34.3.2. Contact the base financial management office to identify the applicable pay grade
      table for GS civilians. Select the corresponding annual pay from the column titled
      accelerated annual pay. For each grade, compute and list the total accelerated annual pay
      by multiplying the number of personnel listed in that grade by the accelerated annual pay
      value.
      34.3.3. For WG, WL, and WS civilian, compute and list each grade's total work-year
      hours by multiplying the number of personnel listed in each grade by 2,087 hours per
      year. Using the applicable base pay rates, select and list the applicable employee hourly
      base pay rate at step 3 (contact the base financial management office for the current rate).
      Use the acceleration factor (contact the base financial management office for the current
      factor) to accelerate and list the hourly base pay rate including summed factors for
      civilian retirement and benefits. Apply summed factors directly to the base rate; they are
      not compounded. For each grade, compute and list the total accelerated annual pay by
      multiplying the accelerated hourly base rate by that grade's total work-year hours.
      34.3.4. Determine the total work-year cost for assigned personnel by summing the total
      accelerated annual pay of each listed pay grade.
   34.4. Determine the total available productive direct labor hours as follows:
      34.4.1. Identify direct labor personnel as those who can document their man-hour
      expenditures in the man-hour accounting system, paragraph 33.
      34.4.2. Multiply the number of direct labor personnel by the total work-year hour factor
      (2,087 hours). Take into account part-time direct labor personnel by estimating what
      percentage of their time is devoted to direct labor in trainer development.
      34.4.3. Sum the computed available productive direct labor hours.
   34.5. Compute the standard shop rate by dividing the total work-year cost, paragraph 26.3.4
   by the total available productive direct labor hours, paragraph 26.4.3.
18                                                               AETCI21-109 13 APRIL 2010


35. Quality Control. Each trainer development activity will develop a comprehensive and
thorough quality control program, and implement the program by publishing a local OI. Assign
personnel from within the trainer development activity to perform quality verification
inspections on fabricated training equipment. Use craft shop procedures and workmanship
guidelines prescribed in the following TOs to develop the quality control program:
     35.1. TO 00-25-234, General Shop Practice Requirements for the Repair, Maintenance, and
     Test of Electronic Equipment.
     35.2. TO 1-1A-1, General Manual for Structural Repair.
     35.3. TO 1-1A-8, Structural Hardware.
     35.4. TO 1-1A-9, Aerospace Metals - General Data and Usage Factors.
     35.5. TO 1-1A-14, Aircraft Electrical and Electronic Wiring (Installation Practices).
     35.6. TO 1-1A-15, General Maintenance Instructions for Support Equipment.
36. Materiel Control. Manage bench operating stock and shop stocks. Before initiating turn-in
actions, coordinate with other trainer development activities for possible use of excess assets.
37. Screening Excess Property for Parts. AETC trainer development activities are
encouraged to screen excess property located at the local Defense Reutilization and Marketing
Office. Property items may be issued when they are used for training purposes. Take care to
prevent the misuse of excess property.
     37.1. Ensure selected property items have strong potential for use in future fabrication
     projects or for the repair of existing AETC-fabricated training equipment.
     37.2. Caution should be used when selecting "nice-to-have" excess property. It could exceed
     reasonable storage and property control capabilities available to trainer development
     activities.
     37.3. Identify and store excess property to provide reasonable retrieval and environmental
     protection. The minimum information required for identification is the FSC, part number (if
     available), and noun. Note: Each trainer development activity must work with base supply to
     develop a procedure to notify the development activity when there is a turn-in of any 6910L
     (locally fabricated) stock numbered items. The fabrication activity may then screen the items
     for recoverable components, assemblies, etc.
38. Trainer Development Portfolio. Trainer development activities will prepare a portfolio
(paper or electronic), which includes information specific to each activity, highlights its
capabilities, describes and shows a representative sampling of training equipment fabricated by
the activity, and provides information needed by a potential customer. Descriptions in the
portfolio should be in sufficient detail for the customer to easily determine the purpose and
capability of each trainer. Review the portfolio periodically and update so the contents represent
the current capability of the trainer development activity. Distribute copies to 2 AF/TTOC-O,
customers, and others on request. Trainer development activities are encouraged to also provide
this information on the Internet.
39. Drawings and Photographs. The 2 AF/TTOC-O is the OPR and official release authority
for AETC trainer development technical drawings or photographs. The 2 AF/TTOC-O reviews
each request on a case-by-case basis, and provides rationale for disapproval. Any drawings or
AETCI21-109 13 APRIL 2010                                                                       19


photographs released for use by DoD activities will not be passed on to non-DoD activities
without 2 AF/TTOC-O concurrence. Any drawings or photographs approved for release will
clearly display the following statement: “This drawing or photograph is the property of the
United States Air Force. It may contain proprietary data and is not releasable in whole or in part
to any non-DoD activity or agency.” Additionally, if 2 AF/TTOC-O authorizes the release to a
non-DoD activity or agency, the responsible trainer development activity will include
instructions emphasizing to the non-DoD activity or agency that they cannot release the drawings
or photographs in part or whole without prior approval of 2 AF/TTOC-O.
   39.1. When foreign activities request drawings or photographs, 2 AF/TTOC-O forwards the
   request to the Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC/COMV) at Wright Patterson
   AFB for coordination.
   39.2. AFI 36-2251, Management of Air Force Training Systems, and AFI 21-402,
   Engineering Drawing System, paragraph 6, exclude AETC trainer developments from Air
   Force engineering drawing and associated list requirements when preparing engineering data
   for one-of-a-kind training aids in direct support of AETC resident course.
40. Computer Products. Approved computer-equivalent products or computer-generated data
may be used in place of nonfillable forms.

Section H—Reporting

41. Quarterly Status Report for Trainer Development Projects. Trainer development
activities tasked with external and internal projects will forward a quarterly status report in the
form of an electronic spreadsheet with the following tabs: Projects Pending, Projects in Work,
and Projects Completed. The report will cover calendar quarters and is due by the 20th day of
the month following the close of a quarter. The project is open until the trainer is delivered to
the customer. Note: This report is exempt from the RCS requirement according to AFI 33-324,
The Information Collections and Reports Management Program: Controlling Internal, Public,
and Interagency Air Force Information Collections, paragraph 2.11.12.
