    Clinic
    (Bldg 2114).
    4.2. Periodic dental examinations for military personnel should be scheduled through each squad-
    ron’s health monitor by the dental clinic AFDRAP monitor.

       out prior notification, may be considered to have broken the appointment.
       4.3.2. If an appointment must be canceled, it should be canceled at least 24-hours in advance.
    4.4. When active duty personnel report to a dental clinic, they will be in military uniform or civilian
    dress. No one reporting in bare feet or tank tops will be treated due to infection control and treatment
    sanitation requirements.
