   2.4. Expend or turn back all allocated munitions per fiscal year.
3. Flying Hour Development Program.
   3.1. Wing Annual Flying Hour Program. The Wing Annual Flying Hour Program (FHP) is
   the comprehensive annual process and associated documentation by which the Wing
   agencies execute the MAJCOM FHP as planned and documented in Wing annual, quarterly,
   monthly, and weekly flying and maintenance plans (“flying schedules”).
   3.2. Annual Flying and Maintenance Plan. The Annual Flying and Maintenance Plan
   documents are produced through the planning and cooperation of the Fighter Squadron,
   Operations Support Flight, Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, Maintenance Squadron, and
   Maintenance Operations Flight supervision and schedulers. This plan consists of the
   aggregate flying and maintenance schedules developed to balance long-range fleet health and
   equipment and personnel readiness while providing training, currency, proficiency, and “cost
   of business” sorties for assigned/attached pilots. The annual plan is constructed IAW AFRCI
   21-165, AFI 21-101/AFRC/SUP, AFI 11-2F-16V3, F-16 Operations Procedures, the
   MAJCOM RAP Tasking Message, and other applicable guidance based on the historical
   performance/capability data and the best available information on requirements and
   capability available. Adjustments are made in subsequent quarterly, monthly, and weekly
   scheduling meetings as new information or requirements occur. The annual FHP consists of
   monthly plans that include the number of required sorties, flying hours, ordnance, support
   (adversaries, ranges, tankers, controlling agencies, etc.); non-standard events and
4                                                            301FWI21-165 12 APRIL 2013


    requirements, night flying, exercises, cross country sorties and deployments will be
    coordinated and incorporated as appropriate.
    3.3. Wing FHP Annual Plan Milestones. The annual FHP development process consists of
    the following milestones:
       3.3.1. First Look report—an internal wing document that highlights maintenance
       capacity and operational requirements; provides 301FW/CC all known factors for next
       FY FHP.
       3.3.2. Flying Hour Allocation—The AFRC Baseline Allocation Message is the contract
       between AFRC and 301FW for flying hours.
       3.3.3. Wing FHP Planning and Planning Factors—coordinated wing response to baseline
       allocation message, constructing the FHP to accomplish the allocations.
    3.4. First Look. The First Look report is an internal wing document intended to highlight
    potential maintenance-capacity and operational-requirement disconnects in the upcoming
    year (AFI 21-101/AFRC/SUP).
       3.4.1. First Look requirements begin on or about 15 March and shall be developed IAW
       AFRCI 21-165 chapter 2 and AFI21-101/AFRC/SUP chapter 7
       3.4.2. NLT 15 March, Plans, Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D) shall task
       maintenance Analysis section to provide a capabilities assessment (wing policy).

       accomplished during the first weekly scheduling meeting of April (wing policy).
       3.4.5. NLT 25 April, OPS shall provide the requirements listed below, by month, for the
       entire fiscal year (AFRCI21-165). Information shall normally be presented at the second
       or third weekly scheduling meeting of April (wing policy).
           3.4.5.1. Number of Operations and Maintenance (O&M) days required (AFRCI 21-
           165). O&M days for this purpose are the number of scheduled flying days per month
           to meet OPS Combat Mission Ready (CMR) requirements.
           3.4.5.2. Compute the number of sorties required per O&M day to meet the
           operational requirement using the formula: (Number of sorties required) divided by
           (number of O&M days in a given month). Sorties per day will be computed by
           month for the entire fiscal year (AFI21-101/AFRC/SUP).
           3.4.5.3. Compute monthly scheduled sortie requirements using the formula: (Number
           of sorties or hours required) divided by (1 minus the attrition factor). Example:
           (1,000 sorties or hours required) divided by (1 minus 0.15) equals 1,177 sorties or
301FWI21-165 12 APRIL 2013                                                                    5


         hours to schedule. Remember to round any part to the next whole sortie or hour.
         (AFI21-101/AFRC/SUP).
     3.4.6. NLT 25 Apr, 301MOF Analysis shall provide Sortie UTE Rates. Compute UTE
     rates by month for the entire fiscal year for contracted (required) sorties and scheduled

     been approved by both 301OG/CC and 301MXG/CC (AFRCI 21-165)
  3.5. Flying Hour Allocation. The number of flying hours allocated to the 301FW is
  determined by AFRC IAW AFI 11-102 using the Air Force Single Flying Hour Model.
  Requirement sources include AFI 11-2F16 AFRC Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) messages,
  as well as AFRC and 10th Air Force (10AF) instructions and Operations Plans (OPLANS).
  The AFRC/A3 will forward a Baseline Allocation Message that will become the contract
  between AFRC and the 301FW. The flying hour allocation may be distributed to separate
  TFI accounts; active duty pilots shall not utilize hours allocated for AFRC, and AFRC pilots
  shall not utilize hours allocated for Active Duty. 301OSF/DOO shall manage utilization of
  TFI hour flying hour allocation. For purposes of flying hour allocation AFRC pilots include

301FWI21-165 12 APRIL 2013                                                                    7


  4.1. Annual Flying and Maintenance Plan. In conjunction with the FHP development, OPS
  and MX will publish an annual flying and maintenance plan that consists of the following
  (wing policy):
     4.1.1. Annual Flying Plan In conjunction with the FHP development, OPS will develop
     an annual flying plan that accomplishes RAP, munitions expenditure and deployment
     readiness. The calendar portion of the 301MXG/CC and 301OG/CC-approved annual
     flying plan shall be depicted in weekly, monthly and quarterly Wing schedules
     4.1.2. Annual Maintenance Plan. In conjunction with the FHP development, MX will
     develop a long-range maintenance plan, by month for the entire year that forecasts all
     known major maintenance that reduces airframe availability. This includes but is not
     limited to phase projections, weight and balance, aircraft wash, TCTOs or any item that
     will make the airframe unavailable for more than 72 hours. If the exact timing of the
     required maintenance item is not known, a projection shall be made that demonstrates
     relative airframe availability for purposes of identifying sortie production limitations.
     The long range plan shall be in checkerboard format showing daily aircraft availability
     for each month.
  4.2. Contract Sorties. In order to maintain required currency and qualification for pilots,
  MX and OPS will “contract” a specified number of sorties on a monthly basis onto which the
  historical monthly attrition rate will be applied to arrive at “scheduled” sorties.
  4.3. Attrition. Historical monthly attrition rate is computed by 301MOF Analysis IAW
  AFRCI 21-165, Chapter 6. OPS and MX will consider all operational factors when adding
  attrition sorties. Extreme variations in local weather may make monthly attrition predictions
  unreliable; using a high monthly attrition factor may result in a schedule that strains
  manpower and resources to support. OPS and MX may jointly agree to average attrition over
  a defined period to overcome manning shortfalls and resource limitations that might result
  from using high historical attrition during certain months (wing policy).
     4.3.1. Monthly contract sortie goal will be coordinated through the 457FS/DO to meet
     RAP and mission taskings.
     4.3.2. Contract sortie requirements will be briefed by OPS at the OPS/MX Squadron
     Scheduling meeting. Application of attrition factors to meet the contract sortie goal shall
     be jointly agreed upon by OPS and MX.
     4.3.3. Sortie goal shall be published in the quarterly, monthly and weekly schedule;
     progress toward sortie goal shall be presented weekly during wing scheduling meeting
     IAW paragraph 4.8.1.5.
  4.4. Scheduling Parameters. The following parameters are used by OPS and MX schedulers
  to construct the annual, quarterly, and monthly flying schedules:
     4.4.1. Turn Times. Standard turn time from scheduled landing time to next engine start
     time is driven by estimated times listed in Technical Orders to accomplish required
     through-flight tasks; without prior coordination with MX supervision, turn times will not
     be scheduled less than:
         4.4.1.1. A/A: 1.5 Hours
         4.4.1.2. A/G: 2.0 Hours

    4.5. Aircraft Generation (wing policy).
       4.5.1. Standard Daily Schedule. MX will normally commit up to 50 percent of Primary
       Aircraft Assigned to the daily flying schedule. For example, with 24 PAA, this equates
       to ten front lines in two configurations with two spares (one per configuration) for a total
       of twelve aircraft committed to the flying schedule per day (Wing Policy).
       4.5.2. MainUTASchedule. With 24 PAA and associated manning, MX will normally
       generate 14 aircraft for Main UTAs; 12 front lines plus two spares. D-Model
       incentive/orientation sorties will be scheduled as coordinated at the OPS/MX Squadron
       Scheduling meeting.
       4.5.3. Surge Scheduling. MX will generate up to 100% of available aircraft to support
       surge flying operations. Spares level will be coordinated at squadron-level in weekly
       meetings and real-time as the surge is ongoing.
301FWI21-165 12 APRIL 2013                                                                   9


     4.5.4. Split Operations. During periods with deployed aircraft and personnel, the total
     number of sorties scheduled and aircraft committed (including spares) will normally
     equal no more than 50% of PAA (twelve aircraft for 24 PAA) unless otherwise
     coordinated and agreed upon by MX and OPS Squadron and Group supervision.
