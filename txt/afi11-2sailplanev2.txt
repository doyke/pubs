SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
revision updates the purpose paragraphs, references, and includes use of the AF Form 8A; makes
ballast management an emergency procedures evaluation area for TG-15 pilots (paragraph
1.4.1.5 and Table 2.2); removes the provision for cadet temporary certificates of evaluation
(paragraph 1.5); adds the advanced soaring in-flight guide to the publications check (paragraphs
2.1.2.2 and 2.1.2.2); deletes requisites from mission evaluations (Table 2.1); allows any periodic
sailplane evaluation to count towards the periodic evaluation requirements of other sailplanes
(paragraphs 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4); and simplifies Area 32 evaluation criteria (Table 3.1).

                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Conducting Evaluations. Units will conduct all evaluations in accordance with the
provisions of AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Program and this
instruction.
1.2. Procedures:
     1.2.1. Flight examiners (FE) will use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter 3 for
     conducting flight and emergency procedures evaluations (EPE). To ensure standard and
     objective evaluations, each FE must become thoroughly familiar with the prescribed
     evaluation criteria.
     1.2.2. Conduct all evaluations in two-place sailplanes. Unless specified, the examinee will
     fly in the seat that best enables the FE to conduct a thorough evaluation. The FE normally
     occupies the front seat during periodic instructor mission evaluations.
     1.2.3. Prior to the flight, the FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and
     how it will be conducted. The examinee accomplishes required flight planning during the
     evaluation and furnishes the FE a copy of necessary mission data, mission materials, and
     maps (as required).
     1.2.4. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. Debriefs include the
     examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified),
     and any required additional training. The FE will debrief a squadron supervisor after all
     evaluations. A squadron supervisor must attend the debrief if the overall grade is
     Qualification Level 3 (Q-3).
     1.2.5. To initially qualify as an instructor, a pilot must successfully complete a dedicated
     initial instructor evaluation. Subsequently, crewmembers designated as instructors will be
     evaluated on their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations. FEs will act as students
     for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability.
1.3. Grading Instructions:
     1.3.1. Tolerances in performance parameters are based on conditions of smooth air and
     stable aircraft conditions. Momentary deviations from tolerances will not be considered in
     grading, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not
     jeopardize flying safety. Consider cumulative deviations when determining the area grade.
     Airspeed criteria are given in knots indicated airspeed (KIAS).
     1.3.2. FEs will use the evaluation criteria in Table 3.1 to determine individual area grades.
     When individual areas are performed well above the grading criteria standards, then make an
     appropriate comment stating performance and/or instruction was commendable in the
     Examiner’s Remarks in the Comments block of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
     Qualification or AF Form 8A, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple Aircraft). FEs
     must exercise judgment when wording of areas is subjective and specific situations are not
     covered.
AFI11-2SAILPLANEV2 22 OCTOBER 2010                                                                  5


     1.3.3. Derive the overall flight evaluation grade (Q-1, Q-2, or Q-3) from the area grades,
     based on a composite of the observed events and tasks according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2,
     this instruction, and FE judgment.
     1.3.4. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the examinee in order to
     successfully achieve the mission objectives. If the examinee receives an unqualified grade in
     any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will be unqualified (Q-3). Critical areas
     are identified by "Critical" in the area title in Table 3.1. Grade critical areas as qualified
     ("Q") or unqualified ("U").
     1.3.5. The general evaluation criteria in Table 1.1 apply during all phases of flight (except as
     noted in Table 3.1 for specific events).

1.4. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). FEs will administer an oral EPE on the
ground. During the evaluation, the FE will include a sampling of emergency procedures resolved
to a logical conclusion.
     1.4.1. The FE will include an evaluation of the following items on the EPE:
        1.4.1.1. General knowledge to include aircraft systems, operating procedures, and the
        National Airspace System (NAS).
        1.4.1.2. Emergency procedures. Evaluate all boldface procedures and at least one non-
        critical aircraft emergency procedure.
        1.4.1.3. Off-field landing procedures.
        1.4.1.4. Advanced programs information (if certified).
        1.4.1.5. Ballast management (for TG-15 qualified pilots)
     1.4.2. Units will not permit examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade (Q-3) because
     of an unsatisfactory EPE to fly in any aircrew position until the examinee completes a
     successful reevaluation.
1.5. Completion of AF Form 8 or AF Form 8A. Record aircrew member qualifications using
the AF Form 8 or AF Form 8A, in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 2.

     1.5.1. When an evaluation in one aircraft satisfies the evaluations requirements in another
     aircraft, include a comment stating so in the examiner’s remarks on an AF Form 8.
     1.5.2. With the exception of restrictions and exceptionally qualified designation (if used),
     place all comments on the reverse side of the AF Form 8 or AF Form 8A.
1.6. Waivers. Each MAJCOM Director of Operations (A3) is the waiver authority for the
individual aircrew requirements in this instruction. Units will submit waiver requests through the
chain of command to the OPR.

                                             Chapter 2

                              EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General. There are four types of sailplane evaluations: qualification (QUAL), mission
(MSN), instructor (INSTR) and spot. Evaluations include requisites and required areas. Table 2.1
indicates when a requisite is required (R) for an evaluation. Table 2.2 prescribes required areas
that must be included in the flight evaluation profile. Evaluation areas are aligned under the type
of evaluation.
      2.1.1. Alternate Evaluation Methods. Alternate evaluation methods are not authorized. If
      the FE determines one or more of the required items cannot be adequately evaluated, the
      examinee must complete an additional flight to complete the evaluation.
      2.1.2. Publications Check. The FE will check the following publications during the
      evaluation:
         2.1.2.1. For TG-10 evaluations: TO 1G-10(T)-1CL-1, Pilots’ Abbreviated Flight Crew
         Checklist, USAF Series TG-10B/C Sailplanes; the local in-flight guide (IFG), and the
         advanced soaring IFG (if certified).
         2.1.2.2. For TG-15 evaluations: TO 1G-15(T)-1CL-1, Pilots’ Abbreviated Flight Crew
         Checklist, USAF Series TG-15A/B Sailplanes; the local IFG, and the advanced soaring
         IFG (if certified).
         2.1.2.3. When a periodic evaluation in one aircraft satisfies the evaluation requirements
         in another aircraft, check each set of publications.
2.2. Requisites. Table 2.1 indicates the minimum requisites for each type of evaluation. When
periodic evaluations are combined, accomplish all requisites for each evaluation and document in
the ground phase of the AF Form 8 or AF Form 8A. When a periodic evaluation in one aircraft
satisfies the evaluation requirements in another aircraft, requisite examinations may be combined
into a single exam.

evaluations will include two sorties to accomplish Area 34, Simulated Rope Break. Periodic pilot
evaluations may include either one or two sorties. When two sorties are flown, the examinee
should fly in both seats, CG permitting. Include all required areas from Table 2.2 in the flight
evaluation profile. The examinee will perform all takeoffs and landings. A periodic QUAL
evaluation in any sailplane may satisfy the periodic QUAL evaluation requirements in any
sailplane so that only one periodic QUAL evaluation is required.
2.4. Instructor Pilot (IP) Evaluations. Following the initial MSN/INSTR evaluation, all
periodic IP evaluations are combined MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluations to evaluate both
proficiency and instructor ability. All initial instructor evaluations will include a minimum of
two sorties. Periodic instructor evaluations may include either one or two sorties. All IP
evaluations will include all required areas from Table 2.2 in the flight evaluation profile. Units
will publish evaluation profiles based on examinee certifications and provide mission materials
suitable for use as notional student training records. The examinee determines the mission profile
to accomplish optimum student training (based on mission materials provided) and all required
areas. The examinee will perform a takeoff and landing. The examinee debriefs the examiner
after the sorties. A periodic MSN evaluation in any sailplane may satisfy the periodic MSN
evaluation requirements in any sailplane so that only one periodic MSN evaluation is required.
