This MESL complements AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting.
It applies to all Air Combat Command (ACC) RQ-4B units, including deployed locations. This
supplement does not apply to the Air National Guard (ARG) and Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC). For the purpose of this instruction and development of maintenance policy, the Lead
Command is Air Combat Command. As it pertains to weapon system specific issues or
requirements, AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and Responsibilities for Weapon
Systems takes precedence. This publication may not be supplemented or further implemented or

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Specifically the
Mission columns have been changed. Numerous systems Work Unit Codes (WUCs) have been
added or deleted. Remarks are incorporated for each applicable WUC and have replaced notes to
better clarify mission capability requirements.
1. Roles and Responsibilities.
     1.1. The Production Superintendent with input from the Aircraft Operator and Sensor
     Operator will determine appropriate status prior to reporting.
2. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the
groundwork for reporting aircraft availability status. MESLs list the minimum essential systems
and subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime,
training, test or other missions. MESLs are not comprehensive WUC lists and not intended to
mirror Minimum Equipment Lists. Use Mission Ready Available (MRA) in readiness Status of
Resources and Training System (SORTS) reporting only, and it denotes Mission Capable (MC)
aircraft capable of configuration for a contingency mission IAW COMACC OMNIBUS Plan.
     2.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex
     degraded mission systems.
     2.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
     Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC.
     A Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may deploy provided it is safe for flight and can be
     configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
     2.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
     Command (MAJCOM) differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to
     another MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and
     specify the unit's requirements and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
3. Reading the MESL. Read a MESL by comparing the systems stated by WUC against the
Full System List (FSL) and all applicable Basic System Lists (BSLs) across the page. Each
unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines applicability of BSL columns.
The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft; therefore, it is important to compare
only those columns listed in the MESL that are applicable to the unit's assigned aircraft. For
example, units with Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI) coded aircraft would determine
and report status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to their DOC statement. Units
with Primary Training Aircraft Inventory (PTAI) coded aircraft would determine and report
status using only the FSL and TNG columns, and units with Primary Development/Test Aircraft
Inventory (PDAI) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and Test
(TST) columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure reported status by using the
MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code. Note: Until a DOC
statement is published, utilize the FSL, RT and CT columns for determining aircraft status.

                                                      QUALIFYING NOTES:

 1. As required by AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground and AFI 11-202
V3, General Flight Rules.
 2. As required by airspace management authorities.

3. Aircrew will have direct (line-of-sight) or indirect (audio pass-through or A.M. relay) radio communication capability with air
traffic control. Based on mission criticality and the availability of alternate means of communication, operations may elect to fly
without this capability.
4. Aircraft must have operational C2 equipment capable of supporting two links for all portions of
all missions.
5. At least one broadband data link is required for each sensor mission.

6. If sensor payload can be operated/flown without damaging EISS, the aircraft is PMC if either SAR or EO/IR is operational.

7. When Installed and required for assigned mission.

8. Either SCAT-1 or OmniSTAR DGPS corrections are required for all taxi, takeoff & landing events.

9. Refer to attachment 2 for Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP) M/C criteria.

10. Refer to attachment 3 for Battlefield Airborne Communications Node (BACN) M/C criteria.

11. Refer to attachment 4 for Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Payload (MP-RTIP) M/C
Criteria.
12. Not Applicable on Block 20 BACN or Block 40 MP-RTIP.

13. NMC if ESEU Removed:
  - EERU does not get 28VDC, heaters are unpowered and EERU gets cold soaked during flight.
  - SAR Antenna has no gimbal drive control (provided by the ESEU) and is unusable.

A2.1. The table below, Table A2.1, applies to the Airborne Signals Intelligence Payload (ASIP)
components of the block 30M aircraft. The ASQ-230 is designed with Built–in-Test (BIT),
allowing the FSRs to evaluate the internal signals in all the ASIP LRUs, at the sub-WUC level.
System redundancy and a detailed fault isolation tree allow the operational unit to assess the
degradation of the ASQ-230 LRUs and provide recommendations based on mission
requirements. The number of receivers and processors available to the operator is normally in
excess of what is required for the mission. Any of the AN/ASQ-230(v) chassis can be degraded
and still be mission capable. Partial Mission Status can be extrapolated by column for the
desired system capability. “X” maps require subsystem to system function Non-operational
ASIP equipment not required for the mission/training does not render the aircraft non-flyable. If
sensor payload can be operated/flown without damaging either ASIP/EISS system, the aircraft is
PMC, given that one of the systems is operational. See RQ-4B MESL items 28 and 29.

                                                    QUALIFYING NOTES:
 1. Not applicable on Block 20 BACN or Block 40 MP-RTIP.
 2. PMC if EISS System, WUC 77A is NMC.
 3. PMC with one or more antennas can be lost. One antenna must remain operational to fully support the ASIP Low Band
 “collection” capability. One or more antennas can be degraded, non-functional, or removed. The number of blade antennas
 that are degraded affects the accuracy of the Low Band “DF/geo-location” capability. Under these conditions the ASIP
 System’s Low Band “DF/geo-location” capability is partially mission capable.
 4. PMC One of the antennas can be degraded, non-functional, or removed and replaced by ballast, and ASIP can continue to
 perform its High Band mission in a degraded status.
 5. SCC1 can be degraded and still full mission capable depending on Commander’s assessment of mission need.

 6. PMC if SSC2 is degraded, non-functional, or removed. The ASIP Low Band capability remains fully mission capable.
14                           AFI21-103_ACCSUP_ADDENDUM_MM 25 MARCH 2014


7. ACC3 can be degraded and still full mission capable depending on Commander’s assessment of mission need.
8. Aircraft ballast is not sufficient to allow the removal of two or more aft ASIP LRUs (ACC3, ACC4 and ACC5) at the same
time. Weight and balance computations are the driving factor whether a chassis should be removed.
9. PMC if ACC4 is degraded, non-functional, or removed. The High Band and the Low Band TAS capability will remain fully
mission capable.

10. PMC if ACC5 can be degraded, non-functional, or removed. The High Band capability will remain fully mission capable.
11. ACC6 can be degraded and still full mission capable depending on Commander’s assessment of mission need.
