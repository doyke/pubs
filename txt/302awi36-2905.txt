       Well training when Active Duty Air Force Health and Wellness Center (HAWC)
       education and intervention programs are not available or accessible.
       1.4.5. The UFPM shall assist the EP or WFPM with any inspection conducted on the
       unit’s fitness program.
       1.4.6. Once a Unit Commander (and only the Unit Commander) exempts a member via

       mail with the following information: Member's full SSN, Member's Height, Member's
       Weight, Type of Exemption: Deployment, Commander, Medical, Pregnancy; and the
       duration of deployment. The UFPM must include the Unit Commander in the e-mail sent
       to the FAC. When sending the e-mail about an exemption to the FAC, it is critical to
       encrypt it because the e-mail contains Privacy Act information. The FAC will input the
       exemption information into Air Force Fitness Management System (AFFMS). Note:
       Please refer to AFI33-332, para. 2.2.5 for correct PII emailing procedures.
       1.4.7. UFPM’s should regularly monitor the 302 AW FAC PTL Augmentee Schedule to
       ensure their assigned PTL reports for their assigned duty at the FAC.
       1.4.8. If no PTLs are available in their unit, the UFPM will find an alternate PTL from

       a copy of the FSQ to the UFPM and FAC.
       1.6.3. Upon completing the FSQ, if a medical condition exists or arises prior to the
       scheduled FA, which would restrict the completion of their fitness requirements, the
       member needs to notify their UFPM and follow the 302 AW Fitness Profile Flow Chart
       (Attachment 7). The member must provide a copy of the civilian medical documentation
       (Attachment 6) to the UFPM and 302 ASTS in order to schedule an appointment with

      member can provide medical documentation from their civilian physician that supports
      the illness/injury.
      1.6.5. If the member sustains and injury during the test, they must report that injury to
      the FAC staff immediately and follow the process outlined in in the 302 AW Injury

   of the test before the strength portion if they desire. Members must notify the FAC personnel
   of their intent before the test.
   2.4. Members that commute from an altitude lower than 5,250 feet, may request approval
   from the 302 AW/CC to test at an active duty base at or near their home altitude. The base

   copy of the results to the member’s UFPM. (Attachment 13)
3. Unsatisfactory FA Scores.
   3.1. Members will notify their supervisor and UFPM of unsatisfactory test results or failure
   to meet requirements; the FAC will generate an AF 108. Within 60 days of the unsatisfactory
   test the member must produce a certificate for completing the online Be Well session
   available through Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS) and turn into their units
   UFPM. If the member is unable to start within 10 days, a written authorization from the unit
   commander must be obtained and given to the UFPM. Members that receive consecutive
   unsatisfactory test results are required to re-enroll in the Be Well program for each failure.
   3.2. The FAC will send an email to the member’s Unit Commander and the UFPM notifying
   them of the unsatisfactory score.
 6                                                           302AWI36-2905 19 AUGUST 2014


     3.3. Scorecards will be forwarded to the UFPM via email by the FAC and maintained for
     two years in the member’s Fitness Case File (6 Part Folder).
4. Adverse Personnel Actions (for Unsatisfactory Fitness Members).
     4.1. Members must comply with Air Force fitness standards at all times. When members
     fail to comply with the standards they render themselves to administrative action.
     4.2. Unit Commanders must evaluate the appropriate level of administrative action upon a
     member’s Unsatisfactory fitness score. Commanders may consult with the 302d Staff Judge
     Advocate before taking any action.
        4.2.1. Formal Schools: The reporting instructions for the requested school will define
        the fitness requirements. Commander’s should consider the overall fitness history of
        members prior to approving attendance at formal schools. Many formal schools require
        participation in daily physical training while at the training course. A copy of the fitness
        history score sheet will accompany every application package.
        4.2.2. EPRs/OPRs: The Rater must comment on the Ratee who does not meet physical
        fitness standards per AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems, and should
        contact the FSS for further guidance on referral evaluations. The Unit Commander has
        the option to request an extension of an evaluation for fitness not to exceed 59 days. The
        airman can test within this 59-day window.
        4.2.3. Deployments: Unit Commanders should not recommend someone for a voluntary
        deployment unless they have a passing fitness score. The gaining Combatant Command
        will define the fitness requirements in the reporting instructions for either voluntary
        deployments or involuntary mobilizations.
        4.2.4. Temporary Duty (TDY): Unit Commanders should take into consideration
        mission requirements and leadership expectations before sending an airman TDY with an
        Unsatisfactory fitness score.
        4.2.5. Awards and Decorations: Unit Commanders should not consider a member for
        an award and decoration while they do not meet fitness standards. Exception: Retirement
        decorations should consider the airman’s total service contribution during their career.
        4.2.6. Non-Current Airmen: Unit Commanders may place participating airmen who are
        non-current over 60 days for fitness testing in a No-Pay/No-Points status (Attachment 9).
        Every effort must be made to ensure airmen understand this restriction and resultant
        ramifications. Airmen will remain in a No-Pay/No-Points status until which time they
        report for duty to accomplish their FA. Airmen will be placed into an appropriate pay
        status prior to completing their FA. New accessions to the unit will have two consecutive
        UTAs from their in-processing date to complete the FA. (Example: Member arrives July
        UTA and in processes, they must test NLT Sept UTA). Unit commanders will handle
        each exception on a case-by-case basis.
5. Fitness Program Case Files.
     5.1. When a member of the 302 AW has four unsatisfactory fitness scores in a 24 month
     period, Unit Commanders will submit a retention or discharge recommendation within 30
     days or one (1) UTA, to the 302 AW/CC utilizing documentation from the Member’s Fitness
     Case File.
302AWI36-2905 19 AUGUST 2014                                                                  7


     5.1.1. The 24-month period is calculated from the most current Unsatisfactory score on a
     FA. The period is not reset if a member passes a FA after a previous Unsatisfactory
     fitness score.
     5.1.2. If a Unit Commander recommends retention, include all supporting documentation
     from the case file to justify the retention. The Unit Commander shall prepare a retention
     recommendation letter (Attachment 10). The retention recommendation package will
     process through the respective chain of command. If the 302 AW/CC supports the
     recommendation, the UFPM will retain the package at the unit.
     5.1.3. If a Unit Commander recommends discharge, include all supporting
     documentation from the case file to justify the discharge with the recommendation letter
     (Attachment 11). It is imperative that all copies of communication (letters, email, etc.)
     between the member and the Unit Commander are included to fully support the discharge
     recommendation. The Unit Commander must ensure the member’s medical record have
     been evaluated by the 302 ASTS prior to the recommendation (Attachment 3). If the
     Unit Commander requests a face-to-face medical evaluation, they will coordinate the
     event with the 302 ASTS.
  5.2. Member’s Fitness Case File (6 Part Folder)
     5.2.1. Content requirements (Attachment 12).
     5.2.2. Case files will be kept locked in an approved storage location (filing cabinet) when
     not being reviewed.
