4. Accountability/Reconciliation, Weapons Expediters will:
   4.1. Document expenditures on AF Form 2434s and update CAS between aircraft go’s. A
   copy of the AF Form 2434s will be provided to Munitions Control prior to aircraft
   consecutive go’s.
   4.2. Document first go’s line walk on AF Form 2434s and send to Munitions Control prior to
   aircraft take off.
   4.3. Document expenditure(s) and end of day line walk on an AF Form 2434 respectively
   and send to Munitions Control within two hours of last down time.
   4.4. Document consecutive go expenditure(s) on an AF Form 2434 and send to Munitions
   Control prior to clearing reconciliation. Any supplementary or subtracting of sorties will
   follow the same instruction.
   4.5. Once all aircraft have cleared reconciliation and an AF Form 2434 for the day has been
   sent to Munitions Control and validated, the next day munitions assets may be delivered.
   4.6. Munitions and Weapons personnel will work jointly to clear up all discrepancies and
   maintain accurate accountability of expenditures. The corresponding quantity of accountable
   safing gear (i.e. BDU-33 safing blocks) and expended impulse cartridges will be turned in for
   that days expenditures. See paragraph 5 for discrepancies that cannot be resolved.
NOTE: Munitions will not be delivered in anticipation of an approved AF Form 2407 without
prior 49th Maintenance Group Commander (49MXG/CC) approval. The Maintenance
Superintendent or equivalent will relay changes via AF Form 2407 to Munitions Control.
Munitions Control will be the final approval authority based on munitions availability.
   4.7. BDU-33 safing blocks (C-Block) and impulse cartridges are accountable items. One C-
   Block and streamer must be returned for each BDU-33 expended during reconciliation. The
   quantity of impulse cartridges will be collected for each munitions type listed below.

                                                      ARD-446                      1
   4.8. Any safing gear or expended impulse cartridges not accounted for at the end of flying
   will be reported as a lost object by the Weapons Expeditor in accordance with Holloman
   AFB Instruction (HAFBI) 21-37, Foreign Object Debris/Damage Prevention Program.
5. Reconciliation discrepancy procedures:
   5.1. Munitions Control will notify the Munitions On-Duty Superintendent of unresolved
   reconciliation discrepancies. Munitions On-Duty supervision will interface with AMU
   weapons supervision and attempt to resolve the discrepancy if Munitions Control and the
   MASO are unable. The Munitions On-Duty supervision and AMU weapons supervision will
   attempt to determine if the disparity is due to an error in reporting, documentation, or
   physical loss. Munitions personnel and Weapons Expediter will double check math and
 6                                              HOLLOMANAFBI21-201 9 OCTOBER 2014


     ensure all paperwork is accurate to include performing a physical inventory of the items in
     question.
     5.2. If it is determined a munition item has been physically lost, the responsible AMU will
     initiate a lost item report in accordance with HAFBI 21-37.
     5.3. Munitions Control will document the actions taken to resolve the discrepancy and
     munitions delivery may resume when cleared by the On-Duty Munitions supervisor.
NOTE: Munitions delivery may continue to the affected AMU for all other munitions not
involved in the reconciliation discrepancy. Example: If the BDU-33 count cannot be reconciled,
chaff/flare, 20mm and any other support may continue. BDU-33 support will remain suspended
until the above steps are completed.
6. Munitions Expenditures:
     6.1. All munitions expenditures will be processed in CAS IAW AFI 21-201, Chapter 7.
     6.2. CAS expenditures will be completed by the responsible functional area. Example:
     Weapons Expeditors will process WSN assets i.e. bombs, rockets, and impulse carts.
     Conventional Maintenance will process countermeasures and ammunition (i.e. chaff/flare
     and 20mm).
     6.3. If unable to reconcile all expenditures, contact the appropriate functional area(s) to
     investigate the problem and determine if the disparity is due to an error in reporting,
     documentation or physical loss.
     6.4. If munitions are over or erroneously expended, Reverse Post (RVP) actions are required.
     The respective Weapons Section Chief or equivalent will send the completed Memorandum
     for Record (MFR) and supporting documents to Munitions Control for verification prior to
     Munitions Operations processing the transaction. Supporting documents will include but are
     not limited to; erroneous AF Form 2434, corrected AF Form 2434 and MFR for RVP.
