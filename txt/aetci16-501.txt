1. Overview.
     1.1. The AETC Corporate Structure embodies the corporate review process for HQ AETC.
     This structure is designed to increase management effectiveness and improve cross-
     functional decision-making by providing a forum where senior AETC leaders can apply their
     collective judgment and experience to affect major programs, objectives, and issues with
     resourcing and/or policy decisions requiring the experience/expertise of the staff as a whole
     or decisions impacting the majority of the Command and/or its missions. Decisions should
     be made at the lowest possible level of the Corporate Structure. However, Program
     Objective Memorandum (POM) and Execution Plans will go through the Corporate Structure
     to the Council for final decision.
     1.2. The AETC Corporate Structure is illustrated at Attachment 2 and consists of a Council,
     Board and Group fed by Panels and Standing Committees with processes managed by
     A5/8/9. These bodies will meet on a pre-determined schedule which will be prominent on
     the AETC Corporate Structure Share-point. Attachment 3 is a draft annual calendar with
     anticipated agendas for each event. The "business practices" section of the AETC Corporate
     Structure Share-point contains detailed checklists for the coordination required for a meeting,
     getting on the agenda, minutes, etc. and will be the one-stop place for Action Officers (AO)
     and leadership alike to engage with, and participate in, the AETC Corporate Structure.
2. Composition. The AETC Corporate Structure is composed of several formal executive
bodies chartered to develop command positions on key issues. While the AETC/CC owns the
Corporate Structure, A5/8/9 manages Corporate Structure activities on his/her behalf
(Attachment 2).
3. Organization.
     3.1. The AETC Corporate Structure is comprised of the AETC Council, AETC Board,
     AETC Group, Panels, and Committees.
     3.2. The AETC Corporate Structure Secretariat resides in AETC/A8PP and provides
     oversight for all Corporate Structure activities (paragraph 9).
     3.3. Issues are sequentially elevated through the AETC Corporate Structure as illustrated at
     Attachment 2 (that is, issues start at the panel and/or committee and proceed through the
     Group, Board, and Council levels). However, decisions will be made at the lowest possible
     level of the Corporate Structure.
     3.4. The AETC Corporate Structure Share-point contains detailed business practices
     including required staff coordination for Corporate Structure issues and rules of engagement
     for the conduct of Corporate Structure events.
     3.5. Strategic information technology (IT) direction and decisions related to the entire AETC
     IT Portfolio must be vetted through the IT Committee, co-chaired by A6 and A5T. All
     command IT requirements, as defined by the Clinger Cohen Act of 1996 (CCA) Section
     5002, must be vetted through local Communications Squadrons and/or the HQ AETC/A6
     requirements process to be prioritized by the IT Panel, chaired by the A6, for resourcing
     recommendation within that panel and as input to other mission resourcing panels. A
     consolidated and prioritized AETC IT requirements list will be forwarded as advisement to
     the corporate process for resourcing consideration
AETCI16-501 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                 3


4. AETC Council.
   4.1. The AETC Council is a forum for the Command's most senior leaders to review and
   discuss resource issues and policy requirements received from the AETC Board and provide
   a recommendation to the AETC/CC. The AETC/CC (CV in his/her absence) presides over
   the Council.
   4.2. AETC Council membership consists of Directors from: AETC/A1, A2/3/10, A4/7,
   A5/8/9, A6, FM, IA, as well as AU/CC and RS/CC. Advisors to the AETC Council are: 2
   AF/CC and Directors (or equivalents) from CCL, HC, HO, IG, IP, JA, PA, PK, SG, SE, CG,
   and RF. When the principal is unavailable, the respective Deputy will normally attend in
   his/her absence. Other attendees are at the discretion of the AETC/CC (or CV).
   4.3. The AETC Corporate Structure Secretariat will manage agendas, action item
   release/tracking, scheduling and documentation. However, the OPR for particular agenda
   items being reviewed by the Council is ultimately responsible for the coordination,
   preparation, and presentation of agenda items in accordance with Corporate Structure
   business rules.
5. AETC Board.
   5.1. The AETC Board is a forum for the Command's Deputy Directors and Vice
   Commanders to review and discuss resource issues and policy requirements received from
   the AETC Group and make decisions when possible. If the Board Chair determines the
   authority for a decision does not belong at the Board level or the Board cannot achieve
   resolution, the Board will forward recommendations to the AETC Council. The
   AETC/A5/8/9 and AETC/FM co-chair the AETC Board. AETC Board decisions will be
   documented in minutes and published on the AETC Corporate Structure Share-point.
   5.2. AETC Board membership consists of Deputy Directors from: AETC/A1, A2/3/10-FT,
   A2/3/10-TT, A4/7, A5/8/9, A6, FM, IA, as well as AU/CV and RS/CV. Advisors to the
   AETC Board are: 2 AF/CV and Directors (or equivalents) from CCL, HC, HO, IG, IP, JA,
   PA, PK, SG, SE, CG, and RF. To promote the best decision possible on the
   effective/efficient use of AETC resources, Board members are charged with providing an
   enterprise viewpoint in addition to his/her functional expertise. When the Deputy is
   unavailable, their organization will send a substitute authorized to speak on behalf of the
   respective organization. Other attendees are at the discretion of the co-chairs.
   5.3. The AETC Corporate Structure Secretariat will manage agendas, action item
   release/tracking and scheduling. However, the OPR for particular agenda items being
   reviewed by the Board is ultimately responsible for the coordination, preparation, and
   presentation of agenda items in accordance with Corporate Structure business rules.
6. AETC Group.
   6.1. The AETC Group is a forum for the Command's O-6s/GS-15s to review and discuss
   resource issues and policy requirements received from the Panels/Committees and make
   decisions when possible. It is the first level of the Corporate Structure tasked to ensure
   cross-functional integration of AETC mission and mission support areas into a balanced
   AETC program and enables issue prioritizations when necessary. If the Group Chair
   determines the authority for a decision does not belong at the Group level or the Group
 4                                                            AETCI16-501 21 OCTOBER 2013


     cannot achieve resolution, the Group will forward recommendations to the AETC Board.
     The AETC/A8P and FMA co-chair the AETC Group. AETC Group decisions will be
     documented in minutes and published on the AETC Corporate Structure Share-point.
     6.2. AETC Group membership consists of Division Chiefs (or equivalents) from:
     AETC/A1R, A3F, A3T, A4P, A5R, A6X, A7N, IAO, as well as AU/DS and RSX. Advisors
     to the AETC Group are: representatives from A1M, 2AF/TTOC, CCL, HC, HO, IG, IP, JA,
     PA, PK, SG, SE, CG, RF and Panel Chairs. To promote the best decision possible on the
     effective/efficient use of AETC resources, Group members are charged with providing an
     enterprise viewpoint in addition to their function expertise. When the designated Group
     member is unavailable, the Directorate/Command will send a substitute authorized to speak
     on behalf of the respective organization. Other attendees are at the discretion of the co-
     chairs.
     6.3. In addition to resource/policy issues, the Panels/Committees can bring forward other
     issues at the discretion of the co-chairs. The process to establish agenda items for the AETC
     Group is covered in business practices on the AETC Corporate Structure Share-point.
     6.4. The AETC Corporate Structure Secretariat will manage agendas, action item
     release/tracking and scheduling. However, the OPR for particular agenda items being
     reviewed by the Group is ultimately responsible for the coordination, preparation, and
     presentation of agenda items in accordance with Corporate Structure business rules.
7. Panels.
     7.1. Panels review and screen resource allocation issues covering major AETC mission and
     mission support areas. Standing Panels are: Training (flying and technical), Education,
     Recruiting, Installation Support, Support, Information Technology (formerly Comm and
     Info), and Medical (see Attachment 2). Medical Panel resources are programmed and
     budgeted through a special Office of the Secretary of Defense appropriation but medical
     manpower is part of AETC's total obligation authority (TOA).
     7.2. Panels serve as initial points of entry for issues requiring corporate review. Panels have
     specific program elements assigned to them. Panels review and develop options for
     presentation to the AETC Group. In addition, Panels ensure the resources for AETC
     programs are properly allocated, fully validated, and adequately justified. Each panel
     prioritizes its programs for presentation to the AETC Group, and determines the issues to be
     reviewed and prioritized.
     7.3. The appropriate Director or Chief of Special Staff designates the Panel Chair from
     within his/her particular functional area. (Note: HQ AETC/A4/7 appoints the Panel Chair
     for the Support and Installation Support Panels.) The Directorate also writes/coordinates the
     Panel's Charter which the AETC Corporate Structure Secretariat will post on the AETC
     Corporate Structure Share-point. The Charter format and content minimum is in the business
     practices of the Corporate Structure website.
     7.4. The Panel Chair determines Panel membership to include, as a minimum,
     representatives from appropriate functional staff elements and AETC/A1M, A8P, and FMA
     as advisors. The sponsoring Directorate prepares an appointment memorandum (see business
     practices of AETC Corporate website). Each Panel appoints an AO or Panel Secretariat from
AETCI16-501 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    5


   within the Panel Chair's Directorate or Special Staff to serve as focal point. The AO or Panel
   Secretariat will comply with paragraph 12.
8. Committees.
   8.1. Committees serve as initial points of entry for issues requiring corporate review and for
   specialized resource requirements (i.e. information technology) that provide common
   capability across multiple functional areas/panels. Committees review/prioritize issues and
   make presentations to the AETC Group. When working resource issues, Committees input
   through the respective Panel and advise the AETC Group. Standing Committees include:
   MILCON, Facilities (sustainability, restoration, modernization and demolition (SRMD)),
   Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) allocation, Transformation, Information
   Technology integration, Requirements Oversight, and Basing/TFI (see Attachment 2).
   8.2. If a new committee is required, the sponsoring Directorate writes/staffs a Committee
   charter, IAW business practices of AETC Corporate website after coordinating with A5/8/9.
      8.2.1. If short-term in nature, a Working Group may be created. Working Groups are ad
      hoc, short-term groups convened by a Panel/Committee for a specific issue.
   8.3. The appropriate Director/Chief of Special Staff designates the Committee Chair. The
   Directorate also writes/coordinates the Committee's Charter which the AETC Corporate
   Structure Secretariat will post on the AETC Corporate Structure Share-point. The Charter
   format and content minimum is in the business practices of the Corporate Structure website.
   8.4. The Committee Chair determines Committee membership but should include
   stakeholder Divisions/Special Staff from across AETC as a minimum. The sponsoring
   Directorate prepares an appointment memorandum (see business practices of AETC
   Corporate website). Each Committee appoints an AO or Committee Secretariat from within
   the Committee Chair's Directorate or Special Staff to serve as focal point. The AO or Panel
   Secretariat will comply with paragraph 1.
9. AETC Corporate Structure Secretariat (AETC/A8PP).
   9.1. The AETC Corporate Structure Secretariat is responsible for managing AETC
   Corporate Structure activities.
   9.2. Specific duties are incorporated on AETC Corporate Structure Share-point and include:

     and published IAW the business practices on the AETC Corporate Structure Share-point.
     (see also Attachment 3, AETC Corporate Structure Nominal Annual Calendar)
     10.2. The Board Co-Chairs will advise the CV of Board results and determine if the CV
     requires a Council pre-brief. If a pre-brief is directed, timing, conduct, read-aheads,
     attendance and coordination processes are located in the business practices on the AETC
     Corporate Structure Share-point.
     10.3. Corporate Structure meeting attendance. AETC Corporate Structure meetings
     normally take precedence over all other staff duties and to reduce the burden to train new
     members, should be the same person unless no longer possible (PCA, PCS, Separation,
     Retirement, etc.). Because topics could involve privileged information requiring candid
     discussion, attendance will normally be restricted to members for the respective Corporate-
     level. When authorized by the appropriate Chair, functional experts and program managers
     who directly support the issues being reviewed may attend.
     10.4. Read ahead materials. AOs will provide an electronic copy of briefing materials to the
     AETC Corporate Structure Secretariat IAW business practices on the AETC Corporate

     Item, the tasked organization authors the tasking in coordination with the AETC Corporate
     Structure Secretariat IAW business practices on the AETC Corporate Structure Share-point
     for publishing in TMT. When short turn around does not allow use of TMT, the tasked
     organization will support the Secretariat in ensuring tracking and completion of the Action
     Item (see business practices on the AETC Corporate Structure Share-point).
     10.6. Documentation. See business practices on the AETC Corporate Structure Share-point.
     10.7. Elevating Issues. When decisions are not appropriate at Board or Group, the
     respective Co-Chairs will determine the consensus of the members and elevate the issue to
     the next Corporate Structure level.
     10.8. Master AETC Corporate Structure membership rosters are maintained by the AETC
     Corporate Structure Secretariat IAW business practices on the AETC Corporate Structure
     Share-point. The Secretariat will send out a TMT tasking to the Directorates at least annually
     (usually September after summer turnover) to update the rosters and post new rosters to the
     AETC Corporate Structure Share-point.
AETCI16-501 21 OCTOBER 2013                                                                     7
