This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 14-2, Intelligence Rules and
Procedures, and is consistent with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 14-202, Volume 1, Intelligence
Training, AFI 14-202, Volume 2, Intelligence Standardization/Evaluation Program, and AFI 14-
202, Volume 3, General Intelligence Rules. This publication prescribes standard intelligence
procedures to be used by all personnel performing intelligence duties in contingency response
(CR) units. This publication applies to Regular Air Force (RegAF), Reserve and Air National
Guard (ANG) intelligence personnel supporting CR operations. The National Guard Bureau will
be considered functionally as a major command (MAJCOM) for the purposes of this publication.
Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule located in the Air Force
Records Information Management System. This AFI may be supplemented, but all supplements
must be coordinated with the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) prior to certification and
approval. Refer recommended changes to the OPR using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication. Route AF Forms 847 through the appropriate functional chain of
command. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are
identified with a tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement. See
AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, for a description of the authorities associated
with the tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the
appropriate tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the publication OPR for non-tiered
compliance items.

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. General.
     1.1.1. Scope. This volume outlines the procedures applicable to CR intelligence operations.
     With the complementary references cited, this volume prescribes standard operational
     procedures to be used by all CR intelligence personnel. These operational procedures are the
     minimum and can be supplemented by additional unit-level written guidance. Unit-level
     written guidance may expand these basic procedures, but in no case will they be less
     restrictive.
     1.1.2. References. The primary references for CR intelligence operations are AFI 14-2CR,
     Volume 1, Contingency Response Unit Intelligence Training, AFI 14-2CR, Volume 2,
     Contingency Response Unit Intelligence Evaluation Criteria, Air Force Tactics, Techniques
     and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-1.Threat Guide, Threat Reference Guide and Countertactics
     Manual, and this publication.
     1.1.3. Compliance. The Contingency Response (CR) Senior Intelligence Officer (SIO) will
     ensure compliance with Air Force and MAJCOM directives and procedures as well as special
     notices in the Intelligence Read File.
     1.1.4. CR SIO Defined. The Chief Wing Intelligence or SIO is defined as the highest-
     ranking Air Force officer holding the 14N3 or 14N4 Air Force Specialty Code or Series 0132
     Civilian serving in an Air Force Intelligence position. For CR purposes the SIO and the CR
     SIO are synonymous within a CR Wing (CRW). The CR IN is defined as the highest ranking
     Air Force Intelligence officer in a CR within a CRW. The CR SIO and the CR IN are
     synonymous in a CR not within a CRW.
1.2. Waivers. MAJCOM/A2s will courtesy-copy AMC/A2 regarding all waiver requests and
responses. AMC/A2 will notify AF/A2DF of significant trends in waiver requests if such
correspondence indicates the need to readdress existing policy and guidance.

training to all deployable unit-type codes. EIT will be coordinated with CR personnel and
leadership and with force protection organizations (e.g. Security Forces (SF), Air Force Office of
Special Investigations (AFOSI, etc.) as defined in AFI 14-119, Intelligence Support to Force
Protection. The Chief of Wing Intel may determine if other unit personnel require external
training and will modify training requirements as appropriate.
3.2. External Intelligence Training Program Management.

        para 3.2 of this instruction. (T-3)
        3.3.1.3. When available, FP IFTU graduate should be responsible for the management of
        the FPIT program. If the intelligence function is not part of the host unit, the tenet unit
        responsibilities in AFI 14-119 will be adhered to. (T-3)
     3.3.2. Threat Knowledge Training.
        3.3.2.1. Develop specific threat knowledge training objectives tailored to the CR, unit
        mission, local area, deployment base(s) and forward operating locations. Concentrate on
        threats in selected countries with the potential for direct unit involvement. Include
        examples of weapons employment tactics and ground forces tactics. (T-3)
        3.3.2.2. Provide inputs to the lead MAJCOM-developed master question file. (T-2)

        with other classified and unclassified publications such as Tactics Bulletins, Tactics
        Analysis Reports, Country Studies, etc.
     3.3.3. Collection & Reporting. Training should focus on wing/group essential elements of
     information (EEI) and items necessary to enable CR personnel to initiate crew-originated
     reports (e.g., Size, Activity, Location, Unit, Time, Equipment report) and familiarize them
     with the information requirements of the intelligence-generated intelligence report.
     3.3.4. Visual Recognition (VR) Training.
        3.3.4.1. Develop specific VR training objectives tailored to the CR, unit mission, base
        and forward operating locations. Ensure VR training includes ground equipment and
AFI14-2CRV3 17 January 2013                                                                 9


     airframes likely to be encountered in the unit-tasked area of responsibility including
     rotary and fixed-wing, as well as joint/allied assets.
     3.3.4.2. VR Training should teach CR personnel how to describe threats they encounter
     to assist intelligence personnel in positive identification.
     3.3.4.3. Include examples of weapons employment training to illustrate to CR personnel
     how threats might appear when employed (e.g., air bursts, muzzle flashes, etc.).
     3.3.4.4. When available, utilize Higher Headquarters (HHQ) developed VR training
     programs, CDs and web-based training materials.
  3.3.5. Personnel Recovery (PR) Operational Support.
     3.3.5.1. IAW AFI 16-1301, Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) Program,
     for units with an assigned SERE specialist (1T0X1), a SERE specialist will conduct PR
     operational support training.       Units without SERE personnel will coordinate a
     memorandum of agreement (MOA) with ALS and operations. This block may be
     omitted if intelligence personnel do not provide any PR operational support training to
     aircrew per the MOA.
     3.3.5.2. IAW AFI 16-1301, intelligence personnel providing PR operational support
     training must be graduates of the SERE Training course, S-V80-A. If intelligence
     personnel provide PR Operational Support per the MOA, address as a minimum:
     3.3.5.3. Provide PR external intelligence training in accordance with current 11-2 series
     instructions.
     3.3.5.4. Ensure operations plan (OPLAN)/concept plan specific information is
     incorporated into training to the maximum extent possible.
  3.3.6. Ensure the objectives for each EIT category are evaluated with a test. All personnel
  covered by the training plan will pass each test with a minimum score of 85%. (T-2)
