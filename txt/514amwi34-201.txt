Training Assemblies (UTA), Rescheduled UTAs (RUTA) and Additional Flying Training Periods

1. General Guidance:
   1.1. Government lodging, either on base or contract commercial, is authorized for reservists in Inac-
   tive Duty Training (IDT) status who perform duty at their unit of assignment and reside outside the
   designated lodging commuting distance of the installation. Commuting distance is based on the mem-
   bers Home of Record street address.
       1.1.1. The 514th AMW/CC annually defines the commuting area of 514th AMW personnel as des-
       ignated by 514th AMW/FM. Personnel living within the 50 mile radius or 1 hour driving time of
       McGuire AFB, NJ, are considered commuters and are not authorized unit paid lodging.
       1.1.2. The 514th AMW/CC annually defines the authorized contract quarters, Bulk Purchase
       Agreement (BPA) for off base lodging as designated by the 305 CONS.
       1.1.3. Personnel living outside the 50 mile radius or 1 hour driving time of McGuire AFB, NJ are
       considered non-commuters and authorized unit paid lodging. Unit commanders will endorse the
       wing commanders policy letter and return it to the 514th MSG/CC with an attached list identifying
       those members living outside the commuting area. NOTE: Exceptions for reasons of safety or
       mission accomplishment must be requested in writing prior to the day of arrival by the unit com-
       mander or senior ART. Approval must be obtained by the respective group commander and MSG/
       CC (Authorization for Special Lodging Entitlement letter, see Attachment 2). Each unit must pro-
       vide a copy of all approved exceptions to the 514th SVF prior to the day of arrival.

       1.1.4. Authorized unit paid lodging is provided on-base or in BPA hotels only. Members must be
       in IDT status for unit billed lodging; this includes UTAs, RUTAs, Equivalent Training (ET), and
       Additional Flying Training Periods (AFTP). Members on Annual Tour (AT), Special Tour, or
       School Tour will pay for their lodging and request reimbursement on a DD Form 1351-2, Travel
       Voucher or Subvoucher, regardless of their per diem status. Members who violate this policy and
       choose to not use a BPA hotel must pay for their own room.
       1.1.5. Unit members must call into the 514th AMW Automated Lodging Reservation System
       (ALRS) for the following transactions: to make his /her own UTA lodging reservations; to cancel
       a lodging reservation; and/or to review their current reservations. Lodging quarters for each 514th
       AMW Air Force Reserve member will be on a first-come, first-serve basis for both on- and
       off-base lodging. Members are authorized one night of lodging for each 8 hour IDT work day. For
       all other lodging requirements member will contact the McGuire AFB Lodging Office.
       1.1.6. The 514th SVF will coordinate reservations for all 514th AMW members using the Auto-
       mated Lodging Reservation System (ALRS) for both on-base and BPA hotels.
       1.1.7. Both officers and enlisted personnel are authorized single occupancy quarters. Officers in
       the grade of O-6 and above, and Chief Master Sergeants, will contact 305th AMW Protocol at
       609-754-2405 for DV suite reservations or use the ALRS for standard room reservations.
       1.1.8. If on-base quarters are not available, members will be assigned BPA contract quarters IAW
       AFI 32-6005, Unaccompanied Housing Management and the 514th AMW/CC policy letter on
       off-base lodging.
       1.1.9. Shift work personnel and members using commercial transportation requiring on-base
       quarters, will be identified by their Unit Lodging Monitor as an ‘On-Base Only’ room reservation
       category.
       1.1.10. The 514th AMW pays the lodging cost for members on UTA status using the basic, single
       member rate for on-base or BPA hotels off-base. If a member brings a guest or guests, he or she
       may be required to pay the additional amount for their guest(s). Family members or guests are not
       automatically approved to stay in a room with the reservist. If a member chooses to stay at a
       non-BPA hotel he/she must pay for the room charges.
           1.1.10.1. The member pays for any incidental charges incurred such as beverages, movies,
           phone use, etc. If a member fails to pay incidental charges, they will face disciplinary action by
           their unit commander.

   mander. An Exception to Lodging Entitlement Letter is required to be on-file for those within com-
   muting distance.
   2.5. Enlistment applicants who travel beyond the designated commuting area are authorized lodging.

3. Process:
   3.1. The individual reserve member who is authorized lodging must make, change, and cancel their
   own reservations for UTA lodging. To do so the member must call the 514th AMW Automated Lodg-
   ing Reservation System (ALRS).
      3.1.1. When making a reservation the unit member must call the toll free Automated Lodging
      Reservation System in order to receive a room reservation for UTA lodging. The ALRS voice
      prompt will request personal identification. Next, the member is prompted to make a reservation
      for the UTA, and asked for arrival and departure dates. A hotel or on-base lodging facility is
      offered, and once accepted, is assigned to the member. Finally, the reservation dates are repeated
      followed by an ALRS confirmation number. If ALRS encounters problems with the provided
      caller information and/or there are no rooms available, the caller is informed to contact the 514th
      SVF Air Reserve Technician.
      3.1.2. When canceling a reservation the unit member must call the toll free Automated Lodging
      Reservation System in order to cancel a room reservation for UTA lodging. It is the member’s
      responsibility to cancel their own room reservation prior to 1800 on the scheduled date of arrival.
   3.2. Reservations can be made at any time prior to the date of arrival. If a room reservation has not
   been made prior to the date of arrival, the member will be considered a walk-in and the room assign-
   ment will be provided by the 305th lodging office in coordination with the 514th SVF.
   3.3. The Wing Lodging Manager will assure all lodging reservations made in the ALRS are commu-
   nicated to the appropriate hotel or on-base lodging office.
   3.4. If a member’s reserved room is not used or cancelled, the member is considered a No-Show. Unit
   commanders are informed of all no-shows by the 514th SVF. After three no-shows, the individual will
   lose lodging privileges for a minimum of 6 months.
   3.5. Late check outs are not authorized. Rooms must be vacated by the scheduled time set at the lodg-
   ing location. Any member not vacating their room in a timely manner will be held financially respon-
   sible for any extra room charge.

4. Payment:
   4.1. The 514th Services ART receives all invoices, and will reconcile all discrepancies with the final
   lodging roster.
   4.2. Once reconciled, lodging invoices for both on- and off- base will be paid within 20 days of the
   invoice receipt.

    their reservations are considered no-shows) and walk-ins will be added to the ‘No Lodging’ letter after

    a minimum of 6 months. The member is personally responsible for obtaining and paying for their
    lodging, and will not be given a commercial quarter’s contract. Names will be removed from the ‘No
    Lodging’ list by the 514th SVF/CC after the six month period has expired unless otherwise notified by
    the unit, group or wing commander. Unit commanders are highly encouraged to counsel first- and sec-
    ond-time offenders in order to prevent loss of lodging privileges.
    6.2. Unit O&M accounts will be charged in order to cover no-show expenses.
    6.3. Members who violate this policy and choose to make UTA room reservations outside of the pre-
    scribed method (using the 514th ALRS) and use non-BPA hotels, must pay for their own room.
    6.4. Unit commanders should use the same graduated disciplinary action used when dealing with
    credit card misuse when a member’s name appears on the ‘No Lodging’ list. Additionally, it is incum-
    bent upon the squadron commander to impose further disciplinary action to include denial of unit-paid
    lodging to any reservist who continually abuses the system. Habitual no-shows, persons who do not
    make reservations, and persons who cause excessive lodging problems may be added to the ‘No
    Lodging’ list. Only the wing commander can reinstate UTA lodging privileges for habitual abusers.

  6.5. If a 514th AMW member has comments (positive or negative) about any aspect of on-base ser-
  vices rendered during the lodging process, he/she should immediately contact the 305th Services
  Lodging Front Desk. For off-base lodging, he/she should contact the 514th SVF ART. If a problem is
  not resolved to their satisfaction, the member should provide written documentation to their Unit
  Lodging Monitor and First Sergeant on an AF Form 3211. Once received, the Unit Lodging Monitor
  will forward the AF Form 3211 to the 514th SVF ART and/or 514th SVF/CC who, in turn, will contact
  the 305th Services Lodging Manager for resolution.
