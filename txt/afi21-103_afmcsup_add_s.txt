This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance, AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
Equipment Maintenance Management, and AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and
Utilization Reporting. It establishes policy and assigns responsibility to provide AFMC Test
Fleet aircraft status changes/updates in accordance with (IAW) current maintenance conditions
and the developed MDS specific mission essential subsystem list (MESL). This instruction
applies to all AFMC organizations that manage or perform maintenance on AFMC
owned/possessed aircraft regardless of Air Force Specialty Code. Ensure that all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule
(RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Send comments and
suggested improvements to this instruction on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication, to HQ AFMC/A4MM, 462 Chidlaw Road, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5006.

These MESLs complement AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting.
They apply to maintenance activities supporting AFMC test missions across AFMC.

1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW 21-103. MESLs lay the ground
work for reporting the status of assigned/possessed AFMC test fleet aircraft and equipment
 2                             AFI21-103_AFMCSUP_ADDENDUM_S 19 OCTOBER 2011


supporting AFMC test missions. They list the minimum essential systems and subsystems that
must work on test fleet aircraft to perform specifically assigned unit test, training or other
missions.
1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define system exceptions and help explain complex degraded
mission systems.
1.2. It is understood that any aircraft or support equipment system or subsystem may be
subjected to test or tested under a test scenario and/or are test dependent as directed by the test
mission director. If identified by test mission director, those systems or subsystems if not
already identified by qualifying notes must be operational to be considered FMC or PMC for that
mission.
2. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by WUC or UNS
column (column 2) against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List
(BSLs) across the page. Each unitâ€™s Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines
applicability of BSL columns. The aircraft or equipment MESLs incorporate all AFMC
assigned/possessed aircraft/equipment and therefore it is important to compare only the columns
listed in the MESL which are applicable to the units assigned/possessed aircraft. For example,
units with training (TF) coded aircraft would determine report status using only the FSL and
TNG columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is reported using the MESL
columns appropriate to the individual aircraft/equipment assignment code or type mission being
flown.

QUALIFYING NOTES
1. Determined by pilot; if deemed flyable, A/C is MC.
2. One may be operative provided bleed air is not used from side of failed light.
3. Flight limited to cabin altitude to 10,000 ft. or less.
4. One system must be operable.
5. As determined by mission (i.e. passenger carrying, oceanic flights, local procedures, etc).
6. AMT panel may be inoperative.
7. Eight (8) must be installed IAW flight manual and in serviceable condition.
8. If required by FAA/ICAO airspace.
9. One may be inoperative provided corresponding load-meter is monitored.
10. One may be inoperative provided corresponding AC Freq/Volt meter is monitored.
11. May be inoperative provided the flap travel is visually inspected prior to takeoff.
12. May be inoperative provided the tabs are visually checked in the neutral position prior to takeoff for full range operation.
13. May be inoperative for flight at and below 17000 ft. Not required for BD-04.
14. One may be inoperative unless operating on aviation gasoline above 20000 ft.
15. One may be inoperative provided other side is operational and amount of fuel on board can be established for intended flight.
16. May be inoperative provided proper operation of cross-feed system is checked prior to takeoff. Both fuel pressure lights must be
operative.
17. One may be inoperative provided fuel quantity gauges are operative.
18. One may be inoperative provided standby boost pump operation is ascertained using opposite light with cross-feed prior to engine
start. Standby Boost pump on side of failed light must be operated in flight to assure fuel pressure, should the engine driven boost
pump fail.
19. Not required if Aux Tank fuel not required.
20. May be inoperative provided MAIN quantity indicators are operational.
21. One per occupied seat.
22. AMT position required as mission dictates.
23. Required during icing conditions.
24. Annunciator may be inoperative provided manual ice vane controls are operational.
