                                           Chapter 1

                       MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND POLICY

1.1. Maintenance Concept. (See AFI 21-101, Paragraph 1.4)
     1.1.1. General Concept of Repair: The basic concept of aircraft repair is to perform repairs
     at the lowest level of maintenance, to the fullest extent possible, consistent with good
     management, quality assurance and by using good Operational Risk Management (ORM)
     concepts outlined in AFI 90-901 and AFPD 90-902. Unless aircraft TOD prohibits repair;
     use of general repair TOD, use of general maintenance TOs as outlined in T.O. 00-5-1, and
     repair cycle asset management as outlined in T.O. 00-20-3 should be used to pursue local
     repair.
     1.1.2. Maintenance Assistance Requests: Technical/maintenance assistance: advice,
     assistance, and training pertaining to installation, operation, and maintenance of equipment
     using currently authorized procedures; authorization for one-time, limited duration or
     permanent repairs beyond existing technical order (TO) procedures; authorization for limited
     use of non-listed substitutes to prevent work stoppage. On direction from the Production
     Superintendent, Action Requests (AR) are submitted to MXG/QA and FSR/ETS to the
     Technical Support Center (TSC) in the Field Information Network (FIN) system and
     distributed via email through the AR distribution list. Units submit a -107/AR in FIN IAW
     TO 00-25-107, Maintenance Assistance. (See AFI 21-101, Paragraph 1.4.1)
1.2. Use of Technical Orders (TO) and TO Supplements. (See AFI 21-101, Paragraph 1.6)
     1.2.1. All TO change requests will be accomplished via the Portable Maintenance Aids
     (PMA) option for Technical Order Change Request (TODCR) to include changes requested
     to PDF form technical orders. (See AFI 21-101, Paragraph 1.6.2.1)
1.3. Maintenance Information Systems (MIS). Integrated Maintenance Information System
(IMIS) is the maintenance information system of input for F-22 aircraft maintenance action(s);
however, IMDS remains the MIS of record and entry for PS&D inputs/actions. IMIS users and
managers will consider each MIS applicable when MIS is referenced throughout this and other
AFIs/T.Os. IMDS and IMIS will accurately reflect all F-22 maintenance actions. All personnel
documenting maintenance must have access to and be trained/qualified to use IMIS and IMDS.
IMIS integrates AFTO 781-series form equivalents and will be used IAW TO 00-20-1 and TO
00-20-2 to document maintenance on aircraft as required. (See AFI 21-101, Paragraph 1.12)
     1.3.1. Once equipment (e.g., AFE, AME, ejection seat, gun) is removed from the aircraft
     through IMIS, subsequent off equipment maintenance will be documented in IMDS until
     IMIS parts forms capability exists. The owning workcenter performing the off-equipment
     maintenance will have parts manager access and update IMIS with configuration
     management updates to the end item.
1.4. Electronic aircraft forms (e-forms): The F-22 operates with e-forms and e-TOs that are
utilized on remote PMAs, which must be docked/undocked (synchronized) with a squadron/base
level server; this ensures the master aircraft forms and T.O. data base are maintained.
Synchronization will be accomplished via an RF link between the PMA and the server where RF
infrastructure is available or through a physical dock/undock process.
AFI21-101_COMBATAIRFORCESUP_ADDENDUM_A 9 October 2012                                          5


  1.4.1. A review of current aircraft e-forms will be performed prior to performing
  maintenance tasks. Real time RF link updates will be accomplished before and after tasks
  are performed or if aircraft status is changed. In the event of a “comm-out” scenario,
  personnel will retrieve the latest e-forms from the main server by physically
  docking/undocking with the server at least two times per day for aircraft committed to the
  daily flying schedule and at least once daily for aircraft in prolonged maintenance
  docks/functions. Dock forms drive with the IMIS server prior to support section turn-in.
  1.4.2. During scenarios where RF communication connectivity is available, real time
  synchronization is required.
  1.4.3. During “comm-out” or RF unavailability conditions, each aircraft will have a
  dedicated PMA (aircraft e-forms drive) used for each aircraft to ensure adequate control of
  most current status/maintenance documentation. If in a “comm-out” scenario and an aircraft
  on the flying schedule is time constrained for hard dock/undock (e.g. quick turn), the aircraft
  expeditor or flightline supervisor will ensure aircraft e-forms, status and/or debrief actions
  are reconciled between undocked PMA and server work station to facilitate continued sortie
  generation of maintenance activities.

                                           SAFETY

2.1. Flightline Safety. (See AFI 21-101, Paragraph 2.8)
     2.1.1. All personnel will wear protective foot coverings (booties) when walking on any
     external surface of aircraft. Operational risk management must be used whenever wearing
     booties may not provide enough traction for the individual to work safely.
     2.1.2. Use of powered AGE inside of hangars is governed by facility construction and local
     directives.
2.2. Warning Tags. (See AFI 21-101, Paragraph 2.14)
     2.2.1. The tag is designed to preclude inadvertent system activation. The bottom portion of
     the AF Form 1492, Warning Tag, will remain attached. Use the electronic warning alerts
     within IMIS and annotate the tag number in the discrepancy narrative causing the warning
     condition.

        ADDITIONAL MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS AND PROGRAMS

14.1. Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP). (See AFI 21-101, Paragraph 14.6)
   14.1.1. Units will assign an ASIP Project Officer as the point of contact for the OEM, 673
   AESS/SYE and MAJCOM ASIP POC.
   14.1.2. The ASIP data collection for F-22 is transparent to maintainers. The autonomous
   nature of the aircraft systems does not require inputs or actions apart from routine downloads
   of the Crash Survivable Memory Unit and/or DTC. All data for Individual Aircraft Tracking
   (IAT) is performed by OEM and 673 AESS/SYE. (See AFI 21-101, Paragraph 14.6)
14.2. End-of-Runway (EOR) Inspection. (See AFI 21-101, Paragraph 14.13)
   14.2.1. Dearm will only be performed when aircraft is flying with a hot gun. (See AFI 21-
   101, Paragraph 14.13.5)
14.3. Red Ball Maintenance. (See AFI 21-101, Paragraph 14.30)
   14.3.1. Docking and un-docking of PMA is not required to release the aircraft for flight.
   14.3.2. For deployment launch out sorties, all red ball maintenance will be documented on
   AFTO Form 781Hs and 781As in accordance with TO 00-20-1. All off-station maintenance
   and red ball maintenance prior to launch will be documented on 781A and 781H forms IAW
   00-20-1. Upon arrival to the deployed or TDY location, annotate aircraft drive forms with
   maintenance actions accomplished during the deployment launch Red Ball maintenance.
14.4. IFF Mode IV Program. (See AFI 21-101, Paragraph 14.37)
   14.4.1. Aircrew commanded Mode IV interrogation/replies are adequate for 2 month
   requirement. Document valid Mode IV interrogation/replies in IMIS/IMDS. Invalid Mode
   IV responses require a pilot reported discrepancy/job control number creation.
14.5. Packaged Maintenance Plan (PMP) personnel
   14.5.1. The PMP maintenance management concept enables consolidating of scheduled
   maintenance requirements contained in T.O. 1F-22A-6-1 by programmed initial and
   recurring intervals of 300 hour increments for hourly controlled tasks. The prime contractor
   manages engineering inspection requirements through T.O. 1F-22A-6-1, providing periodic
   updates as required. Owning units load the requirements contained in T.O 1F-22A-6-1 into
   IMDS and utilize IMDS maintenance forecast and reporting functions to determine PMP
   content for each aircraft for the upcoming 300 hour interval. The intent of the 300 hour
   initial and recurring intervals is to mitigate LO break-in requirements to facilitate mandated
   inspections. All aircraft have initial/recurring 300-hour PMP events, however the scope of
   each event varies based on aircraft structural configuration and IAT integrity data analysis.
   Not all PMP events are LO intrusive, so it’s feasible for those PMP events to be
   accomplished during normal scheduled maintenance activities and not drive the need to
   schedule the aircraft down for multiple days.

                             F-22 OUTER MOLD LINE AUDIT

A2.1. The Low Observables Section is responsible to perform a Signature Assessment System
(SAS) and aircraft Outer Mold Line (OML) audit on each assigned aircraft annually. The audit
is used to confirm that damage defects entered in the SAS during daily OML inspections or
damages removed from SAS during routine maintenance provide for an accurate representation
of the LO system health. This can only be performed by physically matching aircraft damages
with the entries in SAS. Errors identified during the audit must be recorded in the audit
historical file and corrected in the SAS immediately. Any aircraft audit that results in a +15% or
-15% SAS margin deviation indicates a potential deficiency with the OML inspection process.
Maintenance supervisors with direct oversight of LO processes must ensure significant variances
are understood and corrective actions, e.g. training, additional QA oversight, process changes,
etc. immediately follow. Internal root cause analysis and corrective actions must be documented
for historical purposes any time an audit exceeds the margin percentages outlined above. Units
must also establish a local SAS management policy outlining the frequency of QA evaluations to
ensure SAS data for each aircraft is accurate. Note: There is an unacceptable risk to aircraft
radar cross section and aircraft survivability due to substandard maintenance practices or
inaccurate maintenance documentation into the SAS. Aircraft scheduled for an audit should be
identified during the monthly/weekly shared resources meeting.
   A2.1.1. All aircraft scheduled to support a Theater Security Package/contingency
   deployment must not have an audit due within 30 days of arriving at the deployed location.
A2.2. The SAS and OML audit historical files: The SAS and OML audit files will be
maintained for 5 years. Each audit file will include at a minimum:
   A2.2.1. Name of person/s performing the audit.
   A2.2.2. Date of audit.
   A2.2.3. Pre-audit SAS margin percentage using sector with the highest number.
   A2.2.4. Post-audit SAS margin percentage using sector with greatest change, except in the
   case where a decrease in margin is greater than an increase in any sector. Sector increases
   are always more critical than sector decreases.
   A2.2.5. Number of new damages identified.
   A2.2.6. Number of previously repaired damages not removed from SAS.
   A2.2.7. Number of duplicate entries identified.
   A2.2.8. Root cause and corrective action when post audit results in a +15% or -15% change.
   A2.2.9. An (Figure A2.1) will be created and used to monitor OML inspection compliance.

                          DAILY SAS REPORTING METRICS

A3.1. Fleet SAS margin numbers must be documented in a format similar to the chart below
(Figure A5.1). Key information includes SAS margin number for each aircraft, fleet SAS
average and number of aero only panels. Fleet SAS average reported must not include non-
possessed aircraft. This information must be disseminated within the wing MXG as required and
MAJCOM F-22 Weapon System Team at least daily.

                                 SAS CREEP DESCRIPTION

A4.1. The chart below (Figure A.4.1) shows a categorization approach to optimize maintenance
activities. It outlines three categories of damages, those with an impact greater than 20% (major
“spikes”), those between 2% and 20% (moderate “routine”) and those less than 2% (minor
“creep”). Post flight OML inspections accomplished by the crew chief and/or LO personnel
must identify any LO spike damages as soon as possible after flight if the aircraft is on the next
day flying schedule.

Figure A4.1. SAS Creep Description.




   A4.1.1. The damage definition/SAS creep metric must be used to establish a battle rhythm
   for managing LO maintenance. Minor damages are repaired through scheduled SAS
   REDUX. Moderate damages should primarily be worked in groups in conjunction with other
   scheduled maintenance, e.g. Packaged Maintenance Plans, TCTOs, and panel removals to
   facilitate other maintenance. Any existing moderate damages should be the priority when
   performing scheduled SAS reduction efforts. Large damages driving significant increases in
   SAS must be fixed as soon as possible to manage SAS growth. In some cases it may be
   prudent to define large damages as >10 percent to effectively control SAS margins. This
   more aggressive approach is particularly beneficial prior to major deployments. Units have
   the option to define spikes as >10% if necessary to control spike growth, but the SAS creep
   definition provided above must be used in all cases.

  A4.1.2. Use wing analysis and scheduling experts to help balance flying operations and LO
  maintenance events/downtime to best manage LO fleet health. Failure to effectively balance
  flying and LO maintenance requirements could lead to an uncontrollable LO backlog.

                   CANOPY TRANSPARENCY COATING TRACKING

A5.1. Units will track canopy coating data in a format similar to the chart below (Figure A.5.1).
The tracking sheet must also include transparency manufacture and damage information by
placing a flag note in each block used to track canopy hours. This data is tracked to help units
predict reliability. Canopy data must be disseminated to MXG supervisors, MAJCOM weapon
system team and the LM canopy IPT at least weekly.

                               SAS MARGIN DEFINITION

A6.1. The graphic below (Figure A.6.1) depicts the SAS margin scale used to determine mission
capable status for the F-22 LO system.

Figure A6.1. SAS Margin Definition.




   A6.1.1. The LO margin for each aircraft is determined via OML inspection and use of SAS.
   An aircraft is fully mission capable for the LO system when the SAS margin is less than or
   equal to 100 percent. LO restoration is required when 100 percent SAS margin exceeded.
   A6.1.2. Manage fleet LO by taking advantage of opportunistic downtime or scheduling LO
   restoration time when RCS margin approaches unit determined threshold (typically around
   80%). Fleet SAS margin averages should be maintained at or below 60 percent during peace
   time operations to effectively manage SAS margin growth. Utilize a SAS top 5/10 priority
   list or SAS priority screen to schedule LO maintenance events. Any top 5/10 priority list
   must be kept current for other opportunities such as FOM work, aero-coated panel restoration
   if aircraft is down, complete concurrent spike and moderate damage repairs.
   A6.1.3. SAS does not rank-order aircraft in terms of RCS.
   A6.1.4. SAS number does not correlate to an RCS pattern.
   A6.1.5. SAS is not a mission planning tool.
