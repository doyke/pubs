           completion of any professional military education (PME) as well as awards earned
           during in-residence attendance. Include any off-duty education not directly related to
           primary duties; e.g., class, course, degree enrollment and/or completion, grade point
           average. Cite any other relevant training or activity that significantly enhanced the
           member’s value as a military citizen.
           7.3.2.3. Base and Community Involvement: Show how the nominee contributed to
           the military community’s welfare, morale, or status. Define the scope and impact of
           the member’s positive leadership and involvement in both the military and civilian
           community. Include leadership, membership, or participation in unit advisory
           councils, professional military organizations, associations, and events; e.g., President
           of Top 3, enlisted dining-out committee, member of Air Force Sergeants Association,
           Sunday school teacher, etc.
    7.4. Objective for Dormitory of the Quarter:
       7.4.1. To maintain a high standard of appearance and living conditions while creating
       multiple incentives for outstanding performance. To develop a sense of resident
       ownership, pride, and camaraderie while providing a platform for command level
       involvement within dormitories.
       7.4.2. The program is coordinated by the 718 CES Unaccompanied Housing, Airman
       Dorm Leaders (ADLs), and the Kadena First Sergeants Council. The competing dorms
       are selected by the First Sergeants Council based the recommendation of the ADLs.
KADENAABI36-2801 14 MAY 2014                                                                      9


     7.4.3. Participating dormitories are Buildings 141, 145, 149, 151, 176, 177, 613, 629,
     630, 700 and 758.
     7.4.4. Dorm of the Quarter. The first place winner will be awarded $2,000 and a trophy.
     The runner-up will receive $1,000. Monetary awards must be used for common area
     Quality of Life upgrades and will remain consistent only if wing funding allows.
         7.4.4.1. Dorm of the Year. The wing's dormitory of the year will receive a traveling
         trophy that they will proudly display for the following year.
         7.4.4.2. Trophies will be provided by 718th Civil Engineering Squadron, Housing
         Flight when funds are available. Alternatively, trophies may be funded by Kadena’s
         private organizations.
     7.4.5. Reference AFI 32-6005, PACAF Supplement, Unaccompanied Housing
     Management, for further details.
  7.5. Scoring of Packages: Board members will assign a score based on the “whole person
  concept.” Each board member scores each package using quarter-point increments (0, 1/4,
  1/2, 3/4, 1 point). Each line is worth a maximum of 1 point per bullet. Based on these
  scores, each board member rank orders their score sheet, (Kadena AB Form 80) from first to
  last and assigns a placing (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc.) to each nominee, then turns their score
  sheet to the Board President. The Board President reviews the score sheets and totals the
  rankings (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc.) for each nominee. The lowest overall total would be
  the overall winner (See Figure 7.1 for details).

Figure 7.1. Example Bullet Scoring

 Note: For the purpose of scoring the AF Forms 1206, a zero point bullet is the minimum
 valued point assessed to that specific bullet…do not confuse a zero point bullet as meaning
 the bullet is worthless. 0, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1 point valued bullets (weak, average, good, better, and
 best) are for scoring purposes only. Bullets should reflect “above and beyond” performance
 and not simply state what the member does in daily duties. Please consider the rank of the
 nominee when assessing points to the accomplishments…a zero point bullet for a MSgt may
 be a ½ bullet for an NCO, 1 point bullet for an Amn, etc. The ¼ and ¾ point increments are
 obviously used for bullets that are considered, average and better, respectively.

      Zero to ¼ point bullet example:

      -   Volunteered 2 hours with AADD over 4th of July weekend; assisted with the dispatching of
          3 drivers--key to zero DUI’s on base

 This bullet shows minimal involvement. The action of dispatching the drivers and the impact is
 questionable. The action may have still occurred/been prevented by the other dispatcher. The result
 is exaggerated considering the member only volunteered his/her service for 2 hours.

      ½ to ¾ point bullet example:

      -   Volunteered 12 hrs over 4th of July weekend; led AADD dispatch center--ensured safe
          home arrival for 28 Airman/averted potential DUI’s

 This bullet shows a deeper commitment and a broader personal sacrifice over an extended period.
 The accomplishment shows more of a leadership role. The impact is quantified and not exaggerated
 and is realistic to his/her accomplishment.

      1   point bullet example:

      -   Led AADD 3rd Qtr 12; filled 300 volunteer positions/60 drivers/ Dispatch Center
          team--ensured 156 safe rides/reduced DUI’s by 98% AADD utilization up 150%

 This bullet shows a high level of involvement and a leadership position over an extended period.
 The actions required significant coordination and involvement. The results show a correlation to
 his/her actions and a significant (positive) impact to the Wing.


   7.5.1. Bullets not meeting the intent of respective categories will be graded as “0” points.
   Example: Significant Self Improvement must be the nominee’s significant self
   improvements. Base and Community Involvement accomplishments in Leadership and
   Primary duties category would be considered not meeting the criteria of each category and be
   graded as “0” points. Reference paragraphs 7.3.2.1 thru 7.3.2.3 for examples of what each
   category should include.
KADENAABI36-2801 14 MAY 2014                                                                 11


      7.5.2. Bullets exceeding the mandatory line amount for respective categories will be
      discarded. Example: Significant Self Improvement category is 4 lines maximum, if
      category had 6 bullets, the 5th and 6th bullets would be discarded (do not choose 2
      bullets to discard, discard any bullets in excess of the maximum allowed).
      7.5.3. Failure to generate the required amount of lines for each heading (category) will
      negatively impact the score for the member. The maximum points any category can
      receive cannot exceed the maximum allowable lines for that respective category.
   7.6. For Civilian Categories I, II, and III the Selection Board will make selections for each
   civilian category using the following criteria:
      7.6.1. Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duty: Describe significant leadership
      accomplishments and how well the nominee performed assigned primary and additional
      duties.
      7.6.2. Significant Self-Improvement: Show how the nominee developed or improved
      skills related to primary duties, e.g., formal training, career development course
      enrollment or completion, on-the-job training, certifications, off-duty education.
      7.6.3. Base or Community Involvement: Include leadership, membership, or
      participation in unit advisory councils, professional military and/or local organizations,
      associations, religious organizations, etc.
      7.6.4. Voting: All board members will be voting members, however the Board
      President’s vote is only used in the event of a tie. The recorder and executive secretary
      positions are non-voting. The board members will convene at least one time as a group
      to discuss packages in person.
8. Recognition.
   8.1. Winners will be recognized at the Kadena Air Base Awards Ceremony (with the
   exception of the FGO category which is 18 WG only). All active duty winners will attend
   the quarterly awards ceremony in their uniform of the day (UOD).
   8.2. Reference 18 WG/CCC’s Kadena Air Base Quarterly and Annual Awards guide for
   conducting the awards ceremony (POC: 18 WG/CCCE).
   8.3. The 18 WG and PUG winners will be recognized at one ceremony. The Team Kadena
   awards ceremony will consist of the PUG awards presentation first, the 18 WG second, and
   the Team Kadena awards ceremony last.
      8.3.1. 18 WG will fund 18 WG award winners and PUG will fund PUG’s award winners.
      Team Kadena awards will be funded by the 18 WG.
   8.4. 18 WG Quarterly and annual award recipients will have their picture displayed on the
   Winners Board located at the 18 WG Headquarters building.
   8.5. Civilian records for the annual-level award winners will be updated through Defense
   Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS).
9. Relationship of Kadena Air Base Annual Recognition Program to Higher-Level Awards.
   9.1. The Kadena Air Base annual award recipients will be selected without regard to unit of
   assignment. However, in the event the Team Kadena award recipient is not assigned to 18
12                                                  KADENAABI36-2801 14 MAY 2014


  WG, the 18 WG nominee placing highest in each category will compete at the Numbered Air
  Force level under the Twelve Outstanding Airmen of the Year Program.
  9.2. Release of Results. Under no circumstances will base selection board results be
  released without the approval of 18th Wing Commander (18 WG/CC).
  9.3. The top 18 WG nominee in the Company Grade Officer of the Year will also be the 18
  WG nominee to compete at the Numbered Air Force level in their respective category.
