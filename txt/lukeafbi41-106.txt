    1.4. Program Coordinator.
       1.4.1. The program coordinator, is the Medical Group BLS Program Director. The
       program coordinator will oversee all AED training in conjunction with BLS training.
       This person provides training for wing BLS instructors. Additionally, the program
       coordinator provides PAD program training to the site coordinators and
       information/recommendations to the squadron commander or facility manager. The
       program coordinator works with site coordinators to help them resolve issues with their
       AED programs.
       1.4.2. The 56 MDG AED program coordinator or other designated individual will
       inspect AEDs quarterly. Inspection results will be provided to the Medical Director and

      1.5.5. Site Coordinators will provide a memo as required to 56 MDG/SGSE listing
      primary and alternate site coordinators to include: full name, rank, duty phone, e-mail
      address. (see Attachment 4).
      1.5.6. Site coordinators, in conjunction with section commanders, leadership,
      supervisors, will ensure that an emergency response plan is developed with the AED
      program coordinator. A sufficient number of personnel currently trained in CPR and
      AED use need to be on-duty when the facility is open for normal operations. A list of
      these personnel will be forwarded to the MDG AED program coordinator. Personnel call
      9-1-1 to obtain medical assistance.
      1.5.7. Site coordinators will be responsible for the operational checks when the facility is
      normally open for business and replenishing of expired or used items as needed. Success
      in this requirement is defined as 80% or greater inspections accomplished during a
      calendar month. Site coordinators will follow the procedure outlined in the AED Daily
      Checklist (Attachment 3). Site coordinators/work centers will maintain completed copies
      of the AED Daily Checklist for 2 years. After that time, they will be disposed IAW local
      procedures.
      1.5.8. Site coordinators will ensure AEDs are secured and accounted for.
   1.6. Targeted Responders or personnel trained in CPR and AED use. Targeted responders
   are personnel assigned to the work center where an AED is located and are trained in
   CPR/AED use. Military and civilian personnel are also trained in CPR/AED use and can be
   used to provide assistance as required. Personnel on Luke AFB are trained primarily in CPR
   through the Military Training Network/American Heart Association Guidelines. Personnel
   trained in BLS use the AED as required until Medical/Fire Emergency Services personnel
   arrive. Refresher training for targeted responders/ personnel trained in CPR is required
   biennially. Personnel will be trained on appropriate use of the AED found in their primary
   work center.
   1.7. Event Summary Sheet.
      1.7.1. An Event Summary Sheet (Attachment 2) will be completed by the site
      coordinator when the AED is used on a victim and forwarded to the Medical Director or
      designee by the next duty day after the event.
      1.7.2. After use, the AED will be brought to the Internal Medicine Clinic within 2 hours
      or by 0800 the next duty day. The internal memory of the AED will be downloaded and
      printed for inclusion in the patient’s medical records. The internal memory of the AED
      will then be cleared and the AED will be returned to the owning work center.
2. AED Locations.
   2.1. AEDs will be kept in conspicuous locations. The AED program coordinator provides,
   as required a list of PAD locations to the Luke AFB Fire Alarm Communications Center.
   2.2. Locations of AEDs on LAFB can be found by contacting 56 MDG/SGSE, DP 856-9133
   during normal duty hours.
3. Maintenance.

     3.1. If the AED is not functioning properly the device will be brought to the 56 MDG,
     Biomedical Equipment Maintenance Technician (BMET) flight, phone 856-7275. BMET is
     the focal point of maintenance and management of PAD program assets. A sign will be
     placed on the front of the AED storage location indicating the AED is out of service.
     (Attachment 5)
     3.2. If the unit is still under warranty, BMET will coordinate with the manufacturer, or
     designated dealer for unit repair. If the unit is no longer under warranty, BMET will
     determine if the unit can be repaired in-house or if the device should be sent to the
     manufacturer.
     3.3. All costs associated with the repair will be paid by the using activity. All repair actions
     and costs will be recorded by the Medical Logistics Flight. In accordance with the Safe
     Medical Devices Act, all equipment errors must be reported to the Food and Drug
     Administration (FDA). The reporting will be handled by the Medical Logistics Flight or
     BMET flight.
     3.4. Once an AED is purchased, BMET will perform an initial inspection of the device.
     During this process, the serial number, manufacturer and model number will be recorded to
     ensure that the AED is accounted for on the 56 MDG equipment inventory.
     3.5. BMET will perform annual preventive maintenance on all AED units in accordance
     with manufacturer’s specifications and guidelines.
4. New AED Service.
     4.1. Work centers requesting an AED will coordinate the request through their chain of
     command. The request will be sent in memorandum format to the 56 MDG, SGSE, AED
     Program Coordinator who staffs the request through the medical director and subsequently to
     the 56 MDG/CC for approval or disapproval. 56 MDG/CC makes recommendations to the
     56 FW/CC for deployment of new AEDs on LAFB.
     4.2. The Medical Logistics Flight will be the focal point for all AED acquisitions.
     Procurement of funding will be a unit responsibility.
     4.3. All AEDs will be gained on the 56 MDG equipment inventory. The item will be gained
     under the cost center (RC/CC) of the owning unit. Annually, the Medical Equipment
     Management Office (MEMO) will require AED owners to perform annual equipment
     inventories. In addition, MEMO performs scheduled preventive maintenance on all AEDs.
5. Standing Orders. Targeted responders or persons trained in BLS will perform initial on-
scene emergency resuscitation and appropriate age-specific use of the AED until relieved by
emergency services personnel, in accordance with American Heart Association, American Red
Cross or other nationally approved guidelines. Section personnel stand outside the building or
location and provide directions to responding emergency medical services personnel. Patients
with cardiac symptoms are to be kept where they are found or in a safe location and are not to be
transported to the 56 MDG, since emergency services are not available.
6. Emergency Services Coordination. Luke AFB emergency services personnel relieve
targeted responders from duty after arrival. Emergency services provide interim care until the
patient is transported to the appropriate off-base medical facility.

7. Quality Assurance. The medical director or designee will review all event summary sheets
to assess quality of care IAW DoD, Air Force and American Heart Association guidelines. In
turn the MDG Emergency Response Function will review the event summary sheet and
documents this review in the meeting minutes.
8. Recall of AEDs. AEDs will be subject to return to the 56 MDG when needed, for an event
such as LAFB Open House or local contingency situations. Such actions will be directed by the
56 FW/CC.
