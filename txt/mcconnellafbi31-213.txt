 8                                           MCCONNELLAFBI31-213 23 SEPTEMBER 2010


     Only the board president has the authority to commit the 22 ARW to providing funding for
     services provided.
     2.5.4. Records of board proceedings will be maintained by the board recorder as prescribed
     by records management policies.
2.6. Off–Limits Establishments and Areas
     2.6.1. The establishment of off–limits areas is a function of command. It may be used by 22
     ARW/CC to help maintain good order and discipline, health, morale, safety and welfare of
     personnel assigned to the 22 ARW. Off–limits action is also intended to prevent personnel
     from being exposed to or victimized by crime–conducive conditions. Where sufficient cause
     exists, the 22 ARW/CC retains substantial discretion to declare establishments or areas
     temporarily off–limits to personnel assigned to the 22 ARW. Temporary off–limits
     restrictions issued by the 22 ARW/CC in an emergency situation will be acted upon by the
     MDCB as a first priority. As a matter of policy, a change in ownership, management or
     name of any off–limits establishment does not, in and of itself, revoke the off–limits
     restriction.
     2.6.2. Military members assigned to McConnell AFB are prohibited from entering
     establishments or areas declared off–limits according to this regulation. Violations may
     subject the member to disciplinary action per applicable Air Force instructions and the
     Uniform Code of Military Justice. Family members of military personnel and others
     associated with the installation should be made aware of off–limits restrictions. As a general
     policy, these establishments will not be visited by personnel in a law enforcement capacity
     unless specifically determined by the 22 ARW/CC or board president that visits or
     surveillance is warranted.
     2.6.3. Except when emergency situations exist, prior to initiating an MDCB action, the 22
     ARW/CC or board president will attempt to correct adverse conditions or situations through
     the assistance of civic leaders or officials.
     2.6.4. Except when emergency situations exist, prior to recommending off–limits restriction,
     the MDCB will send a written notice (certified mail; return receipt requested) to the
     individual or firm responsible for the alleged condition or situation. In the notice, the MDCB
     will specify a reasonable time for the condition or situation to be corrected, along with the
     opportunity to present any relevant information to the board. If subsequent investigation
     reveals the responsible person has failed to take corrective action, the board will recommend
     the imposition of the off–limits restriction (see para 2.6.1.).
     2.6.5. A specified time limit will not be established when an off–limits restriction is invoked.
     The adequacy of the corrective action taken by the responsible individual will be the
     determining factor in removing an off–limits restriction.
     2.6.6. A person whose establishment or area has been declared off–limits may, at any time,
     petition the president of the board to remove the off–limits restriction. The petition will be in
     writing and will include a detailed report of action taken to eliminate the condition or
     situation that caused imposition of the restriction. The president of MDCB may direct an
     investigation to determine the status of corrective actions noted in the petition. The board
     will either recommend removal or continuation of the off–limits restriction to the board
     president based on the results of the investigation.

   2.6.7. Off–limits signs will not be posted on civilian establishments by US military
   authorities.
2.7. Meetings
   2.7.1. The board will meet quarterly. The president of the board may specify whether the
   meetings will be open or closed. Normally proceedings are closed, but may be opened to the
   public when circumstances warrant.
   2.7.2. Special meetings may be called by the president of the board. Except by unanimous
   consent of members present, final action will be taken only on the business for which the
   meeting was called.
   2.7.3. A majority of voting members constitutes a quorum for board proceedings.
2.8. MDCB
   2.8.1. Voting members will be selected per paragraph 2.2.1.1.
2.9. Attendance of Observers or Witnesses

   2.10.2. The board will immediately forward to the local commander reported circumstances
   involving discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion, age or national origin.
2.11. Off–Limits Procedures
   2.11.1. The decision tree (see Attachment 1) is an example of how the off-limits decision
   making process should occur. Off–limits restrictions should be invoked only when there is
   substantive information indicating an establishment or area frequented by 22 ARW personnel
   presents conditions which adversely affect their health, safety, welfare, morale or morals. It
   is essential the board does not act arbitrarily and actions must not be of a punitive nature.
   The board should work in close cooperation with local officials and proprietors of business
   establishments and seek to accomplish their mission through mutually cooperative efforts.
   The board should encourage personal visits by local military and civilian enforcement or
   health officials to establishments considered below standard. The MDCB should point out
   unhealthy conditions or undesirable practices to establishment owners or operators to
   produce the desired corrective action.
   2.11.2. In cases involving discrimination, the board should not rely solely on letters written
   by the Equal Opportunity Office and Military Affairs Committee or investigations of alleged
   racial discrimination.
   2.11.3. If the board decides to attempt to investigate or inspect an establishment, the
   president or a designee will prepare and submit a report of findings and recommendations at
   the next meeting. This procedure will ensure complete and documented information
   concerning questionable adverse conditions.
   2.11.4. When the board concludes that conditions are adverse to military members, the
   owner or manager will be sent a letter of notification (see Attachment 2). This letter will
   advise him or her to raise standards by a specified date and if such conditions or practices
   continue, off–limits proceedings will be initiated. Any correspondence with the individuals
   responsible for adverse conditions which may lead to off–limits action will be by certified
   mail.
   2.11.5. If a proprietor takes remedial action to correct undesirable conditions previously
   noted, the board should send a letter of appreciation (see Attachment 3) recognizing this
   cooperation.
   2.11.6. If undesirable conditions are not corrected, the proprietor will be invited to appear
   before the MDCB to explain why the establishment should not be placed off–limits (see
   Attachment 4). Any proprietor may designate, in writing, a representative to appear before
   the board on his or her behalf.
   2.11.7. In cases where proprietors have been invited to appear before the board, the president
   of the board will perform the following:
      2.11.7.1. Prior to calling the proprietor:
          2.11.7.1.1. Review the findings and decision of the previous meeting.
          2.11.7.1.2. Call for inspection reports.
          2.11.7.1.3. Allow those present to ask questions and discuss the case.
      2.11.7.2. When the proprietor or his or her representative is called before the board:
MCCONNELLAFBI31-213 23 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                       11


          2.11.7.2.1. Present the proprietor with a brief summary of the complaint concerning
          the establishment.
          2.11.7.2.2. Afford the proprietor an opportunity to present matters in defense.
          2.11.7.2.3. Invite those present to question the proprietor. After the questioning
          period, provide the proprietor an opportunity to make a final statement before being
          dismissed.
   2.11.8. Deliberations on recommended actions will be in closed session, attended only by
   board members.
   2.11.9. The board should recommend off–limits restriction only after the following:
      2.11.9.1. The letter of notification (see Attachment 2) has been sent.
      2.11.9.2. An opportunity for the proprietor to appear before the board has been extended.
      2.11.9.3. Further investigation indicates that improvements have not been made.
   2.11.10. The minutes will indicate the MDCB’s action in each case.            When a
   recommendation is made to place an establishment off–limits, the minutes will show the
   procedural steps followed in reaching the decision.
   2.11.11. Recommendations of the MDCB will be submitted to the 22 ARW/CC for approval.
   2.11.12. Upon approval of the MDCB’s recommendations, the president will write the
   proprietor that the off–limits restriction has been imposed (see Attachment 6).
   2.11.13. A time limit should not be specified when an off–limits restriction is imposed. The
   adequacy of the corrective action taken by the proprietor of the establishment must be the
   determining factor in removing the off–limits restriction.
   2.11.14. In emergencies, the 22 ARW/CC may temporarily declare establishments or areas
   off–limits to personnel assigned to the 22 ARW (see Attachment 7). The circumstances for
   the action will be reported as soon as possible to the MDCB. Detailed justification for this
   emergency action will be provided to the board for its deliberations.
   2.11.15. The MDCB will publish a list of off–limits establishments and areas using 22
   ARW/PA media channels or other available means to insure the widest possible
   dissemination.
2.12. Removal of Off–Limits Restrictions
   2.12.1. Removal of an off–limits restriction requires MDCB action and approval by the 22
   ARW/CC. Proprietors of establishments declared off–limits should be advised that they may
   petition the appropriate MDCB at any time. In their petition, they should submit the reason
   why the restriction should be removed. A letter of notification for continuance of the off–
   limits restriction should be sent to the proprietor, if the sponsoring commander does not
   remove the off–limits restriction (see Attachment 8). The proprietor may appeal to the next
   higher commander after exhausting all appeals at the local sponsoring commander level. The
   MDCB shall appoint a designee who should make at least quarterly inspections of off–limits
   establishments. A statement that an inspection has been completed should be included in
   MDCB minutes.
 12                                      MCCONNELLAFBI31-213 23 SEPTEMBER 2010


   2.12.2. When the board learns the proprietor has taken adequate corrective measures, the
   MDCB will take the following actions:
      2.12.2.1. Discuss the matter at the next meeting and make an appropriate
      recommendation.
      2.12.2.2. Forward a recommendation for removal of the off–limits restriction to the
      board president. If approved, a letter removing the restriction (see Attachment 9 or
      Attachment 10) will be sent to the proprietor.
      2.12.2.3. Reflect action taken in the minutes.
2.13. Minutes
   2.13.1. Minutes will be prepared by the board recorder in accordance with administrative
   formats for minutes of meetings prescribed by the sponsoring commander (see Attachment
   11). The written minutes of MDCB meetings will constitute the official record of the MDCB
   proceedings. Verbatim transcripts of board meetings are not required. The reasons for
   approving or removing an off–limits restriction, including a complete address of the
   establishment or area involved, should be indicated in the order of business. In addition, the
   MDCB’s action will be shown in the order or sequence of actions taken. A change in the
   name of an establishment or areas in an off–limits restriction will also be included.
   2.13.2. Distribution of the minutes of MDCB meetings will be limited to the following:
      2.13.2.1. Each voting member.
      2.13.2.2. Civilian and governmental agencies within the State of Kansas in which
      member installations are located having an official interest in the functions of the board,
