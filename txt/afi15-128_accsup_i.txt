     1.2.2.3. Tactical Level. AFW support to operational USAF and USA field units is organized for
     tactical, mission-specific operations. A CWT is a generic term used to describe a weather team
     that provides mission-tailored weather products and services to a supported unit in garrison or at a
     deployed location. For USAF operations, CWTs are normally organized as Weather Flights under
     Operations Support Squadrons. For US Army operations, CWTs are normally organized as
     Detachments or Weather Flights under Air Support Operations Squadrons and Combat Weather
     Squadrons under Air Support Operations Groups. Detachments supporting Army operations in the
     European theater are organized under the 7WS and Detachments supporting Army operations in
     the Korean theater are organized under the 607WS. During contingencies, CWTs deploy with
     operational warfighters. In addition, the 10CWS supports US Army Special Operations Command
     (USASOC), the 30WS supports the Western Missile Test Range, and the 45WS supports the East-
     ern Missile Test Range. Each has unique mission responsibilities. In addition, select weather field
     units perform unique space weather missions. Nonetheless, the CWT is the cornerstone of AFW
     support to operational field unit mission activities.

     tory and AFMC Product Centers and Test Centers. These personnel, collectively known as "staff
     meteorologists" or "staffmets", perform or support basic research and support the development, acqui-
     sition, and testing of AF weapon systems and capabilities by identifying, documenting, and helping
     resolve environmental sensitivity issues and weather support requirements. Two of the larger
     "staffmet" units are the 88WS at Wright-Patterson AFB OH, designated the staffmet hub, and the
     46WS at Eglin AFB, FL, which performs or supports basic research.

1.3. Utilization of AF Weather Personnel. Weather personnel provide critical products and services to
facilitate force protection decisions and execution of air and ground operations in peace and war. Tasking
or assigning weather personnel to non-weather duties conflicting with their primary duties degrades oper-
AFI15-128_ACCSUP1_I 9 MARCH 2005                                                                      13


ational decision-making processes. Commanders will avoid assigning weather personnel to non-weather
duties that conflict with primary duties and undermine mission effectiveness of the weather unit.
   1.3.1. Unit leadership will ensure personnel:
       1.3.1.1. Perform mission essential tasks.
       1.3.1.2. Shall not be designated as augmentees of other base/post functions that will detract from
       accomplishing the primary mission of the wing.
   1.3.2. Impact of “career broadening” on small weather units. Air Force Manpower Standard 34A1
   determines the manpower necessary to perform mission-critical functions by weather forces; actual
   manning is based on the worldwide average availability of weather officers and enlisted personnel and
   is normally less than the authorized whole. Release of 15W or 1W0X1A personnel for “career broad-
   ening” in non-weather duties (e.g., executive officer, First-term Airman’s Center Superintendent) may
   have a detrimental effect on the mission effectiveness of the weather unit. Commanders should con-
   sider the manning situation of the particular weather unit and weigh long-term impact on operations
   tempo and morale resulting from removal of personnel from their primary duties along with the bene-
   fit to the unit and individual of the “career broadening” opportunity.

                                    COMBAT WEATHER TEAMS

4.1. Roles: CWTs provide or arrange tactical-level weather support for assigned USAF and USA units
in-garrison and deployed. CWTs provide weather and solar observations and mission execution forecasts
(MEFs) for tactical and in-garrison operations. CWTs apply meteorology and space physics to the specific
needs of operational missions, translating terrestrial and space weather conditions into operational mis-
sion impacts. They interface with field commanders, planners, and operational personnel; they reach back
to an OWS for centralized weather products and then tailor the products into decision-grade environmen-
tal information for supported units.

4.2. Responsibilities: CWTs will:
   4.2.1. Take, record, and disseminate surface weather observations, when required, in support of mili-
   tary operations IAW AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations.
       4.2.1.1. Augment automated surface observing systems, when required IAW AFMAN 15-111.

       Limited Observing Program, Remote Miniature Weather System and storm reports (USASOC
       SAV SER SUP 6) back to the supporting OWS via appropriate means.
       4.2.1.3. CWTs will not take, record, or disseminate a separate observation if the NWS or a host
       nation is responsible for the official airfield observation, provided host nation weather observa-
       tions meet operational requirements.
           4.2.1.3.1. CWTs may supplement the official airfield observation with weather parameters not
           included in the observation (e.g., altimeter, SPECI criteria unique to AF/Army Operations).
           4.2.1.3.2. CWTs will document all supplemental support to the official airfield observation in
           local plans, annexes, or a stand-alone weather support document.
   4.2.2. Provide solar observations IAW AFWAI 15-2, Space Environmental Observations, Solar Opti-
   cal And Radio Observing, if equipped as a Solar Electro-Optical Network site. Disseminate solar
   observations to AFWA and appropriate agencies to provide space weather forecasts, warnings, and
   support.
   4.2.3. Provide upper air observations IAW FMH 3, Rawinsonde and Pibal Observations, if equipped
   with upper air observing equipment. Disseminate observations to AFWA and the appropriate OWS to
   supplement other upper air observations or provide observation in data-sparse regions.
   4.2.4. Provide MEFs for operational missions, including tenant organizations, as coordinated with
   customers.
       4.2.4.1. (Added-ACC) CWTs use TAFs for the takeoff, landing, and alternate airfield informa-
       tion for the MEF. The MEF takes into account takeoff and landing weather thresholds for specific
       aircraft, pilot categories or missions. The airfield forecast in the MEF must be within the same
       cloud ceiling and visibility forecast category as the TAF, except if flight safety is jeopardized and
       the TAF cannot be amended in time. The CWT must coordinate differences with the OWS issuing
       the TAF.

     watch (MISSIONWATCH) for host/parent unit operating areas, flying areas, routes, and flights
     throughout the course of a mission.
     4.2.8. Serve as the “eyes forward” for the OWS. Provide the OWS with real-time interpretation of
     local weather information, including data from local weather offices and weather spotters. Notify the
     OWS when forecasts require amendment based on established criteria. The CWT designates a single
     point of contact (i.e., airfield services element duty position) responsible for contacting and coordinat-
     ing with the OWS in the “eyes forward” role.
        4.2.8.1. Notify the OWS if weather events impacting flight safety occur, or are imminent, so that
        the OWS may amend the TAF-coded forecast product immediately.
        4.2.8.2. Issue a weather warning if weather imminently threatens life or property and there is
        insufficient time for the OWS to issue the weather warning. The CWT gives top priority to notify-
        ing the necessary units on the installation, followed immediately by notifying the OWS.
     4.2.9. Issue, amend, and cancel all observed weather advisories and observed lightning warnings for
     their location during CWT operating hours.
     4.2.10. Develop and implement Severe Weather Action Procedures.
     4.2.11. Develop and conduct a mission execution forecast process to tailor weather products for oper-
     ational users. For large force employment missions, with force packages from different locations, the
     weather unit supporting the Command and Control element will act as lead for planning purposes. The
     lead weather unit coordinates with all other weather units to ensure a coordinated and common
     weather forecast is available to build the MEFs to support the mission.

Terms
Combat Weather Team (CWT)—A weather unit that mission tailors operational and/or strategic level
weather products for an operational user. Combat Weather Teams provide decision-grade information on
environmental impacts to military operations for military decision-making processes. The unit may be
located with the supported unit on an Air Force base, Army post, remotely located in another weather unit,
or at a deployed location.
Meteorological Watch (METWATCH)—A deliberate process for monitoring the terrestrial weather or
space environment in an area or region. The purpose of a METWATCH is to identify when and where
observed conditions significantly diverge from forecast conditions and determine courses of action to
update or amend a forecast product or group of products and notify designated agencies. Strategic and
operational level weather units typically conduct METWATCH activities.
Mission Execution Forecast (MEF)—Mission-tailored environmental information describing a specific
impact to an operational mission. A mission execution forecast provides decision-grade environmental
information for military decision-making processes. CWTs and specialized weather teams conduct
deliberate forecast processes to develop, deliver, monitor, and amend mission execution forecasts by
fusing perishable data with operational and strategic level weather forecast products.
Military Operating Area Forecast—A forecast guidance product that provides the weather or space
environmental conditions for a specific area in which military operations are occurring.
MISSIONWATCH—A deliberate process for monitoring terrestrial weather or the space environment
for specific mission-limiting environmental factors. The MISSIONWATCH process is performed by
CWTs and is intended to identify and alert decision-makers at the operational unit to changes that impact
mission success.
Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)—A coded weather bulletin providing forecast information for an
aerodrome complex to facilitate flight planning and command and control. TAF products are formatted
IAW AFMAN 15-124 and amended IAW procedures specified in AFMAN 15-129.
Weather Advisory—A special weather product to alert an end user of the occurrence of, or imminent
occurrence of weather conditions impacting operations.
Weather Warning—A special weather product to facilitate force protection decisions. Weather Warnings
alert designated agencies to the imminent or actual occurrence of weather conditions of such intensity as
to pose a hazard to life or property for which the agency must take immediate protective actions.
Weather Watch—A special weather product to facilitate force protection decisions. Weather Watches
provide advance notice to designated agencies of the existence of a potential for weather conditions of
such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property for which the agency should consider taking
protective measures.
