                         SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS

1.1. Overview. The purpose of the Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) Program is to detect,
treat and provide education to patients infected with sexually transmitted infections in order to
break the chain of infection and prevent complications and/or chronic disease. Sexually
transmitted infections are identified in active duty and beneficiaries primarily through clinical
encounters, whereas, female basic trainees are actively screened for Chlamydia and Gonococcal
Infection (GC).
1.2. Responsibilities.
     1.2.1. Healthcare providers will:
        1.2.1.1. Diagnose and treat presumptive and confirmed STI CASES in accordance with
        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Sexually Transmitted Infections
        Treatment      Guidelines, 2010 (or most recent version when superseded).
        http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/default.htm
        1.2.1.2. Instruct patients to avoid intimate contact until 7 days after a single-dose
        regimen or after completion of a 7-day regimen for themselves AND for their contact(s).

                                            Chapter 2

                         RABIES EXPOSURE CONTROL PROGRAM

2.1. Overview. To outline responsibilities and post-exposure procedures in order to prevent
human rabies that may result from bite and non-bite exposures.
2.2. Responsibilities.
     2.2.1. Healthcare providers will refer all potential rabies exposures to include scratches,
     bites, contact of saliva with mucous membranes or non-intact skin, etc to the 59 MDW
     emergency department for wound management, rabies risk assessment, and initiation of post-
     exposure prophylaxis (PEP) when indicated.
     2.2.2. Treating Provider Will:
        2.2.2.1. Clinically manage all potential rabies exposures (bite and non-bite) to include
        scratches, bites, contact of saliva with mucous membranes or non-intact skin, etc.
        2.2.2.2. Render first aid to include cleansing the wound with soap and water due to the
        lipophilic nature of the rabies virus; when available, irrigates the wound with a virucidal
        agent such as a povidine-iodine solution.
        2.2.2.3. Complete the DD Form 2341, Report of Animal Bite - Potential Rabies
        Exposure, Part I and II and assesses the risk for rabies exposure. Risk for rabies exposure
        is based on the type of animal involved, type of contact, circumstances of the exposure,
        health status of the animal, the animal’s vaccination status, whether the animal is a stray
        and in the case of dogs and cats whether the animal is available for 10-day quarantine.
        Risk classifications are as follows:
            2.2.2.3.1. Low Risk: Incident (bite, scratch, mucous membrane exposure) involves
            healthy dog or cat (not a stray) where the owner is known and the dog or cat is
            available for 10-day quarantine. Squirrels, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chipmunks,
            rats, mice, opossums, armadillos, and other rodents, rabbits, and hares are generally
            considered minimal risk (Note: these animals can carry rabies, though it is
            infrequent) unless there are unusual circumstances.
            2.2.2.3.2. Moderate Risk: Incident (bite, scratch, mucous membrane exposure)
            involves dog or cat with bites or injuries to the face, head and neck, OR bites from
            dogs or cats too young for vaccination, OR bites from STRAY dogs or cats
            AVAILABLE for 10-day quarantine (Note: 10-day quarantine is only valid for dogs
            and cats).
            2.2.2.3.3. High Risk: Incident (bite, scratch, mucous membrane exposure) involves a
            STRAY dog or cat NOT available for quarantine, OR a wild animal likely to carry
            rabies such as a bat, raccoon, skunk, fox, coyote, etc. OR an animal exhibiting signs
            of rabies. In incidents involving bats, PEP may be appropriate even in the absence of
            demonstrable bite, scratch, or mucous membrane exposure such as when a sleeping
            individual awakes to find a bat in their room, or an intoxicated individual or small
            child, or someone who otherwise can’t give an accurate account, or if a bat flies up
            and brushes against an individual.
59THMDWI48-107 19 MAY 2011                                                                     5


       2.2.2.4. The provider may convene telephonically, the Rabies Advisory Board (Flight
       Surgeon, Base Veterinarian, PH) on Moderate or High Risk bites to discuss the need for
       PEP. Generally, the recommendation is to administer rabies post-exposure prophylaxis
       on all MODERATE (unless animal appears healthy and is available for 10-day
       quarantine) and HIGH RISK incidents as outlined in Table 2.1. If the provider deviates
       from this recommendation, he must clearly document WHY. The Human Diploid Cell
       Rabies Vaccine (HDCV) series can be stopped if the dog or cat is found to be healthy at
       the end of the 10-day quarantine or the animal’s rabies test is negative.

Table 2.1. Rabies Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) for Persons Not Previously Vaccinated.
 Treatment            Regimen
 RIG (Rabies          Administer 20 IU/kg body weight. If anatomically feasible, the full dose
 Immunoglobulin)      should be infiltrated in and around the wounds and any remaining volume
                      should be administered intramuscular (IM) in the gluteal muscle. Rabies
                      Immune Globulin should not be administered in the same syringe as vaccine.
                      Because RIG might partially suppress active production of antibody, no
                      more than the recommended dose should be given. Note: Persons who
                      have been previously vaccinated for rabies, such as veterinarians, do not
                      require RIG, therefore consult CDC guidance for HCDV vaccination
                      schedule
 Vaccine              HDCV, Rabies Vaccine Adsorbed, or Purified Chick Embryo Cell Culture
                      Rabies Vaccine 1.0 mL, IM (deltoid area for adults; anteriolateral thigh for
                      infants and small children), one each on days 0, 3, 7, 14. Day 0 is the day
                      the RIG and 1st dose of vaccine is given. Note: Vaccine should NEVER be
                      given in the gluteal muscle as this may result in lower neutralizing antibody
                      titers.

Table 2.2. Rabies Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) for Persons Previously Vaccinated.
 Treatment            Regimen
 RIG (Rabies          RIG should not be administered.
 Immunoglobulin)
 Vaccine               HDCV or Purified Chick Embryo Cell Culture Rabies Vaccine 1.0 mL, IM
                       (deltoid area for adults), 1 each on days 0 and 3.
 Note: For persons with immunosuppression, rabies PEP should be administered using all 5 doses of
 vaccine on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28.

       2.2.2.5. Provide patients the immunization schedule (Day 0 [the day the RIG and 1st
       vaccine dose is given], 3, 7, 14,) as outlined in current CDC guidelines, and
       instruct/direct patients to follow-up with appropriate clinics to complete HDCV series on
       weekdays and/or weekends/holidays.
       2.2.2.6. Assess the tetanus status of the patient and administers booster doses as
       indicated.
       2.2.2.7. Assess the risk for Dysgonic Fermentator-2 infection and administers antibiotics
       as indicated.

       bite that are loose on base and document contact on the DD Form 2341, block 20.b. (This
       can be accomplished by any admin support from the treating providers clinic.)
       2.2.2.10. Document immunizations administered in the Air Force Complete
       Immunization Tracking Application (AFCITA). This can be accomplished by any admin
       support function from the treating providers clinic.

latent tuberculosis in active duty Air Force personnel, military beneficiaries, basic trainees,
civilians at Defense Language Institute (DLI), medical employees, and child care employees.
4.2. General. Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by germs that are spread from person to
person through the air. TB germs are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs
or throat coughs, sneezes, speaks, or sings. These germs can stay in the air for several hours,
depending on the environment. Persons who breathe in the air containing these TB germs can
become exposed or infected; this is called latent TB infection. Exposure or TB infection is
determined by the administration of a tuberculin skin test (TST).
   4.2.1. Persons with latent TB have a 10% risk of developing active TB in their lifetime; 5%
   of the risk is during the first 2 years immediately following TST conversion, and the other
   5% risk is during the rest of their lifetime. Identification and treatment of latent TB greatly
   reduces the likelihood of active TB, thereby preventing further infections. TST is conducted
   as follows:
       4.2.1.1. Active duty Air Force personnel and military dependents are tested for TB based
       on exposure risk and clinical symptoms using a TST. Active duty personnel are required
       to have as a minimum a documented TST.
       4.2.1.2. Medical personnel are tested IAW the Medical Employee Health Program.
       4.2.1.3. Personnel working in base child care facilities are tested initially IAW the
       Department of Defense’s (DoD) accrediting body for DoD Child Development Centers,
       the National Association for the Education of Young Children and whenever clinically
       indicated. (Note: Annual TST is not required for child care centers in Bexar County.)
       Personnel at DLI will receive testing annually and be tracked in the Air Force Complete
       Immunization Tracking Application.
       4.2.1.4. Basic trainees are screened for tuberculosis upon arrival to Lackland Air Force
       Base.
4.3. Responsibilities.
   4.3.1. The 59 MDW Immunization Clinic will:
       4.3.1.1. Administer and read all TSTs. Routine surveillance testing is accomplished on
       personnel in accordance with AFI 48-105, Surveillance, Prevention and Control of
       Diseases and Conditions of Public Health or Military Significance.
       4.3.1.2. Schedule follow-up appointments and brief patients on the importance of
       returning to have the TST read and result documented. Note: TSTs can only be
       documented as ―negative‖ 48-72 hrs after test is administered. Negative tests not read
       within this time frame must be repeated on the opposite arm.
       4.3.1.3. Enter all active duty, basic trainees and family members’ TST results into the
       AFCITA and print a DD Form 2766C, Adult Preventive and Chronic Care Flowsheet
10                                                         59THMDWI48-107 19 MAY 2011


     (Continuation Sheet), for the patient’s hard copy medical record and for the patient’s
     personal records. Note: Basic Military Trainees have a separate stand alone AFCITA
     used to track their immunizations.
     4.3.1.4. Document the results of TSTs in the patient’s shot record. Document tests
     assessed by a provider as ―positive‖ to prevent repeat testing of individuals with Latent
     Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI).
     4.3.1.5. Refers all persons with a reaction of greater than or equal to 5mm indurations to
     PH (with their shot records/medical record) for interview and counseling.
  4.3.2. The 559th AMDS Public Health will:
     4.3.2.1. Initiate AF Form 2453, Tuberculosis Detection and Control Data, for all patients
     referred with a 5mm or greater TST.
     4.3.2.2. Conduct initial patient interview and education of patients with reactions of 5
     mm or greater induration and refer patients to the healthcare provider for latent TB
     ―positive‖ determination. Patients classified as ―positive‖ by the provider will be
     assessed for LTBI treatment.
     4.3.2.3. Ensure provider orders baseline chest x-ray test for patients with a positive TST
     result and document in the medical record. Note: If the patient is pregnant or suspects
     pregnancy, they do not receive an x-ray. It is the provider’s clinical decision, but
     generally prior to initiating treatment for latent TB, baseline liver function (LFT’s) tests
     are also ordered.
     4.3.2.4. Re-enforce education regarding LTBI, signs and symptoms of active
     tuberculosis, treatment to include importance of strict adherence to treatment protocol,
     and potential side effects of isoniazid (INH) medication. Discuss the importance of
     notifying their provider of potential problems related to the INH (or other approved CDC
     treatment regimen) medication adherence, signs and symptoms of active TB, and
     potential medication side effects. Patients will be instructed to contact their provider
     prior to running out of their medication. Already addressed in section 4.3.3.5.
     4.3.2.5. Enter patients into Preventive Health Assessment and Individual Medical
     Readiness so the provider can track monthly INH follow-up.
     4.3.2.6. Notify the appropriate (military or civilian) public health authorities when
     patients requiring follow-up: permanent change of station (PCS), retire, or separate from
     military.
     4.3.2.7. Conduct epidemiological investigations for active cases of TB in workplaces and
     TST conversion clusters.
     4.3.2.8. Report active TB cases to Air Force and San Antonio Metropolitan Health
     District.
  4.3.3. The 559 AMDS healthcare provider will:
     4.3.3.1. Order baseline chest x-ray and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), HIV (unless
     documented HIV risk assessment indicates low risk) and aspartate aminotransferase
     (AST) as indicated. Baseline ALT and AST are indicated for persons infected with HIV,
     pregnant women, women in the immediate postpartum period (usually within 3 months of
59THMDWI48-107 19 MAY 2011                                                                       11


      delivery), persons with a history of liver disease, persons who use alcohol regularly, and
      those who have or are at risk for chronic liver disease.
      4.3.3.2. Evaluate patients with a 5 mm or greater TST to determine if the skin test is
      ―positive‖ based on their risk for infection and in accordance with Air Force and CDC
      guidelines. Determine the patient’s disease status (latent or active TB), initiate and
      document appropriate treatment IAW CDC guidelines.
      4.3.3.3. Clearly document the rationale if patient is not started on medication (examples:
      liver disease, previous reaction to INH therapy, or suspended due to short-notice PCS,
      pregnancy, etc.). Note: PCS is not a valid reason to delay treatment unless there is
      insufficient time to evaluate the patient’s tolerance of the medication.
      4.3.3.4. Document positive TST results and dates in the medical record, and the
      medication administered.
      4.3.3.5. Monitor personnel on the TB Detection and Control Program monthly and
      schedule follow-up appointments and laboratory testing as necessary. Maintain a
      confidential log listing or other tracking system of pertinent patient information, dates for
      follow-up testing and results of laboratory tests. Ensure personnel on flying status are
      grounded for the first 7 days of treatment.
      4.3.3.6. Conduct and document in the patient’s medical record monthly follow-ups to
      ensure appropriate documentation includes:
          4.3.3.6.1. Patient’s adherence to treatment protocol.
          4.3.3.6.2. Potential signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis.
          4.3.3.6.3. Potential medication side effects. Research suggests evaluation for
          medical side effects is a better indicator of potential hepatoxicity than reliance on
          liver function tests. In general, studies have shown that persons 35 years of age or
          older tend to develop hepatotoxicity at a greater frequency. Therefore, 59 MDW
          policy is to initially conduct monthly AST/ALT for persons 35 years of age or older
          to establish a trend in the patient’s LFTs and then either continue or stop testing at the
          clinician’s discretion. Educate patients to stop taking medication if they experience
          medication side effects and to immediately contact their provider to determine if
          treatment should continue.
      4.3.3.7. Order INH medication refills. Ensure patients obtain medications from the
      Pharmacy.
      4.3.3.8. Close out the AF Form 2453 when the patient completes or discontinues INH or
      other prophylaxis and notify PH. Send medical record and all documentation to PH for
      close out.
   4.3.4. The 59 MDW Pharmacy will:
      4.3.4.1. Issue patients their INH or accepted alternative medication in accordance with
      the primary care manager’s directions.
4.4. Treatment Considerations.
   4.4.1. Treatment Choice:
12                                                        59THMDWI48-107 19 MAY 2011


     4.4.1.1. INH continues to be the drug of choice for LTBI.
     4.4.1.2. Other medications are recommended by the CDC for LTBI treatment, and
     should be considered if the patient was potentially exposed to multi-drug resistant TB or
     as clinically indicated by the provider. Additionally, approved research protocols may be
     used as alternative treatment regimens, when of benefit to the Air Force.
     4.4.1.3. Medical contraindications to INH treatment include previous adverse reactions
     to INH treatment, acute hepatitis, and end-stage liver disease. Treatment is not
     contraindicated in patients who are HIV positive, pregnant, women immediately
     postpartum (within 3 months of delivery), history of chronic liver disease/infection
     (hepatitis B/C, alcoholic hepatitis, or cirrhosis), persons who use alcohol regularly, and
     persons at risk for chronic liver disease. However, these patients should receive baseline
     liver function testing and be monitored closely for INH side effects (monthly evaluations
     and routine laboratory monitoring–liver function testing).
  4.4.2. Treatment Length for Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI):
     4.4.2.1. The current CDC Core Curriculum on Tuberculosis states the optimal course of
     treatment for LTBI is 9 months of INH.
     4.4.2.2. Slight delays in completing treatment are acceptable, but not recommended.
     CDC doesn’t recommend reinitiating treatment if the patient completes the 9-month
     course of INH (270 doses) therapy in 12 months. If the patient has a 2 month lapse in
     therapy their 9-month course will be re-started.
     4.4.2.3. Provider must clearly document in the patient’s medical record any variation in
     the recommended 9-month course of treatment to include reasons for the variation.

Terms
Active Tuberculosis (TB)—Persons exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) as evidenced
by a positive tuberculin skin test and are symptomatic and clinically ill. The possibility of
Pulmonary TB should be considered in persons who have a productive cough, prolonged cough
(duration of 3 weeks) chest pain, hemoptysis, and the systemic symptoms of TB including fever,
chills, night sweats, appetite loss, weight loss, and easy fatigability. See the definition for latent
tuberculosis below.
59THMDWI48-107 19 MAY 2011                                                                  17


Latent Tuberculosis—Persons exposed to Mycobacterium TB as evidenced by a positive
tuberculin skin test, but who are not sick or have symptoms of active TB disease are considered
to have latent TB. Persons with latent TB infection are not infectious and cannot spread TB
infection to others.
