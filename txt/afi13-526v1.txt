This instruction replaces AFI 11-299, Nuclear Airlift Operations, and implements AFPD 13-5,
Air Force Nuclear Enterprise, and is consistent with AFPD 11-2, Aircrew Operations, and
portions of AFJI 11-204, Operational Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials,
and T.O. 11N-45-51 series, Transportation of Nuclear Weapons Materiel. It establishes the
requirements and guidance for wartime and peacetime logistic airlift of DoD nuclear and
nuclear-related cargo. This AFI may be supplemented at any level, but all supplements that
directly implement this publication must be routed to AMC/A3N for coordination prior to
certification and approval. It applies to all personnel, especially planners, aircrews, controllers,
security forces and maintenance personnel, involved in nuclear airlift and wartime/peacetime
nuclear logistics movements. Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) does not apply to the ANG
and AFRC. PNAF shoring kit requirements are detailed in AMCI 24-101, Vol 11, Cargo and
Mail Policy.

1.1. Objective. Guidance contained in Volume 2, 3, and 4 of this instruction series is written
exclusive of each other based upon the mission to be executed. Specifically, guidance from one
of these Volumes does not apply to any of the other Volumes. This Volume prescribes the
organization and basic guidance for planning, scheduling, controlling, executing, and supporting
nuclear cargo airlift Special Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM). It includes standard
procedures to be used by Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) aircrews, maintenance personnel,
and all other entities supporting a PNAF mission.
1.2. Key Words Explained
     1.2.1. “Will” and “shall” indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.2.2. "Should" is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.2.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.2.4. "Note" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered essential
     to emphasize.
1.3. Responsibilities. AMC, Nuclear Operations Division (AMC/A3N), is the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) for this instruction. Unless otherwise specified in cited source
references, AMC/A3 is the waiver authority for the procedures unique to this publication and 18
AF/CC is the authority for specified mission planning and execution waivers.
1.4. Distribution. The following individuals and agencies associated with supporting or
executing nuclear airlift operations will maintain a copy of this instruction:
     1.4.1. Commanders of nuclear capable logistics units (PNAF/ Munitions Squadron (MUNS)/
     Munitions Support Squadron (MUNSS)).
     1.4.2. Operations, logistics, and safety staff agencies.
     1.4.3. Security Forces units.
     1.4.4. PNAF airlift squadron(s)/units.
     1.4.5. Each individual PNAF aircrew member.
     1.4.6. Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO) for nuclear accounts.
     1.4.7. Custodial unit Civil Engineering, Readiness and Emergency Management, and
     Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) units.
     1.4.8. Air Force Inspection Agency (AFIA) and applicable nuclear MAJCOM IGs.
1.5. Protecting Classified Information.
     1.5.1. Use caution at all times to avoid compromising classified information. Adhere to all
     available classification guidance.
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                        7


   1.5.2. AFI 16-610, Special Weapons Overflight Guide (SWOG), the Air Force Nuclear
   Weapons Security Classification Policy, CG-W-5, Joint DOE/DoD Nuclear Weapon
   Classification Policy Guide, TCG-WPMU-2, Joint DOE/DoD Topical Classification Guide
   for Weapon Production and Military Use, Airlift Request, Mission Setup Message, and
   nuclear transportation technical orders govern the classification of nuclear mission
   information. Restricted data and formerly restricted data are not normally releasable to
   foreign nationals (NOFORN). Do not send this type of information to any agency (civilian
   or military) of a foreign government unless directed to do so by an authoritative publication
   such as the SWOG.
   1.5.3. Do not use terms in unclassified text that reveals nuclear or classified cargo is aboard
   a specific aircraft or mission or at a specific location.
   1.5.4. Do not talk around classified information. Use only the SAAM number, aircraft tail
   number, or Aircraft Commander’s name when discussing a particular mission in unclassified
   media or via open lines. Do not use the term “PNAF” or “special weapons mission” in
   conjunction with the SAAM number, aircraft tail number, or Aircraft Commander’s name.
   Do not associate line numbers with any of the shipping information that reveals actual
   nuclear cargo data (e.g., nuclear cargo or package name, net explosive weight (NEW),
   dimensions, or weight).

                                          Chapter 2

                                MISSION MANAGEMENT

2.1. General. This Chapter provides guidance in planning and scheduling nuclear airlift
missions. OPSEC is essential at all times and in all mission correspondence. Nuclear airlift
mission success relies upon reliable, qualified, and prepared aircrews and support personnel
during all phases of a mission (from planning through execution). As a critical function of
reliability, crew morale is essential to enduring nuclear airlift mission success.
2.2. Planning and Scheduling Criteria. Nuclear surety, national security, and mission
compliance with Weapon System Safety Rules (WSSR) are the most important considerations
when scheduling a mission.
   2.2.1. Deliver nuclear cargo by the most efficient route to minimize the number of landings
   and handling of nuclear cargo.
       2.2.1.1. AFI 16-610, Special Weapons Overflight Guide (SWOG) applies.
       2.2.1.2. Missions transporting nuclear cargo must be planned and executed to avoid
       heavily populated areas to the maximum extent possible. This consideration must not
       cause such an additive amount of time to generate additional air refueling or crew
       requirements.
   2.2.2. Mission planners, squadron/unit Nuclear Airlift Monitor (NAM), aircrew, shipper, and
   receiver personnel will coordinate on all scheduled operations and sequences of events.
   2.2.3. Plan missions to ensure onloading and offloading of nuclear cargo, ground crew
   operations, and convoy movement times occur during daylight hours. Exceptions to this
   policy must be approved by the US installation wing commander, or for MUNSS locations,
   MUNSS commander and host nation installation commander.
   2.2.4. To avoid overloading host base security and support agencies, do not normally
   schedule more than one nuclear-laden aircraft to transit the same airfield each day. More
   than one mission a day may only be scheduled if approved by the US installation wing
   commander, or for MUNSS locations, MUNSS commander and host nation installation
   commander.
   2.2.5. Mission planners will ensure all primary and supporting installation agencies are
   coordinated with when determining Crew Replacing, Staging, and Swapping sequence of
   events (SOE) and procedures for a particular mission. See paragraph 2.12 for additional
   execution guidance.
   2.2.6. Aircrew scheduling requirements/limits in AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 3, C-17 Operations
   Procedures, and this Volume of this instruction apply. Due to the critical importance of
   safely transporting nuclear cargo, the portion of any mission from the beginning of Crew
   Duty Day (CDD) until the aircrew is no longer required per DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-
   108, is further restricted as follows:
       2.2.6.1. When nuclear cargo is airlifted, all PNAF duties will be accomplished within the
       PNAF CDD. When PNAF duties are complete or the PNAF CDD has expired, aircrew
12                                                             AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


     may only perform non-nuclear ground/flight duties within the remaining Crew Duty
     Time (CDT) IAW AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 3.
        2.2.6.1.1. Basic PNAF CDD.          Limited to 16+00 hours (regardless of crew
        composition).
        2.2.6.1.2. Augmented PNAF CDD. Limited to 20+00 hours for missions scheduled
        for aerial refueling (A/R) or a C17 mission using the extended range tank in lieu of an
        A/R. If a scheduled A/R is canceled after crew alert and the crew was alerted for a
        20-hour crew duty day, PNAF CDD will not exceed 20+00 hours.
     2.2.6.2. Basic and Augmented PNAF CDDs include ground time for loading and
     offloading of nuclear cargo and terminates when the aircrew is no longer required per
     DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108. Additionally, the operating crew must develop a
     work-rest plan to mitigate Operational Risk Management (ORM) factors.
     2.2.6.3. The 18 AF/CC is the waiver authority for PNAF scheduling requirements and
     CDD limits associated with this instruction. Waivers may be requested by either the
     operating wing or the 618 AOC (TACC).
     2.2.6.4. Ensure adequate ground time is available for proper crew rest prior to executing
     a nuclear airlift mission segment.
        2.2.6.4.1. Before home station departure or crew replacement, stage, or swap, crew
        duty periods will not exceed 16+00 hours unless crews are afforded a minimum of
        24+00 hours ground time prior to alerting for a nuclear airlift mission.
        2.2.6.4.2. During non-nuclear PNAF mission segments (no nuclear or nuclear-related
        cargo transported, onloaded, or offloaded), CDT will be IAW AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 3.
        These segments will not be planned to exceed a basic 16+00 hour CDD unless ground
        time at the nuclear loading location is at least 24+00 hours prior to executing a
        nuclear PNAF mission segment.
     2.2.6.5. Ground Operations. Required ground operations vary greatly depending upon
     the cargo type, quantity, and overall complexity of the operation. Therefore, planners
     will develop the mission itinerary with detailed input from the operating squadron/unit
     prior to publishing the Mission Setup Message.
        2.2.6.5.1. Remain Over Night (RON).            Aircrew fatigue and morale have
        immeasurable impacts on nuclear surety. Crew rest locations should be selected not
        only for mission requirements, but also to provide a suitable atmosphere for crew rest.
        2.2.6.5.2. To ensure crew and installation support personnel are focused solely upon
        the offload operation, PNAF missions will normally be scheduled to crew rest at the
        conclusion of a nuclear airlift segment. Note: If custodial installation aircraft
        support is inadequate for RON conditions between offload and onload operations, a
        repositioning leg is authorized to a suitable installation.
            2.2.6.5.2.1. Normal ground time between arrival and departure is 17+15 hours. If
            both an offload upon arrival and onload prior to departure are scheduled, ground
            time should be a minimum of 20+15 hours. Planners may adjust ground time to
            satisfy known mission requirements, but ground time will never be less than
            16+30 hours.
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                        13


             2.2.6.5.2.2. PNAF missions carrying nuclear cargo will not be scheduled to RON
             at an en route location. With the exception of emergency divert situations,
             nuclear cargo laden aircraft will only RON at installations with adequate support.
             2.2.6.5.2.3. USAFE/A3/10 approval is required to RON with nuclear cargo
             aboard (Hot RON) in the USAFE Area of Responsibility (AOR).
             2.2.6.5.2.4. Refer to the SWOG for additional RON guidance.
         2.2.6.5.3. En route Stop (Non-RON). Normal ground time for loading and
         offloading is 3+15 hours. Planners must adjust this time based on the type and
         quantity of cargo being transported, ground support available, and anticipated
         complexity of on/offload procedures. Do not pad ground or flight times to avoid
         delays or cut times to remain within PNAF CDD constraints.
     2.2.6.6. Pre/Depositioning Mission Segments.
         2.2.6.6.1. PNAF missions will not be planned to flow from or into another equal or
         higher priority mission without approval of the 18 AF/CC.
         2.2.6.6.2. Due to stringent maintenance preparation for mission aircraft, schedule
         only the minimum number of legs required to position the aircraft at it’s onload
         location. If a stop is planned, it must be at an en route station able to provide suitable
         support if necessary.
         2.2.6.6.3. PNAF missions will be scheduled to crew rest at the conclusion of a
         nuclear airlift mission prior to returning to home station or other follow on non-
         nuclear mission tasking. The PNAF Aircraft Commander may request a quick turn or
         an early return to home station through normal channels.
         2.2.6.6.4. On depositioning legs without nuclear or nuclear-related cargo, the
         operating airlift wing may return the aircraft and crew to home station on training
         time. If the operating wing elects to operate on training time, aircrews will coordinate
         their intentions with 618 AOC (TACC)/XOC prior to their depositioning leg. 618
         AOC (TACC)/XOOOD planners will not recut the mission, but must be notified, and
         a change to the Mission Setup Message will not be made. When requested by the
         operating mission wing, training time should be planned into Mission Setup Message
         prior to mission launch from home station to minimize coordination efforts during the
         nuclear airlift-tasked portion of the mission.
  2.2.7. Schedulers, planners, and operating crews must also consider the following:
     2.2.7.1. DoD Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), at https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil or
     http://www.fcg.pentagon.smil.mil, which also includes a Classified Supplement.
     2.2.7.2. Host military command restrictions.
     2.2.7.3. Airfield restrictions, operating hours, Prior Permission Required (PPR), etc.
     2.2.7.4. User capability (hours of operation, security, etc.).
     2.2.7.5. DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108.
     2.2.7.6. Deconflict mission itinerary with non-support messages IAW AFI 21-203,
     Nuclear Accountability Procedures.
 14                                                                   AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


         2.2.7.7. Planning considerations found in DoDI 4540.05, DoD Transportation of US
         Nuclear Weapons.
2.3. Air Refueling (A/R).
      2.3.1. A/R should be planned to reduce ground exposure of nuclear cargo at bases without
      established authorized weapons storage areas (WSA) and to avoid the increased safety and
      security risks inherent in additional approaches, landings, takeoffs, and departures. Plan
      these missions to be accomplished non-stop between onload and offload installations. PNAF
      missions will only A/R when necessary to make destinations and suitable alternates with
      required contingency fuel.
      2.3.2. Mission planners will coordinate with 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOKS for tanker support.
      618 AOC (TACC)/XOPSA will coordinate altitude reservations with the appropriate altitude
      reservation facility. Plan a backup 24­hour slip in tanker support and altitude reservations, if
      applicable.
         2.3.2.1. Include the following information in the tanker request and A/R supplement:
             2.3.2.1.1. Airborne or manned ground spares for each primary tanker.
                 2.3.2.1.1.1. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD mission planners will determine the best
                 option to meet the requirements of that particular mission segment. The mission
                 planners will coordinate the information with 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOKS for
                 planning. If an airborne spare is used, the spare might not be required to offload
                 fuel.
                 2.3.2.1.1.2. A/R planners should coordinate spare tankers at a separate location
                 outside the primary's weather pattern. 618 AOC (TACC)/DDO3 will ensure
                 notifications, restrictions, and requirements are passed to the operating tanker
                 wing(s).
                 2.3.2.1.1.3. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD mission planners will provide the
                 operating tanker crew a briefing concerning mission OPSEC, SWOG routing, and
                 other relevant restrictions via secure means.
                 2.3.2.1.1.4. To minimize en route times and CDD, use single primary and
                 alternate tankers for each planned A/R to the maximum extent possible. Mission
                 planners and tanker units will only split the planned offload of fuel across
                 multiple tankers if a single tanker is incapable of providing all the total required
                 fuel.
                 2.3.2.1.1.5. A single KC­10 tanker may backup two KC-135 tankers if the
                 offload is sufficient and does not exceed A/R performance charts. A different
                 refueling altitude and routing along the altitude reservation (ALTRV) or A/R
                 track may need to be coordinated and approved before substituting a KC-135 with
                 a KC-10.
             2.3.2.1.2. SWOG restrictions apply to the tanker(s) when refueling.
   2.3.3. To prepare for the unlikely event of an unsuccessful A/R, PNAF support bases and
   pre-coordinated emergency divert locations identified in the Mission Setup Message will
   stand by to support emergency diverts until released by 618 AOC (TACC)/XOC.
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                      15


      2.3.3.1. Ensure the pre-coordinated emergency divert location is prepared to receive a
      nuclear-laden aircraft in the event of an emergency divert. Wing commanders at these
      designated bases will ensure the capability to provide security for potential emergency
      diverts of nuclear-laden aircraft IAW the Mission Setup Message and DoD S-5210.41-
      M_AFMAN 31-108. Should the A/R be aborted, 618 AOC (TACC) will notify the pre-
      coordinated emergency divert location and confirm host nation notification/coordination.
      2.3.3.2. Do not attempt to contact the crew in flight to determine successful completion
      of the A/R unless no message has been received from the crew after 15 minutes past the
      anticipated completion of the air refueling. Contact the crew if a high priority message or
      emergency order must immediately be transmitted. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD planners
      or XOCG will notify the appropriate pre-coordinated emergency divert location and
      release ground support personnel after the A/R is successfully completed.
   2.3.4. If the Aircraft Commander determines at any time that the planned A/R is not
   necessary, they must cancel A/R at the earliest opportunity. The Aircraft Commander’s
   decision is final.
   2.3.5. A/R over open ocean areas at least 12 nautical miles (NM) off shore.
      2.3.5.1. The A/R must be accomplished as safely, efficiently, and expediently as
      possible.
          2.3.5.1.1. Accomplish only those maneuvers required for transferring the mission
          required fuel. Example: Receiving the required onload from the primary tanker only.
          Additional events during A/R beyond those necessary to onload required fuel,
          including training by tanker and/or receiver crews, are prohibited at all times.
          2.3.5.1.2. Do not conduct A/R upgrade training on missions carrying nuclear cargo.
          2.3.5.1.3. If the PNAF Aircraft Commander is a current Instructor or Evaluator in the
          aircraft, they may refuel from either seat, regardless of who is occupying the other
          seat.
      2.3.5.2. Current and qualified PNAF Aircraft Commander certified pilots may perform
      air refueling on nuclear cargo-laden missions, provided the designated PNAF mission
      Aircraft Commander is occupying the other seat.
   2.3.6. The Aircraft Commander will provide the post-A/R report to the controlling C2 cell
   via appropriate means within 15 minutes after completing an A/R.
   2.3.7. To minimize crew fatigue and negative nuclear surety implications, aircrews will only
   accomplish one offload of nuclear cargo after an A/R segment.
2.4. Mission Planning/Coordination.
   2.4.1. Cargo Clearances. The AFNWC/NCL will transmit cargo clearance requests as
   required by the SWOG. A copy of the request will be forwarded to the 618 AOC
   (TACC)/XOOOD planners.
   2.4.2. Overflight Clearances. Mission planners will coordinate overflight clearances as
   required by the SWOG and country specific Letters of Understanding.

      2.4.3. Diplomatic Clearances. Mission planners will coordinate Diplomatic Clearances as
      required by the SWOG and the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide.
      2.4.4. Plan nuclear airlift mission itineraries with the utmost care. Consider factors such as
      weather, routing, overflight rights, suitable alternate/emergency airfields, host base
      capabilities, anticipated onload/offload times, fuel requirements, CDT, PNAF CDD, and
      aircrew fatigue factors. Refer to the SWOG for additional information.
      2.4.5. An initial “soft” itinerary will be transmitted to applicable units approximately 30
      days prior to mission execution. Units will acknowledge and provide required responses
      within 3 duty days of receipt.
2.5. Mission Setup Message (Content, Classification, and Distribution).
      2.5.1. Mission planners will prepare a classified Mission Setup Message for all missions
      transporting nuclear cargo. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD planners will send Setup Message at
      least 15-calendar days before home station departure. (See Attachment 3 for a sample
      message). Support requirements will be coordinated by secure means at all times.
      2.5.2. The classified Mission Setup Message is the sole source of mission information to
      users and host bases.
      2.5.3. Mission Setup Messages will be classified according to mission destinations,
      overflight classification designated by the SWOG, or the Air Force Nuclear Weapons
      Security Classification Policy.
         2.5.3.1. PART I will be unclassified.
         2.5.3.2. PART II will be classified. All paragraph classifications will be marked in

         2.5.5.2.2. Organizations or individuals approved for receipt of the Mission Setup
         Message will annually validate approval by the end of each fiscal year (FYXX) with
         the applicable MAJCOM.
  2.5.6. Mission Setup Message (Station Support Requirements Acknowledgement and 24-
  Hour Confirmation):
     2.5.6.1. All stations listed on the mission itinerary will send an acknowledgement of
     ability to support/non-support the mission itinerary and/or the applicable special
     requirements listed in Part II of the Mission Setup Message.
         2.5.6.1.1. The Acknowledgement of Station Support Requirements message will use
         a standard format. (AF Form 527D)
         2.5.6.1.2. Paragraph 7 of the Mission Setup Message will state when
         acknowledgement needs to be received by the mission planners, operational unit, and
         the 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2. Mission planners will provide three working
         days for stations to send an acknowledgement to an original Mission Setup Message.
         2.5.6.1.3. A station only needs to send acknowledgement for the most current
         Mission Setup Message, i.e., when a change to a Mission Setup Message is released
         before a station has sent the acknowledgement for the previous message.
     2.5.6.2. A 24-Hour Confirmation of Support Requirements message will be sent by all en
     route stations and pre-coordinated emergency divert locations as listed in the mission
     itinerary. A station with multiple itinerary entries on the same day can be combined on
     one 24-Hour message. A station with a single entry spanning two consecutive days and
     no additional entries on the second day need only send one 24-Hour message.
         2.5.6.2.1. The 24-Hour Confirmation of Support Requirements message will use a
         standard format. (AF Form 527E)
         2.5.6.2.2. The 24-Hour Confirmation of Support Requirements message will be sent
         to the mission planners, operational unit, and 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2 no
         later than 24-Hours prior to station arrival. If 24-Hours prior falls on a non-duty days
         then the message will be sent the first duty day prior. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG-
         DDO2 will make a final voice confirmation of support from the 24-Hour POC listed
         on the acknowledgement and confirmation messages.
         2.5.6.2.3. A station only needs to send a 24-Hour Confirmation of Support message
         for the most current Mission Setup Message, i.e., when a change to a Mission Setup
 18                                                                 AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


             Message is released before a station has sent the 24-Hour Confirmation for the
             previous message.
2.6. Changes to Mission Setup Message.
      2.6.1. Changes to Mission Setup Messages must be kept to a minimum. Should changes be
      absolutely necessary the following guidance will apply:
         2.6.1.1. All changes will be coordinated and distributed IAW paragraph 2.5.5. and
         acknowledged IAW para 2.5.6.
         2.6.1.2. Separate messages will be used for each change. Change messages will be in the
         original format with a clear statement advising the reason for change and all changes will
         clearly identify the information that is changed.
         2.6.1.3. Changes will not be generated solely to correct non-critical typographical errors.
         Write-in changes to Mission Setup Messages are not permitted.
      2.6.2. Requesting Changes to the Mission Setup Message.
         2.6.2.1. Requests to change a mission setup must come from the requesting unit’s
         Wg/CC and be submitted to 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD for coordination.
         2.6.2.2. Stations that submit a non-support acknowledgement message will also send a
         request for change to the Setup Message.
         2.6.2.3. Requests to change the mission itinerary by greater than 2 hours will not be
         accepted within 10 days of mission execution.
         2.6.2.4. Missions enter execution 24-Hours prior to scheduled home station departure
         and are complete after the last active leg of the mission itinerary. Changes to the mission
         setup will be issued automatically for the following:
             2.6.2.4.1. Mission is delayed more than 2 hours by maintenance, weather, or other
             factors.
             2.6.2.4.2. Change to cargo information that does not impact the itinerary or timing
             beyond 2 hours.
             2.6.2.4.3. Aircraft Divert
             2.6.2.4.4. A change will not be issued solely to cancel an A/R.
   2.6.3. Waiver authority is 618 AOC (TACC)/CC. Note: Waiver requests that do not contain
   the following information below will be denied:
         2.6.3.1. Name, grade, unit and title of requester.
         2.6.3.2. Date of request.
         2.6.3.3. Mission number of affected mission.
         2.6.3.4. Detailed reason the change is necessary.
         2.6.3.5. Date and time the required change was discovered.
   2.6.4. When changes to the itinerary are necessary after a mission has started, 618 AOC
   (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2 will coordinate with 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD nuclear airlift
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                       19


   mission planners to publish changes to the Mission Setup Message and forward to the
   aircrew with an information copy to the operating wing. To avoid delay of a mission, voice
   confirmation of changes between 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2 and the aircrew are
   acceptable but should be used as a last resort only. Change to the Mission Setup Message
   will be forwarded to all stations and the operating wing using the format in Attachment 3.
2.7. Additional Airlift Requirements.
   2.7.1. If changes to nuclear/nuclear-related cargo are approved before the mission starts, the
   Mission Setup Message will be changed through normal channels via procedures listed in
   paragraph 2.6.
   2.7.2. Attachment 3 lists the types of nuclear and nuclear-related materials and associated
   handling requirements. The AFNWC/NCL will schedule nuclear and nuclear-related cargo
   missions via the Nuclear Ordnance Shipping Schedule (NOSS). Any changes to the
   AFNWC/NCL SAAM Airlift Request must be coordinated between 618 AOC
   (TACC)/XOOOD and the AFNWC/NCL. Coordination must be accomplished as soon as
   additional cargo is identified.
   2.7.3. Only nuclear cargo identified in the Mission Setup Message and Airlift Request may
   be accepted.
      2.7.3.1. If a discrepancy is identified between the nuclear cargo, the Mission Setup
      Message, or the Airlift Request, contact 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD planners through the
      Consolidated Control Center (CCC). 618 AOC (TACC) will immediately contact
      AFNWC/NCL to resolve any discrepancies. AFNWC/NCL will identify to 618 AOC
      (TACC) acceptable actions, e.g.           serial number of nuclear cargo transposed.
      AFNWC/NCL will recommend if the nuclear cargo should be accepted by AMC Courier
      or should remain at the shipping unit and transported on a future mission. The Courier
      retains the ultimate authority to accept or deny nuclear cargo.
      2.7.3.2. If AFNWC/NCL, 618 AOC (TACC), and the aircrew resolve the discrepancy
      and the decision is made to move the nuclear cargo, AFNWC/NCL will issue a new
      Airlift Request and 618 AOC (TACC) will issue a new SAAM Setup Message. The
      aircrew will not depart without a hard copy of the modified Airlift Request and Setup
      Message.
      2.7.3.3. If a discrepancy is identified at the arrival/offload location, it will be resolved
      prior to offloading nuclear cargo.
   2.7.4. Cargo:
      2.7.4.1. Opportune cargo may be carried on unsanitized positioning legs, but do not
      change the route of flight to solely accommodate the movement of cargo.
      2.7.4.2. Nuclear cargo will only be scheduled and airlifted if a loading procedure is
      published in T.O. 1C-17A-16-1, Loading and Air Transport of Nuclear Weapon Cargo.
      Accident/incident response or ENAO may dictate non-standard procedures to be used;
      however, appropriate T.O. procedures will be used to the maximum extent possible.
      AMC is not authorized to waive this requirement for PNAF operations.
      2.7.4.3. Unused space aboard nuclear cargo missions may be used for general cargo if:
 20                                                                AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


          2.7.4.3.1. The user approves the cargo to be aboard.
          2.7.4.3.2. Extra landings will not be required.
          2.7.4.3.3. The added weight will not adversely effect fuel requirements, aircraft
          center of gravity (CG), etc.
          2.7.4.3.4. It is compatible with the nuclear or nuclear-related cargo. Use the
          hazardous material compatibility chart in AFMAN 24-204(I), Preparing Hazardous
          Materials for Military Air Shipments, for air transportation to determine compatibility
          of nuclear cargo, major assemblies, and nuclear components with other explosive and
          hazardous materials.
          2.7.4.3.5. It will not cause additional handling and movement of nuclear cargo.
          Nuclear-related and general cargo (if jettisonable) must be loaded so it may be
          jettisoned, if necessary, without disturbing the nuclear cargo. Note: Time permitting
          aircrews should jettison general cargo before jettisoning nuclear-related cargo, and
          unclassified nuclear-related cargo before classified nuclear-related cargo.
          2.7.4.3.6. It will not cause security problems, including aerial port onloading and
          offloading.
          2.7.4.3.7. Cargo is thoroughly searched and sanitized before loading aboard the
          aircraft.
          2.7.4.3.8. After search and sanitization, it is stored in a secure manner.
      2.7.4.4. Foreign nationals (non-US persons/citizens) will not be used to load or offload
      nuclear or nuclear-related cargo. Additionally, foreign nationals will not be used to load
      or offload general cargo when nuclear and nuclear-related cargo is already aboard the
      aircraft.
2.8. Passengers, Mission Essential Personnel, and Flying Crew Chief.
   2.8.1. Passengers:
      2.8.1.1. After the aircraft is sanitized, passengers will not be carried until all nuclear
      cargo legs have been accomplished. After the last nuclear cargo sortie, passengers may
      be carried on any mission segment in which the aircraft is empty or only carrying general
      or unclassified nuclear-related cargo.
      2.8.1.2. When nuclear and/or classified nuclear-related cargo is aboard, only the
      following passengers may be carried as necessary to accomplish the PNAF mission:
          2.8.1.2.1. Couriers, shipper escorts, permissive action link (PAL) teams, authorized
          inspectors, flying crew chiefs, and security forces personnel authorized in the Airlift
          Request or by separate message. All personnel lists must be provided to the operating
          wing a minimum of ten days prior to home station departure.
   2.8.2. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP):
      2.8.2.1. MEPs must meet the basic requirements of applicable AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 3,
      AMCI 11208, Tanker/Airlift Operations, and AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
      Commanders at all levels must rigidly minimize the number of extra people on nuclear
      missions and inside nuclear mission exclusion areas.
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                      21


        2.8.2.1.1. Individuals requesting MEP authorization will provide the approving
        authority, their Social Security Number (SSN), security clearance, Personnel
        Reliability Program (PRP) status, specific mission for which MEP is requested, and
        reason for participating in the mission. MEP’s requiring escort by the PNAF crew
        must provide notification to the operating wing a minimum of ten days prior to home
        station departure. This ensures escort officials are properly added to the mission and
        are prepared to execute their duties IAW the mission plan. MEPs will be kept to a
        minimum.
        2.8.2.1.2. MEP procedures and approval will be IAW AFI 11-401. MEP authority is
        granted for specific individuals on specific missions. MEP authority will not be used
        as blanket approval on all nuclear airlift missions nor will it constitute personnel
        travel clearance required by the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide. Inspector and
        observer lists will be approved by AMC/A3 after coordination through AMC/A3N.
        Lists may remain valid for up to a year, and must be renewed annually or when
        personnel changes dictate.
        2.8.2.1.3. Classify requests appropriately if a specific mission or location is included.
        Approve requests for MEP based on security clearance, need-to-know, space
        available on the aircraft, and valid in-flight or ground duty to perform.
        2.8.2.1.4. Without a specific in-flight duty, individuals requesting MEP to observe
        onload and offload operations will not be approved if any other transportation is
        available.
        2.8.2.1.5. Commanders of tasked operating wings and NAFs may authorize MEP
        status for people under their command. All others must be approved by AMC/A3.
        2.8.2.1.6. AMC/A3 validated MEP letters will be transmitted via message from
        AMC/A3N, and approved by the owning PNAF Operations Group Commander.
     2.8.2.2. IAW AFI 11-401, the PNAF Operations Group Commander is the final authority
     of MEP status on nuclear airlift missions operated by their wing. MEPs must be on
     official orders, and fall into the following categories:
        2.8.2.2.1. Commanders, supervisors of PNAF aircrews and related programs: Vice
        commanders, operations group commanders, deputy operations group commanders,
        and PNAF squadron/unit commanders and operations officers.
        2.8.2.2.2. PNAF certified aircrew flight examiners from the operating PNAF parent

22                                                               AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


        inspections/observations. Note: AFIA, AMC/IG, DTRA, USSTRATCOM, and
        AMC/SEW offices are responsible for distributing and maintaining current
        authorization letters. Updated letters will be sent via email which have been digitally
        signed to AMC/A3N, 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD, 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG and 4
        AS/DOOMS offices as soon as changes occur to ensure authenticity.
     2.8.2.3. MEP authorization (individual orders or MAJCOM/NAF message) will have the
     approval authority, security clearance, SSAN, mission number, and reason for
     participating in the mission. Orders will not specify a particular mission number.
     Classified mission details will be transmitted via classified means (i.e. SIPRnet, Secure
     Fax, etc.).
     2.8.2.4. Persons traveling as MEP will be briefed by the operating squadron/unit (or
     Aircraft Commander when joining the mission en route) on specific mission information
     needed to accomplish their assigned task. Briefing will include familiarization on
     applicable security and safety standards and emergency procedures.
     2.8.2.5. MEPs must be positively identified by a service or agency official identification
     card.
     2.8.2.6. The aircrew Courier must verify the MEP’s PRP status prior to executing the
     tasked mission. Certified individuals must have an appropriate annotation in their MEP
     authorization. A valid Two-Person Concept (TPC) team must escort individuals not
     certified under PRP.
     2.8.2.7. Travel orders for MEPs will cite the MEP authority and be presented to aircrew
     before mission operation.
     2.8.2.8. MEP authority provides direct access to the mission aircraft without processing
     through passenger service section; therefore, the aircrew is responsible for manifest and
     anti-hijacking procedures for MEPs. The Loadmaster will annotate all MEPs on a DD
     Form 2131, Passenger Manifest.
     2.8.2.9. MEPs on PRP status and designated by the aircrew Courier may be authorized
     unescorted entry into the restricted area around the aircraft. MEPs certified under PRP
     and knowledgeable in the task to be performed may be used as part of a two-person team.
     2.8.2.10. MEP verification. Aircraft commanders will not allow anyone to fly on a
     nuclear mission unless they are convinced of the person's identity and the legality of their
     authorization.
        2.8.2.10.1. If there is any doubt or suspicion, regardless of rank or position,
        diplomatically but firmly deny access to the aircraft and cargo.
        2.8.2.10.2. Unless an MEP is personally known, do not accept just a set of orders as
        authorization. Verify and confirm the orders through other channels. For example,
        MAJCOM IG, AFIA, AFSEC, DTRA, and AMC Nuclear Surety inspectors are
        identified on a master inspector’s list/letter that is carried in the aircraft nuclear
        mission kit. If required the Aircraft Commander will call outside offices for
        verification.

   2.8.3. Flying Crew Chiefs (FCC). Flying crew chiefs are not normally required on PNAF
   missions. FCCs may be scheduled on nuclear missions at the discretion of the PNAF wing
   commander.
      2.8.3.1. FCCs need not be PRP-certified, but must possess a final Secret security
      clearance. Ensure PRP status is noted on the aircrew entry authority list (EAL).
      2.8.3.2. FCCs will attend the squadron/unit's nuclear mission briefing. The FCC will be
      briefed individually by the nuclear airlift monitor or designated representative before
      attending the nuclear mission briefing. This briefing must cover security precautions and
      no-lone zone procedures in sufficient detail to prevent inadvertent violations by the FCC.
      Stress nuclear safety precautions to include specific precautions in Chapter 8.
      2.8.3.3. FCCs will not seal mission aircraft, nor will they be allowed unescorted access
      to aircraft containing nuclear or nuclear-related cargo. Do not leave the FCC in sole
      custody of the aircrew mission kit or aircrew sidearms. Exception: When servicing and
      maintenance are required, the FCC may seal empty nuclear mission aircraft. Aircraft will
      be sanitized before subsequent loading of nuclear cargo.
2.9. PNAF Structure.
   2.9.1. PNAF is composed of specially selected and trained aircrews assigned to PNAF-
   certified wings that have passed an initial nuclear surety inspection and meet the recurring
   inspection and training requirements for nuclear surety.
   2.9.2. PNAF-certified wings will maintain a prescribed number of qualified aircrews as
   determined by their respective MAJCOM. The PNAF Operations Group Commander will
   notify AMC/A3T and AMC/A3N when PNAF crew force falls below the wing’s Designed
   Operational Capability (DOC) required levels. Attached crewmembers may be PNAF-
   qualified and counted towards the number of crews at the squadron/unit commander's
   discretion.
2.10. PNAF Aircrew Qualification and Certification.
   2.10.1. Flying Qualifications: Crewmembers who occupy a primary PNAF crew position
   when nuclear cargo is airlifted will be qualified according to AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 2, C-17

 Note 3. Squadron/unit commanders will ensure the appropriate crew complement is assigned
 to meet mission requirements IAW applicable portions of this instruction and AFI 11-2C-17,
 Vol 3.
 Note 4. List authorized Courier officers in the Mission Setup Message. Do not annotate on the
 flight authorization.
 Note 5. An additional PRP-certified crewmember will be assigned on missions requiring the
 Two-Person Concept (TPC).
2.12. Aircrew Replacement, Staging, and Crew Swap.
   2.12.1. Do not replace PNAF crewmembers unless absolutely necessary. Avoiding Courier
   replacement is especially critical due to briefing requirements, letters of introduction, Courier
   identification, and custody receipt. See Chapter 6 for specific procedures if a Courier is
   replaced.
   2.12.2. Aircrew Staging. Pre-position PNAF aircrews at forward/en route locations to
   maximize throughput in large scale (multi-mission) movements. This practice eliminates
   pre-and de-positioning legs. It may involve swapping aircrews at an en route location with
   nuclear cargo aboard, but will not involve handling of nuclear cargo at the en route location
   used. All planned stage crews will participate in the predeparture briefing at home station
   IAW paragraph 3.2. During execution, crewmembers will brief counterparts on unique
   mission aspects not covered during the predeparture mission briefing.
   2.12.3. Crew Swap. A crew swap is defined as using pre-positioned crews to initiate or
   complete a nuclear mission. This option may only be used when absolutely necessary to
   avoid crew duty day waivers, to maximize surety, and only after all normal scheduling
   options are exhausted.
      2.12.3.1. When used prior to mission departure, a pre-positioned crew may pre-flight,
      pre-position the aircraft, and onload nuclear cargo via normal procedures. The pre-
      positioned crew will then transfer custody of the cargo and mission responsibilities over
      to the main operating crew to execute the primary mission segment.
      2.12.3.2. When used after mission arrival, a pre-positioned crew may receive custody of
      nuclear cargo and mission responsibilities from the primary crew then offload the cargo,
      post-flight, and re-position the aircraft as necessary via normal procedures.
      2.12.3.3. Additional crews (either swapped or pending swap) may not deadhead with
      nuclear cargo aboard or remain in the restricted area during loading/unloading operations.
      2.12.3.4. Mission planning. Mission planners will ensure all primary and supporting
      installation agencies are coordinated with when determining Crew Swap SOEs and
      procedures for a particular mission.
          2.12.3.4.1. Unit mission planners will ensure the appropriate number of PNAF crews
          are scheduled to complete the mission.
          2.12.3.4.2. Create a separate EAL for each crew. All crewmembers from each crew
          will be listed on each EAL. The EALs will annotate the Aircraft Commander and
          Sole Vouching Authority (SVA) for each respective crew. Example: One EAL will
          annotate the upload crew’s Aircraft Commander/SVA and the other will annotate the
26                                                             AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


        main operating crew’s Aircraft Commander/SVA. Both EALs will list all
        crewmembers from the upload and operating crews. Crews will depart home station
        with only their crew’s EAL.
        2.12.3.4.3. Create one set of crew orders that includes all crews. Ensure appropriate
        remarks are made on orders as to when the respective Aircraft Commander will
        assume command. Each crew will depart home station with the same set of orders.
        2.12.3.4.4. All planned swap crews will participate in the predeparture briefing at
        home station IAW paragraph 3.2. During execution, crewmembers will brief
        counterparts on unique mission aspects not covered during the predeparture mission
        briefing.
     2.12.3.5. During execution, only one crew may be in the exclusion area during the
     handling of the nuclear cargo between the crew and the logistics installation personnel.
     Example: Upon arrival at download location with engines shutdown, the operating
     crew’s Courier will receive the security briefing, authenticate the operating crew’s EAL,
     and process the download crew into the area. Both crews will enter the aircraft,
     provide/receive mission, aircraft, security, and cargo briefings, transfer sidearms,
     classified material and equipment, CDS codes, and nuclear cargo. The operating crew
     will proceed to the ECP with the download crew’s Courier. The operating crew’s
     Courier will collect all previously authenticated EALs from the EC and brief the EC that
     the download Courier is now the SVA. The download Courier will authenticate the
     download crew’s EAL, outprocess the operating crew, and authenticate all guest EALs.
     The download crew will perform the remaining of the download as normal.
     2.12.3.6. PNAF crews will use AMC/A3N developed checklist(s) to aid in crew swap
     mission planning and execution.
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                      27

3.5. Personal Requirements. Each PNAF crewmember will carry a copy of AFI 13526 on all
nuclear missions. Additionally, each Loadmaster will carry a copy of T.O. 1C-17A-16-1 on all
nuclear missions.
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                       31


                                           Chapter 4

                                 EN ROUTE OPERATIONS

4.1. General. This Chapter outlines en route operational procedures to be used by aircrews and
command and control centers (CCC). Included are procedures for communications, cargo
loading and offloading, aircraft emergency diverts, and crew rest.
4.2. Special Considerations When Transporting Nuclear Cargo.
   4.2.1. Aircraft transporting nuclear cargo are prohibited from approaching within an unsafe
   distance of unfriendly border. Positive measures will be used to prevent overflight or landing
   in unfriendly territories or countries where such actions are prohibited. Refer to the SWOG
   for additional information.
   4.2.2. To the maximum extent possible, avoid flying over populated areas. Approach,
   landing, and takeoff tracks are excluded from this limitation. If in the Aircraft Commander's
   judgment, a request to avoid heavily populated areas would place aircraft in greater danger
   by conflicting with traffic in crowded airspace, comply with air traffic control (ATC) normal
   routings. Be careful of ATC instructions that may cause flight into unauthorized areas. Do
   not reveal the purpose of the mission merely to proceed via flight-planned route.
   4.2.3. Aircrew members shall not consume alcoholic beverages within 12 hours of crew
   show time on active legs carrying nuclear cargo.
   4.2.4. Current and qualified PNAF Aircraft Commander certified pilots may perform the
   takeoff and landing on nuclear cargo-laden missions, provided the designated PNAF mission
   Aircraft Commander is occupying the other seat.
   4.2.5. Keep the time nuclear cargo is outside secure storage to a minimum. Coordinate fully
   with support agencies, shippers, and receivers. Keep them informed of mission progress and
   intentions.
   4.2.6. When nuclear cargo is aboard, do not land early unless absolutely necessary and base
   agencies have been notified. If a takeoff at the published departure time would generate an
   early arrival (due to unexpected en route winds, etc.), stay on the ground where security is
   known and established. Coordinate with proper CCC and 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD for
   later takeoff time. If an early arrival cannot be avoided en route, ensure mission
   requirements are passed to the arrival base and are completely understood. Get confirmation
   (names, initials, etc.) from the destination that the requirements are received and will be
   coordinated. At a minimum, ensure the security forces have been notified and can provide
   support. If possible inform 618 AOC (TACC)/XOC and 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD of the
   early arrival.
   4.2.7. Security Alternate Fuel. When fuel planning for nuclear and nuclear-related mission
   segments, include sufficient fuel (10,000 pounds for C-17) to permit departure from
   destination and climb to an appropriate altitude to level off with "required overhead" fuel.
   List this fuel in the "stored fuel" on the appropriate fuel planning form according to AFI 11-
   2C-17, Vol 3. Security alternate fuel is designed for all missions to allow the Aircraft
   Commander the option of departure from an immature or deteriorating security situation.
   This is in addition to all other required fuel. Do not offload nuclear or nuclear-related cargo
 32                                                                  AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


      to allow for security alternate fuel. General cargo will be offloaded to allow for security
      alternate fuel.
   4.2.8. Flight Planning. Enter "hazardous cargo," "inert devices," or both if applicable and
   the mission number in the "remarks" section of the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, or in
   the "other information" section of the DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan. Note:
   LLCs with line numbers and certain Type 3 trainers and JTAs are hazardous cargo.
   4.2.9. On air refueled mission segments, use the pre-coordinated emergency divert location
   designated in the Mission Setup Message if at all possible. If a different emergency divert
   location is necessary, inform the controlling CCC as soon as possible so the duty controller
   can advise the new emergency divert location. Before takeoff, the Aircraft Commander must
   ensure the new emergency divert location confirms security is available.
   4.2.10. Aircraft Firefighting Support Requirements when transporting, loading or unloading
   nuclear cargo or nuclear-related cargo:
         4.2.10.1. Fire protection during engine starts, servicing, taxi, takeoff and landing will be
         provided in accordance with T.O. 11N-20-11 or Engineering Liaison Office Publication 1
         (ELO-1) for host nation fire departments.
         4.2.10.2. At Air Force bases, do not display hazardous cargo placards (explosives
         category 1.1, etc.). The host will determine use of placards at other bases.
4.3. Aircraft Preparation.
   4.3.1. Do not service or perform aircraft maintenance during nuclear cargo loading or
   unloading operations (concurrent servicing). Refer to AFI 91-115 for specific aircraft
   maintenance requirements and considerations. The nuclear cargo convoy will not normally
   depart the storage site until the aircraft is serviced, security is established, and the aircrew is
   ready for loading.
   4.3.2. Ensure appropriate T.O. 1C-17A-16-1 and T.O. 1C-17A-9, Loading Instructions,
   preloading checklists are complete prior to commencing onload of nuclear cargo.
   4.3.3. During loading, offloading and servicing, fire protection must be provided according
   to T.O. 11N-20-11.
   4.3.4. The necessary aerospace ground equipment (AGE) and support equipment will be pre-
   positioned at the designated parking area before aircraft arrival. The equipment will be
   inspected for serviceability, fully serviced, and sanitized before placement at the parking
   area. Ensure AGE equipment is positioned so that it does not block taxi routes or avenues of
   exit for the aircraft.
4.4. Two-Person Concept (TPC). See AFI 91-104, Nuclear Surety Tamper Control and
Detection Program, for TPC and no-lone zone guidance and DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-
108, Volume 3, Enclosure 9 for exclusion area guidance.
   4.4.1. Aircrews will apply TPC when airlifting nuclear cargo. As the Sole Vouching
   Authority (SVA), the aircrew Courier will ensure an exclusion area is established, aircrew
   and security personnel are briefed on exclusion area procedures and individual
   responsibilities, and enforce TPC. While it is the Courier’s primary responsibility,
   compliance and enforcement are everyone's concern regardless of who has physical
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                        33


   possession of nuclear cargo. Note: An individual may enter a lavatory within an exclusion
   area without continuous direct observation by the remaining TPC team.
   4.4.2. Individual TPC team members must be certified under their respective service-
   directed PRP and thoroughly briefed on the location of the exclusion area. They must be
   familiar with the safety and security requirements of the task to be performed. The TPC
   team must be a minimum of two PRP-certified individuals. Two interim certified individuals
   will not form a TPC team.
   4.4.3. A TPC team will escort persons not certified under PRP and comply with applicable
   escort ratios IAW AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108.
   Non-PRP individuals will be kept to a minimum, taking into account the nuclear cargo,
   mission complexity, crew work/rest cycles, expected visitor activity, and ability to effectively
   control all visitors. It is the Courier’s responsibility to ensure anyone who has access,
   understands and complies with the rules in the exclusion area.
   4.4.4. Two-Person Concept for Inspectors:
       4.4.4.1. Upon proper identification and authentication of inspector’s EAL, PRP-certified
       inspectors may be authorized unescorted entry into the restricted area by the aircrew
       Courier.
       4.4.4.2. During an inspection, a PRP-certified inspector will not form a TPC team with
       an inspectee. PRP-certified inspectors will form an independent TPC team to ensure the
       inspection doesn’t impact the aircrew performance of duties.
4.5. Cargo Acceptance and Transfer.
   4.5.1. The Courier will accept and transfer custody of nuclear cargo in accordance with T.O.
   11N-45-51 and Chapter 6. Only nuclear cargo identified in the Mission Setup Message and
   Airlift Request may be accepted and handled. If cargo differs from the Mission Setup
   Message and Airlift Request, follow procedures IAW paragraph 2.7.3.
   4.5.2. Aircrew will not accept opportune or non-nuclear cargo on PNAF SAAMs without
   prior MAJCOM coordination through AFNWC/NCL. AFNWC/NCL will provide this to 618
   AOC (TACC) via AFNWC/NCL SAAM Airlift Request which in turn will be published in
   the Mission Set-up Message.
   4.5.3. Custody and Physical Possession. Custody of nuclear cargo is transferred upon
   signing the DD Form 1911 regardless of physical possession. The Courier and
   shipper/receiver will agree on when custody transfer occurs. Possession occurs at the pre-
   determined point when the aircrew or receiver physically “takes” each individual piece of
   cargo. Munitions personnel assisting in loading operations do so under the control of and on
   behalf of the Courier. Before the transfer begins, the Courier, shipper or receiver, and the
   Senior SF representative (SNCO or Officer) will agree on where each piece of cargo will go
   in case of attack, e.g., if cargo chains are broken, the cargo may be brought aboard for
   defense. The Courier is responsible for the safety and security of each item in their physical
   possession regardless of custody, and conversely, the Courier still has custody of items
   regardless of physical possession.
4.6. Loading and Offloading Procedures. Nuclear cargo will be loaded only on a mission
capable aircraft serviced and prepared for loading. The aircrew is responsible for safe and proper
 34                                                               AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


loading of nuclear cargo. The Aircraft Commander will personally monitor all loading
operations of nuclear cargo by direct reference to T.O 1C-17A-16-1 or T.O 1C-17A-16-1CL-1.
Note: Do not load nuclear cargo on PNAF aircraft unless a loading procedure is published in
T.O 1C-17A-16-1.
   4.6.1. The primary mission Loadmaster, in coordination with the Aircraft Commander, will
   direct loading, tie down, load distribution, and shipping preparation of nuclear cargo.
   4.6.2. Use T.O. 1C-17A-16-1 or T.O. 1C-17A-9 procedures for loading and offloading. The
   appropriate T.O. by type of cargo is specified in T.O. 11N-45-51A (S-RD) and Attachment 2.
   No deviations to these T.O. procedures are authorized. Weapon configurations will be as
   directed for shipment in the weapon dash -1 T.O. (S-RD).
   4.6.3. Before each onload and offload, the Aircraft Commander and primary mission
   Loadmaster will ensure everyone understands their duties. Shippers or receivers may be
   asked to help, but will be thoroughly briefed and must comply with AMC aircrew procedures
   while cargo is in the crew’s custody or physical possession.
   4.6.4. Use nuclear weapon protective covers as much as possible to minimize visual
   exposure. Host installations shall consider prohibiting restricted area photography for force
   protection or OPSEC concerns. If local installations prohibit photography, procedures for
   gaining photography authorization will be included in the installation defense plan.
   4.6.5. Aircrew may touch nuclear cargo as necessary to facilitate onload, offload, and
   inflight duties IAW T.O. 1C-17A-16-1, T.O. 1C-17A-9, and T.O. 11N-45-51A (S-RD).
   Avoid excessive handling of nuclear cargo. Handle only one item or package of nuclear
   cargo at a time. When hand-carrying, use both hands if practical.
   4.6.6. Forecast or actual inclement weather (high winds, ice storms, etc.).
      4.6.6.1. Onload and offload may be delayed due to local policies or the Aircraft
      Commander's judgment.
      4.6.6.2. Do not load nuclear cargo containing explosives when an electrical storm is
      within 5 miles unless cargo would be safer inside aircraft.
      4.6.6.3. During the shipper’s brief, the Courier and MASO will coordinate procedures
      establishing custody and security of nuclear cargo when the aircraft is partially
      on/offloaded and weather has temporarily ceased operations.
   4.6.7. Aircraft Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) should only be used if a sufficient power cart is
   not available, if required for avionics cooling, or to heat the aircraft in cold weather.
   4.6.8. Maintain a 30-inch space between general or nuclear-related cargo and the nearest
   nuclear cargo.
   4.6.9. Loadmaster will determine what cargo is jettisonable. This is a physical determination
   with reference to limitations of AFMAN 24-204(I), T.O. 1C-17A-16-1 or T.O. 1C-17A-9.
   Loadmaster will ensure crew is aware of all cargo that is non-jettisonable.
4.7. Ground Emergencies.
   4.7.1. Anyone observing an unsafe act or condition during any ground phase of the nuclear
   mission will immediately stop the operation. Correct the condition before operations are
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                      35


  resumed. Report all ground emergencies to the On-Scene Coordinator (OSC). While the
  aircraft commander retains responsibility for the aircraft, the OSC is responsible for
  coordinating incident response actions and will integrate into the installation Incident
  Command System (ICS) structure.
     4.7.1.1. If an accident occurs during handling and the case remains intact, notify the local
     safety office and evacuate non-essential personnel as briefed. Do not ship items which
     have been exposed to abnormal conditions unless specifically authorized.
     4.7.1.2. If nuclear cargo is dropped or otherwise damaged during handling and the case
     is ruptured, take the following steps immediately:
         4.7.1.2.1. Coordinate emergency actions through the OSC, security forces, and fire
         department. Notify tower or ground control requesting them to notify the local
         support United States EOD team immediately and declare a ground emergency.
         4.7.1.2.2. Evacuate nonessential persons upwind, if possible, a minimum of 2,500
         feet or as briefed.
  4.7.2. Security Emergencies. Coordination and planning prior to mission arrival and during
  initial communications between the aircrew and Senior Security Forces Representative (SSR)
  are essential to ensure security of nuclear cargo. The Nuclear Weapon Security Standard will
  be maintained, which is: denial of unauthorized access to nuclear weapons; preventing loss
  of custody; and preventing, to the maximum extent possible, radiological contamination
  caused by unauthorized acts.
     4.7.2.1. If confronted with hostile force, deadly force is authorized to protect nuclear
     cargo. Resist any attempt by a hostile force to capture nuclear cargo to the fullest extent
     possible.
     4.7.2.2. Consider any attack on aircraft loaded with nuclear cargo, including a hijacking
     attempt, as an attack against nuclear cargo.
     4.7.2.3. Should hostages be used to gain access to, as cover for removal, or to thwart
     recovery of nuclear cargo, the welfare and safety of hostages should be considered in
     determining actions to be taken. However, the presence of hostages shall not deter taking
     decisive, prompt, and effective action that includes using deadly force to recover nuclear
     cargo and to prevent unauthorized access to or removal of nuclear cargo.
     4.7.2.4. If attacked, take the following actions:
         4.7.2.4.1. If attack occurs during onload or offload, execute the plan as briefed
         between crew and SSR. If the decision is made to load, then load the nuclear cargo as
         fast and as safely as possible.
         4.7.2.4.2. If the Aircraft Commander determines the aircraft is airworthy and the taxi
         and departure routes are safer than remaining in place, attempt to make an immediate
         takeoff with the cargo IAW predetermined courses of action with the SSR.
  4.7.3. Some weapons have a command disable system (CDS) that internally destroys the
  capability of a weapon to achieve a significant nuclear yield.
 36                                                                  AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


         4.7.3.1. CDS codes and at least one individual knowledgeable in CDS procedures will
         remain on the aircraft until Type I security is established after arrival and when ropes and
         stanchions are removed until departure.
         4.7.3.2. CDS is the only disablement procedure PNAF aircrews are authorized to use.
         4.7.3.3. CDS authorization, protection of codes, and procedures for execution will be
         IAW T.O. 11N-45-51 and AFI 21-205(S).
4.8. Procedures for Crossload Transfer of Nuclear Cargo. An aircraft change may be
necessary during a nuclear airlift mission due to maintenance or other unforeseen problems.
This could occur at home station, en route, or at an emergency divert location. Aircraft change
may require a crossload of the nuclear cargo to keep it moving to its final destination. In the
event such a transfer must occur, the following procedures will help ensure a safe, secure transfer
of nuclear cargo from one aircraft to another.
      4.8.1. Whenever possible, crossloads will be performed by personnel who are trained and
      certified for handling and transportation tasks IAW AFI 21-204, Nuclear Weapons
      Maintenance Procedures. In emergency divert situations where no certified personnel are
      present, PNAF aircrew members are authorized to perform PNAF aircraft crossloads
      according to AFI 91-115.
      4.8.2. Do not begin crossload of nuclear cargo until the replacement aircraft has been fully
      configured, fueled, preflighted, sanitized, and appropriate security requirements are in place.
      4.8.3. One PNAF Courier will maintain custody of the nuclear cargo throughout the
      crossload. Any transfer of custody will occur before or after the crossload.
      4.8.4. PNAF aircrew will ensure the safest and most secure environment for any nuclear
      cargo involved in the crossload. Use nuclear weapon protective covers as much as possible
      to minimize visual exposure. The covers will be removed immediately prior to inspecting
      weapons and subsequently commencing loading/offloading operations for each individual
      weapon (when the aircrew takes possession of each weapon).
      4.8.5. Use a single Protection Level 1 (restricted) area around the two aircraft to the
      maximum extent possible. Receiving aircraft will be sanitized according to requirements in
      Chapter 5 before being parked in the same Type I area as the broken aircraft.
      4.8.6. Aircrew will be responsible for the transfer operation. They will work closely with
      the base commander or on-scene coordinator, shipper or receiver, munitions, security,
      intelligence, and transportation personnel.
      4.8.7. The Aircraft Commander and Courier will conduct briefings with all personnel
      participating in aircraft crossload. The briefings will include an overview of the crossload
      operation and each participant will be briefed on individual duties. The Courier officer will
      brief security, cargo, and no-lone zone requirements. The primary Loadmaster will brief
      loading/offloading duties as required during the operation.
      4.8.8. The Courier will coordinate with the SSR to ensure security requirements are
      understood and security is adequate before commencing the crossload operation. The
      Courier will also ensure the no-lone zones are briefed and understood by all participants.
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                           37


   4.8.9. Use T.O. 1C-17A-16-1 or T.O. 1C-17A-9 procedures for loading and offloading. The
   appropriate T.O. by type of cargo is specified in T.O. 11N-45-51A (S-RD) and Attachment 2.
   No deviations to these T.O. procedures are authorized. Weapon configurations will be as
   directed for shipment in the weapon dash -1 T.O. (S-RD).
   4.8.10. If PNAF aircrew transfers cargo to a new aircraft and crew, the original aircrew is
   responsible for offloading, and the new crew is responsible for loading the new aircraft. The
   new aircrew will have custody of nuclear cargo at the time of transfer in writing on the DD
   Form 1911. The original aircrew will maintain physical possession and responsibility for
   each item during offload until physically transferred to the accepting aircrew during onload.
   Couriers will ensure everyone in the loading and offloading process clearly understands who
   is in charge of each item and its disposition at all times.
      4.8.10.1. The primary Loadmaster of the new aircraft, with coordination of the Aircraft
      Commander, will direct the nuclear cargo movement operation to the new aircraft.
4.9. Departure Procedures.
   4.9.1. Destination Support Confirmation.
      4.9.1.1. Aircraft with nuclear cargo aboard must not take off until all destinations and
      pre-coordinated emergency divert locations acknowledge that they are capable of meeting
      security requirements.
      4.9.1.2. Before beginning each day's operation, check with the MAJCOM CCC for the
      status of stations to be transited that day. CCC will review the mission folder to ensure
      all stations on the day's itinerary have confirmed security and support requirements.
      CCC will use all other sources available, e.g., airfield threat security evaluations file, etc.,
      to evaluate the security status of en route stations. CCC must be prepared to rapidly
      appraise security for a nuclear mission and provide any changes to the crew immediately.
      If security is questionable or a 24-Hour confirmation of support message has not been
      received, CCC will immediately attempt to confirm security, holding departure to the
      suspect station until security is confirmed. If the 24-Hour confirmation of support
      message is not available, call the destination base directly. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD
      can help provide base contacts and telephone numbers.
   4.9.2. Engine-Start Notification. Before engine-start, the PNAF aircrew will give the
   controlling agency (ground or tower) the parking location, approximate engine-start time,
   and announce there is hazardous cargo aboard the aircraft. Ensure a fire truck is standing by,
   in accordance with T.O. 11N-20-11.
   4.9.3. Release of Security. When directed by the Aircraft Commander, the Courier officer
   will direct security guards to remove any barriers outlining the restricted area. The security
   force will maintain surveillance of the aircraft until it is airborne and be available for recall
   30 minutes thereafter, or as otherwise coordinated in the Mission Setup Message.
   4.9.4. Departure Message:
      4.9.4.1. Once airborne, the aircrew will contact the CCC directly via aircraft radio or
      phone patch with their departure time and estimated time of arrival (ETA).
      4.9.4.2. CCC will notify destination point of contact (identified in their acknowledgment
      message) by the most expeditious means available and pass aircraft type, mission
 38                                                                   AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


         number, tail number, and ETA. Insist security forces be notified. If CCC is unable to
         contact destination, they will advise the Aircraft Commander. The Aircraft Commander
         will make the final decision to land or divert to a pre-coordinated emergency divert
         location. If there is a reasonable doubt the security of nuclear cargo could be jeopardized
         if the aircraft lands, divert to a suitable alternate that can provide security. Note: OPSEC
         procedures are extremely important during this process. Make every effort to avoid
         "signatures" of a nuclear cargo mission. Avoid discussions that could reveal the purpose
         of the mission.
         4.9.4.3. For missions with short en route times or several quick stops that would make
         departure calls to destinations impractical, CCC may phone destinations before aircraft is
         airborne.
4.10. CCC Coordination.
      4.10.1. The PNAF aircrew must keep 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG advised of mission
      progress. If ETA changes by more than 15 minutes, the arrival destination must be informed
      as soon as possible.
      4.10.2. Releasing Pre-coordinated Emergency Divert Locations.
         4.10.2.1. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD will develop Mission Setup Message support
         requirements for applicable pre-coordinated emergency divert locations. Bases will be
         tasked to support the unlikely event of an emergency divert for any reason (ex: Weather,
         A/R, maintenance, etc.). 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD will coordinate with the operating
         unit during mission planning to establish standby posture requirements and key time
         points/related mission milestones (completion of A/R, ETP passage, etc.).
         4.10.2.2. The Aircraft Commander will contact the 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2
         when passed the key time points/related mission milestones. Upon concurrence with the
         Aircraft Commander, 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2 will contact the pre-coordinated
         emergency divert location command post to release the installation’s standby
         requirements.
      4.10.3. Aircraft Divert. The Aircraft Commander will inform 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG as
      soon as possible after coordinating any divert with air traffic control agencies. 618 AOC
      (TACC)/XOCG will notify the pre-coordinated emergency divert location, appropriate en
      route agencies, host nation authorities, and the original destination to advise them the aircraft
      is diverting.
4.11. Arrival Procedures.
      4.11.1. In-Flight Notification:
         4.11.1.1. At least 30-minutes before ETA, contact one of the following in this order:
         (1) command post, (2) base operations, or (3) control tower. If required, pass the SAAM
         number and verify the base is prepared for the aircraft arrival. Request the ETA be
         passed to appropriate support agencies, including the agency specified as single point-of-
         contact in the security acknowledgment message.
         4.11.1.2. If the arrival base does not have hazardous cargo information, request the
         following be relayed immediately to the crash-fire protection agency and other support
         agencies as appropriate:
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                      39


          4.11.1.2.1. Aircraft call sign, type, and mission number.
          4.11.1.2.2. ETA.
          4.11.1.2.3. DoD explosives hazard class and division.
          4.11.1.2.4. Request for special handling (isolated parking, security, etc.).
          4.11.1.2.5. Line numbers (if requested).
       4.11.1.3. On legs with no hazardous cargo aboard, pass the call sign, mission number,
       and any special requests to the appropriate agency at least 30-minutes before ETA.
   4.11.2. Taxi and Parking. It is the Aircraft Commander's responsibility to make host airfield
   operations aware of the need for isolated parking. It is a host base responsibility to ensure
   the taxi route and parking spot meet the quantity-distance separation requirements of
   AFMAN 91201, Explosives Safety Standards, and T.O. 11N­45­51A (S-RD). An explosive
   (nuclear)-laden aircraft is classified as an above ground unbarricaded storage magazine.
   4.11.3. Arrival Message. Contact CCC with unclassified arrival information as soon as
   possible after landing. CCC will dispatch arrival message. The Aircraft Commander will
   ensure land times have been transmitted to appropriate C2 facilities as soon as possible after
   landing (verify via local AMCCs/CPs or confirmation the aircraft’s automated reporting
   system has sent both and ‘On the Deck’ and ‘In Blocks’ notifications). If notification is in
   question or has not been sent, contact CCC with unclassified arrival information as soon as
   possible after landing. CCC will dispatch arrival message.
   4.11.4. Security. Immediately upon block-in, the Courier designated aircrew members will
   deplane. Keep doors closed and delay preparation for nuclear cargo transfer until adequate
   security is established IAW DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108. Note: If security forces
   do not meet the aircraft, the Aircraft Commander must decide whether the nuclear cargo
   would be more secure airborne. Consider such factors as fuel aboard, weather, local air
   traffic density, local security threat, and prospects for obtaining proper security support
   within a reasonable time. If necessary, depart destination base and orbit overhead until
   assured of proper security support or divert.
       4.11.4.1. The Courier and security forces will confirm the DTGs of the Security Briefing
       Worksheets and local threat assessment (see paragraph 5.10). Only brief applicable
       changes and any schedule changes, maintenance problems, or any other situation that will
       affect loading times, convoy times, or security status. Any questions about forms or
       cargo will be resolved before accepting cargo.
       4.11.4.2. Ensure all agencies supporting the mission are informed of the sequence of
       ground operations.
   4.11.5. On-Scene Coordinator. The Aircraft Commander or Courier will meet the On Scene
   Coordinator (OSC) after security is established.
4.12. Divert to Alternate Airfield.
   4.12.1. Refer to the SWOG for additional guidance on divert locations, unscheduled landing,
   and inadvertent overflight procedures. If controlling CCC determines security at destination
   is inadequate, they will contact aircrew by the most expeditious means and direct divert to a
40                                                                 AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


     location with adequate security. If security is questionable, a decision to continue to
     destination should be based on host-theater logistics and security forces concurrence.
  4.12.2. If pre-coordinated emergency divert locations cannot be used or as listed in the
  SWOG, alternate locations may be considered according to the SWOG priority and the
  following:
        4.12.2.1. Be under US military control.
        4.12.2.2. Have adequate security. DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108 and the SWOG
        contain additional information on security guidance for PNAF emergency diverts.
        4.12.2.3. Should have a nuclear storage capability. Consider the type of cargo to be
        handled, e.g. Army units are not certified to handle and maintain Air Force nuclear
        weapons. Every attempt should be made to store nuclear cargo on the aircraft while at
        non-nuclear emergency divert location or at a location without nuclear storage capacity
        during entire ground time. This might be unacceptable from a security, maintenance, or
        host base or theater point of view.
     4.12.3. Ensure the route to be flown to the divert location is compatible with the SWOG.
  4.12.4. If aircraft maintenance is the cause or a contributing factor for an emergency divert,
  consider maintenance capability at the alternate location. Security support and possible
  nuclear storage capability are the most important factors.
  4.12.5. If the divert location is in CONUS or a US military base in a foreign country, use
  procedures in the SWOG as well as the following additional guidance:
        4.12.5.1. Have controlling CCC relay hazardous cargo information and coordinate
        arrangements for security, storage, etc. Give 30­minute in-flight notification.
        4.12.5.2. If unable to contact CCC or if CCC cannot contact alternate base, request
        security forces meet the aircraft in the 30-minute notification call.
  4.12.6. If the airfield is in a foreign country, but not under US military control, contact
  controlling CCC and relay the aircraft call sign, mission number, aircraft type, airport of
  intended landing, ETA, and reason for the emergency divert. Request assistance from
  nearest Air Force base, American Embassy, or consulate. Landing in any foreign country is
  extremely sensitive and will be handled as quietly as possible with the agency controlling the
  field. Keep mission as inconspicuous as possible while still protecting nuclear cargo. Use
  procedures in the DoD FCG to protect the sensitivity, which states, "US military aircraft are
  sovereign instrumentalities.” When cleared to overfly or land in foreign territory, it is US
  policy to assert that military aircraft are entitled to privileges and immunities which
  customarily are accorded warships. These privileges and immunities include, in the absence
  of stipulations to the contrary: exemption from duties and taxation; immunity from search,
  seizure, and inspections (including customs and safety inspections); or other exercise of
  jurisdiction by the host nation over aircraft, personnel, equipment, or cargo aboard.
        4.12.6.1. Air Force Aircraft Commanders will not authorize search, seizure, inspection,
        or similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by
        direction of Air Force headquarters or the American Embassy in the country concerned.
        Diplomatically, but firmly, deny any access to aircraft by foreign officials and attempt to
        have US officials in the country resolve the problem.
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                      41


4.13. Emergency Procedures. During any emergency, aircrew must take every precaution to
protect lives and property. The following emergency procedures apply:
   4.13.1. Pass the following information to appropriate ATC agency and request it be passed
   to the divert location:
      4.13.1.1. Aircraft call sign, nature of the emergency and landing intentions.
      4.13.1.2. Aircraft position and ETA to destination.
      4.13.1.3. Number of personnel aboard.
      4.13.1.4. Fuel aboard.
      4.13.1.5. Hazardous cargo is aboard.
   4.13.2. Make a 30-minute prior-to-arrival radio call to the destination base to include:
      4.13.2.1. Line numbers (if base is under U.S. control-or understands T.O. 11N-20-11).
      4.13.2.2. Location of the cargo.
      4.13.2.3. A statement that "negative hazardous cargo is aboard" when aircraft carries
      inert devices only.
      4.13.2.4. A description of the physical appearance and location in the aircraft of inert
      devices when mixed loads of hazardous material and inert devices are aboard.
   4.13.3. If an emergency requires an immediate landing and the Aircraft Commander must
   choose between communication security and flight safety, then safety will take precedence.
   Classified information may be disclosed only to the extent necessary for safety of flight.
   4.13.4. Jettisoning Nuclear Cargo. The Loadmaster will identify which cargo is and is not
   jettisonable. In an emergency, the Aircraft Commander bears obligation to jettison cargo or
   crash-land where the least amount of damage will result. Activate CDS if applicable before
   jettisoning or crash landing. Record coordinates of each jettisoned item. Observe jettison
   restrictions in the SWOG.
   4.13.5. Lightning Strikes. Any time an aircraft transporting nuclear cargo is struck by
   lightning or has a significant static discharge that could affect the nuclear cargo or
   components, inspect cargo and take the following actions:
      4.13.5.1. If there are signs of damage, land as soon as possible where a USAF EOD team
      is available that can provide initial evaluation of the weapons condition. Isolate aircraft
      with cargo aboard and request USAF EOD support. If USAF EOD support is not
      available then request support from the nearest Service EOD team that can provide initial
      evaluation of the weapons condition. Initiate official request for USAF EOD support to
      the weapons custodial installation for USAF EOD support.
      4.13.5.2. If there are no signs of damage continue the flight to the scheduled destination
      and have the weapons inspected by USAF EOD team and nuclear weapons personnel as
      soon as possible.
      4.13.5.3. File an accident, incident, or deficiency (AID) report IAW AFMAN 91-221,
      Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports.
4.14. Border Clearance Procedures.
 42                                                                 AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


      4.14.1. Purpose. To give aircrews border clearance procedures when carrying nuclear cargo
      or warheads, LLCs, and classified nuclear support materiel.
      4.14.2. Policy and Procedures.     Border clearance is the responsibility of the Aircraft
      Commander.
         4.14.2.1. Use general border clearance procedures in AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 3.
         4.14.2.2. Prepare cargo manifests (DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest) for customs officials
         on all cargo. The shipper will supply manifests for unclassified non-nuclear cargo.
         Loadmasters will prepare manifests for nuclear cargo and other classified cargo. List this
         cargo as classified ordnance, classified electronics equipment, classified test equipment,
         or similar wording which best describes it. Descriptions must not associate cargo with
         nuclear material. These manifests must include number of units, weight, and cubic
         displacement in feet.
         4.14.2.3. Waivers of Customs and Quarantine Boarding. A letter will be prepared and
         reproduced in the format depicted in Attachment 4.2. with appropriate organizational
         letterhead.
      4.14.3. The Aircraft Commander will tactfully request US customs and agriculture
      quarantine inspectors accept a waiver for boarding and examination of aircraft because of the
      classified cargo aboard.
         4.14.3.1. If the waiver is denied and the aircraft is at an en route location, the Aircraft
         Commander will request a “permit to proceed” to the final destination.
         4.14.3.2. If the waiver or “permit to proceed” is denied, the inspectors will comply with
         entry control guidance IAW DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108 and be escorted using a
         TPC team. Ensure that all serial numbers, as a minimum, are covered before letting the
         inspectors board to get a full customs and quarantine clearance. If possible, cover all
         weapons completely.
      4.14.4. Do not allow foreign customs or other local government officials in the aircraft. If
      they insist on boarding, refuse entry in the most diplomatic, but positive manner. Contact the
      base commander if on a US military base or the air attaché if on a non-US base and ask for
      help. In all cases, notify CCC as soon as possible.
      4.14.5. When filing a flight plan into a base that does not have customs or agriculture
      quarantine inspectors readily available, request customs and/or agriculture inspectors meet
      the aircraft by contacting the arrival base command post/AMCC. Determine hours of
      operations of customs facilities and comply with any requirements for advance notification.
      In a divert situation, give as much lead-time as possible to arrange for customs and
      agriculture inspectors.
4.15. Crew Rest Procedures. Before entering crew rest at an en route station, the Aircraft
Commander will ensure the aircraft is sealed (as required) and a sequence of events is distributed
to appropriate support agencies for follow-on operations. Provide command post and 618 AOC
(TACC) contact information during crew rest in the case of an emergency.
4.16. Itinerary Deviation.
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                      43


  4.16.1. As soon as it is apparent a mission will deviate from published itinerary, notify the
  appropriate CCC of ETA for remaining en route stations on that day's itinerary. CCC will
  immediately notify destination points of contact and appropriate diplomatic clearance
  authorities by telephone. Passing timely and accurate information to destination is extremely
  important.
  4.16.2. If a mission deviates by two or more hours from last published itinerary, the CCC
  will coordinate with the Aircraft Commander and XOOOD to send a mission change
  message (Attachment 3). Points of contact at bases scheduled to be transited, the pre-
  coordinated emergency divert location, and tanker unit (if applicable), and appropriate en
  route agencies will also be advised by secure means of new times. Do not launch until CCC
  has determined subsequent stations for that day can accept the mission in accordance with the
  revised plan. If the aircrew coordinates directly with the shipper or receiver, advise CCC.
  4.16.3. Mission Change Message:
     4.16.3.1. The mission planning section will coordinate mission change message with the
     Aircraft Commander. Attempt to return mission to its original itinerary by adjusting
     ground times if possible. Do not sacrifice proper crew rest to return to the original
     schedule; however, do not perpetuate small delays by using originally planned ground
     times if less time will provide adequate crew rest.
     4.16.3.2. The Aircraft Commander will relay revised information to CCC. CCC is
     responsible for checking times for conflicts with other missions, notifying the pre-
     coordinated divert location, tanker unit (if applicable), appropriate en route agencies, and
     remaining bases. The mission planning section will draft and send any message traffic
     required. Take care to ensure classified information is not compromised.
     4.16.3.3. Use Attachment 3, format, and classify the mission change message the same
     as original Setup Message or in accordance with the SWOG. Include hazardous cargo
     information if changed from the Setup Message. Changes to overflight information
     messages required by the SWOG will normally be made as directed in the SWOG or
     Letters-of-Agreement (LOA).
     4.16.3.4. Include all addressees in the Mission Setup Message including the aircrew’s
     current location, divert locations, and remaining bases. Omit stations already transited.
  4.16.4. Unscheduled Hot RON. Mission delays may force the aircrew into an unscheduled
  Hot RON. If it becomes apparent to an Aircraft Commander the crew will not be able to
  proceed to the next destination and complete the offload within remaining CDT, he or she
  will immediately contact AMC CCC and request authority for either:
     4.16.4.1. An extension to crew duty day.
     4.16.4.2. Permission to offload cargo and attempt the mission at a later time.
     4.16.4.3. Permission to Hot RON at current location, emergency divert location, or
     destination airfield. Do not proceed to destination if the mission will arrive without
     sufficient time to complete offload (if one is planned) unless destination base has
     confirmed through CCC they can support the Hot RON.               At USAFE bases,
     USAFE/A3/10 approval is required for a Hot RON. CCC will coordinate Hot RON
     requests through USAFE/A3/10NM.
 44                                                                   AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


                                              Chapter 5

                                             SECURITY

5.1. General. Security standards for nuclear cargo, aircraft sanitization, EALs, and emergency
security actions are listed in DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108.
5.2. Threat and Vulnerability. When nuclear cargo is outside secure storage areas, they are
susceptible to accidental damage and to terrorist attack. Take every action to reduce the time
nuclear cargo spends outside a secure storage area.
5.3. Types of Security. The degree of security protection will vary according to the cargo.
DoD security requirements are broken into two categories, Type I security and Type II security.
Refer to DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108 for a full description of Type I and Type II
security. Note: When discussing security requirements with another service, a detailed
description may be necessary.
5.4. Protection Standards. Nuclear cargo requires Type I security. Aircrew will ensure
security meets DoD and Air Force standards when transporting nuclear cargo.
5.5. Type I Exclusion Area Procedures. Entry into an area containing nuclear cargo must be
controlled. Specific aircrew procedures for exclusion area around aircraft are:
      5.5.1. Type I Entry Control and Authority. All personnel requiring entry into the exclusion
      area will be on an EAL IAW DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108. EALs will list only the
      minimum number of personnel necessary for the mission, enhancing the control and access to
      the area. The Courier will ensure all EALs are retrieved from the entry controller prior to
      aircraft departure.
      5.5.2. Personnel and vehicles requesting entry into the exclusion area will be processed prior
      to aircraft arrival and will be placed into a sanitized secure holding area. This will allow for
      the Courier to validate the personnel and equipment after landing and streamline ground
      times.
      5.5.3. Every effort should be made to streamline operations but not at the cost of surety.
      Emphasis is on safety, surety, efficient ground times, and minimal exposure of nuclear cargo.
      5.5.4. Convoy Arrival at Aircraft. Aircrew will be ready to start loading as soon as the
      convoy arrives. Ensure area is large enough to accommodate safe maneuvering of nuclear
      cargo carrying vehicles.
      5.5.5. The exclusion area will be IAW DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108, Vol 3,
      Enclosure 9. Do not raise, lower, or change any part of the area without coordination and
      approval of both the Courier officer and host security forces.
      5.5.6. Contraband is defined in DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108. PNAF aircrews
      transporting nuclear cargo are authorized government issued and personal cell phones,
      computers, other electronics devices, and other general cargo. Aircrew should minimize the
      number of devices used to accomplish the mission and will comply with AFMAN 91-201 or
      specific Nuclear Certification Impact Statement requirements. The aircrew Courier remains
      the ultimate authority for all equipment allowed to be in the exclusion area. Government and
      personal electronic devices must meet the following conditions:
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                       45


       5.5.6.1. Government issued cell phones, computers, and other electronic devices
       assigned to C-17 aircrew are authorized to be used aboard the aircraft if the systems
       perform a unique, mission-essential function. However, if a system performs a backup or
       redundant function, it will not be used unless the primary system(s) are not functioning.
       If not required for mission execution as previously stated, the equipment will be turned
       off, battery removed (if possible), and remain stowed on the aircraft when nuclear cargo
       is aboard.
       5.5.6.2. Personal cell phones, computers, and other electronic devices carried by C-17
       aircrew are authorized to be used aboard the aircraft if the government issued electronic
       equipment is not functioning. If not required for mission execution as previously stated,
       the equipment will be turned off, battery removed (if possible), and remain stowed on the
       aircraft when nuclear cargo is aboard. If the battery cannot be removed, the item will be
       placed in an approved Radio Frequency Shielded Bag and stowed.
5.6. Sanitized Aircraft. Sanitize aircraft before carrying nuclear cargo. Sanitization is a
thorough check for unauthorized explosives or stowaways and should be done at the most logical
station, normally at the first onload location. It can also be accomplished at an en route station
when several stops are made before onloading nuclear cargo. When approved by the Aircraft
Commander and Courier officer and coordinated with host base, Type II security may be
dropped for an empty aircraft during RON. Aircraft will be provided random checks by security
forces as a PL3 resource. Before loading nuclear cargo, aircraft will be sanitized, a restricted
area re-established, and Type I security provided.
   5.6.1. Sanitization Procedures. Aircrews will conduct a thorough visual inspection and
   appropriate aircraft dash-1 preflight or through-flight inspection to search for explosives,
   suspicious devices or packages, or unauthorized persons. When available, an explosive
   detection dog (EDD) or portable explosive detection devices will be used to sanitize the
   aircraft and crew baggage. Do not delay the mission if an EDD is not available. If a
   suspicious device or explosives are found during the aircrew search, cordon off the area and
   request support from the nearest military EOD unit. During periods of inclement weather,
   crew bags may be sanitized inside the aircraft.
   5.6.2. If an aircraft is changed during the mission the new aircraft must be sanitized.
   5.6.3. Providing Type II security on a sanitized aircraft maintains the sanitization, and
   precludes the need to re-sanitize before loading nuclear cargo. Note: Consider removing
   Type II security if extended servicing or maintenance is required. Resanitize before
   onloading nuclear cargo if Type II requirements are removed.
       5.6.3.1. The aircraft will be sealed.
       5.6.3.2. Type II security will be maintained (not required if aircraft is parked in a
       designated "PL1" restricted area, e.g., an AFGSC alert area).
       5.6.3.3. Only the aircrew (not including the crew chief) are authorized unescorted access
       to the aircraft.
       5.6.3.4. Security personnel are informed that Type II security material is aboard. Note:
       Do not request security support merely to guard the PNAF Aircrew Nuclear Mission Kit.
 46                                                                  AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


5.7. Emergency Diverts of Nuclear-Laden Aircraft. CONUS and OCONUS bases should
handle emergency diverts using support plan (SPLAN) procedures for receiving nuclear-laden
aircraft. The pre-coordinated emergency divert location will maintain standby forces to receive
nuclear-laden aircraft IAW an SPLAN that complies with current DoD and Air Force guidance.
5.8. Sealing Aircraft. Normally, seal nuclear mission aircraft during crew rests and extended
en route delays. During RONs at normal AMC maintenance airfields, sealing is at the discretion
of the Aircraft Commander. If sealing for security purposes, have a security force representative
verify seals during sealing and opening the aircraft. If sealing for maintenance or non-security
purposes, make every effort to comply with host base security procedures, but as a minimum
have two aircrew members verify all seals and record the seal number. Each time aircrew or
other authorized persons enter the aircraft, the aircraft will be resealed by aircrew or other
authorized persons when they depart.
      5.8.1. Tape emergency escape hatches, paratroop doors, maintenance/ditching hatches, etc.,
      on the interior to show evidence of forced or unauthorized entry. The crew entrance door(s)
      and any under floor access will be closed and sealed by a serialized security seal.
      5.8.2. After the crew door has been sealed, wipe the area clean around the seal and provide
      the seal number to security forces and command post, as required.
      5.8.3. Upon return, verify the seal number and inspect seals inside the aircraft according to
      DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108.
      5.8.4. In the event of forced entry or evidence that seals on aircraft have been tampered with:
         5.8.4.1. Ensure all evidence remains untouched.
         5.8.4.2. When the aircraft is empty, report the incident to base command post who will
         notify security forces, EOD, and the Office of Special Investigations (OSI). Request an
         immediate investigation.
         5.8.4.3. When nuclear cargo is aboard report the incident to base command post who will
         notify security forces, EOD, and the Office of Special Investigations (OSI). Assume the
         weapon has been tampered with and follow procedures outlined in DoD 3150.8-M,
         Nuclear Weapon Accident Response Procedures (NARP), DoDI 3150.10, DoD Response
         to U.S. Nuclear Weapon Incidents, and AFI 10-2518, Nuclear Weapons Accident and
         Incident Response. Request an immediate investigation.
         5.8.4.4. After investigation is complete and aircraft is released by EOD and security
         forces, perform a thorough preflight and send appropriate reports IAW AFMAN 91-221.
5.9. Security Acknowledgment Letter. Security acknowledgment letters are a means of
transferring security responsibility to host base security forces. Couriers may use the letter in
Attachment 4.4. after determining security requirements while the crew is not at the aircraft.
5.10. Security Briefing Worksheet. The Courier will use the security briefing worksheet (AF
Form 527A) to coordinate security details with the host base security forces. Host base SF will
coordinate with host base AFOSI (if applicable) to provide the requested information and the
local threat assessment for events that might impact the mission. Place a Date Time Group
(DTG) on the briefings, and send to each other via secure means. Follow up with a secure voice
phone call to the host base to work out any details if required. All coordination will be
completed NLT two duty days prior to mission departure from home station IAW AFI 21-203.

                          CUSTODY TRANSFER PROCEDURES

6.1. General. This Chapter expands on Courier requirements and nuclear cargo custody
procedures in T.O. 11N-45-51. The Courier is final authority for cargo security, except during
airborne emergencies when the Aircraft Commander rules that safety-of-flight is paramount.
The Courier retains the ultimate authority to accept or deny nuclear cargo.
6.2. Courier Designation and Certification.
   6.2.1. All PNAF Aircraft Commanders must be Courier-qualified.
   6.2.2. Requirements for being a Courier are in T.O. 11N-45-51.
   6.2.3. Identify Couriers to shippers in writing. Identification will include the Courier's
   name, rank, and security clearance. Normally, this identification is in the Mission Setup
   Message; however, it may be a separate message sent by 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD via
   email after they validate the information. This may occur when Couriers are replaced during
   mission execution. Verify the Courier’s identification by using the Common Access Card
   (CAC). Note: "Identification of an Official Courier Letter" (Attachment 4.1.) is for use
   during border clearance and does not satisfy any of the above requirements.
6.3. Persons Authorized to Sign for Nuclear and DoD Nuclear-related Cargo.
   6.3.1. Each organization that ships or receives nuclear material is required to publish a list of
   those persons authorized to sign for cargo according to T.O. 11N-45-51 and AFI 21-203.
   The Courier will have the appropriate Certification of Personnel to Receipt for Classified
   Material NLT ten days prior to home station departure. If letter changes are required while
   the mission is en route, the organization making the change will fax or email the corrected
   copy to 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD who will in turn forward to the Courier. Couriers will
   only release nuclear and nuclear-related cargo to authorized persons.
   6.3.2. Identify shipper/receivers by cross-referencing data IAW T.O. 11N-45-51.
6.4. Courier Responsibilities. The Courier is responsible for receipt, custody, security, safety,
and delivery of nuclear and nuclear-related cargo to authorized receivers. Specific Courier
responsibilities include:
   6.4.1. Have written instructions that specify nuclear and nuclear-related cargo to be shipped
   (Mission Setup Message and Airlift Request).
   6.4.2. Have a list of authorized receivers.
   6.4.3. Receive the shipper's briefing.
       6.4.3.1. The Courier will use the AF Form 527B for briefing requirements. The shipper
       may use the example brief provided in AF Form 527C or a locally developed brief
       provided all briefing requirements IAW 11N-45-51 are met. Prior to the aircraft’s
       departure from home station, the Courier and shipper will complete the written briefings,
       place a DTG on them, and send it to each other via secure means. If needed, the Courier
       will contact the shipper via email or phone to clarify details. All coordination will be
       completed NLT two duty days prior to home station departure.
48                                                              AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


     6.4.3.2. The Courier and shipper will confirm the DTGs of the briefings and only brief
     applicable changes. Any questions about forms or cargo will be resolved before
     accepting cargo.
     6.4.3.3. When cargo is equipped with a CDS, ensure that the Courier and one additional
     crewmember are knowledgeable of performing CDS procedures. If anyone requests a
     briefing on CDS procedures, the shipper will brief as described in T.O. 11N-45-51,
     section 5 prior to departing. The shipper will provide CDS codes to the Courier as soon
     as the Courier signs the DD Form 1911. The CDS codes and at least one individual
     knowledgeable in CDS procedures will remain on the aircraft when ropes and stanchions
     are removed prior to departure and until Type I security is established after arrival. The
     Courier will verify that CDS has not been activated on weapons that do not have sealed
     command disable panels. Do not accept a CDS-equipped weapon without CDS codes
     unless all of the following exist: the Setup Message/Airlift Request indicated shipment
     of a disabled weapon, the disablement indicator (pin) is verified, and the weapon is
     documented on the DD Form 1911 remarks section as being disabled and without CDS
     codes.
     6.4.3.4. If the Aircraft Commander and primary mission Loadmaster were not present for
     the shipper and Courier briefing, the Courier will brief them on hazards or nature and
     special handling instructions before loading.
 6.4.4. Before accepting and loading nuclear and nuclear-related cargo, the Courier, shipper,
 and primary Loadmaster will inspect cargo. Delay removing nuclear weapon covers until
 just before inspecting/loading. Covers (if applicable) must be removed prior to loading due
 to safety concerns during loading and offloading operations.
     6.4.4.1. Inspect cargo for general conditions. Check the following as applicable:
     weapon(s) securely attached to bolster; pressure relief valves; tie-down and winching
     attachments; number and integrity of seals; condition of bolster tires/wheels; and
     condition of casters, wheels, and carrier brakes. Deficiencies affecting safety must be
     corrected before accepting cargo.
     6.4.4.2. Document minor damage, e.g. scratches, scrapes, small dents, etc., in the
     remarks section of the DD Form 1911. Have the shipper initial entry.
     6.4.4.3. Inspect all containers to verify condition of seals. Request the shipper replace
     any broken or missing seals. Have the shipper verify the condition of the seals for
     palletized LLCs. If broken or missing seals cannot be replaced and the integrity of the
     container is suspect, reject the container. If the container is accepted with broken or
     missing seals and the integrity is not suspect, annotate the exact condition on DD Form
     1911.
     6.4.4.4. Nuclear and nuclear-related cargo presented for shipment must be exactly as
     described by the Mission Setup Message and Airlift Request. If nuclear cargo differs
     from the Mission Setup Message and Airlift Request, follow procedures IAW paragraph
     2.7.3. Serial numbers must also agree with those listed on DD Form 1911 and the cargo
     diplomatic clearance approval message, if required.
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                       49


   6.4.5. Accept custody of nuclear cargo by signing DD Form 1911 and release custody only
   on signature of positively identified authorized receivers or a replacement Courier. Do not
   sign for cargo that the Courier cannot maintain custody of and/or inspect.
   6.4.6. The Courier is responsible for enforcing TPC.
6.5. Documentation. Shippers are required to provide properly completed DD Forms 1911.
Instructions for the forms are in T.O. 11N-45-51. On mission termination at home station, return
completed DD Forms 1911 to the squadron/unit. DD Forms 1387, Military Shipment Label, are
required on LLCs by T.O. 11N-45-51. DD Form 1387-2, Special Handling Data/Certification,
is required on all hazardous cargo not identifiable by a T.O. 11N-20-11 line number.
6.6. Replacement Courier.
   6.6.1. If the Courier must be replaced while a mission is in progress, custody must be
   transferred to either a replacement Courier or a qualified Courier on the crew. The rest of the
   stations to be transited must be notified of the Courier change by message from the
   appropriate CCC or parent wing if the Courier was not previously included in the Mission
   Setup Message.
   6.6.2. If a replacement Courier is not available, Courier duties may be assumed in the
   following order of precedence:
       6.6.2.1. Courier Qualified Extra Pilot. In this case, the mission may proceed to where a
       replacement Courier is available or complete the mission if the additional pilot workload
       will not detract from Courier duties.
       6.6.2.2. Aircraft Commander. As a last resort, use the Aircraft Commander as the
       Courier when it is more important from a security standpoint to move the mission than to
       wait for a replacement Courier. The primary consideration is always cargo security.
   6.6.3. In an aircraft mishap, when the Courier and/or another Courier-qualified crewmember
   cannot perform duties, the highest ranking surviving crewmember will automatically assume
   Courier duties.

                                             Chapter 7

                           NUCLEAR AIRLIFT MISSION SUPPORT

7.1. General. Nuclear airlift missions are one of the most important missions in the airlift
system. Airlift priority of Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) given to special weapons missions is 1A3
(CJCSI 4120.02C, Assignment of Movement and Mobility Priority), which is preceded only by
presidential support, presidential-approved, and combat troop support missions. Priorities are
used to fill Airlift Requests. All mobility agencies will support the missions according to the
JCS priority. Support will involve all aspects of the mission, to include security, EOD,
maintenance, fuel, aircrew transport, and billeting. Bases that belong to other MAJCOMs or
services fall under AFJI 11-204. It requires base commanders to establish a written plan or
directive to ensure priority support.
7.2. Nuclear Airlift Support. Bases with an operational PNAF wing and those that support
PNAF missions will have a written plan or instruction to support these missions. In addition,
plans at bases that regularly receive requirements to support loaded PNAF aircraft will also
comply with AFJI 11-204. Note: Chapter 4 and the SWOG contain additional information on
emergency divert locations.
7.3. Responsibilities.
      7.3.1. Bases requiring a written instruction or plan to support nuclear missions will ensure
      the following is specified:
         7.3.1.1. A single focal point to handle information on the mission.
         7.3.1.2. The base communications procedures to notify the appropriate agencies of an
         inbound aircraft. Bases must be able to respond to a short-notice emergency divert.
         7.3.1.3. Taxi routes and parking spots.
         7.3.1.4. Security force procedures (equipment, response times, etc.).
         7.3.1.5. Priority maintenance and aerial port support.
         7.3.1.6. Priority crew transportation, billeting, and messing.
         7.3.1.7. Fire-fighting support requirements in T.O. 11N-20-11.
         7.3.1.8. EOD capability and responsibilities (notification procedures, response, and
         equipment requirements).
         7.3.1.9. Emergency Management procedures, defined in the Installation Emergency
         Management Plan (IEMP) 10-2.
   7.3.2. The installation commander or OSC will be present for shipments and receipts of
   nuclear cargo to personally ensure priority support.
   7.3.3. In addition to the support plan, installation commanders will ensure all support
   requirements are coordinated with appropriate base support agencies.
   7.3.4. Commanders of USAFE units in tenant status will arrange priority support with their
   hosts.
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                        51


7.4. Command and Control. Nuclear airlift missions place demands on the command and
control system over and above normal operations. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD planners will
ensure a "Y" is in the CLOSE WATCH block. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG will monitor the status
of each mission. Additionally, missions carrying nuclear cargo will be continuously tracked
during execution. Specific responsibilities are:
   7.4.1. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD will maintain ready access to the SWOG and the DoD
   FCG, understand overflight procedures and restrictions, and in coordination with tanker
   planning section, coordinate tanker support, and obtain ALTRV approvals. Flight planning
   branch will validate computer flight plans (CFP) for compliance with the SWOG and DoD
   FCG restrictions, EURO Control Route Availability Document (RAD), ALTRV routings,
   and avoid heavily populated areas then transmit to the current C2 system. Mission planning
   section confirms diplomatic clearances and ensures alternates on CFPs are capable of
   supporting PNAF missions.
   7.4.2. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG will assist PNAF Aircraft Commanders in determining the
   best divert location for a nuclear mission. In accordance with the Mission Setup Message
   and this instruction, notify the selected divert location of all required support needed to meet
   the aircraft when it lands. When the Aircraft Commander informs 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG
   that he or she has selected a different divert location from the one pre-coordinated via the
   Mission Setup Message, the duty controller must then coordinate with the new divert location
   and advise the pre-coordinated divert location it is no longer under consideration as a divert
   option. When time permits, use guidance for mission change message in paragraph 2.6.
   7.4.3. AMC/A7S and 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG will actively monitor security status of
   bases that nuclear airlift missions are scheduled to transit. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD will
   be prepared to confirm each day's itinerary with Aircraft Commanders when they check in.
   Mission Setup Message will request a support confirmation message be sent from each base
   on the itinerary to appropriate CCC 24-hours before arrival at each base. Use this message to
   confirm security before allowing aircraft to proceed. Only attempt contact with the
   destination base to confirm support via non-secure means if the 24-Hour confirmation of
   support message has not been received.
   7.4.4. Mission planning section will prepare and send mission change messages IAW
   paragraphs 2.6 and/or 4.16.3 after coordination with the Aircraft Commander. Check for
   conflicts with other nuclear missions and include hazardous cargo information if load is
   changed.
   7.4.5. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD will act as the point of contact between shippers or
   receivers and aircrew during the mission. Pass updates to down line bases as requested by
   the Aircraft Commander.
   7.4.6. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG will ensure nuclear airlift missions delayed for maintenance
   problems get immediate and priority support.
   7.4.7. AMC Command Center will prepare and submit Operational Report 3 (OPREP-3)
   covering nuclear mission incidents according to paragraph 10.1 and JCS Pub 6.
7.5. Intelligence Support. Intelligence support is an essential element of the PNAF mission. It
requires constant attention and adherence to procedures to successfully ensure PNAF safety and
 52                                                                 AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


security. To ensure PNAF missions and aircrews receive timely intelligence threat information,
these procedures will be followed.
      7.5.1. Home Station OSS/IN will:
         7.5.1.1. Monitor planned PNAF missions for pre-mission intelligence briefing
         requirements and remain aware of off-station missions that could require en route
         Intelligence support.
         7.5.1.2. Provide pre-mission intelligence briefings to PNAF aircrews IAW AFI 14-2C-17
         Vol 3, C-17 Unit Intelligence Procedures.
            7.5.1.2.1. Intelligence pre-mission briefings will be IAW AFI 14-2C-17 Vol 3, and
            must include the following:
            7.5.1.2.2. Airborne and surface threats from potential hostile countries.
            7.5.1.2.3. Terrorist and sabotage threats.
            7.5.1.2.4. Other activity along route that might impact mission.
            7.5.1.2.5. All source Foreign intelligence collection and criminal threats.
         7.5.1.3. Debrief PNAF aircrews on their return as required and report mission results
         IAW the Mobility Intelligence Reporting Directive (MIRD).
   7.5.2. AMC/A2 will provide support IAW AFI 14-2C-17 Vol 3 and DoD S-5210.41-
   M_AFMAN 31-108. AMC/A2 will:

                                           Chapter 8

                                   LOGISTICS SUPPORT

8.1. General. This guidance outlines maintenance procedures for aircraft used to carry nuclear
cargo. It applies to all maintenance and operations personnel who support or conduct nuclear
airlift missions.
8.2. Aircraft Selection and Preparation. Nuclear airlift missions are assigned JCS priority
1A3. Aircraft selected to fly these missions must not have any uncorrected history of repeat or
recurring malfunctions on systems identified as mission capable IAW the Minimum Essential
Subsystem Listing (MESL) Home Station Departure (HSD) Air Refueling Conventional (ARC)
and be the most reliable aircraft for PNAF. Mission aircraft selected for a PNAF mission must
meet the stringent criteria in this paragraph. The criteria are essential to preclude potential
mission delays while the aircraft is in the mobility system. Missions are extensively coordinated
and delay has a serious effect on nuclear surety.
   8.2.1. Maintenance Operations Officer/Superintendent has the overall responsibility for
   aircraft selection, PNAF maintenance team selection, and aircraft preparation and will:
       8.2.1.1. Select PNAF maintenance teams from highly experienced technicians who are
       motivated and qualified in their career field for their specific aircraft.
       8.2.1.2. Coordinate with MOS Plans, Scheduling and Documentation Section                to
       schedule aircraft for PNAF missions.
       8.2.1.3. Oversee aircraft selection process.
       8.2.1.4. Select a Senior Maintenance Representative (SMR) highly experienced on the C-
       17 to oversee and execute all aircraft preparation functions. The SMR must be an
       appropriately qualified maintenance officer, senior NCO, or civilian equivalent IAW AFI
       21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, as supplemented.
       8.2.1.5. The operating wing may use an automated product (e.g. Excel Spreadsheet or
       Access Database) to maintain oversight of the aircraft preparation events, manage aircraft
       maintenance preparation actions, and provide leadership with preparation status. If used,
       the automated product will be approved by the wing NSM.
   8.2.2. Aircraft Selection: Select the safest, most reliable aircraft available for PNAF
   missions. Aircraft will be selected by the unit not later than 48-hours before aircraft
   departure to accomplish inspections, servicing, maintenance, cleaning, and configuration.
   Select aircraft for PNAF missions based on the following:
       8.2.2.1. Do not select aircraft that have a history of uncorrected repeat or recurring
       system malfunctions on any system identified in the aircraft MESL/ARC. All aircraft
       systems that will be used during PNAF missions must be classified mission capable in
       accordance with aircraft MESL for HSD/ARC. PNAF aircraft will not have any
       restrictions on systems and subsystems identified in the MESL for HSD/ARC that will be
       used during PNAF missions.
       8.2.2.2. Aircraft will be equipped with equipment to enable continuous tracking by
       Command and Control agencies.
54                                                                   AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


        8.2.2.3. If a time change item is projected to come due during a PNAF Mission, replace
        it before departure. Aircraft engine time changes may be exceeded by 10 percent or 100
        hours, whichever is greater, as prescribed in T.O. 2-1-18, Aircraft Engine Operating
        Limits and Factors Operating Limits and Pipeline Times.
        8.2.2.4. All urgent action or interim routine safety time compliance technical orders
        (TCTOs) or one-time inspections will be accomplished before departure according to
        T.O. 00-5-15, Air Force TCTO System.
        8.2.2.5. Tires with cuts deeper than 1/2 of the embossed tire cut limit, cuts which exceed
        4/32inch deeper than the wear mark and tread groove without an embossed cut limit, or
        cuts of more than 1/2-inch in length will be replaced before PNAF missions. All cuts
        will be measured from the bottom of the nearest groove at the immediate vicinity of the
        cut. If a cut extends into the cord body, the tire will be replaced as prescribed In T.O. 4T-
        1-3, Inspection, Maintenance Instructions, Storage, And Disposition Of Aircraft Tires
        And Inner Tubes.
        8.2.2.6. Aircraft selected will not have fuel leaks or seepage limits greater than 1/2 of the
        allowable limit in T.O. 1-1-3, Inspection and Repair of Aircraft Integral Tanks, and Fuel
        Cells.
        8.2.2.7. Aircraft selected will not have hydraulic or oil leakage limits greater than 1/2 of
        the allowable limits in mission design series (MDS) specific technical orders.
        8.2.2.8. Consider all available safety and structural enhancements when selecting an
        aircraft.
        8.2.2.9. If an aircraft has evidence of a fuel tank fire, the aircraft will not be scheduled
        for or continue on a PNAF mission.
        8.2.2.10. AFTO Form 781, Arms Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document series forms
        must be reviewed to ensure no discrepancy exists that would keep aircraft from being
        used on a nuclear airlift mission, e.g. discrepancies with winch, tie-down equipment,
        rails, etc.
     8.2.3. The PNAF SMR will:
        8.2.3.1. Ensure aircraft are prepared for PNAF missions.
        8.2.3.2. Review and validate accuracy of aircraft documentation (e.g., aircraft forms,
        CAMS/GO81 histories, time change items, special inspections, scheduled/unscheduled
        delayed discrepancies, outstanding time compliance technical orders, and engine data
        trend analysis). Note: Ensure aircraft documentation is cleared correctly IAW T.O. 00-
        20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies and
        Procedures, and the MAJCOM supplement.
        8.2.3.3. Check CAMS/GO81 aircraft histories for completed repeat/recurring
        maintenance actions and required operational checks. Re-verify repeat/recurring
        discrepancies with questionable, incomplete actions or operational checks.
        8.2.3.4. Ensure PNAF aircraft has a current preflight inspection.

   8.3.3. Fuel servicing guidance for explosive loaded aircraft is contained in T.O. 00-25-172,
   Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding. For each mission leg, the
   aircraft shall be refueled before being loaded with nuclear material to reduce the severity of a
   mishap. Cargo aircraft loaded with transportation-configured explosives may be refueled at
   aircraft explosive cargo parking areas, commonly called hot cargo pads. If fuel servicing is
   necessary with nuclear cargo aboard, ensure firefighting support requirements (fire
   extinguishers, Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting vehicle, etc.) are available and positioned IAW
   AFI 91-115 and T.O. 11N-20-11.

   maintenance, and Aircraft Commander is required at all times, especially when PNAF
   aircraft has a maintenance problem.
   8.4.2. Safety and security of nuclear cargo must be considered at all times when coordinating
   maintenance support. The Aircraft Commander's decision is final.
   8.4.3. Use weapon system MESL to determine status of PNAF aircraft. A Maintenance
   Operations Control (MOC) senior controller will personally monitor maintenance support for
   PNAF missions while on their station.
   8.4.4. Maintenance support of nuclear airlift missions will take precedence over missions
   with lesser priorities.
   8.4.5. When a replacement aircraft is required en route, every effort must be made to select
   an aircraft to meet the criteria in paragraph 8.2.
      8.4.5.1. The aircraft may be selected from the nearest location consistent with mission
      requirements.
      8.4.5.2. Spare aircraft selected from other locations will only be selected after
      coordination with 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG.

                                               Chapter 9

                                POST MISSION REQUIREMENTS

9.1. General. This Chapter describes procedures for reporting and solving problems
encountered on nuclear airlift missions and for identifying outstanding host base support to
nuclear airlift missions.
9.2. Special Assignment Airlift Mission Report (SAAMREP). This report is used to correct
deficiencies in equipment, procedures, or support. It is a way to monitor, evaluate, and
continually improve operational policies and procedures. The Aircraft Commander may submit
a report on a mission, or the squadron/unit nuclear airlift monitor may submit a report when
multiple missions encounter the same problem.
   9.2.1. Do not use the SAAMREP in place of other reports, e.g., hazard reports, DULL
   SWORD reports, material deficiency reports (MDR), or command operational reports, such
   as AMC Form 43, AMC Transient Aircrew Facilities Comment, or AMC Form 54, Aircraft
   Commander's Report on Services/Facilities.
      9.2.2. Prepare the SAAMREP in message format as illustrated in Attachment 5.1. Include
      enough details to identify deficiencies and clearly state problem areas. As a minimum,
      include names, organizations, date, time, and place. The report should be in sufficient detail
      to stand alone. Separate reports by problem area and location to assist in timely resolution.
      Include a statement in the report that the on-scene coordinator was informed of the problem.
      When a report results from multiple missions encountering the same problem, indicate who
      was contacted at the location about the problem.
      9.2.3. Classify the report (if necessary).
      9.2.4. Report Processing:
         9.2.4.1. The squadron/unit NAM will ensure reports are prepared in accordance with
         paragraph 9.2.2. Significant problems that are solved on the spot through aircrew
         involvement or at squadron/unit level may be submitted as reports “FOR
         DOCUMENTATION ONLY.”                In these cases, label the report “FOR
         DOCUMENTATION ONLY,” assign it a unit number, and file it with other
         SAAMREPs. Send a copy of the report to AMC/A3N to facilitate MAJCOM monitoring
         of the entire PNAF.
         9.2.4.2. The squadron/unit commander must endorse “FOR DOCUMENTATION
         ONLY” reports and reports up-channeled to the parent wing and MAJCOM. Information
         addressees on up-channeled reports are AMC/A3N, 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD,
         AMC/SEW, the parent wing NSM, SEW, and PNAF squadron/unit. The commander or
         operations officer of the base where the problem occurred must be an information
         addressee on report.
         9.2.4.3. The wing Nuclear Surety Manager reviews the report and determines Wing
         Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR).
         9.2.4.4. The squadron/unit NAM will send the report to AMC/A3N for action within 14
         days of mission completion. If AMC/A3N determines it is the appropriate level for
AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013                                                                         59


      problem resolution, they take responsibility from the initial report and notify subordinate
      levels.
   9.2.5. Each level acts on reported problems within 5 duty days from receipt. Include all
   previously addressed information addressees on correspondence related to the problem.
   9.2.6. Each agency, regardless of level, maintains a log or file of SAAMREPs showing the
   date received, the agency the report was sent to and date, and brief comments about its status.
   9.2.7. The final action agency sends response directly to AMC/A3N with all other levels as
   information addressees via message format as illustrated in Attachment 5.2. If AMC/A3N is
   the final action agency, send the response to the initiating squadron/unit, with all other levels
   as information addressees. AMC/A3N will forward the completed SAAMREP to
   AMC/SEW and 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD for review of recommended actions. AMC
   SEW will determine if the report should be forwarded to the AMC Nuclear Surety and
   Operations Council (NSOC) for command level oversight of recommended actions.
   9.2.8. The squadron/unit NAM debriefs the individual who submitted the report on the
   problem resolution.
   9.2.9. SAAMREPs are maintained for 2-years from the month of close-out.
   9.2.10. The preferred method of solving problems is for the Aircraft Commander to identify
   and solve them immediately with local personnel and the chain of command.
   9.2.11. The squadron/unit NAM keeps mission debrief records and "FOR
   DOCUMENTATION ONLY" reports on file so the unit can effectively show a recent
   problem was not an isolated incident and warrants a separate SAAMREP.
9.3. AF Form 527F, Checklist for Nuclear Mission Support. Send AF Form 527Fs to
AMC/SEW to recognize outstanding host base supports of nuclear airlift missions. AMC/SEW
awards the Annual Nuclear Surety Certificate of Appreciation.
   9.3.1. The Aircraft Commander or designated representative completes AF Form 527F
   covering each DoD installation that supports his or her aircraft while carrying nuclear and
   nuclear-related cargo.
   9.3.2. Do not use AF Form 527F in lieu of the SAAMREP or other reports to identify and
   solve problems.
   9.3.3. Classify AF Form 527F according to Mission Setup Message only if the base being
   rated is not on the numerical listing of bases published by AMC/A3N. When using the
   numerical designation for base location, be sure the narrative does not contain classified
   information.
   9.3.4. If possible, provide a copy of AF Form 576F to the on-scene coordinator. Do not
   include location or numerical listing on that copy.
   9.3.5. Squadron/unit NAM will provide copies of the AF Form 527F to AMC/SEW and
   A3N within 14 days of mission completion.
 60                                                               AFI13-526V1 14 JUNE 2013


                                          Chapter 10

                            REPORTING NUCLEAR MISHAPS

10.1. General. Aircrews are responsible for initiating mishap reports should a mishap occur
involving nuclear and nuclear-related cargo in their custody. Reportable events involving
nuclear cargo range from a condition that could degrade nuclear safety to the loss or destruction
of nuclear cargo. These events require a report IAW AFMAN 91-221 and are categorized as
nuclear accidents, incidents, or deficiencies (AID). Nuclear AIDs are identified with the flag
words which are covered in AFMAN 91-221. Refer to the SWOG for additional guidance for
overseas mishaps.
