SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction is updated to reflect procedure changes for the vault keys and locks control.
Suitability to Bear Firearms was added to inform commanders to be familiar and comply with
AFI-31-117 paragraph 2.3. An (*) indicates revisions from the previous edition.
1. Opening Procedures for Weapons Storage Area:
     1.1. All personnel entering the facility will sign AF Form 1109, Visitor Register Log.
        1.1.1. Annotate the Standard Form (SF) 702, Security Container Checklist, and open the
        two drawer safe in the building. The SF 702 is located on top of the safe.
        1.1.2. Open the weapons safe to acquire weapon for entry to the weapons vault.
        1.1.3. Remove the 9mm pistol from the drawer and verify the serial number of the
        weapon with the serial number on the AF Form 629, Small Arms Hand Receipt (located
        in the top safe drawer). Place the AF Form 629 in the slot where the 9 millimeter (mm)
        pistol was removed and place the 9mm pistol in your holster. Remove two clips of 9mm
        ammunition (15 rounds each) from the top drawer, place one in the reserve pouch on your
        pistol and the other into the weapon at the clearing barrel.
        1.1.4. Close the safe and annotate the SF 702. Ensure the safe is secured, have another
        individual double check the safe and sign SF 702 in the block annotated “Guard Check”.
     1.2. Weapons Arming Procedures:
        1.2.1. Ensure all personnel, except for yourself and a clearing barrel attendee, remain
        behind the red line. Proceed to the clearing barrel located on the west side wall of the
        building. With a clearing barrel attendee, place the muzzle on the 9mm in the clearing
        barrel. Pull back and lock the carriage slide to the rear. Ensure no obstruction is in the
        barrel prior to loading the magazine. Load the magazine and release the carriage slide
        forward. Place safe sector to the fire position and holster the weapon.
        1.2.2. Prior to entering the vault sign the SF 702 located on the vault door. It is crucial to
        the overall security of the weapons vault that the combination to the door not be
        compromised. After signing in, open the vault, enter the vault, secure the inner door
        behind you and deactivate the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The vault can now be
        opened for normal operations.
2. Authorizing Entrance to Weapons Custodian and Visitors to the Weapons Vault:
     2.1. Each squadron has a custodian appointment letter on file that must be used to properly
     verify access. Before allowing any individual to enter the vault, check their DD Form 2,
     Geneva Conventions Identification Card, with their social security number located on the
     weapons custodian’s appointment letter in the weapon books. After verification has been
     completed, have the individual sign in using AF Form 1109, Visitor Register Log, before
     entering the vault. Note: Some units and custodians visit on a constant basis, so personal
     recognition is authorized versus validating DD Form 2.
919SOWI31-101 18 APRIL 2013                                                                   3


   2.2. Once everyone enters the building, the armed guard will verify the door is secured
   before allowing physical entry to any individual into the vault storage area.
   2.3. Visitors can access their weapons stored in the vault when accompanied by an
   authorized individual. Verify visitor’s identification card and have the visitor sign in. The
   authorized individual will sign as the escort on the individual’s line. At no time will the
   visitor be left unattended in the vault without the authorized individual present. If the
   authorized individual has to leave the vault for any reason, he/she will secure all weapons
   and the visitor will exit the vault with the authorized individual.
3. Control of Keys and Locks:
   3.1. The AF Form 2432, Key Issue Log will be used for accountability of issued keys to the
   vault room.
   3.2. Keys to the weapon cages will be locked in the safe, the vault custodian will be
   responsible for opening the cages. Under no circumstances will the keys to the cages be
   given out.
   3.3. Before removing the seal have the individual verify the seal serial number that is
   annotated on the serial number roster hanging by the door. The roster shows the last person
   that secured the cage with date and time. After proper verification, the authorized vault
   manager will unlock the cage door.
   3.4. Weapons container and seal numbers affixed to containers storing ammunition or
   firearms will be recorded on the AF Form 1473, Gun Equipment Room Inventory and
   maintained inside the weapons vault. Each primary weapons custodian will maintain a list of
   their weapons containers and seal numbers. These numbers will be checked against numbers
   on AF 1473 located inside of the vault prior to all weapons inspections. When seals are
   changed the weapons custodians will update the AF Form 1473.
   3.5. Seals must be attached to the container in such a manner as to preclude surreptitious
   entry, i.e., removal of hinges or firearms.
   3.6. Only the designated unit weapon custodians are authorized to change seals.
   3.7. Each time a seal is changed, a complete inventory of the contents in the container is
   required. A new seal attached, and the number of the seal and the container annotated on the
   AF Form 1473. Primary weapons custodian, unit and container number will be displayed on
   each end of each weapon storage container.
   3.8. In the event an individual is removed from the access letter, a new letter must be re-
   accomplished and sent to 96 Security Force Squadron (SFS) Resource Protection within 72
   hours. After notification of removal the vault and safe combination will be changed
   immediately.
4. Ammunition Storage:
   4.1. 919 SFS resource protection ammunitions will be stored in a designated area, by type
   and lot number.
   4.2. When ammunition is stored in weapons magazines it will be inspected at least monthly
   for serviceability. The Senior Distribution Management Air Reserve Technician (ART) will
   turn defective ammunition into the 919th Maintenance Squadron/Munitions (MXS
 4                                                               919SOWI31-101 18 APRIL 2013


     /MXMVW). When weapons are issued a ten percent check will be conducted during each
     turn-in to validate accountability. Documentation supporting inspections and checks are

     resource protection ammunition. Any deviations will be coordinated with 919th SOW Safety
     (SE) and 919 MXS/MXMVW.
     5.8. The vault will be maintained in a neat and, orderly state, free from fire and safety
     hazards at all times.
     5.9. Ensure the entrance way is clear when opening the outer door for personnel
     entering/exiting the vault.
     5.10. The weapons clearing personnel will wear protective equipment (safety glasses) during
     loading and clearing operations. Additional requirements are contained in AFI 31-229.
     5.11. Munitions will not be handled roughly (rolled, tumbled, dropped, dragged, or thrown).

     6.1. When custodians and visitors complete their work in the vault, ensure the weapons
     racks/container are secured according to DoD Directive 5100.76 and the area is free of trash.

     their exit time on AF Form 1109.
     6.2. The armed guard will then close the inner cage door to allow the Intrusion Detection
     System (IDS) alarm motion sensors to activate. The required code is input to activate the
     IDS and the outer door is then secured, turn off vault light. Sign the SF702 after another
     individual verify the door is secure.
7. Unloading and Securing the 9mm Weapon:
     7.1. Ensure all personnel, except for yourself and clearing barrel attendant, remain behind
     the red line. With the clearing barrel attendant observing, remove your 9mm from the holster
     and place the muzzle in the clearing barrel. Place the firing selector on safe, remove the
     magazine, and hand it to the attendant. Pull back and lock the carriage slide to the rear.
     Check the chamber for any remaining rounds or obstruction, have attendee double check the
     chamber area and say “clear.” Once clear, slide carriage forward, secure weapon in holster
     until positioned in front of the safe. Once there remove the weapon from the holster and
