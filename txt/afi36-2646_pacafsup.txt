Force Corrections System requirement to attend a certification course.
A7.1.1. IAW AFI 31-205, confinement NCOs must complete one of the following courses

Personnel will be prompted to provide Name, rank, DOB, SSN (DEERS Confirmation) and
mailing address. Mailing address will be unit training manager’s (UTM) address. Since the final
exam must be proctored, all course material will be distributed through the UTM, Training NCO
or supervisor of the trainee and documented in member’s AFTR. Within 24 hrs of establishing a
profile, personnel will be able to access the MCI student dashboard of training courses.
A7.1.4. Once member has access to the MCI student dashboard, he/she will need to enroll into
