                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Basic Supervision Structure. A chain of supervision is vital to the safe and efficient
conduct of flight operations. In AFMC, this chain of supervision is structured around the
following positions:
   1.1.1. Operations Group Commander (OG). The OG is responsible for overall
   supervision of the organization's flying operations, and directs necessary actions to ensure
   compliance with the provisions of this instruction.
   1.1.2. Supervisor of Flying (SOF). When on duty, the SOF is the direct representative of
   the OG. In this capacity, the SOF provides real-time oversight of flying operations and is a
   primary source of assistance to aircrews. Decision authority is delegated to this position to
   accomplish the unit's mission.
   1.1.2. (EDWARDSAFB) Supervisor of Flying/Air Boss (SOF/A). SOF/A is the OG/CC
   representative in the control tower. The responsibilities of the SOF/A include real-time
   oversight of flying operations safety, assistance with midair collision avoidance in restricted
   area R-2515, and real-time airspace coordination/deconfliction assistance to aircrews. The
   position of SOF/A will be filled by rated aircrew members who will act as the Operations
   Group Commander’s representative for flying operations in R-2515, excluding Edwards
   Class D airspace.
   1.1.3. Squadron Supervisors. Squadron supervisors include the Squadron Commander
   (SQ/CC), the Operations Officer (SQ/DO), Assistant Operations Officer (ADO), and their
   designated representatives. They ensure compliance with the provisions of this instruction
   and the unit supplement.
   1.1.4. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Operations Duty Officer (ODO). Squadron commanders
   will designate only highly qualified individuals as ODO. Unit personnel eligible to be
   designated ODO are unit flying aircrew, flight test engineers and test engineers.
1.2. Waivers. Forward waiver requests, with justification, to HQ AFMC/A3V for review and
processing. HQ AFMC/A3V is the waiver approval authority.
1.2. (EDWARDSAFB)Forward all waiver requests, with justification, to 412 OG/OGV for
coordination. The 412 OG/CC, will be the waiver authority for this supplement.
1.3. Unit Supplements. Each unit will supplement this instruction to expand upon basic
guidance and incorporate local procedures.
   1.3.1. Submit unit supplements to HQ AFMC/A3V for review and approval. After final
   publication, forward a copy to HQ AFMC/A3V.

                                             Chapter 2

                               SUPERVISION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General . This instruction addresses two principal areas: SOF programs and squadron
supervision. The following requirements are established for AFMC flying units.
     2.1.1. SOF Programs. SOF programs will be established for oversight of flight operations
     involving fighter, attack and other single-place aircraft to include: F-15, F-16, F-22, F-35, A-
     10, T-38. SOF programs are optional for units operating multi-place aircraft. Det 2, WR-
     ALC only: follow Flight Safety Supervisor procedures IAW HQ AFMC/A3V approved local
     directives.
        2.1.1.1. Host-Tenant Agreements. The provisions of this paragraph apply to single-
        squadron organizations and other units not co-located with a parent wing or operations
        group (e.g., detachments, tenant units, geographically separated squadrons, etc.). In these
        units, SOF capability may be limited based on authorized manning. Commanders should
        consider integration with host base SOF programs when flying operations are compatible.
        Implement procedures through LOA/MOA and send a file copy to AFMC/A3V.
     2.1.2. Squadron Supervision. Units, particularly those without SOF programs, will
     maintain an appropriate level of supervisory oversight during flying operations. This is
     necessary to ensure awareness of scheduled operations, adequate mission support, and the
     ability to respond to significant issues. Each flying organization, however, has unique
     circumstances that are best addressed locally. The OG will establish minimum supervision
     requirements (e.g., required personnel, authorized locations, duty periods) in the unit
     supplement to this instruction.
     2.1.2. (EDWARDSAFB) The SOF/A, squadron supervisor, and ODO requirements set
     forth in this supplement are to be considered a minimum. Unit commanders should exercise
     good judgment and consider increased levels of supervision for increased risk testing, high-
     volume training, student training, adverse weather conditions, single runway operations and
     other missions as appropriate. Appropriately qualified individuals may perform any
     combination of SOF/A, squadron supervisor, and ODO duties simultaneously. The following
     equipment/publications will be available during flight operations:
        2.1.2.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Immediate access to aircraft flight manuals,
        checklists and Modification Flight Manuals.
        2.1.2.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) A suitable radio to communicate with the unit’s
        aircraft.
        2.1.2.3. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Scheduling information, including immediate access
        to crew and/or passenger list(s) for each aircraft.
        2.1.2.4. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) A copy of the SOF/A checklists (available at 412
        OG/OGV Sharepoint website).
     2.1.3. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) For units flying fighter/trainer aircraft, squadron
     commanders will ensure adequate MDS expertise is immediately available during flying
AFMCI11-201_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 1 MARCH 2013                                                    7


  operations. The MDS expertise requirement may be combined with SOF/A, squadron
  supervisor, ODO or control room.
  2.1.4. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Normal airfield operating hours are 0600-2200 Mon-Fri,
  0600-1400 Sat, and other times by NOTAM. Normal SOF/A duty hours are 0600 to sunset..
  Units flying outside of normal SOF/A duty hours will provide their own SOF/A per para.
  2.1.7. They will need to ensure a changeover is conducted between the departing and
  oncoming SOF/A. Weekend SOF/As should be prepared to cover 8 hours of flying unless
  otherwise scheduled.
     2.1.4.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) If there is a single fighter/trainer unit flying, the
     SOF/A may hand off SOF responsibilities to that unit’s SOF/A-qualified Sup or ODO
     (with FOA approval). SOF duties may also be accomplished from the duty desk for a
     single mission (multiple MDSs) with FOA approval on a case-by-case basis. SOF duties
     may only be transferred to a unit when Air Boss duties are no longer required. Whenever
     the SOF/A is operating out of the unit, ensure all required briefs from command
     post/weather/airfield management (opening SOF/A) or changeover brief (closing SOF/A)
     are obtained. Ensure that command post (7-3040) and the tower (7-2122) are notified of
     the new SOF/A’s name, unit, contact number and location.
  2.1.5. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) On weekdays, the opening SOF/A must be in the tower
  NLT 30 minutes prior to the first scheduled takeoff requiring a SOF/A IAW para. 2.1.7. until
  changeover. The closing SOF/A must be on duty from changeover until the last mission
  requiring a SOF/A IAW para. 2.1.7. has ceased movement on the airfield. The nominal
  changeover time for planning purposes is 1300L. However, changeover time may be set by
  mutual agreement of the opening and closing SOF/As involved. On weekends, the SOF/A
  must be on duty whenever missions requiring a SOF/A IAW para 2.1.7. are in progress. On
  the day prior to duty, SOF/As should access the flight schedule for their duty day by
  contacting the command post or the ROC, accessing CSE, or through any other means
  available to determine the required duty time.
     2.1.5.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) The SOF/A duty day begins when reporting for duty
     at airfield management or the unit. SOF/As and unit schedulers should consider the
     contingency of a 12-hour SOF/A duty day.
     2.1.5.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) No-show procedures. A no-show is defined as a
     SOF/A that has not called command post reporting for duty.
         2.1.5.2.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) If the SOF/A has not checked in with the
         command post by 30 minutes prior to the first scheduled takeoff, then command post
         will call Airfield Management to confirm whether a SOF/A has reported in. If the
         SOF/A has not reported in, then command post will contact the tasked unit
         (operations officer and/or duty desk) to get a suitable SOF/A replacement. If no
         contact with unit, then call the OG/CC. (On weekends, command post may have to
         contact tasked unit personnel at home).
         2.1.5.2.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) If the SOF/A is not in the tower when the first
         aircraft calls for taxi, tower personnel will contact command post to verify if SOF/A
         is enroute. If the SOF/A has still not checked in with the command post at takeoff
         time, command post will contact the OG/CC. Tower will not grant takeoff clearance

    southern Nevada. A more exact definition can be found in local instructions.
    2.1.7. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) A SOF/A is required anytime an EAFB aircraft is
    remaining within the local flying area, as defined in local instructions. For multi-place/RPA
    aircraft, a SOF/A is not required when a full set of flight manuals are readily available to the
    aircrew.
    2.1.8. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) A squadron supervisor is required anytime EAFB aircraft
    are remaining within the local flying area, as defined by local instructions. When outside the
    local area, a squadron supervisor is required when an EAFB aircraft is within 30 minutes of
    arrival to Edwards AFB. Additionally, a squadron supervisor is required when an EAFB
    aircraft is departing the local area until the aircraft is at least 30 minutes away from Edwards
    AFB.
    2.1.9. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) ODO requirements are determined by the unit.
    2.1.10. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) The SOF/A, squadron supervisor, and ODO
    requirements only apply to aircraft operations for which 412OG/CC maintains responsibility.
    2.1.11. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) The Air Boss program was established for oversight of
    flight operations within R-2515. SOF and Air Boss is a combined position.

 10                                 AFMCI11-201_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 1 MARCH 2013


   hours. For each weekend, one SOF/A will be scheduled for the entire weekend. SOF/A
   periods will be distributed among the flying units proportional to the number of SOF/A
   eligible personnel in each unit. The command post will maintain the master SOF/A schedule
   after it has been published.
       3.2.6.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) To assist in scheduling, units will provide
       412 OG/OGV with:
          3.2.6.1.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Factors affecting unit manning/availability
          during the next SOF/A scheduling period such as deployments, periods of reduced
          manning, etc.

       swaps and notify command post only when they swap tours with another unit.
3.3. Supervisor of Flying.
   3.3.1. Will be trained and certified IAW Chapter 7 of this instruction.
   3.3.2. For local missions (those departing from and recovering to home station), will be on
   duty a minimum of 30 minutes prior to first scheduled takeoff, and remain on duty until the
   last aircraft has landed.
   3.3.3. For operations outside the local area, such as cross-countries and delivery missions,
   the OG/CC will determine requirements for SOF coverage.
       3.3.3.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) For cross-countries, out-and-backs and delivery
       missions, see para 2.1.6 through para 2.1.10.
       3.3.3.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Extended missions are missions where the aircraft
       takes off and lands at Edwards but leaves the local flying area for a portion of the
       mission. SOF/A, squadron supervisor, and ODO requirements only apply during that
       portion of the mission when the aircraft is in the local flying area or would recover to
       Edwards in the event of a serious problem or emergency. For that portion of the
       extended mission when the aircraft is outside the local flying area and would probably
       recover elsewhere, the SOF/A, squadron supervisor, and ODO may be outside the unit in
       an “on call” status. The SOF/A, squadron supervisor, and ODO will provide command
       post and tower with their locations and phone numbers.
AFMCI11-201_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 1 MARCH 2013                                                         11


   3.3.4. Will be familiar with all scheduled missions during assigned duty periods.
   3.3.5. Will provide advice, assistance, and recommendations to aircrews, supervisors, and
   support agencies regarding unsafe or deteriorating flying conditions. The SOF has the
   authority to direct appropriate actions, on behalf of the OG/CC, to prevent/correct such
   conditions.
   3.3.5. (EDWARDSAFB) Due to the diverse nature of flying operations at Edwards and the
   unique requirements of each unit, the primary recall responsibility for aircraft must rest with
   the squadron supervisor and/or ODO in the individual flying units.
   3.3.6. Will, during in-flight emergencies or other abnormal situations, be available to
   provide aircrews assistance as necessary to safely recover the aircraft and crew.
   3.3.7. Will monitor the status of primary and emergency airfields and inform flying units of
   changes that may affect flight operations.
   3.3.8. Will determine suitability of, assign, and monitor weather alternates. During periods
   of deteriorating weather conditions, the SOF will also assist in the recovery of airborne
   aircraft.
   3.3.9. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) The SOF/A will keep the FOA and applicable squadron
   supervisor informed of factors that may adversely affect flying operations.
3.4. Squadron Supervisors.
   3.4.1. Will be on duty during periods specified in the unit supplement to this instruction.
   3.4.1. (EDWARDSAFB) A squadron supervisor will be available IAW para 2.1.8.
   Squadron supervisors will normally be available in the unit during local flying. If combined
   with ODO duty, the squadron supervisor/ODO should normally be located at the duty desk.
   3.4.2. May be used to provide technical assistance during in-flight emergencies when the
   SOF is not qualified in the distressed aircraft.
   3.4.2. (EDWARDSAFB) The squadron supervisor is the focal point within the unit for

  emergency he will focus on those duties and resume his dual role after the termination of the
  emergency. The SOF/A, in addition to normal SOF duties, will monitor the R-2515 airspace
  via the radar repeater and contact the SPORT watch supervisor with concerns.
  3.6.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) The SOF/A will coordinate airspace requirements through
  the SPORT Watch Supervisor or SPORT Operations Coordinator. In turn, SPORT Watch
  Supervisors or Operations Coordinators shall notify the Air Boss when
  circumstances/activities occur that will impact safe aircraft operations. The SPORT watch
  supervisor’s primary duty is that of SPORT watch supervisor; his secondary duty is to assist
  the SOF/A in reducing mid-air collision risk through deconfliction planning. The SOF/A is
  delegated the authority to require participating aircraft in R-2515 to change geographical
  location and/or altitudes or return to base.
  3.6.3. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) The combination of the pre-brief sheet and pre-takeoff
  coordination will be used by the Air Boss in consultation with SPORT to proactively
  deconflict R-2515 with a goal of simplifying operations for aircrew, minimizing traffic
  calls/conflicts, and improving safety. The SPORT watch supervisor will create a
  deconfliction plan and communicate the plan to the SOF/A via telephone, fax or e-mail prior
  to the first takeoff, at 1200 L and as required during the rest of the day. The SOF/A will
  review, modify and approve the plan. The watch supervisor will ensure the deconfliction plan
  is communicated to the aircrew during the pre-takeoff airspace brief. The SOF/A will
  continue to modify the R-2515 deconfliction plan real time throughout missions, while trying
  to minimize inputs and mission impact for participating crews.
  3.6.4. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Personnel assigned SOF/A duties will complete specified
  ground training before assuming duties. SOF/A training requirements are listed on AFMC
  Form 67 in COOL. Once all items on the AFMC Form 67 are complete, the trainee will
  schedule an interview with the OG/CC or designated representative. The OG/CC will sign-
  off the AFMC Form 67 in COOL, completing the SOF/A upgrade. Retain the original in the
  trainee’s primary aircraft training folder (if not in COOL).

                                INFLIGHT EMERGENCIES

4.1. Handling of In-Flight Emergencies. The primary objective during an
abnormal/emergency situation is the safe recovery of the aircrew and aircraft. Consider the
following when establishing unit procedures:
4.1. (EDWARDSAFB)Time permitting, the aircrew of an IFE aircraft should contact the
SOF/A and inform him/her of the nature of the emergency. The unit Sup/ODO will contact
the SOF/A to confirm the SOF/A and ATC personnel are aware of the emergency and prepared
to support it, and provide them all information pertinent to the emergency. This will ensure the
distressed aircraft is able to get the assistance it requires. The SOF/A will then be able to
provide the FOA with a full picture of the IFE.
   4.1.1. Provisions for a single, discrete frequency for recovering an emergency aircraft. ATC
   and the emergency aircrew should determine when to use a single frequency approach (SFA).
   4.1.1. (EDWARDSAFB) The SOF/A’s primary frequencies for communicating with
   distressed aircraft are UHF 308.7 or VHF 143.725. Additional VHF and UHF radios are
   available in the tower that can be tuned to other frequencies by tower personnel. The
   SOF/A’s call sign is Ponderosa 8.
   4.1.2. Procedures to notify appropriate agencies and key personnel of an IFE.
   4.1.2. (EDWARDSAFB) The SOF/A will notify the FOA and the appropriate squadron
   supervisor/ODO of an IFE or abnormal situation as soon as conditions permit using the FM
   radio, landline, command post or other suitable means per SOF/A checklist. In the event of a
   major emergency, the FOA may activate the IFE Response Team (IRT) IAW AFFTC Ops
   Plan 321. This will be activated through the crash net, command post, or as recommended
   by the FOA during coordination with the SOF/A. The SOF/A is also an advisor to the
   ground on-scene commander during ground emergencies, aircraft accidents, disaster
   responses and exercises involving the airfield.
   4.1.3. The prioritization of actions during simultaneous emergencies/abnormal situations.
   4.1.3. (EDWARDSAFB) The SOF/A, using inputs from the squadron supervisor/ODO and
   the FOA, will assist tower personnel in assigning landing priority. The SOF/A should
   consider halting or delaying test missions and other activities that may adversely affect the
   safe recovery of the distressed aircraft.
   4.1.4. CONFERENCE HOTEL Procedures for depot/contractor assistance. These
   procedures make aircraft specialists available by phone to the SOF and/or aircrew when in-
   flight situations pose systems-related questions that can't be answered at the local level. 24-
   hour CONFERENCE HOTEL support is provided by most aircraft manufacturers and/or Air
   Logistics Centers (ALCs). Consult the manufacturer/ALC for current telephone numbers and
   points of contact.
   4.1.4. (EDWARDSAFB) CONFERENCE HOTEL procedures are contained in the SOF/A
   checklists.

4.2. Restrictions.
   4.2.1. The final decision during any IFE/abnormal situation rests with the pilot in command.
   4.2.2. Unless intervening to prevent injury or loss of life, SOFs will not use air traffic control
   frequencies including the SFA frequency without ATC approval.
   4.2.3. Only the on-scene commander (normally the fire chief) can terminate an emergency.
AFMCI11-201_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 1 MARCH 2013                                                  15

5.1. SOF. The SOF will have a minimum of 12 hours crew rest prior to commencing crew duty
day.
5.2. Maximum duty day for SOF is 12 hours. Duty beyond this 12-hour period is authorized
only when the requirements of paragraph 5.2.1. are met.
   5.2.1. On a case by case basis, and with due consideration for safety, OG/CC’s may waive
   the 12-hour SOF duty day limitation up to a maximum of 16 hours. OG/CC’s may further
   delegate this waiver authority to the flying squadron commander level, but in no case will
   duty day be extended beyond 16 hours.
5.3. DNIF. DNIF crew members may perform SOF duties with flight surgeon approval. Flight
surgeons will make an appropriate entry on the AF Form 1042.
5.3. (EDWARDSAFB)Duty Not Including Flying (DNIF) crewmembers may also perform
squadron supervisor and ODO duty at the discretion of the flying squadron commander and
flight surgeon.
   5.3.1. Crewmembers on extended DNIF may not perform SOF duties once qualification in
   their assigned aircraft has expired.
