                                             DEFINITIONS

Section 1A—Definitions

1.1. Antenna. The wires, elements, or devices; transmission lines; terminating components; and hard-
ware required to function in an electromagnetic operational environment. The items constitute the user
owned "organizational property" to be maintained by the AF ISR Agency/A4M organization.

1.2. Antenna Support Structure System Installation. The process of obtaining approval for place-
ment, placing Antenna Support Structure System components in position for service, and transferring of
real property to the Host Support Organization.

1.3. Antenna Support Structure System Maintenance. It is the execution of inspections, preven-
tive-maintenance, and repairs to any antenna supporting structure system to extend its useful life and pre-
vent safety hazards.

1.4. Antenna Support Structure System. The supporting structures and attached guying members;
devices; and hardware required to support a single antenna in an operational environment. These items
constitute the real property items to be accounted for and maintained by the Host Support Organization.

1.5. Antenna System. It is all of the combined components of the Antenna and Antenna Support Struc-
ture System when considered as a single operational unit.

1.6. Gained Area. A grooved or notched area on the surface of a pole (which results in a flat or slightly
concave surface) providing a stable surface area to attach cross arms or other hardware.

1.7. Guy. A cable or rope attached at one end to an elevated part of a tower and at the other end to an
anchor, placed under tension, and used to secure a tower or pole.

1.8. Inspection Team. A joint team of at least four persons consisting of Host Support Organization per-
sonnel and AF ISR Agency/A4M/A7C personnel that inspects all antenna support structure systems at
regular time intervals.

1.9. Interface Point. The junction point between two components of an antenna system at which the
maintenance responsibility changes from one organization to another. The components on one side of the
interface point constitute the antenna support structure system and are real property. The components on
the other side of the interface point constitute the antenna and are organizational property.

1.10. In-house. In-house refers to Host Support Organization personnel or work done by those persons.
It includes the base-maintenance contractor at bases supported by a base-maintenance contract, and/or
host-country government agencies when base support is provided by such an agency, as well as Ser-
vice-Contract Support funded by either the Host Support Organization or the AF ISR Agency unit.

                                         RESPONSIBILITIES

Section 2A—Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency Responsibilities

2.1. Civil Engineering Division. AF ISR AGENCY/A7C:
    2.1.1. Ensures that all antenna support structures are identified and properly listed on the Host Sup-
    port Organizations Real Property Records.
    2.1.2. Provides qualified technical assistance upon request.
    2.1.3. Determines personnel and, or, real property interface points for new antennas. Negotiate these
    interface points with the Host Support Organization, if required.
    2.1.4. Provides field assistance when required.
    2.1.5. Coordinates with AF ISR AGENCY/A4M on all proposed antenna support structure installa-
    tions.

2.2. Director of Logistics, Installation, and Mission Support. AF ISR AGENCY/A4/7:
    2.2.1. Maintains a current listing of all AF ISR Agency antenna support structures.
    2.2.2. Provides field assistance when required.
    2.2.3. Coordinates with AF ISR AGENCY/A7C on all proposed antenna system maintenance or
    repair actions that may affect the antenna support structure system.

Section 2B—AF ISR Agency Unit’s Responsibilities
Note. SAFETY IS THE FIRST CONSIDERATION. The antenna environment is very dangerous and
all personnel involved shall pay particular attention to safety.

2.3. AF ISR Agency Unit Civil Engineer and Logistics Offices will:
    2.3.1. Coordinate with the Host Support Organization Real Property Officer to assure that any new
    installation of an antenna support structure system is sited, and approved by submitting an AF Form
    332, Base Civil Engineering Work Request, or the equivalent Host Support Organization Form if
    the Host is a non-USAF Agency. Approval must be received before start of non-emergency work.
    This applies to both in-house and all contract efforts.
       2.3.1.1. The installation of a new antenna support structure system will normally be Minor Con-
       struction and funded by AF ISR Agency or the Agency fielding the antenna. The antenna support
       structure system may be installed by either the Host Support Organization Civil Engineer as a con-
       struction project or by the Agency fielding the antenna as an AF ISR Agency Unit "Self-Help"
       project.
           2.3.1.1.1. Submit any Minor Construction (MC) work costing more than $2K on an antenna
           support structure system to AF ISR AGENCY/A4/7 through the AF ISR Agency Unit’s
           respective Group, Center, or Wing. The submittal shall include information detailing types of

           materials to be used that do not comply with the specifications and procedures in the applica-
           ble technical orders for the antenna being serviced.
           2.3.1.1.2. Submit work costing less than $2K on an antenna support structure system to the
           Host Support Organization for accomplishment. Submit request to AF ISR AGENCY/A4/7
           for approval of any materials to be used that do not comply with the specifications in the appli-
           cable technical orders for the antenna being serviced.
   2.3.2. Complete and submit to the Host Support Organization Real Property Officer a DD Form 1354,
   Transfer and Acceptance of Military Real Property, when antennas with real property components
   are installed.
   2.3.3. Coordinate with the Host Support Organization to assure that all reported antenna support
   structure system deficiencies are corrected on a timely basis.

2.4. Accounting and Responsibility. The Host Support Organization is responsible for accounting for,
and performing maintenance, on antenna support structure system components identified as real property
(see AFH 32-9007, Managing Air Force Real Property). The AF ISR Agency A4/7 is responsible for
accounting for, and performing maintenance on, antenna support structure systems identified as organiza-
tional property. These organizational property towers are not carried on the Host Support Organization
real-property records. Account for these towers through the Air Force Equipment Management System.
AF ISR Agency Policy is that, exclusive of tactical antennas utilized by deployable Units, there are gen-
erally no antenna support structure systems within AF ISR Agency. Maintenance support for organiza-
tional property antenna support structures can be accomplished through organic means, contractual
actions, or the Host Support Organization when included in an ISA. The interface points on those personal
property antenna structures (identified in Chapter 4) are valid only when agreement has been reached
with the Host Support Organization that it will, in fact, support these structures. The Host Support Orga-
nization’s maintenance and repair of organizational property antenna support structures may be on a reim-
bursable basis. The AF ISR Agency unit is responsible for identifying real property antenna support
structure systems to the Host Support Organization and assuring that the structures are included in the unit
ISA and listed in the Host Support Organization real property record.

2.5. Inspection Team. The Logistics maintenance officer at the AF ISR Agency Unit appoints at least
two team members from their organization, normally the corrosion-control monitor or the antenna main-
tenance supervisor and one or more certified climbers. Appoint all team members permanently, two of
which are qualified to climb tall structures according to AFOSHSTD 91-50, Communications Cable,
Antenna and Communications-Electronics (CE) Systems. A joint host support organization and the AF
ISR Agency Unit’s LG team accomplish all inspections except when specifically indicated.

2.6. Inspections.
   2.6.1. The AF ISR Agency Unit’s LG ensures that all inspections listed below are conducted:
       2.6.1.1. Every 90 days, unit personnel conduct a walk-through inspection of all antenna support
       structures and cable tunnels. Whenever possible, conduct this inspection during the second month
       of each quarter and invite the Host Support Organization personnel. No climbing is required for a
       closer inspection. Using binoculars will usually eliminate the need for climbing. Visually check
       towers for vertical alignment. Check guys, structural components, and aircraft warning lights with
       binoculars for obvious deficiencies. If any deficiency is noted that will endanger life or property or
8                                                                  AFISRAI32-1001 11 JANUARY 2008


       causes a loss to the mission, immediately correction is required Schedule other deficiencies for
       corrective action at the discretion of the Host Support Organization.
       2.6.1.2. After winds in excess of 75 mph (120 kilometers an hour) or after earth tremors of signif-
       icant magnitude, conduct a walk-through inspection giving special attention to guys, anchors, and
       vertical alignment.
       2.6.1.3. Conduct additional localized inspections whenever a problem is discovered that requires
       immediate, corrective action.
       2.6.1.4. Conduct a detailed, annual inspection according to Attachment 1. Schedule this inspec-
       tion during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year in place of the walk-through inspection for that
       quarter. Assist the Host Support Organization with all other real-property inspections and include
       all findings in the annual inspection report.
    2.6.2. For organizational property antenna support structure systems, the Host Support Organization
    is not required to participate in inspections according to this Instruction. The Unit LG conducts the
    inspections and monitors all noted deficiencies for the method of correction identified in paragraph
    2.3.
    2.6.3. AF ISR AGENCY/A4/7 personnel will be available to aid in the annual inspection of the AN/
    FLR-9 or other major antenna support structure systems. Request such assistance, if required from AF
    ISR Agency/A4/7, as applicable at least 90 days before the annual inspection.

2.7. Correcting Deficiencies:
    2.7.1. AF ISR Agency Unit/CE/LG will coordinate their efforts to:
       2.7.1.1. Review the antenna support structure facility folders (maintained by the Host Support
       Organization) quarterly, along with the 90-day walk-through inspection, for each AF ISR Agency
       real property antenna support structure system. Keep "personal property" antenna support struc-
       ture folders within the AF ISR Agency Unit, except when maintenance support is provided by the
       Host Support Organization and documented in the ISA. Review the records of all inspection,
       maintenance, and reporting actions in these folders.
       2.7.1.2. Ensure that deficiencies noted during inspections are corrected. Maintain record copies of
       walk-through inspections for reference and use them when conducting the annual inspection.
       2.7.1.3. Maintain in a history file a copy of the annual antenna support structure inspection report.
       The report must include:
           2.7.1.3.1. A listing of all deficiencies by antenna structure type and component.
           2.7.1.3.2. Programmed or performed corrective actions including such items as job order,
           work order, or project number.
           2.7.1.3.3. Estimated cost to correct each deficiency.
           2.7.1.3.4. Estimated completion dates; for facility projects, include programmed fiscal year.
           2.7.1.3.5. Single-line drawing showing location and types of all antenna support structure sys-
           tems for antennas as of the annual inspection.
       2.7.1.4. Review all Host Support Organization contracts associated with antenna support structure
       systems to ensure that the specifications contain a provision to require the contractor to minimize
AFISRAI32-1001 11 JANUARY 2008                                                                               9


       Radio-Frequency Interference (RFI) while working around the antennas, if the antennas must
       remain operational during the contract period. Due to basic design, there is no effective means to
       suppress interference from electrically powered, rotary hand tools (such as electric drills, buffers,
       and grinders). Therefore, specify sandblasting when possible for paint removal. If power tools
       must be used, specify pneumatic tools at least 50 meters away from the antenna field. Keep oper-
       ation of vehicles, self-propelled machinery (such as tractors, road graders, cement mixers, and
       forklift trucks), and other internal-combustion engines used by the contractor to a minimum on
       antenna field areas. When such items must be operated on a continuing basis within 50 meters of
       the antenna fields, vehicles shall be equipped with RFI-suppression equipment. The contractor
       must keep this suppression equipment in good working order. Perform RFI-producing work (such
       as arc welding) at a selected location at least 50 meters from the antenna field. When fre-
       quency-interference-producing work must be performed in the antenna field, the contractor must
       coordinate with the using agency before starting the work. Diesel engines can generally be
       exempted from these restrictions.
   2.7.2. AF ISR AGENCY/A4/7 will review the programmed work to ensure that the receiving capabil-
   ity of the antenna elements will not be affected by any of the materials to be used.

2.8. Removal of an Antenna Support Structure System. Host Support Organizations are not responsi-
ble for installing or removing any structure the AF ISR Agency unit retains as organizational property.
The AF ISR Agency unit LG notifies AF ISR AGENCY/A4/7 of any antenna support structure systems
that are to be removed. After AF ISR AGENCY/A4/7 approval of the removal is received, the AF ISR
Agency unit CE submits an AF Form 332, Host Support Organization form or the equivalent if the Host
is non-USAF, requesting the removal of the antenna support structure. Removal of the antenna support
structure system is generally a Host funded activity.

2.9. Replacing Major Parts of the Antenna Support Structure. This must be a joint operation
between the base Host Support Organization and the AF ISR Agency unit. Replace an entire antenna sup-
port structure system or major structural section of the structure only after it has been determined that it is
unsafe or uneconomical to maintain the structure in safe and serviceable condition. The AF ISR Agency
unit must remove and reinstall all parts of the antenna that they maintain. The Host Support Organization
will program for removing and reinstalling all parts of real property maintained structures. When neces-
sary, the Host Support Organization may arrange through the 70th Intelligence Wing for an Engineering
and Installation (E&I) team to support their requirement.

2.10. Reporting Work Requirements. The AF ISR Agency unit CE will report antenna support struc-
ture maintenance requirements to the Host Support Organization using local Base procedures. Report
emergency work as a service call.

                                                 Chapter 3

                           MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR PROCEDURES

Section 3A—Planning The Inspection

3.1. About this Chapter. This chapter is provided to be recommendations. It is not the intent to provide
a "Cookbook", but instead to provide items to consider when planning the inspection. An in-depth inspec-
tion of the major maintenance or repair requirements for any antenna support structure is necessary to
determine the safety hazards, required work involved, and materials needed to complete the task.

3.2. Deterioration. Time and weather deteriorate outside plant components; this degrades the system's
performance and creates potential hazards to both personnel and equipment. The deterioration process
will is accelerated if maintenance is not regularly and properly performed.

3.3. Corrective Action. The inspection team is not expected to perform corrective action.

3.4. Plant-In-Place (PIP) Records. PIP records consist of E&I documents and drawings applying to a
specific site. The layout, location, and configuration of the antennas are detailed in these data. The records
and drawings are available from the files of the operating organization. The inspection team chief ana-
lyzes the data to determine the antenna types, number, dimensions, supporting structures, and approxi-
mate year of installation. From these factors, the tool and technical-publication needs may be established.

3.5. Safety Precautions. Maintenance and repair personnel will be exposed to conditions requiring
safety precautions against injury and loss of life or damage to equipment at all times. In addition to the
specific safety precautions listed in the referenced installation manuals, observe the following:
WARNING: LIVE, TRANSMITTING, ANTENNA SYSTEMS' WIRING IS LETHAL. Verity that the
system you will work on is DE-ENERGIZED, that the transmitter power is OFF, locked out if applicable,
and that both sides of the transmitter line are grounded or disconnected before working on the antenna
wiring. Post signs at main disconnects and rotating mechanism controls stating: "DANGER DO NOT
ENERGIZE - MEN WORKING ON ANTENNAS".
     3.5.1. Inspect the Guying Components. Before proceeding aloft, personally inspect the guying of the
     support structures for soundness. Do not perform work of any kind on the guys of antenna support
     structures upon which other personnel are working. Brief safety observers on work to be done and
     ensure that they are positioned where they can see the climber while controlling access to the area
     beneath the structure.
     3.5.2. Releasing Tension from a Permanent Guy. Before releasing a permanent guy from tension,
     have a temporary guy-line in place, anchored, and tensioned to accept the support loading. Install
     safety guying on a one-for-one basis. THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL PROCEDURE.
     3.5.3. Wear and Use Safety Equipment. Wear a protective helmet, safety shoes or boots, gloves, and
     goggles as prescribed. Use safety-climbing devices.
     3.5.4. Establish, understand, and use hand signals when two or more persons are working on the same
     system.
AFISRAI32-1001 11 JANUARY 2008                                                                       11


   3.5.5. Refer to TO 31Z-10-4, Electromagnetic Radiation Hazards, for safety information on radiation
   hazard zones.

3.7. Technical-Data Requirements. You may need technical orders, manuals, and drawings for specific
antennas to conduct inspection, maintenance, and repair procedures (Attachment 2 and Attachment 3).

3.8. Referencing Antenna Components. It is important that the individual components of the support
structure which have been inspected are located and marked on the layout drawing so that individual defi-
ciencies are accurately recorded and identified. This may be accomplished by using a marked copy of the
PIP drawings for the site. Major components (such as guys, anchors, and supports) may be numbered,
coded, and marked with pencil on the drawing and this identification transferred to the report sheet.

Section 3B—Performing the Inspection

3.9. Purpose of Inspection. The inspection is conducted to:
     3.9.1. Determine the specific areas requiring maintenance and, or restoration and the type and extent
     of work required to meet safety and operational standards.
     3.9.2. Complete a list of materials required to perform maintenance and repairs.

3.10. Preliminary Instructions. Before the inspection, the team will coordinate with the operational
organization responsible for the antenna operation. The team:
     3.10.1. Makes its purpose and requirements known and requests the AF ISR Agency Unit/LG advice
     and assistance in obtaining required information during the survey.
     3.10.2. Obtains PIP records and antenna layout drawings and discusses sequence of operations to be
     followed with the operational organization.
     3.10.3. Identifies individual antennas and components on the layout drawing.
     3.10.4. Requests approval from the operational organization for use of technical manuals as available.
     3.10.5. Advises the organization of required "downtime" for operational antennas during the inspec-
     tion.
     3.10.6. Determines the area and location of radiation-hazard zones.

3.11. Inspection Team's Responsibilities. The inspection team's responsibilities include:
     3.11.1. Ensuring strict compliance with the safety provisions of AFOSHSTD 91-50.
     3.11.2. Physically examining and inspecting the antenna support structures' components and any
     installed safety climbing devices.
     3.11.3. Evaluating structural units for operational and safety conditions.
     3.11.4. Recommending maintenance, repair, or replacement of impaired items.

3.12. Corrosion. The primary problem area in antenna plant maintenance is the corrosion of metallic
hardware components caused by oxygen and moisture. The severity of corrosion and the length of time
necessary to bring metallic components to the end of their useful life depend upon the environmental con-
dition, exposure time, and the composition of the metal plating. Most antenna hardware is fabricated from
iron or steel and finished with hot-dipped, galvanized plating of zinc alloy. This hardware is satisfactory
because it resists corrosion; however, it must be regularly inspected for condition, safety, and degree of
AFISRAI32-1001 11 JANUARY 2008                                                                            13


deterioration after prolonged exposure to the elements. The following two corrosion processes are the pri-
mary cause of metal deterioration in antenna support structures:
   3.12.1. Natural Corrosion. Atmospheric or natural corrosion is of primary importance. Metal corro-
   sion may appear as a powdery scale, heavy rust, or pitting, all of which result in disintegration of the
   metal. Salt spray, salt water, industrial fumes, and high relative humidity accelerate the corrosion rate.
   Steel will corrode if the relative humidity is higher than about 30 percent. Within a short time, a coat-
   ing of rust will form on the metal. This rust is porous and will retain moisture that accelerates the pro-
   cess. The cycle continues unchecked until the plating material scales and peels off. Removing rust
   scale; treating the exposed metal; and applying a protective coating can retard this corrosion process.
   3.12.2. Galvanic Corrosion. The Galvanic corrosion process:
       3.12.2.1. Takes place when metals of dissimilar composition or plating (steel and aluminum, zinc
       and copper) are in bonded contact with each other in a moist environment. This potentially serious
       condition may be overlooked or disregarded by those engaged in inspecting and evaluating
       antenna hardware since the familiar signs of rust and scale are not readily apparent. This type of
       corrosion is identified by the presence of a powdery film and pitting of one of the metals, and will
       result in rapid deterioration of that metal component.
       3.12.2.2. Greatly accelerates in areas of salt spray or salt-laden atmosphere. Galvanized hardware
       is widely used in antenna systems. When used with aluminum or stainless-steel hardware, it is
       advisable to make a closer examination of corrosion areas that may be supporting galvanic action
       between dissimilar hardware. In general, it is an undesirable condition when two dissimilar metals
       or platings are directly connected in outside plant installations. This is especially true in coastal
       areas where the presence of salt air promotes electrolytic action to the extent that one of the metals
       may be eaten away entirely within a very short period of time.

3.13. Evaluating Natural Corrosion. For the purpose of this instruction, the following guidelines have
been established:
   3.13.1. First-Degree Corrosion. The initial stages of oxidation or rusting begin soon after the metal is
   exposed to the elements. In saltwater areas, this stage becomes evident quickly; in less severe environ-
   ments, the process is more gradual.
       3.13.1.1. Identification. A powdery coating of gray or brown dust on the metal; brown discolora-
       tion of the metal and adjacent areas caused by dripping water.
       3.13.1.2. Evaluation. The coating can be wiped off by hand or with a cloth.
       3.13.1.3. Example. The brown dust that forms on stainless steel wire of dissipation lines, the
       white or gray dust on a galvanized guy strand.
       3.13.1.4. Action. No corrective action is necessary or practical at this stage of the corrosion cycle.
   3.13.2. Second-Degree Corrosion. This is an intermediate stage of corrosion that becomes evident
   after a longer period of time depending upon the metal, metal plating, and environment.
       3.13.2.1. Identification. Patches of brown rust, light scaling, surface pitting, and general degrada-
       tion of the metal.
14                                                                 AFISRAI32-1001 11 JANUARY 2008


        3.13.2.2. Evaluation. Rust and scale is difficult or impossible to pick off with the fingernail; bolt
        threads are rusted, ragged with eaten thread edges; and rust and scale appear on 50 percent of the
        component.
        3.13.2.3. Example. The rusted threads of steel tower and guy hardware bolts; surface pitting of
        wire-rope clamps; and rust scale on hardware from which galvanized plating has been removed
        through mechanical damage.
        3.13.2.4. Action. For this stage of corrosion, a program for cleaning and treating the rusted areas
        or for future replacement as required. The decision to treat or replace corroded parts must be based
        on the corrosiveness of the local environment and the minimum lead-time to obtain corrective
        action. Second-degree corrosion alone does not justify immediate replacement since the metal and
        threads are still structurally sound and will sustain the applied loading until the next annual inspec-
        tion at which time a further evaluation may be made.
     3.13.3. Third-Degree Corrosion. This is the advanced stage and imminent danger point in the corro-
     sion cycle. Hardware components of this category have been exposed to the elements, directly buried
     in the ground, or in a saltwater environment for an extended period of time.
        3.13.3.1. Identification. Heavy scaling of rust; deep pitting of the base metal; complete lack of the
        original plating; and holes rusted through the metal.
        3.13.3.2. Evaluation. Heavy rust scale can be easily picked off with a knife blade; scale can be
        knocked off in large pieces; threaded parts are badly disintegrated; and more than 50 percent of the
        component displays one or more of the above faults.
        3.13.3.3. Example. Guy strand that does not meet the criterions of Table 3.2.; buried portions of
        anchor rods corroded to diameters of the minimum criterions of Table 3.3.; guy strand with one or
        more rusted and broken wires of the core; parts of bolt threads completely rusted off; and steel
        tower members devoid of galvanized plating with base metal corroded to second degree.
NOTE: A cardboard gage patterned after Figure 3.1. to aid in inspecting guys and anchors may be made.
        3.13.3.4. Action. Replace all components that are evaluated to be in the third-degree category or
        are borderline cases to it. Program large, bulky, or difficult-to-replace items for replacement.

3.14. Evaluating Galvanic Corrosion. Galvanic corrosion results from the electrical contact of two dis-
similar metals or plating in an environment that promotes a small electric current to pass between the met-
als. During this conduction process, one of the metals disintegrates or corrodes. When this action
continues, complete destruction of the affected metal occurs while the other metal retains its original con-
dition.
     3.14.1. Electrolytic Action. The electrolytic action from the high potential metal (anode) to the low
     potential metal (cathode) causes corrosion of the anode through electrochemical processes. Alumi-
     num, stainless steel, copper, and zinc galvanizing exhibit good resistance when used alone. When
     these metals are installed in physical contact with one another (for example, aluminum with zinc) in
     an electrolyte environment (for example, moist air or soil), degrees of reaction result and galvanic cor-
     rosion occurs.
     3.14.2. Galvanic Series. Acceleration of the corrosion occurs when the components are exposed to
     salt moisture, salt spray, or industrial fumes. Direct contact of dissimilar metals widely displaced in
     the galvanic series (such as aluminum and brass) must be avoided. Antenna systems maintenance or
AFISRAI32-1001 11 JANUARY 2008                                                                            15


      repair personnel will be concerned with aluminum in contact with galvanized and copper components;
      stainless steel with galvanized or aluminum hardware; and copper wire, guy strand, aluminum, or
      stainless steel with silver solder. Consider these items:
         3.14.2.1. Identification. Check for a residue of white or brown flakes or powder at the metal con-
         tact areas; pitting of one of the metals; and pitting of one metal with the other remaining untar-
         nished.
         3.14.2.2. Evaluation. The powder can be brushed off the metal by hand or with a cloth; flakes can
         be removed or picked off with a knife blade; and, at the advanced stage, one of the metals has dis-
         integrated to the extent that the component is noticeably reduced in size.
         3.14.2.3. Example. Aluminum guy hardware used with galvanized hardware or copper-clad guy
         strand; stainless-steel balls of automatic guy clamps in contact with aluminum, copper, or galva-
         nized fittings bonded or attached to aluminum housing.
         3.14.2.4. Action. Eliminate the dissimilar metals' contact points by totally replacing with hard-
         ware of the same plating (for example, zinc-to-zinc, copper-to-copper); or isolate the metals from
         each other with insulators, rubber or plastic sleeves, or insulating tape.
CAUTION: Isolating the metal components may reduce or void the grounding and lightning protection
features that may have been built into the system. Complete replacement is necessary when one of the
metals has suffered such serious deterioration as deep pitting, holes through the metal, or visible reduction
in size of portions of the component. This stage of galvanic corrosion is serious and the corroded part
should be replaced by a part made from the same type metal as the adjoining parts. Often, the only correc-
tive action possible is replacing hardware with the same type hardware or by isolating the contact sur-
faces.

3.15. Concrete Fixtures. Refer to TO 31-10-5, Standard Installation Practices-Concrete Pads and Piers
for Ground C-E Equipment.
     3.15.1. Inspection. Inspect concrete piers, pedestals, pads, and pole footings for cracks, breaks, and
     chipping of concrete. Report large cracks or breaks for repair.
     3.15.2. Repair. Perform minor concrete repairs as follows:
        3.15.2.1. With chisel and hammer, chip out the defective area to a depth sufficient to remove loose
        fragments and reach solid concrete. Undercut the edges of the repair area to provide a good hold-
        ing surface for the new concrete.
        3.15.2.2. Remove loose concrete and install wooden forms as necessary. Thoroughly wet down
        the prepared area.
        3.15.2.3. Prepare a grout mixture of one part cement and one part sand. Use enough water to make
        a workable mixture of plastic consistency when applied. Do not use more water than is required.
        The strength of the grout decreases as more water is added.
        3.15.2.4. Build up the repair area with successive layers of grout until the final layer is slightly
        higher than the surrounding surface of the concrete.
        3.15.2.5. When the grout stiffens, smooth with a trowel, and cure by placing wet rags over the
        area. Allow curing until set.

3.16. Tilted Tower Pier:
     3.16.1. Inspection. Inspect for extent of tilt, misalignment, and shifting that may be caused by soil
     erosion, loose guys, or improper placement. All tower legs must rest on the pier and bear on it equally.
     Check the top of the pier for level, and report those which in your judgment require corrective action.
AFISRAI32-1001 11 JANUARY 2008                                                                           17


   3.16.2. Repair. When concrete has settled evenly, adjust guy tensions to compensate for residual slack
   in the strand. Misaligned tower legs may be shimmed with galvanized sheet steel or galvanized wash-
   ers. Fill washed-out areas around the pier base with fine-graded subsoil and tamp thoroughly.

3.17. AS-106 Tower Pedestal:
   3.17.1. Inspection. Inspect the steel cap of the pedestal for cracks or splits in the metal.
NOTE: Some older installations (models A and B of the AS-105 tower) used the kit-supplied, steel ped-
estal rather than a concrete pier. However, the pedestal cap was subject to severe cracking and splitting
under loads on extended height towers. Report all cases of this type and recommend total cap replacement
or judicious use of welding techniques for repair. When total cap replacement is indicated, recommend
construction of a new concrete pier for the tower.
   3.17.2. Repair. Welding the crack or split is a fast means of correction. Total replacement requires that
   the tower be completely dismantled and re-erected.

3.18. Antenna Supports - Poles:
   3.18.1. Vertical Alignment. Reference publications are TO 31-10-19, Anchors and Supports; TO
   31-10-21, Protection, Stepping, and Splicing of Poles.
       3.18.1.1. Inspection. Consider a pole out of vertical alignment when its center at the top is 15
       inches or more out of alignment with the center of the butt at the ground line.
           3.18.1.1.1. Antenna support vertical alignment is best determined with a surveyor's transit. At
           a suitable distance from the pole, set up, level, and align the transit to a position 90 degree
           from the first observation and record the misalignment.
           3.18.1.1.2. Record out-of-vertically-aligned poles by antenna and pole number.
       3.18.1.2. Repair. Vertically align the pole by adjusting guy tensions as required. Excavate around
       the butt for poles excessively out-of-vertical-alignment, and use the plumb bob or transit for pre-
       cise alignment.
   3.18.2. Lightning Protection:
       3.18.2.1. Inspection. Antenna support poles 35 feet high and over is required to have static-drain
       lightning protection installed only if guy wires contain insulators. Report poles with incorrect gap
       distance, loose wiring, missing staples, and wire sections by pole number. Initial installation of
       lightning arrestors is not a Host Support Organization responsibility.
       3.18.2.2. Repair. Replace missing sections of the #6 wire as necessary. Adjust gap distances to 2
       inches as required. Check for and tighten ground-rod clamps where used.
   3.18.3. Stepping:
       3.18.3.1. Inspection. Reference publication is TO 31-10-21. Standard practices dictate that all
       antenna support poles be equipped with pole stepping. Inspect for bent, loose, and missing steps.
       3.18.3.2. Repair. Replace missing or damaged steps.
   3.18.4. Pole Rot and Decay:
18                                                               AFISRAI32-1001 11 JANUARY 2008


       3.18.4.1. Pole Description. For pole inspection and evaluation purposes, the critical pole area is
       considered to be 4 inches above the ground line to 18 inches below it. Beyond this depth, the air is
       blocked by compaction of the surrounding earth and the possibility of fungi growth is diminished.
       The small column of wood at the ground line is the most important single component of pole
       strength and presents decay problems that cannot be evaluated by visual inspection alone. Visual
       inspection and sounding at the ground line of treated poles will satisfy rehabilitation survey
       requirements for poles installed 10 years or less. Poles installed for more than 10 years must
       undergo the inspections and evaluations as outlined.
NOTE: Figure 3.2. and its index may be used to evaluate wood decay.
       3.18.4.2. Inspection. Inspect and evaluate poles as follows:
          3.18.4.2.1. Performing the sounding test. With a hand sledge or lineman's hammer, strike the
          pole surface at the ground line at various points to 2 feet above it. Strike the pole sharply with
          full hammer face blows. Areas free of decay will produce a sharp clear sound with a forceful
          rebound of the hammer. Unsound or decayed wood, hollow spots, or voids beneath the shell
          will produce a hollow thump, the hammer's head will penetrate the shell, or the rebound will
          be weak. Mark such locations with wax crayon or chalk.
          3.18.4.2.2. Making a penetration test. To do this, measure the depth that a blunt ice pick or awl
          point can be forced into the wood by hand pressure alone. If the point penetrates more than 1
          inch, the wood in the immediate area is rotted.
          3.18.4.2.3. Excavate around the pole butt to a depth of 15 inches. Allow enough space to turn
          the auger brace.
          3.18.4.2.4. Inspect below ground line for decay and rot. Using the pointed tool, prod the pole
          surface at various points around the pole butt. If the probe cannot be pushed more than 1/2
          inch into the wood, the pole is serviceable at those locations.
          3.18.4.2.5. Carefully cut away the surface rotted pockets to the good wood. If no more than
          two pockets are found around the pole circumference, the pole may be considered as service-
          able. More than two pockets or a continuous pocket around most of the pole circumference
          requires that the pole be bored and evaluated for heart rot.
          3.18.4.2.6. Perform a bore test. Using the 1/8-inch bit (18 Inches long), drill a hole to the near
          center of the pole. Be sure the hole is horizontally bored and not slanted downward. The outer
          wood chips should show definite signs of the black creosote treatment of the shell. Penta or
          other treatment will be indicated by light brown or whitish chips. Beneath the shell, the chips
          should be firm, clear wood and have the feel of sound timber. If heart rot, insect or fungi
          growth, or other infection is present, the chips bored from the pole center will be soft and
          spongy and of a brown or black color.

INDEX TO FIGURE 3.2


Legend Explanation
A      No rot or decay areas; heart wood is solid and uniform; pole has wood preservative
       penetration of more than 2 inches or 85 percent of the sapwood. Poles in this condition
       will last indefinitely.
B      Depth of penetration of wood preservative less than "A" or about 75 percent of the
       sapwood treated; no evidence or rot or decay. Pole can be expected to remain free of rot
       for 5 years.
C      Depth of penetration of wood preservative 1 1/2 inches or about 65 percent treated wood.
       Predicted shorter life than "A" or "B" with regular inspection required.
D      Sounding this pole may indicate a hollow condition due to the horizontal internal cracks
       and the vertical outer split in the wood. Watch closely for deep outer cracks and inspect
       regularly.
E      Indicates rot and decay at the pole heart. Can be detected by boring. This pole condition
       requires regular inspection.
F      Enclosed rot and decay pocket. Extent can be determined by sounding and boring as
       detailed in text.
G      Open decay pocket. If 1/2 inch of shell covers the pocket, consider as an open decay
       pocket. See text for details of evaluation.
H      Exposed decay pocket on the side of pole, treat same as "G" above.
I      Large exposed pocket with remaining sapwood in poor condition. Assume the decay will
       spread and inspect hole regularly.
J      Large exposed decay pocket on side of pole with remaining sapwood in poor condition,
       treat same as "I" above. See text.

            3.18.4.2.7. Extract the auger bit from the hole; clean the hole of all residues; and, with a long
            screwdriver or heavy wire, probe the sides of the hole near the center. This probing will indi-
            cate how far the heart rot extends to the pole surface as the probe will easily penetrate the soft
            rotted areas of the inner core.
NOTE: When SOUNDING indicates hollow spots, PENETRATION of the probes proves it.
            3.18.4.2.8. When removal of the rotted parts shows more than two pockets or a shallow
            pocket around most of the pole circumference and BORE TESTING certifies the presence of
            heart rot, condemn the pole as unfit and unsafe for further use.
            3.18.4.2.9. When hollow spots are present but no heart rot is found, apply creosote paint or
            other wood preservative to the exposed areas. Insert creosote treated wooden dowels in the
            holes that were bored and backfill the excavated area around the butt mounding the earth to
            facilitate water runoff.

3.19. Antenna Supports - Towers:
     3.19.1. Inspection. Reference publications are TO 3lR2-2FRC-131, Antenna Support, AB-105C; and
     TO 3lR2-2FRC-161, Antenna Support, AS-105A/AB-1058.
        3.19.1.1. Vertical Alignment. Inspect towers for departures from the vertical; such as bows,
        warps, and vertical alignment. The preferred method of accomplishing this is by using one or two
        surveyor's transits. Set up the transits 90 degrees apart and at tower-length distance from the base.
        Sight the vertical hairline on a tower leg near the base. Lock the instrument and move the eyepiece
        up the leg of the tower observing whether the edge of the tower leg stays in line with the transit's
        hairline. If two transits are not available, one unit must be used at the two points of measurement,
        90 degrees apart. The standard criterion for tower vertical alignment is no more than 1 inch for
        each 50 feet of structure height.
        3.19.1.2. Corrosion. Inspect tower hardware, nuts, bolt threads, steel members, and attachment
        hardware for second- and third-degree corrosion.
        3.19.1.3. Hardware. Inspect for loose or missing hardware. Check for twisted, bent, or heavily
        corroded (third degree) vertical and horizontal members, guy plates, and attachment hardware.
        3.19.1.4. Grounding. Inspect the grounding system at the base of a tower. At least two legs of a
        tower with insulated guys should be bonded and attached to a ground rod with #2 or #6 AWG cop-
        per wire and assorted clamps.
        3.19.1.5. Paint. Inspect for peeling, faded, or dirty paint. Report areas that require either touchup
        or overall painting. Painting for obstruction and marking is required in designated areas of air traf-
        fic. It is necessary that painting be done when the warning pattern becomes faded, discolored, or
        peels off the structure. Report all such conditions.
     3.19.2. Repair. Repair steel antenna supports as follows:
        3.19.2.1. Using the transit method as described in paragraph 3-2la(l), adjust tower vertical align-
        ment with the turnbuckles associated with each guy. Refer to the applicable manual for directions
        for using the dynamometer. See TO 31-10-19 for data on this subject. Reaching the condition of
        proper vertical alignment is more important than trying to maintain equal tension on all guys.
AFISRAI32-1001 11 JANUARY 2008                                                                               23


       3.19.2.2. Replace all third-degree corroded components as indicated on the inspection report.
       Replace all missing nuts, bolts, and steel members as reported.
       3.19.2.3. Replace all third-degree corroded hardware. Tighten loose nuts and bolts. Replace miss-
       ing units as recorded on the report. Use a 6-inch wrench, open end or box, on the 3/8-inch nuts on
       AB-105 towers to avoid stripping bolt threads.
       3.19.2.4. Tighten grounding connections to the tower legs and ground clamps when applicable.
       Replace corroded, missing, and damaged parts as necessary. If present, tighten grounding bonds
       between tower sections.
       3.19.2.5. Make sure surface is clean before applying paint. Remove oil, grease, loose rust, and
       mill scale. Remove oil and grease with nonflammable cleaning solvents. Use a wire brush to bring
       the surface to a bright finish. Prime the surface with zinc chromate or red lead paint. Clean galva-
       nized surfaces with solvent and treat them with zinc-oxide-zinc dust primer (Federal Specifica-
       tions TT-P-641). Use exterior alkyd base paint for final coat.
       Note - Do not paint the turnbuckle body or threads. Apply rust preventive grease or rust inhibitor
       to the turnbuckle, body or threads.

3.20. Guys and Anchors. Guying defects and corrosion of guy strand will be a major part of the work
included in the maintenance and repair program. Establish a systematic method by working one antenna
system at a time. Identify guylines on the antenna layout drawing. They may be coded as follows:


Al, A2, A3 Bottom set of guys              (A set)
Bl, B2, B3 First intermediate set          (B set)
Cl, C2, C3     Second intermediate set (C set)
T1, T2, T3     Top set of guys         (T set)

   3.20.1. Guy and Anchor Rod Corrosion:
       3.20.1.1. Inspection. Third-degree corrosion of galvanized guy strand displays severe flaking of
       the zinc plating (the residue of which can be picked off with a knife blade) and deep pitting and
       rusting of the strand wires.
             3.20.1.1.1. Consider guy strand as unsafe for further use when one or more broken or severed
             wires are present.
             3.20.1.1.2. Condemn a strand that does not meet the diameter criterions of Table 3.2. Table
             3.2. lists strand diameter tolerances of the most commonly installed guy strands. When the
             measured diameter of the strand is at or below that given in the table, the strand is a safety haz-
             ard and must be replaced.
       3.20.1.2. Micrometer Measurements. Use a micrometer, as listed in Table 3.1., to measure the
       guy strand and anchor-rod diameters for compliance with the criterions of the diameter tables. The
       micrometer should measure to thousandths of an inch.
             3.20.1.2.1. Strand Diameter Measurements. To measure the diameter of guy strand, proceed
             as follows:
24                                                                 AFISRAI32-1001 11 JANUARY 2008


                3.20.1.2.1.1. Clean the surface of the strand with abrasive cloth or by light filing. Remove
                scaled rust and smooth the circumference of the strand for about 2 inches at the corroded
                point. Do not remove or disturb the rust between wires of the strand.
                3.20.1.2.1.2. Since the guy wire must be under tension, measure the strand diameter at the
                selected point using the micrometer.
                3.20.1.2.1.3. Record the micrometer reading and refer to the strand diameter criterions of
                Table 3.1.
                3.20.1.2.1.4. When the measured strand diameter is at or below the replacement size given
                in the table, condemn the strand.
                3.20.1.2.1.5. Replace guy strand according to the procedures in TO 31-10-19.
            3.20.1.2.2. Anchor Rod Diameter Measurements. The importance of properly inspecting the
            condition of guy anchor rods cannot be overly stressed. Anchor rods originally placed with
            tape-coat protection and guy line insulators can be assumed in good condition. Correctly
            treated rods will show the tape coating intact on the rod below the attached eye. In saltwater
            areas, spot-check several rods throughout the site to gain an idea of environmental conditions
            in the area. Without tape-coat treatment, a buried rod will display a corrosive condition to var-
            ious degrees. Third-degree corrosion in saltwater areas can result in deterioration of the rods
            below ground line to a condition in which a 5/8-inch diameter rod can be corroded to the size
            of a lead pencil.
                3.20.1.2.2.1. Inspection. Evaluate the condition of anchor rods as follows:
                    3.20.1.2.2.1.1. Excavate the earth around the rod to a depth of 18 inches. Untreated
                    rods will show a degree of rust, scale, and pitting of the metal.
                    3.20.1.2.2.1.2. Clean the deposit of maximum corrosion with sandpaper or file so that
                    the base metal can be seen.
                    3.20.1.2.2.1.3. Measure the rod diameter and record the value. Refer to the anchor rod
                    diameter criterions of Table 3.3.
                    3.20.1.2.2.1.4. Condemn and replace rods that have corroded to the replacement size
                    or less. Use tape-coat treatment in saltwater areas.
                3.20.1.2.2.2. Repair. Replace defective anchors.
     3.20.2. Guy Tension. Dynamometer testing individual guy lines for proper tension on a large antenna
     farm is both a tedious and cumbersome task. The tensiometer listed in Table 3.1. will make inspecting
     much easier and is faster to use than the standard dynamometer. The tensiometer merely clamps onto
     the guy and thus is not placed in series with the load. Often, experienced personnel can detect exces-
     sive sag and improper tension by a visual examination. The following information should help field
     personnel detect, inspect, and evaluate guy tensions:
        3.20.2.1. Reference TO 31-10-19 for information on making guy-tension measurements with the
        dynamometer, chain hoist, and smooth-jaw cable grip.
        3.20.2.2. To accurately measure guy tension, use the lever-cam (shunt type) dynamometer (tensi-
        ometer). To measure tension with a traction (series type dynamometer, place the instrument in
AFISRAI32-1001 11 JANUARY 2008                                                                          25


       series with the load to be measured. You will need a chain hoist (coffin hoist), smooth jaw cable
       grip (come-along), and hardware.
           3.20.2.2.1. Attach the chain hoist hook to the anchor-rod eye of the guyline to be measured.
           3.20.2.2.2. Attach the cable grip to the strand and position it aligned with the hoist. Attach a
           shackle or other device (clevis) so that the dynamometer can be mated to the cable grip.
           3.20.2.2.3. Continue operating the hoist handle slowly until the guy strand shows a slight sag;
           then remove the loading from the anchor and place it onto the dynamometer rigging. Read the
           tension in pounds on the meter.
           3.20.2.2.4. Slowly release tension and place the loading back to the anchor line. Remove the
           dynamometer rigging.
   3.20.3. Hardware. In the past, unnecessary replacement of hardware has occurred simply because cor-
   rosion existed and immediate replacement was recommended. This resulted in unwarranted cost and
   expended man-hours. Do not consider replacing hardware unless the inspection team decides that
   third-degree corrosion is present.
       3.20.3.1. Inspection. Inspect and record for repair or replacement the following items of guy hard-
       ware:
           3.20.3.1.1. Cracked or broken strain insulators.
           3.20.3.1.2. Missing guy clips for the strand tails.
           3.20.3.1.3. Missing turnbuckle safety ties on guy lines.
           3.20.3.1.4. Loose or missing wire-rope clamps, clips, bolts, thimbles, and turnbuckles. All
           tower guys must be equipped with turnbuckles at the anchor rod ends.
       3.20.3.2. Repair. (Refer to TO 31-10-9).
           3.20.3.2.1. Tighten loose hardware as listed in the inspection report. Secure thimbles as shown
           in Figure 3.3.
           3.20.3.2.2. Apply a coating of light grease or rust inhibitor to turnbuckle threads.
           3.20.3.2.3. Install safety ties on turnbuckles as required.
           3.20.3.2.4. Replace broken strain insulators mounted in the guys.

3.21. Obstruction Markings for Aircraft. In the vicinity of air traffic, antenna poles and towers are
equipped with obstruction painting or marker lighting or both. Alternate stripes of orange and white paint
for day marking is standard while red warning lights are used at night. The requirements, practices, and
methods relative to the marking of aircraft obstructions are controlled by Federal law and applicable
AFI’s.
   3.21.1. Inspection. Inspect and report the following conditions:
       3.21.1.1. Poles and towers for faded, weathered, and deteriorated paint that is poorly defined, dif-
       ficult to see, or otherwise indicates the necessity for repainting.
       3.21.1.2. Marker lighting for burned-out bulbs, cracked or broken glass globes, and missing hard-
       ware. Check for loose cables or conduits attached to the supporting structure.

        3.21.1.3. Conduit junction boxes for the presence of water, wiring for solid attachment to sup-
        ports, and conduit fittings for third-degree corrosion.
        3.21.1.4. Photocell and flasher units for proper operation. Cover the cell opening with your hat or
        a dark cloth. Observe relay and lamp for operation. Relays should operate, motor should run, and
        lamps should illuminate and flash. Verify that the photocell faces the northern sky.
     3.21.2. Repair. A manual or drawing showing the schematic diagram of the obstruction lighting sys-
     tem should be in the files of the operating organization.
        3.21.2.1. Replace lamps, making sure they are firmly seated in the sockets. Verify that the replace-
        ment lamp is the same number, wattage, and voltage as the lamp being replaced.
        3.21.2.2. Clean the inside and outside of the prismatic globes with cloth and detergent soap.
        Replace cracked and broken units.
        3.21.2.3. Remove dust, dirt, and moisture from inside the flasher unit taking care not to disturb the
        commutator finger contacts. Lubricate the motor bearings according to directions in the technical
        manual for the equipment.
        3.21.2.4. Open junction boxes suspected of water contamination. Clean and reinsulate any
        exposed wire connections as necessary. Clear drainage holes or breather pipes of the conduit sys-
        tem. When not present, drill small diameter holes (#50 drill) at low points in the conduit system to
        allow water to drain.

                                         INTERFACE POINTS

4.1. About This Chapter. To clarify the interface point between the maintenance responsibilities of Host
Support Organization and the AF ISR Agency organization, it is necessary to define an interface point for
each individual antenna system. This chapter defines interface points and establishes those parts of the
structure carried on real-property records. This chapter should be incorporated in the ISA by reference
and the real property components identified in the Host Support Organization Real Property Records. The
interface points identified in this chapter are for accountability of real property. Normally the maintenance
interface point is the same point, however the maintenance interface point may be locally negotiated
between the AF ISR Agency Unit and the Host Support Organization. Any locally negotiated deviation
from the recommended maintenance interface point shall be documented in the AF ISR Agency Unit ISA
or by Memo of Agreement (MOA).

                                      INSPECTION CHECKLISTS

A2.1. Inspecting antenna support structures. The task of inspecting antenna support structures is a
tedious and time-consuming job. Brief checklists have been developed to aid the inspection team to pre-
vent repetition, to provide uniformity, and to expedite the work. The checklists have been broken into two
groups:
     A2.1.1. Checklists covering the AN/FLR-9 grouped by bands.
     A2.1.2. Checklists covering all other antenna support structures.

A2.2. Maintenance Checklist for AN/FLR-9
     A2.2.1. Band A Support Structure:
        A2.2.1.1. Inspect louvered screen door at base of element and screening between top of sleeve
        and bottom of weather cap for any damage, obstruction to ventilation, or loss of attachment.
            A2.2.1.1.1. Recommend removal of any obstruction to air ventilation; such as dust, air, or
            insects.
            A2.2.1.1.2. If insect screen is detached from either element sleeve or weather cap, sand or
            scrape off all loose adhesives (Military Specification MIL-S-4383) from sleeve or weather
            cap. Clean and dry the area. Apply a thin layer of adhesive to area where screen is to be reb-
            onded. Press screen back into place, and apply another thin layer of adhesive to screen.
            A2.2.1.1.3. If insect screen has a minor hole or crack, sand, clean, and dry the surface in vicin-
            ity of hole or crack. Apply paste (Type C-X701, with Cream Hardener 107, Curtis Inc.,
            Worcester, Massachusetts (or equivalent)) over hole or crack.
        A2.2.1.2. Inspect weather cap for evidence of leaks. If weather cap becomes porous after long
        exposure to severe weather conditions, sand, clean, and coat outside surface with nonmetallic base
        radome paint (Laminar X-500 Standard, Type A, white 9-W-1, Magna Coating and Chemical
        Corp., Los Angeles, California (or equivalent)).
        A2.2.1.3. Inspect wooden members for deterioration, cuts, and holes. Treat cuts or holes with 5
        percent solution of pentachlorophenol (Federal Specification TT-W-571C). Apply solution by
        brushing or spraying.
        A2.2.1.4. Inspect steel surfaces for rust. If rust appears, wirebrush surface and apply two coats of
        zinc paint (Military Specification MIL-P-26915).
        A2.2.1.5. Check vertical alignment of support structure. Sight edge of sleeve 1 foot from top and
        1 foot from footing. Maximum error in alignment is one part in three thousand. Check in two
        directions, 90 degrees apart. Adjust the leveling nuts and steel wedge shims to correct vertical
        alignment.
        A2.2.1.6. Check the condition of concrete foundation and check for settlement. Establish control
        points for each footing for antennas and maintain a permanent record of settlement. Settlement of
        1/2 inch or less is acceptable.
AFISRAI32-1001 11 JANUARY 2008                                                                         37

     tighten, or replace conductors as necessary.
  A2.2.2. Band B Support Structure:
     A2.2.2.1. Inspect louvered screen access panels near top and bottom of antenna element sleeve.
     Remove any obstruction to air ventilation; such as, dirt, dust, insects, bird nests, or plant growth.
     A2.2.2.2. Inspect rubber seal at top of weather cap for deterioration. Replace as necessary.
     A2.2.2.3. Check the surface of weather cap to ensure that it is still weather resistant.
         A2.2.2.3.1. If weather cap has become porous; sand, clean, and coat outside surface with non-
         metallic base radome paint (Laminar, X-500 Standard, Type A, White 9-W-1, Magna Coating
         and Chemical Corp., Los Angeles, California (or equivalent)).
         A2.2.2.3.2. If weather cap has a hole or crack, sand, clean, and dry the area in vicinity of hole
         or crack. Apply paste (type C-X701, Curtis Inc., Worcester, Massachusetts (or equivalent))
         over hole or crack.
     A2.2.2.4. Inspect steel surface for rust. If rust appears, wire brush the surface and apply one coat
     of zinc paint (TT-P-641).
     A2.2.2.5. Check connections of grounding conductors and continuity of grounding system. Clean,
     tighten, or replace conductors as necessary.
     A2.2.2.6. Check the condition of concrete foundation and check for settlement. Establish control
     points for each footing and maintain a permanent record of settlement. Settlement of 1/2 inch or
     less is acceptable.
     A2.2.2.7. Check vertical alignment of support structure. Sight edge of sleeve 1 foot from top and
     1 foot from footing. Maximum error in alignment is one part in one thousand. Check in two direc-
     tions, 90 degrees apart. Use steel wedge shims to adjust vertical alignment.
  A2.2.3. Band C Support Structure:
     A2.2.3.1. Inspect antenna support structure for loose or damaged bolts. Tighten or replace as nec-
     essary.
     A2.2.3.2. Inspect support structure for physical deflection or warping.
     A2.2.3.3. Inspect/test the wooden members for deterioration, checks, splits, cuts, and holes.
     Splits, checks, cuts, and holes can adversely affect the structural strength of wooden members;
     therefore, the severity of any of these conditions should be determined be a Civil or Structural
     Engineer. If the Engineer determines that the wooden member is structurally sound, treat checks,
     splits, cuts, or holes with a 5 percent solution of pentachlorophenol (Federal Specification
     TT-W-571C). Apply solution by brushing or spraying. Accomplish repairs IAW recommendations
     of the Engineer or request guidance from AF ISR AGENCY/LG/XPC.
     A2.2.3.4. Inspect steel surfaces for rust. If rust is detected, wirebrush and clean the affected area
     and apply one coat of zinc paint (Military Specification MIL-P-26915).
     A2.2.3.5. Check compressed length of springs of horizontal wires. Adjust so that compressed
     length is 1 inch. Since adjustment of one spring will affect the others in the same bay, each should
     be measured after initial adjustment of all springs in that bay.
38                                                                 AFISRAI32-1001 11 JANUARY 2008


        A2.2.3.6. Check condition of concrete foundation. Repair minor cracks and spalls. Also, check
        for settlement.
        A2.2.3.7. Check conditions of lightning rods, grounding conductors, and continuity of grounding
        system. Replace lightning rods, grounding conductors as required. Clean, tighten, or replace con-
        nections as necessary.
     A2.2.4. A/B Band Reflecting Screen:
        A2.2.4.1. Inspect the bottom (horizontal) wooden beam from underneath. Remove undergrowth
        as required.
        A2.2.4.2. Inspect primary support tower and reflecting screen support structures for loose or dam-
        aged bolts. Tighten as necessary, (Torque for high strength A325 bolts is 320 pounds-feet).
        A2.2.4.3. Inspect steel surfaces for rust. If rust is detected, wire brush and clean affected area and
        apply one coat of zinc paint (TT-P-641).
        A2.2.4.4. Inspect/test the wooden members for deterioration, checks, splits, cuts, and holes.
        Splits, checks, cuts, and holes can adversely affect the structural strength of wooden members;
        therefore, the severity of any of these conditions should be determined by a Civil or Structural
        Engineer. If the Engineer determines that the wooden member is structurally sound, treat cuts or
        holes with a 5 percent solution of pentachlorophenol (Federal Specification TT-W-571C). Apply
        solution by brushing or spraying.
        A2.2.4.5. Inspect support structure for physical deflection or warping.
        A2.2.4.6. Check compressed length of springs an vertical wires (should be 4 3/8 inches for 9 to 30
        pounds springs or 3 3/8 inches for newer 150-pound stainless-steel springs). Check compressed
        length of all springs after initial adjustment since adjustment of one spring will affect the length of
        the others.
        A2.2.4.7. Check condition of concrete foundation. Repair minor cracks and spalls. Also, check
        for settlement.
