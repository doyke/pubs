                                        ATTACHMENT

Guidance Changes to Management of Records

The below changes to AFMAN 33-363, dated 1 May 2008, are effective immediately.

(Replace) 1.3. Record Maintenance Technologies. Records are the information that we preserve
and manage. Technology has revolutionized the flow of communication and significantly
contributed to the challenges of managing records in media other than paper. Various automated
systems already store information as records. Conversion of paper documents to electronic
format such as microform, optical disk, video disk, compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk
(DVD), as well as scanning documents to a portable document format (PDF) are acceptable.
Electronic records are the media of choice for use, storage and maintenance. Create new paper
records only after receiving approval by the Air Force Record Officer (AFRO). Requests must
include justification compliant with the exemptions specified in the Government Paperwork
Reduction Act, Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA), E-Government Initiatives; and
DoD and Air Force Net-Centric Strategies. Existing paper records may be destroyed after
scanning to an approved format and validating content, or inputting information in an electronic
record keeping system (ERKS). A concerted effort should be made to reduce paper storage
across the Enterprise. Chapter 2 and Chapter 6 provide guidance on using AFRIMS to manage
all records, and the structure of records to transition to the Air Force EIM Solution.

(Replace) 2.4.3.1. Record Retention Media. To better facilitate the use of storage area networks
(SAN), inactive e-records may be transferred to offsite storage (platters, disks, CDs, etc.) until
ready for disposal or accession to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
Inactive e-records transferred to offsite storage must be reviewed annually to ensure proper
disposition, viability of the media, and accessibility of the content. Laptops and thumb drives are
NOT approved for long-term record storage. Records created on laptops and or thumb drives
must be transferred to SAN or EIM storage as soon as possible. Deployed personnel will follow
procedures established at the deployed location. Record storage is based on the available storage
media, need and frequency information is retrieved, formats commonly used to display the
content to give the most value to users, and any restrictions associated with corresponding
retention rules in the records disposition schedule (RDS). Relative costs of storage and
preservation, convenience of use and ease with which hard-copy documents can be regenerated
from the machine-readable files may also impact the medium of choice used for archival
purposes when information exists in multiple formats. After conversion from non-electronic to
electronic media, following a thorough quality review, original paper records with a temporary
disposition may be destroyed. Before conversion of paper records with a permanent disposition
contact the Air Force Records Office for approval and guidance.

(Replace) 6.1.1.2.6.1. Records Professionals, including Records Custodians (RCs), Functional
Area Records Managers (FARMs), Base Records Managers (BRMs), Major Command Records
Managers (CRMs), Agency Records Managers (ARMs), and Chiefs of Office of Records
(CORs) will receive annual role-based training. Validation of training completion for all Records
Professionals involved in the chain of custody is required when reporting lost or damaged
records; reference AFI 33-364, Records Disposition – Procedures and Responsibilities. All AF
AFMAN33-363_AFGM2014-01                                                               3

users will receive annual records management training. Additional guidance will be provided to
those users involved in conducting, reporting, preserving and producing materials associated
with a discovery/litigation hold request.

(Added) Chapter 7 Discovery/Litigation Hold Process

(Added) 7.1. All information created or received while carrying out the Air Force mission is
subject to discovery under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures (FRCP). As such, the AF must
establish standard procedures for conducting searches, collecting and preserving relevant
information, and reporting results.

(Added) 7.2. Responsibilities for conducting searches, collecting and preserving relevant
information, and reporting results are shared among the Records Professionals, the Air Force
Records Office (AFRO), and Records Holders (RHs) within identified organizations. Additional
guidance is contained in AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation. AFSPC will execute AF Network searches
as tasked based on the criteria in the litigation hold memo using established standardized
procedures.

(Added) 7.3. Training is an important element in ensuring AF members use standardized
procedures in gathering discoverable information and reporting search results. AFRO will
provide annual role based training for Records Professionals that includes procedures for
conducting searches, collecting and preserving relevant information, and reporting results. RCs
will provide guidance to RHs on procedures to search assigned respective workspaces and their
assigned desktop/laptop computers for potentially relevant information.

(Added) 7.4. As a standard, the AF will complete searches for potentially relevant information
and report the search results within the time prescribed in the Litigation Hold memo. The AFRO
will track search results and report status to the Managing Attorney. The AFRO, with support of
the CRM/ARM, will track overdue responses using the Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) and report results on a monthly basis.

(Added) 7.5. The AFRO will use AFRIMS to distribute search requests and litigation holds for
paper and non-AF network ESI (including emails and file shares) to Records Professionals,
submit search findings, track results, and generate summary report of responses. Separate
notification external to AFRIMS will be sent to DISA for Defense Enterprise Email (DEE)
searches.

(Added) 7.6. Each Records Professional shall certify that he/she received, read, understood,
and fully complied with search and preservation instructions and requirements through his/her
responses in AFRIMS.


(Replace) Attachment 6 Search Request and Litigation Hold Procedures

(Added) A6.1.1. The discovery/litigation hold process will be initiated by the Managing
Attorney through the issuance of a Search Request and Litigation Hold. The Search Request and
Litigation Hold will be distributed to the AFRO, servicing legal office, and/or directly to
individuals, units, or organizations.

(Added) A6.1.2. The AFRO shall serve as the Office of Primary Responsibility for the
management and oversight of the Search Request and Litigation Hold process.

(Added) A6.1.2.1. The AFRO will review the Search Request and Litigation Hold and work
with the Managing Attorney to assist in the identification of additional search terms and/or
organizations to be tasked as required.

(Added) A6.1.2.2. The AFRO will enter the search request into AFRIMS, identifying each
MAJCOM/FOA/DRU, Base, Unit, or Organization having potentially relevant information. The
search terms and any unique procedural requirements will be provided in the records search
details in AFRIMS. Search requests that are classified, contain controlled unclassified
information, or that require sensitive handling will be processed external to AFRIMS. The search
will include all Air Force information in any medium, to include electronically stored
information within tasked offices of record, individual government desktops/laptops or external
hard drives, within their active and inactive records, and in base staging or offsite at a Federal
Records Center.

(Added) A6.1.3. Within given authorities for AF networks, AFSPC will direct the execution of
AF network searches for all AF networks ESI of the pertinent organizations or individuals, based
on search terms and criteria defined in Litigation Hold requests.

(Added) A6.1.4. As part of executing the search for all AF networks ESI, AFSPC will ensure
network search activities provide an audit trail with search results that captures the following:
office symbol; name and contact information of person(s) conducting the search; date search
conducted; methodology and/or search terms used (i.e., physical process, search software/
program and specific search terms used); findings comments (if any); and an indication whether
information was located as a result of the search (yes or no). If a search of file shares results in
findings, the audit trail shall identify the findings by format of ESI (ex. Word Document, Excel
Spreadsheet); location of ESI (ex. SHARE_NAME, \\Server_name, Drive Letter:); and total data
size/number of findings. If a search of email results in findings, the audit trail shall identify
findings by custodian of information and total data size/number of findings. Information found
shall be copied in such a manner as to not modify metadata or original information and placed in
the designated Litigation Hold Site along with complete record of audit trail.

(Added) A6.1.5. The CRM/ARM will manage the Litigation Hold Site established to hold
potentially relevant findings and related audit trail information for each search. The CRM/ARM
shall establish a folder in the Litigation Hold Site with the unique title and ID number for each
search as listed in AFRIMS. AFRO, CRM/ARM and designated AFLOA personnel will have
full permissions to the Litigation Hold Site. BRM and lead network search personnel will have
contribute rights only. The CRM/ARM shall grant Managing Attorneys access to specific folders
by request as necessary.
AFMAN33-363_AFGM2014-01                                                                    5



(Added) A6.1.5.1. The Litigation Hold Site shall not be subject to any automatic overwriting,
archiving, or deletion procedures. The CRM/ARM shall notify network technicians conducting
any equipment or software upgrades or patches of the Litigation Hold Site and verify that such
maintenance will not alter the native file format and will minimize any changes to metadata.
System-wide updates that affect overall efficiency and operations of AF systems are not to be
avoided because of Litigation Holds, but reasonable efforts should be made to mitigate their
effect on information that is subject to a Litigation Holds (e.g. first remove the information to a
portable hard drive.)

(Added) A6.1.5.2. The CRM/ARM will monitor all searches and upon final reporting by tasked
search activities shall report all findings and an audit trail for submission to the AFRO.

(Added) A6.1.6. The CRM/ARM will close out the search in AFRIMS after all tasked Records
Professionals for assigned MAJCOM, Base, Unit, or Organization have completed reporting in
AFRIMS. The AFRO will provide a summary report of the search results and access to all
findings to the Managing Attorney in accordance with instructions in AFRIMS, and provide
further reports and information as necessary.

(Added) A6.1.7. The AFRO will provide the Managing Attorney with all information
necessary to validate the Air Force search, preservation, and collection processes.

(Added) A6.1.8. Tasked records professionals are responsible for initiating a thorough search
of all paper, non-electronic (e.g., microfiche), and ESI within their area of responsibility to
include official records in file plans, active and inactive records, external electronic media,
desktops/laptops, and any other information systems used by the organization to process records
and identified on the file plan, to include those transferred for short and long term storage in base
staging or offsite at a Federal Records Center (FRC) which the Records Professionals reasonably
expects to contain information responsive to the search request and Litigation Hold. Tasked
Records Professionals are responsible for notifying all organizational personnel of the Litigation
Hold and search request and ensure all personnel provide appropriate responses. The tasked
Records Professionals, along with the Knowledge Operators, shall assist organizational
personnel with conducting searches of and properly preserving information, including ESI.

(Added) A6.1.8.1. Tasked records professionals are required to acknowledge receipt of each
tasked information search. Marking the acknowledgement box in AFRIMS establishes the
records professional has read the search details and any unique procedural requirements.

(Added) A6.1.8.2. Tasked records professionals are required to certify the actions taken to meet
requirements of tasked information searches. After completing the search and responding to all
mandatory fields in AFRIMS to include: the name of any document/file/ESI located as result of

                              OBJECTIVES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Record Management Basics. Records are created by military, civilian, and contractor Air Force
employees. Record types include Draft records--those that can be altered and have not been signed or
officially released; and Final records--those that have been signed, officially released and cannot be
altered. Air Force employees have three basic obligations regarding records: (1) Create records needed to
do the business of the agency, reflect record decisions and actions taken, and/or document activities for
which they are responsible; (2) manage records by setting up directories and files, and filing materials (in
any format) regularly and carefully in a manner that allows safe storage and efficient retrieval when nec-
essary; and (3) ensure records are maintained in accordance with this manual, and disposed of in accor-
dance with the AFRIMS RDS (located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/rds_series.cfm) and related Federal
regulations and legal requirements. This manual outlines the principles of applying electronic records
(e-records) management (ERM) by using existing resources and prepares your organization for transition
to an Enterprise Information Management (EIM) tool suite; provides standards for preserving, protecting
and disposing of Air Force records in/on electronic media or any other media and incorporating those
standards into each life cycle phase of the record. Records are media neutral and include all information
that can document business performance or transactions; was made or received in the performance of
duties; and could affect or impact a process, program, decision, etc.

1.2. Duties and Responsibilities. Refer to AFI 33-322, Records Management Program.

1.3. Record Maintenance Technologies. Records are the information that we preserve and manage.
Technology has revolutionized the flow of communication and significantly contributed to the challenges
of managing records in media other than paper. Various automated systems already store information as
records. Conversion of paper documents to electronic format such as microform, optical disk, video disk,
compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD), as well as scanning documents to a portable document
format (PDF) are acceptable. Electronic records are the media of choice for use, storage and maintenance.
Create new paper records after receiving approval by the Air Force Record Officer (AFRO). Requests
must include justification compliant with the exemptions specified in the Government Paperwork Reduc-
tion Act, Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA), E-Government Initiatives; and DoD and Air
Force Net-Centric Strategies. Existing paper records may be destroyed after scanning to an approved for-
mat and validating content, or imputing information in an electronic record keeping system (ERKS). A
concerted effort should be made to reduce paper storage across the Enterprise. Chapter 2 and Chapter 6
provide guidance on using AFRIMS to manage all records, and the structure of records to transition to the
Air Force EIM Solution.

        AIR FORCE RECORDS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (AFRIMS)

2.1. Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). AFRIMS is the mandatory,
unclassified, web-based tool suite, Government-Owned Technology Software designed to enhance and
standardize Air Force records management and procedures. The RDS, maintained in AFRIMS, is the
authoritative source for record dispositions. To ensure legal compliance and data integrity, the RDS
will not be supplemented, duplicated, or exported from AFRIMS. Records professionals use
AFRIMS to prepare file plans and associated record products; track training, staff assistance visits (SAV),
and staging area data. Air Force personnel (military, civilian, and contractor), personnel at .gov addresses,
and the public may view the RDS via the Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network/Internet at https:/
/afrims.amc.af.mil/rds_series.cfm; via the Air Force Portal under “Application A-Z Listing”); via the
Air Force e-Publishing website; and on the Air Force Link at http://www.af.mil/ Viewing the RDS
requires no password or user identification and no additional hardware or software to be installed.
    2.1.1. AFRIMS Accounts. User accounts are created using the Air Force Portal identification (ID) as
    the user’s AFRIMS ID. Record Custodians (RC) accounts are created by the Functional Area Records
    Manager (FARM). FARM accounts are created by the local Base Records Manager (BRM). Accounts
    for record professionals in tenant units are created by the host BRM with oversight by the unit major
    command (MAJCOM), field operating agency (FOA), or direct reporting unit (DRU) Records Man-
    ager (RM). Deployed record professional accounts are established through the BRM or AFRIMS help
    desk DSN 779-6771. MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU accounts are created by the AFRO. This hierarchical
    schema enables oversight of AFRIMS data across the Air Force.
    2.1.2. Security. File plan titles will not contain sensitive, classified, For Official Use Only (FOUO), or
    Privacy Act information. File plans replicated on shared drives and in the EIM solution containing
    folder with sensitive or classified (on approved network media SECRET Internet Protocol Router
    Network (SIPRNET) according DOD 5200.1-R) information/records must include the highest mark-
    ing in the folder title. Restrict access to users with authority (to include clearance) and a need to view.
    Primary folder titles align with the file plan title; sub-folders are unnumbered to allow project naming
    and alphabetical sorting by the action officers and are not reflected on the file plan. Sub-folders will
    contain only the record types described in the table and rule of the primary folder. Segregation of
    records by disposition is required by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
    2.1.3. Description. AFRIMS automates records management functions and provides abbreviated,
    on-line, up-to-date access to the RDS. Additionally, AFRIMS streamlines file plan development,
    update and approval; creates disposition control and folder labels, tracks SAVs and record profes-
    sional appointments, contact information and training; orchestrates the freezing/unfreezing of records;
    facilitates staging area management; and streamlines record transfer and staging. The AFRO is the
    AFRIMS program manager and update authority.

2.2. Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) File Procedures. U s e                   the
“location” field of the file plan to show where documents are filed. Subdivisions (project folders) are not
required to be added in AFRIMS. Contact the organization’s Record Professional (RP) for additional

   2.2.1. Files Maintenance and Disposition Plan. Upon completion or update of the file information into
   AFRIMS, the system notifies the file plan approval point via electronic mail (E-mail) that the file plan
   is ready for review. File plans must be coordinated through the Chief of the Office of Record (COR),
   FARM and BRM in turn. FARMS that have approval authority must ensure that the BRM has access
   to view the file plans. The approver reviews and approves or offers suggestions for changes. The file
   plan is considered official after it has been accepted, and signed by COR. The file plan coordination
   and approval process can be performed electronically through the transmission of the file plan via dig-
   itally signed E-mails among the RC, FARM, COR, and the BRM.
       2.2.1.1. File Plan Review. Record custodians will conduct a systematic review of file plans
       (weekly at a minimum) is required. RDS restructuring changes cause file plans to become unap-
       proved. When a file plan is disapproved as a result of format changes, file plan approval process
       can be expedited by advising your approval point of contact that the disapproval was a result of
       format changes in the RDS, not changes in the unit’s record collections. Include a report from
       AFRIMS of the rule changes. You are not required to update for personnel changes.
   2.2.2. File Disposition Control Label for Non-Electronic Media. AFRIMS generates file disposition
   control labels. Use one disposition authority (table and rule) per record series or entry on the file plan.
   2.2.3. Folder Labels for Non-Electronic Media. AFRIMS allows printing of folder labels for file plan
   items, each office or all offices of record, or specific tables and rules. Manually mark folders contain-
   ing classified records with the highest classification of the contents. Use folders for each record series
   listed on the file plan and maintained in file cabinets. Records maintained outside the file cabinets, in
   binders, card file boxes or posted on the wall do not need a folder. Place the disposition control label
   on the guide cards or containers of physical media.
   2.2.4. Filing Classified Records. Follow the procedures in paragraph 4.3.

2.3. File Cut-off Procedures. Cut-off files as indicated in paragraph 4.4. Destroy, transfer, or retire eligi-
ble records according to the latest cut-off instructions on the AFRIMS disposition control label.

2.4. Electronic and Other Non-Paper Records and Record Objects. Indicate location and medium of
both electronic and physical files on the file plan.
   2.4.1. E-Records Creation. Current technology allows administrative, technical, and professional per-
   sonnel to create, store, share and revise the documents more easily than in the traditional paper-based
   office operation. It is essential to note that draft records can be altered and final records cannot be
   altered.
   2.4.2. All information created in or received while carrying out the Air Force missions is categorized
   as a record. How long the record is needed to facilitate the work and the degree to which it must be
   controlled is an attribute of its value to the mission or the agency, legal requirements, and its unique-
   ness. Some products of traditional office work created on a microcomputer (e.g., letters, memoran-
   dums, reports, etc.) may have no value after the product is filed and other records such as the master
   files for the Air Force Document Storage and Retrieval System, Action Tracking System, Comptroller
   Automated Budget System, or International Negotiation System are most valuable as computer files
   and should be converted to physical media only by exception such as the response to a data call that
   cannot be completed using computer files.
8                                                                       AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008


    2.4.3. Electronic Record Keeping (ERK) Concept. Electronic technology has greatly increased the
    methods of creating, editing, maintaining, transmitting, and retrieving Air Force records. During the
    information life cycle (creation through disposition) record value often extends beyond the traditional
    paper form to comprise a variety of media. The ERK concept requires a system that accepts, pre-
    serves, and makes accessible—into the future—any type of electronic document. Moreover, it must
    ensure access regardless of hardware and software used to create the document. This concept requires
    a climate of urgency, since there are an unprecedented number of e-records being created daily and
    preservation time and need to view/access may change many times prior to life cycle completion.
       2.4.3.1. Record Retention Media. To better facilitate the use of storage area networks (SAN),
       in-active e-records may be transferred to off-site storage (platters, disks, CDs, etc.) until ready for
       disposal or accession to National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Laptops and
       thumb drives are NOT approved for long-term record storage. Records created on laptops and or
       thumb drives must be transferred to SAN or EIM storage as soon as possible. Deployed personnel
       will follow procedures established at the location or as directed by the USCENTAF Records Man-
       agement Program Office. Record storage is based on the available storage media, need and fre-
       quency information is retrieved, formats commonly used to display the content to give the most
       value to users, and any restrictions associated with corresponding retention rules in the RDS. Rel-
       ative costs of storage and preservation, convenience of use and ease with which hard-copy docu-
       ments can be regenerated from the machine-readable files may also impact the medium of choice
       used for archival purposes when information exists in multiple formats. After conversion from
       non-electronic to electronic media, original paper records may be destroyed.
       2.4.3.2. Transition to Electronic Records Management (ERM). The contents of the computer’s
       directory or the sum of all electronic folders may be equated to the traditional file drawer. Each
       computer data subdirectory or electronic folder is equivalent to a paper file folder. Files in directo-
       ries or folders are equivalent to individual documents in the physical folders. Directory or folder
       names are equivalent to file folder labels to identify the broad functional category of the informa-
       tion contained in them. Primary folder names contain filing instructions. Labeling, naming, and
       filing conventions for e-records should be simple. Promotion of an effective electronic filing sys-
       tem will be enhanced by like documents in the same place (on the same labeled diskette or in the
       same directory on a hard drive) to avoid the necessity of rummaging through a drawer full of dis-
       kettes or searching through multiple directories on hard drives to find needed documents.
       2.4.3.3. Labeling Electronic Records (E-Records) or File Naming Conventions. Labels are essen-
       tial to the accessibility of electronic media. Each document in electronic form must be identified
       sufficiently to enable authorized personnel to retrieve, protect, and carry out its disposition. Label-
       ing e-records is accomplished at two levels: external and internal.
           2.4.3.3.1. External or Physical Labeling. External labeling includes physically placing labels
           on e-record containers such as diskettes, disk jackets and magnetic tape containers, as well as
           on the individual diskettes and tapes. Place the disposition control label on the guide cards or
           on containers for compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM), diskettes, cassettes, tapes, or
           other electronic media.
           2.4.3.3.2. Electronic Record (E-Records) Backup. Labels should show the same information
           required on paper file folder labels as well as the hardware (computer equipment) and software
           (computer program) that will read the information. External labels on e-records will include
           the following on the diskette container/jacket: security classification, disposition instructions
AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008                                                                                 9


          (table and rule from the RDS), originating office symbol, title of record, begin and end dates,
          software used to create the record, and hardware used to produce the record. Labels should be
          written on or typed before being affixed to prevent damage to the medium when physically
          affixing labels to individual diskettes and tapes. Never erase information on a label once it is
          in place. Choose an area away from all holes when affixing a label to a disk.
          2.4.3.3.3. Internal or Electronic Labeling. Internal labeling consists of document and file nam-
          ing within the computer system. Naming electronic files resembles labeling paper file folders
          with two important differences. Most computer operating systems limit the length of a file
          name. Some limit the name to a total of 11 characters (8 for a name and 3 for an extension);
          others permit 25 to 30 characters, allowing more description. Conventions for file naming are
          not currently standardized. Electronic document naming conventions should be readily under-
          standable so that employees, their colleagues, and/or successors can find and use information
          stored in computer hard drives, on local networks, and on disks and CD-ROMs. Electronic
          labels located in subdirectories or folders must also provide sufficient information to find the
          files within them. For example, a subdirectory labeled 90101GA.1 might show General Office
          Administration files containing correspondence on arrangements for briefings, conferences,
          and tours that are destroyed after 1 year. Any logical combination of alphanumeric characters
          permitted by the operating system and descriptive of the series is suggested for naming subdi-
          rectories or folders, as exemplified in Figure 2.1. below.

Figure 2.1. Computer Directory Showing Office Subdirectories.




          2.4.3.3.4. Indexing and Retrieving Electronic Records (E-Records). The primary purpose of
          indexing e-records is to provide a rapid and reliable method for the automatic retrieval of
          user-selected sets of data. Indexing is critical when managing large holdings of records and
          required for all e-records with retention greater than five years. Use Database Management
          Systems (DMS), full text retrieval systems, or existing resources to create an index for retriev-
          ing electronically stored information.
             2.4.3.3.4.1. Create a master list of indexing terms with topics germane to your users.
             Update and cross-references each topic on the master list to direct users and future index-
             ers to more appropriate or related subject terms.

                                                 Chapter 3

                             PLANNING AND ARRANGING RECORDS

3.1. Office Arrangement. Arrange records to provide safe and easy access for workers and to protect
FOUO, sensitive, classified information and Privacy Act material.

3.2. Basic Filing Arrangement. When possible, separate records series for ease of filing and retrieving
without separate indexing systems. If warranted by the volume of records, subdivide a series for ease of
filing, but avoid setting up subdivisions that contain only a few records. Keep paper folders to one inch in
volume when possible and limit electronic files based on the assigned storage. Unless directives specify
filing procedures, use one of the following arrangements.
     3.2.1. Numerical. Use to identify or refer to paper files by number.
     3.2.2. Chronological. Use when files are in date sequence or when the date is the primary means of
     reference. Place record with the latest date on top.
     3.2.3. Geographical. Use to file records (e.g., state, country, or city) when the geographical arrange-
     ment is the primary means of reference.
     3.2.4. Organizational. Use when the name of the organization or level of command is the primary
     means of reference.
     3.2.5. Alphabetical. Preferred method for electronic files as alphabetical sequence sorts quicker and
     is much easier to locate than numerical files. File by name of project, person, company, base, unit,
     organization, etc. Disregard articles, conjunctions, and prepositions and omit numbers when filing
     alphabetically.
     3.2.6. Subjective (Project Files). Use when the subject is the primary means of reference. If a records
     series uses a subjective arrangement and subdivisions, the overall arrangement is subjective, even if
     you file the subdivision in chronological order.

3.3. General Correspondence File. Keep general correspondence files to a minimum. The RDS is very
detailed; most files fall under one of the tables and rules for disposition purposes.

3.4. Standardization. The BRM approves standardized file plans (formats) pertinent to base- or
unit-level. For an office below the base- or unit-level, the COR approves the file plan.

3.5. File Drawers. After preparing the file plan and files disposition control and folder labels, arrange
physical file drawers in the sequence shown on the file plan, aligning labels on the left side of the drawer.
Electronic files include file plan replication on the shared storage network. The parent folders of each
record category is named and aligned to replicate the file plan. Sub-folders are created as needed by the
action officers and named by project, process, or contract number rather than file number. Sub-folders of
electronic files are not placed on the file plan. Sub-folders only use alphabetical naming convention to
ease search and retrieval in the shared environment.
AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008                                                                                   11


3.6. Charge Out Records. Prepare and place an AF Form 614 or 614A, Charge Out Record, in place of
a record or folder removed from physical files. Allow “copies” of final electronic records to be used by
those authorized. Record copies, regardless of media, are destroyed when no longer needed.

3.7. Instructions for Using Guide Cards, Folders, and Labels.
   3.7.1. Disposition Guide Cards. Use a guide card with the disposition control label affixed to control
   each physical record series listed on the file plan. Place a disposition guide card in front of each series
   and in the same sequence shown on the file plan. Place the disposition control labels consistently
   throughout the file. Keep disposition guide cards with the active and inactive files as long as the files
   are kept in the current files area. Do not retire or discard disposition guide cards when retiring or
   destroying the records; reuse them if they are still in serviceable condition. When a disposition guide
   card cannot be placed in front of a records series, or when the records are kept away from the file
   drawer, place the disposition control label on the container, or on a card or sheet of paper in the con-
   tainer or binder, where they are conspicuous. Using a disposition guide card does not consistently
   work well with hanging files. Cut down the guide card and place it with a disposition control label in
   the hanging file.
   3.7.2. Locator Guide Cards. Affix a guide card with a label in any position to facilitate reference to
   the files. Use a locator guide card to support large volumes of records or to show a break of smaller
   subdivisions. If necessary, use locator guide cards in active and inactive files. Locator guide cards are
   custom and cannot be printed from AFRIMS.
   3.7.3. Folders. Use folders to group related paper records together. Use a folder for each record series
   or subdivision listed on the file plan when filed in a drawer. Do not use folders with notes, memos or
   hand-writing as it can confuse the record user. Transitory materials may be filed in one of four folders.
   Manually mark the folders containing classified records with the highest security classification of the
   contents.
   3.7.4. Folder Labels. Use AFRIMS-generated labels for each record series and subdivision listed on
   the file plan. Position labels to suit the need of the office; be consistent throughout the file and remove
   all memos and sticky notes. Place the folder labels on Kraft file folders in hanging files, not on the
   hanging file. Include the year, (calendar or fiscal) on the folder labels for records with a retention
   period of one year or longer. Using a pencil to mark the year will allow you to reuse folders and folder
   labels. Cut off transitory records monthly; do not put the year on the folder labels. Perpetual-type
   records that are cut off and disposed of after an event occurs, or when superseded, or no longer
   needed, do not require the year on the label. When the contents of the folders become too bulky for
   easy use, use as many folders as necessary. If so, label to show inclusive dates in each folder. Mark the
   folders containing classified records with the highest classification of the contents.
   Exception: Label folders that move with the individual on reassignment (clinical, field personnel
   records, flight records folders, or on-the-job training folders) according to the directive prescribing
   their use.
   3.7.5. Label for Locator Guide Cards. Type the item number and title of record series (or other key
   designator) on the label of the locator guide card to make it easier to locate specific records. Include
   the year, if needed, to distinguish between years in perpetual-type records.

     3.7.6. Drawer Labels. Include enough information on the drawer label to identify the records kept in
     the drawer. The words “ACTIVE” and “INACTIVE” may suffice for small files. When the files
     expand to more than one drawer, repeat the number on the drawer label.
AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008                                                                                13

                                FILING PROCEDURES RECORDS

4.1. Preparing Records for Filing.
   4.1.1. Mark Paper Records for Filing. Ensure all actions are complete and records are ready for filing
   by marking the upper right-hand corner of the document with the file code and proper official’s initials
   (Figure 4.1.). Use the item number of the separate series from the file plan, and, if needed, the letter
   or number of the subdivisions, a subject or enough identification to show where the record is to be
   filed. Documents that are obviously ready for filing as soon as you create or receive them do not
   require the file code or the official’s initials. Example: Suspense copies of a mail control form; mem-
   oranda for record prepared for file only; signed receipts for a classified document loaned or trans-
   ferred; document placed in library-type accumulations for reference use, such as reference copies of
   publications; copies of messages placed in message reference files; and historical research and refer-
   ence materials maintained by historians. A RC who maintains a high volume of records and spends a
   significant amount of time filing in a records series can submit a waiver request to the BRM from file
   coding Do not apply file codes to electronically stored records.

Figure 4.1. Document Showing Authorization and Code for Filing (Including Cross-Reference
Designation).




   4.1.2. Assemble Documents for Filing. Assemble documents for filing in the same manner as
   required for their creation, dispatch, and use with the latest action on top. Save the last E-mail
   response to capture an entire dialogue. Save E-mail attachments in their original format or convert to
14                                                                        AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008


     one of the approved formats (see paragraph 6.25.1.). Review the file and take necessary actions to get
     missing information in the file or make a notation to show what part of the file is missing or where it
     is filed if included in another folder. E-record pointers (hyperlinks) may be used as long as the record
     metadata reflects the retention of the longest record associated to the linked document. If a record
     requires a destruction certification, file a copy of the destruction certificate with the record or in the
     folder.

4.2. Cross References. Use DD Form 2861, Cross-Reference, when filing a physical record that involves
more than one records series. If copied, use the copies instead of the DD Form 2861. Mark the copies by
using “X” along side the appropriate file code and circling the appropriate file code in the upper
right-hand corner to show where the duplicate copies are filed (Figure 4.1.). Cross reference of e-records
may be accomplished in the metadata fields.

4.3. Filing Classified Records. Safeguard classified files according to DoD 5200.1-R, Information
Security Program; and AFPD 31-4, Information Security. File classified material separately, unless it is
necessary to maintain continuity of a particular transaction or event, or the volume of unclassified mate-
rial is too small to justify establishing separate files. If the unclassified records must be maintained with
the classified, protect according to its highest classification. Do not file extra copies of classified records
except to support the case file. Show the highest classification of records in the file on the folder tab (or
on the folder label, if space permits). Otherwise, keep label and file designations the same as the folders
containing unclassified material. Stamp the outside front and back of the file folder with the highest clas-
sification of the records filed in the folder. File classified records or other classified material in equipment
authorized for each classification or in a secure area or vault. Keep separate folders for classified and
unclassified records on the same subject. Place a DD Form 2861 in both folders. When adding a classified
record to a large unclassified file, substitute a cross-reference sheet for the classified record. Do not make
any classified entries on the cross-reference sheets.

4.4. Files Cut-off Procedures. The COR makes sure RCs review the files (both paper and electronic) at
least annually, cut off the files, and separate active from inactive records. Destroy, transfer, or retire eligi-
ble records according to instructions on the file disposition control label and the RDS, with the cut-off
date determined by the table and rule. For transferring records to one of NARA’s Federal Records Center,
complete a SF Form 135, Records Transmittal and Receipt per Attachment 2. The act of initiating the
transfer to NARA of records already scheduled as permanent is a scheduled offer, now called a scheduled
transfer. Exception: There are many record series for which a cut-off date is not proper, such as material
eligible for immediate destruction when superseded, obsolete, no longer needed, or similar circumstances.
Also, there are perpetual files that continue as active until the specific disposition occurs. Review these
files at least annually to determine status. Document the results of this review and file the results with the
file plan in file number 0-1.

4.5. File Plans for Deployed Units. File plans for deployed units should consist as a minimum of items
that cover maintenance and disposition, policy and precedent, delegations, general correspondence, office
administrative files, transitory, word processing files hard copy maintained in organized file, and presen-
tation in accordance with the RDS. Add additional items as mandated by the specific mission of the
deployed unit.

    5.2.2. Letter-Size and Legal-Size Folders. Use letter-size folders and guides when possible. Local
    supply activities may issue nonstandard filing supplies when standard supplies are not available and
    when an Air Force directive prescribes them (e.g., supervisor’s employee work folders, six-part jack-
    ets for aircraft maintenance records).

5.3. Suggested Standard Filing Equipment. Make sure all filing equipment, whether standard, non-
standard, or office system equipment is functionally compatible with the filing procedures in this manual.
Be sure equipment has file stops in order to use the guide cards and file folders, and the equipment has
drawer-labeling capability. The use of hanging files is authorized when office systems equipment is
approved. Use them as hanging “holders” rather than hanging folders, using a Kraft folder inside for filing
your records. Do not send hanging files when shipping records to staging area or records centers. Hanging

files are nonstandard filing supplies and can only be used as “holders” of the official file. Do not use them
in standard file cabinets or four- and five-drawer security safes that have file stops. If hanging files are
required, order them through supply channels. Consider used or reconditioned filing equipment as a suit-
able substitute for new filing equipment. Make excess filing equipment available to other offices within
an organization or turn it in for redistribution.

5.4. Shelf-Filing Equipment. Shelf-filing equipment, authorized in Allowance Standard 006, may be
more appropriate than filing cabinets for certain office needs. The seven-tier open-shelf file cabinet, with
or without doors, is standard equipment and is more economical. It also provides greater storage of
records per square foot than filing cabinets. Save-an-Aisle shelf files are authorized when justified by the
COR and approved by the BRM or Command Record Manager (CRM).

5.5. Procedures for Requesting and Controlling Filing Equipment and Nonstandard Filing Sup-
plies.
     5.5.1. Filing Cabinets. Use letter-size cabinets to the maximum extent practicable for letter-size mate-
     rial. Use legal-size cabinets when the majority of the filed material is legal-size or larger. Use key-lock
     cabinets only when directives require material to be kept under lock and key. Consult with the BRM
     when planning the use of powered or mechanized filing equipment. Do not contact the vendors’ rep-
     resentatives directly without approval of the BRM and the contracting office. After consultation with
     the BRM and after the COR concurs with the need for such equipment, send the request through the
     BRM for approval. Consider the following factors:
        5.5.1.1. The system for which the equipment is intended is well established and not likely to
        undergo changes that would eliminate the need for the equipment within the next five years.
        5.5.1.2. The location of the equipment is suitable. Ensure the records storage facility meets the
        conditions described in Attachment 3.
        5.5.1.3. The appropriate safety standards, physical features of the building and protection of clas-
        sified information.
     5.5.2. The COR reviews each request for nonstandard filing equipment or supplies and provides a
     recommendation for approval to the BRM, who approves or disapproves the request. Upon approval,
     the COR takes action to procure equipment.

                                               Chapter 6

              MANAGING ELECTRONICALLY STORED INFORMATION (ESI)

6.1. Objectives.
   6.1.1. The overall objectives of this chapter are to provide essential procedures to manage and protect
   electronically stored information (ESI) while protecting the integrity of e-records throughout their
   lifecycle. This chapter provides standards to ensure provisions for preserving, protecting, and dispos-
   ing of records on electronic media are made and incorporated into each phase of the information life-
   cycle and used to manage ESI throughout all phases. Amendments to Federal Record Center Program
   (FRCP) guidance are published to address issues associated with the preservation and production of
   all information in digital form, henceforth referred to in this manual as ESI. Attachment 4 provides
   the announcement of these changes to the Enterprise.
       6.1.1.1. Introduction of Electronic Records Management (ERM):
          6.1.1.1.1. Provides a method for ensuring ESI is available and protected to support business
          operations as well as meet statutory requirements to provide appropriate access throughout the
          ESI life-cycle.
          6.1.1.1.2. Provides guidance for maintaining and preserving ESI until the Air Force has a
          Records Management Application compliant with DoD 5015.02-STD, Electronic Records
          Management Software Applications Design Criteria Standard , and used across the Enterprise.
          6.1.1.1.3. Describes the minimum records management requirements based on, including but
          not limited to, the NARA policies, statutory requirements of Title 44 United States Code
          (USC) Sections 1901 and 3301, 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 1228, 1234, and
          1236, and the DoDD 5015.02 and standards.
          6.1.1.1.4. Assists Records Professionals (RPs) and Action Officers by providing a standard
          ERM solution to the Enterprise, reminds commanders and agency directorates that they are
          responsible for enforcing and monitoring compliance with legal, DoD and Air Force policies,
          imposing ERM controls on all ESI in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition
          Schedule (RDS).
       6.1.1.2. ERM requirements:
          6.1.1.2.1. Paper records will co-exist with e-records; however, after 1 September 2007, paper
          will be limited to those occasions when electronic media cannot be accepted in accordance
          with the E-Government (E-Gov) Act, GPEA, and the President’s Management Agenda.
          6.1.1.2.2. The integrity of ESI must be maintained throughout the life-cycle of final records.
          Read-only access rights are provided to personnel who have a need-to-know as determined by
          the appropriate authority when the ESI contains Privacy Act or other sensitive data.
          6.1.1.2.3. Fundamental records management rules are media neutral and apply to all ESI.
          6.1.1.2.4. System security is a records maintenance requirement.
          6.1.1.2.5. Computer resources (hardware and software) are available to effectively and effi-
          ciently manage ESI.
18                                                                 AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008


        6.1.1.2.6. Users have a basic working knowledge of computer technology (e.g., Microsoft
        Windows and Office) and records management.
            6.1.1.2.6.1. Users will receive annual records management training. Record professionals
            include FARMs, CORs, and RCs will receive intermediate records management training;
            CRMs and BRMs will receive advanced records management training. CORs may waive
            records management training by providing a statement that they are capable of performing
            their duties without the current intermediate records management training. Use their state-
            ment date as the CORs training date in AFRIMS. A copy of the statement or COR training
            completion certificate must accompany each lost record report. The Air Force Record
            Officer / Program Manager (SAF/XCPPA) will establish training criteria and validate
            requirements annually.
        6.1.1.2.7. ERM compliance is mandatory.
        6.1.1.2.8. Users understand the FRCP definition of ESI has been expanded to include any type
        of information, draft and final records and non-record materials, relevant to an impending liti-
        gation. ESI includes any information stored in a medium from which it can be retrieved and
        examined. The most common sources of ESI are E-mail, working papers, drafts, duplicates,
        copies and contract records. Personal records stored on Enterprise assets may be subject to dis-
        covery.
        6.1.1.2.9. Users are aware that FRCP rules create an extremely broad description of what ESI
        must be disclosed, place a time limit for the disclosure, and institute a “good-faith” test for
        retention schedules. These new rules often require quick identification and preservation of
        e-records and a delayed response to an ESI request can be costly and compromise Air Force
        interests during litigation.
     6.1.1.3. ERM benefits. Air Force organizations will realize many benefits from managing official
     e-records, such as, according to a Coopers & Lybrand study, faster retrieval of information,
     reduced physical record storage space and paper holdings, and increased productivity (e.g., on
     average each organization/person spends $280 recreating each “lost” document and spends $120
     searching for each misfiled document).
     6.1.1.4. ERM requires participation and cooperation of various functional owners with respect to
     technologies and policies.
        6.1.1.4.1. Managing e-records on a Shared Network Drive. This involves the participation of
        the Network Control Center (NCC) staff, base/unit RPs, BRMs, FARMs, RCs and CORs.
        6.1.1.4.2. ERM Rules of Engagement:
            6.1.1.4.2.1. RCs create office file plans using the tools in the AFRIMS located at https://
            afrims.amc.af.mil.rds_series.cfm. The location of e-records must be included in file
            plans.
            6.1.1.4.2.2. CORs are responsible for the physical and legal custody of records created or
            received by the office, regardless of media. This responsibility includes monitoring com-
            pliance of legal and regulatory requirements.
AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008                                                                           19


          6.1.1.4.2.3. Users creating and maintaining records have responsibilities to include com-
          pliance and filing. RCs ensure users are trained to understand and perform their responsi-
          bilities.
          6.1.1.4.2.4. Program managers must identify vital records needed to continue day-to-day
          operations without interruption or mission degradation after a disaster such as terrorist
          attack, hurricane, etc.
          6.1.1.4.2.5. Folder access is assigned to groups or individuals rather than documents.
          Access to final records is always limited to read-only. RPs are the only group authorized to
          delete records.
       6.1.1.4.3. Transferring ESI to a Shared Drive. ESI may be placed on several drives for ease of
       coordination or sharing. After the ESI is signed or approved the document becomes a final
       record and must be transferred to the shared drive designated for records to allow life-cycle
       management.
       6.1.1.4.4. System Back-Up. The NCC provides daily back-up of the dedicated electronic stor-
       age areas. Back-ups are used for record restoration when the system becomes corrupt or ESI is
       lost. Duplicate back-ups are made for vital records and maintained in geographically separate
       locations.
       6.1.1.4.5. ERM Responsibilities by Role:
          6.1.1.4.5.1. Users provide ESI descriptions to the RP.
          6.1.1.4.5.2. The RP develops File Plans to incorporate each ESI category, designate elec-
          tronic file (e-file) storage, and assign access.
          6.1.1.4.5.3. COR reviews and signs the Files Maintenance and Disposition Plan. The
          COR’s signature indicates the COR approves the record categories and validates vital
          record identification, disposition, and folder access. After the COR signs, file plans are
          work-flowed to the base approval authority.
          6.1.1.4.5.4. A FARM may be delegated as the file plan approval authority by the BRM.
          6.1.1.4.5.5. BRMs retain approval authority for file plans but may delegate this authority
          to trained FARMs, provide RM assistance to FARMs and base agencies (host and tenant),
          and provide training to FARMs/RCs and customers.
          6.1.1.4.5.6. MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU RMs ensure units (host and tenant) on each base
          are provided assistance to implement ERM and develop metrics to track implementation
          and compliance with RM requirements.
       6.1.1.4.6. Business Rules for e-files Management:
          6.1.1.4.6.1. AFRIMS file plan disposition and folder titles are replicated on the shared
          drive.
          6.1.1.4.6.2. Access is restricted on folders containing sensitive, Privacy Act data. Access
          is controlled by password and/or group permissions.
          6.1.1.4.6.3. E-mail attachments are saved and filed with the original E-mail.
20                                                              AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008


        6.1.1.4.6.4. Laws, policies and strategies to eliminate or reduce paper between Federal
        agencies are enforced to limit paper to meet historical and legal compliance.
        6.1.1.4.6.5. Document and folder names are kept short to prevent limitation of the
        Microsoft Windows operating system, Microsoft Office programs, and some CD/DVD
        burning (writing) software.
     6.1.1.4.7. Creating/Revising e-files Area. Each office of record uses an approved Files Main-
     tenance and Disposition Plan to store and manage their records. This plan must be created in
     AFRIMS and serves as the foundation for managing the storage area.
     6.1.1.4.8. E-Records Life-Cycle includes creating, filing, retrieval and use, transferring, and
     disposal.
     6.1.1.4.9. File e-records according to the Air Force Electronic Records Management (ERM)
     Solution Using Existing Resources guide located under Helpful Links in AFRIMS. The guide
     will also aid users determining record phase—draft or final. Draft records eligible for disposi-
     tion require maintenance even though they are works in progress.
     6.1.1.4.10. ESI retrieval is an important part of records management and is greatly enhanced
     by completing the record metadata (summary information) at the time of document creation.
     Microsoft applications have a summary information section (e.g., in Microsoft Word, click
     Tools, click Options, click Save tab, click to place a checkmark in the box in front of “Prompt
     for document properties”). Upon completion much of the metadata is completed by the com-
     puter.
     6.1.1.4.11. Transfer and Disposition. E-records are transferred from one place to another
     many times during their life. If you are not a RP, your transfers may be limited to transferring
     records from working or draft records to final records.
     6.1.1.4.12. E-Records Storage issues:
        6.1.1.4.12.1. Unprotected e-records are fragile and the risk of undetected alteration or
        tampering is greater than with paper. The ability to update, revise, or reuse electronic
        media makes the life-cycle brief and more complex than that of other record media. For
        these reasons, action officers (AO) must determine security safeguards, access, and dispo-
        sition as early as possible in the life-cycle of the record and the RP must ensure folder
        access to sensitive information is restricted to those with a need to view.
        6.1.1.4.12.2. The FARM, with support from the Client Support Administrator (CSA) and
        NCC staff creates “READ ONLY” e-file directories on the organization’s network drive/
        CD-ROM. The NCC and CSA share the responsibility for maintaining data integrity in
        these directories. FARMs must ensure access is limited to those with a need-to-know on
        records containing sensitive or Privacy Act information.
        6.1.1.4.12.3. The FARM, CSA and NCC staff form a partnership to promote and provide
        access to routine/non-sensitive records with a need-to-share strategy.
        6.1.1.4.12.4. The RCs, FARMs, CSAs, and NCC staff validate back-up procedures; mon-
        itor access to determine active and inactive records; move inactive records to off-line stor-
        age; and strategically plan for future storage needs.
AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008                                                                                 21


              6.1.1.4.12.5. The FARMs/RCs maintain the permissions for e-file users and assigning
              rights and permissions for users and folders. This important aspect is critical when acquir-
              ing dedicated storage for e-records and enabling records maintenance.
           6.1.1.4.13. Mapping to and disconnecting from a Shared Network is accomplished by the user
           who may obtain the specific location from the unit CSA or RP.
   6.1.2. E-records are the data that is read and processed by a machine and satisfy the legal definition of
   a record.
       6.1.2.1. Records are media neutral; document business performance or transactions; are made or
       received in the performance of duties; could affect or document policies, actions, or decisions; and
       relate to actions or information that has value.
       6.1.2.2. E-mail messages and database are common sources of e-records, even when the output is
       converted to paper.
       6.1.2.3. Automated Information Systems (AIS) create records and must be submitted for approval
       and scheduling (reference paragraph 6.2.).
       6.1.2.4. Electronic recordkeeping involves using a machine to create, store, retrieve, analyze,
       transfer and/or delete records.
   6.1.3. Scanned Documents. Paper records may be scanned into a NARA approved format, formats
   can be found at http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/initiatives/transfer-to-nara.html. Evalu-
   ate cost effectiveness prior to scanning, and perform 100% quality assurance evaluation (QAE) vali-
   dation prior to destruction of paper.

6.2. Life Cycle Management of E-Records. Until implementation of the Air Force Enterprise Informa-
tion Management Solution, ESI is maintained in accordance with the Air Force ERM Solution to ease
record transition into an Enterprise solution. ERK systems and AIS require approval by the AFRO to meet
the requirements levied by Congress via Information Technology Management Reform Act (ITMRA, also
referred to as the "Clinger-Cohen Act"), the Government Information Security Reform Act (GISRA),
Public Law (P.L. 106-398, October 30, 2000, reference P.L. 106-398, Subtitle G, Section 1061 (pp.
266-272)). IT systems are “Any telecommunications and/or computer-related equipment or intercon-
nected system or subsystems of equipment used in the acquisition, storage, manipulation, management,
movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of voice, and/or data,
including software, firmware, and hardware (this includes automated information systems) according to
Title 44 United States Code, Sections 3301, and 3303; 36 Code Federal Regulations, Sections 1228.26
and 1234.32.

6.3. Record Management Roles and Responsibilities. In addition to duties outlined in AFI 33-322,
Records Management Program, the Record professionals (RP) must protect record content and comply
with FOUO, sensitive, Privacy Act, and other policy and legal requirements.
   6.3.1. The AFRO is the Program Manager and the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for plan-
   ning, managing and facilitating the records management program and related policies. The AFRO is
   the approval/waiver authority for ERK systems within the Air Force containing long-term or perma-
   nent records. The system OPR prepares an AF Form 1341, Electronic Record Inventory (Figure 6.1.),
   the ERK Proposal, and an AF Form 525, Records Disposition Recommendation (Figure 6.2.) with
   decision logic table attached (Table 6.1. for submission through the BRM and CRM to the AFRO for
22                                                                 AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008


     approval. The AFRO then facilitates a system review by NARA staff to gain system approval and to
     have the system and its records scheduled in the RDS.

Figure 6.1. Sample AF Form 1341, Electronic Record Inventory.
AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008                                                                                   23


   6.3.2. The CRM at MAJCOM or the ARM at FOA, DRU, and affected unified and specified com-
   mands is the approval authority for proposals on ERK systems for AISs in their command for records
   kept less than 10 years. System OPRs prepare the AF Form 1341 and the ERK Proposal for submis-
   sion to the CRM or ARM as applicable.
       6.3.2.1. The CRM or Agency Records Manager (ARM) prepares actions on ERKS Proposals for
       Temporary Records. CRM bases approval on, at a minimum, disposition according to the RDS.
       The CRM provides copies of approved proposals to the Records Officer (RO) when requested.
       6.3.2.2. Establish Procedures to Comply with this Manual. The CRM gives advice and guidance
       to commanders and staff elements on ERKS as needed and periodically reviews electronic records
       systems to ensure they conform to requirements of the records management program as described
       in AFI 33-364.
   6.3.3. The BRM gives advice and guidance to commanders, CORs, and FARMs on the specifics of
   how to set up and maintain an ERK system; provides guidance on the records management program;
   and works with the functional systems administrators for the records server to ensure official records,
   to include E-mails and other e-records, are protected from unauthorized destruction and are backed up
   regularly, i.e., daily or weekly.
   6.3.4. The FARM assists the system OPR and RM in preparing proposals, in reviewing and evaluat-
   ing ERK proposals for AISs, and oversees the administration of the unit ERK system.
   6.3.5. The COR ensures all personnel maintain ESI according to the policy and legal requirements,
   provides guidance to the RC, and is ultimately the one accountable for the ESI created in their func-
   tional area.
   6.3.6. The ERK System OPR for any e-records maintained outside the Air Force ERM Solution (e.g.,
   those in locally-developed AISs) for which there is no Air Force disposition, prepares a separate ERK
   system proposal for each series of records and sends the proposal through appropriate channels to the
   Air Force RO for final NARA approval.
   6.3.7. The CSA work closely with the NCC and RM to ensure sufficient space is allocated for the
   storage of official e-records and to ensure appropriate permissions are established for records profes-
   sionals and users according to the Air Force ERM Solution.
   6.3.8. The NCC staff works closely with the BRM and CSA to maintain a central e-file repository for
   the installation and ensures the repository is backed up in case of catastrophic failure to facilitate suc-
   cessful disaster recovery.

6.4. Contractor Support. Government contractors who create or maintain Air Force e-records must
meet the requirements of this manual. The government OPR/Program Manager initiating outsourcing a
RM function includes these requirements in the Contract Statement of Work, Performance Work State-
ment, Statement of Need, etc. Contractor functions must submit an appointment letter identifying person-
nel to be trained to perform SAVs, utilize AFRIMS, etc. When no RP is assigned or identified, the
contractor quality assurance evaluator is responsible for all lifecycle record management and all duties
assigned to RP.

6.5. Electronic Record Keeping (ERK) Systems Solutions. Records in AIS and managed outside an
Air Force ERM Solution must be identified and managed by the system according to Department of
Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.2, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System and AFI 63-101, Oper-
24                                                                       AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008


ations Of Capabilities Based Acquisition System. The AIS OPR must determine the appropriate RDS rule
for each record and how long the records will remain in the system. Accountability and enforceability of
the record dispositions for system records are accomplished by scheduling the system with NARA
through the AFRO. Prepare AF Form 1341, Electronic Record Inventory, and the Electronic Recordkeep-
ing Proposal for submission through the BRM, CRM or ARM to the AFRO (AF.Records@penta-
gon.af.mil) for approval. Electronic record keeping systems must be DoD 5015.02-STD compliant and
have records management approval/coordination.

6.6. Documentation. The OPR must address the disposition of records in all life cycle phases and incor-
porate the documentation into applicable tables and rules of the RDS. The OPR keeps satisfactory infor-
mation to access, retrieve, and make changes to the records and up-to-date technical documentation for
each ERK that produces, uses, or stores data files.

6.7. Electronic Record Keeping (ERK) Decisions. The OPR must base decisions to initiate ERK on the
serviceability of the records, as determined under the appropriate records management instructions.
Records are serviceable if the system and filing procedures provide timely search and retrieval, and ease
of update with an adequate audit trail.

6.8. Vulnerability of Electronically Stored Information (ESI). Electronic records (e-records) and stor-
age systems require the careful management of procedures and equipment to ensure the continuing accu-
racy and availability of the information. Air Force 33-series publications contain requirements for
hardware and software management. An installation’s disaster plan must include a description of how
vital e-records are protected and recovered during any disaster according to AFI 33-364, and AFI
10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management Program Planning and Operations (formerly known as the
Full Spectrum Threat Response program). Each functional area must develop a Vital Records Plan or add
an appendix to the installations procedures. Refer to Attachment 5 for an example of the information
needed in a Vital Records Plan.

6.9. Maintaining and Preserving Electronically Stored Information (ESI). Changes in the FRCP
require access to drafts and records when responding to a record search as described in Attachment 6. To
better enable thorough searches, drafts and works in progress require shared storage/access and must be
included on the file plan. Exclude working papers, drafts, stenographic notes, tapes and disks that have
been transcribed; and charts, diagrams, or other graphic material used during briefings and data that is
summarized in final or other conclusion records. Accurate and complete external and internal labeling of
files and folders is essential to ensure identity and content of individual items, to retrieve information, and
to preserve the ESI from unintentional or intentional illegal destruction.
     6.9.1. External Labels for Diskettes, CDs and DVDs. The OPR must properly identify information in
     the document and on external storage labels. Identification should include the name of the organiza-
     tion, the table and rule from the RDS, a descriptive title for the contents, the dates of creation, and
     identification of hardware and software used. For permanent or unscheduled records, include the
     name of the organizational unit responsible for the data, system title, and security classification, if
     applicable. Additionally, maintain the following information for (but not necessarily attached to) each
     particular media used to store ESI: file titles; dates of creation; dates of coverage; the recording den-
     sity; type of internal labels, if any; volume serial number, if applicable; numbers of tracks; character
     code/software dependency; and information about block size. For numeric data files, include record

   format and logical record length, if applicable; data set names and sequence, if applicable; and the
   number of records for each data set.
   6.9.2. Other External Labels. Use the labels in paragraphs 6.9.2.1. through 6.9.2.3. as required. Note:
   If unable to affix labels to any media, place the media in an envelope and affix the labels to the enve-
   lope or container.
       6.9.2.1. Records Management Disposition Control Label. The OPR places the label on guide
       cards and physical media, as appropriate, and also uses a cross-reference method on that copy.
       6.9.2.2. Standard Forms (SF) 706, Top Secret ADP Media Classification Label; 707, Secret ADP
       Media Classification Label; and 708, Confidential ADP Media Classification Label. Label any
       external medium with the highest classification of the contents when it contains classified infor-
       mation using the appropriate label.
       6.9.2.3. Air Force Visual Aid (AFVA) 33-276, Privacy Act Label. Protect Privacy Act material to
       avoid inadvertent unauthorized access. This label is intended for use on external media such as
       diskettes, CDs, DVDs, etc., not guide cards, file drawers, or other such stationary equipment/
       materials. See AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, for complete details on the use of this visual aid.
   6.9.3. Internal Identification. The originator of the document is responsible for the internal identifica-
   tion. All systems require a unique name for new records or files in order to save the record on the
   medium. The design of each computer operating system determines how physical file names are
   entered into that system. The internal identification of magnetic tapes is controlled by the software
   and written on the beginning of each tape. The OPR provides enough information to identify the
   record and allow quick and easy retrieval. Use the RDS to resolve conflicts between internal and
   external dates prior to purging tapes.
   6.9.4. Internal Indexes. The OPR uses internal indexes with the file plan. At the time the e-record is
   created, the OPR must indicate, as a minimum, the name of the record, the addressee, the date created,
   the name or number of media on which the record is stored, and provide a short summary of the
   record, if possible.

6.10. Selection and Maintenance of Magnetic Storage Media. Records are stored on a variety of stor-
age media, to include paper, magnetic tape, disks, CDs, and DVDs. This paragraph establishes selection
and maintenance policy strictly for magnetic media that store the official e-record. It focuses on e-records
that are parts of e-records systems being maintained outside the official ERK system for good reason.
   6.10.1. Storage Media Selection. The OPR selects appropriate media for storing e-records outside of
   the approved Air Force ERM, according to their life cycle. Media allows easy retrieval in a timely
   fashion, distinguishes between record and non-record material, retains records in a usable format until
   their authorized disposition according to the RDS, and allows a permanent text document to be printed
   on paper or transfer to NARA or the Federal Records Center (FRC) after converting to the acceptable
   format. In the current environment, the most common types of media are diskettes, hard disks, imme-
   diate access storage devices, CD-ROMs and DVDs.
       6.10.1.1. Diskettes. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and Air Force 33-series instructions
       for guidance when using diskettes.
26                                                                      AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008


            6.10.1.1.1. Care of Disks. Prevent disks from damage—do not use rubber bands or paper clips
            on the diskette or its envelope. Keep magnets, including magnetic watches or instruments, at
            least one foot from flexible and rigid disks to prevent erasing ESI stored on those disks.
            6.10.1.1.2. Mailing Diskettes. Protect diskettes from damage and temperature extremes by
            using sturdy envelopes when mailing or carrying diskettes in a briefcase. Hand carry and pass
            diskettes over to security personnel before going through X-Ray machines. Under no circum-
            stances will the AO store diskettes in luggage or briefcases when passing through any security
            X-Ray machines.
            6.10.1.1.3. Wet Diskettes. Prevent computer damage by discarding wet, scratched or damaged
            diskettes and using backup copy.
        6.10.1.2. Handling a CD-ROM or DVD. Maintain the integrity of the disk and the ESI on the disk
        by following care and handlin g guidelines.
            6.10.1.2.1. Handle the disk only by the outer edge to keep fingerprints from the surface.
            6.10.1.2.2. Use a soft, lint-free cloth for cleaning the disk to remove dust or fingerprints.
            6.10.1.2.3. Wipe from the center to the outer edges and never wipe in a circular motion.
            6.10.1.2.4. Do not touch the unlabeled shiny side of a disk — that’s the recording surface.
            6.10.1.2.5. Do not set a disk down on hard surfaces that can scratch the recording surface.
            6.10.1.2.6. Do not use abrasive or solvent cleaners, audio CD disk cleaners, or conventional
            vinyl record cleaning solutions on the disk. Chemical-based cleaners and cleaners that are safe
            for audio CDs may not be safe for other CDs.
        6.10.1.3. Storage.
            6.10.1.3.1. Store disks in their storage cases to avoid scratches.
            6.10.1.3.2. Store disks in a cool, dry place, away from direct light or sunlight. The ideal stor-
            age temperature is between 23° F - 86° F.
            6.10.1.3.3. Do not spill liquids or allow moisture to condense on the disk.
     6.10.2. Online Storage with Hard Disks (to include Servers). A hard disk is a high capacity storage
     and retrieval medium for computers. Hard disks, especially central servers where official records are
     maintained are in common use and require a certain amount of housekeeping in the form of space
     management, indexing, retention management, and backup to preclude losing records.

6.11. Official Records on Personally-Owned Computers, Hand-Held and Blackberries. The COR is
responsible for the official records created by those assigned to his or her office. CORs develop and mon-
itor processes to ensure employees do not use personally-owned computers (including systems at home)
to maintain or store Air Force (Government) records (AFI 33-202, Volume 1, Network and Computer
Security). Employees (military, civilian and contractor) must transfer records created on a person-
ally-owned computers such as laptops, handheld, or stored on thumb drives to the office repository. The
COR monitors and ensures the transfer of records to an approved repository is accomplished with two
workdays.
AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008                                                                                27


6.12. Judicial Use of Records. Records on any media may contain information that is of legal signifi-
cance and may be admitted as evidence in state or federal court proceedings if authenticity, accuracy, and
general trustworthiness are established. ESI should be stored in a system and integrity must be established
by documenting the system’s operation and have controls imposed to enforce records management statu-
tory and policy requirements.
   6.12.1. Air Force Records Searches. The AFRO notifies the Command/Agency RM that a search has
   been requested; Command/Agency RMs follow the instructions that come with the notification. The
   following instructions generally apply to each RP:
       6.12.1.1. Conduct a thorough record search for documents including but not limited to the list of
       categories or key words.
       6.12.1.2. Prepare an index identifying each document by date and author, classification, category,
       and the name, grade, duty location and telephone number of the individuals who performed the
       search.
       6.12.1.3. Separate documents containing Sensitive Compartmented Information and information
       subject to Special Access Program restrictions from other documents. Identify and describe any
       document withheld from production. Provide basis and justification for not producing the docu-
       ment to respond to any challenge as soon as possible but not later than (NLT) the suspense estab-
       lished by the AFRO.
       6.12.1.4. If you do not have possession, custody or control of any requested documents but have
       information concerning the location of such documents, provide that information as soon as possi-
       ble but NLT the suspense established by the AFRO.
       6.12.1.5. The MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU RM compiles a list of responses (inventory of documents
       supplied and lists them by base and OPR responding, phone number, etc.) and provides per the
       instructions provided in the search.

6.13. E-Record System Integrity. To enhance the legal admissibility of Air Force e-records, the office
of record must:
   6.13.1. Document each e-record system that uses the same processes each time to electronically gen-
   erate and store similar kinds of records and uses a standard retrieval approach.
   6.13.2. Substantiate that security procedures for the ERK system prevent anyone from making
   changes or deletions to a record the System Manager did not authorize and that security procedures
   protect against power interruptions.
   6.13.3. Identify the electronic media that stored the records throughout their life cycle, the maximum
   time the e-records remain on each storage medium, and the disposition from the RDS for all e-records.
   Document system operational status to e-record system malfunctions. To the maximum extent practi-
   cable, ensure personal identifiers are recorded for personnel who review, revise, or otherwise affect
   document content. Coordinate items in this paragraph and in 6.13.1. and 6.13.2. with records manage-
   ment and legal personnel.

6.14. Security of Electronic Records (E-Records). Instructions on steps required prior to reusing mag-
netic media that have stored classified records are in AFSSI 5020, (FOUO) Remanence Security.

6.15. Web Records and Web Pages. Web Records and Web Pages require life-cycle management
according to the Air Force RDS. The web author (person who provides the information to the web master)
must provide the organization’s record professional a monthly index of the disposition, date, and title of
each record on the web site. The record professional will identify the record location on the file plan, per-
form periodic reviews for record management life-cycle requirements, and report discrepancies and lost
records (AFI 33-364). Web authors will prepare an AF Form 525, Records Disposition Recommendation
(see Figure 6.2., Figure 6.3., Table 6.1. and AFI 33-364), for unscheduled records on the Web. Publish
the web author and page master name and contact information to provide users record dispositions when
a web page contains records with multiple dispositions.

    6.15.1. Non-Web Records. Previous versions of a Web page that do not qualify as records are defined
    as “non-record” material and should be overwritten or deleted from the system within 30 days of the
    final posting of the updated version of the Web page. Submit requests for waivers or exceptions to the
    AFRO through the base and CRM or ARM.

6.16. Duplicate Records on Mixed Media. When records are duplicated on different media, the COR
must determine which medium has the official record and ensure the official record is managed according
to the appropriate records management instruction. Record copies are disposed of when no longer needed.

6.17. Records Integration. Electronic records may be integrated with those on other media. Limit use of
mixed media (e.g., paper and diskette) for parts of the same records. Where similar records that would
normally be grouped together (i.e., as for a case file) are on mixed media, provide for as much integration
of the records as possible or practical by converting all the records to a single media (e.g., all paper or all
electronic). Digitize incoming paper records by using scanners that save the documents in a PDF if signa-
ture authentication is not critical. Merge scanned records with their related electronic records. If appropri-
ate, print e-records or convert to some other medium. However, keep scanned documents to a minimum
due to the disk space of scanned documents.

6.18. Cross-Referencing. When necessary to keep related documents in two or more places or on two or
more media, cross-reference the records to the related stored records on different media. Identify all
e-records and their location on the file plan.

6.19. Appropriate Storage Media for Electronic Records (E-Records). Factors that influence infor-
mation loss on magnetic media include the variety of materials used by magnetic media manufacturers;
media storage and handling conditions; media usage; frequency of use, and changing technology. Where
less than optimal conditions prevail, loss of all or part of the record is possible. The COR must perform a
32                                                                      AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008


risk assessment to determine the appropriate medium for storage wherever records loss is at issue, espe-
cially records in deployed locations.

6.20. Retention Standards. The functional OPR of any system outside an ERK solution, such as AISs
that manage records, must make provisions to retain the e-records and their documentation for as long as
the Air Force needs them. These ERK systems must be approved by the AFRO and NARA.

6.21. Schedule Disposition. Schedule the disposition of all e-records as well as related documentation
and indexes. Records dispositions covering paper records also cover e-records in the same series. How-
ever, if the e-records are unscheduled, the functional OPR for the system must submit an AF Form 525 to
the BRM (including those operated for the Air Force and Unified and Specified Commands by a contrac-
tor) not later than one year after implementing the ERK system.

6.22. Setting Up Official Electronic Records (E-Records). Until there is an Air Force-approved
Records Management Application for records that have a non-permanent disposition, use the latest ver-
sion of the Air Force ERM Solution document (https://afrims.amc.af.mil/web_links.cfm). Bases, MAJ-
COMs, DRUs, and FOAs currently using their own integrations of recordkeeping systems must prepare
for transitioning into the Air Force-approved Records Management Application.

6.23. Scheduling Planned or Operational Systems. OPRs schedule information in each system in a
comprehensive manner by including data sets and files in the system; source documents and outputs; the
processing subset and special format files the system creates and uses; and system documentation and
data descriptions. OPRs also establish disposition instruction for each of these components in light of the
overall system. If the RDS does not contain an authorized disposition, the functional OPR must submit an
AF Form 525 through records management channels.

6.24. Destroying Electronic Records (E-Records). The record professional destroys e-records accord-
ing to authorized dispositions and ensures that the record is disposed of in a manner that protects any sen-
sitive, proprietary, or national security information.

6.25. Transferring Electronic Records (E-Records) to National Archives and Records Administra-
tion (NARA). NARA accepts transfer copies of e-records, related documentation, and indexes at the
times specified in the RDS. Transfer may take place at an earlier date if convenient for both Air Force and
NARA. NARA accepts e-records in three types of transfer media: magnetic tape, CD-ROM and file trans-
fer protocol (FTP). Transfer permanent e-records to NARA as soon as possible.
     6.25.1. Formats to Transfer E-Records. Transfer e-records to NARA in a format that is not dependent
     on specific hardware or software, written in American Standard Code for Information Interchange
     (ASCII) or Extended Binary-Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) with all extraneous control
     characters removed (except record length indicators for variable length records, marks delimiting a
     data element, field, record or file, or Standard Generalized Markup Language tags). Do not compress
     records unless pre-approved by NARA. Transfer data files and databases as flat files or as rectangular
     tables, that is, as two-dimensional arrays, lists or tables. All records in a relational database should
     have the same logical format. Each data element within a record should contain only one data value.
     A record should not contain nested repeating groups of data items. Transfer documentation in elec-
     tronic format as separate files; the transfer format standards for e-records apply to documentation
     files.
AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008                                                                                  33


  6.25.2. Use SF 258, Agreement to Transfer Records to the National Archives of the United States. The
  OPR prepares and sends the SF 258 and AF Form 1341 through the BRM and CRM to Air Force
  Records Office (AF.Records@pentagon.af.mil) for AFRO approval and signature prior to transfer-
  ring files to NARA. Additional guidance on transferring permanent e-records is found on NARA’s
  web site http://www.archives.gov.
  6.25.3. Transfer of Magnetic Tape. Agencies may transfer e-records to NARA on magnetic tape using
  either open-reel magnetic tape or tape cartridges. Open-reel tape should be on one-half inch 9-track
  tape reels recorded at 1600 or 6250 bytes per inch and blocked no higher than 32,760 bytes per block.
  Tape cartridges may be 18-track 3480-class cartridges recorded at 37,871 bits per inch and blocked at
  no more than 32,760 bytes per block, or DLT tape IV cartridges that must be recorded in an uncom-
  pressed format.
  6.25.4. Transfer of Compact Disk-Read Only Memory (CD-ROM). CD-ROMs may be used as trans-
  fer media for fielded data files or text files if they: conform to the International Organization for Stan-
  dardization 9660 standard and to ASCII; are not compressed unless NARA has approved the transfer
  of the compressed form in advance; and are individually addressable. The CD-ROMs may contain
  software files and temporary records, but permanent records must be in files that contain only perma-
  nent records.
  6.25.5. File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Use FTP to transfer e-records scheduled for preservation into
  NARA. Review 36 CFR 1228.270 (c)(3), available at http://www.archives.gov/about/regulations/
  part-1228/l.html for specific requirements related to FTP transfers.
  6.25.6. Servicing Documentation. When transferring records to NARA, the OPR sends adequate ser-
  vicing documentation sufficient to support the use of the records for secondary analysis. Include spe-
  cific information on how the media was written, identification and the definition of data sets
  transferred, record layouts with their relative positions, completed AF Form 1341 with a data dictio-
  nary that defines all data elements, code books for unique codes in the records, and completed
  National Archives (NA) Form 14097, Technical Description for Transfer of Electronic Records to the

approval. After permanent records have been copied onto an optical disk, they should be transferred to the
appropriate inactive storage facility. Joint Staff/combatant command activities seeking authorization to
destroy permanent records after copying onto optical disks must submit their requirements through the
appropriate Joint Staff/Headquarters Combatant Command RM. The Combatant Command RM
coordinates with the AFRO regarding approval of such requests. (2) Analog videodiscs that typically
contain photographs are another type of optical disk that can be accessioned by NARA provided no
interactive software or nonstandard equipment is required to read them. Original photographs appraised
as permanent and copied onto a videodisc must be scheduled for transfer to NARA together with a copy
of the videodisc. Compact disks used for digital audio playback may be transferred because they use a
standard player and require no special software to use.

                                       VITAL RECORDS PLAN

A5.1. Each unit should develop a vital records plan. The plan is a description of records that are vital to
continue operations or for the protection of legal and financial rights. The plan also includes specific mea-
sures for the appropriate storage and periodic cycling (updating) of copies of those records.

A5.2. The description of the vital records is based on identification and inventorying. Units may take the
following steps to identify and inventory vital records:
   A5.2.1. Consultation with the official responsible for emergency coordination.
   A5.2.2. Review base statutory and regulatory responsibilities and existing emergency plans for
   insights into the functions and records that may be included in the vital records inventory.
   A5.2.3. Review of documentation created for the contingency planning and risk assessment phase of
   emergency preparedness. The offices performing those functions would be an obvious focus of an
   inventory.
   A5.2.4. Review of current files plans of offices that are responsible for performing critical functions
   or may be responsible for preserving rights.
   A5.2.5. Review of the AFRIMS RDS to determine which records series potentially qualify as vital.

A5.3. Organizations must exercise caution in designating records as vital and in conducting the vital
records inventory. A review of the available literature suggests that from 1 to 7 percent of an organiza-
tion’s records may be vital records. Only those records series or electronic information systems (or por-
tions of them) most critical to emergency operations or the preservation of legal or financial rights should
be so designated. CORs make judius decisions identifying the function’s vital records and approving the
vital record inventory.

A5.4. The inventory of vital records should include:
   A5.4.1. The name of the office responsible for the records series or electronic information system
   containing vital information.
   A5.4.2. The title of each records series or information system containing vital information.
   A5.4.3. Indication of whether the series or system is an emergency operating vital record or a vital
   record relating to rights.
   A5.4.4. The medium on which the record is recorded.
   A5.4.5. The physical location for offsite storage of copies of the records series or system.
   A5.4.6. The frequency with which the records are to be cycled (updated).
   A5.4.7. A licensed copy of the software to enable software-dependent vital records to be used
58                                                                      AFMAN33-363 1 MARCH 2008

                                  RECORD SEARCH PROCEDURES

A6.1. The Air Force Record Officer will direct MAJCOM, FOA and DRU Records Managers to conduct
non-FOIA record searches upon receipt of a written request to perform a departmental record search.
Command and Agency Record Managers in turn task Wing/Base and Unit Record Professionals. Wing/
Base and Unit Records Professionals in turn disseminate task to the Wing/Base and Number AF Com-
manders and each 2-digit office of record at the installation under their jurisdiction.

A6.2. The tasking may be further disseminated to each Functional Area Records Managers (FARM), and
Record Technician/Records Custodian. The Chief Office of Record (COR) monitors the search and
ensures an exhaustive, system-wide search of all active and inactive ESI to include final and draft records,
physical and electronic, relating to the search criteria have been reviewed.

A6.3. Search criteria is based upon the request. Requesters will provide the categories that drive the
search criteria. The following is an example of the criteria that could be used: Records search for docu-
ments pertaining to subject (contract number, weapon system, etc). A record search may include broad
categories such as personnel, finance, training, schooling, and unit records, daily unit strength reports, or
be very narrow and focus on a skill, qualification, or security clearance.

A6.4. Typical instructions to each record professional:
     A6.4.1. Conduct a thorough record search for documents including but not limited to the following
     categories: personnel, finance, training, schooling, drill/attendance, unit records, daily unit strength
     reports, skills, qualifications, medical, equipment accountability, security clearance, and billeting.
     A6.4.2. Prepare an index identifying each document found by date. author, classification, record cat-
     egory, media and location.
     A6.4.3. Prepare a list of the all individuals, grade, duty location, email address, telephone numbers
     (commercial and DSN), and the estimated manhours (authorizations, rank or grade, and hours spent)
     to conduct each search. This information is submitted whether or not responsive documents are found.
     A6.4.4. Segregate and mark documents containing Sensitive Compartmented Information and infor-
     mation subject to Special Access Program restrictions. Identify and describe any document withheld
     from production, even temporarily, for any reason. Provide basis and justification for withholding the
     document to respond to any challenge as soon as possible but by the no later than (NLT) date supplied
     in search request.
     A6.4.5. If you do not have possession, custody or control of any requested documents but have infor-
     mation concerning the location of such documents, provide that information as soon as possible but
     NLT date for search. Often a day earlier than the date in search request to give legal staff reasonable
     time to respond to the information.
     A6.4.6. Record professionals will up-channel search results to include list of searchers, time used for
