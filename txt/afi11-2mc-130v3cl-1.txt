                    AFSOC BRIEFING GUIDES


This checklist supplements the expanded checklists found in AFI 11-
2MC-130 Volume 3 MC-130 Operations Procedures, and is applicable
to all AFSOC MC-130 and C-130E/H aircrews. This checklist is meant
to be printed on standard 8 ½” x 11” bond paper, then trimmed to fit the
standard plastic aircrew checklist binders. Units may locally reproduce
this checklist double sided on card stock to provide a more durable
product for the checklist binder inserts.
