                                            Chapter 5

                      AIRCREW QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes aircrew qualification evaluations to
ensure qualification of aircrew members and supplementary evaluations to ensure
standardization of operations.
   5.1.1. To promote efficient use of flying resources, accomplish aircrew qualification
   evaluations concurrently, whenever practical.
   5.1.2. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM supplements.
   For specialized aircrew, see Chapter 8. For guidance on supplementary evaluations, see
   Chapter 9.
5.2. Categories. Aircrew qualification evaluations are divided into five categories
(Qualification (QUAL), Instrument (INSTM), Mission (MSN), Instructor (INSTR), and SPOT)
each consisting of two structured phases, ground and flight. (EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations
may consist of either a ground or flight phase.) Each phase requires the completion of requisite
tasks (see paragraph 5.5). (EXCEPTION: a SPOT evaluation has no requisite tasks.)
   5.2.1. QUAL Evaluations.
       5.2.1.1. Purpose. Ensure basic qualification in an MDS and/or crew position.
       5.2.1.2. Execution. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their
       primary assigned aircraft/crew position as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol
       2. QUAL evaluations may be combined with INSTM and/or MSN evaluations IAW AFI
       11-2MDS, Vol 2. See Chapter 8 for specialized aircrew.
   5.2.2. INSTM Evaluations.
       5.2.2.1. Purpose. Obtain/maintain instrument qualification in order to operate under
       Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
       5.2.2.2. Execution. All USAF pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with the
       USAF, e.g., exchange pilots) will obtain/maintain instrument qualification by
       successfully completing a periodic INSTM evaluation.
           5.2.2.2.1. EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI
           11-401, Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft
           pilots; T-41/51/52 pilots.
           5.2.2.2.2. Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be assigned to other
           aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification, but will take their
           INSTM checkride in the non-excepted aircraft.
           5.2.2.2.3. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification will not fly
           under IFR except under supervised status in a training program leading to
           requalification. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed above.)
   5.2.3. MSN Evaluations.
20                                           AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013


     5.2.3.1. Purpose. To ensure qualification to employ the aircrew’s assigned weapon
     system/crew position in the accomplishment of the unit’s operational or Designated
     Operational Capability (DOC) statements mission(s).
     5.2.3.2. Execution. All aircrew members maintaining Mission Ready (MR)/Combat
     Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status (IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
     Aircrew Training) will complete a periodic MSN evaluation as specified in the applicable
     AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.1. EXCEPTION: The requirement for a MSN evaluation may be waived for
        those aircraft where performance of normal operational, test, and training sorties
        involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM and/or QUAL
        evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Document waiver via memorandum
        for record (MFR) to be included in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2. HQ
        USAF/A3O-A approval is not required for such waivers. Specify approval
        procedures in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction or in the applicable AFI 11-
        2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.2. The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required
        in fulfillment of the aircraft’s operational or DOC statement missions.
  5.2.4. INSTR Evaluations.
     5.2.4.1. Purpose. To qualify aircrew as instructors in their weapon system/crew position
     by focusing primarily on the examinees instructional ability.
     5.2.4.2. Execution. Aircrew members obtaining/regaining instructor qualification in a
     weapon system/crew position must complete evaluations of instructional capability in
     that weapon system/crew position. Guidance for specialized, universal, and/or multiple
     qualified aircrew will be specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or AFI 11-2MDS Vol
     2. EXCEPTION: For units undergoing aircraft conversion, when a complement of
     current and qualified Air Force instructors does not exist to accomplish initial unit
     instructor qualification, with MAJCOM/A3 approval and Lead MAJCOM/A3
     coordination the OG/CC may establish an Initial cadre (minimum required for initial
     conversion) of flight instructors who do not require an INIT INSTR evaluation. Initial
     cadre must be current and qualified instructors in a US Air Force aircraft who will remain
     in the same crew position on the new aircraft. OG/CCs will notify MAJCOMs and
     provide initial cadre list for each crew position with current qualification and total flight
     and instructor hours. OG/CCs will use discretion when establishing initial cadre
     instructors and consider availability of suitable instructor courses. See also paragraph
     5.13.
        5.2.4.2.1. Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions
        whenever possible. When students are not available or mission/crew composition
        requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator will
        serve as the student.
        5.2.4.2.2. Evaluations of instructor qualification will be conducted during all
        subsequent periodic evaluations.
AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013                                                           21


         5.2.4.2.3. Instructors who expire on their INSTM, QUAL, and/or MSN checkrides
         evaluations are not qualified to instruct in those areas (e.g. if an IP expires on his/her
         MSN zone, he/she may still instruct in INSTM/QUAL-related areas as specified in
         AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2).
         5.2.4.2.4. (Added-433AW) FTU instructor candidates who wish to reset their basic
         qualification expiration date in conjunction with their initial instructor evaluation will
         comply with the following:
            5.2.4.2.4.1. (Added-433AW) Home unit Stan/Eval function must approve by
            name each individual who requests to reset basic qualification expiration date.
            5.2.4.2.4.2. (Added-433AW) All requisite testing will be accomplished prior to
            reporting to the FTU. Home unit DOV function will provide dates/scores of all
            requisite testing via email or hand carried letter sent with the student.
            5.2.4.2.4.3. (Added-433AW) The initial instructor portion of the evaluation and
            evaluations for other FTU students have priority over completion of the
            instrument/qualification/mission (I/Q/M) evaluation.
            5.2.4.2.4.4. (Added-433AW) The evaluation will include all required areas for
            an I/Q/M evaluation. If all required areas are not covered, the evaluation will not
            count as an I/Q/M evaluation.
  5.2.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional).
     5.2.5.1. Purpose. Evaluate a specific event or requirement without intending to satisfy
     the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial INSTR evaluation.
     5.2.5.2. Execution. A SPOT has no specific requisites, unless specified in MAJCOM
     supplements, but may be No Notice IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.
         5.2.5.2.1. An examinee may utilize a SPOT evaluation to update a
         QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
         evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.8 (document on
         the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.1. OG/CCs may authorize additional flights in order to help the aircrew
            accomplish periodic requirements (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph
            7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.2. When the flight examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not
            qualified in the MDS (e.g. a Senior flight examiner), the evaluation will not be
            credited towards a periodic evaluation.
     5.2.5.3. Any qualifying event and/or evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through
     5.2.4 will be documented as a SPOT evaluation.
  5.2.6. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe
  the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through 5.2.5:
     5.2.6.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type, to include instructor
     qualification, in a specific weapon system/crew position (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT
     MSN, INIT INSTR).

     5.2.6.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
     qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation, loss of currency
     exceeding six months (as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1), completion of
     a qualification evaluation in a different MDS, a recheck following a failed evaluation, or
     a commander-directed downgrade. A requalification evaluation requires AF Form 8/8a
     documentation.
        5.2.6.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The recheck will be IAW the
        guidance for that periodic evaluation.
        5.2.6.2.2. Loss of currency that requires a requal evaluation (IAW AFI11-2MDS Vol
        1). In this case RQ SPOT will be used for documentation (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2).
        The recheck profile will be as directed by the SQ/CC and will include, as a minimum,
        those items for which the individual is non-current and which require an evaluation
        IAW the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1/2.
        5.2.6.2.3. Completion of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS. The recheck
        will be IAW the guidance for the periodic evaluation in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS
        Vol 2 and will include, as a minimum, those items for which the individual is
        regaining qualification.
        5.2.6.2.4. A flight recheck following a failed periodic evaluation. The recheck will be
        IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.6.1.
        5.2.6.2.5. Loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
        paragraph 5.9). The recheck profile will be as directed by the commander on the AF
        Form 8/8a (see paragraph 7.4).
            5.2.6.2.5.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
            complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.5.1), but the
            flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period and
            the OG/CC determines that qualification will be re-established by completion of
            the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight evaluation.
            5.2.6.2.5.2. To prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
            qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
        5.2.6.2.6. The RQ prefix will not be used under the following circumstances:
            5.2.6.2.6.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
            complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.5.1), but
            the flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period
            and the OG/CC determines that qualification will be re-established by completion
            of the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight evaluation.
            5.2.6.2.6.2. To prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
            qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
     5.2.6.3. No-Notice (N/N).
        5.2.6.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
        daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013                                                        23


          5.2.6.3.2. A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the
          evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. “Normal
          preparation” will be as defined in the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
          5.2.6.3.3. (Added-433AW) The No-Notice (N/N) evaluation program will comply
          with the guidance in the No-Notice program guide. Each crew position in each
          squadron will sample a minimum of 15% of available crew members annually. N/N
          evaluations should be spread throughout the year and not grouped at the beginning or
          end. Since unit manning varies throughout the year, squadrons should compute their
          target numbers no less than semi-annually (quarterly preferred). Report the target
          numbers to OGV or record them in R&C board minutes.
      5.2.6.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
      in a simulator and/or suitable ATD as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
      5.2.6.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
      (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
      evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the
      evaluation) will be explained on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.
5.3. Grading System.
   5.3.1. A two step grading system is used to evaluate and document aircrew performance.
      5.3.1.1. In the first step, individual grades are assigned to each evaluation requisite to
      include the grading of areas/subareas of aircrew performance against established
      evaluation criteria (see paragraph 5.4). Performance less than fully qualified must be
      documented.
      5.3.1.2. In the second step, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a
      compilation of all individual requisite grades (see paragraph 5.3.3.4).
   5.3.2. Performance Areas/Subareas.
      5.3.2.1. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading system.
      Discrepancies will be documented against the established areas/subareas.
          5.3.2.1.1. Q indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of
          all required information and performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
          tolerances.
          5.3.2.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
          tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight
          examiner. Deviations must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances, jeopardize flight
          safety, or be a breach of flight discipline.
          5.3.2.1.3. U indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters thereby
          compromising flight safety, that deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
          adversely affected mission accomplishment, and/or evaluated performance
          constituted a breach of flight discipline. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade
          of U requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the flight
          examiner.
24                                          AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013


     5.3.2.2. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or U require remedial action that includes
     either debriefing discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training.
         5.3.2.2.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of
         the evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides instruction concerning the
         discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
         proficiency.
         5.3.2.2.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by the flight examiner to
         remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
             5.3.2.2.2.1. May include self-study, ground instruction, use of a simulator/ATD
             or flying.
             5.3.2.2.2.2. Will be complete by the last day of the third month following the date
             of the discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 12, additional training must
             be accomplished by 30 Apr 12).
             5.3.2.2.2.3. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of
             additional training, the SQ/CC will review the situation and direct appropriate
             action. Document the circumstances with an MFR to be included in the AF Form
             8/8a (see paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
             5.3.2.2.2.4. Document additional training on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs
             7.3.5.6 and 7.3.7.3.4.
     5.3.2.3. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as “required” in the
     general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.3.2.4. In addition to required areas/subareas, the flight examiner will grade any
     area/subarea observed during an evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts
     the specific evaluation accomplished or overall flight safety.
     5.3.2.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.
     5.3.2.6. Minor momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies
     prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider
     cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
     5.3.2.7. The flight examiner may further identify any area/sub-area as “Commendable”
     if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional
     skill and knowledge. Document IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.2.
  5.3.3. Qualification Levels. Qualification levels are assigned both to individual evaluations
  (i.e. flight evals and EPEs) as well as overall performance. Individual evaluations are graded
  as a compilation of all area/sub-area grades. Overall performance is graded as a compilation
  of all requisite tasks associated with the required evaluation. Both individual and overall
  grades are based on the following.
     5.3.3.1. Q1. The aircrew member demonstrated desired performance and knowledge of
     procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the grading criteria.
     This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted, but may be awarded when
     discrepancies are noted if:
AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013                                                         25


          5.3.3.1.1. No U grades were awarded for any discrepancy area/sub-area.
          5.3.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
          awarding of an overall Q1.
          5.3.3.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were cleared during
          the debrief of that evaluation.
       5.3.3.2. Q2. The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to perform duties safely, but:
          5.3.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
          assigned.
          5.3.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
          5.3.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q2 may be given if there is
          justification based on Q- performance in one or several areas/subareas.
       5.3.3.3. Q3. The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety,
       performance or knowledge.
          5.3.3.3.1. Any critical area graded U requires an overall Q3 (applicable to both flight
          evaluations and EPEs).
          5.3.3.3.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q3 may be given if there is
          justification based on Q-/U performance in one or several non-critical areas/subareas.
       5.3.3.4. Assigning the overall qualification level.
          5.3.3.4.1. The flight-phase flight examiner is the examiner responsible for assigning
          the overall qualification level.
          5.3.3.4.2. An overall grade of Q1 or Q2 will be given only after all evaluation
          requirements (to include requisite examinations) have been completed and given due
          consideration.
          5.3.3.4.3. An overall grade of Q3 may be awarded at any time.
          5.3.3.4.4. While AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may dictate the highest grade for a flight or
          EPE based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will
          always be the determining factor in deciding the overall grade.
       5.3.3.5. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. An EQ may be given, but will
       only be applied to the overall grade - not to separate requisites. Document on the AF
       Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.2. An EQ may be given when:
          5.3.3.5.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
          all phases of the evaluation;
          5.3.3.5.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
          5.3.3.5.3. The aircrew member received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated.
5.4. Evaluation Criteria.
   5.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs, in coordination with the applicable user MAJCOMs, will establish
   and maintain standardized INSTM, MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluation criteria in the
   appropriate AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Lead MAJCOMs will coordinate with the program
 26                                          AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013


   managers of any command-mandated software on any updates of eval criteria to aid in the
   expeditious revision of eval criteria files. Lead MAJCOMs are also responsible for
   coordinating the establishment of the following:
       5.4.1.1. Areas/subareas including the identification of critical areas and those areas
       required for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged into general
       and specific evaluation areas.
          5.4.1.1.1. Critical areas are those areas that, upon failure, would most adversely
          affect the qualification of an aircrew member. Critical areas will include, but are not
          limited to, Airmanship, Safety, and Flight Discipline.
       5.4.1.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Checks. This is required for QUAL
       evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
          5.4.1.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for maintaining required flight
          publications as outlined in applicable AFI11-2MDS volumes.
          5.4.1.2.2. Q performance requires individual flight publications be current and
          properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
          members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
          required for the mission.
       5.4.1.3. An area containing criteria for Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM)
       IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, and
       MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
       5.4.1.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
       and procedures or applicable Host Nation requirements for evaluations administered
       outside of the NAS.
5.5. Requisites. These include both ground and flight phase items. The ground phase, when
required, includes a series of examinations (see Chapter 6) as well as evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment (i.e. EPEs, see paragraph
5.5.1.2). The flight phase includes an in-flight and/or simulator evaluation of aircrew
performance.
   5.5.1. Ground Phase Requisites.
       5.5.1.1. Ground phase requisites for each evaluation include the following.
          5.5.1.1.1. QUAL: Open book examination, closed book examination,
          Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
          5.5.1.1.2. INSTM: Instrument examination
          5.5.1.1.3. MSN: As specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs).
          5.5.1.2.1. Purpose. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs
          and systems for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate mission-specific EPs and tactical
          systems knowledge during MSN evaluations.
AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013                                                           27


         5.5.1.2.1. (433AW) Flight examiners should normally conduct an emergency
         procedures evaluation (EPE) on all evaluations, including Spot evaluations. The EPE
         on a Spot evaluation need not cover all areas required for a Qualification evaluation.
         5.5.1.2.2. Execution. AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 will specify contents of EPEs, areas to be
         evaluated, grading criteria, and whether EPEs may be done in-flight, in a
         simulator/ATD, or verbally.
            5.5.1.2.2.1. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for each combined
            evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation).
            5.5.1.2.2.2. A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
            INSTM/QUAL eval) as long as the combined EPE is of a scope and duration to
            cover required areas and is conducted within the requisite zone for each
            evaluation (see paragraph 5.8).
         5.5.1.2.3. Grading. Q1 performance for EPEs requires taking the proper action in
         the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is responsible
         for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
         5.5.1.2.4. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight
         examiner will indicate if the additional training must be accomplished before the next
         unsupervised flight (see also paragraph 5.3.2.2.2). Document IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.6
         and 7.3.7.3.4.
         5.5.1.2.5. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP
         situation during an EPE requires an EPE grade of 3 (unqualified). Under these
         circumstances, the examinee will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
         accomplished (either written, verbally, or in a simulator/ATD as determined by the
         flight examiner)
         5.5.1.2.6. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an EPE grade of 3
         (unqualified) will be placed on supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7.
  5.5.2. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
  in the weapon system and/or a suitable simulator/ATD (unless restricted by AFI 11-2MDS
  Vol 2).
     5.5.2.1. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
     appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2, and allow accurate
     measure of the proficiency of the examinee.
     5.5.2.2. Evaluation profiles will be realistic, reflect unit tasking, be consistent with daily
     training missions, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission.
  5.5.3. Requisite Completion.
     5.5.3.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
     the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the eligibility period of the
     current evaluation (see paragraph 5.8). The OG/CC may waive this requirement on a
     case-by-case basis (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
 28                                           AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013


       5.5.3.1. (433AW) Evaluation requisites should normally be completed prior to the flight
       phase of scheduled evaluations. Extenuating circumstances requiring flight phase
       accomplishment prior to requisite completion will be discussed with OGV.
       5.5.3.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations accomplished outside
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period
       beginning with the month in which the first ground requisite or flight evaluation was
       administered, whichever occurs first. EXCEPTION: For extended evaluations (IAW
       paragraph 5.8.3.2), requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
       eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
       5.5.3.3. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of combined
       evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.3.4. Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations
       provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite zone for each
       evaluation.
       5.5.3.5. For aircrew possessing instrument qualifications in multiple aircraft, one
       instrument exam may count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs
       within the zone for each evaluation IAW the paragraphs above.
5.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
   5.6.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or ground
   recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure,
   (e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 12, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 12).
       5.6.1.1. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the three-month time limit on a case-by-case
       basis.
          5.6.1.1.1. Document the waiver(s) with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8/8a
          IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
       5.6.1.2. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed during this
       period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and hours of
       training required.
       5.6.1.3. The flight examiner that administered the original check will not normally
       administer the recheck.
       5.6.1.4. A recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q or
       Q-/debriefed criteria for each area graded U.
       5.6.1.5. Ground rechecks may be directed when the flight examiner deems a flight
       recheck unnecessary, but are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of a Q3
       evaluation (document IAW paragraph 7.3.9.2).
       5.6.1.6. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.5.3.1 or 5.5.3.2
       remain valid, IAW the paragraphs above.
   5.6.2. Status Downgrade. Aircrew members receiving a Q3 INSTM, QUAL and/or MSN
   evaluation are non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR)/non-basic
   mission capable(N-BMC)/non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013                                                        29


  For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be downgraded if
  the discrepancies were only in instructor areas/subareas.
  5.6.3. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
  judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
  successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
     5.6.3.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
     requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
         5.6.3.1.1. QUAL Evaluation: Place the examinee on supervised status (see
         paragraph 5.7) in the aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the
         opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For
         specialized, universal, and/or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining qualification for
         similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may direct supervised status in
         all aircraft in which the individual maintains qualification.
         5.6.3.1.2. INSTM Evaluation: Restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
         examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
         5.6.3.1.3. MSN       Evaluation:     The      examinee      may      perform    basic
         qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
         supervised status for mission tasks.
         5.6.3.1.4. INSTR Evaluation (or any evaluation where instructor qualifications are
         being evaluated): Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor
         area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is completed.
         5.6.3.1.4. (433AW) FTU initial instructor candidates who fail their evaluation for
         items graded under General, Qualification/Mission, Instrument (Pilot only), or Tactics
         areas will be considered unqualified in the aircraft. The decision to commit FTU
         resources or return the candidate to their home unit for requalification training rests
         with the 433 OG/CC.
     5.6.3.2. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q3 on any evaluation until a successful recheck is
     completed (see paragraph 5.6.1).
     5.6.3.3. If defined in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1 and/or Vol 2, formal schoolhouses will include
     restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a for any core item not accomplished due to training
     limitations, regardless if the method of qualification is by evaluation or instructor
     certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform core items in which they are
     not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. In this case, MDS-
     specific guidance will set the time requirement for completion of additional training.
     5.6.3.4. Document restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.1.
     5.6.3.5. (Added-433AW) FTU students who fail (Q3) an evaluation will not be
     scheduled to fly until the following items are accomplished:
         5.6.3.5.1. (Added-433AW) Notify 356 Airlift Squadron (AS)/DO of failure.
         5.6.3.5.2. (Added-433AW) 356 AS/DOT enters Commander’s Awareness Program
         (CAP) documentation in the student training folder.

          5.6.3.5.3. (Added-433AW) 356 AS/CC, 356 AS/DO, or 356 AS/ADO briefs student
          on CAP.
5.7. Supervised Status.
   5.7.1. If unsatisfactory performance or restrictions require an examinee be placed on
   supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be
   determined by the SQ/CC and/or as specified in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1.
   5.7.2. Supervision will only be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors.
5.8. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
   5.8.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th
   month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a periodic
   evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 10 expires on 31 Mar 12.).
   5.8.2. Eligibility Period. Periodic evaluations will be scheduled in the eligibility period,
   defined as the six-month period prior to the expiration date.
   5.8.3. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. On a case-by-case basis, periodic evaluations may be
   scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria:
      5.8.3.1. Evaluations Conducted Prior to the Eligibility Period. SQ/CCs may
      authorize individuals to complete periodic evaluations prior to the eligibility period
      (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
      5.8.3.2. Extended Evaluations.
          5.8.3.2.1. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize blanket
          or group extensions on an as-required basis. Requests for extensions at MAJCOM or
          subordinate levels will be submitted IAW paragraph 1.3.2.
          5.8.3.2.2. MAJCOM-Extended          Evaluations. MAJCOM/A3s     may    extend
          evaluation expiration dates for aircrew members for up to six months. Provide
          notification to AF/A3O when extensions are approved (copy to AF/A3O-AI).
          Provide guidance for MAJCOM extensions in MAJCOM supplements to this
          instruction.
          5.8.3.2.3. SQ/CC-Extended Evaluations. SQ/CCs may extend the expiration date
          of periodic evaluations up to three months for the reasons listed below (document
          IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2). Extensions will be on a case-by-case basis and this
          paragraph is not authority to grant blanket extensions. For individual extensions
          longer than three months, see paragraph 5.8.3.2.2. For group or blanket extensions,
          see paragraph 5.8.3.2.1. Requisites not completed during the original eligibility
          period must be completed prior to the extended expiration date.
              5.8.3.2.3.1. PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
              5.8.3.2.3.2. Departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.
              5.8.3.2.3.3. Undergoing unit aircraft conversion, as directed by MAJCOM.
              5.8.3.2.3.4. Removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or retirement).
              5.8.3.2.3.5. Participation in real world operations (to include operations other
AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013                                                             31


              than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required flight evaluation(s)
              before or during deployment.
       5.8.3.3. Non-Standard Approval Authority
           5.8.3.3.1. For SQ/CCs and above (e.g. OG/CCs, WG/CCs, etc.), the approval
           authority is the next commander in the examinee’s flying chain of command.
           5.8.3.3.2. In all other cases, if the flying chain of command differs from
           administrative chain of command (e.g. HHQ attached flyers), approvals will be by the
           attached unit/CC with the concurrence of the examinee’s immediate administrative
           supervisor.
           5.8.3.3.3. For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval
           authority.
   5.8.4. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
   member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
   eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.2) or within the
   period for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.3), the aircrew
   member loses the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph
   5.6.3 apply.
       5.8.4.1. Qualification may be re-established by accomplishing a complete requalification
       evaluation (to include requisites) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation.
       5.8.4.2. OG/CCs may waive the re-accomplishment of completed requisites on a case-
       by-case basis (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
   5.8.5. FTU students, initial qual and requal aircrew members will complete all requisites and
   flight evaluation within a six month period. The OG/CC may waive this requirement on a
   case-by-case basis, document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2, and report this in
   the SEB minutes.
5.9. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (squadron or above) may direct a
downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific area/sub-area without unqualifying an individual. Additionally, a
commander may direct a downgrade that either removes a qualification (e.g. IP to MP) or
completely unqualifies an individual (e.g. MP to UP). Downgrades may be directed without
administering an evaluation using the following guidance:
   5.9.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only (e.g., breach of flying discipline, flight
   safety, etc.). Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner, but may be
   recommended by an examiner from any MDS/aircrew specialty.
   5.9.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
   administrative or judicial actions (e.g. Letter of Counseling, Article 15, etc.). (Consult with
   the supporting SJA office for legal advice in these cases.) Use in cases where such incidences
   directly affect the commander’s confidence in the aircrew member’s ability to safely operate
   the aircraft and/or equipment (e.g. lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the
   aircrew’s decision-making abilities in the aircraft).
 32                                           AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013


   5.9.3. For downgrades that either remove qualifications or completely unqualify an
   individual, the affected aircrew will cease acting in the qualification(s) from which they have
   been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade.
   5.9.4. Commander Directed Downgrades will be documented IAW paragraph 7.4.
5.10. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members who
maintain qualification in two or more MDS aircraft. For Universal Qualification see paragraph
5.11.
   5.10.1. When differences between aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead
   MAJCOM, in coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate
   qualification requirements.
   5.10.2. When separate qualifications are not required, document certification in different
   MDS series using AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. In lieu of the AF Form
   4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized
   official.
   5.10.3. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
   including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   See AFI 11-202, Vol 1.
   5.10.4. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
   include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified by
   the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are directed by
   the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
   5.10.5. QUAL and MSN Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL evaluation, and, if
   applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each MDS aircraft they maintain
   qualification according to applicable AFI MDS Vol 2, or AFI 10-3502 Vol 2.
   5.10.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q3 on an INSTM evaluation results in a
   downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A downgrade
   resulting from a Q3 in a QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft for which the
   evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is
   applicable to additional aircraft.
5.11. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized aircrew
who maintain qualification in two or more MDS where qualification is attained/maintained via a
minimum of a ground phase examination. A flight phase evaluation, when required, may be
accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either gaining or maintaining
qualification.
   5.11.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualifications IAW
   Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified crewmember
   eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
   5.11.2. Documentation. See Chapter 7 or Chapter 8, as applicable.
   5.11.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications maintained
   under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A MSN
   evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 and/or MAJCOM supplement
AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013                                                         33


   to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will include a flight phase evaluation in
   one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member maintains qualification.
   5.11.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally qualified
   aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in loss of
   applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI MDS Vol 2.
5.12. Aircrew Flying in Non-USAF Aircraft and with Non-USAF Units. Aircrew members
authorized to perform duties in non-USAF aircraft IAW AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached
to non-USAF units for flying, abide by host service or host country guidance, except for the
requirement to maintain a current physical and review their flight records according to AFI 11-
202, Vol 1 and AFI 11-401.
   5.12.1. Aircrew flying with non-USAF units (i.e. Exchange) do not need to abide by USAF
   guidance, including this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF
   units, they must complete applicable requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF
   evaluations that expired during their tour. The restrictions in paragraph 5.6.3 of this
   instruction apply to such individuals until successful evaluations are completed.
   5.12.2. MAJCOM/A3s may approve exceptions to requirements for returning Exchange
   aircrew members to complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if they
   determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2
   evaluations (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
   5.12.3. USAF units that use non-USAF aircraft to execute a USAF flying program will
   comply with current USAF guidance, unless when excepted by proper authority. See AFI 11-
   401 for definitions of USAF and US Government aircraft.
5.13. Initial Cadre.
   5.13.1. Aircrew members who are appointed by their MAJCOMs as initial cadre either for a
   new mission set requiring a MSN qualification or for a new MDS where no flight examiner
   currently exists will comply with the intent of this instruction.
   5.13.2. See paragraph 7.5 for guidance on Form 8/8a documentation.
   5.13.3. MAJCOMs will indicate through MFR which aircrew are appointed as initial cadre
   and include in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   5.13.4. Tailor recurring evaluations to program requirements and aircraft capabilities.
   Simulators may be used to satisfy recurring evaluation requirements.
   5.13.5. Pilots in these programs will maintain an instrument qualification (see paragraph
   5.2.2). Maintenance of the instrument qualification, if not practical due to the developing
   capabilities of the new mission set and/or MDS, will be accomplished in aircraft possessing
   similar flying qualities/instrumentation as stipulated in the MAJCOM supplement/AFI 11-
   MDS Vol 2/MOU.
5.14. Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA). When RPA aircrew members are not qualified in
certain areas (e.g. launch and recovery), provide comment and document restrictions in the
remarks section of the AF Form 8. See paragraph 7.3.7.1.
 34                                          AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013

                         AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written or computer-
based examinations.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) pilots,
navigators, combat systems operators, and air battle managers), CEA, non-rated X-prefix AE
aircrew and RPA sensor operators. For Flight Surgeons (rated), Combat Camera, and non-rated
aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code) that only require an examination to
establish qualification, see Chapter 8. The examination program in this chapter includes
requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and unit periodic examinations. Requisite
examinations include qualification open book and closed book examinations, instrument
examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in paragraph 5.5.1.1.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will document the unit-level aircrew examination
   program.
   6.3.1. (433AW) Examinations will be administered in accordance with the Testing program
   guide. All testing for permanent party periodic evaluations will be administered by OGV.
   FTU student examinations may be administered by OGV or ATS contract personnel.
   6.3.2. Computer-Based Examinations. MAJCOM directed Stan/Eval software may fulfill
   the requirement for exams as outlined in this instruction.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. Retain graded exam answer sheets/computer
   records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
6.4. Exam Sources.
   6.4.1. Open Book Exams. Open book questions will come from publications containing
   information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and performance of the assigned
   mission.
   6.4.1. (433AW) Open book examination questions will come from appropriate MDS
   Technical Orders, AFI 11-2MDSV3, Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
   (AFTTP) 3-3.C5 (C-5), and other sources designated applicable by 433 OG/OGV.
       6.4.1.1. The open book subject areas and the publications used to generate the exam will
       be made available to aircrew during testing. Electronic publications may be used as
       references for open book examinations.
       6.4.1.2. Each unit will develop an open book Secure Question Bank (SQB) that serves as
       the source for the open book exam. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
       safeguard it in the same manner as any other required Stan/Eval exam.
   6.4.2. Closed Book Exams. Questions will come from MQFs.
AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013                                                         35


   6.4.2. (433AW) Closed book examinations will be derived from AMC generated Master
   Question Files (MQFs) as prescribed in AFI 11-202V2, AMC supplement 1.
       6.4.2.1. MDS/crew position-specific MQFs. Lead MAJCOMs will ensure MDS/crew-
       specific MQFs are available for using MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable
       aircrew.
          6.4.2.1.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
          administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
          procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
          6.4.2.1.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate MAJCOM.
          Lead MAJCOMs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes to MQFs as
          necessary.
       6.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local procedures
       MQF to augment MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   6.4.3. Instrument Exams. Reference AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program.
   Units will ensure that only those questions relevant to the weapons system(s) and instrument
   procedures within their unit are included in the available questions from which aircrew will
   test.
   6.4.3. (433AW) Instrument examinations will be derived from the Air Force Flight
   Standards Agency (AFFSA) question data bank (QDB) as prescribed in AFI 11-202V2,
   AMC supplement 1.
   6.4.4. Exam Question Review. The MAJCOM, NAF, and OG Stan/Eval functions will
   review all MDS/crew position-specific MQFs, SQBs, and prepared exams (if used) annually
   and after any changes in source documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a
   source document change it may be annotated as the annual review. Units will document
   procedures for the exam reviews in their supplement to this instruction.
   6.4.4. (433AW) OGV will review all QDBs annually in January and after changes in source
   documents. When new QDBs (MQF, Instrument test bank, etc.) are released, OGV will
   review all questions for accuracy. Questions determined to be invalid will be corrected or
   removed from the QDB.
6.5. End-of-Course Exams. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses listed in the Air
Force      Education     and    Training    Course     Announcement        (ETCA)    database
(https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) exams to fulfill the requirements
of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite exams.
   6.5.1. The Stan/Eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate with
   the MDS lead MAJCOM to ensure the EOC exam meets the requirements of this instruction
   and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 before awarding credit for requisite completion.
   6.5.2. EOC exam questions do not need to incorporate MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures and
   not conflict with any MQFs.
   6.5.3. All EOC exams that fulfill the requirements of requisite exams will be graded
   according to paragraph 6.8 and entered on the AF Form 8/8a according to paragraph 7.3.5.1.
 36                                           AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013


6.6. Exam Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs exams, units will either
maintain prepared exams for each crew position or generate a unique exam for each aircrew
member.
6.6. (433AW)Exam Management. Permanent party examinations will be administered using
MAJCOM approved testing software. Examinations will be randomly generated for each
individual. OGV will maintain two hard copy backup examinations for each requisite
examination. Hard copy examinations will only be administered when circumstances preclude
administration of computer tests.
   6.6.1. If prepared exams are maintained for each crew position:
       6.6.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two exams for each
       crew position.
       6.6.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one exam.
       6.6.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information, units are
       not required to maintain separate exams for each crew position.
       6.6.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on each prepared exam each
       calendar year.
   6.6.2. If a unique exam is generated for each aircrew member:
       6.6.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for exam creation.
       6.6.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain at least twice the number of questions
       required for each exam (e.g. if a 50-question exam is generated, there must be at least 100
       questions in the exam database).
   6.6.3. When published guidance changes, the associated prepared exam or exam database
   (depending on method used) will be updated as soon as possible upon receipt.
6.7. Exam Security. Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all requisite exams,
applicable answer sheets, and associated computer-based media.
6.8. Grading.
   6.8.1. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs exams on the two-tier grading system (i.e.
   Q/U). Satisfactory performance requires writing the proper actions in the correct sequence,
   not necessarily a verbatim response. The minimum passing grade is 100 percent.
   6.8.2. Written or Computer-Based Examinations. Grade written or computer based
   examinations as a percentage of correct answers. The minimum passing grade is 85 percent.
   All questions missed will be reviewed immediately following the exam.
   6.8.3. Units will grade all requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew
   member’s next flight.
6.9. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam.
   6.9.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination must be
   afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other than Boldface/CAPs, the
   aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013                                                          37


   6.9.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite exam must complete a
   successful reexam by the end of the third month following the date of the first failure, or the
   end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first. Waiver authority to extend the time
   allowed to successfully complete the reexam is the OG/CC (document IAW paragraph
   7.8.3.2.2).
   6.9.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
   Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful Boldface/CAPs
   reexam is accomplished.
   6.9.4. Supervised Status.
      6.9.4.1. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite open/closed book or instrument
      exam in supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7 until successful retesting is completed.
      6.9.4.2. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status
      resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the
      aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of the instrument exam
      results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all aircraft in which
      instrument qualification is required.
6.10. Unit Periodic Examinations (Optional). If used, MAJCOMs and/or units will include
guidance in their supplements to include procedures for failed exams.
6.10. (433AW)Unit Periodic Examinations (Optional). 433 OG/OGV has no periodic testing
program. Squadrons may develop a periodic testing program. If done, the program will be
detailed in the squadron testing program guide.
   6.10.1. Each group/squadron Stan/Eval function may conduct periodic testing for all aircrew.
   The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite
   exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or
   operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit.
   6.10.2. Administration of the exam is at the discretion of the MAJCOM and/or unit.
   6.10.3. Periodic exams will not count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy
   the requirement for a periodic exam.

                                            Chapter 7

                                      DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications for which an aircrew member is to be evaluated are
determined from the unit certification document. This chapter provides documentation guidance
for members that require an in-flight evaluation to establish qualification. See Chapter 8 for
documentation guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-rated aircrew that
only require an examination to establish qualification.
7.1. (433AW)Scope. Aircrew evaluation documentation will be completed, routed and filed in
accordance with the Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) program guide.
   7.1.1. The results of aircrew evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8/8a. The
   chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF Form 942,
   Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF.
   7.1.2. In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use
   of electronic signatures and wholly electronic FEFs IAW MAJCOM supplement guidance. In
   all instances, computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published on the USAF E-
   Publishing web site.
7.2. Qualifications versus Certifications. Qualifications are attained through evaluations and
documented on the AF Form 8/8a, as applicable. Certifications are attained through methods
other than evaluation (e.g. commander certifications, flight lead upgrades, etc.) and may be
documented on an AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications or on a unit certification
document signed by an authorized official.
7.3. AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. The AF Form 8/8a is the source document used to record and verify the
   qualification of an aircrew member.
       7.3.1.1. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification in a single aircraft.
       7.3.1.2. Use of the AF Form 8a is optional for aircrew maintaining qualification in
       multiple aircraft and/or multiple series qualification in the same MDS or are Universal
       Qualified.
       7.3.1.2. (433AW) Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members (AECM)s will use the AF
       Form 8.
       7.3.1.3. Completion of an AF Form 8/8a is accomplished by four individuals: the flight
       examiner, a Reviewing Officer, a Final Approving Officer, and the examinee.
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8, Attachment 4 for
   sample AF Forms 8a.
   7.3.2. (433AW) See Attachment 5 of the FEF program guide for sample AF Form 8s.
       7.3.2.1. In all instances of data entry, if an electronic form is used, the format required by
       the electronic form will be used (see also paragraph 7.1.2).
AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013                                                          39


     7.3.2.2. For date fields use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit year format
     (e.g. 24 Jun 12).
     7.3.2.3. The “Eligibility Period” and “Expiration Date of Qualification” blocks will use a
     three-letter month and two-digit year format (Jun 12).
     7.3.2.4. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation,
     “INSTR”), use upper and lower case letters.
     7.3.2.5. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
     data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
     desired.
  7.3.3. Date Completed.
     7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date of the evaluation requisites (ground or flight
     phase) or the additional training if assigned.
     7.3.3.2. (Form 8a) Use the latest completion date of all MDS listed.
  7.3.4. - Examinee Identification.

         7.3.4.3.1. Enter the MDS in which the evaluation was given
         7.3.4.3.2. (Form 8a) Enter the aircraft MDS in which the flight phase evaluation
         was given. When no flight phase evaluation was accomplished or when aircrew are
         qualified in two or more aircraft IAW Universal Qualification guidelines, enter the
         primary aircraft MDS.
         7.3.4.3.3. Enter the examinee’s highest qualification reflecting the intention of the
         evaluation in that particular MDS. Note: Examiner (e.g. EP, EF, etc.) is not a
         qualification, it is a certification, and should only be entered when the flight examiner
         is receiving a SPOT Flight Examiner Objectivity evaluation IAW MAJCOM
         supplements.
     7.3.4.4. Eligibility Period.
         7.3.4.4.1. Enter the 6-month period preceding the expiration date from the last

         previous evaluation is extended under the provisions of paragraph 5.8.3.2.3, enter the
         6-month period preceding the original expiration date (SQ/CCs extend only the
         expiration date, not the eligibility period).
         7.3.4.4.4. Dual entries are authorized for misaligned combined evaluations (e.g., if
         last INSTM evaluation expires Nov 12 and QUAL evaluation expires Jan 13, enter
         “INSTM: Jun-Nov 12/QUAL: Aug 12-Jan 13” for an INSTM/QUAL evaluation).

        7.3.5.2.1. (Form 8a) If applicable governing instructions require non-rated aircrew
        to demonstrate in-flight proficiency in more than one MDS, MAJCOMs may use a
        separate AF Form 8a for each MDS with flight phase evaluations IAW multiple
        qualification guidance in paragraph 5.10 and universal qualification guidance in
        paragraph 5.11.
        7.3.5.2.2. Mission/Check.
            7.3.5.2.2.1. IAW paragraph 5.2, use the following designations to describe the
            purpose of the evaluation(s): INSTM, QUAL, MSN, INSTR, or SPOT. If
            combined, include the designation of each evaluation (e.g., QUAL/MSN,
            INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.).
            7.3.5.2.2.2. Use the following prefixes, when applicable, to describe the type of
            evaluation: INIT, RQ, N/N and/or SIM. More than one prefix may be used to
            describe an evaluation as outlined in paragraph 5.2.6.
                7.3.5.2.2.2.1. The only annotations of INSTR used are INIT INSTR and RQ
                INSTR as described in paragraph 5.2.4.
                7.3.5.2.2.2.2. INSTR will not be used for periodic evaluations as the AF Form
                8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with the instructor designation
                (e.g. IB, IN, IP)
                7.3.5.2.2.2.3. When requalification deals with regaining a complete loss of
                instructor qualification, document it as RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
            7.3.5.2.2.3. Make a single line entry to document the flight(s)/event(s) used to
            complete the evaluation.
            7.3.5.2.2.4. Make multiple single line entries for each flight/event if two or more
            flights/events are required and administered by either different flight examiners or
            on separate days.
            7.3.5.2.2.5. Where a single mission (such as airlift tasking) consists of multiple
            flights over one or more days with the same flight examiners, a single line entry
            may be used.
        7.3.5.2.3. Date.
            7.3.5.2.3.1. Enter the date the flight/event was completed.
            7.3.5.2.3.2. For evaluations where a single mission consists of multiple flights
            over one or more days (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2.5), enter the inclusive dates of the
            flight(s). Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
            7.3.5.2.3.3. For evaluations conducted on missions consisting of a single flight
            spanning more than one day, use a single line entry with the date the mission was
            completed. Document the details IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.2.
     7.3.5.3. Qualification Level.
        7.3.5.3.1. Annotate the examinee’s overall qualification level IAW the definitions of
        paragraph 5.3.3 by placing a “1” (for Q1) or “2” (for Q2) in the qualified block or a
        “3” (for Q3) in the unqualified block.

        7.3.5.3.2. Combined evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL, INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.)
        require only one grade if all evaluations were awarded the same overall level.
            7.3.5.3.2.1. If the overall level varies for each type of evaluation accomplished,
            indicate the qualification level for each part separately (e.g., “INSTM: 1” and
            “QUAL: 2” in the qualified block or “INSTM/MSN: 1” in the qualified block and
            “QUAL: 3” in the unqualified block).

        phase of the evaluation was successfully completed.
        7.3.5.4.2. For evaluations that do not establish a new eligibility period, enter “N/A.”
        7.3.5.4.3. Combined evaluations require only one date if all parts of the evaluation
        were successfully completed and/or “N/A” if all parts were assigned an unqualified
        grade.
            7.3.5.4.3.1. For combined evaluations where one component is successfully
            completed and/or one component is assigned an unqualified grade, indicate by
            assigning a new expiration date for those portions completed successfully, and
            “N/A” for those portions awarded an unqualified grade (e.g., QUAL 1 and
            INSTM 3, then enter “QUAL-Jul 12” under Qualified and “INSTM-N/A” under
            Unqualified).
        7.3.5.4.4. (Form 8a) For evaluations without a flight phase requirement that

            additional training as recommended by the flight examiner, etc.) IAW paragraph
            7.3.7.4 and/or paragraph 7.3.7.5.
        7.3.6.2.3. The Reviewing Officer will sign and date the AF Form 8/8a after the flight
        examiner, but prior to the Final Approval Officer.
        7.3.6.2.4. The Final Approval Officer will sign and date the AF Form 8/8a after the
        Reviewing Officer but prior to the examinee. As applicable, the Final Approving
        Officer may recommend or give a commander-directed downgrade IAW paragraph
        5.9 if further action is warranted.
        7.3.6.2.5. MAJCOMs will specify in the MAJCOM supplement who the reviewing
        and final approving officers will be for evaluations other than formal course
        evaluations accomplished at an FTU. The same individual will not sign as both the
        Reviewing and Final Approving Officer.
        7.3.6.2.6. For evaluations completed at formal course FTU locations, the reviewing
        and final approving officers will be assigned to the FTU.
     7.3.6.3. Organization Block Format. The format and content of data for the
     Organization block for the flight examiner and reviewing and final approving officers
     will be as follows:
        7.3.6.3.1. Flight examiner. Annotate unit/organization and office symbol of the
        flight examiner that completed the evaluation (e.g., 526 ARS/DOT, 12AF/OV,

  7.6.1. Purpose. The AF Form 4348 provides a record of aircrew certification that may be
  kept in the FEF.
  7.6.1. (433AW) 433 AW units will use the Letter of X’s (see Attachment 8) as the unit
  certification document.
     7.6.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 4348 in the FEF, Section I, under tab 1
     documenting certifications by assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew
     members with aircraft certifications in multiple MDS aircraft which do not require
     qualification in each aircraft (e.g. F-16C and F-16CM), only one AF Form 4348 is
     required; specify the primary mission MDS designation.
     7.6.1.2. Unit Stan/Eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
     aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
     certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
     7.6.1.3. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review previous AF Form 4348
     entries to determine all applicable certifications of new assigned/attached aircrew
     member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications accepted by the gaining flying
     unit commander on a new AF Form 4348.
     7.6.1.4. The OGV/squadron Stan/Eval Chief or other individual designated by the
     SQ/CC will sign a one line entry below all other entries verifying that above certification
     transcriptions are accurate.
     7.6.1.5. Do not use AF Form 4348 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
     directed by MAJCOM.
     7.6.1.6. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form 4348
     entry include MAJCOM and/or supplement; AFI11-2MDS Vol 1; AFI11-2MDS Vol 3.
  7.6.2. General Data Entry.
     7.6.2.1. Complete individual identification block with last name, first name, middle
     initial, any titles (e.g., Jr. or II), last four of SSN, unit MDS and unit (assigned/attached
     for flying) organization/location.
     7.6.2.2. Use one line for each certification.
     7.6.2.3. Enter each certification in chronological order based on the date the action is
     completed.
     7.6.2.4. For date fields in the AF Form 4348, use a two-digit day, three-letter month and
     two-digit year format, or as required for electronic forms.
  7.6.3. Certification.
     7.6.3.1. Certified Event Title. Enter each certification title on the top block on the AF
     Form 4348.
     7.6.3.2. Enter the instructor’s rank, name and organization who completed applicable
     training for the certified event below the event title of the Certified Event block for the
     MDS under which the certification is given.

     7.6.3.4. For certifications attained as part of a FTU, the date will match the date of the
     applicable AF Form 8/8a, or enter the date of completion or graduation from FTU if no
     AF Form 8/8a is issued.
     7.6.3.5. Certification Official/Organization. MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF
     Form 4348 certifying officials. The Certifying Official will sign above their typed name,
     rank, organization and office symbol.
     7.6.3.6. The Certifying Official is the person authorized by governing directives to
     approve or certify an aircrew member for a specific position or event.
     7.6.3.7. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on the AF Form
     4348 in the Remarks block.
  7.6.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
  Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
     7.6.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
         7.6.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
         but also applies to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
         substandard performance).
         7.6.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, place an “X” in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7 for example.
     7.6.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
     performance.
         7.6.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
         occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI11-2 Vol 1, when instructor certified events
         become core mission events, or when a higher certification is obtained making the
         previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also applicable for
         decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than substandard
         performance.
         7.6.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification, place an “X” in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7. Note: For decertification
         due to loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the effective date of
         decertification will be the date of certification loss.
         7.6.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
         Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: annotate “Renamed (new
         title)” under Remarks.
         7.6.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
         Stan/Eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new MDS and
         transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.3.
AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013                                                          53


   7.6.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional
   information for an AF Form 4348 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
   AF Form 4348.
   7.6.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 4348. Units may use a computer-generated AF
   Form 4348 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
   maintained. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
   e-Publishing web site.
      7.6.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 4348 must be signed IAW guidance in this
      section. The signature on a computer-generated AF Form 4348 certifies:
          7.6.6.1.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
          certifying official.
          7.6.6.1.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
          proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-
          generated AF Form 4348.
   7.6.7. Unit Supplement. Describe unit AF Form 4348 procedures/program. Include a list of
   certifications applicable to the unit with appropriate source documents and designated
   certifying officials. Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 4348
   are also included in ARMS. Annotate if someone other than the Chief of OGV/squadron
   Stan/Eval has been authorized by the SQ/CC to sign the last line of an AF Form 4348 to
   signify transcription accuracy.
7.7. AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. The AF Form 942 is an index providing pertinent
information extracted from all the AF Forms 8/8a accomplished by the aircrew member. See
example at Attachment 5.
   7.7.1. Data Entry.
      7.7.1.1. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation,
      “INSTR”), use upper and lower case letters.
      7.7.1.2. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
      data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
      desired.
      7.7.1.3. A one-line entry is used for all evaluations with the exception of those in which
      the qualification levels awarded on portions of a combined evaluation are not all the
      same.
      7.7.1.4. For combined evaluations in which different qualification levels are awarded for
      any of the portions, a single line entry will be made for each different qualification level
      awarded indicating which portions of the combined evaluation received that qualification
      level.
      7.7.1.5. Use each AF Form 942 until it is completely filled. If additional blocks not
      needed, “Z” out any unused blocks.
   7.7.2. Type Aircraft/Crew Position. Enter MDS used and crew position flown during the
   evaluation as it appears in the Aircraft/Crew Position area under Examinee Identification of
   the subject AF Form 8/8a. For AF Form 8a, enter first aircraft.

   7.7.3. Type of Evaluation. Enter type of evaluation (or applicable portions of a combined
   evaluation in which different qualification levels were awarded to different portions - see
   paragraph 7.3.5.3.2.1) as it appears in the Mission/Check area under Flight Phase of the
   subject AF Form 8/8a. If the evaluation did not include a flight phase, enter type of
   evaluation as it appears in the Examination/Check area under Ground Phase of the subject
   AF Form 8/8a.
   7.7.4. Date Completed. Enter date from the Date Completed block of the subject AF Form
   8/8a.
   7.7.5. Qualification Level. Enter the appropriate qualification level as it appears on the
   subject AF Form 8/8a.
   7.7.6. MAJCOM Change. A one-line, undated entry containing MAJCOM title will be
   made for each change in the individual’s MAJCOM based on a Permanent Change of Station
   (PCS)/Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA). Do not annotate a change of MAJCOM if
   the individual is receiving an evaluation from an evaluator in a different MAJCOM unless
   the individual is enrolled in a formal training program.
   7.7.7. Computer Generated AF Form 942. A computer generated AF Form 942 may be
   used as long as cumulative entries are retained. Electronic copies of the AF Form 942 should
   be forwarded with the FEF when the individual moves to a new squadron.
7.8. Flight Evaluation Folders (FEF). The FEF contains the source documents that constitute
the history of flying qualifications for each aircrew member.
7.8. (433AW)Flight Evaluation Folders (FEF). FEFs will be created and maintained in
accordance with the FEF program guide. FEFs will be maintained by squadron DOV.
   7.8.1. Maintenance.
      7.8.1.1. Each aircrew member who is on flying status must have a FEF that includes all
      AF Forms 8/8a, AF Forms 942, AF Forms 4348 (if used), and any additional MAJCOM
      and/or unit specified items. EXCEPTION: for flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-
      rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification do not require an
      FEF, documentation will be IAW paragraph 8.1.
      7.8.1.2. The FEF must be maintained by a Stan/Eval functional office - normally in the
      organization to which the individual is assigned or attached for flying.
      7.8.1.3. HHQ personnel on active flying status may have their FEFs maintained by the
      Stan/Eval function of the unit to which they are attached for flying.
      7.8.1.4. For personnel on inactive flying status, the FEF will be maintained with their
      Flight Records Folder (FRF).
      7.8.1.5. Individuals assigned or attached to other than USAF units may use the format of
      the service to which they are attached to document their history of qualifications.
   7.8.2. Electronic FEFs.
      7.8.2.1. For electronic FEFs, any hard copy historical information (once incorporated
      into the electronic FEF system) will be archived with the Stan/Eval function that
      maintains the FEFs. Archive method will be at unit discretion.
AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013                                                      55


     7.8.2.2. Scanned versions of historical documents will be saved IAW AFI 33-364,
     Records Disposition—Procedures and Responsibilities.
     7.8.2.3. Electronic FEF systems must be able to produce hard copies of FEF products,
     when needed, consistent with the guidance in this AFI. Additionally, the electronic FEF
     must be transportable.
  7.8.3. Contents. Divide the FEF into two sections:
     7.8.3.1. (left side). This Section contains AF Forms 942, AF Forms 4348 (if used), and
     any items authorized by the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement. Section I may contain
     two sub-sections.
         7.8.3.1.1. AF Forms 942 will be placed on top in chronological order with the most
         recent on top, followed by the AF Form 4348 (if used).
         7.8.3.1.2. Any additional information as directed by MAJCOM and/or unit
         supplement will be placed under the AF Form 942 and 4348 (if used).
         7.8.3.1.3. If the FEF is not maintained at the same base with the individual’s FRF, a
         copy of the most recent AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or
         Special Operational Duty, and AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training
         Record, may be filed in this section behind and MAJCOM and/or unit directed items.
     7.8.3.2. (right side). This Section contains AF Forms 8/8a and any related MFRs for all
     evaluations listed on the AF Form 942.
         7.8.3.2.1. AF Forms 8/8a. File AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order with the most
         recent on top. Individuals who maintain qualification in two or more MDSs or two or
         more crew positions in the same MDS will file AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order
         – without consideration of MDS or crew position.
         7.8.3.2.2. MFRs.
            7.8.3.2.2.1. MFRs documenting waivers, extensions, and/or unusual
            circumstances to potentially be included in an AF Form 8/8a are filed on top of
            the affected AF Form 8/8a.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.1. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the
                applicable AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional
                Comments, when action is complete.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.2. Once MFR information is incorporated onto the AF Form 8/8a,
                remove the MFR from the FEF.
            7.8.3.2.2.2. Expiration Date Extensions (see also paragraph 5.8.3.2).
                7.8.3.2.2.2.1. On the expiration date extension MFR specify extension
                authority, the new expiration date, and a brief description of the extension.
                7.8.3.2.2.2.2. MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any affected
                periodic evaluation.
            7.8.3.2.2.3. Permanent MFRs. MFRs become a permanent part of the FEF only
            when a Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by
56                                         AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013


            a later Form 8 (see paragraph 7.8.6.1) or an unusual circumstance cannot be
            documented any other way.
  7.8.4. Hard-Copy Folders.
     7.8.4.1. Folders must be letter size, able to separate contents into two sections and
     constructed of heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).
     7.8.4.2. Standard 2 ¾-inch metal fasteners may be used.
     7.8.4.3. Affix a label bearing the individual’s name and last four of SSN to the inside
     back cover so that the folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information
     on the label if required by MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
     7.8.4.4. Folders must bear the “For Official Use Only” label/stamp on both sides of the
     FEF.
  7.8.5. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
  and how to implement the periodic review of FEFs.
     7.8.5.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
     aircrew members to verify their qualification(s) (and certifications on AF Form 4348 if
     used) prior to their first flight.
        7.8.5.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the qualification
        of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable documentation in
        Sections I and II of the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.2. Following the initial review, the unit maintaining the FEF is responsible
        only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.3. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
        Stan/Eval function at the unit/squadron to which they are attached to fly, the
        Stan/Eval function of that unit/squadron will also review the FEF prior to their first
        flight.
     7.8.5.2. Posting Review.
        7.8.5.2.1. The Stan/Eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a and AF Forms
        4348 (if used) when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and completeness.
        7.8.5.2.2. The Form 8/8a review will confirm that the eligibility period and
        qualification as documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events and
        requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that all signatures and
        initials are obtained within the allotted time (see paragraph 7.3.8.5).
        7.8.5.2.3. The AF Form 4348 (if used) will be reviewed for correct certification
        signature and to ensure all previous entries are accurate and accounted for.
        7.8.5.2.4. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM supplement.
     7.8.5.3. Periodic Review.
        7.8.5.3.1. The Stan/Eval function will review all applicable FEFs to confirm
        expiration dates used to track required aircrew qualification evaluations are the same
AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013                                                        57


        as those listed in the FEFs. Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is
        not required.
        7.8.5.3.2. The interval between reviews will not exceed the standard qualification
        period window unless a more restrictive review period is established by the
        MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.3. Document the periodic review IAW MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
  7.8.6. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8/8a, AF
  Forms 4348 (if used), AF Form 942, and any MAJCOM-directed documentation.
     7.8.6.1. Major Discrepancies. Discrepancies that affect the qualification of the affected
     aircrew member.
        7.8.6.1.1. Major discrepancies are documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section
        I or II immediately above the affected AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348 (if used), or in
        chronological order for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348
        (if used).
        7.8.6.1.2. MFRs documenting similar major discrepancies found on multiple AF
        Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
     7.8.6.2. Minor Discrepancies. Discrepancies that do not affect the qualification (and/or
     certifications if using the AF Form 4348) of the affected aircrew member (e.g. typos,
     formatting and misspellings).
        7.8.6.2.1. Minor discrepancies are documented on a non-permanent record as defined
        by the MAJCOM or unit supplement to this instruction and need not reside in the
        FEF.
            7.8.6.2.1.1. (Added-433AW) Minor discrepancy logs will be maintained in
            individual FEFs as detailed in the FEF program guide.
     7.8.6.3. Corrections.
        7.8.6.3.1. AF Form 8/8a. As a source document, the AF Form 8/8a may be
        corrected by use of white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document
        provided the flight examiner signing Section III of the form initials the correction. If
        the original FE is not available then document the discrepancy IAW paragraphs
        7.8.6.1 or 7.8.6.2. When the original FE is not available, OGV Chiefs may also
        correct minor discrepancies as prescribed in MAJCOM supplements.
        7.8.6.3.2. AF Form 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be altered
        without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected aircrew member and the
        contents of the FEF.
        7.8.6.3.3. AF Form 4348 (if used). AF Forms 4348 may be corrected by use of
        white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document provided the certifying
        official signing that line of the AF Form 4348 initials the correction. For significant
        corrections that alter the certification’s intent, make a new AF Form 4348 entry.
58                                          AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013


         7.8.6.3.4. Electronic Corrections. If the system used to store the record does not
         allow corrections to be made, then document the discrepancy IAW paragraph 7.8.6.1
         and/or paragraph 7.8.6.2.
  7.8.7. Transfer of FEF.
     7.8.7.1. Retention of Records. Retain all records in the FEF until reviewed by the
     gaining unit. After review, return to the individual those forms not retained in the FEF.
     7.8.7.2. Formal Training Graduates. For Formal Training School graduates reporting
     directly to an overseas command for a short tour, retain formal training school records for
     transfer to the subsequent gaining unit.
     7.8.7.3. PCS of Individual. Aircrew members will normally hand-carry their FEF along
     with their FRF to the gaining organization.
     7.8.7.3. (433AW) When an individual outprocesses, squadron DOV will place a copy of
     the current Letter of X’s in the member’s FEF prior to signing the FEF out to the
     member.
         7.8.7.3.1. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail the
         folder to the gaining unit via registered mail.
         7.8.7.3.2. Mail any records not included in the FEF to the gaining organization with
         clear identification of the individual concerned.
         7.8.7.3.3. When mailing an FEF or any of its contents, retain a copy (hard or soft
         copy is acceptable) until the gaining organization has received the original FEF.
  7.8.8. Disposition of FEF.
     7.8.8.1. Dispose of the aircrew FEF according to the Air Force Records Disposition
     Schedule (RDS) and Air Force guidance concerning the protection of Personally
     Identifiable Information.
     7.8.8.2. Outdated certification documents, ARMS products, medical recommendations
     and miscellaneous documentation identified during reviews will be returned to the
     aircrew member for disposal.
AFI11-202V2_433AWSUP_I 28 AUGUST 2013                                                       59

                                SPECIALIZED AIRCREW

8.1. Purpose. This chapter provides additional guidance pertaining to flight surgeons and non-
rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification.
   8.1.1. Initial and periodic qualification consists of a written (open or closed book)
   examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion of the examination,
   members will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal qualification).
   8.1.1. (433AW) Flying squadron DOV/scheduling office will forward copies of all flight
   surgeon test certificates to OGV for inclusion in the testing log.
   8.1.2. MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and/or MDS-Specific
   qualification requirements.
   8.1.3. Qualification requirements will be documented on an AF Form 1522, ARMS
   Additional Training Accomplishment Report, and stored in ARMS in the Formal Training
   module with currency tracked in the Training module. No AF Form 8/8a or FEF is required;
   however, the Stan/Eval function of the unit to which specialized aircrew are
   assigned/attached for flying will verify that ARMS information is logged appropriately.
   When MAJCOMs or subordinate units require a flight phase, or if directed by the applicable
   MDS-Specific Volume 2, document IAW Chapter 7 (to include creating an FEF).
8.2. Evaluations. Initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required) examinations are considered
QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this AFI, but may be prescribed in
MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
   8.2.1. Flight Surgeons. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by AFMOA/SG3P.
   8.2.2. DELETED.
   8.2.3. Non-Rated Aircrew Members. Test questions will come from the lead MAJCOM
   Master Question Files (MQFs).

       ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS (FCIF, SII, GO/NO-GO, SUPPLEMENTARY
                          EVALUATIONS)

9.1. FCIF.
   9.1.1. Units will establish and maintain a library consisting of a current read file and
   publications. This library will consist of the items listed in Table 9.1 in either hardcopy or
   electronic format. If a unit establishes a paper library, it will be organized into volumes as
   shown in the table.
   9.1.1. (433AW) The FCIF library will be maintained in accordance with the FCIF program
   guide.
   9.1.2. FCIFs may be issued to alert crewmembers to publications changes for TOs or AFIs
   that affect aircraft operations, but actual publication changes must be accomplished IAW
   established procedural guidance, to include AFI 33-360 (as applicable) and TO 00-5-1.
      9.1.2.1. MAJCOMs will advise user commands when releasing an FCIF item that affects
      a weapon system. FCIF items that affect weapon systems will include designated
      MAJCOM applicability.
      9.1.2.2. FCIF items that contain weapon system data will be controlled IAW the
      applicable distribution statement in the governing Technical Order (TO).
   9.1.3. Required Volumes. Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current read
   file items, Volumes II through IV are made up of publications and flight manuals, and
   Volume V (optional) is reserved for flight safety information. If units choose hardcopy
   format and the contents of any volume exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional
   binder and identify the first and subsequent binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB).

      through V.
      9.1.4.2. Part B is the Current Read File of FCIF messages. Messages contain information
      temporary in nature, directly pertinent to the safe conduct of flight, and must be read
      before flight. FCIFs that contain aircraft-related information will be forwarded to all
      using MAJCOMs.
      9.1.4.2. (433AW) Aircrew members will document review of required FCIF items
      before flight by signing off all FCIFs using Patriot Excalibur (PEX). If PEX is
      unavailable, aircrew members will record the most recent FCIF number reviewed on the
      flight authorization next to their name. Aircraft commanders/medical crew directors
      (MCD)s will ensure all aircrew members sign-off FCIFs prior to flight.
      9.1.4.3. Part C is the Current Read File that contains information temporary in nature but
      not related to the safe conduct of flight and not required to be read before flight.
         9.1.4.3.1. (Added-433AW) The 433 AW Flight Crew Bulletin (FCB) is separated
         into four parts. Part 1 contains items applicable to all aircrew members. Part 2A
         contains C-5 items published quarterly by AMC. Part 2B contains items deemed
         applicable to C-5 aircrew members by OGV. Part 3 contains items applicable to
         AECMs. C-5 mission kits will contain parts 1, 2A and 2B. AECM mission kits will
         contain parts 1 and 3.
      9.1.4.4. Squadrons with both primary crewmembers and mission crewmembers may use
      separate sections in Volume I for mission crewmembers. In addition, these squadrons are
      exempt from the requirement to maintain mission crewmember checklist and aircrew aids
      in the FCIF volumes.
      9.1.4.5. Refer to Attachment 7 for a sample FCIF format.
   9.1.5. Publications Library. Volumes II through IV will consist of an FCIF Functional
   Publications Library according to MAJCOM directives. See AFI 33-360 for basic library
   requirements.
