                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Overview. This publication is intended to provide an overview of how AFRC conducts its
flying training program and to serve as a reference for other governing publications. It describes
organizational structure and command authority and the purpose of, responsibilities for and
processes for managing AFRC’s flying training program.
1.2. Department of Defense (DoD) organization. The DoD is the executive agency charged
with maintaining national security. It is administratively organized into service components for
the purpose of organizing, training and equipping military forces, and functionally organized into
Unified Combatant Commands (UCCs) for the purpose of employing those forces to accomplish
national goals.
   1.2.1. UCCs. The DoD’s war-fighting capability is distributed among nine joint (multi-
   service) UCCs to exercise command of U.S. military forces in their assigned geographic or
   functional areas of responsibility (AORs).
   1.2.2. Air Force component commands. Air Force component commands are the service
   components of the UCCs. Like the UCCs, they are organized geographically or functionally.
   1.2.3. Major commands (MAJCOMs). The Air Force is organized into eight functional and
   two geographic MAJCOMs. Six of the ten MAJCOMs also serve as Air Force component
   commands.
   1.2.4. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). AFRC is the Air Force MAJCOM responsible
   for organizing, training and equipping Air Force reservists to perform assigned wartime and
   peacetime missions.
   1.2.5. Air Force lead commands. MAJCOMs designated to advocate for and manage
   identified weapon system(s) are referred to as lead commands for those system(s). Air
   Combat Command (ACC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), and Air Force Special
   Operations Command (AFSOC) are lead commands for weapons systems which are assigned
   to AFRC as a “using” command. Lead commands are identified in AFPD 10-9, Lead
   Command Designation and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems.
1.3. Command authority. MAJCOMs exercise administrative control (ADCON) to organize,
train and equip forces. UCCs exercise operational control (OPCON) and tactical control
(TACON) to execute their war-fighting missions.

                                             Chapter 2

                            AFRC FLYING TRAINING PROGRAM

2.1. AFRC training missions. Insofar as the mission of AFRC is to organize, train and equip
Air Force Reservists to support DoD requirements, the primary purpose of flights conducted
under ADCON authority of AFRC is aircrew training. Some training missions also serve a
secondary, or collateral, purpose such as providing airlift, mission orientation or community
relations.
2.2. Training mission approval. All AFRC training missions must be approved prior to flight.
Mission approval consists of approving both the itinerary and mission purpose(s). The approval
authorities and processes for various mission types are listed below.
     2.2.1. Local training missions. Local training missions are those which originate and
     terminate at home station and which transit only local training airfields. A local training
     airfield is a civilian or military airfield in proximity to a flying unit’s home station used for
     aircrew training because of airspace restrictions, traffic saturation, or facility limitations at
     the home station. The operations group commander (OG/CC) may designate an airfield as a
     local training airfield if it is suitable for the aircraft MDS in the Airfield Suitability and
     Restrictions Report (ASRR) and has adequate crash/fire rescue services IAW AFPAM 32-
     2004, Aircraft Fire Protection for Military Operations Other Than War. Waivers will not be
     issued to qualify an otherwise unsuitable airfield for use as a local training airfield. Note:
     The OG/CC will forward the list of designated local training airfields along with the selection
     rationale to AFRC Force Generation Center, Forces Division (FGC/FGO). Lists will be
     updated annually or as required to accommodate changes in airspace or facilities utilization.
        2.2.1.1. Passengers and cargo. AFRC units may transport unit personnel and equipment
        to/from approved local training airfields only if the transportation is in support of the
        training mission (e.g., drop zone/landing zone support personnel or equipment).
        Missions which transport other than mission support personnel and cargo to a local
        training base will be approved IAW the procedures for Off-Station Training (OST)
        missions.
        2.2.1.2. Mission approval. OG/CC is approval authority for local training missions.
     2.2.2. OST missions. OST missions are those training missions which transit other than
     home station or a designated local training airfield for the purpose of conducting enroute
     training (aeromedical evacuation, inflight refueling), destination training (JA/ATTs,
     exercises) or a secondary mission (airlift, aerial events).
        2.2.2.1. Mission approval. AFRC FGC/FGO is approval authority for OST missions
        except as noted below. Note: Any flight requiring HQ AFRC approval must first be
        approved by the wing commander. Any flight requiring AFRC/CC or /CV approval,
        must also be approved by the Numbered Air Force commander (NAF/CC).
            2.2.2.1.1. Orientation flights. Orientation flights are approved at command levels
            from the wing commander up through AFRC/CC IAW AFI 11-401, AFRC Sup,
            Aviation Management.
AFRCI11-201 25 OCTOBER 2012                                                                      7


          2.2.2.1.2. Aerial events. Event and participation approval authorities for aerial
          events, including funeral and memorial flyovers, are listed in AFI 11-
          209_AFRCSUP, Attachment 2, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures.
          2.2.2.1.3. Public Affairs airlift. Participation approval authorities (event approval)
          and operational approval authorities (unit approval) for the flight are listed in AFI 35-
          103, Public Affairs Travel, AFI 35-104, Media Operations and AFI 35-105,
          Community Relations.
2.3. Approval documentation. Local training mission are documented IAW published wing
procedures. Missions which are approved by HQ AFRC FGC/FGO, AFRC/A3 or AFRC/A3O
must be entered into the Single Mobility System (SMS) for approval. Missions which are
approved by AFRC/CC or /CV and those missions outside SMS capabilities (orientation flights)
require an electronic Staff Summary Sheet (e-SSS) in addition to the SMS worksheet.
2.4. Single Mobility System (SMS). SMS is a web-based software application developed by
USTRANSCOM to manage cargo and passenger movement and provide visibility of Mobility
Air Forces (MAF) assets. AFRC also uses SMS for developing and allocating organic airlift
requirements and for providing visibility of MAF and Combat Air Forces (CAF) OST missions.
   2.4.1. Securing an SMS account. A “read only” SMS account can be obtained at the SMS
   website https://sms.transcom.mil/sms by selecting the “Get an Account” button and
   following the instructions. The additional privileges listed below can be obtained by sending
   a request to afrc/a3oo@us.af.mil through the wing SMS POC.
       2.4.1.1. Unit scheduler privileges. Unit scheduler privileges allow the SMS account
       holder to enter, edit and delete mission itineraries in SMS for HQ AFRC approval.
       2.4.1.2. Wing commander privileges. Wing commander approval authority allows the
       SMS account holder to exercise proxy mission approval authority under written
       delegation from the wing commander.
       2.4.1.3. Requirements-maker privileges. Requirements-maker privileges allow the SMS
       account holder to enter deployment requests into SMS for validation and DRB approval
       IAW AFRCI 10-204, AFR Exercise and Deployment Program.
   2.4.2. Mission setup sheets. All OSTs and all training missions having a secondary mission
   purpose (e.g., aerial events, community relations flights) must be submitted on an SMS
   mission setup worksheet for HQ AFRC approval. The mission setup worksheet consists of
   identifying information (unit, MDS, aircrew), mission itinerary and comments blocks for
   entering the mission narrative, training events, secondary mission purpose, aircraft security
   arrangements, coordinating comments and verbatim Global Decision Support System
   (GDSS) remarks. Upon request, AFRC FGC/FGO will provide a guide for completing the
   SMS setup worksheet.
       2.4.2.1. Extended ground time. Ground time in excess of 24 hours must be justified by
       circumstances (e.g., static load training, body clock adjustment, field operating
       restrictions, upload requirements, etc.) and explained in the mission narrative of the SMS
       setup sheet.
       2.4.2.2. Use of civilian airfields. Military airfields will normally be utilized as remain
       overnight (RON) locations. Requests to use a civilian airfield for RON must be justified
 8                                                            AFRCI11-201 25 OCTOBER 2012


        in the mission narrative, and aircraft security arrangements, to include the name and
        contact information for security POC at the civilian airfield, must be described in the
        aircraft security block.
        2.4.2.3. Electronic SSS (e-SSS). If a supplementary e-SSS is required, it must be
        submitted in the Task Management Tool (TMT) through the NAF to HQ AFRC.
     2.4.3. Mission Identifiers (MIs).
        2.4.3.1. Mobility Air Forces (MAF) MIs. Every MAF mission has a unique 12-digit
        alpha-numeric MI constructed IAW AMC’s Mission ID Encode/Decode Tables. SMS
        software incorporates the Encode/Decode Tables to auto-generate MIs for most MAF
        missions when the mission data is entered. For any mission for which an MI is not auto-
        generated (AMC or contingency support, JA/ATT, etc.), the MI must be obtained from
        the mission management authority and manually entered.
        2.4.3.2. Combat Air Forces (CAF) MIs. The AMC Encode/Decode Tables do not
        include CAF aircraft; however, logic was added to the SMS software to auto-generate
        MIs for AFRC CAF OST missions.
     2.4.4. Approval lead time. To allow adequate time for review, routine mission requests must
     be submitted to AFRC FGC/FGO or AFRC/A3OO IAW the pre-departure lead times below.
     The reasons for submitting requests inside these timelines must be justified in the mission
     narrative portion of the SMS setup sheet or e-SSS.
        2.4.4.1. If AFRC FGC/FGO or AFRC/A3OO is the approval authority, 72 hours;
        2.4.4.2. If AFRC/A3 is the approval authority, 7 days;
        2.4.4.3. If AFRC/CC or AFRC/CV is the approval authority, 21 days;
        2.4.4.4. If AF or DoD is the approval authority, 45 days.
        2.4.4.5. Emergency response missions can be approved by contacting Battle Watch at
        any time. Note: The above timelines assume that the SMS setup sheets and e-SSSs are
        complete (mission itinerary, training events, passenger and/or cargo validations, and
        mission purpose), do not require collateral approvals [(non-standard procedures, waivers,
        Threat Working Group (TWG)] and have been properly coordinated and approved at the
        wing. Note: AFRC/PA is responsible for establishing timelines for submission of
        requests for Public Affairs events.
2.5. Passenger and cargo validation. All passengers and cargo must be validated for
transportation on AFRC aircraft.
     2.5.1. Passenger validation.
        2.5.1.1. Duty passengers. Duty passengers are those military or civilian personnel on
        official orders who have been directed or authorized to travel via military airlift (MilAir).
        Validation of duty passengers is the responsibility of the command or agency to which
        the passengers are assigned. AFRC duty passengers are validated for travel IAW AFRCI
        10-204, Air Force Reserve Exercise and Deployment Program.
        2.5.1.2. Non-duty passengers. Non-duty passengers are those who, although not directed
        to travel, are permitted to travel on DoD aircraft IAW DoD 4515.13R, Air Transportation
AFRCI11-201 25 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 9


     Eligibility. Non-duty passengers are validated by the passenger terminal, or, if no
     passenger terminal is available, by the command providing the airlift. Unless otherwise
     specified in DoD or Air Force publications, HQ AFRC/A4OP validates non-duty
     passengers on AFRC aircraft.
  2.5.2. Cargo validation. Cargo on AFRC aircraft may be transported as revenue airlift, non-
  revenue airlift (NRA) or AFRC organic airlift.
     2.5.2.1. Revenue airlift. Revenue (airlift) cargo is funded for shipment IAW the
     Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) and validated for shipment by the
     command or service to which it is assigned. Transportation of TWCF cargo is described
     in chapter 5.
     2.5.2.2. Non-revenue airlift (NRA). NRA cargo is that which is transported on a space-
     available (“space-A") basis as a byproduct of airlift training at no cost to the owning
     agency. NRA cargo is validated for shipment by the command or service to which it is
     assigned; however, as part of the validation process, USTRANSCOM must verify that
     command/service does not have funds to transport the cargo under TWCF.
         2.5.2.2.1. Opportune airlift. Opportune airlift is the NRA of low priority cargo
         between AMC cargo ports. Opportune airlift missions can be scheduled through the
         Trader Board in SMS or by contacting the base Air Terminal Operations Center
         (ATOC).
         2.5.2.2.2. Denton Program airlift. Denton Program airlift is a special category of
         NRA established under the Denton Transportation Authority, 10 U.S.C. Section 402,
         to transport privately donated humanitarian cargo to foreign countries. Denton cargo
         is validated by Joint Relief International, Inc. (JRI), also known as “the Denton
         Office,” in association with USTRANSCOM.
         2.5.2.2.3. Counterdrug (CD) airlift. CD is NRA of passengers and cargo in support
         of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (USDEA) or other similar civilian law
         enforcement agency IAW AFI 10-801, Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement
         Agencies. CD missions are validated by the owning command/service in association
         with HQ AFRC/A3OH.
     2.5.2.3. Operational Support Airlift (OSA). OSA is a type of NRA conducted within the
     CONUS to transport high-priority passengers and cargo with time, place, or mission-
     sensitive requirements IAW DoD Directive (DoDD) 4500.56, DoD Policy on the Use of
     Government Aircraft and Air Travel. Note: OSA is normally accomplished using aircraft
     specifically designated for that purpose under the mission management authority of the
     Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC) at USTRANSCOM; however, if OSA
     requirements exceed the capacity of available OSA-designated aircraft AFRC units may
     volunteer to airlift OSA passengers on training missions.
     2.5.2.4. Organic airlift. Organic airlift is the transportation of cargo assigned to AFRC
     on AFRC aircraft. Refer to AFRCI 10-204 for cargo validation procedures.
     2.5.2.5. Public Affairs (PA) missions. PA (community relations) missions are those
     which transport media representatives, employers, community leaders and/or
     congressional members and their staffs for the purpose of furthering their understanding
 10                                                       AFRCI11-201 25 OCTOBER 2012


       of the roles and missions of AFRC, the Air Force and the DoD. Note: AFRC/PA is
       responsible for establishing the request format and approval timelines for participation
       approval of PA missions.
       2.5.2.6. Orientation flights. Orientation flights are conducted to reward exemplary
       conduct, to familiarize individuals with USAF aircraft and missions, and to familiarize
       military spouses with unit aircraft and missions IAW AFI 11-401.
       2.5.2.7. Aerial events. Aerial events are displays of military equipment and/or
       capabilities for community relations or military ceremonial purposes. Note: A list of
       approved aerial events can be found on the Secretary of the Air Force, Public Affairs
       (SAF/PA) Aerial Events Support website.
          2.5.2.7.1. Funeral and memorial flyovers. Funeral/memorial flyovers are aerial
          events conducted to honor certain deceased military members. Procedures for
          validating eligibility and requesting memorial flyovers are governed by AFI 34-242,
          Mortuary Affairs Program. Note: If an aerial event, an orientation flight or a PA
          mission which has been approved by another MAJCOM is subsequently assigned to
          an associate AFRC unit, HQ AFRC approval can be expedited by forwarding
          documentation of MAJCOM approval to AFRC/A3OO.
2.6. Outside Continental U. S. (OCONUS) training missions. HQ AFRC has limited ability
to support OCONUS training missions for airlift and tanker aircraft. Responsibility for mission
planning, aircraft maintenance and aircraft security, which would be provided by AMC if
performing an OCONUS TWCF mission, devolve to the aircrew and the parent wing.
   2.6.1. Mission planning. HQ AFRC does not currently provide Integrated Flight
   Management (IFM) and routine diplomatic clearance (“Dip”) support for AFRC OCONUS
   missions. 618 AOC will provide this support to AFRC airlift and tanker aircrews on an “as
   able” basis; however, aircrews must be prepared to plan the mission and secure diplomatic
   clearances.
   2.6.2. Threat Working Group (TWG). Approval of the HQ AFRC TWG is required for any
   missions transiting an OCONUS installation at which U.S. or allied military forces do not
   provide aircraft security. Procedures for submitting a deployed risk assessment (DRA) for
   TWG approval are contained in chapter 8.
   2.6.3. Aircraft maintenance. Unit-equipped (UE) parent wings are responsible for
   supporting non-mission capable (NMC) aircraft at OCONUS locations by providing
   Maintenance Recovery Teams (MRTs). Associate aircraft, including those performing
   AFRC missions, will be supported by the AMC enroute support structure. Parts support will
   be provided by the Supply Management Activity Group (SMAG) IAW AFMAN 23-110. UE
   C-17 and C-5 aircraft at AMC OCONUS Forward Supply Locations (FSLs) will be
   supported IAW AMCI 21-108, Logistics Support Operations.
   2.6.4. Cargo ports. Whenever possible, OCONUS airlift missions should be planned to
   transit AMC cargo ports and accept available opportune cargo and passengers IAW AMCI
   11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations. Note: Aircrews flying OCONUS training missions must
   be aware that AFRC training (“Q”) missions have no priority for limited ramp space at
   OCONUS airfields. Even when prior permission (PPR) has been issued, it may be cancelled
   because aircraft on (higher) priority missions exhaust the Maximum on Ground (MOG)
AFRCI11-201 25 OCTOBER 2012                                                              11


  limits. Aircrews operating on a training MI should actively ensure that planned ramp space
  is available and previously approved PPRs remain valid.

                                           Chapter 4

                               AFRC MISSION EXECUTION

4.1. Mission management authority. AFRC exercises command and control (C2) of AFRC
OST training missions, aerial events, PA missions, certain orientation missions, JA/ATT
missions, tanker Business Efforts (BEs) and test missions under its ADCON authority.
4.2. C2 systems. C2 encompasses the systems, processes and personnel by means of which
command authority is exercised over assigned and attached aviation forces. C2 of most AFRC
missions is exercised through parent wing command posts (CPs). C2 over RAS and similar
command-directed missions is exercised through the AFRC command center which also
functions as proxy C2 agent for AFRC missions when the parent wing CP is not manned.
4.3. Mission monitoring system. GDSS is used to monitor AFRC mission execution. Missions
are entered into GDSS either by the mission approval authority “pushing” the mission from SMS
or by the mission planner entering the mission directly into GDSS. Missions approved less than
24 hours prior to scheduled departure must be manually entered into GDSS by the mission
planner. Note: AFRC FGC/FGO or AFRC/A3OO should be contacted to expedite approval of
missions which were input into SMS or for which the itinerary has been changed within 24 hours
prior to scheduled departure. Note: Mission approval is rendered invalid if the itinerary entered
into GDSS is not identical to that approved in SMS.
4.4. Opening the mission. Opening the mission requires entry of the aircrew data and aircraft
tail number into GDSS. Because the AFRC command center cannot access this information, the
wing, squadron, or maintenance operations center or the CP typically opens a mission by
entering the required information into GDSS.
4.5. Mission reporting. Mission reporting requirements are described in chapter 10.
4.6. Enroute force protection. The AC must ensure force protection measures comply with 11-
2MDS, Volume 3, Chapter 7, or AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and comply with any threat
mitigation recommendations issued by the AFRC TWG for OCONUS missions.
4.7. Enroute itinerary changes. Planned changes in the itinerary of OST missions in execution
must be approved in advance by AFRC FGC/FGO and entered into GDSS by the parent wing CP
or the AFRC command center. Unplanned changes caused by weather, maintenance or other
problems should be reported to the C2 agency and entered into GDSS as soon as possible.
4.8. Non-mission capable (NMC) aircraft.
   4.8.1. Report NMC aircraft IAW chapter 10.
   4.8.2. In the event that an NMC aircraft performing an AFRC mission cannot be returned to
   service within the aircrew’s SRT, the OG/CC may authorize the aircrew to leave the aircraft
   and return to home station. Before departing the aircraft location, the AC must arrange for
   aircraft security pending arrival of the MRT and inform the C2 agency of the aircrew’s
   planned return to home station.
   4.8.3. Except as listed below, AFRC wings are responsible for recovering aircraft that
   become NMC away from home station. If requested, AFRC FGC/FGO will assist in
AFRCI11-201 25 OCTOBER 2012                                                                  17


   sourcing airlift of parts and/or an MRT. The aircraft parts needed to repair NMC aircraft are
   provided/funded by the wing to which the aircraft is assigned.
   4.8.4. 618 AOC/XOCL will provide limited assistance to recover AMC associate NMC
   aircraft performing AFRC missions IAW AMCI 21-108. Parts support will be provided by
   the Supply Management Activity Group (SMAG) IAW AFMAN 23-110. If provided a fund
   cite by the parent wing, 618 AOC/XOCL will provide and/or transport an MRT and parts to
   recover AFRC UE transport and tanker aircraft. Note: JA/ATT missions are considered
   AMC missions for purposes of this paragraph.
4.9. Parts cannibalization. 618 AOC/XOCL may cannibalize parts from AMC aircraft
including those operated by an AFRC associate unit executing an AFRC mission IAW AMCI
21-108. However, unless the owning AFRC wing is activated/ mobilized, 618 AOC/XOCL may
not cannibalize parts from AFRC-assigned UE aircraft without AFRC/A3 approval.
Cannibalization requests should be referred to the AFRC command center which will coordinate
the request with the unit of assignment, AFRC/A4M and AFRC FGC/FGO before forwarding to
AFRC/A3 for approval.
4.10. Waiver requests. Requests to waive aircrew duty limits, aircraft operating procedures or
minimum equipment requirements must be initiated/accepted by the AC. Unless otherwise
specified or delegated to the OG/CC in AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 3, waiver authority is AFRC/A3.
After securing OG/CC concurrence, the AC will send the waiver request to the AFRC command
center which will execute the waiver checklist. Waivers involving associate aircraft will be
coordinated with the owning MAJCOM.           Note: Waivers will not be granted to conduct
training missions at operating gross weights greater than 50 percent above the weight bearing
capacity (WBC) published in the ASRR.
4.11. Closing the mission. The AC will close the mission within one hour of returning to home
station through the parent wing CP or the AFRC command center.

                               UCC MISSION MANAGEMENT

5.1. UCC missions. AFRC aircrews perform operational missions under the OPCON/TACON
authority of a UCC during mobilization or when voluntarily activated. AFRC flying units may
volunteer to perform steady-state/recurring airlift, air refueling, joint forces training, exercises
and disaster response/relief missions through the appropriate scheduling/C2 agency. Note:
AFRC wings should forward requests for aviation support received directly from other
MAJCOMs or agencies to AFRC FGC for appropriate referral.
5.2. Types of UCC missions.
   5.2.1. Channel missions and SAAMs. Channel missions SAAMs are revenue airlift (TWCF)
   missions executed under OPCON of USTRANSCOM and TACON of 618 AOC IAW AMCI
   11-206, Mobility Force Management, and AMCI 11-208. AFRC units wishing to support
   USTRANSCOM airlift requirements must call 618 AOC/XOBL with aircraft/aircrew
   availability.
   5.2.2. Air Refueling (AR) missions. AR missions are scheduled through 618 AOC’s Air
   Refueling Management System (ARMS) and executed IAW AMCI 11-206 and AMCI 11-
   208. Priority 1 and 2 ARs, and all Coronets are executed under TACON of 618 AOC with
   the exception of Operation Noble Eagle (ONE) missions, which are executed under TACON
   of the Combined Forces Air Component Commander (CFACC), Continental United States,
   North American Aerospace Defense Command (CONR NORAD). Business Efforts (BEs)
   and priority 3 through 5 training-support missions are executed under control of AFRC. AR
   mission requirements can be found in the ARMS portion of the Consolidated Air Mobility
   Planning System (CAMPS) website. AR mission priorities are listed in AFI 11-221, Air
   Refueling Management (KC-10 and KC-135) and CJCSI 4120.02B, Assignment of Movement
   and Mobility Priority.
   5.2.3. Dual-role missions. Dual-role missions provide air refueling while simultaneously
   transporting the unit’s cargo and/or personnel. AMCI 11-206 establishes minimum cargo
   requirements for KC-135 and KC-10 dual-role missions. If cargo movement is the primary
   purpose of the mission, a dedicated funded SAAM is required. Outside the contiguous 48
   states and Canada, dual-role missions are managed as Coronets and executed under control of
   the 2nd Aerial Delivery Group (2 ADG).
   5.2.4. Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT). JA/ATT missions consisting
   of airdrop, air land and aircraft load training, are allocated through 618 AOC’s JA/ATT
   process and executed under control of AFRC. The AFRC JA/ATT process is described in
   chapter 6.
   5.2.5. Exercises. Exercises are full-scale rehearsals of military maneuvers to enhance
   readiness and improve crisis response capabilities. Exercises may be executed either under
   control of AFRC, another MAJCOM or a UCC/Joint Forces Commander as directed in the
   Planning Order (PLANORD) or Execution Order (EXORD). Approval and reporting
   procedures for wings participating in named exercises are contained in AFRCI 10-204.

  Spill Cleanup and Recovery Operations. Note: DoD inter/intra-departmental aerial spray
  missions, which dispense actual pesticide but which are conducted for training rather than in
  response to a health emergency, are executed under ADCON authority of HQ AFRC IAW
  chapter 2.
  5.2.8. Search and Rescue (SAR). Civil SAR missions are conducted by the 920 RQW at
  Patrick AFB, FL, and the 943 RQG (920 RQW) at Davis Monthan AFB, AZ, using HC-130
  and HH-60 aircraft, and Guardian Angel ground teams, during/following distress situations,
  accidents and natural/man-made disasters to prevent/mitigate loss of life, or serious injury.
  Civil SAR missions in the CONUS are executed under the commander’s Immediate
  Response Authority and coordinated by the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC)
  IAW the National Search and Rescue Plan of the United States. During contingencies, when
  the Joint Personnel Recovery Center (JPRC) stands up, SAR missions in the CONUS AOR
  are executed under TACON of the AFNORTH JFACC.
  5.2.9. Weather reconnaissance. Weather reconnaissance and surveillance missions are
  conducted by the 403 WG at Keesler AFB, MS, using specially configured WC-130J aircraft
  to monitor tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and
  eastern Pacific Ocean and winter storms in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific
  Ocean. Weather reconnaissance and surveillance missions in support of the National
  Weather Service (NWS) are directed by the Chief, Aerial Reconnaissance Coordination, All
  Hurricanes (CARCAH), and executed under OPCON authority of CDRUSTRANSCOM and

         JOINT AIRBORNE/AIR TRANSPORTABILITY TRAINING (JA/ATT)

6.1. Overview. JA/ATT is a DoD joint training program designed to develop tactics and
increase proficiency in combat airlift/airdrop operations. Program objectives and procedures are
published in AMC OPORD 17-76, Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT).
6.2. Types of JA/ATT missions. JA/ATT missions involve the following types of training:
airdrop, assault landing, direct delivery (C-17), static-load, combat off-load, engine-running on-
/off-load, and joint development/certification of new equipment or procedures.
6.3. JA/ATT validation. AFRC FGC must validate JA/ATTs before AFRC units may perform
them.
6.4. Scheduling JA/ATTs. 618 AOC/XOBC publishes validated JA/ATT missions in the Joint
Management System (JMS) on the JA/ATT website. Units volunteer to perform the missions by
entering unit data in an open requirement. Issuance of a JA/ATT sequence number by 618
AOC/XOBC constitutes acceptance of the offer and authorization to perform the mission.
6.5. Drop Zone (DZ) survey. The AC must ensure the planned drop zone has a current survey
in the Zone Availability Report (ZAR) available through the JA/ATT website.
6.6. JA/ATT aerial events. If the JA/ATT is performed as part of an airshow or other aerial
event, participation approval for the aerial event must also be secured IAW AFI 11-209.
6.7. Mission changes and cancellations. Procedures for changing or canceling an existing
JA/ATT contract are contained in AMC OPORD 17-76.
6.8. AMC support for NMC aircraft. AMC will support repair and recovery of an NMC
aircraft performing a JA/ATT mission if the following statement appears in the Form 59
remarks, “For 618 AOC/XOCL: This is a validated AMC mission, reference JA/ATT Line #
_______.”
6.9. Exercises. If a JA/ATT is part of a named exercise, the supporting unit must complete the
deployment request form IAW AFRCI 10-204.
6.10. Unilateral airdrop training. Unilateral airdrop training, in which an AFRC airlift unit
drops only AFRC-assigned equipment and/or jumpers, does not fall under the JA/ATT program.
If the aircraft and equipment/jumpers are assigned to a single wing, the wing commander is the
approval authority for the mission. If the aircraft and equipment/jumpers are assigned to
different AFRC wings, AFRC FGC is the approval authority.
6.11. Foreign military parachutists. Foreign military parachutists are authorized to jump from
Air Force aircraft IAW AFI 11-410, Personnel Parachute Operations.
   6.11.1. Jump host responsibilities. The jump host which is sponsoring the foreign military
   parachutists is responsible for ensuring that they are qualified and authorized to perform
   parachute operations and for coordinating communications procedures prior to conducting
   the airdrop. Additional requirements may be contained in the JA/ATT OPORD or
   TASKORD.

                     RESERVE AIRLIFT SUPPORT (RAS) PROGRAM

7.1. Overview. The RAS Program is the process by which AFRC FGC schedules aircraft and
crews to support AFRC priority or short-notice organic airlift requirements. C-130 and KC-135
flying units are normally scheduled to provide RAS support at the quarterly AAPC but may be
tasked after the conference to support unfilled priority requirements.
7.2. Tour of duty. The RAS tour of duty runs from Friday to Friday.
7.3. RAS crew requirements. The crew requirements are as follows:
   7.3.1. C-130H: 2 pilots, 1 navigator, 1 engineer, 2 loadmasters, 1 crew chief
   7.3.2. C-130J:       2 pilots, 2 loadmasters, 1 crew chief
   7.3.3. KC-135: 2 pilots, 2 boom operators, 2 crew chiefs
7.4. Reimbursement. RPA Pay and allowances, travel and per diem for the personnel flying
the RAS are reimbursed to AFRC wings by HQ AFRC. Note: Wings will be reimbursed only
for the specified number of RAS personnel. Additional personnel in excess of stated
requirements are not reimbursed. If active associate personnel are assigned to fly on the RAS,
their travel and per diem costs are not reimbursed.
7.5. Aircraft configuration. Aircraft must be capable of being configured to accept passengers,
cargo, or Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) crews/equipment when departing home station. C-130
aircraft will have an operable winch. KC-135 aircraft will have two baggage bins and sufficient
rollers to support 3 pallet positions. KC-135 airline seats are not required unless specified in the
schedule.
7.6. Passenger and cargo validation. Passengers and cargo on RAS missions are validated as
described in chapter 2.
7.7. RAS schedules. AFRC FGC prioritizes and schedules airlift requirements for the RAS and
sends a schedule to the supporting wing current operations office. The schedule includes an
itinerary with departure and arrival times, a brief description of the amount and type of
passengers/cargo and the name and phone number of the airlift Point of Contact (POC).
Subsequent changes to the schedule changes will be sent to wing current operations prior to
departure or directly to the aircrew once the mission is in execution.
7.8. Mission planning. The AC is responsible for conducting all missions planning.
7.9. Call sign. The RAS call sign is “Cody 01.” Additional RAS aircraft operating
concurrently will be assigned “Cody 02” etc., as necessary.
7.10. Command and Control (C2). C2 of the RAS is exercised through the AFRC command
center. The command center will flight follow the mission, compile mission reports, input
mission data to GDSS, coordinate problem resolution and waiver requests, and provide other
assistance as required.
7.11. Mission execution. The aircrew will open the mission through the home station wing
command post and fly the scheduled itinerary. Aircrew-initiated itinerary deviations for reasons
 24                                                       AFRCI11-201 25 OCTOBER 2012


other than enroute weather or aircraft malfunctions must be approved by AFRC FGC prior to
execution.
7.12. Communications. To ensure timely communication of schedule changes or problems
with the aircraft, passengers/cargo, weather, crew rest/duty day, etc., the RAS AC will contact
the AFRC command center prior to departure from home station, prior to each day’s initial
mission leg, and at each enroute stop to update mission status and confirm the schedule. At
Remain Overnight (RON) locations, the AC will also provide billeting and telephone contact
information. The AC is responsible for contacting mission POCs when mission delays will
impact scheduled airlift.

                      HQ AFRC THREAT WORKING GROUP (TWG)

8.1. Overview. The AFRC TWG is a panel composed of representatives from Intelligence
(A2), the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), Security Forces (A7S) and Health Services (SG)
and chaired by the AFRC FGC/FGO. It is responsible for evaluating threats to the safety and
security of AFRC personnel and equipment deploying to locations outside the United States and
its possessions which do not have a U.S. or allied military presence as described below. AFRC
FGC is the OPR for the AFRC TWG.            Note: The AFRC TWG does not review deployments
to NATO, Canadian, Australian, New Zealander, and Japanese or South Korean military bases.
8.2. TWG meeting. The AFRC TWG meets weekly but may be convened as required for crisis
response or other short-notice missions. For aviation deployments, AFRC FGC/FGOE will
attend the AFRC TWG on behalf of the deployment sponsor/flying wing to present the
deployment plan.
8.3. Mission data. The deploying unit is responsible for submitting mission information to the
AFRC TWG sufficiently in advance of the deployment to permit the threat analysis to be
completed prior to the meeting. Because it depends on the likelihood of threats to personnel or
equipment and the potential difficulty of implementing any recommended countermeasures, the
lead time for submitting deployment plans to the TWG cannot be specified. The following
information must be submitted in slide format on the HQ AFRC/FGC/FGO SIPRNet SharePoint
site:
   8.3.1. Deploying unit designation
   8.3.2. Deployment dates
   8.3.3. Type and number of aircraft
   8.3.4. Number of personnel
   8.3.5. Purpose of mission
   8.3.6. Supported agency
   8.3.7. Itinerary
   8.3.8. Ground transportation and billeting arrangements, and
   8.3.9. Aircraft security arrangements
8.4. Deployed Risk Assessment (DRA). Based on the deployment information submitted by
the unit, the AFRC TWG will develop a DRA to identify threats and recommend
countermeasures.
   8.4.1. Threats. Possible threats include injury or damage caused by terrorist, criminal, or
   military forces; illness caused by food-, water-, or insect-borne diseases; and threats to U.S.
   interests from foreign intelligence activity.
   8.4.2. Countermeasures. Countermeasures include restrictions on deployment locations,
   ground transportation, lodging, diet, or personal contacts; and/or requirements for personal
   and/or aircraft protective equipment, aircraft tactical maneuvering, and/or physical
 26                                                          AFRCI11-201 25 OCTOBER 2012


   barriers/security enhancements, such as fencing, entry control points, and lighting, and/or the
   presence of security personnel, such as U.S. military, foreign military, local police or contract
   security.
8.5. Phoenix Raven Program. The Phoenix Raven Program provides enroute security for
AMC and AMC-gained aircrews and equipment transiting high threat areas. If on-site security at
a planned transit location is unknown or deemed inadequate, Phoenix Raven security personnel
will deploy in teams of two or four to perform airfield assessments and close-in aircraft security
IAW AMCI 31-104, Phoenix Raven Program.
   8.5.1. AMC/A7S maintains a worldwide database entitled “The Phoenix Raven Locations
   List,” in which each airfield is coded to indicate whether Ravens are “required,”
   “recommended,” or “not required.” There is a fourth category in which the deploying force
   may “consider” Ravens depending on the current threat situation. The AFRC TWG uses the
   Raven List to recommend whether to assign Ravens to a particular mission.
   8.5.2. If a flying unit requires Raven team support, it must provide a fund cite for travel and
   per diem and coordinate the security requirements through AFRC/A7SX. Phoenix Ravens
   will be designated as MEP and placed on AF Form 41, Flight Authorization, IAW AFI 11-
   401.
8.6. Recommendations and approval. After reviewing the recommendations of the AFRC
TWG members, AFRC FGC/FGO may approve the deployment with or without
countermeasures or cancel the deployment. If the mission is approved, recommendations of the
AFRC TWG are directive on AFRC personnel unless otherwise stated. The DRA, recommended
countermeasures and FGO approval will be published on the AFRC/FGC/FGO SIPRNet
SharePoint site. FGOE will enter the TWG approval date in the Aircraft Security section of the
SMS Setup Sheet and annotate whether restrictions or countermeasures have been published.

                                   MISSION FUNDING

9.1. Flying hour funding. Normally the command which owns the aircraft is responsible for
funding flying hour costs. When the aircraft are assigned to another command, AFRC
reimburses that command when AFRC aircrews perform training missions in those aircraft.
   9.1.1. UE aircraft assigned to AFRC. Hours flown in UE aircraft to train AFRC aircrews are
   funded using wing Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funds. Airlift hours flown in support
   of UCC operational requirements are funded using O&M; however the flying hour cost is
   reimbursed to HQ AFRC by the supported command IAW the mission symbol or Emergency
   and Special Program (ESP) code entered in the AFTO Form 781. UE air refueling hours are
   normally funded using wing O&M but may be reimbursable to HQ AFRC if flown in support
   of UCC operational requirements. Flying hours for the RAS program are funded from the
   supporting unit’s O&M allocation using mission symbol T37R.
   9.1.2. Associate aircraft assigned to AMC or ACC. Hours flown in associate C-5 and C-17
   aircraft to train AFRC aircrews are reimbursed to AMC at the Training, Test and Ferry (TTF)
   rate from a fund centrally managed by HQ AFRC. Hours flown in other MDS associate
   aircraft to train AFRC aircrews are also reimbursed from a centrally managed fund but at the
   owning MAJCOM Air Force Cost Analysis Improvement Group (AFCAIG) rate.
9.2. Pay and allowances/travel and per diem.
   9.2.1. AFRC missions. AFRC aircrews flying training missions in military status utilize
   wing Reserve Personnel Appropriation (RPA) funds for pay and allowances and travel and
   per diem. Air Reserve Technicians (ARTs) flying training missions in civilian status utilize
   wing O&M funds for pay and allowances and travel and per diem. Note: See AFRCI 36-
   803, Air Reserve Technician Time and Attendance Procedures and Audits, for applicable
   rules governing an ART's required and permissible status (military/civilian) when performing
   certain missions including certain flying missions.
   9.2.2. UCC missions. AFRC aircrews flying missions in support of AMC (AFTRANS) or
   ACC utilize Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) funds from a centrally managed
   account IAW Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) with those commands for pay and
   allowances. AFRC aircrews flying missions in support of other MAJCOM or UCC
   requirements utilize MPA funded by the supported command for pay and allowances. The
   tasking message from the MAJCOM or UCC authorizing use of MPA will identify the
   funding source for travel and per diem. Pay and allowances for JA/ATT missions are funded
   IAW the point system described in AMC OPORD 17-76.
      9.2.2.1. Air refueling missions. Pay and allowances and travel and per diem for Coronet
      missions and priority 1 and 2 air refueling missions utilize MPA funded by AMC. Pay
      and allowances and travel and per diem for priority 3 BEs utilize MPA if contracted
      before the AMC quarterly long-range scheduling process ("the horseblanket") closes
      (after which they will be tasked to active duty tanker units). Because they are offered
      only for the training opportunity, priority 4 and any untasked priority 3 air refueling
      missions utilize RPA for pay and allowances and travel and per diem for personnel in
      military status and O&M for travel and per diem for ARTs. Note: The Transportation

     Working Capital Fund (TWCF) is USTRANSCOM’s revolving transportation fund from
     which AFRC receives reimbursement for performing USTRANSCOM airlift missions.
     TWCF is normally used to fund SAAMs and channel missions but, because airlift is
     considered a secondary purpose, not dual-role missions. Missions and cargo funded by
     TWCF are referred to as “TWCF missions” and “TWCF cargo.”

                                           REPORTS

10.1. General. This chapter establishes and/or restates authority for reporting requirements by
mission type. Operations group commanders are responsible for ensuring compliance with the
reporting requirements below.
10.2. Movement reporting. During OST missions, the AC will report arrival and departure
times and any problems/delays to the appropriate C2 agency. Delays which will impact
subsequent mission legs will also be reported to the airlift POCs for those legs. ACs on AFRC
Close Watch missions will report projected schedule deviations of more than 30 minutes to the
AFRC command center when the delaying circumstances first become known.
10.3. Passenger/cargo movement. The AC will report the number of passengers and tons of
cargo transported on each leg of an AFRC training mission to the C2 agency at the end of each
duty day. After mission completion, the AC will scan and attach the DoD Form 2131, Passenger
Manifest, to the SMS setup sheet.
10.4. Aerial refueling reports. The AC will complete and submit the DD Form 791, DoD In-
Flight Issue Log, to the Wing Refueling Document Control Officer (WRDCO) within 24 hours
of refueling sortie termination IAW AFI 11-2KC-MDS, Vol 3, KC-MDS Operations Procedures.
10.5. Aerial refueling receiver reports. The AC will complete and submit the air refueling
receiver reports IAW AFI 11-221, Air Refueling Management (KC-10 and KC-135).
10.6. Remain Over Night (RON) procedures. ACs will provide aircrew billeting information
and telephone contact numbers to the appropriate C2 agency.
10.7. Non-Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft. The AC of a NMC aircraft will report the below
information to the parent wing CP and the C2 agency, if different:
   10.7.1. Tail number, aircraft type, location;
   10.7.2. AC’s name, phone number, crew rest location, room number;
   10.7.3. Mission-essential maintenance conditions, fault isolation number, if applicable, and
   trouble-shooting actions that have been accomplished;
   10.7.4. When discovered;
   10.7.5. Progress of maintenance actions to date;
   10.7.6. If parts are required, provide the following:
       10.7.6.1. Noun (part nomenclature);
       10.7.6.2. Quantity;
       10.7.6.3. Part Number;
       10.7.6.4. National Stock Number (NSN);
       10.7.6.5. Technical Order Reference--illustrated parts breakdown (-4);
       10.7.6.6. Work Unit Code (WUC) or ref des (GO81);

   10.7.7. Whether an MRT is required; and
   10.7.8. Whether the airlift POCs for subsequent mission legs have been notified.
10.8. JA/ATT missions. Daily aircraft activity reports will be filed with the wing CP. Airdrop
and aircraft incident reports and post-mission reports will be filed IAW AMC OPORD 17-76.
10.9. Exercises. A post-mission report will be filed following participation in a Joint Chiefs of
Staff (JCS), AF or AFRC exercise IAW AFRCI 10-204. Additional reporting may be required
by the exercise OPORD.
10.10. Event/incident reports. Operations Reports (OPREPs) are the responsibility of the C2
network IAW AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting; however, because the information chain often
begins with the aircrew, ACs will report the following types of OPREP-reportable incidents to
the nearest command post or to the AFRC command center:
   10.10.1. Aircraft emergencies,
   10.10.2. Flight safety incidents,
   10.10.3. Inflight diversions as a result of aircraft malfunctions,
   10.10.4. Airdrop malfunctions/incidents,

   Note: Incidents which result or could potentially result in damage to equipment or injury to
   personal will be investigated by the safety office IAW AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety
   Investigations and Reports. AC’s should make a record of OPREP-reportable information
   which is likely to result in a safety investigation rather than assume that the command
   post/command center will forward the information to the safety office.
10.11. Aerial demonstrations. Aerial demonstrations will be critiqued/reviewed and negative
feedback reported IAW AFI 11-246, Volume 6.
10.12. 302 AW wildland fire fighting. Reports will be filed IAW the USNORTHCOM
