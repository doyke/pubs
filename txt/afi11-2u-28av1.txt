     after the student demonstrates the required level of knowledge and proficiency.
     Complete and sign off all required training items prior to recommending the student for
     an evaluation or certifying the student in a maneuever or procedure.
     1.3.10.5. Each instructor aircrew member is responsible for the safe execution of the
     duties of their respective crew position. At any time during the flight, if the judgment or
     proficiency of the student should raise a question in the instructor’s mind as to the
     student’s ability to safely execute the duties of the aircrew position, the instructor will
     immediately take over these duties. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate
     the proper method of executing these duties. Instructors must be highly knowledgeable
     in PC-12/U-28A Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) and governing AFIs to
     provide immediate instruction to any crew position concerning weapon system
     employment and regulatory and nonregulatory guidance. All instructors will place
     special emphasis on the procedures for positive identification of emergency conditions
     before initiating corrective action. In addition, instructors will place a high emphasis on
     the procedures for positive exchange of control; these procedures will be thoroughly
     briefed.
     1.3.10.6. Instructors who demonstrate deficiencies in their ability to instruct may be
     relieved of instructor duties. Commanders will take the necessary action to either retrain
     or remove those individuals from instructor status IAW Air Force or AFSOC directives.

1.4. Aircrew Training Policy. The primary training method for PC-12/U-28 initial
qualification, requalification, or upgrade training is attendance at an ETCA formal school.
USAF policy dictates the use of formal schools unless attendance is impractical. The secondary
method is in-unit training using applicable formal school courseware. Secondary method
training (SMT) requires a waiver be submitted through appropriate channels per this instruction
and approved by HQ AFSOC/A3T. (Note: Formal schools will not forward written
examinations as part of the courseware for in-unit qualification training). AFRC/ANG units may
accomplish upgrade in-unit without a waiver. Any aircrew member who was previously
disenrolled from a formal ETCA course for substandard performance is ineligible for a
secondary method training waiver. The unit is the primary source for formal training products.
When specific formal courseware is not published, use of locally developed training syllabi is
authorized. Units will forward all locally developed syllabi for in-unit training to HQ
AFSOC/A3T for review and approval. All locally approved in-unit syllabi are posted on the HQ
AFSOC/A3T web page.
   1.4.1. Secondary Method Training (SMT). Aircrew members (primary or supervisory) must
   complete SMT within 180 days from the date of their first ground training session or first
   flight, whichever occurs first. Individuals will start training within 45 days of waiver
   approval. Individuals unable to complete training within these limits may continue training;
   however, their units will notify HQ AFSOC/A3T with a description of the difficulty and
   expected completion date (not to exceed an additional 120 days). If SMT is not completed
   by this date, any further extension requires HQ AFSOC/A3 approval. Commanders will
   ensure aircrew personnel engaged in qualification or requalification training complete their
   training in a timely and uninterrupted manner.
       1.4.1.1. Formal School courseware requests. For SMT, the waiver authority (per Table
       1.1) will include the appropriate formal school as an addressee on all correspondence and
       will request that the formal school forward applicable courseware to the aircrew
       member’s unit of assignment. Courseware includes but is not limited to; the course
       syllabus, briefings, Computer Based Training (CBT) modules, student and instructor
       guides, and training guides and grade sheets for the student’s training folder. The unit
       training office will verify the current version is used.
       1.4.1.2. Complete all academic, ground, and flight training outlined in the courseware.
       When the courseware is adapted for local use, modify it only if the training is
       incompatible with local training conditions (e.g., simulator not available).
       1.4.1.3. AFSOC approved differences training may be conducted in unit without a
       waiver (see Chapters 2 and 3).
       1.4.1.4. Units conducting training where a waiver is not required (i.e., complete training
       for restricted AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, AFSOC approved
       differences training) will send a request for any applicable courseware through channels
       to HQ AFSOC/A3T, with an information copy to the appropriate formal school. Include
       unit point of contact (name, rank, office symbol, and telephone number) and the name
       and rank of the individual who will receive the training.
   1.4.2. Training Forms. Aircrew training records and forms will be established and
   maintained per Chapter 6 of this instruction.
AFI11-2U-28AV1 14 MARCH 2013                                                                     13


     1.4.2.1. AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications, will be used to document
     ground/flying training associated with mission qualification, and to document instructor
     certified and one-time/initial flying training events. The AF Form 4348 is maintained in
     the individual’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) per AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew
     Standardization/Evaluation Program.
     1.4.2.2. The following forms aid management of aircrew training programs.
         1.4.2.2.1. AF Form 4109, SOF/CSAR Aircrew Training Record, is used as the
         training record jacket to document in-unit qualification or upgrade of an aircrew
         member. It documents applicable ground training, special function training, part task
         training, cockpit procedures training, simulator training, and flying training
         accomplished by crew members.
         1.4.2.2.2. AF Form 4110, Comments – SOF/CSAR Training Record, is used to
         document narrative comments on aircrew training activities.
         1.4.2.2.3. AF Form 4111, SOF/CSAR Training Record, is used to list required
         proficiency levels (RPL), indicate events for training sortie completion, and to
         document demonstrated student task and subtask performance and knowledge
         proficiency levels. Units are authorized to overprint and reproduce AF Form 4111 for
         approved course syllabi. The number of training tasks in the appropriate training
         guide is a recommended minimum, which normally allows the student to achieve
         proficiency. It is neither intended to restrict the number of times the task must be
         accomplished nor restrict proficiency advancement.
     1.4.2.3. For Weapons Instructor Course (WIC), prepare training records IAW United
     States Air Force Weapons School (USAFWS) guidance.
  1.4.3. Aircrew Training While Duties Not Involving Flying (DNIF). Crew members whose
  status is DNIF may log ground training events, including simulator training, if the member’s
  physical condition allows. Consult the AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation For Flying
  or Special Operational Duty, to determine if the DNIF status includes ground training
  limitations. Contact the local Flight Surgeon Office for any required clarifications.
  1.4.4. In-flight Supervision. Unless specifically directed, the unit commander determines
  the level of supervision necessary to accomplish required training. If the mission objectives
  include introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, then an
  instructor may be required. The following personnel must be supervised by an instructor
  from a like crew position when performing aircrew duties.
     1.4.4.1. Noncurrent crew members.
     1.4.4.2. Crew members in initial, difference, upgrade or requalification flying training.
     1.4.4.3. Senior officers who have not completed initial qualification as outlined in
     Chapter 2, and as outlined in paragraph 1.7., of this instruction.
  1.4.5. Cross Crew Position Training (CCPT). With unit commander, operations officer, or
  flight order authenticating official approval, instructors from one crew position may train
  crew members from a different crew position on specific skills/events in which both are
  qualified (as long as the instructor is current in that event) unless otherwise restricted in this
 14                                                      AFI11-2U-28AV1 14 MARCH 2013


   volume. Flight evaluations must comply with requirements of AFI 11-2U-28V2, U-28
   Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
1.5. Service Commitments. Formal training, either primary or secondary method, conducted
per this instruction may incur a service commitment IAW AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service
Commitments (ADSC). Reference the appropriate AFI for program specifics. Individuals will
acknowledge the incurred SC by signing the appropriate Service Commitment
Acknowledgement Statement, prior to entering training. The unit training officer will notify
AFPC/DPSFO via the servicing military personnel flight (MPF) once training is complete.
1.6. Waivers: HQ USAF/A3O is the waiver authority for training requirements specified in
AFI 11-202V1, which has been delegated to HQ AFSOC/A3 for specific aircrew training events
(case-by-case basis). These requirements currently include initial Crew Resource Management
(CRM) training, initial Aircrew Flight Equipment and procedures training, Survival Evasion
Resistance Escape (SERE), flight evaluations, and egress training (see AFI 11-202V1, for
specific guidance). For case-by-case individual waivers for flight physical and physiological
training currencies, HQ AFSOC/SGP and AFMSA/SG3PT are the respective waiver authorities.
Some ground training items (e.g., small arms training, Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC), etc.) are
tasked by other agencies. Reference the source instruction to determine the waiver authority in
these cases. HQ AFSOC/A3 is the waiver authority for MDS-specific Volume 1 aircrew training
requirements unless otherwise noted in this AFI.

  AFSOC/A3T. Formal schools will forward current copies of courseware materials to units
  semiannually. Maintain copies of all waivers in the individual’s training folder. If the
  training incurs an ADSC per paragraph 1.5., this instruction, include the statement
  “Individual acknowledged receipt of ADSC by signing the AF Form 63, Active Duty Service
  Commitment Acknowledgement Statement, on <date AF Form 63 signed>.
  1.6.4. Operations Group commander or equivalent (e.g., CJSOAC/CC) may:
     1.6.4.1. Waive 10 percent of the total and PAA hours required for upgrade in all crew
     positions, on an individual basis only. A copy of the waiver must be filed in the
     individual’s training record. Students attending formal school will bring a waiver letter
     to the formal school for insertion into their training record.
     1.6.4.2. Extend ground training requirement due dates up to 2 months for Note 1 items in
     RTM, Table 4.2 on an individual basis only (Exception: Items referenced in paragraph
     1.6., this instruction, levied by other AFIs may not be waived by the OG unless
     specifically authorized to do so in the source AFI). These events may count towards the
     next periodic requirements (units should note on waiver when events were accomplished
     and the ARMS due date should be updated).
     1.6.4.3. Extend due dates for the duration of an exercise, contingency or operational
     mission for RTM, Table 4.2 events on an individual basis only if a crew member goes
     overdue while away from home station and the training is not available at the deployed
     location (Exception: Items referenced in paragraph 1.6., this instruction, levied by other
     AFIs may not be waived by the OG unless specifically authorized to do so in the source
     AFI).

       1.6.4.4. Waive all flying training requirements (RTM, Tables 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 except as
       otherwise noted) on an individual basis only. Wings/groups must keep an accurate record
       of waivers granted. Notify HQ AFSOC/A3T when waivers are issued.
   1.6.5. Unit commanders may carry new crew members as “mission ready” (MR) for up to
   six months if an aircrew member arrives at the unit after a permanent change of station (PCS)
   or formal school and is not MR in all core mission events. Units must notify HQ
   AFSOC/A3T of any OG extensions. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform events in
   which they are not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. This policy
   does not apply to basic aircraft qualification events. If training is not complete in six months,
   the aircrew member becomes “non-mission ready” (NMR). Squadrons will have six months
   from the time a new core mission event is added and AFSOC guidance issued to train and
   qualify aircrew in the new event.
1.7. Senior Officer Flying/Supervisory Aircrew. See AFI 11-202V1 AFSOC Supplement;
and AFI 11-401 Aviation Management.
1.8. Intra-command and Inter-command Transfer of Aircrews. For intra-command transfer
of aircrew members, the gaining organization will honor validated training completed by newly
assigned crew members prior to the transfer. For inter-command transfer, certifications and
qualifications should be accepted to the maximum extent practical, as long as training and
evaluation standards are equivalent. The operations officer at the gaining unit should review the
individual's career training folder and flight evaluation folder to determine which certifications
and qualifications will be honored. Aircrew members qualified in the same MDS are considered
qualified in that equipment throughout the force when used for the same mission.
   1.8.1. Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Screening. Losing units will screen individual
   flight and ground training records during unit out-processing. Accomplish this screening in
   sufficient time to correct discrepancies prior to PCS. Losing unit will provide a printed copy
   of current ground and flying training summaries to individuals prior to PCS. See AFI 11-401
   for additional guidance.
   1.8.2. Instructor training and qualifications may be accepted at the discretion of the gaining
   unit commander.
1.9. Initial Cadre for Change of Equipment or Capability. Authorization to form initial
cadre crews will be contained in the conversion program action directive. Unless otherwise
stated in the program action directive, the following conditions will apply to management of
initial cadre aircrew qualification for aircraft conversion:
   1.9.1. A nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) will be formed to
   begin aircrew training. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than
   currently held; for example, HC-130P IP to HC-130J flight examiner.
   1.9.2. Units send proposed initial cadre list by name, rank, current crew position and aircraft,
   total flying time, and requested crew qualification level through channels to HQ AFSOC/A3
   for approval.
       1.9.2.1. Following final approval, publish a squadron letter to identify initial cadre
       instructors and flight examiners by aircraft and crew qualification and file in each cadre
       individual’s FEF at Tab 2.
AFI11-2U-28AV1 14 MARCH 2013                                                                     17


       1.9.2.2. If a checkride was accomplished, enter appropriate comments in the remarks
       section of AF Form 8 explaining the individual’s status as initial cadre instructor or flight
       examiner.
   1.9.3. Initial cadre is not required for minor aircraft modifications when any required
   training for that modification is provided by the contractor and/or can easily be accomplished
   in-unit. Conduct differences training for the new equipment and log training on a letter of Xs
   or Memo for Record (MFR). Crew members will not fly with new equipment until trained.
1.10. Unit Aircrew Capability (DOC). Squadrons will maintain mission ready status on all
primary aircrew members up to unit authorizations (N/A for USAFWS instructor aircrew
members). Commanders will train aircrews to meet capabilities specified in unit DOC
statements. Supervisory aircrew and staff members assigned above squadron level, which are in
excess of the unit’s mission requirements, will maintain mission ready, basic mission capable, or
basic aircraft qualification status, as required. Note: To change from BMC to MR status, a crew
member will begin maintaining full MR flying currency. The unit commander may assign
additional training, as desired.
   1.10.1. Commanders should not assign additional duties to first assignment “pipeline”
   (directly out of formal MDS training) crew members (officer and enlisted) for their first 6
   months in the unit. First assignment crew members in any AFSOC weapon system should
   not normally be given an additional duty for the first 6 months in the unit. This policy allows
   pipeline students to learn the weapon system without distraction of an additional duty;
   however, first assignment senior personnel may be assigned additional duties.
   1.10.2. Aircrew members will not perform long term duties that detract from the primary
   duties of training for, or performing the unit flying mission.
   1.10.3. Air Combat Command (ACC) Currency Requirements. Permanent Party aircrew
   assigned to the 14 WPS USAFWS as instructors must maintain at least basic mission capable
   flying currency in the portions of the mission they will instruct. Unit commanders may direct
   specific individuals to maintain only partial BMC qualifications. In such cases, the crew
   member will require only those currency items associated with this tailored qualification.
   The individual’s AF Form 8 will indicate applicable restrictions based on assignments of less
   than full mission qualification. If 14 WPS crew members augment operational units, the
   gaining unit commander must be provided a detailed list of the individual’s current training
   status. The individual must comply with MR training requirements of the gaining unit or
   pursue applicable waivers through the operational unit’s AFSOC/A3. The gaining unit or
   AFSOC may levy additional requirements as desired. Chapter 4 and the current U-28A
   Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memo (RTM) outline exceptions to continuation currency
   training requirements for these personnel. Note: For the purposes of this instruction,
   enlisted aircrew members assigned to the             14 WPS are not considered USAFWS
   instructors.
1.11. Changes. Recommendations for improvement to this instruction are encouraged. Send
recommendations to HQ AFSOC/A3T, through command channels, on an AF Form 847.
AF/A3/5 is the approval authority for interim changes to this instruction.
   1.11.1. HQ AFSOC/A3 will determine training requirements for subordinate units. AFI
   changes will be issued via revision, Interim Change (IC), or Administrative Change (AC) to
 18                                                      AFI11-2U-28AV1 14 MARCH 2013


   this publication. Due to dynamic requirements of Combatant Commanders, training
   requirements and currencies may be altered regularly. These training requirements and
   currency adjustments may be made via RTM. HQ AFSOC/A3 will be an info addressee on
   all changes.
1.12. Deviations. This instruction does not authorize deviations from the flight manual or any
other Air Force Instruction. Flight safety will be given prime consideration and must take
precedence over the requirements and guidance of this instruction.
1.13. Publication Administration. This instruction is distributed to AFSOC, AFRC, AFSOC-
gained units, and AFSOC related schools based on requirements established through the Air
Force Publications Distribution Office (AFPDO). All aircrew members are authorized this
instruction. Distribution to units, organizations, and individuals outside these commands or not
associated with the MDS may be made upon specific request and justification.
   1.13.1. Supplements. Forward all unit or AFSOC supplements to this instruction to HQ
   AFSOC/A3TA, who in turn will forward to USAF/A3O-AT for approval. Provide HQ
   AFSOC/A3TA, and applicable HQ AFSOC/A3T a copy of all approved supplements. If
   required by mission or location, units may supplement this instruction by coordinating with
   HQ AFSOC/A3T before publication.

                                            Chapter 2

                                QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. Overview. This chapter outlines the minimum requirements for Basic Aircraft
Qualification (BAQ) training which may be completed via initial qualification, requalification,
conversion, or differences training. Duties not directly related to qualification or requalification
training should be minimized.
   2.1.1. BAQ training is completed via the PC-12 initial qualification training (IQT) syllabus.
   Individuals transitioning from other aircraft or requalifying per requirements of section
   4.4.3., this instruction, must complete the full PC-12 IQT course.
   2.1.2. Qualification training provides the training necessary to initially qualify crew
   members in a basic crew position and flying duties without regard to the unit’s mission.
   Upon completion of qualification training, the crew member attains BAQ status. BAQ is a
   prerequisite for Mission Qualification Training (MQT).
   2.1.3. Combat System Operators do not have a basic qualification and will be required to
   complete items in Table 2.1. prior to beginning mission qualification training.
2.2. General Requirements. The primary method of initial qualification and requalification
training is the appropriate formal training course listed in the ETCA. If no requalification course
exists, conduct requalification using the initial qualification course. Completing the appropriate
formal course satisfies the training requirements of this chapter. When attendance is not
practical or quotas are not available, units may request secondary method in-unit qualification
training waivers IAW paragraph 1.4.1., this instruction. AFRC/ANG units may accomplish
upgrade in-unit without a waiver. Any aircrew member who has previously failed to
successfully complete the ETCA formal course for substandard performance will not be issued a
secondary method training waiver.
2.3. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate formal course
syllabus, the ETCA, AFI 11-202V1, and this instruction. The formal school Syllabus of
Instruction (SOI) designates the course prerequisite approval authority.
2.4. Ground Training Requirements. All crew members must complete ground training
requirements IAW Table 2.1, prior to the first flight. Events [G002] and [G045] are not required
for Flight Surgeon, Medical Technician, or Combat Camera Aerial Photographers. See Chapter
4 and the current U-28A Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memo (RTM) for event descriptions.

 S-V90-A)
 Notes: See AFI 11-202V1, AFSOC Supplement, for Flight Surgeon, Medical Technician, and
 Combat Camera Aerial Photographer Training requirements.
 * Not required for Combat Systems Officers
   2.4.1. Written Examination. Open and closed book qualification examinations must be
   completed before the completion of basic qualification flying training. Written examinations
   must satisfy the requirements of AFI 11-202V2 and MDS Volume 2. When qualification
   training is completed by secondary method, the student will complete the appropriate group
   stan/eval or equivalent examination IAW AFI 11-202V2, paragraph 5.2.7. IAW AFI 11-
   202V2, paragraph 5.2.7.1. and paragraph 5.2.7.2., all requisites must be completed within the
   6-month eligibility period prior to/encompassing the scheduled flight evaluation.
   2.4.2. Emergency Egress Training, Non-Ejection [LL03]. All crew members and other
   personnel regularly flying on AFSOC aircraft will receive hands-on egress training in the
   aircraft prior to their first flight. See current RTM for further details.
   2.4.3. Pilatus PC-12 Training Course (initial) [G045]. All pilots must complete the HQ
   AFSOC/A3T approved training course (or suitable alternative approved by HQ
   AFSOC/A3T) prior to their first flight. This course is designed to provide a baseline of
   knowledge on aircraft systems and performance, in addition to simulator events, before
   commencing formal USAF flight training.
2.5. Flying Training Requirements. Satisfactorily completing the appropriate ETCA formal
course satisfies the requirements of this section. Approved in-unit qualification training must be
accomplished IAW applicable formal school courseware and the guidance below:
   2.5.1. Flying training lessons should be completed sequentially. If mission scheduling or
   student progress dictates otherwise, in-unit training sequences may be changed by the unit
   Operations Officer.
2.6. Basic Aircraft Qualification Conversion/Differences Training. Conversion training is
normally associated with training between MDS (e.g., C-21 to C-130). Differences training is
conducted when training in a different series aircraft in the same mission design (e.g., C-130E to
C-130H3). Use differences training when changing between same design aircraft and the
amount of training needed for qualification does not warrant attendance at a formal qualification
course. Additionally, accomplish differences training when an aircraft is modified and any
required training for that modification can easily be accomplished in-unit. BAQ difference
training qualifies an aircrew member to be a basic crew member. The primary method for
differences training is via completion of a formal school transition course (TX). If a TX course
is not available, the alternate method is via in-unit ground and flight training IAW HQ
AFSOC/A3T approved AF Form 4111, satisfactory completion of the qualification written
open/closed examinations, and instructor certification on the AF Form 4348 for the new aircraft.
Aircrew members entered into differences training will complete training within 180 days after
the first flight of the training program.
AFI11-2U-28AV1 14 MARCH 2013                                                                  21


  2.6.1. Differences training is required when being certified in an aircraft that is a different
  series, but the same mission and design. For the purposes of basic qualification training, the
  Series 9, Series 10, and Series 11 PC-12 are considered the same MDS and differences
  training is not required.

                                            Chapter 3

                      MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT)

3.1. Overview. This chapter establishes the minimum training requirements for completing
mission qualification and requalification. Aircrew members completing mission qualification or
requalification will meet the requirements of this chapter. Upon completion of mission
qualification training, the crew member will be assigned either Basic Mission Capable (BMC) or
Mission Ready (MR) status.
3.2. General Requirements. The primary method of mission qualification or requalification is
to complete the appropriate formal training course listed in the ETCA. Completing the
appropriate formal course satisfies the training requirements of this chapter. If no requalification
course exists, conduct requalification using the initial mission qualification course. When
attendance is not practical or quotas are not available, units may request waivers to conduct
secondary method mission qualification training IAW paragraph 1.4.1, this instruction, using
formal school courseware. Any aircrew member who has previously failed to successfully
complete the ETCA formal course for substandard performance will not be issued a SMT
waiver. Units may supplement courseware to meet local requirements. Submit all courseware
change requests to HQ AFSOC/A3T prior to implementation.
3.3. Training Prerequisites. Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate formal course
syllabus, the ETCA, AFI 11-202V1, and this instruction. The formal school syllabus designates
the course prerequisite approval authority.
   3.3.1. This does not preclude simultaneous basic qualification and mission qualification
   training. Simultaneous/Concurrent Multiple-MDS qualification upgrades will not be
   accomplished.
   3.3.2. If there is not a separate mission requalification course, aircrew members requalifying
   in the unit’s mission will comply with the initial mission qualification course prerequisites.
3.4. Ground Training Requirements. Complete all ground training in RTM Table 3.1 as part
of mission qualification training or prior to certifying individuals as mission ready. Completion
of training will establish due dates for recurring ground training required in Chapter 4, this
instruction, and the current RTM. Credit any training accomplished at a formal school.
Qualified mission ready crew members transferred from other units require only unit specific
mission ready training events or events that are due/overdue.
   3.4.1. Academic Training. Complete all academic and ground training delineated in
   applicable courseware. If not included in the course syllabus, accomplish the minimum
   requirements listed in AFI 11-202V1 separately.
   3.4.2. Written Examination. Open and closed book mission written examinations must be
   completed before the completion of mission qualification flying training. For SMT, Group
   stan/eval or equivalent examinations satisfy the requirement for formal school End of Course
   examinations.
   3.4.3. See AFI 11-202V1, AFSOCSUP, for Flight Surgeon (FS), Medical Technician, and
   Combat Camera Aerial Photographer Training requirements.
AFI11-2U-28AV1 14 MARCH 2013                                                                   23


3.5. Flying Training Requirements. Satisfactorily completing the appropriate ETCA formal
course satisfies the requirements of this section. Approved in-unit qualification training must be
accomplished IAW applicable formal school courseware and the guidance below:
   3.5.1. Flying training lessons should be completed sequentially. If mission scheduling or
   student progress dictates otherwise, in-unit training sequences may be changed by the unit
   operations officer.
   3.5.2. There should be minimum time lapse between training missions, and every effort
   should be made to complete mission qualification training requirements within the prescribed
   time period.
   3.5.3. Crew member requirements may be completed on training or operational missions
   under the supervision of an instructor in the same aircrew position. Comply with restrictions
   in AFI 11-2U-28V3.
3.6. Specific Mission Training Requirements. None.

                                           Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. General Requirements.
   4.1.1. Requirements in this chapter satisfy the minimum flying and related ground training to
   maintain currency. Individual proficiency may require a greater number of events. The
   RTM contains all ground training and flying requirements tables and definitions.
   4.1.2. Training requirements may be completed on any sortie if the accrediting criteria of
   this instruction are met. Sorties and events that are compatible may be credited on the same
   flight.
   4.1.3. Aircrew members will not log continuation training requirements in events in which
   they are unqualified.
   4.1.4. Training events accomplished on an evaluation or an instructor certification (that
   event) may be credited toward the individual’s volume requirements.
   4.1.5. Flying training events accomplished during formal training will use the course
   completion date (successful evaluation or certification date) to establish the due dates for all
   subsequent currency and requirements. Use actual dates for ground training.
   4.1.6. Aircraft flying training requirements may be accomplished in an ATD as noted in
   RTM Tables 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 An RTM issued by HQ AFSOC/A3T may permit ATD event
   logging in excess of RTM Tables 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5
4.2. Training Levels (TL) The use of experience-based FTLs and Ground Training Levels
(GTLs) allows the squadron commander to prioritize training resources. Aircrew members
must meet the minimum criteria established in paragraph 4.2.1., this instruction, and Table 4.1
before assignment to the respective training level. FTL are not tied to flight hours for
AFRC/ANG. When these minima are met, awarding a training level is at the sole discretion of
the squadron commander. Note: The aircrew member’s availability to fly should not be a factor
in assigning a TL.
   4.2.1. FTLs are based on minimum primary aircraft assigned (PAA) time and total time per
   Table 4.1 For basic qualification FTL, PAA time will include any variant of PC-12, U-28A,
   or ATD for pilots and the U-28A or ATD for CSOs.
       4.2.1.1. FTL “A”-Highly experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members.
       4.2.1.2. FTL “B”-Experienced BAQ and/or MR aircrew members.
       4.2.1.3. FTL “C”-Inexperienced BAQ and MR aircrew members.

   4.2.2. Change of FTL. Once a semiannual period begins, personnel will not be moved to a
   level requiring fewer events until the next semiannual period.
   4.2.3. GTLs are based upon operational flying experience.
       4.2.3.1. GTL “1”–Aircrew members with 5 years or greater of operational flying.
       4.2.3.2. GTL “2”–Aircrew members with less than 5 years of operational flying.
4.3. Proration of Training Requirements. See AFI 11-202V1 and AFI 11-202V1,
AFSOCSUP.
4.4. Recurrency and Requalification Training. Training is required whenever an aircrew
member does not meet a currency requirement in this instruction. An aircrew member will not
perform events unsupervised until training has been accomplished.
   4.4.1. Loss of Currency. Failure to accomplish events listed in continuation training RTM
   Tables 4.2 through 4.5 results in a loss of currency for that event. Crew members are
   noncurrent the day after event currency expires, but may continue to fly with an instructor or
   flight examiner until recurrency is gained.
       4.4.1.1. Loss of currency in any RTM Table 4.3 event results in loss of basic aircraft
       currency, except as noted. These individuals will fly under the supervision of an
       instructor or flight examiner on all sorties until recurrent.
          4.4.1.1.1. RTM Table 4.3 currency requirements may be accomplished in either a
          PC-12, U-28A, or ATD. If basic training cycle currency is lost (failure to complete
          the requirements of RTM Table 4.3), it is lost for both aircraft. Lost basic training
          cycle currency may be regained in either aircraft or the ATD per RTM Table 4.3
          restrictions.
       4.4.1.2. Loss of currency exceeding 6-months. Crew members noncurrent in designated
       BAQ events (RTM Table 4.3, Note 1 events) in excess of six months results in loss of
       BAQ. Crew members noncurrent in designated mission events (RTM Table 4.4, Note 1
       events) in excess of six months results in loss of mission qualification.
   4.4.2. Regaining Currency.
       4.4.2.1. Only RTM Tables 4.3 and 4.4, Note 1 events require an evaluation (unqualified)
       if loss of currency exceeds 6 months (see AFI 11-202V1). Other events require showing
       proficiency to an instructor in the aircraft or ATD to regain currency. If loss of currency
       exceeds 24 months in non-note 1 events, additional training will consist of ground and
       flight training as directed by the unit commander (training folder must be opened).
       4.4.2.2. Aircrew noncurrent in special mission events that only require an instructor
       certification (RTM Table 4.5) may regain currency by showing proficiency in that event
       to an instructor. Cross aircrew position recurrencies must be approved by Sq/DO or
       flight order authenticating official.
       4.4.2.3. Aircrew noncurrent more than 24 months in special mission events (RTM Table
       4.5) requiring an evaluation will complete all initial training and evaluation requirements
       for that special mission.

   4.4.3. Requalification Training. Crew members requiring requalification will accomplish
   training IAW AFI 11-202V1, applicable MAJCOM supplements, and Chapters 2, 3, and 5,
   of this instruction.
4.5. Ground Training. Ground training will be accomplished IAW the RTM Table 4.2 (PC-
12/U-28A Ground Training Requirements). Crew members will comply with the time periods
listed for their FTL/GTL. Conduct training IAW the referenced publications, notes in RTM
Table 4.2, and the guidance below. The governing directive or RTM takes precedence over
Chapter 4 requirements. If the AFI 11-2U-28V1, is also listed as a governing directive, the
most restrictive guidance should be followed.
   4.5.1. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events.         Make-up training should be
   accomplished at the earliest opportunity. The following apply when crew members exceed
   due dates for the RTM Table 4.2 events.
      4.5.1.1. Grounding items.      Crew members will not perform flight duties until the
      grounding item is satisfied.
      4.5.1.2. Training status items. Crew members will not fly without instructor supervision.
      4.5.1.3. Mission Ready (MR) items. Failure to accomplish MR events in RTM Table
      4.2 results in non-mission ready status and the individual will not deploy as a crew
      member.
   4.5.2. Block Training. The parent Operations Group training office should establish and
   administer a centralized aircrew block training session. Block training should include all
   recurring ground training required to maintain readiness.
   4.5.3. Ancillary training. This volume is not a comprehensive list of all ancillary training
   required by the DoD. Ancillary training parent instructions take precedence over this AFI for
   those training items.
   4.5.4. Ground Training Events. See current U-28A Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memo
   (RTM) for Ground Training Event definitions and requirements.
4.6. Flying Training.
   4.6.1. All aircrew members who maintain BAQ, MR, or BMC must accomplish all
   applicable training requirements of RTM Table 4.3 (BAQ), based on assigned FTL (A, B, or
   C). MR and BMC aircrew will also comply with the following:
      4.6.1.1. MR aircrew members will also accomplish applicable mission ready
      requirements from RTM Tables 4.4 and 4.5 as designated in the RTM according to their
      mission qualification and FTL.
      4.6.1.2. BMC aircrew members will also accomplish at least 50 percent of the applicable
      mission requirements from RTM Tables 4.4 and 4.5 as designated in the RTM according
      to their assigned FTL.
      4.6.1.3. Instructors and flight examiners may not log events performed by other crew
      members during instruction or evaluations.
   4.6.2. Flying Training Events. See current U-28A Ready Aircrew Program Tasking Memo

 Notes:
 1. Previously qualified instructor pilots require only 200 PAA hours.
 2. Previously qualified instructors (Combat Systems Officer, Navigator, Electronic Warfare
 Officer, Fire Control Officer, or Weapons Systems Officer) only require 250 PAA hours.
5.2. Air Commando Pilot Development (ACPD). The Air Commando Pilot Development
program is a continuous upgrade process broken into six phases and replaces a traditional copilot
and aircraft commander upgrade scheme. ACPD is not a formal student syllabus, rather the
program provides a systematic way for pilots to chart a course for success in the U-28 and to
develop experience, knowledge, and judgement for command of the unique and complex U-28
mission. Furthermore, the program addresses the use of PC-12 aircraft as a basic flying platform
to facilitate upgrade and continuation training. This training should take, but is not limited to,
approximately two years to reach MP. Training timelines are based on performance and are at
the discretion of the Sq/CC. Additonally, they should be tailored to match an individual’s
capabilities, experience level, and maturity.
   5.2.1. Air Commando Pilot Development (ACPD) Overview.
       5.2.1.1. Typical pilot upgrade progression should be guided by the following programs,
       in this order; PC-12 Initial Qualification formal training course, Tactical and NVG
       Certification, U-28 Mission Pilot Qualification formal training course, Continuation
       Training, Basic Aircraft Commander (BAC) certification, Mission Aircraft Commander
       (MAC) formal training course. ACPD pilots must ensure they receive balanced exposure
       to the left and right seats to ensure proficiency and currency with flying and nonflying
       duties in both seat positions. Pilots will work with their leadership to ensure they receive
       sufficient training to gain experience prior to Basic Aircraft Commander certification and
       Mission Aircraft Commander qualification.
       5.2.1.2. PC-12 Initial Qualification formal training course, Tactical and NVG
       Certification, and U-28 Mission Pilot Qualification formal training course will normally
       be accomplished prior to the pilot arriving at the operational unit.
       5.2.1.3. ACPD Continuation Training.                This training involves classroom
       training/courses, simulator training, and flying training conducted during local and
       mission sorties. It is essential that the individual pilot take ownership of this training in
       order to progress throughout the U-28 upgrade process. Training includes, but is not
       limited to: Air Commando Baseline Course, Tactical Air Coordinator Qualification
       Course, Simulator Refresher Courses, Special Operations Planning Exercises, multilateral
       training exercises, aircrew proficiency sorties, mission proficiency sorties, and real world
       mission experience.
       5.2.1.4. Basic Aircraft Commander (BAC) Certification and Mission Aircraft
       Commander (MAC) formal courses are outlined in paragraph 5.3., this instruction.
       5.2.1.5. Aircrew Designation Codes. AFI 11-401 defines pilot aviation codes. For
       standardization, use the codes from Table 5.2 (3rd letter designator distinguishes the
       status for an ACPD pilot who completes the first phase of formal training with
       evaluation.)
AFI11-2U-28AV1 14 MARCH 2013                                                                  29

                                   who is performing instruction on basic/instructor certified
                                   flying events AND/OR mission events
 If “EP”                           Fully Certified/Qualified Evaluator Pilot who is performing
                                   evaluator duties
       5.2.1.6. All ACPD pilots will maintain qualification requirements according to AFI 11-
       2U-28V2. ACPD pilots will be dual-seat qualified for all Basic and Instructor Certified
       flying events. ACPD pilots may occupy either seat during formal/continuation training in
       the PC-12/U-28A, unless specified by SOI.
5.3. Aircraft Commander Certification. Commanders will consider experience, knowledge,
and judgment when identifying candidates.
   5.3.1. Basic Aircraft Commander Certification. Prerequisite flying time for basic aircraft
   commander certifications are based on pilots gaining the knowledge and judgment required
   to effectively accomplish the basic qualification training while in command of the PC-12/U-
   28A and is only one factor when considering upgrade candidates. Unit commanders will
   ensure continuation training programs emphasize these areas for their pilots.
       5.3.1.1. At the discretion of the squadron commander, pilots who were previously
       qualified as aircraft commanders or 4 ship flight lead in another major weapon system
       (MWS) may be entered into upgrade training without meeting the PC-12/U-28A hours in
       Table 5.1
       5.3.1.2. Once qualified, a basic aircraft commander may command a PC-12 or U-28A
       crew performing events in RTM Table 4.3 All flying crew members must be current and
       qualified in any event performed.
   5.3.2. Basic Aircraft Commander Certification Prerequisites. The prerequisite flying time
   levels in Table 5.1 are based on pilots having gained the knowledge and judgment required

annotated on AF Form 4348.
5.6. Special Mission Qualifications and Certifications. The commander will select aircrew
members qualified in the unit’s mission to maintain additional special qualifications and
certifications. A flight evaluation is required for Special Mission Qualifications, while
Certifications are gained IAW paragraph 5.7., this instruction. Special mission events are not
considered core mission events and are not required for mission ready status. Instructors are
authorized to teach any special qualifications in which they are qualified and current unless
specifically restricted.
5.7. Instructor Certified Events. Events that require instructor certification on the AF Form
4348 and the crew positions that require certification are listed below. These events may be
taught at the formal school as part of mission qualification training. Formal school instructors
will make AF Form 4348 entries for all training completed during mission qualification.

Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI)—Aircraft assigned to a unit to assist in maintaining
readiness. Aircraft designated as BAI assets do not receive funding or manning consideration.
AFI11-2U-28AV1 14 MARCH 2013                                                                  43


Basic Aircraft Qualification Aircrew Member—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed qualification training in the basic aircrew position and maintains aircraft currency
IAW this instruction.
Basic Mission Capable Aircrew Member—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily
completed mission qualification and is maintaining 50 percent of the applicable mission
qualification currency requirements of this instruction. Basic mission capable crew members
may perform primary crew duties on any unilateral training mission. For other missions, the unit
commander must determine the readiness of each basic mission capable crew member to perform
primary crew duties.
Calendar Month—Requirements are due once per month and not necessarily associated with a
30/60 day requirement. For example, an aircrew member could accomplish the event on 1
February and then on 31 March the following month and still fulfill the requirement.
Conversion Training—Training is normally associated with a unit conversion to another MDS.
Conversion training requires completion of a formal school initial qualification course. For unit
conversions, when formal school courses are not available to handle the throughput, MAJCOMs
will develop, and coordinate with the training command, in-unit training plans that maximize use
of highly experienced personnel as the initial cadre.
Core Mission Events—A crew member must be qualified in all core mission events to be
considered Mission Ready (MR) or Mission Capable (MC). To determine how non-currency in
any core mission event affects overall mission currency, refer to the aircraft’s Mission Ready
Flying Requirements Table (RTM Table 4.4). Loss of qualification in any core mission event
results in loss of overall mission qualification. A core mission event will be considered an
instructor certified event when it is not required to be evaluated on the Initial Mission
Evaluation. Squadrons will maintain at least 100 percent of their required manning as MR.
AFSOC unit CC/DO will determine the status/qualification of crew members in excess of 100
percent manning requirement.
Difference Training—Training accomplished when changing between same design aircraft and
the amount of training needed for qualification does not warrant attendance at a formal
qualification course.
Dual Qualified—A crew member who is qualified in more than one position in the same MDS.
Event—A training item to be accomplished. Multiple events may be completed and logged
during a sortie unless specifically excluded elsewhere in this instruction.
Formal School Courseware—Training materials and programs developed for training aircrew
members at formal schools. It includes all student study guides, workbooks, computer-based
training lessons, instructor guides, and AF Form 4111, Individual Mission Grade Record, related
to the specific course.
Formation Operations—Accomplish IAW applicable volume(s) of AFSOCI 11-202, AFI 11-
2U-28V3, T.O. 1-1C-1-20, and T.O. 1-1C-1-29. AFSOC guidance will never be less restrictive
than the formation definitions found in AFI 11-202V3, “Formation Flight”, “Nonstandard
Formation”, and “Standard Formation”. Formation operations place all aircraft in a critical
phase of flight which requires constant vigilance, strict discipline, and polished crew
 44                                                       AFI11-2U-28AV1 14 MARCH 2013


coordination for mission accomplishment. Training will ensure aircrew can think and plan for
multiple aircraft instead of single ship operations.
Instructor Certified Events—Training given to an aircrew member that requires an instructor
to certify the student's attainment of the required proficiency and knowledge levels as specified
in courseware and, if appropriate, AF Form 4111. Instructor certified events are documented in
AF Form 4348.
Mission Design and Series (MDS) for Aircraft—The official designation for aerospace
vehicles used to represent a specific category of aerospace vehicles for operations, support, and
documentation purposes.
Mission Essential Task List (METL)—Combat-oriented training requirements. All AFSOC
aircrew training requirements should be in support of unit METLs.
Mission Events—The squadron Doctrinal (DOC) Statement defines required crew capabilities.
These capabilities/tactics/events can be categorized as either Core or Special Mission.
Mission Oriented Simulator Training—Training conducted in a WST or MRD that
incorporates a full mission profile. The focus of this training should be crew coordination and
problem solving.
Mission Ready Aircrew Member—An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed
mission qualification and is maintaining all of the applicable mission qualification currency
requirements of this instruction.
Multiple Qualification—A crew member who is qualified in more than one MDS.
Primary Mission Aircraft Inventory (PMAI)—Aircraft assigned to a unit for performance of
its wartime mission. PMAI forms the basis for the allocation of operating resources to include
manpower, support equipment, and funding of flying hours.
Special Mission Events—Some MR/MC crew members will carry additional qualifications in
special mission events. Unit CC/DO will determine which crew members will be qualified in
special mission events. Unit CC/DO will determine if special mission events have affected C-
rating and report variations through Status Of Resources and Training Systems (SORTS).
Special mission requirements are also shown in RTM Table 4.4
Total Flying Time—Total time for all aircraft flown in military service to include student time.
Time accumulated must be in the aircrew member's current rating (i.e., pilot, navigator, etc.).
Training Cycle—A training period of time (i.e., quarterly, semiannually, annually).
Training Status—A deficient status in which a crew member must fly under the supervision of
an instructor when occupying a primary crew position. Once deficient items are corrected, the
crew member is removed from training status.
Volume—For the purposes of this instruction, volume refers to the number of events an aircrew
member must accomplish in a given period of time (i.e., quarterly or semiannually).
