              PII Breach Reporting, Notification and AFNET Account Actions

A1.1. General. The purpose of the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) PII breach reporting
and notification process is to ensure the security of the AFNET and ensure personnel using the
AFNET are protecting the personal information of our Airmen. The Commander, Air Force
Space Command (AFSPC/CC) has the authority and responsibility to operate, secure and defend
the Air Force Network (AFNET) IAW AFPD10-17, Cyberspace Operations.

A1.1.1. The policy outlined in this GM applies to all Air Force personnel (military and civilian),
contractors, DoD, government, and other users who have been authorized access to the AFNET.
It also applies to the 24th Air Force (24 AF) organizations that are tasked to support the breach
monitoring and notification process.

A1.1.2. Objectives of the PII Breach Reporting and Notification Process.

A1.1.2.1. Ensure users of the AFNET are compliant with appropriate operational, training, and
administrative AFIs and DoD requirements for the proper safeguarding and transfer of PII
information to/from the AFNET.

A1.1.2.2. Enhance senior commander awareness of PII breaches occurring in their organization
as they are detected by 24AF and reported to their Privacy Managers.

A1.1.2.3. Supplement, but not replace, the PII breach reporting requirements in AFI33-332, The
Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program.

A1.1.2.4. Provide a standardized process to assess, document and report PII breaches discovered
by 24 AF.

A1.1.2.5. Provide a standard response to potential breaches by locking out the accounts
associated with suspected breaches until the first O-6 or above in the individual’s chain of
command certifies that they should regain AFNET access. This process is accomplished IAW
AFI33-115, Vol 2 Licensing Network Users and Certifying Network Professionals and
AFMAN33-152, User Responsibilities and Guidance for Information Systems.

A1.1.3. Changes and Clarification.

Requirements (CCIR) reporting process covered in AFI 10-206 Operational Reporting, AFSPC

A1.2.2. Command Center Notification to HQ AFSPC Staff. Upon notification of a PII breach
from 624 OC via the CCIR process, the Command Center will notify AFSPC leadership within
the hour IAW their existing CCIR processes.

A1.2.3. 24 AF/CC Email Drafting Process. 624 OC will provide a draft email to the 24 AF staff
IAW attachment 2 and populate the affected Wing Commander’s email information. This will
be completed within an hour of receipt and forwarded to the 24 AF/CC workflow email for
review and transmittal.

A1.2.4. 24 AF/CC Notification to Wing Commanders. Upon notification of a PII breach from
the 624 OC, the 24 AF/CC or his designated representative will notify the affected wing
commander using the formatted email in Attachment 2. AFSPC/A3I, A6X, 24 AF, and/or 624
OC will assist with appropriate details to enable completion of the email.

AFNET account access for the identified individual. The account will remain locked until the
624 OC receives a request for resumption of access from the first O-6 in the individual’s chain of
command. This request must include proof that the individual has accomplished information
protection training which is available at https://golearn.csd.disa.mil/. Upon receipt of a
validated request, the 624 OC will initiate actions to unlock the individual’s account.

A1.4. Responsibilities.

A1.4.1. HQ AFSPC Command Center. The Command Center will report PII breaches upon
notification from 624 OC IAW PII CCIR guidelines.
A1.4.2. Each MAJCOM and installation Privacy Manager is responsible to report and
investigate breaches reported to them by 24 AF units for their personnel and installations.

A1.4.3. AFSPC/PA. AFSPC/PA will, in coordination with AFSPC/A3, implement a strategic
communication plan designed to inform all AFNET users and AF MAJCOM leadership of
AFSPC’s PII breach process and the consequences of incorrectly storing and transmitting PII
over the AFNET.

A1.4.4. 24 AF.

A1.4.4.1. 24 AF/CC will notify affected Wing Commanders (or equivalents) of accounts they
are locking IAW with this GM.

units IAW the AFSPC/CC CCIR list. 624 OC will direct account lock and unlock procedures to
