____________________________________________________________________________________________________

This pamphlet provides guidance for managing hazardous waste at Air Force installations to meet Federal, state, interstate,
Department of Defense (DoD), Air Force, and local environmental, worker safety, and transportation requirements. It helps
major commands (MAJCOM) implement AFI 32-7042, Solid and Hazardous Waste Compliance. MAJCOMs may adopt
all or portions of this guidance in order to meet the requirements of this AFI. Additionally, this guide assists in developing
basic training requirements for hazardous waste management for personnel at Air Force installations and their tenants,
including Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units and members. This pamphlet applies to the Air National Guard
except as modified by supplemental instructions developed to meet the unique requirements of the Guard. This pamphlet is
not intended for direct use by installations in foreign countries, but sections could be adopted to provide guidance for Air
Force activities at those locations.

           HAZARDOUS WASTE STREAM INVENTORY INSTRUCTIONS
 General Information. Each organization on-base that generates hazardous waste should be identified by its organization code
 and shop code. Tenant organizations, contractors, and others should be identified as specifically as possible. The inventory
 should also identify the name and telephone number of at least one point of contact at each generating activity.

 1.   Identify for each generating activity the building number, shop code, or other specific location, as appropriate, where
      hazardous waste is generated. If a generating activity generates waste at several locations, each should be identified. Grid
      locations from the hazardous waste management plan location map may be used to identify specific locations for
      accumulation sites, initial accumulation point, and TSDF on-base.

 2.   Each waste stream must be assigned a unique identification number (e.g., AB-001), which consists of a hazardous waste
      process code and a locally assigned number. The locally assigned number may be assigned sequentially for each waste
      stream generated from a specific process or operation. The hazardous waste process code is assigned from the codes listed in
      Table 3.6.

 3.   Identify the typical and maximum quantity of waste disposed annually.              If the waste is infrequently generated,
      indicateapproximate frequency.

 4.   Identify all hazardous waste criteria that the waste exhibits, sampling test results, and the test method used. Use the
      following codes: I-Ignitability; C-Corrosivity; R-Reactivity; T-Toxicity; F for F-List Waste; P for P-List Waste; K for K-List
      Waste; and U for U-List Waste.

 5.   Include the EPA hazardous waste number(s) for each waste stream, as well as any applicable state hazardous waste
      number(s). Wastes that exhibit one of the four hazardous waste characteristics have the following hazardous waste numbers:
      Ignitability- D001; Corrosivity - D002; Reactivity - D003; and Toxicity D004 through D043. The hazardous waste numbers
      for other constituents (F-, K-, P-, and U-list wastes) can be found at 40 CFR Part 261.

 6.   If any of the EPA priority pollutants listed in Table 3.7 are present in the waste stream, the appropriate priority pollutant
      identification number should be entered.

 7.   Indicate type of storage container such as drum, tank (above ground or below ground), or other (e.g., waste pile,
      impoundment). Also indicate any special accumulation conditions such as lab pack, pressurized, heated, cooled, etc.

 8.   Identify the disposition of the waste such as DRMO, recycled on base, base-contracted disposal, or some other form of
      recycling or disposal. Disposal Method Codes: CD-Contractor Disposal; DRMO-Disposal by Defense Reutilization and
      Marketing Office; SS-Sanitary Sewer; REC-Recycled; ENGY-Burned for Energy Recovery; UIP-Used in Process; and O-
      Other.

                                            Proper Shipping Name
     1.   Use the hazardous materials description and proper shipping name entry that appears in column 2 of
          the Hazardous Materials Table in Roman (bold) type. Italicized entries are not proper shipping
          names.

                                                                                           [49 CFR § 172.101(c)]
     2.   Use the hazardous materials description and proper shipping name in the Hazardous Materials Table,
          column 2 (49 CFR § 172.101), that most appropriately describes the hazardous waste. Select the name
          in the following order:

                First: Technical name

                       "1,1,1-Trichloroethane, 6.1, UN 2831, PG III"

                Second: Generic (family) name

                       "Alcohol, n.o.s., 3, UN 1987, III" "n.o.s." = "not otherwise specified."

                Third: Application, use, or common name (e.g., paint or paint related material)

                       "Paint, 3, UN 1263, PG II"

                Fourth: Generic hazard class

                       "RQ, Hazardous waste liquid, n.o.s. (Kepone), 9, NA 3082, III"


     3. For hazardous wastes, add the word "waste" if not included in the proper shipping name.

                "Waste paint, 3, UN 1263, PG II"

                                                                                        [49 CFR § 172.101(c)(9)]
                                           Table continued on next page.
AFPAM 32-7043 1 November 1995                                                                                        57



      Table 5.1. Continued.
      4.   If the waste is not described on the DoT Hazardous Material Table by name or by its former use, the
           waste may be a mixture or solution of a hazardous material and one or more non-hazardous materials.
           Look up each waste component in the Hazardous Materials Table. If one or more of the components is
           not listed on the table in column 2, the waste is a mixture or solution of a hazardous material and one
           or more non-hazardous materials. For combinations of hazardous waste with non-hazardous items
           (such as water), select the name from the Hazardous Materials Table for the hazardous component of
           the waste and add the words "mixture" or "solution" after the proper shipping name as appropriate.

                 A mixture is any combination of two or more chemical compounds or elements (solid or liquid).

                 A solution is a homogenous liquid mixture of two or more chemical compounds or elements that
                 will not undergo any segregation under conditions normal to transportation (e.g., Hydrochloric
                 acid mixed with water).

                 "Waste Hydrochloric acid, solution, 8, UN 1789, II"

                                                                                       [49 CFR § 172.101(c)(10)]
      5.   Determine if the material meets the description of more than one hazard class by referring to column 3
           of the Hazardous Materials Table. For example, a mixture may be both a flammable liquid and toxic,
           or a flammable liquid and corrosive. If so, use the hazardous precedence list presented in 49 CFR §
           173.2a to select a generic name for the material.

                 "Alcohols, toxic, n.o.s., 3, UN 1986, I"

                 "RQ, Waste Flammable Liquids, Corrosive, n.o.s., 3, UN 2924, II (D001, D002)"

                                                                                   [49 CFR § 172.101(c)(12)(iii)]
      6.   If the waste is a mixture of more than one hazardous material, determine if more than one DoT hazard
           class is specified. If not, use the name for the hazard class (see table at 49 CFR § 173.2) of the
           mixture as the proper shipping name preceded by the word "Waste" and followed by the letters "n.o.s."

                 "Waste flammable liquids, n.o.s. (Contains acetone and xylene), 3 UN 1993, II" for a mixture
                 of acetone and xylene would have a shipping name

                                                                                   [49 CFR § 172.101(c)(12)(iii)]
      7.   When two or more hazardous materials are mixed in the waste, the proper shipping name is based on
           the hazard class(es) of the mixed items. If the mixture has more than one hazard class, use the hazard
           precedence prescribed in § 173.2a to select the appropriate hazard class or division, thus the proper
           shipping name.

                 "Flammable liquid, corrosive, n.o.s., 3, UN 2924, II (Contains Methanol, Potassium
           hydroxide)"

                                                                                   [49 CFR § 172.101(c)(12)(iii)]

     Table 5.1. Continued.
     8.    If a generic name or n.o.s. shipping name is used, the technical name of the hazardous waste must be
           entered in (parentheses) in conjunction with the basic description.

                 "Waste flammable liquid, n.o.s., 3, UN 1993, II (Contains Hexanes)"

     9.    If a hazardous material is a mixture or solution of two or more hazardous materials, the technical
           names of at least two components most predominantly contributing to the hazards of the mixture or
           solution must be entered in parentheses with the shipping description.

                                                                                           [49 CFR § 172.203(k)(2)]
     10.   If the technical name of the compound or principle constituent which meets the criteria of Division
           6.1, Packing Group I or II is not part of the proper shipping name, then the technical name must be
           entered in parentheses.

                                                                                          [49 CFR § 172.203(m)(2)]

                                              Hazard Class/Division
     11.   Note the numerical hazard class/division associated with the proper shipping name in column 3 of the
           Hazardous Materials Table. Ensure the waste meets the criteria of the DoT hazard class/division (see
           definitions at 49 CFR § 173.50 through § 173.144). If the hazard class/division is the same, enter the
           numerical hazard class/division after the proper shipping name.

                                                                                              [49 CFR § 172.101(d)]
     12.   If the hazard class or packing group is not the same, check column 1 of the Hazardous Materials Table
           to see if there is a plus (+) for one or more of the components of the waste. If a plus (+) is present, the
           hazard class cannot be modified. If a plus (+) is not present, you may change the hazard class from
           one listed in the Hazardous Materials Table to the hazard class which more accurately defines the
           waste.

                                                                                       [49 CFR § 172.101(c)(12)(i)]

                                   UN or NA Identification Number
     13.   Enter the UN (United Nations) or NA (North American) identification number from column 4 of the
           table after the hazard class, preceded by either UN or NA.

                                                                                              [49 CFR § 172.101(e)]

    14.     Enter the packing group, in Roman numerals, from column 5 of the Hazardous Materials Table. The
            packing group may be preceded by the letters PG. If more than one packing group is listed, use the
            criteria or assigning packing groups found in Subpart D of 49 CFR Part 173.

    15.     If the quantity in one package equals or exceeds the reportable quantity (RQ) listed in Appendix A to the
            Hazardous Materials Table (or when in a mixture or solution, in a concentration by weight which equals
            or exceeds the concentration corresponding to the RQ of the material), it is considered a hazardous
            substance and must be appropriately identified in the shipping description. Hazardous substances are
            regulated by EPA and must be reported when discharged. The following information must be entered, in
            parentheses, in association with the basic description:

                  The name of the hazardous substance as shown in Appendix A to the Hazardous Materials Table;

     Note 1: Items A through K (shaded area) are not required by the Federal regulations. However, many states may require the waste
     generator or the TSDF to complete some or all of this information. The instructions listed above are typical of the state requirements but
     state environmental authorities should be contacted to specific requirements have been identified.

     Note 2: Emergency Communication Requirements. Emergency response telephone numbers must be entered on a manifest either
     immediately following descriptions in item 11, in item 4, or in another clearly visible location if the number is for all wastes listed on the
     manifest and the manifest indicates that the number is for emergency response information. For example, the notation "EMERGENCY
     CONTACT: (555) 555-1234", is an appropriate way to identify the emergency response telephone number on a manifest.

     DoT regulations also require additional emergency response information to be included on the manifest or attached to the manifest. The
     manifest must include, as a minimum, the following information: hazardous materials description; immediate hazards to health; risks of
     fire or explosion; immediate precautions to be taken in the event of an accident or incident; immediate methods for handling small or large
     fires; initial methods for handling spills or leaks in the absence of fire; preliminary first aid measures; and 24-hour manned emergency
     response telephone number. Transporters must keep the information easily accessible during transportation. A reference for each waste
     stream to the appropriate guide page in the DoT Emergency Response Guidebook in Section 15 of the manifest will satisfy this requirement
     if the transporter maintains a copy of the Guidebook in the vehicle at all times.

     The following burden disclosure statement must be included with each uniform hazardous waste manifest, either on the form, in the
     instructions to the form, or accompanying the form:

              "Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 37 minutes for generators, 15 minutes for
              transporters, and 10 minutes for treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. This includes time for reviewing instructions, gathering
              data, and completing and reviewing the form. Send comments regarding the burden estimate, including suggestions for reducing
              the burden to: Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW,
              Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and the Budget,
              Washington, DC 20503."

Terms

Contingency Plan--A document setting out an organized, planned, or coordinated course of action to be followed in case of
fire, explosion, or release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents which threaten human health or the
environment.
AFPAM 32-7043 Attachment 1 1 November 1995                                                                                101

Emergency Coordinator--Person responsible for handling hazardous waste releases and emergencies under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act.

Environment--Includes water, air, or land and the interrelationship which exists among and between water, air, and land
and all living things.

Environmentally Preferable--Products or services that have a lesser or reduced effect on human health and the
environment when compared with competing products or services that serve the same purpose. This comparison may
consider raw materials acquisition, production, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, reuse, operation, maintenance, or
disposal of the product or service.

Extremely Hazardous Substance--Any substance listed in appendix A or appendix B of 40 CFR 355. Appendix A is an
alphabetical listing of extremely hazardous substances. Appendix B lists extremely hazardous substances in order of each
substance's Chemical Abstracts Service registry number.

Facility--For emergency planning purposes, the term "facility" in 40 CFR 355, as it applies to the Air Force, is considered
equivalent to an "installation."

Hazardous Substance--Any substance listed in 40 CFR 302, table 302.4.

HAZMAT--All hazardous substances, petroleum, natural gas, synthetic gas, acutely toxic chemicals, and other toxic
chemicals including hazardous waste.

HAZMAT Response Team--Administrative term used to identify the total number of installation personnel assigned and
trained to the appropriate level. The purpose of this team is to respond to HAZMAT incidents to prevent or reduce human
injury or death, property damage, product loss and environmental damage.

HAZMAT Planning Team--Consists of representatives from disaster preparedness, fire protection, environmental
management, bioenvironmental engineering, security police, staff judge advocate, safety, and the HAZMAT response team.
Other representatives should augment this team, when appropriate. The HAZMAT planning team establishes and oversees
the installation HAZMAT program.

Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH)--The maximum level to which a healthy worker can be exposed for
30 minutes and escape without suffering irreversible health effects or escape impairing symptoms. These are exposure
concentrations established by NIOSH/OSHA as a guideline for selecting respiratory protection. As a rule, IDLH
concentrations should be an indication that appropriate respiratory protection is essential.

Incident Commander (IC)--Normally the senior fire official on-scene responsible for all decisions relating to the
management of the immediate incident scene. The IC reports to the OSC.

Incident Command System (ICS)--Nationwide system used to manage emergency incidents. Further information on the
ICS can be found in National Fire Academy's The Incident Command System, (NFA-ICS-SM), The National Emergency
Training Center, 1989; and Emergency Management Institute's Overview of the Incident Command System, (SM305.7),
The National Emergency Training Center, 1992.

Lethal Dose (LD)--The single dose of a substance that in laboratory tests is expected to kill a certain amount or percentage
of the test animals. It is based on ingestion (oral), absorption (skin) or injection. It can be expressed as milligrams of
material per kilogram of animal weight (mg/kg), or grams of material per kilogram of animal weight (g/kg). Two values
are normally seen: median lethal dose 50 (LD50); and lethal dose low (LDLo).

Lethal Concentrations (LC)--The concentration of a material in air that on the basis of laboratory tests is expected to kill a
certain amount or percentage of the test animals in a given period of time. It is based on inhalation, with the period of
exposure time from one to four hours. It can be expressed as parts of materials per million parts of air, by volume (ppm),
milligrams of material per cubic meter of air (mg/m3), or micrograms (one millionth of a gram) of material per liter of air
(ug/L). Two values are normally seen: median lethal concentration 50 (LC50); and lethal concentration low (LCLo).
102                                                                     AFPAM 32-7043 Attachment 1 1 November 1995

Local Emergency Planning Committee--A committee established by the state commission for each emergency planning
district to plan and coordinate local emergency response actions.

Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL)--The limit for the airborne concentration of a specified substance for a specified
time. Refer to AFOSH Standard 161-8, Controlling Exposures to Hazardous Materials, for further information.

Oil--Oil of any kind or in any form, including, but not limited to, petroleum, fuel oil, sludge, oil refuse, and oil mixed with
wastes other than dredged spoil.

On-Scene Commander--The person designated to coordinate the rescue efforts at the rescue site (JCS Publication 1-02).
The senior member, normally the installation or combat support group commander, of the disaster control group. All
disaster response force members at an accident scene are under the command and control of the on-scene commander.
During a HAZMAT incident response where the Disaster Control Group is activated, all disaster response force members
are under the command and control of the OSC. The senior fire official will serve as the OSC until a designated OSC
arrives and is briefed on the situation. Under 40 CFR 300, the National Contingency Plan, the term OSC designates a
federal on-scene coordinator. Because DOD provides their own coordinator, the on-scene commander fills this role.

Parts Per Million (ppm)--Parts of contaminants per million parts of air or liquid by volume.

Parts Per Billion (ppb)--Parts of contaminants per billion parts of air or liquid by volume.
Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL)--An exposure limit established by OSHA and have the force of law. PELs can be
found in 29 CFR 1910.1000, Subpart Z, General Industry Standards for Toxic and Hazardous Substances. They are
expressed as either 8-hour time weighted averages (TWA), ceiling limits (TLV-C), or short term exposure limits (STEL).
Release--Any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching,
dumping, or disposing into the environment (including the abandonment or discarding of barrels, containers, and other
closed receptacles) of any hazardous chemical, extremely hazardous substance, or toxic chemical.

Reportable Quantity--For any CERCLA [The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
of 1980, as amended] hazardous substance, the reportable quantity is that listed in the "Final RQ" column of table 302.4 in
40 CFR 302. For an EPCRA [Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act] extremely hazardous substance,
the reported quantity is that listed in the "Reportable Quantity" column of appendix A or appendix B in 40 CFR 355.
Threshold Limit Value (TLV)--A TLV is a recommended guideline for good practice published by the American
Conference of Governmental Hygienists (ACGIH). TLVs refer to airborne concentrations of substances and represent
conditions under which it is believed that nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed without adverse health effects.
TLVs are intended for use by individuals trained in the practice of industrial hygiene; therefore, individuals should seek
further information from their installation bioenvironmental engineering services. TLVs are expressed as 8-hour TWAs,
ceiling values, or short term exposure limits.
Threshold Limit Value Time Weighted Average (TLV-TWA)--The time weighted average concentration for a normal 8-
hour workday and a 40-hour workweek, to which all workers may be repeatedly exposed, day after day, without adverse
effect.
Threshold Limit Value Short Term Exposure Limit (TLV-STEL)--A 15 minute TWA exposure which should not be
exceeded at any time during the workday. Exposures above the TLV-TWA should not be longer than 15 minutes nor occur
more than four times per day, with at least 60 minutes between occurrences. It supplements the TLV-TWA where there are
recognized acute effects from a substance whose toxic effects are primarily of a chronic nature.
Threshold Limit Value Ceiling (TLV-C)--Concentration in air that should not be exceeded during any part of a working
exposure. Ceiling limits may supplement other units or stand alone.

                                                    INTRODUCTION

Section A--Background

1.1. Objective. The United States Air Force is committed to proper management of the hazardous wastes that are
generated on its installations. The primary objective of this document is to provide a management plan that gives personnel
involved with hazardous waste the essential tools for effective management.

1.2. Effective Dates. On May 19, 1980, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published the hazardous waste
management system rules. Subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, directed the EPA to promulgate these rules and regulations to protect human
health and the environment from the improper management of hazardous waste. The effective date of these far-reaching
regulations was November 19, 1980. RCRA was again amended in 1984. The amendments require increased management
of hazardous waste by all organizations on Andrews Air Force Base (AAFB). Because the State has developed a program to
implement the RCRA requirements, the EPA has delegated RCRA implementation to the State. The Federal Facility
Compliance Act (FFCA) of 1992 requires all DoD facilities to comply with all applicable Federal, state, interstate, and local
environmental regulations in the same manner as private facilities. The FFCA allows Federal and state agencies to assess
fines against DoD facilities with RCRA violations. The procedures of this plan will be used to comply with Federal and
state legislation and regulations. Plan revisions shall reflect changes in either level of hazardous waste management laws
and regulations. Each revision to this plan will become effective immediately upon distribution unless otherwise noted
herein.

1.3. Implementation. Implementation of the comprehensive hazardous waste management program mandated by RCRA
requires maximum cooperation of all activities on AAFB. It is the responsibility of the installation commander to ensure
compliance with all RCRA requirements for AAFB and to notify, apply for permits, and report to EPA or the State, as
required, for all installation activities, including tenant activities. The individual base operational units (generating
activities) are accountable for conducting their activities in accordance with this plan. Those base units, including
supporting Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service activities and tenant activities, will provide necessary
documentation to the installation commander through the Environmental Protection Committee for permit application,
provide the reports required by EPA or the State, and ensure compliance with RCRA regulations and permit requirements at
the facility.

Section B--Scope of the Hazardous Waste Management Program

1.4. Applicability to AAFB. This plan deals with key points in implementing the complex area of hazardous waste
management required by RCRA as enforced by the EPA at Federal facilities such as AAFB. Federal facilities are not
exempt from most of the requirements of this law. The plan covers the control and management of hazardous wastes at the
point where they are generated from hazardous materials to the point of ultimate disposal. This plan implements the EPA’s
philosophy of “cradle-to-grave” management and control of hazardous waste.

1.5. Applicability of State Requirements. This plan also addresses mandatory requirements of the state of State
Hazardous Waste Management regulations. AAFB is not exempt from state regulations which have been authorized by
EPA to implement RCRA requirements in this state.

Section A--Tasked Organizations.

2.1. Overview. Responsibilities for implementing this plan are distributed throughout base organizations that generate,
accumulate, store, transport, turn-in, monitor, treat, dispose of, or respond to incidents involving hazardous waste.
Compliance with Federal, State, and local hazardous waste laws and regulations is the responsibility of the installation
commander through the Environmental Protection Committee (EPC). The development, maintenance, and implementation
of this plan is the result of Andrews AFB Environmental Protection Committee action. The following organizations are
tasked under this plan: Tactical Training Wing (EPC Chairperson); Civil Engineer Squadron; Supply Squadron;
Transportation Squadron; Training Group; Medical Group; Aircraft Generation Squadron; Component Repair Squadron;
Equipment Maintenance Squadron; Tactical Air Control Wing; Tactical Air Support Squadron; Defense Reutilization and
Marketing Office (DRMO); Det. 1, Fighter Interceptor Group; Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center; Electronic

       ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE HAZARDOUS WASTE STREAM INVENTORY AND LOCATIONS

Section A--Hazardous Waste Locations

3.1. Hazardous Waste Accumulation Map. The map on page 117 shows areas and buildings at AAFB where hazardous
wastes are initially accumulated (initial accumulation points), accumulated by the generating activities for up to 90 days
from the time the first volume of hazardous waste is placed in a container or moved into the areas by the generating
activities (accumulation sites), and the building where hazardous waste may be stored for longer periods of time prior to
disposal (permitted storage).

3.2. Hazardous Waste Accumulation Areas.
3.2.1. An initial accumulation point is an area where waste is initially accumulated under control of the shop supervisor of
the process generating the waste. The maximum volume of hazardous waste permitted at each initial accumulation point is
55 gallons or one quart of acute hazardous waste on the P-list. Once one of these limits is exceeded, the waste must be
moved to its designated waste accumulation site. Their are four initial accumulation points for hazardous waste at Andrews
Air Force Base. The areas designated as initial accumulation points are identified below in Table 3.1. If an additional
initial accumulation point is needed, a location near the area where the waste is generated will be selected by the area
accumulation site manager who will notify the Environmental Manager.

 Table 3.1. AAFB Hazardous Waste Initial Accumulation Points.

3.2.2. A hazardous waste accumulation site is an area near the waste generating activity where hazardous waste is
accumulated in containers or tanks for a period of up to 90 days. AAFB only accumulates hazardous waste in containers.
There are three accumulation sites for hazardous waste at AAFB. The areas designated for the accumulation of hazardous
waste are identified below in Table 3.2. If an additional accumulation site is needed, a location near the area where the
waste is generated will be selected by the area accumulation site manager in coordination with the Environmental Manager
who will ensure that the area selected and the design of the accumulation site minimizes the threat of the waste to human
health or the environment.

3.2.3. A permitted storage facility is an area in which a facility has been granted a permit to store hazardous waste in
accordance with permit STATED1234567890. DRMO operates the hazardous waste storage facility in Building 198. The
permit should be referred to for specific operating procedures and restrictions. Wastes restricted from land disposal may be
stored at this facility for up to one year. It is the policy of AAFB to ship hazardous waste off-site as expeditiously as
possible.
116                                                                   AFPAM 32-7043 Attachment 2 1 November 1995


Section B--Hazardous Waste Steam Inventory

3.3.     Responsibilities.
3.3.1. Andrews Air Force Base maintains a hazardous waste stream inventory for every hazardous waste stream generated
on base. Bioenvironmental Engineering Services (BES) is the office of primary responsibility for the AAFB hazardous
waste stream inventory. AAFB will not handle, store, transport, dispose of or inventory non-DOD owned hazardous wastes
or materials except as authorized.
3.3.2. AAFB will ensure that all wastes are properly characterized and classified as either hazardous or non-hazardous
wastes in accordance with the AAFB Waste Analysis Plan (See Chapter 4). Hazardous wastes will be characterized on the
DRMS Form 1930, Hazardous Waste Profile Sheet. Information from the hazardous waste profile sheet will be used by
Bioenvironmental Engineering Services to maintain and update the hazardous waste stream inventory. The accumulation
site manager is responsible for quantifying all hazardous waste streams for the hazardous waste stream inventory.
3.3.3. Hazardous waste generating activities will identify and separately document wastes which are classified as non-
hazardous due to the following:
   • subject to solid or hazardous waste exclusions (40 CFR § 261.4);
   • recycled, not subject to the generator waste determination requirements of 40 CFR § 262.11 (e.g., lead acid batteries
       that are being reclaimed, used oil that is burned for energy recovery, and scrap metal which is recycled) (40 CFR §
       261.6);
   • land disposal restricted waste that is excluded from the definition of hazardous or solid waste or exempt from Subtitle
       C regulations under 40 CFR 261.2-261.6 subsequent to the point of generation, to document the waste, its exclusion
       or exemption, and the disposition of the waste.
3.3.4. The hazardous waste generating activity of an area generating an excluded, exempt, or recycled waste will place a
one-time notice stating such generation, the subsequent exclusion from the definition of solid or hazardous waste or
exemption from Subtitle C regulation, and the disposition of the waste in the generating activity's waste management file.
A copy of the document will be forwarded to the Environmental Manager and maintained on-site for at least five years from
the date the waste was last sent to on-site or off-site treatment, storage, or disposal.

                              ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE WASTE ANALYSIS PLAN

4.1. Background Information.
4.1.1. Federal and State Requirements. This is the waste analysis plan for Andrews Air Force Base as required by 40
CFR § 264.13(a), (b), and (c), 40 CFR § 268.7, 40 CFR § 270.14(b)(5), State Regulations, and Air Force Policy. The waste
analysis plan applies to all AAFB hazardous waste streams that are transferred to the DRMO-operated permitted storage
area (building 198).
4.1.2. Andrews Air Force Base Plan Contents. To comply with Federal and State RCRA requirements, this plan
contains base procedures for identifying and evaluating hazardous waste streams in order to complete a hazardous waste
profile sheet on each hazardous waste stream. The waste analysis plan describes detailed procedures for obtaining physical
and chemical analyses from all associated waste generating activities at AAFB including procedures for selecting waste
parameters for analysis, selecting waste sampling methods, documenting samples, identifying analytical methods, selecting
facilities for analyzing samples, and reevaluating hazardous waste streams.
4.1.3. Waste Steam Inventory. The AAFB hazardous waste stream inventory lists all hazardous waste streams transferred
to Building 198 and other hazardous waste streams where storage in excess of 90 days is not permitted. The hazardous
waste process codes used in the hazardous waste stream inventory can be cross-referenced to the waste analysis plan
procedures to identify the sampling and analytical procedures which apply to specific hazardous waste streams generated at
AAFB.

4.2. Hazardous Waste Characterization Process.
4.2.1. Hazardous waste characterization will involve three sequential steps: 1) waste identification, 2) waste description, 3)
waste quantification.
4.2.1.1. Waste Identification.
4.2.1.1.1. Waste identification is a process in which all newly generated wastes at AAFB are evaluated to determine
whether the waste is hazardous or non-hazardous. Waste identification also involves classifying hazardous wastes. This
process can be conducted either by using the waste generator’s knowledge of the waste or by analytical testing. In either
case, all evaluations must be based on the EPA solid waste and hazardous waste definitions. Analytical testing is required
at Andrews Air Force Base for all waste streams which are chemical mixtures. Testing is not normally required for waste,
unused, commercial chemical products or laboratory chemicals in their original, marked containers.
4.2.1.1.2. Bioenvironmental Engineering Services will determine if the generator’s knowledge of the waste is sufficient to
characterize the waste. The generating activity should request a hazardous waste determination through the Environmental
Manager to Bioenvironmental Engineering Services. If testing is needed, Bioenvironmental Engineering Services will
arrange for sample and analysis. Sampling and analysis must be conducted in accordance with the requirements specified
in EPA publication SW-864 and this waste analysis plan. All sampling and analysis costs will be funded from the
installation operations and maintenance funds.
4.2.1.1.3. The waste generating activity should ask the following questions to determine if they have a hazardous waste
stream which requires further evaluation:
4.2.1.1.3.1. Is it a waste? If the answer to any of the following four questions is yes, the material is a waste.
   • Is the material no longer useful for its intended purpose because it is dirty, out of specification, or a spill residue?
   • Is it an unintended or unusable byproduct?
   • Does the base intend to discard the material for eventual treatment, storage, recycling, or disposal?
   • Is it produced by cleanup at a previously uncontrolled waste site?
4.2.1.1.3.2. Is it a solid waste? A solid waste is generally defined as any discarded material (including solids, liquids, and
containerized gases) which is abandoned, recycled, or considered inherently waste-like.
4.2.1.1.3.3. Is it a hazardous waste? If the material is a solid waste, the solid waste must be evaluated to determine if it is
a hazardous waste. A material is a hazardous waste if it has not been excluded from regulation and is a characteristic
hazardous waste (e.g., ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic), a listed hazardous waste, or a mixture of a listed hazardous
waste and solid waste. This evaluation can be conducted by either using the waste generator's knowledge of the hazardous
characteristics of the waste in light of the materials or processes used, or by analytical testing as described 40 CFR 261 and
this waste analysis plan.
4.2.1.2. Waste Description. The analytical results must be interpreted to determine if tested waste streams are hazardous
according to 40 CFR Part 261 or State definitions. Bioenvironmental Engineering Services is responsible for interpreting
the analytical test results for the Environmental Manager. Bioenvironmental Engineering Services should mark the test
results as "HAZARDOUS WASTE" or "NOT HAZARDOUS WASTE" after making a determination. The analytical

results as well as the generating activities waste process knowledge will be used to complete the hazardous waste profile
sheet. The generating activity will obtain assistance in completing the hazardous waste profile sheet from the
Environmental Manager, Bioenvironmental Engineering Services, and the Base Transportation Officer.
4.2.1.3. Waste Quantification. The final step is determining the amount of hazardous waste generated each year, which is
documented in the hazardous waste inventory (see Chapter 3).

4.3. Test Methods Used.
4.3.1. Waste Stream Screening. Three industrial work centers at AAFB generate wastes; all waste is transferred to
Building 198. All new waste streams must be evaluated by the generating activity as soon as they are generated and prior to
leaving the waste generating area.

4.3.2. Waste Parameter Selection.
4.3.2.1. Table 4.1 lists all of the existing wastes streams at AAFB by waste stream number and identifies the specific
parameters that are analyzed for each waste stream. Analytical testing for the specified parameters must be repeated
annually unless the waste generating process or the materials comprising the wastes change. If the waste generating
process or waste characteristics change, the waste must be retested prior to disposal. The parameters selected for new waste
streams will be based on the waste characterization information required in the waste disposal contract for the waste. As a
minimum, new waste streams will be evaluated using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) to determine
toxicity characteristics unless the generator's knowledge of the waste is sufficient to rule out the presence of any of the
toxicity characteristic contaminants.
4.3.2.2. The waste parameters selected above are based on the suspected hazardous waste characteristics of the waste.
   • Flash Point. Flash point is determined through a test procedure which identifies whether a waste is ignitable
       (D001). Ignitable hazardous wastes have flash points less than 140°F. Hazardous waste streams PO-001, PO-002,
       and FC-001 contain varying concentrations of ignitable solvents which have the potential to lower the waste's flash
       point to less than 140°F. Because process knowledge is not adequate to accurately predict flash point, these waste
       must be retested each year by December 1 to determine flash point.
   • BTU Value and Ash Content. The disposal contract through the DRMO for hazardous waste streams PO-001,
       PO-002, and FC-001 specifies that BTU value and ash content will be analyzed each year by December 1 to
       determine if these hazardous waste streams are suitable for fuel blending and use in an energy recovery program. To
       be accepted, these wastes must have a minimum heating value of 5000 BTU/lb and an ash content no higher than 5
       percent.
   • TCLP Metals. If an extract from a representative sample of waste, which when tested in accordance with the
       Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, contains any of the contaminants listed in Table 4.2 at a concentration
       equal to or greater than the regulatory level listed in the table, the waste is a hazardous waste. Toxicity characteristic
       constituents which are metals of concern include arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, selenium, and
       silver. Hazardous waste streams PO-001, PO-002, and AB-001 have the potential to contain lead and
       chromium-based paint pigments and must be analyzed for the TCLP metals each year by December 1.
122                                                                    AFPAM 32-7043 Attachment 2 1 November 1995

  •   TCLP Metals, Volatiles and Semi-Volatiles. Rags from aircraft cleaning operations have the potential to absorb
      toxicity characteristic contaminants such as lead and benzene. A TCLP analysis for all contaminants listed in Table
      4.2 except pesticides will be completed on hazardous waste stream AC-001 each year by December 1.
  •   1,1,1-Trichloroethane Concentration. Spent 1,1,1-trichloroethane used for cleaning and degreasing is a listed
      hazardous waste (F001). If waste rags contain any detectable concentration of spent 1,1,1-trichloroethane, they also
      must be classified as an F001 waste. Waste rags soaked with this solvent will be analyzed annually to determine
      their 1,1,1-trichloroethane concentration and hazardous waste code(s).

4.3.2.3. All new and non-recurring hazardous waste streams, except for laboratory chemicals and unused commercial
chemical products, must be tested in accordance with the TCLP to determine if they exhibit the toxicity characteristic,
except when process knowledge is sufficient to certify that none of the TCLP contaminants could be present. In addition,
the major components of each hazardous waste stream must be defined on the hazardous waste profile sheet. If process
knowledge is insufficient, these wastes will be tested to determine their major components. A major component includes any
hazardous constituent listed in Appendix VIII of 40 CFR Part 261 present over 10,000 ppm (1%). If process knowledge is
insufficient to identify major components, then testing for those components in accordance with the procedures outlined in
EPA's Publication SW-846 will be necessary. Additional testing (e.g., flash point, BTU value, ash content, pH, etc.) will be
based on the testing requirements specified in the disposal contract for the waste.
4.3.2.4. AAFB waste oil and oil filters, which are recycled off-site by being burned for energy recovery, are not regulated as
a hazardous waste if they contain less than 1000 ppm of total halogens. Each batch of waste oil and filters will be screened
for total halogens (TOX) by submitting a representative sample of the waste oil to Bioenvironmental Engineering Services
four weeks prior to pickup by the waste oil hauler. All waste oil is assumed to be off-specification used oil fuel at AAFB in
accordance with EPA regulations in 40 CFR 266.40.

4.4. Analytical Methods.
4.4.1. Several of the parameters specified above will be analyzed using the test methods from EPA’s “Test Methods for
Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods" (EPA Publication SW-846). The SW-846 method numbers are
specified in Table 4.3.
4.4.2. The hazardous waste analysis for all of the above waste streams will be conducted at the Armstrong Laboratory (AL
The AL is accredited by the American Association of Laboratory Accreditation and is approved by the Texas Water
Commission for the analysis of wastewater, hazardous waste, Superfund site, underground injection, and underground
storage tank program samples.

4.5. Hazardous Waste Sampling Methods.
4.5.1. All waste samples will be collected in accordance with procedures specified in this waste analysis plan and the
EPA-specified procedures identified in Table 4.4 to ensure that they are representative of the waste stream.
4.5.2. Both sampling equipment and sample bottles must be clean in order to prevent contamination of the sample. Sample
bottles used for holding samples which will be analyzed for metallics should be cleaned with detergent, rinsed with tap
water, rinsed with 1:1 nitric acid, rinsed with tap water, rinsed with 1:1 hydrochloric acid, rinsed with tap water, and finally
rinsed with Type II deionized water. Sample bottles used for holding samples which will be analyzed for organic
compounds should be washed with detergent, rinsed with tap water, rinsed with distilled, deionized water, and dried at 105°
C for approximately one hour.

 Table 4.4. Representative Sampling Method Protocols.
             Sample Type                               Sampling Method

        lagoons and similar reservoirs

4.5.3. Samples which are to be analyzed for volatiles must be placed in a cooler for storage and shipping to ensure that they
are cooled down to 4°C.
4.5.4. Sampling equipment (e.g., the COLIWASA) must be decontaminated before being reused by washing in a detergent
solution and rinsing. Alternatively, disposable COLIWASAs will be used and disposed of after each sample is collected.
4.5.5. Personnel collecting hazardous waste samples must wear personal protective equipment including impervious gloves,
chemical safety goggles, coveralls, and suitable boots when sampling hazardous waste. Bioenvironmental Engineering
Services should be contacted to determine the proper equipment to be worn when sampling specific waste streams. A
minimum of Level B protection (e.g., chemical splash suit, impervious gloves, impervious outer boots, and a positive
pressure self-contained breathing apparatus) must be worn when sampling unknown wastes streams.

4.6. Sample Analysis Location and Frequency.
4.6.1. Obtaining Samples of Liquid and Semisolid Wastes from Containers (Waste Streams PO-001, PO-002,
FC-001, and waste oil).
4.6.1.1. Each waste stream must be sampled. If the waste stream is contained in several containers, a homogeneous sample
should betaken. If there are a large number of containers, a subset of containers to be sampled will be chosen randomly by
AFPAM 32-7043 Attachment 2 1 November 1995                                                                                    125

using a random number table. Any waste stream container which does not have a valid container log or was not secured to
prevent unauthorized waste from being placed into the container will require separate sampling.
4.6.1.2. Samples will be taken by inserting a COLIWASA through the bung on each drum, allowing the COLIWASA to fill
with the waste, inserting the plug into the end of the COLIWASA, and draining the contents of the COLIWASA into the
precleaned glass sample bottle.
4.6.1.3. It is important to keep air out of samples which will be analyzed for both TCLP and non-TCLP volatile organic
components. A minimum two 100 milliliter samples should be collected in a Teflon-lined, septum-capped vials and stored
and shipped at 4°C prior to analysis. When collecting samples of volatile organics, introduce the materials to the sample
vial gently to reduce agitation which might drive off volatile compounds. Liquid samples should be poured into the sample
vial without introducing any air bubbles within the bottle as it is being filled. Should bubbling occur as a result of violent
pouring, the sample must be poured out and the vial refilled. Each vial should be filled until there is a meniscus over the lip
of the vial. The screw top lid with the septum should then be tightened onto the vial. After tightening the lid, the vial
should be inverted and tapped to check for air bubbles. If there are any air bubbles present, the sample must be retaken.
4.6.2. Obtaining Samples of Free-Flowing Powders from Containers (Waste Stream AB-001).
4.6.2.1. Each waste stream must be sampled. If the waste stream is contained in several containers, a homogeneous sample
should betaken. If there are a large number of containers, a subset of containers to be sampled will be chosen randomly by
using a random number table. Any waste stream container which does not have a valid container log or was not secured to
prevent unauthorized waste from being placed into the container will require separate sampling.
4.6.2.2. A thief sampler will be used to obtain the sample. The sampler will be inserted into the top of the 55-gallon 17H
drum, pushed to the bottom of the drum, rotated several times to allow the sand media and paint chips to flow into the
chamber, removed from the drum, and emptied into the precleaned glass sample bottle.
4.6.2.3. Sampling equipment, (e.g., the thief sampler) must be decontaminated by washing in a detergent solution and
rinsing before being reused.
4.6.3. Obtaining Samples of Rags from Containers (Waste Stream AC-001).
4.6.3.1. Ideally several samples should be taken from locations dispersed both horizontally and vertically through the open
top 55-gallon drums (17H).
4.6.3.2. Sample bottles used for holding samples which will be analyzed for organic compounds should be washed with
detergent, rinsed with tap water, rinsed with distilled, deionized water, and dried at 105°C for approximately one hour.
4.6.3.3. The container to be sampled is divided by using an imaginary three-dimensional grid. Each section and level is
assigned a number and specific sampling locations are selected by using a random number table. A minimum of four rags
should be removed from the randomly selected locations and placed in a precleaned, glass sample bottle with a
septum-capped lid.
4.6.4. Each of the high volume waste streams identified in Table 4.1 will be sampled and the samples analyzed each year
by December 1 in order to update the hazardous waste profile sheet and to ensure that the initial hazardous waste
determinations are accurate and up-to-date. High volume waste streams are defined as those that generate four or more
55-gallon drums of waste per year. All AAFB waste streams are currently classified as high volume.
4.6.4.1. The accumulation site managers will request additional analyses from Bioenvironmental Engineering Services in
accordance with this plan whenever the process or operation generating the hazardous waste stream has changed. Prior to
turning in a waste to DRMO for disposal, the accumulation site manager must review the current hazardous waste profile
sheet to ensure that it still accurately reflects the characteristics, composition, and regulatory classification of the waste. If
there has been a change in the waste stream, additional analyses and an updated hazardous waste profile sheet may be
required.
4.6.4.2. If new waste streams are generated, the accumulation site manager will contact Bioenvironmental Engineering
Services for a determination of the sampling parameters and required analysis. This analysis and a hazardous waste profile
sheet will be completed by the accumulation site manager prior to waste turn-in to the DRMO or any other non-DRMO
disposal agent. The accumulation site manager must also make arrangements through the Environmental Manager for
weighing the waste prior to turn-in.
4.6.4.3. If any newly generated waste is estimated to generate 3 55-gallon drums or less per year, it is considered a low
volume waste stream. It will be sampled and analyzed once every three years after the initial analysis and characterization
unless there is a process change that would dictate a more frequent analysis. An updated hazardous waste profile sheet
must be submitted to the DRMO by December 1 of each year for low volume waste streams, but the reevaluation may be
based on process knowledge after the initial analytical characterization.

4.7. Sample Documentation.
4.7.1. Andrews Air Force Bases uses sample labels, analysis request forms, and chain-of-custody forms for all waste sample
shipments to ensure the integrity of samples from collection to data reporting. The possession and handling of samples
126                                                                      AFPAM 32-7043 Attachment 2 1 November 1995

must be traceable from collection through analysis and final disposition. The documentation of the sample history is called
chain-of-custody.
4.7.1.1. The parts of the chain-of-custody process include the use of sample labels which are placed on containers prior to
sampling and filled out by Bioenvironmental Engineering Services or accumulation site manager at sample collection.
Necessary information on the sample label includes the sample number, name of collector, date and time of collection, and
place of collection.
4.7.1.2. A chain-of-custody record should also be filled out and accompany every sample. This record should contain the
sample number, signature of collector, date and time of collection, place and address of collection, waste type, signature of
persons involved in the chain of custody, and inclusive dates of possession. Bioenvironmental Engineering Services will
provide the Chain-of-Custody form.

4.8. Sample Request Procedures. A sample analysis request form should accompany the sample to the laboratory. The
field portion of the form is completed by the person collecting the sample and should include pertinent information such as
the sample number, the requested analysis, and the name and phone number of the person collecting the sample. The
sample analysis request form will typically be provided by the laboratory conducting the analysis. The laboratory portion of
the form is then completed by laboratory personnel and includes the name of the person receiving the sample, laboratory
sample number, date and time of sample receipt, sample allocation, and analysis to be performed.

4.9. Hazardous Waste Profile Sheet.
4.9.1. After analytical results have been received from the laboratory, the data must be evaluated to determine if the
material is a hazardous waste and to ensure compliance with the AAFB waste analysis plan. Bioenvironmental
Engineering Services should interpret the results for the waste generator, provide a copy of the results to the waste generator
and the Environmental Manager, and keep a copy on file. The file copy should be maintained for at least five years from
the date that the waste was last shipped off-installation, because all waste is land disposal restricted waste.
4.9.1.1. The analytical results are used by the accumulation site manager to complete a comprehensive waste stream
description which is recorded on the hazardous waste profile sheet. All analytical results from waste evaluation activities
should be attached to the hazardous waste profile sheet.
4.9.1.2. A sample hazardous waste profile sheet for waste stream AB-001 is presented in Figure 4.1.
4.9.2. The hazardous waste profile sheet is the standard form which must be used for characterizing hazardous waste for all
disposal actions, regardless of whether or not the DRMO in Building 198 is the disposal agent. The hazardous waste profile
sheet is available from the local DRMO. If the local DRMO is not the disposal agent, the hazardous waste profile sheet can
be obtained from the base Environmental Manager.
4.9.2.1. The DRMO uses the information that is contained on the hazardous waste profile sheet to alert disposal contractors
of possible disposal restrictions. The DRMO representative assigns an initial reference number to each hazardous waste
profile sheet. Subsequent turn-ins of the same waste do not require that the hazardous waste profile sheet accompany the
waste. Instead, the generating activity simply places the reference number in the “Remarks” section (block AA) of the
Disposal Turn-In Document (DTID).
4.9.2.2. The accumulation site managers can obtain base support for completing the profile sheet as follows:
  • The Environmental Manager (CEV) will advise on completion of Part I and is responsible for completing
       information required by EPA land disposal restrictions on the hazardous waste profile sheet. The Environmental
       Manager is also responsible for reviewing the hazardous waste profile sheet for accuracy based on the best available
       information. Only when the waste has been properly characterized on the hazardous waste profile sheet should the
       DTID be certified by the Environmental Manager. The Environmental Manager must maintain a copy of each
       hazardous waste profile sheet in the hazardous waste file for the installation for at least five years from the final date
       of disposal of the waste stream.
  • Base Bioenvironmental Engineering Services (BES) will advise on completion of the health and hazardous waste
       identification portions of the hazardous waste profile sheet in Part II, Sections 1-4 and the special handling
       information in Section 5. Bioenvironmental Engineering Services also reviews the hazardous waste profile sheet for
       technical accuracy when requested by the Environmental Manager. Bioenvironmental Engineering Services should
       also maintain a copy of each hazardous waste profile sheet in the generating activities’shop folder for five years.
  • The Base Transportation Officer will advise on completion of the proper shipping information, containers, and
       transportation requirements of Part II, Section 5 of the hazardous waste profile sheet.
  • The generating activity will submit an updated hazardous waste profile sheet to the disposal agent by 1 December of
       each year or whenever the waste stream changes regardless of whether the waste stream was analyzed during the past
       year.

4.10. Waste Analysis Plan Revision.
4.10.1. The AAFB waste analysis plan will be evaluated and reviewed annually by BES to ensure that the most up-to-date
procedures are conducted. The plan will also be reviewed and revised whenever:
  • sample frequencies change due to annual volume of installation’s hazardous waste streams,
  • analytical parameters change due to changes in the processes generating hazardous waste,
  • EPA hazardous waste numbers and/or UN/NA identification numbers change due to regulatory revisions, and
  • disposal methods change due to revisions to land disposal restrictions or changes in disposal contracts.

             ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES

5.1. Specific Waste Management Procedures. Hazardous waste is temporarily stored at AAFB at facilities within the
following three classifications: initial accumulation points, accumulation sites, and at the permitted storage building.
Hazardous waste may only be accumulated and temporarily stored at the pre-designated areas shown in Figure 3.1 or at
initial accumulation points located in the same area where the wastes are first accumulated. Each type of accumulation area
must comply with the associated requirements outlined below.

5.2. Permitted Storage Facility. DRMO operates a hazardous waste storage facility on AAFB in Building 198. This
facility is permitted to store hazardous waste in accordance with permit STD123456789. The permit application should be
referenced for specific operating procedures and restrictions.

5.3. Accumulation Site Management.
5.3.1. Each accumulation site must comply with the requirements for siting, physical construction, operations, marking,
labeling, inspections, and maintaining a container log.
5.3.1.1. The area used for the accumulation of hazardous waste should be one of the areas specified in Table 3.2. If an
additional accumulation site is required, a location shall be selected in coordination with the Base Environmental Manager
which minimizes the threat of the waste to human health or the environment in the event of a release of the hazardous
waste.
5.3.1.2. AAFB will comply with the following physical requirements for accumulation sites.
5.3.1.2.1. EPA requirements for the location and design of accumulation sites will be met.
5.3.1.2.2. State requirements for the location and design of accumulation sites will be met.
5.3.1.2.3. Accumulation site managers must obtain pre-approval by the Fire Protection Flight, Ground Safety,
Bioenvironmental Engineering Services and the Environmental Manager for the location of new accumulation sites.
Approval must take into consideration potential environmental consequences if hazardous waste is released from the
accumulation site during a spill, release, fire or explosion.
5.3.1.2.4. Containers holding ignitable or reactive wastes must be located at least 15 meters (50 feet) inside the AAFB
property boundary.
5.3.1.2.5. The construction of each accumulation site must include an impermeable base or containment system which is
capable of preventing environmental contamination due to container overfilling or leaks. Concrete containments shall be
treated with a sealant to prevent spills from absorbing into or passing through the concrete. Containers shall not be placed
on dirt, sand, gravel, or grass surfaces.
5.3.1.2.6. Containers shall not be located near any floor drains that lead to sanitary or storm water sewers.
5.3.1.2.7. The base of the containment system shall be sloped to a sump so liquids resulting from leaks, spills, or
precipitation are drained and removed.
5.3.1.2.8. Different types of hazardous waste must be accumulated in separate containers. Non-hazardous waste must not
be mixed with hazardous waste. For example, waste oil, waste paints, and waste abrasive blasting media, etc. should each
be accumulated in separate containers.
5.3.1.2.9. For incompatible wastes, segregated containment must be provided by using either separate containment areas or
by means of separately diked areas, or sloped containment to separate sumps. Hazardous chemical reactions which cause
heat, fire, explosion, pressure, or the evolution of toxic or flammable decomposition products due to incompatible chemical
reactions must be prevented. If unsure whether a waste to be disposed of or placed in a container is compatible with the
waste in the container itself, contact the Environmental Manager or Bioenvironmental Engineering Services before placing
waste in the container. Incompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and materials must not be placed in the same
container. In addition, hazardous waste must not be placed in an unwashed container that previously held an incompatible
waste or material.
5.3.1.2.10. Hazardous wastes must not be located near anything with which they are incompatible. For example, lead-acid
batteries should not be located near any aluminum structures or surfaces because contact between acid and aluminum may
produce flammable hydrogen gas and could lead to a fire or explosion. Containers holding hazardous waste which is
incompatible with any other wastes or materials present should be physically separated from the other materials by means of
a dike, berm, or wall.
5.3.1.2.11. Containment systems should be designed and operated to prevent run-on into the container area or with enough
excess capacity (beyond that needed for the waste) so any run-on will be contained. Spilled or leaked waste and
accumulated precipitation must be removed from the system as soon as it is identified to prevent container corrosion or
AFPAM 32-7043 Attachment 2 1 November 1995                                                                                  131

mixing with wastes. Accumulated precipitation must be checked prior to discharge to ensure that it does not contain
hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents.
5.3.1.2.12. In areas where unauthorized access to the accumulation site by persons not authorized to accumulate waste in
the containers is possible, security must be provided by a fence or similar access control device. Post signs that read
"Danger - Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out" in English and any other language predominant in the area that can be seen
from any access and large enough to be read at 25 feet.
5.3.1.2.13. “No Smoking” signs must be placed conspicuously wherever there is a hazard from ignitable or reactive waste.
5.3.1.2.14. At outdoor accumulation sites, containers shall be protected from direct sunlight and precipitation by means of a
roof, tarpaulin, or similar device.
5.3.1.2.15. Indoor accumulation sites shall be well ventilated. Highly volatile organics in particular can present a serious
health hazard when in storage. Also, in the event of a spill or leak, effective ventilation should be installed to safely direct
toxic or flammable vapors and fumes out of the work area. Care must be taken to prevent exhausted air from reentering
work areas through doors, windows, and air intakes on buildings.
5.3.1.2.16. Drums must be placed on pallets to allow for ease of removal when full and to keep them away from
accumulated precipitation or spills.
5.3.1.3. Operating Requirements for Accumulation Sites.
5.3.1.3.1. Containers used to store hazardous waste must be kept closed at all times, except for when waste is actually being
added to or removed from the container. In general, a container is closed if its original closures, such as bung caps or drum
heads, are secured to the container. Therefore, a closed-head 55-gallon drum should have its original (or equivalent
replacement) bung caps screwed tightly into the bung openings. During storage, an open-head 55-gallon drum should have
its drum head in place with the retaining ring properly secured with the appropriate nut and bolt. Any other types of
containers used to store hazardous waste should be kept closed in a similar manner.
5.3.1.3.2. Containers must not be stored or handled in a manner which may cause them to rupture or leak. The following
precautions should be taken at both accumulation sites and initial accumulation points to prevent container ruptures and
leaks:
   • Containers must not be overfilled; fill to 90% of capacity. For example, only fill a 55-gallon drum to 50 gallons.
        Liquids expand in containers as the temperature increases. A steel drum painted a dark color can easily rise to
        temperatures above 100 °F and the pressure created by the expansion of the liquid causes bulging heads and damages
        the integrity of the container. Bulging containers also create a safety hazard for personnel expected to add waste to
        or handle the containers.
   • Containers must be protected from freezing during cold weather. Many materials go through a freeze/thaw cycle
        during changing weather conditions. This freeze/thaw cycle causes metal stress and can result in leaking containers.
   • Containers of ignitable hazardous waste must be grounded. Grounding will prevent build-up of static electricity
        which may create a spark capable of igniting flammable vapors. When transferring flammable liquids into
        containers, use a bonding wire to connect the container you are pouring from to the container you are pouring into to
        prevent sparks caused by the build-up of static electricity during pouring operations. Contact the installation fire
        department for grounding and bonding instructions.
   • Drums and other containers must be handled and transported with equipment designed for the task. Drum grappler
        attachments may be purchased for tow motors to securely grab and move containers. Secure containers to pallets
        before moving pallets. Use drum carts designed for the types of containers used by your organization to reduce the
        likelihood of dropping a container during handling. Never balance drums on the forks of a forklift or tow motor.
   • Use a funnel to fill closed head containers. This will ensure that all waste is poured into the container and does not
        spill on the top of the container. If using a funnel without a locking top, the funnel should be removed and the
        container closed after filling. If the funnel has any hazardous waste residues remaining, the residues should be
        rinsed into the container or the funnel placed in a suitable closed hazardous waste accumulation container.
   • Drums must not be stacked more than two high. Drums containing flammable liquids should not be stacked.
   • Containers should be stored in an area which is well away from or protected from damage due to the movement of
        vehicles such as trucks, fork lifts, POVs etc.
5.3.1.4. Container marking during waste accumulation, shall consist of the following information:
   • The words “HAZARDOUS WASTE”;
   • Waste description and principal contaminants;
   • National Stock Number (if applicable) of predominant waste(s) in the container;
   • Organization name, shop code, name of accumulation site manager;
   • Accumulation start date; and
   • The AAFB-assigned container number.
132                                                                     AFPAM 32-7043 Attachment 2 1 November 1995

5.3.1.5. Additional container marking prior to transferring the waste to DRMO or prior to shipping off-base shall consist of
the following information required by EPA and DoT. All marks must be durable, in English, and printed on or affixed to
the surface of a package or on a label, tag or sign, displayed on a background of sharply contrasting color, unobscured by
labels or other attachments and located away from any other marking, such as advertising, that might substantially reduce
its visibility or effectiveness. Each container (also referred to as package) shall be marked with the following information.
5.3.1.5.1. Items in paragraph 5.3.1.4 above shall remain on the container.
5.3.1.5.2. The proper shipping name and the corresponding UN or NA identification number must be marked on each
package of hazardous waste. The proper shipping name is on the hazardous waste profile sheets. Chapter 3 of the Air
Force Hazardous Waste Management Guide, AFPAM 32-7043 provides a method for determining the proper shipping
name and UN or NA identification number for new hazardous wastes.
5.3.1.5.3. Packages containing hazardous substances (see Chapter 3 of the Air Force Hazardous Waste Management Guide
for definition) must be marked with the package with the letters "RQ" in association with the proper shipping name. If the
proper shipping name does not identify the hazardous substance by name, also mark the package with one of the following:
   • The name of the hazardous substance as shown in the Appendix to the Hazardous Materials Table;
   • The EPA hazardous waste number; or
   • For characteristic hazardous wastes, the word "ignitability," "corrosivity," "reactivity," "toxicity," or the
        corresponding "D" hazardous waste number.
5.3.1.5.4. When shipping overpacks or other packages with inside packaging containing liquid hazardous wastes, mark the
outside package with an arrow symbol indicating "This Way Up."
5.3.1.5.5. Wastes and materials which are a poison inhalation hazard (special provision codes in column 7 of the
Hazardous Materials Table of 1 - 6 and 18) must be marked "Poison - Inhalation Hazard".
5.3.1.5.6. The EPA hazard warning must be marked on each container of 110 gallons or less. The EPA hazard warning
(preprinted labels can be purchased commercially) contains the wording shown in figure 5.1.

Figure 5.1. EPA Hazardous Waste Mark.

             HAZARDOUS WASTE - Federal Law Prohibits Improper Disposal.
               If found, contact the nearest police or public safety authority or
                          the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
      Generator's Name and Address: ____________________________________
      Manifest Document Number: ______________________________________

5.3.1.6. Containers shall be labeled in accordance with the following requirements prior to transfer to DRMO or prior to
shipment off-site.
5.3.1.6.1. DoT hazardous materials warning labels which represent the hazard of the material being shipped must be
affixed to containers before being offered for transportation. It is the responsibility of the generating activity to determine
whether or not labels are required, any multiple labeling requirements, and the proper location of the labels on the package.
5.3.1.6.2. The following steps should be followed to determine and affix the proper DoT label for hazardous waste
shipments in containers, packages, overpacks, or freight containers.
   • Locate the hazardous material description as listed in column 2 of the Hazardous Materials Table at 49 CFR 172.101.
   • Locate the hazard class (or classes) for the material corresponding to the hazardous materials description in column 3
       of the table. Definitions of DoT hazard classes are included in 49 CFR Parts 171-173.
   • Locate the hazard label required for each package, as listed in column 6 of the Hazardous Materials Table.
   • Place hazard labels on each container next to the proper shipping name marked.
5.3.1.6.3. Some hazardous material descriptions have more than one hazard class listed in the Hazardous Materials Table.
A waste may exhibit one or more of these hazard classes. If the container being shipped contains waste exhibiting only one
of the hazard classes listed in the table, the appropriate label should be affixed to the container. If the container contains
waste meeting the definition of more than one hazard class, multiple labels are required. Multiple labels must be located
next to one another
5.3.1.6.4. Combustible liquids in packages do not require labels.
5.3.1.7. All hazardous waste accumulation sites must be inspected at least weekly (AAFB does not routinely accumulate or
store hazardous waste in tanks; if tanks are ever used for this purpose, the tanks will be inspected daily). During the
inspection, areas where containers are stored must be examined to look for leaking containers and deterioration of
containers and deterioration of the area in which the containers are placed. Each inspection must be documented and will
AFPAM 32-7043 Attachment 2 1 November 1995                                                                                 133

include the name of the inspector, the location of the accumulation site, date, time of the inspection, problems that the
inspector should be looking for, and a description of actions taken to correct problems when they are detected. The
Environmental Manager will identify the required accumulation site inspection records to be used at AAFB. Inspection
records must be maintained by each accumulation site manager for at least three years from the date of each inspection.
5.3.1.7.1. Inspections of hazardous waste accumulation sites are the responsibility of the accumulation site manager;
however, the Environmental Manager will periodically verify that inspections are being conducted by auditing the
inspection file of each accumulation site manager.
5.3.1.7.2. The Environmental Manager shall also visit each accumulation site at least quarterly to ensure that the
containers and the accumulation area are in good condition and are in compliance with all applicable regulatory
requirements, which include the following:
     • The preparedness and prevention requirements of 40 CFR 265, Subpart C;
     • The container requirements of 40 CFR 265, Subpart I;
     • The tank systems requirements of 40 CFR 265, Subpart J; and
     • The generator pretransportation requirements of 40 CFR 262, Subpart C.
5.3.1.8. Accumulation Site Container Log. To account for all drums at an accumulation site, AAFB accumulation site
managers will maintain an accumulation site container log. The accumulation site container log shown in figure 5.2 is used
to record a container identification number assigned to the container by the accumulation site manager and the waste stream
number of the waste in each container. The following data should be recorded on the log.
5.3.1.8.1. The column "Container Number" represents a unique number assigned to each container. The numbering system
should identify the waste stream as well as the individual identity of each container generated by the waste generating
activity. For example, code "AB-001-037" references the 37th drum of paint chips generated by the abrasive blasting
process.
5.3.1.8.2. The column "Waste Steam" is used to enter a brief description of the hazardous waste in each container.
5.3.1.8.3. The column "Start Date" represents one of the following dates. If waste is being added to a container at an
accumulation site, enter the date the first volume of waste was added to the container. If a 55-gallon container is filled at a
initial accumulation point and subsequently moved to the accumulation site, enter the date the container was filled to
capacity.
5.3.1.8.4. "Date Full" is the date the container was filled to capacity.
5.3.1.8.5. "Date Transferred" is a record of the date the container was transferred to DRMO or was shipped from the
accumulation site for treatment, storage or disposal.
5.3.1.8.6. “Shipped To” is a log of the location to which the container was shipped.

5.4. Initial Accumulation Points. An initial accumulation point is an area at or near the point of hazardous waste
generation which has fewer requirements than those provided for accumulation sites, provided the following restrictions are
met.
5.4.1. Hazardous waste accumulation is under the control of the operator of the process generating the waste.
5.4.2. Not more than 55 gallons of hazardous waste or 1 quart of acute hazardous waste may be accumulated. The 55-
gallon limit applies to the total of all the non-acutely hazardous waste accumulated (includes all waste streams combined) at
the initial accumulation point.

5.4.3. Hazardous waste may be accumulated indefinitely until either of the restrictions in items a or b are exceeded.
5.4.4. Initial accumulation points must comply with the following requirements.
134                                                                   AFPAM 32-7043 Attachment 2 1 November 1995

5.4.4.1. Hazardous waste at initial accumulation points must be collected in containers, not tanks.
5.4.4.2. If the 55-gallon limit is exceeded at a initial accumulation point, the container holding the waste must be marked
with the date the excess began accumulating. Within three days the waste must be transferred to either an accumulation site
or to the permitted hazardous waste storage facility (Building 198). If over 55 gallons of hazardous waste remains at a
initial accumulation point beyond this time limit, the initial accumulation point is regulated under the more stringent
requirements for accumulation sites.
5.4.4.3. Each initial accumulation point must also comply with the requirements for accumulation sites in paragraph 5.3.1.
above.
     • Paragraphs 5.3.1.2.4, 5.3.1.2.6, 5.3.1.2.8 through 5.3.1.2.10, and 5.3.1.2.13 through 5.3.1.2.16 regarding the
          physical requirements for accumulation sites.
     • Paragraphs 5.3.1.3.1 through 5.3.1.3.3 regarding operating requirements for accumulation sites.
     • Paragraph 5.3.1.4 regarding container marking during accumulation.
     • Paragraph 5.3.1.5 regarding container marking prior to turn-in.
     • Paragraph 5.3.1.6 regarding container labeling prior to turn-in.

5.5.     Hazardous Waste Turn-in to DRMO. After temporary accumulation at the point of generation, most hazardous
waste generated at AAFB is transferred to DRMO which operates a permitted storage facility in Building 198. Turn-in of
hazardous waste requires three documents; an up-to-date hazardous waste profile sheet, AF Form 2005, and DD Form
1348-1.
5.5.1. All transfers of hazardous waste to the DRMO storage facility must be conducted under the direction of and
processed through the Environmental Manager. This procedure will prevent unnecessary waste analyses and handling of
the waste. It also provides for an accurate accounting of fund expenditures.
5.5.2. Before turning in hazardous waste, the waste generator should complete an AF Form 2005 (figure 5.3) in
cooperation with the Environmental Manager and Base Supply. The Environmental Manager will provide oversight and
assistance in completion of the AF Form 2005 and waste turn-in, as follows.
  • Assist in determining the EPA hazardous waste number. Bioenvironmental Engineering Services may be consulted
       for assistance in this determination.
  • Identify the cost of disposal and unit of issue (which are used to establish the hazardous waste item record in supply).
       The disposal price and unit of issue are obtained from the applicable DRMO disposal contract. The unit price
       represents the cost, per unit of issue, to dispose of the specific waste.
  • Inspect the waste and certify that the waste is identified, packed, marked and labeled in accordance with federal and
       state hazardous waste management or toxic substance control regulations. This certification must be on or
       accompany the turn-in document (DD Form 1348-1) before it is received by DRMO. If the waste is not properly
       identified, packed, marked or labeled, it is the responsibility of the generating activity to make appropriate
       corrections or repackaging, as identified by the environmental function.

 Table 5.1. Common Federal Stock Classes.
         9150  Petroleum, oils, lubricants                     8010     Paints, waste paint related material
         6350  Antifreeze, windshield washer fluid             6850     Solvents
         5950  Transformers                                    9999     Spill residue

5.5.3. The specific entries to be completed by the generator on the AF Form 2005 include the following.
        • Enter “TIN” in blocks 1-3 to designate a turn-in action.
        • Enter the Stock Number in positions 8-22. The Stock Number contains the Federal Stock Class in positions 8-
             11, the constant "PHW" in positions 12-14, the EPA hazardous waste number in positions 15-18, and the
             contract line item number (CLIN) in positions 19-22. See Table 5.1 for sample Federal Stock Class
             designations. Contact Base Supply for other Federal Stock Classes and the appropriate CLIN for each waste
             generated.
        • In blocks 23 and 24, enter the unit of issue of the waste’s CLIN.
        • In blocks 25-29, enter the quantity of the waste being turned in. This will be the total quantity of the waste
             being turned in. One drum of the waste would be 00050, if two drums were turned in the quantity would be
             00100.
        • Enter the Document Number in positions 30-43; it will contain activity code "R," the organization, and shop
             code of the generating activity, the current Julian date, and the next available serial number taken from a
             locally devised off-line control register.
AFPAM 32-7043 Attachment 2 1 November 1995                                                                                 135

         •    For hazardous waste, enter "H" for the Material Condition Code in position 44.
         •    Enter the number "9" for the Action Taken Code in position 62.
         •    The words "Hazardous Waste" should be entered in Block D to readily identify the type of documentation to
              Base Supply.
5.5.4. The accumulation site manager or designee is required to take the completed AF Form 2005 to Base Supply, who
will input the data from the form into the Base Supply computer system and generate a DD Form 1348-1 disposal document
(figure 5.4). Copy 1 of AF Form 2005 will be filed in document control after processing and copy 2 will be returned to the
generating activity. The DD Form 1348-1 is the document that should accompany the waste for turn-in to the installation
hazardous waste storage facility.
5.5.5. The Base Supply representative will sign both copies (original and duplicate) of the DD Form 1348-1 in block W.
The words "Hazardous Waste" should be entered on the face of the disposal document by either the Base Supply
representative or the hazardous waste generator. The person from the generating activity should then enter the date and
time in block 13 and print and sign his or her name in blocks 14 or 15 on both books (original and duplicate) of the disposal
document.
5.5.6. Copy 1 and copy 5 of the DD Form 1348-1 disposal document will be retained by Base Supply, who will eventually
forward them to Document Control. The remaining copies will be given to the person from the generating activity, who
must hand carry the document to the Environmental Manager. The Environmental Manager will record the disposal
document number and the cost of disposal on the reverse side of an AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization, and attach a
copy of the DD Form 1348-1 to the AF Form 616. The Environmental Manager will also ensure that the hazardous waste
turned in to DRMO for disposal is weighed in the presence of an authorized DoD representative.
5.5.7. The generator should then take the remaining copies of the DD Form 1348-1 to the storage facility (with the
hazardous waste). The generator must also ensure that an up-to-date hazardous waste profile sheet is turned in with the
waste. The generator retains two copies for base records after acceptance of the waste by the operator of the storage facility.
The generator must then return one copy of the disposal document signed by the storage facility operator to the
Environmental Manager.
5.5.8. DRMO may require the generator to retain custody of the waste while DRMO administratively manages the off-site
disposal or reclamation of the waste. There may be some wastes which may not be accepted by the local DRMO. If DRMO
refuses to accept the transfer of accountability of a hazardous waste, the Environmental Manager should be immediately
notified to resolve the conflict.

5.6. On-Installation Transportation.
5.6.1. It is important to ensure that any waste transported on-installation is transported in a manner that will not endanger
the health of installation personnel or the environment. The activity that generates hazardous waste must ensure that
hazardous waste is accumulated and subsequently transported in the proper DoT-specification containers. To determine the
proper container to use, refer to the Hazardous Materials Table at 49 CFR 172.101.

 Figure 5.3. Sample AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-In Request.
136                                                                    AFPAM 32-7043 Attachment 2 1 November 1995

Figure 5.4. DD Form 1348-1 , DoD Single Line Item Release/Receipt Document (Used as Disposal Turn-in
Document)




5.6.2. The accumulation site manager should also ensure that containers are in good condition. Prior to turning in
hazardous waste, each container should be inspected by the accumulation site manager and the Environmental Manager to
ensure that it is in good condition and suitable for transportation. The container should have no leaks and no accumulation
of liquid on the top head. Also, there should be no serious corrosion, dents, sharp creases, or bulging heads. If the
container has a leak or if it is not in good condition, the waste in the drum must be transferred to a container in good
condition or the container must be overpacked in a salvage drum.
5.6.3. If the accumulation site manager or waste generator does not belong to an organization that has the authorization to
transport hazardous waste on-installation, the Transportation Squadron (5234) should be contacted to arrange for waste
pick-up and transportation. Before the vehicle leaves with the waste it should be closely inspected. If the vehicle is
carrying containers, the vehicle should be inspected to ensure that containers are securely loaded and that incompatible
wastes are not loaded next to each other. Vehicles transporting bulk wastes should be examined to ensure that all pumps,
valves, and fittings are closed tight and secured.

5.7. Record Keeping.
5.7.1. RCRA requires the maintenance of certain records on-base. The type of records, along with the retention time and a
reference to a description of each record, is presented in Table 5.2. The Environmental Manager shall maintain or know
the whereabouts of the files identified in the table and shall make them available to appropriate state and Federal inspectors
upon request.
5.7.2. The Environmental Manager will also maintain copies of hazardous waste profile sheets, DD Form 1348-1, and the
monthly M-15 reports, which are received from Base Supply and list all hazardous waste transfers to the DRMO for at least
five years after disposing of the waste streams covered by the reports. The Environmental Manager will also maintain an
updated copy of this Hazardous Waste Management Plan and accompanying hazardous waste stream inventory and waste
analysis plan.

5.8. Reporting.
AFPAM 32-7043 Attachment 2 1 November 1995                                                                            137

5.8.1. Annual Report. The State requires annual reports from hazardous waste generators and treatment, storage, and
disposal facilities by March 1 of each year covering hazardous waste activity over the previous calendar year. Each annual
report should shall include the following information:
   • Installation EPA identification number, name, and address;
   • The calendar year covered by the report;
   • The EPA identification number, name, and address of each off-site treatment, storage, and disposal company in the
       United States to which hazardous waste was shipped during the reporting year;
   • The name and EPA identification number of each transporter used during the reporting year;
   • A description, EPA hazardous waste number, DoT hazard class, and quantity of each hazardous waste shipped
       off-site to a TSDF (listed by TSDF EPA identification number);
   • A description of the efforts undertaken during the reporting year to reduce the volume and toxicity of waste
       generated;
   • A description of the changes in volume and toxicity of waste actually achieved during the reporting in comparison to
       previous years; and
   • A certification signed by the Base Commander or authorized representative.
5.8.2. Emergency Reports. Releases of hazardous waste, hazardous substances, and hazardous materials onto the land or
into the waters of the state must be immediately reported to the State Division of Environmental Management at (555)
555-5291 during business hours or via the State Highway Patrol 24-hour number (800) 555-7935 (in state) after business
hours. See the Andrews Air Force Base HAZMAT Plan for additional requirements regarding the reporting of hazardous
waste spills, releases, fires, or explosions.
5.8.3. Incident Report. In the event that the contingency portion of the HAZMAT Plan is implemented, an incident report
must be submitted within 15 days after the incident to the Department of Human Resources Hazardous Waste Branch, as
described in AAFB's HAZMAT Plan.
5.8.4. Within 60 days of the completion of final closure of the hazardous waste storage facility (Building 198), the base
must submit to the EPA Regional Administrator, by registered mail, a certification that the facility has been closed in
accordance with the specifications of the approved closure plan. The certification must be signed by the facility operator
and an independent registered professional engineer.
5.8.5. If requested by EPA or otherwise required by regulatory requirements, the installation must submit reports pursuant
to 40 CFR 264 (or 265, as appropriate) Subparts F and K through N.

                                                         TRAINING

Section A--Hazardous Waste Training Requirements.

6.1.     Personnel for Which Training is Mandatory.
6.1.1. Hazardous waste management training is required for personnel who handle hazardous waste at facilities which fit
into any of the following categories:
  • permitted hazardous waste storage facility (Building 198);
  • hazardous waste accumulation sites; or
  • emergency response organizations which may respond to hazardous waste incidents.
6.1.2. In addition to personnel identified in item a above, all AAFB personnel who perform any of the following tasks must
receive hazardous waste training:
  • decide which wastes are hazardous waste;
  • add hazardous waste into accumulation containers or tanks at accumulation sites;
  • remove hazardous waste from accumulation tanks or containers;
  • transport hazardous waste to or from accumulation sites;
  • transport hazardous waste to or from storage and treatment units;
  • respond to spills, fires, or explosions, involving hazardous waste;
  • complete hazardous waste manifests, annual reports, or exception reports;
  • inspect hazardous waste accumulation sites, storage, treatment, or disposal facilities;
  • operate accumulation sites;
  • work at permitted or interim status TSDF; or
  • conduct any tasks involving occupational exposure to or which require management of hazardous waste.

6.2. Training Frequency. The required training must be successfully completed by all of the personnel described above.
For new personnel, training must be successfully completed prior to their assignment to a positioning involving the
handling or management of hazardous waste. Until that time, untrained personnel must not perform any tasks involving
hazardous waste management unless they are supervised by trained personnel. Facility personnel identified in section 6−1
must take part in an annual review of the training program.

Section B--Training Scope.

6.3. Training Components. There are two general components to the training required by RCRA in 40 CFR 265.16.
Personnel must be trained: 1) how to perform their duties in a way that ensures AAFB compliance with hazardous waste
regulations; 2) hazardous waste management procedures, including contingency plan implementation; and 3) how to
respond to emergencies involving hazardous waste.

6.4. Air Force Hazardous Waste Management Training Program. AAFB uses the Air Force Hazardous Waste Training
Program to train applicable base personnel. The Air Force has developed a slide presentation and a computer-based
training (CBT) program to help meet Federal hazardous waste training requirements. The programs are geared to
flightline, maintenance, and other AF personnel who generate and transport hazardous waste. To fully comply with all
regulations, both programs must be tailored to meet each installation's specific requirements. AAFB's specific procedures
for waste determination, accumulation, transportation, and turn-in, must be incorporated into the training program, along
with the emergency response procedures. All hazardous waste training must include the most current Federal, State, and
local requirements. Each training course offering must be customized to fit the specific hazardous waste management
requirements of the attendees. Arrange training for similar activities at the same time. For example, present one course
offering for installation activities that generate hazardous waste as a result of painting operations (i.e., the CE paint shop,
aircraft painting operations, missile maintenance, etc.), another offering for activities that generate hazardous waste from
cleaning and degreasing operations (i.e., transportation, aircraft maintenance, etc.), and another for operators of the
hazardous waste storage facility.

6.5. Required Records. Training records are required to document that all appropriate personnel have successfully
completed their required training. The following records should be maintained by the Environmental Manager.
140                                                                    AFPAM 32-7043 Attachment 2 1 November 1995

 •    The job title for each position at the installation related to hazardous waste management and the name of the
      employee filling each job.
 •    A written job description for each position related to hazardous waste management. For the purposes of RCRA
      training records, the job description need only describe the job as it relates to the management of hazardous waste
      and must include the requisite skills, education, or other qualifications, and the duties of facility personnel assigned
      to each position.
 •    A written description of the type and amount of both introductory and continuing training that will be given to each
      person filling a position related to management of hazardous waste.
 •    Records that document that the training or job experience required to meet the training requirements have been
      provided to and completed by base personnel. These records must be kept for current employees as long as they work
      at the installation, and for an additional three years after the date they leave the base (or stop working at a position
      related to hazardous waste management). Training records may accompany personnel transferred to another
      installation.

                                           RESPONSE TO EMERGENCIES

7.1. Emergency Response Procedures and Contingency Plan Requirements. AAFB has written emergency response
procedures for hazardous waste generating activities and for the hazardous waste storage facility. The required emergency
response and contingency plan requirements have been incorporated into the AAFB Hazardous Materials Emergency
Planning and Response Plan, called the HAZMAT Plan. The HAZMAT Plan is distributed to all base activities that
generate hazardous waste. Emergency response activities relating to hazardous waste spills, fires, or explosions involving
hazardous waste shall be in accordance with the HAZMAT Plan.

7.2. Implementation. The AAFB HAZMAT Plan must be implemented whenever there is a spill, fire, explosion or release
of hazardous wastes.     All incidents involving hazardous waste or hazardous substance spills or releases must also be
immediately reported to the AAFB Fire Department at 911. All incidents off-base involving hazardous waste generated at
AAFB must be immediately reported to the local emergency reporting number, then reported to the Consolidated Command
Post at (555) 555-3121.

                                              POLLUTION PREVENTION

8.1. Pollution Prevention Program Plan. Andrews Air Force Base has prepared a Pollution Prevention Program Plan
(P3P) in order to protect and enhance the environment and reduce occupational safety and health risks to AAFB personnel
The P3P is maintained by the Environmental Manager as a stand-alone plan.

8.2. Scope of the P3P.
8.2.1. The P3P supports the concept of reducing AAFB's use of hazardous and toxic substances and the generation of
wastes through source reduction and environmentally sound recycling. According to the P3P, generation of hazardous
substances, pollutants, or contaminants will be reduced or eliminated at the source; pollution that cannot be prevented at the
source will be recycled in an environmentally safe manner; pollution that cannot be recycled will be treated in an
environmentally safe manner; and disposal or other releases to the environment will be employed only as a last resort and
will be conducted in an environmentally safe manner.
8.2.2. The P3P covers not only hazardous waste minimization, but also includes the following topics:
  • Industrial maintenance and clean-up operations involving hazardous and other wastes
  • Municipal solid waste
  • Non-point source pollution
  • Material procurement, supply, and distribution
  • Education and incentives
  • Systems acquisition
  • Allied programs associated with pollution prevention including comprehensive planning, energy and transportation
       efficiency, and natural resources value.
