           the family member may implement to obtain involuntary collection of support
           through garnishment or statutory allotments. See attached fact sheet, Attachment
           2.
           1.2.3.7.2. While proof of financial support of immediate family members
           (primary dependents; i.e., spouse, minor child, etc.) is not ordinarily required,
           upon receipt of a complaint of non-support by a family member, require proof of

           1.2.3.7.3. Working with the FSO, assess basic allowance for housing (BAH)
           entitlements. Inform members:

               not provide financial support to their spouse or children.
               1.2.3.7.3.2. Refusal to support family members will result in termination of

               Force policy.
4                                                              AFI36-2906 30 MAY 2013


    1.2.3.8. In cases alleging paternity:
       1.2.3.8.1. Counsel the member concerning the allegations, in all cases.
       1.2.3.8.2. If the member denies paternity, inform the claimant accordingly and
       advise that the Air Force does not have the authority to adjudicate paternity
       claims.
       1.2.3.8.3. If a member acknowledges paternity, advise him of his financial
       support obligations. Refer the member to the MPS, Customer Service Element,
       for guidance on eligibility of Identification Card for the child, to the local
       Financial Services Office (FSO) for with-dependent rate financial support
       information, and to the legal office for advice on the member’s legal rights and
       obligations to the child.
       1.2.3.8.4. If the case involves a member released from active duty who enters an
       Individual Reserve Program, the office of responsibility concerning personal
       financial responsibility is HQ ARPC/DS, 18420 E. Silver Creek Ave. BLDG 390
       MS 68, Buckley AFB, CO 80011. For specific guidance on eligibility of
       dependents, contact HQ ARPC/DS and for financial support information contact
       the member’s servicing Reserve Pay Office. If the case involves a member
       released from active duty who retains no military affiliation, return the case to the
       claimant advising them of the fact.
    1.2.3.9. In cases alleging personal financial indebtedness of a civil nature:
       1.2.3.9.1. Advise members of Air Force policy, including the fact that Air Force
       members are expected to pay their just financial obligations in a proper and timely
       manner. Further advise the member that the failure to pay just debts may result in
       the creditor obtaining a court judgment, which could result in an involuntary
       allotment from the member’s military pay.
       1.2.3.9.2. Advise the claimant that the Air Force has no authority to resolve
       disputed claims or to require members to pay a private debt without a civil
       judgment.
       1.2.3.9.3. If the complaint is supported by a court judgment or if the claimant is
       attempting to serve legal documents upon the Air Force, refer the claimant to the
       Defense Finance and Accounting Service (see paragraph 1.2.8) to obtain DD
       Form 2653, Involuntary Allotment Application.
       1.2.3.9.4. If the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) forwards an
       involuntary allotment application package which includes DD Form 2654,
       Involuntary Allotment Notice and Processing, (completed by the unit commander
       and member, and maintained by DFAS) and supporting documentation, the
       member's commander will ensure the procedures described on DD Form 2654 are
       followed, including the following:
           1.2.3.9.4.1. Promptly determine if the member is assigned or attached to the
           commander's unit. If not, the commander will immediately complete and
           return the DD Form 2654 to DFAS indicating that the member is not assigned
           to that unit.
AFI36-2906 30 MAY 2013                                                                     5


              1.2.3.9.4.2. If the member is assigned to the commander’s unit, but the
              member cannot respond to the action within the time designated by DFAS
              officials, the commander may grant a reasonable extension of time for the
              member to submit a response. In such cases, the commander will complete
              Section II of DD Form 2654 to reflect the new suspense date and promptly
              return a copy of the form to DFAS.
              1.2.3.9.4.3. If the member is assigned to the commander's unit and is
              available to respond to the involuntary allotment package, the commander will
              provide the member a copy of the involuntary allotment package and counsel
              the member in accordance with Section III of DD Form 2654.
              1.2.3.9.4.4. If the member does not contest the involuntary allotment, the
              member and the commander will complete Section IV of DD Form 2654 and
              return it to DFAS. If the member refuses to respond or fails to respond by the
              authorized suspense date, the commander will Note that fact in Section V of
              DD Form 2654 and return the form to DFAS. DFAS will then automatically
              process the involuntary allotment.
              1.2.3.9.4.5. If the member contests the allotment for any reason other than
              exigencies of military duty, the commander will ensure that the member
              submits a completed DD Form 2654, with supporting documentation, back to
              the commander within the time allotted (usually within 15 days of receiving
              the package from the commander). The commander will then forward the
              member’s response to DFAS for further review and final determination.
              1.2.3.9.4.6. If the member contests the allotment by asserting that exigencies
              of military duty caused the absence of the member from making an
              appearance in the judicial proceeding which forms the basis for the judgment,
              the commander will determine whether the member’s assertion is true.
               1.2.3.9.4.6.1. The term “exigencies of military duty” is defined as a military
               assignment or mission-essential duty that, because of its urgency,
               importance, duration, location, or isolation, necessitates the absence of a
               member of the Military Services from appearance at a judicial proceeding or
               prevents the member from being able to respond to a notice of application
               for an involuntary allotment. Exigency of military duty is normally
               presumed during periods of war, national emergency, or when the member
               is deployed. The commander’s decision on exigencies of military duty will
               be based upon a preponderance of the evidence.
               1.2.3.9.4.6.2. The commander’s decision on military exigencies will be
               reflected in Section V of DD Form 2654. The completed form must be
               returned to DFAS within the time allotted (usually within 90 days from the
               date DFAS mailed the DD Form 2654 to the commander, unless the
               commander granted an extension of time). The commander’s decision about
               military exigencies is binding on DFAS.
              1.2.3.9.4.7. In cases where the commander has determined that exigencies of
              military duty caused the absence of the member from the judicial proceeding,
6                                                                 AFI36-2906 30 MAY 2013


              the commander will also designate in Section V of DD Form 2654 the name
              and address of the appellate authority.
              1.2.3.9.4.8. Within the Air Force, the appellate authority is the immediate Air
              Force superior commander of the commander who made the initial decision.
              There is no appeal from the appellate authority’s decision.
    1.2.4. The Military Personnel (MPS) will:
       1.2.4.1. Assign a unit in the MPS to process complaints.

       appropriate MPS.
       1.2.4.4. Send complaints concerning member’s no longer on active duty, but who are
       assigned to an individual Reserve program to: HQ ARPC/DS, 18420 E. Silver Creek
       Ave, Bldg 390, MS 68, Buckley AFB, CO 80011. For all others refer to paragraph
       1.2.8.
       1.2.4.5. Advise the complainant that the Air Force cannot assist with individuals no
       longer under its jurisdiction such as members who have separated or retired from the
       service. Exception: If the complaint is a legal process garnishing the retiree's pay for
       child support or alimony.
       1.2.4.6. Advise claimants who want to contact a military member about indebtedness
       to request the member's military address from AFPC/DS1W (Air Force Worldwide
       Locator), 550 C Street West Suite 50, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4752. Commercial
       creditors will be charged $3.50 for locator service. HQ AFPC/DS1W will advise the
       creditor in writing if they are unable to release a member’s address.
       1.2.4.7. Recommend that AFPC/DPSIM discontinue processing when a claimant
       refuses or repeatedly fails to comply with this instruction.
       1.2.4.8. Provide creditors with the DFAS address and phone number upon request.
       1.2.4.9. Report cases of fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive business practices to the
       Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board according to Air Force Joint Instruction
       (AFJI) 31-213, Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Boards and Off-Installation
       Liaison and Operations, and AFPC/DPSIM if Air Force-wide action seems
       appropriate.
    1.2.5. The Staff Judge Advocate will:
       1.2.5.1. Advise commanders on how to apply Air Force policy to individual cases
       involving financial support of dependents, garnishments, and involuntary allotments
       for financial support based upon court orders.
          1.2.5.1.1. Advise commanders on the procedures involved in processing
          involuntary allotment cases, including assisting the commander in determining
          whether exigencies of military duty support a decision to disapprove the
          application for involuntary allotment.
          1.2.5.1.2. Advise commanders on appropriate administrative or disciplinary
AFI36-2906 30 MAY 2013                                                                      7

    FACT SHEET GARNISHMENT OF PAY AND STATUTORY ALLOTMENTS
 AGAINST MILITARY PAY FOR CHILD SUPPORT AND ALIMONY OBLIGATIONS

A2.1. Methods of Involuntary Collection of Military Pay. This fact sheet addresses the
general procedures involved in the two methods of involuntarily collecting military pay from a
military member for child support and spousal support (alimony): garnishment and statutory
allotments.
A2.2. Garnishment of Military Pay (Title 42 United States Code (USC) Section 659-662; 5
C. F.R. Part 581):
   A2.2.1. Federal law authorizes legal process (garnishment) against the pay of Air Force
   members to enforce child support and alimony in accordance with state law. Garnishments
   may be placed against the pay of active duty, Reserve, Guard and retired military members of
   the Air Force. The administrative costs incurred in establishing and maintaining an
   involuntary allotment for commercial debts, as determined by DFAS, shall be deducted from
   the amount withheld from the pay of the member. The amount deducted shall be credited to
   the appropriation, fund or account from which such administrative costs were paid.
   A2.2.2. Legal process is defined as any writ, order, summons, or other process in the nature
   of garnishment directed to the US Air Force which is issued by: a court of competent
   jurisdiction within any state, territory or possession of the US; a court of competent
   jurisdiction in any foreign country with which the US has entered into an agreement that
   requires the US to honor such process; or an authorized official pursuant to an order of such
   court of competent jurisdiction or pursuant to state or local law.
   A2.2.3. The procedure to obtain a garnishment order is determined by state law. However,
   federal law determines how the garnishment order is applied to military pay, i.e., how service
   or process is accomplished, the type of pay subject to garnishment, etc.
   A2.2.4. Unless state law specifies a lesser amount, federal law provides a limit of 50 percent
   of the member’s aggregate disposable earnings for any workweek if the member is currently
   supporting a second family (spouse or child) and 60 percent if the member is not supporting a
   second family. The percentage may be increased by 5 percent if the arrearage is 12 weeks or
   more.
   A2.2.5. The legal documents must clearly show that the garnishment order was issued for
   child support or alimony or both. Garnishment orders will not be honored for payments or
   transfers of property by one spouse to another for purposes of a marital property settlement
   or for the division of retired pay resulting from divorce or legal separation.
   A2.2.6. Sufficient identifying information must accompany the legal process in order for the
   Air Force to implement the order. At a minimum, the information must include the
   following: the member’s full name, date of birth, SSN, current military status and, if known,
   the member’s current assignment.
   A2.2.7. Enforcement of garnishment order may be accomplished by sending a request for
   involuntary allotment via certified or registered mail, return receipt requested to Garnishment
   Operations Directorate, Code L-Last 4 digits of member’s SSN, DFAS, Cleveland Center,
 10                                                                 AFI36-2906 30 MAY 2013

   5301 for additional information.
A2.3. Statutory Allotments for Child Support and Alimony (Title 42 U. S.C. Section 665,
32 C.F.R. Part 54):
   A2.3.1. Federal law authorizes allotments from active duty military pay in order to satisfy
   child support and alimony obligations. Alimony alone will not qualify under this law. These
   statutory allotments may only be paid from active duty pay.
   A2.3.2. A statutory allotment may be initiated when child support and alimony payments are
   at least 2 months in arrears. The allotment is initiated by furnishing the DFAS Center a
   written notice from a court or state agency administering the child support program under
   Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. The notice must be signed by an authorized official
   and must contain the following information:
      A2.3.2.1. A statement that the person signing the request is an agent or attorney of a state
      that has a Title IV-D plan with authority under the plan to collect money owed by a
      military member as child support or child support and alimony. The request may also be
      signed by an agent of the court issuing the order.
      A2.3.2.2. The statement must include the military member’s full name, SSN, the dates
      that the current support terminates for each child, and the exact name and address of the
      allotment payee. The statement must also show the total amount of the allotment to be
      taken and specify the amount to be paid each month for current support and the arrearage.
      A2.3.2.3. The statement must be supported by a recently certified copy of the original
      court order awarding support and a court order which specifies the amount of the arrears
      and those payments is made to liquidate such arrears.
   A2.3.3. Allotments cannot exceed 50 percent of a member’s pay and allowances if the
   member is supporting a second family. If the member is not supporting a second family, the
   allotment may not exceed 60 percent. The percentage may be increased by 5 percent if the
   arrearage is 12 weeks or more.
   A2.3.4. After DFAS receives the request, DFAS notifies the member’s commander. The
   commander will then notify and counsel the member. The member will have 30 days to cure
   the arrearage or to submit evidence that the arrearage is an error. If not, DFAS will
   ordinarily implement the allotment 30 days after the member’s notification. Payments will
   begin at the end of the month in which the allotment is to be effective.

 FACT SHEET PERSONAL INDEBTEDNESS AND INVOLUNTARY ALLOTMENTS
                        FOR CIVIL DEBTS

A3.1. Involuntary Allotments. This fact sheet addresses the general procedures involved in
resolving allegations of indebtedness and initiating involuntary allotments against military pay
for civil debts.
A3.2. Air Force Policy. Military members are expected to pay their just financial obligations in
a proper and timely manner. When necessary, commanders will council members about their
financial responsibilities. However, Air Force components have no legal authority to arbitrate or
resolve personal disputes over debts or, except as provided in paragraph A3.4, to require a
member to pay or to divert any part of a member’s pay to satisfy a private debt.
A3.3. Disputes over Indebtedness. Whenever possible, disputes over indebtedness should be
resolved through amicable means by the parties involved. Claimants desiring to contact a
military member about indebtedness may, in most cases, obtain the member's military address by
contacting the member’s department of Service (i.e., Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps)
locator service.
   A3.3.1. For Air Force members, the military locator service may be contacted at: AFPC/
   DS1W 550 C Street West, Suite 50, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4752, (210) 565-2660. The
   service will charge a reasonable fee for the research service. The Air Force does not charge
   for locator service on Air Force active duty or retired personnel. In situations where the
   Service is unable to release information about the military member (i.e., members assigned at
   overseas installations or at classified locations), the Service will forward correspondence
   from the claimant to the member at no additional cost.
A3.4. Involuntary Allotments for Civil Debts. Creditors whose bona fide efforts to collect a
debt have failed may seek relief by applying for an involuntary allotment of pay pursuant to the
Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993 (Public Law No. 103-94), as implemented by DoDI
1344.9, DoD Instruction 1344.12, and AFI 36-2906.
   A3.4.1. A creditor may initiate this process against any member of the regular Air Force, Air
   National Guard or Air Force Reserve. Involuntary allotments will not be taken from retired
   or disability pay. The application is initiated by submitting a DD Form 2653, supported by a
   certified copy of a judgment issued by a civil court and any other certifications required by
   the DoDI, to the appropriate DoD agency. The DD Form 2653 may be obtained from DFAS.
   A3.4.2. The creditor's application must certify certain state and federal procedural
   requirements have been satisfied prior to obtaining the judgment, including satisfaction of the
   procedural requirements of the ”Servicemembers Civil Relief Act” of 2003.
   A3.4.3. Upon proper receipt of a complete application package, DFAS will forward a copy
   of the application to the member and the member's commander along with a DD Form 2654,
   Involuntary Allotment Notice and Processing. The member will have 90 days from the
   date DFAS mails the package in which to respond to the application. The member's time to
   respond to the action may be extended by the member's commander for good cause. If the
   member and commander fail to respond to the notice from DFAS within the allotted time,
12                                                                 AFI36-2906 30 MAY 2013


  and application is otherwise valid, DFAS may automatically process the involuntary
  allotment on the 15th calendar day after the date a response was due.
  A3.4.4. If the member consents to the allotment, the commander will return the package to
  DFAS. The allotment will commence within 30 days. If the member contests the
  application, the member may seek legal assistance and will submit supporting evidence
  refuting the validity of the application within 15 days to his or her commander, who will then
  forward the response to DFAS.
  A3.4.5. DFAS officials will make the final decision on any issues or defenses raised by the
  member except for the issue of whether "military exigencies" adversely impacted the
  member. A "military exigency" is defined in DoDI 1344.09, to be a military assignment or
  mission-essential duty that, because of its urgency, importance, duration, location or
  isolation, necessitates the member to be absent from an appearance at a judicial proceeding,
  or prevents the member from being able to respond to notice of an involuntary allotment
  action. Exigency of military duty is normally presumed during periods of war, national
  emergency, or when the member is deployed. The member’s unit commander will decide
  whether the defense of military exigencies is valid and the commander’s decision on this
  issue is binding on DFAS. Commanders return the application to DFAS indicating their
  decision on the DD Form 2654. If the commander finds that the military exigencies defense
  is valid, DFAS will return the application to the creditor without further action.
  A3.4.6. If the involuntary allotment application is denied based upon the commander’s
  determination that military exigencies adversely impacted the member’s ability to respond to
  the legal action, DFAS will give the creditor the name and address of the appellate authority
  listed on the DD Form 2654 by the commander. In the Air Force, the appellate authority is
  the immediate Air Force superior commander to the commander who made the initial
  decision. The creditor may appeal the denial to the appellate authority, who will make the
  final decision within 30 days of receiving the appeal and who will respond directly to the
  creditor. The appellate authority’s decision may not be appealed. If the appeal is granted,
  the creditor must submit a written request to DFAS, along with a copy of the appellate
  authority’s decision, to start the allotment.
  A3.4.7. Involuntary allotments will be taken only from pay that is "subject to involuntary
  allotment," as defined by DoDI 1344.12. Pay subject to allotment includes basic pay and
  certain other payments, but not allowances, reimbursements for expenses, or separation pay.
  The maximum amount of pay that may be taken is the lesser of 25 percent of the member’s
  pay subject to involuntary allotment or the maximum amount authorized by the applicable
  state’s law. Other debts (e.g., income tax withholding, government debts, military fines and
  forfeitures, family support obligations) take priority over allotments for civil debts.
  A3.4.8. DFAS is the designated agency to receive involuntary allotment applications on Air
  Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps personnel. For further information contact DFAS at
  the following address: Garnishment Operations Directorate, Code L-Last 4 digits of
  member’s SSN, DFAS, Cleveland Center, P.O. Box 998002, Cleveland, OH 44199-8002 or
  call (216) 522-5301 or DSN 580-5301.
