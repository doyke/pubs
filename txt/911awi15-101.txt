       PITTSBURGH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT LIGHTNING WARNING SYSTEM

A1.1. General introduction:
   A1.1.1. The Precision Lightning Warning System (PLWS) installed at the Pittsburgh international air-
   port receives data from two sources:
       A1.1.1.1. Electric Field Mills (EFMs).
       A1.1.1.2. Real-time lightning data obtained from the National Lightning Detection Network.

A1.2. The two EFMs at Pittsburgh are located on the Grant-Oliver Building at the exit from the public
parking lots at the airport and on the 14-32 electrical field Vault. These EFMs identify potentially danger-
ous lightning conditions and initiate appropriate safety procedures EFMS DO NOT PREDICT IF LIGHT-
NING WILL OCCUR. EFM merely indicates that conditions are unsafe as measured by the safety
criteria.

A1.3. Warning Levels:
   A1.3.1. Using the two sources of information above, multiple levels of warning are generated by the
   PLWS, system users are altered either by a Yellow/Red indicator light, or a text message over the
   Com-net system.
   A1.3.2. Thresholds:
       A1.3.2.1. Whenever a lightning flash occurs at a distance equal to or within 17.0 miles, but not
       within 5.5 miles and one EFM has equaled or exceeded its threshold.
       A1.3.2.2. The potential level of two EFMs has equaled or exceeded the established threshold with
       no lightning flash occurring within 17.0 miles.
       A1.3.2.3. A lightning flash occurs at a distance equal to or within 5.5 miles but not within 3.0
       miles with any EFM reporting a value equal to or greater than the established threshold.
   A1.3.3. Lightning Warning.
       A1.3.3.1. Color Sequence: Red.
       A1.3.3.2. Con-net Indication: LIGHTNING WARNING LEVEL HIGH. Sent as information an
       ALARM.
   A1.3.4. Thresholds:
       A1.3.4.1. Whenever a lightning flash occurs at a distance equal to or less than 5.5 miles.
       A1.3.4.2. A lightning flash occurs at distance equal to or within 5.5 miles, but no within 3.0 miles
       and both EFM threshold alarms have been activated.
       A1.3.4.3. This level will remain for at least five (5) minutes after the initial warning.
   A1.3.5. Comments:
6                                                                          911AWI15-101 13 APRIL 2007
