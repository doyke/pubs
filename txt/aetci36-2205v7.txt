1.1. Introduction. HQ AETC conducts graduate level flying training courses to provide
qualified aircrew to the mobility air forces (MAF) and to sustain formal training unit (FTU)
operations. These training courses produce aircrew with basic, mission, or instructor
qualification applicable to each aircraft and mission. Each flying training course syllabus
outlines graduation status, training location, course entry prerequisites, and provides a summary
of training.     The Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) Website,
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/ also provides student administration and processing information.
1.2. Specific Use.
   1.2.1. Applies to all airlift and tanker graduate level students, officer and career enlisted
   aviators (CEA).

        1.3.7.18. Issue the AF Form 1256, Certificate of Training, upon graduation from the
        formal training course and completion of the out-processing checklist.
1.4. Training Syllabus. The syllabus is the command-approved directive for executing each
programmed flying training (PFT) formal training course. It takes precedence over local
instructions and supplements. If no clear syllabus guidance exists, resolve the conflict using the
appropriate chain of command. Only the OPR may interpret syllabus guidance. If the logical
course of action conflicts with other directives, call the OPR listed in the syllabus. AETC syllabi
are not valid until signed by HQ AETC/A2/3/10 and will not be implemented until a signature is
obtained. Note: If a conflict exists between the syllabus and a supporting ATS contract, the
original AETC approved syllabus in place at that time will continue to be executed until the
conflict is resolved by AETC, AMC, and AFMC.
     1.4.1. Course Durations. The syllabus lists the formal course duration.
AETCI362205V7 5 APRIL 2011                                                                     9


   1.4.2. Sortie and Hour Requirements. Each syllabus has a programmed number of sorties,
   flying hours and additional sortie authorizations. Unless otherwise specified in the syllabus,
   additional sorties required beyond the course limit must have 19 AF/DO approval. (For ANG
   students, NGB/A3 is the approval authority. HQ AFRC/A3T is approval authority for AFRC
   students.) Proficiency advancement is defined in paragraph 3.8. It will not be used as a
   management tool to graduate students by a specific date.
   1.4.3. Academics. Units who maintain student written examinations will secure all tests and
   document the removal, replacement, and destruction of all examinations.
1.5. Equipment Required. See ETCA (https://etca.randolph.af.mil). Follow procedures in
AFMAN 23110, Volume 2, USAF Supply Manual, Part 2, Chapter 23, paragraph 23.34, to
ensure required training equipment (for example, uniforms and gear) is provided for personnel
selected for aircrew training. The appropriate AFRC or ANG unit will issue flying clothing,
equipment, and special requirement items for ANG and AFRC students (whether or not they are
in the Air Force Training Management System) before the individual arrives for training. Direct
further questions regarding clothing, equipment, and special requirements to the school registrar
(see specific course detail found in the individual course description section for contact
information). Note: It is the responsibility of the losing base to provide required training
equipment (i.e., flying clothing, equipment and gear) to personnel selected for aircrew training.
The FTU will only issue those items peculiar to the formal training school.
1.6. End-of-Course Critiques. Each unit administers an end-of-course critique program as an
integral part of the formal training course. Supervisors review reports and initiate corrective
action as necessary. Critiques will be administered within 15 duty days of graduation. Units will
submit a summary of the EOC critiques to the AETC Program Managers/SMEs for review at
least quarterly.
1.7. Aircrew Graduate Evaluation Program (AGEP). Aircrew members who have
completed training through an AETC formal undergraduate or graduate flying training program
will be evaluated on the effectiveness of their previous training according to AETCI 362206,
Aircrew Graduate Evaluation Program. Refer to AETCI 362206 for specific program guidance.
Direct feedback survey questions and comments to HQ AETC/A3ZM (DSN 4872014) for
questions concerning the AGEP Web site access, contact HQ AETC/A3IE (DSN 4872045).
1.8. Production Metrics Report. HQ AETC/A3RB, assisted by the 19 AF staff, is the primary
POC for flying training production metrics. At the beginning of each fiscal year, HQ
AETC/A3RB uploads the programmed flying training (PFT) document to the flying training
production analysis (FTPA) Web-based input tool. Group commanders or their designated POCs
will update FTPA with actual entries, gains, losses, eliminations, graduation numbers, and notes,
if needed, to explain wash backs, eliminations, or date changes to a class. Updates are due 5
calendar days after the class start date and class graduation date.

                              STUDENT ADMINISTRATION

2.1. Inprocessing. Units will review incoming student records to verify they are complete and
to determine initial supervision required before any other than ―academic‖ only training courses.
Students must meet course entry prerequisites established by the syllabus, AFI 11-202, Volume 1
and AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 1. They must also comply with reporting instructions in the ETCA.
At a minimum, units will review these records (or equivalents):
   2.1.1. Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF). Students will hand carry FEFs, if applicable, to
   training according to ETCA guidance. Depending on AFSC, some individuals may not yet
   possess an FEF.
   2.1.2. Individual Flight Records. Students will hand carry flight records, if applicable, to
   training according to ETCA guidance. Depending on AFSC, some individuals may not yet
   possess individual flight records.
   2.1.3. Training records from previous courses. Note: Enlisted Center of Excellence (CoE)
   students will hand carry sealed training records to their follow-on training locations.
2.2. Waivers:
   2.2.1. Prerequisite Waivers. Losing or home unit commanders will ensure students meet
   course entry prerequisites. The losing/home units will initiate prerequisite entry waivers and
   coordinate with the training location OG/CC. Complete AETC Form 6 for waiver requests.
   Exception: When an Air Force instruction prescribes formal course entry prerequisites, use it
   to determine waiver authority.
   2.2.2. Syllabus Waivers. An approved syllabus waiver is required for any planned exception
   to AETC syllabuses caused by special or unusual circumstances, for individual students.
   Permanent or blanket waivers are not authorized, but should be suggested as individual
   syllabus changes through HQ AETC/A3ZM.                 Submit individual waiver requests
   electronically or in writing on an AETC Form 6. Do not change the order of, omit, or
   accomplish any training requested in a waiver until notified of approval.
   2.2.3. Approval Authorities. Submit waivers to these approval authorities, except when other
   governing directives instruct otherwise:
       2.2.3.1. Syllabus waivers and syllabus prerequisite waivers: 19 AF/DO.
       2.2.3.2. Senior officer syllabus and entry prerequisite waivers: 19 AF/CC.
   2.2.4. Waiver approval authorities will forward a copy of all disapproved and approved
   waivers to HQ AETC/A3ZM.
   2.2.5. Maintain a permanent record of all approved waivers in the student’s training record.
2.3. Syllabus Variations:
   2.3.1. Syllabus Deviation. A syllabus deviation is any unplanned variation from such
   syllabus requirements as prerequisite flow, turn times, landing currency, or maneuver item
   file (MIF) requirements. Document all syllabus deviations in the student’s training record.
   Note: All syllabus-directed training will be accomplished unless a waiver request is
AETCI362205V7 5 APRIL 2011                                                                      11


   approved. If unforeseen circumstances result in an omission of required training, the ATS
   Site Manager or the OG/CC will determine if the omitted training can be accomplished later
   in the syllabus flow without adversely affecting the quality of student training. Place
   documentation in the student’s training record to show ATS Site Manager or OG/CC directed
   corrective actions and the accomplishment of the omitted training. Exception: Non-U.S.
   crewmembers will not complete tasks/events or lessons/sorties restricted to U.S. unless prior
   written approval was obtained from HQ AETC/IA.
   2.3.2. Incomplete Training. Annotate training requirements in the student’s training record
   that cannot be accomplished because of prolonged shortfalls or limitations. In situations
   where course training standards (CTS) requirements are not achieved because of prolonged
   shortfalls or limitations, standardization/evaluation will also annotate the deficiency on AF
   IMT 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training, AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew
   Certifications or AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, as appropriate, for
   inclusion in the student’s FEF. (AF IMT 1381 is prescribed in AFI 11401, Flight
   Management, and AF Forms 4348 and 8 are prescribed in AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew
   Standardization/Evaluation Program. Refer to those publications for guidance completing the
   forms.)
   2.3.3. Disenrollment. Process all students who fail to progress according to AFI 11-
   402/AETC SUP.
   2.3.4. Other Than FTU Course Completion. Students will complete all syllabus training in
   order to graduate from an AETC course and depart the training unit. Students may not make
   up training at the follow-on unit without an approved syllabus waiver, unless specifically
   noted in the syllabus.
2.4. Notification Procedures:
   2.4.1. Students Experiencing Difficulty. When a student is entered into the Progress Review
   (PR) process, fails a flight evaluation, or is withdrawn from training, units will notify:
      2.4.1.1. Active Duty Students. Notify 19 AF/DOH and the student’s home or gaining
      unit.
      2.4.1.2. ANG Students. Notify the student’s home unit, 19 AF/CCG, and NGB/A3O.
      2.4.1.3. AFRC Students. Notify the student’s home unit, 19 AF/CCR, and HQ
      AFRC/A3T.
      2.4.1.4. International Students. Notify international student’s International Military
      Student Officer (IMSO).
   2.4.2. Graduation Date Update. OG/CC will notify 19 AF/DOH and NGB/A1FF or HQ
   AFRC/A1MG, as appropriate, and the gaining unit when any student is more than 15 training
   days behind or if it becomes apparent that a student will not graduate within 30 training days
   of their scheduled PFT graduation date. Provide reason(s) and an estimated graduation date.
   If the graduation date is changed (i.e. the student is rolled back to a later class), notify the
   student’s gaining unit, 19 AF/DO, HQ AETC/A3Z, HQ AETC/A3R and NGB/A1FF or
   AFRC/A1MB (as appropriate) not later than 5 duty days after discovery. The OG/CC will
   coordinate any required follow up action, such as assignment changes, follow-on training,
   port calls, amendments to orders, extended TDY waivers, etc. If a student will be extended
 12                                                             AETCI362205V7 5 APRIL 2011


   beyond their report no later than date (RNLTD), contact AFPC for procedures. 19 AF/CC
   and HQ AETC/A3R approval is required to roll back an entire class.
       2.4.2.1. TDY-to-school-funded students (not applicable to students in permanent change
       of station [PCS] status). The assigned training unit will notify HQ AETC/FMAMA of
       any student training delays over 7 calendar days that are because of wash backs, break-in-
       training (BIT), duty not including flying (DNIF), administrative hold, disciplinary action,
       or elimination.
       2.4.2.2. Orders will be amended for all delays over 7 calendar days. Commanders will
       work with HQ AETC/A1F to determine the disposition of these students.
2.5. Fitness Standards. Students in AETC FTUs will participate in scheduled physical training
according to AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program. Student physical training regimens may be designed
into each syllabus. If not specifically described in the syllabus, students attend physical training
with their assigned squadron when such training does not interfere with formal training
academics or scheduled lessons or sorties.
2.6. Student Scheduling. Do not schedule students to perform duties in excess of a 12-hour
flight duty period unless prescribed by the applicable AFI 11-2MDS-specific Volume 3, or AFI
11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules. Academic schedulers will follow guidelines in AETCI
36-2205, Volume 1.
2.7. Training Requirements and Restrictions. Minimum hour requirements, if applicable, are
specified in individual course syllabi.
2.8. Distinguished Graduate (DG):
   2.8.1. Units with a DG program will recognize students who clearly excel during formal
   training. Formalize DG program in local supplements. DGs must demonstrate outstanding
   progress in each block/phase of academic, simulator, and flying training and outstanding
   results in flying and simulator evaluations. The unit commander is the final approval
   authority for all awards.
   2.8.2. Units will develop their own method of identifying the top 10 percent of students per
   class as DGs; classes with fewer than 10 students may have 1 DG. Fractions may be rounded
   upward. Commanders may elect not to designate a DG in a class.
   2.8.3. DGs will receive an AETC Form 499, Distinguished Graduate Certificate, or an
   approved local substitute, signed by the SQ/CC and DO.
   2.8.4. Students in the grade of E-8, E-9 or O-5 and above are ineligible for the DG program.

                                TRAINING MANAGEMENT

3.1. Training records.
   3.1.1. Each student will have a training record that includes grade sheets and other
   documentation as defined by the specific syllabus, applicable AFI 11-2MDS-specific
   volumes, and local guidance. Units may use, in whole or in part, electronic media (such as
   the Graduate Training Information Management System [GTIMS] or Training Integration
   Management System [TIMS]) to fulfill this requirement.
   3.1.2. Student training records are for the exclusive use of the student’s instructors, FLT/CC,
   supervisors, and immediate chain of command. Additional procedures may be specified in
   unit supplements to this instruction.
      3.1.2.1. Secure training records (both paper and electronic) and student personnel
      information folders (SPIF) to prevent unauthorized access. Information affecting student
      training that is inappropriate for public access or sensitive in nature is documented in the
      SPIF. The contractor approved for conducting formal training or maintaining training
      records may keep training records in a secure location. When required, FLT/CCs and
      supervisors will maintain SPIFs on students to protect information of a personal nature
      not appropriate for the training folder. Students may access only their own training
      record.
          3.1.2.1.1. SPIF. Documents or training records not associated with, or directly
          relevant to, formal course aircrew training and that are inappropriate for public access
          or sensitive will be maintained separately from the aircrew training record in a SPIF.
          The SPIF is protected according to the Privacy Act of 1974 and maintained in a
          secure location apart from aircrew training record documents. The SPIF, if required,
          is maintained by the squadron and disposed of according to Air Force RDS. If
          pertinent to follow-on location, the SPIF will be securely forwarded to next duty
          location.
      3.1.2.2. Record each aircraft, academic, and ground training lesson in the training record.
   3.1.3. The units training system dictates which forms are used in each training record. If
   electronic training records are not used, the following items will be included in the training
   record and annotated according to 11-2MDS, Volume 1, as applicable:
      3.1.3.1. Training record Discrepancy Log/Record of Training record Review (locally
      produced).
      3.1.3.2. AF IMT 4022, Aircrew Training Folder.
      3.1.3.3. AF IMT 4023, Aircrew Training Progress Report.

      3.1.3.8. Additional forms required for weapons qualification or other requirements
      determined locally (for example, clearance logs, CTS requirement logs, etc.).
      3.1.3.9. AETC Form 6, Waiver Request.
      3.1.3.10. AETC Form 101, Student Performance Summary. If applicable, units prepare
      this form to record and monitor student deficiencies during the course of training. Keep
      the form in the student’s training folder. Documented military deficiencies (including
      unexcused tardiness or absences, traffic tickets, unaccompanied quarters inspection
      failures, fitness program, and dress and appearance violations per AFI 362903, Dress and
      Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel) will be specified.
   3.1.4. Documentation. Grade sheets are used to document student training in the training
   record. Instructors provide grades for applicable mission events/tasks, give a concise
   summary of the student’s training, and ensure entries clarify any training action. In addition,
   documentation on grade sheets is required for the following:
      3.1.4.1. Airsickness or MOA episodes.
      3.1.4.2. Unusual occurrences that could affect the student’s progress.
      3.1.4.3. Syllabus deviations.
      3.1.4.4. Authorization for and accomplishment of AT.
      3.1.4.5. Training record review prior to an EC.         Document any training anomalies,
      deviations, etc.
      3.1.4.6. Removal from or reinstatement into training.
      3.1.4.7. Syllabus prerequisite waivers or syllabus waivers.
      3.1.4.8. Failure of any academic test, flight evaluation or EC.
      3.1.4.9. Counseling sessions.
      3.1.4.10. Administrative hold.
      3.1.4.11. Assignment to and removal from CAP.
3.2. Grading Procedures (units not utilizing the Graduate Training Information
Management System (GTIMS).
   3.2.1. Performance and Knowledge Standards. Measure student performance and knowledge
   against the CTS and the required proficiency level (RPL). These standards and proficiency
   levels are drawn from the Master Task Listing (MTL) and AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 2. The
   RPL is the minimum level the student must accomplish as per the MIF. A performance code
   value (Table 3.1) will have a knowledge code (Table 3.2) associated for each specific
   task/event or sortie/lesson (for example, 2B or 3C). Knowledge codes can be used alone to
   define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task/event (for
   example, B or C), or for a subject common to several tasks/events.

                                             activities.
      3.2.2. Individual Task/Event Grading. The instructor evaluates the student’s training and
      performance before proceeding to the next lesson/sortie. The instructor measures student
      performance on all subordinate objectives in the lesson/sortie. MIF items not accomplished
      during the lesson/sortie may be evaluated verbally. Each task/event will be graded using the
      grading scale in Table 3.3 unless otherwise specified in the syllabus.

Notes:
1. Students with a rating of ―S‖ or ―U‖ in an area requiring a ―P‖ will receive remedial training
during this and (or) subsequent tasks/events until reaching a rating of ―P‖.
2. Any task/event graded ―U‖ will have an associated remark in the student’s training record.
3. Follow AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 1, for guidance in completing training records.
    3.2.3. Overall Lesson/Sortie Grade. After grading individual tasks/events, the instructor will
    rate the student’s overall performance. The overall grading scale is shown in Table 3.4 and
    should be followed unless otherwise specified in the syllabus.

5        NG                 No Grade              Non-graded lesson or sortie
Notes:
1. The overall lesson/sortie grade is at the discretion of the instructor ―G‖ or ―E‖ may be
appropriate when an individual grade of ―U‖ is given for a single noncritical task/event. A
student’s performance is expected to improve during training, and lack of progression will be
reflected in the overall grade.
2. Following an overall lesson/sortie grade of ―U‖, students will not progress to or perform a
lesson/sortie in another block/phase of training until the objectives of that lesson/sortie are
satisfactorily achieved.
3. Follow AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 1, for guidance in completing the training record.
3.3. Units Employing GTIMS Grading Procedures.
      3.3.1. Table 3.5 prescribes the performance standards for assigning grades to specific
      training task(s). Instructors assign grades on the student’s characteristic performance without
      regard to the student’s type and amount of training. These standards are drawn from the
      MTL and AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 2. The RPL is the minimum level the student must
      accomplish as per the MIF.
AETCI362205V7 5 APRIL 2011                                                                         19

9   R ( See Note)
                     proficiency was maintained.
Note: I and R grading scales should be kept to a minimum and are intended for simulator and
system refresher courses.
    3.3.2. Overall Grading. Table 3.6 describes the overall lesson grades. The overall grade
    represents the instructor’s subjective assessment of the student’s cumulative sortie/lesson
    performance measured against the task/event performance standards for each training sortie.
    MIF items not accomplished during the lesson/sortie may be evaluated verbally. Students are
    expected to progress as they advance in training. A student’s continued lack of progress
    20                                                          AETCI362205V7 5 APRIL 2011


      should be reflected with an overall sortie performance grade. The syllabus-defined required
      proficiency level (RPL) must be met for sortie/lesson progression.

                                  objectives.
                                  A sortie/lesson is effective/incomplete if the student does not
                                  accomplish all sortie/lesson training tasks and additional
2   Effective/Incomplete          sorties remain available in the mission/phase to accomplish
                                  the missed training tasks. Example: Early termination of the
                                  sortie due to weather or maintenance.
                                  Sortie/lesson is effective/regression if the student

                                  preprinted RPL.
                                  Sortie/lesson is NE/SNP if the student fails to clear regression
    Non effective (NE)/Student    status, does not achieve required training task CTS on the last
4
    Non- progression (SNP)        sortie/lesson in a phase, or is graded ―D‖ for any training
                                  task.
                                  Sortie/lesson is NE/Other if the student does not accomplish
                                  required training tasks due to external factors. Example:
5   NE/Other
                                  failure to launch due to maintenance or weather. The
                                  sortie/lesson is rescheduled.
3.4. CTS:
    3.4.1. Purpose. The purpose of CTS is to provide individual task/event standards to meet
    lead command’s graduate requirements.
    3.4.2. General Proficiency Standards:
       3.4.2.1. CTS equate to a proficiency maneuver grade of ―P‖ for task/event performance
       or ―P‖ for task/event knowledge unless otherwise stated, ―3‖ for GTIMS grading. The
       student will attain this standard not later than completion of the sortie prior to the
       evaluation (flight or simulator).
            3.4.2.1.1. Procedural knowledge and application will comply with applicable and
            current directives to allow safe and efficient mission accomplishment.
            3.4.2.1.2. Momentary deviations are acceptable if timely corrections are made and
            safety of flight is not compromised.
 22                                                            AETCI362205V7 5 APRIL 2011


           3.4.2.1.3. The CTS listed in the syllabi MIF tables correspond to the grading criteria
           areas in the AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 2, except those unique to each course and
           designated by a higher series number than those associated with the Volume 2 areas
           or subareas (for example, 100 series CTS). The source regulation takes precedence if
           a variance occurs between the CTS and the source regulation (AFI 11-2MDS,
           Volume 2).
           3.4.2.1.4. Employment. The MIF identifies student progression necessary for
           successful course completion. Prior to course completion, each student must pass an
           AFI 11-202, Volume 2, evaluation which fulfills AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 2,
           qualification requirements.
3.5. MIF. Students will be graded on all items listed in the formal course syllabus MIF table
unless exceptions are noted in the training record. The RPL a student must attain per each MIF
follows:
   3.5.1. ATD MIF. Attain an RPL of ―P‖ or ―3‖ (for GTIMS) prior to last profile unless
   otherwise noted.
   3.5.2. Aircraft MIF. Attain an RPL of ―P‖ or ―3‖ (for GTIMS) on all items by the flight prior
   to the evaluation sortie unless otherwise noted.
3.6. Duties and Responsibilities:
   3.6.1. Student Responsibilities. Students will accomplish all assigned training.
   3.6.2. Instructor Responsibilities. Instructors are ultimately responsible for accomplishing all
   preflight, postflight, and training requirements.
3.7. Regression Rules. Once a student achieves a grade of ―P‖ or ―3‖ for a task/event, the only
grades allowed are either a ―P‖ or ―3‖ / ―U‖ or ―0‖. Regression occurs when a maneuver is
graded ―U‖ or ―0‖ after having achieved ―P‖ or ―3‖ in the same task/event. Regression requires
an explanation in the student’s training record. However, the overall grade is based on the
instructor’s discretion. For regression, the student will re-obtain proficiency prior to the end of
the block/phase of training in order to be recommended for evaluation (when applicable).
Document the remedial instruction, clearing the regression, in the student’s training record.
3.8. Proficiency Advancement (PA). The ATS Site Manager, SQ/DO or FLT/CC is the
approval authority for student PA. Students may advance past a single sortie/lesson to the next
sortie/lesson or evaluation in a training category provided all RPLs are met or exceeded for the
advanced (skipped) sortie/lesson. Note: PA may be utilized more than once in a phase, as
applicable. Note: Minimum events may not be reduced for a lesson/phase with a PA grade.
3.9. Break-in-Training (BIT). The ATS Site Manager or SQ/DO may authorize an AT sortie
due to extended training delays. As a guide, consider 7 calendar days, but no more than 14 days
without an aircraft or ATD sortie as an extended break. Use this authority only when the
remaining syllabus sorties are insufficient to compensate for the BIT. All AT will be
documented in the student’s training record. AT sorties will be limited to those required for the
student to regain the proficiency level attained prior to the BIT. BIT sorties will be graded no-
grade (NG) overall unless safety of flight is a factor upon which an unsatisfactory (U) is then
warranted.
AETCI362205V7 5 APRIL 2011                                                                      23


3.10. Additional Training (AT). Total allowable AT will be set at 15 percent or 2 (whichever
is greater) above syllabus directed training requirements and will be calculated for both ground
based training devices (ATDs) and for flight training. Note: Areas that calculate to a whole
number and a decimal will be rounded to the next higher number (e.g., 1.4 would be set at a
maximum of two (2)). ATD and training sortie AT maximums will be accounted for separately.
Calculated AT totals will be documented in each AETC syllabus. AT events should be allocated
evenly between the SQ/CC and OG/CC. Once a student has exceeded the number of training
flights and/or additional training sorties allowed by the syllabus (with the exceptions noted in
Paragraph 4.2.3.), commanders may consider eliminating the student according to AFI 11-402.
3.11. Disposition of Student Training Records. Unit registrars maintain student-training
records according to the Air Force RDS. Include all grade sheets, student activity records, and
all additional training record forms and logs. Units will forward all records to the student’s
gaining unit or follow-on training unit (as applicable) within 15 duty days of class graduation. In
the event student records are maintained electronically and the gaining unit does not have access
to the electronic system, units will forward a hard-copy version of all records.

   4.1.1. Objective. To focus supervisory attention on a student’s training progress, specific
   deficiencies, and potential to complete the program. CAP may also be used to monitor
   personal issues requiring supervisory attention. CAP is intended as a short-term program. A
   student requiring an extended period of increased supervision or repeated placement on CAP
   based on performance should be considered for an elimination check (EC). Note: CAP does
   not apply to courses of 7 training days or less.
   4.1.2. Squadron Commander (SQ/CC) Responsibilities. The SQ/CC administers CAP.
   During contractor provided training, the TRS/CC administers the program. Once a student
   begins flight line training, the flying SQ/CC administers the program. Note: CAP
   administration may be delegated to the SQ/DO, flight commander (FLT/CC), or designated
   supervisor, but the SQ/CC maintains overall authority and responsibility.
   4.1.3. Categories. Units will place students into one or more of the following categories:
      4.1.3.1. Flying. Students demonstrating flying deficiencies in the aircraft.
      4.1.3.2. Procedural. Students exhibiting substandard general or emergency procedure
      knowledge.
      4.1.3.3. Academic. Students exhibiting substandard academic performance.
      4.1.3.4. Military. Students exhibiting substandard military or professional behavior.
      4.1.3.5. Other. Students with personal issues requiring supervisory attention.
   4.1.4. CAP Procedures:
      4.1.4.1. Placement. The FLT/CC, SQ/DO, SQ/CC, ATS Site Manager, or designated
      supervisor places a student on CAP when substandard performance, personal issues, or
      lost training requires close monitoring of individual progress. The initiating individual
      will counsel students placed on CAP. Initial counseling will address the reason for CAP
      placement, CAP objectives, student training plan, instructor continuity, and CAP removal
      goals.
      4.1.4.2. CAP Student Activities. While students are in CAP the unit will:
          4.1.4.2.1. Tailor training to address the student’s particular situation within the limits
          of the syllabus.
          4.1.4.2.2. Closely monitor instructor continuity.
          4.1.4.2.3. Not compromise proficiency standards to permit CAP students to progress
          in training. Provide additional sorties to clear flight deficiencies not to exceed those
          authorized by the PR process and/or the syllabus.
          4.1.4.2.4. Provide additional counseling as required. Additional counseling is done at
          the discretion of immediate supervisors but is required if students fail to meet the
          CAP removal goals.
AETCI362205V7 5 APRIL 2011                                                                      25


           4.1.4.2.5. Appropriately update any intermediate goals and CAP removal goals.
           4.1.4.2.6. Regularly brief squadron leaders on a student’s progress toward CAP
           removal. This briefing should include student strong and weak areas and CAP
           removal criteria.
       4.1.4.3. Maintain documentation of all counseling in the student’s training record. Note:
       Document sessions concerning sensitive personal problems on AF IMT 174, Record of
       Individual, Counseling or AETC Form 173 and retain in a separate student personal
       information folder (SPIF) maintained by the supervisor. See Paragraph 3.1.2.1.
       4.1.4.4. CAP Removal. The same unit SQ/CC who approved placing a student on CAP
       will approve removal from CAP when the student meets CAP removal goals,
       demonstrates sustained normal progress, or resolves personal issues. This authority will
       not be delegated. Removal should not be strictly event/task/sortie/lesson based,
       particularly when individual weak areas can carry over into the next phase or module.
       Immediate supervisors will counsel students when they are removed from CAP.
4.2. Progress Review Process (PR). When a student demonstrates significant substandard
performance, conduct a PR to evaluate factors affecting the student’s performance and potential
to complete training. Students will continue in training until their ability to complete the course
comes into question. PRs will include a review of the student’s training record; an interview
with the student and interviews with instructors, military training leaders, and supervisors (when
appropriate). Document all PRs in the student’s training record, or the electronic media
equivalent. Consider placement on CAP.
   4.2.1. Level One (L1). The FLT/CC, Superintendent, or aircrew training system (ATS) lead
   instructor will review the student’s training for these reasons: Exam failure; first aircraft
   sortie or ATD failure; repeat aircraft sorties or ATDs graded Conditionally/Subpar; failure to
   attain RPL for ground training. Note: Exams include phase/block tests, end-of-course tests,
   and required flight evaluation requisite exams. The FLT/CC, Superintendent, or ATS lead
   instructor may; continue student in training; authorize one ATD; authorize additional ground
   training; direct a level two (L2) review to recommend additional sorties, more than one ATD,
   or to recommend elimination.
   4.2.2. L2 Review. The student’s squadron commander (SQ/CC) will review the student’s
   training after the second or repeat exam failure; second or repeat aircraft sortie or ATD
   failure; recurring failure to attain ground training RPL; or an AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Flying
   Operations, evaluation failure. Note: During contractor provided training, the TRS/CC or
   ATS Site Manager conducts the review. Once a student begins flight line training, the flying
   SQ/CC conducts the review (if conducted by TRS/CC the ATS Site Manager should provide
   relevant information). The commander may; 1) authorize additional sorties according to the
   syllabus (additional ATD training is at the discretion of the ATS Site Manager with the
   concurrence of the SQ/CC); authorize additional ground training; direct an EC; initiate the
   commander’s review (CR) process; or direct a level three (L3) review if more sorties are
   required. Note: Syllabus additional training sortie/ATD limits will be calculated in
   accordance with paragraph 3.10.
 26                                                            AETCI362205V7 5 APRIL 2011


   4.2.3. L3 Review. The Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) will review the students
   training record when the SQ/CC recommends additional sorties or when the student exceeds
   the maximum number of sorties or hours allowed in the syllabus. The intent is to raise the
   level of review when excessive assets are expended to meet training goals, regardless of the
   cause. Exception: The extra sorties do not include sorties/ATD flown for support or to
   regain proficiency lost during BIT, EC, or incomplete sorties. The OG/CC may; authorize
   additional sorties according to the syllabus; deny additional sorties; or request a 19 AF/DO
   waiver for additional sorties above those outlined in the syllabus. Note: The OG/CC may
   reinstate student a second time with 19 AF/DO waiver approval for additional sorties. If the
   student subsequently fails during prescribed additional training sorties, the SQ/CC should
   recommend elimination.
4.3. Elimination Check (EC). Unit commander’s use the EC to assess a student’s overall
flying skills and potential to meet syllabus and MAJCOM requirements. SQ/CCs should
consider an EC for sustained substandard performance or doubtful potential to complete formal
training. EC’s are not intended to comply with AFI 11-202, Volume 2 requirements, but to
assess the student’s ability to accept instruction and potential for course completion. Group
evaluators will fly ECs.
   4.3.1. The overall mission grade for an EC will be proficient (P); satisfactory (S); or
   unsatisfactory (U). For GTIMS grading, the mission grade with be satisfactory (3); low
   satisfactory (2); or unsatisfactory (0). In all cases, the unsatisfactory subareas that
   precipitated the EC will be sampled. An EC for procedural knowledge will consist of a
   ground evaluation and may include a ATD mission. All ATD missions must be coordinated
   with the ATS contractor. The EC will be documented in the student’s training record. Use
   EC-01, as applicable, for the mission number.
       4.3.1.1. A satisfactory (S) EC fulfills the requirements of the lesson/sortie that caused it
       to be accomplished and allows the student to continue training in the normal training
       syllabus flow at the next syllabus lesson/sortie. This check does not fulfill the
       requirements of an AFI 11-202, Volume 2 evaluation.
       4.3.1.2. An unsatisfactory (U) EC will result in entry into the CR process.
   4.3.2. ATD EC. SQ/CCs may direct training ATD ECs any time student performance
   warrants consideration for elimination. An Air Force or contract instructor will conduct
   ATD ECs, and at the same time, an evaluator will observe and decide whether the student
   should continue training. The student will meet course-training standards (CTS) to continue
   training.
   4.3.3. Ground Evaluation EC. EC ground evaluations may be conducted as a result of
   unsatisfactory general knowledge or emergency procedures knowledge or for failure to meet
   syllabus standards in procedural knowledge. The ground evaluation is not a collaborative
   effort. In all cases, the evaluator will conduct the briefing, ground evaluation execution,
   debriefing, and assign the overall grade.
AETCI362205V7 5 APRIL 2011                                                                   27


   4.3.4. Incomplete EC. An EC is incomplete only if mission tasks/events and objectives
   could not be completed, and a reasonable evaluation of student performance could not be
   made. Do not incomplete an aircraft EC for non-flying or ground items with a
   recommendation that additional ground lessons be administered by another qualified EC
   evaluator to determine the outcome of the EC.
4.4. Commander’s Review (CR) Process (Note: Not applicable to simulator/system refresher
courses). When students demonstrate a lack of potential to meet training standards, the squadron
commander will recommend elimination. Use AETC Form 126G, Record of Commander’s
Review Action (Graduate Flying Training), to complete the CR process. For specific
responsibilities and guidance on the AETC Form 126G refer to Attachment 3 -- see Attachment
4 for overview of process. Note: Complete the CR process within 10 duty days (24 duty days
for international students) from the date the initiating authority (IA) signs AETC Form 126G.
4.5. CR Records Distribution. Distribute copies of CR records on eliminated students within
10 duty days of completion of the CR process. The originating base registrar office will
maintain the original CR record.
   4.5.1. Send a copy of the completed AETC Form 126G to the office performing course
   registrar duties. The course registrar will ensure HQ AETC/A3RA is informed of every
   elimination from training so the MilPDS system can be updated with an elimination code.
   4.5.2. The HARM office will update the aviation resource management system (ARMS)
   with the appropriate disqualification code according to AFI 11-402/AETC SUP.
   4.5.3. Table 4.1 provides guidance on distribution of CR records. Maintain these records
   according to Air Force RDS.

4.6. Student Eliminations.
      4.6.1. Students will be considered for elimination if they:
         4.6.1.1. Exhibit lack of adaptability (LOA), which is the inability to complete the course
         because of physical, psychological, or personality factors. LOA eliminees require an
         evaluation from both medical and rated personnel. This category includes airsickness
         and manifestation of apprehension (MOA). Specific deficiencies are annotated on AF
         IMT 174, or AETC Form 173, (AF IMT 174 is prescribed in AFI 36-2907, Unfavorable
         Information File (UIF) Program. AETC Form 173 is prescribed in AETCI 36-2215,
AETCI362205V7 5 APRIL 2011                                                                       29


       Training Administration. Refer to those publications for guidance on filling out the
       forms.)
       4.6.1.2. Fail to meet syllabus proficiency standard in flying, academics or procedures.
       4.6.1.3. Fail to demonstrate the potential to complete the course within syllabus
       constraints.
       4.6.1.4. Engage in misconduct punishable under the articles of the Uniform Code of
       Military Justice (UCMJ).
       4.6.1.5. Demonstrate improper conduct, attitude, or lack of responsibility toward
       assigned duties or obligations. This may include character disorders that raise doubt
       about the student’s fitness for continued service. WG/CCs should contact 19 AF/DO for
       guidance in specific situations.
   4.6.2. Students are eliminated if they:
       4.6.2.1. Become medically disqualified; see AETCI 48-102 for initial CEA guidance and
       AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1 for officers and qualified/previously qualified CEAs.
       4.6.2.2. Initiate action to separate from the service.
       4.6.2.3. Are adjudicated absent without leave, are confined, or have deserted.
       4.6.2.4. Are involved in drug abuse substantiated by reliable evidence.
       4.6.2.5. Fail to meet standards prescribed in AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program.
   4.6.3. Students will be disenrolled if they:
       4.6.3.1. Are recalled by the parent unit or higher headquarters.
       4.6.3.2. Are hospitalized for an extended period as determined by the OG/CC. Student
       may be considered for reinstatement at a later date. See AETCI 48-102 and 36-2205,
       Volume 1.
       4.6.3.3. Have not met course entry prerequisites and have not received an approved entry
       waiver.
       4.6.3.4. Experience difficulties in an instructor upgrade course where the problem
       specifically concerns the student’s lack of instructional ability rather than a lack of
       proficiency.
   4.6.4. Records Distribution Following Elimination. Follow guidance according to AFI 11-
   402/AETC SUP and the Air Force RDS.
4.7. Student Dispositions. Students failing to complete the course of training will be processed
according to AFI 11-402/AETC SUP.

                                            Chapter 5

                      MEDICAL MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS

5.1. General. This chapter establishes student management requirements for appropriate
medical and operations personnel. Operations and medical personnel will ensure SQ/CCs are
informed when students exhibit MOA symptoms or other medical conditions that affect student
decisions. Supervisors must also strive to keep students motivated and flying on a regular basis.
5.2. Airsickness. Instructors will document the student’s training record when a student
experiences any form of airsickness. Comply with AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1. If airsickness
leads to significant deviation from training profile or prevents the student from meeting MIF
requirements, the student will be referred to the FS for evaluation according to AFI 48-123. This
will be accomplished prior the next flight. If the student is off station and no flight surgeon is
available, verbal approval will be obtained from a flight surgeon before the student flies the next
sortie. The student will report to the flight surgeon for evaluation upon return to home station
and will not fly again until cleared by a flight surgeon.
   5.2.1. Visually Induced Motion Sickness (VIMS). If VIMS is so severe that no simulator
   training can be accomplished, refer the student to the FS for evaluation of alternatives.
   Because VIMS is usually unrelated to airsickness, do not consider students for elimination
   based solely on VIMS episodes.
5.3. Manifestation of Apprehension (MOA). Instructors will document the student’s training
record when a student experiences MOA. Refer to AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1, for guidance
concerning MOA issues.
5.4. Administrative Hold Status. Refer to AETCI 48-102 for initial CEAs and AETCI 36-
2205 Volume 1 for officers and qualified/previously qualified CEA guidance.
5.5. Administrative Requirements for Flying Training Supervisors and Flight Surgeons:
   5.5.1. FSs will provide flying training supervisors a list of flying restrictions for each student
   entering training. Flying training supervisors will forward these restrictions to gaining units.
   5.5.2. An instructor or squadron supervisor may direct a student to visit the FS, or a student
   may self-initiate the visit.
   5.5.3. Every visit to the FS or physiology training officer (PTO) will be documented. For
   directed visits, the student hand carries the documentation to the FS or PTO. The FS reviews
   documentation, annotates any recommended flying restrictions, and dates and signs the
   documentation. The student will return the documentation to the FLT/CC for inclusion in the
   training record. If the student initiates the visit, the FS or PTO will provide the
   documentation to the student, who will return it to the FLT/CC.
AETCI362205V7 5 APRIL 2011                                                                     31


   5.5.4. If a student’s DNIF status changes, the FS’s office will inform the student’s flying
   squadron of this either by telephone conference or via a copy of AF IMT 1042, Medical
   Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty (or another Service’s equivalent).
   Simulation training during DNIF status may be acceptable, and the FS should address this on
   AF IMT 1042. The appropriate supervisor will approve dental and FS examinations (other
   than sick call and emergencies) before scheduling a dental or FS appointment. (AF IMT 1042
   is prescribed in AFI 48-123, Volume 3. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling out
   the form.)
