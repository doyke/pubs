SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction incorporates changes to the provisions and procedures for recording, controlling
and reporting of pay-related T&A data for Local National (LN) employees in Germany that
result from new or modified tariff or legal provisions. It contains especially completely revised
instructions in regards to the handling and processing of one day duty travels and on-call duty.
The LNTAP User Manual contains extensive technical directions for the regular use of the
program.

1. Policy:
     1.1. Applicability: This instruction is applicable to
        1.1.1. LN employees in Germany who are employed with the U.S. Air Force and
        organizations serviced by it under the terms of the CTA II. The term "Local National
        employee" used in this instruction includes employees in so-called Civilian Support
        organizations.
        1.1.2. LN employees in Germany who are paid from appropriated or non-appropriated
        funds.
        1.1.3. Supervisors of LN employees (LN and U.S. military and civilian supervisors), as
        well as employees who keep T&A records of LN employees.
     1.2. Purpose: T&A data of LN employees has to be recorded and reported in strict
     compliance with employment and tariff provisions to ensure accurate and timely payments,
     prevent abuse, and enable labor cost control. This instruction:
        1.2.1. Establishes principles and procedures to ensure accurate and timely payment of
        wages and salaries for LN employees.
        1.2.2. Establishes procedures for the recording, control, and reporting of T&A data.
        1.2.3. Contains provisions and checklists for Civilian Personnel Section (CPS)
        representatives to control keeping of T&A reports (Attachment 3).
     1.3. Provisions:
        1.3.1. USAFE Form 857, Leave Request (Urlaubsantrag) will be used for requesting and
        authorizing annual leave, leave without pay, and administrative leave. This also applies
        for requesting additional leave for employees whose status in accordance with the
        Severely Handicapped Persons Legislation (CSL IX) has been recognized by the
        responsible authority.
        1.3.2. USAFE Form 594, Travel Roster for One-Day Duty Travel (Nachweis für
        Dienstfahrten/ Dienstgänge) must be used by all LN employees serviced by the US Air
        Force in Germany to input and document one day duty travels and vicinity travel within a
        radius of 15 kilometers from the employing organization. It is mandatory to annotate the
        seven-digit LN personnel number as reflected in LNTAP on the form. The signed
        original must be submitted together with related original receipts (parking fees, railway
        tickets, taxi receipts, etc.) through the servicing CPS to the FFPO in Kaiserslautern. Data
        affecting one day duty travels and vicinity travel is not allowed to be locally entered into
USAFEI36-709 9 APRIL 2012                                                                       3


     LNTAP. The FFPO is responsible for the correct input of the relevant information into
     the system.
     1.3.3. On-call duty:
        1.3.3.1. Additional hours of work that served as overtime work and additional hours
        of work related to on-call duty are to be recorded separately. Overtime work hours
        that were not served in the context of on-call duty will be reported in LNTAP with
        pay code 250. Pay codes 252, 254, etc. will be used for the corresponding overtime
        supplements.
        1.3.3.2. The period from the end of the working time on one workday until the
        beginning of the working time on the next workday is considered the period of on-call
        duty. This period may also consist of several days, e.g. when there is a legal holiday,
        a weekend, or a combination of both in between. In other words, a period of time that
        is not interrupted by regular working time, annual leave, sick leave, or administrative
        leave is considered a period of on-call duty. Days of absence based on other
        provisions (e.g. shop agreement on US holidays) will be treated like
        weekends/holidays except for the lump sum supplement of only 12.5%.
        1.3.3.3. Hours of work actually served during the period of on-call duty will be
        reported with pay code 458. Pay codes 252 to 254 will be used for the corresponding
        overtime supplements as well. Depending on the time when the work is performed,
        there may be additional supplements for work at night, during Sundays, or on
        holidays.
        1.3.3.4. If in the context of the on-call duty there are so-called top-up overtime hours
        these (and these exclusively) have to be recorded with pay code 459. In this case, pay
        codes 252 to 254 will also be utilized for the corresponding overtime supplements. In
        case of supplements for work during the night, on Sundays, and on holidays, only the
        hours of actual work will be considered and entered.
        1.3.3.5. Official telephone calls during on-call duty are considered actual working
        time and will be remunerated for as at least one hour or, if that period is exceeded, for
        the actual time spent (for official phone calls) and recorded with pay code 459. Pay
        codes 252 to 254 will be used for the pertinent overtime supplements. If applicable,
        supplements for work during the night, on Sundays, and on holidays have to be
        recorded for the actually accrued time (not the top-up overtime hours).
        1.3.3.6. Particularities regarding official telephone calls: Several telephone calls will
        be added. The rounding-off to one hour will only be done after all individual calls
        during a period of on-call duty are added up. If, in addition to the official phone calls,
        the employee is called in to work to a duty location/his regular duty location the
        periods of official telephone calls at the residence will be added to the periods of
        actual work performed on site. In this case a rounding-off IAW paragraph 1.3.3.4
        will only be done if the telephone calls and the actually performed work do not add
        up to three hours. For all variations of rounding-off, supplements for work during the
        night, on Sundays, and on holidays will only be entered for the actual duration of
        work.
 4                                                                USAFEI36-709 9 APRIL 2012


            1.3.3.7. By all means, it has to be ensured that overtime hours are not recorded twice.
            Regular overtime hours will be entered with pay code 250; overtime work hours (to
            include commuting periods) served during on-call duty with pay code 458; and top-up
            overtime hours, as well as overtime hours due to official telephone calls during which
            the employee remains at his residence with pay code 459. All entries with pay codes
            120, 250, 458, and 459 have to be preceded by the records under pay code 001 to
            indicate that these hours were worked in addition to the regular daily working hours.
            1.3.3.8. Special provisions on travelling with a POV during on-call duty: TDY and
            one day duty travel data documented on a USAFE Form 594 are no longer inputted
            by the timekeeper into LNTAP, but submitted through the servicing CPS to the FFPO
            for further action and data input IAW paragraph 1.3.2. In the opposite thereto travel
            costs occurring during on-call duty must still be coded into LNTAP by the timekeeper
            using pay code 146. Since these expenses are also documented by the employee on a
            USAFE Form 594, it is mandatory that the timekeeper (manually) earmark the form
            in these cases to clearly indicate that the travel costs are related to on-call duty. To
            achieve this, the expression ―On-Call Duty‖ must be annotated in column H and/or
            needs to be color coded/highlighted. There is no other alternative to ensure that the
            FFPO does not enter the amount a second time thus triggering double payments for
            the employee.
        1.3.4. Effective immediately requested and approved paid release from work according
        to the provisions of CTA II Art. 20 Nr 1-5 must be reported in LNTAP in hours without a
        DUEVO code. Input must always start with pay code 004 followed by the paid release
        time in hours and the reference to the detailed provision in the tariff agreement.
        1.3.5. Signed printouts and copies of documents, e-mails, forms and printouts of advance
        notifications have to be kept at the employing organization for two years after the end of
        the calendar year. Unless they are needed as exhibits in appeals or court procedures they
        are then to be destroyed.
        1.3.6. If compelling emergencies, e.g. extended non-availability of CPS service due to an
        act of god, require the sending of pay-related documentation directly to the FFPO, the
        services of the German Mail may be used in accordance with the U.S. Forces’ official
        mail policy.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. Under the guidance of the responsible CPS, management will:
        2.1.1. Ensure that supervisors understand the importance of accurately recording and
        timely reporting/transmission of T&A data.
        2.1.2. Mandate supervisors to participate in informational events offered by the
        responsible CPS.
        2.1.3. Correct deficiencies and errors in the reporting of T&A data of LN employees.
        2.1.4. Ensure that required data processing equipment is available at the employing
        organizations.
     2.2. Supervisors will:

       2.2.1. Ensure that entries into the Local National Time and Attendance Program
       (LNTAP) will be done correctly, or that manually prepared T&A reports are accurately

       2.2.2. Review T&A data for correctness and compliance with appropriate instructions
       before transmitting them.
       2.2.3. Ensure that annual leave is tracked by utilizing USAFE Form 202, Annual Leave
       Record (Urlaubskontrollkarte).
       2.2.4. Control and report T&A data for subordinates who are on temporary duty (TDY).
       2.2.5. Ensure that their employees submit travel expense vouchers only to the
       responsible CPS for review and forwarding to the FFPO after completion of the TDY.
       2.2.6. Contact the responsible CPS for advice on policy and procedures.
       2.2.7. Instruct timekeepers to participate in LNTAP training measures offered by the
       responsible CPS.
       2.2.8. Respond promptly on FFPO inquiries about T&A data.
   2.3. Civilian Personnel Officers will:
       2.3.1. Assist and advise supervisors and timekeepers upon their request with the
       recording of T&A data or the completion of T&A reports.
       2.3.2. Support management in the effective control of T&A data reporting and advise
       them of problem areas and changes.
       2.3.3. Periodically check the reporting of T&A data (Attachment 3).
       2.3.4. Conduct information events for supervisors and training classes for timekeepers.
3. Certification Authority:
   3.1. Use Department of Defense (DD) Form 577, Appointment/Termination Record -
   Authorized Signature to authorize supervisors to certify T&A documents. List on the card
   the payroll numbers for which certification authority is delegated. Two copies of the form
   have to be completed. The first copy is for the responsible CPS. The second copy is for the
   employing organization which has to inform the CPS immediately and in writing on changes
   of the signature and certification authority.
   3.2. The number of officials with signature and certification authority has to be kept to a
   minimum to facilitate controls and reduce the risk of falsification. Authorization will be
   limited to immediate and next-level supervisors.
   3.3. In case of doubt or uncertainties regarding the correctness of entries in the T&A report,
   the authorized signatories have to contact the CPS to obtain advice and support. They must
   not sign the T&A report until all questions have been resolved.
   3.4. Supervisors are not authorized to sign the monthly printouts of their own T&A report,
   and timekeepers are not authorized to sign the T&A report of their supervisors.
   3.5. Signature on monthly printouts of the T&A reports and on relevant T&A documentation
   (e.g. leave requests) have to be handwritten. The use of facsimile stamps is prohibited.

4. Special Provisions for Works Councils:
     4.1. The agency chief, the Civilian Personnel Officer or a designated representative will sign
     the T&A reports for works council members who are released from their regular duties in
     accordance with the Federal Personnel Representation Law (FPRL) Art. 46 (4).
     4.2. The chairperson will sign the T&A reports for clerical personnel employed with the
     Works Council.
     4.3. The chairperson may also be authorized to sign T&A reports for other full-time released
     works council members. Officials vested with this authority are not responsible for verifying
     if other released works council members have been performing works council functions
     during the time of release if they certify a T&A report listing works council members.
5. German Data Transmission Ordinance Calendar and Pay Code Entries:
     5.1. Both the German Data Transmission Ordinance Calendar code (Attachment 4) and the
     pay code (Attachment 5) will be recorded monthly in LNTAP and daily on USAFE Form
     591, Record of Exceptions to Regular Pay and Attendance. Instead of USAFE Form 591
     other adequate documentation may be used in exceptional cases. Table 1 depicts the relation
     between DTO entries and pay codes:

Table 1. DTO Entries and Pay Codes.

USAFEI36-709 9 APRIL 2012                                                                          7


   5.2. In accordance with German law, the FFPO has to report absences that are entered into
   the DTO Calendar to the social insurance carriers and therefore has to use the codes
   prescribed by this instruction.
   5.3. The FFPO uses the pay code entries as the basis for wage and salary calculations.
   Hence, all events affecting wage and salary payments have to be included in these columns.
6. Advance Notification to the FFPO:
   6.1. Advance notifications are necessary to report events that may result in underpayment or
   overpayment of an employee if they are not promptly reported to the FFPO. Reportable
   events are listed in Attachment 4. For the listed events, advance notifications are
   mandatory.
   6.2. Timekeepers will draft and submit the advance notification as an e-mail in LNTAP
   (Figure 1) to the FFPO on the same day a reportable event occurs or becomes known.
   Annual leave or additional leave of severely handicapped employees (codes S, U, and V) do
   not have to be reported. The advance notification e-mail will be printed out and be kept at
   the employing organization.

Figure 1. Format of an Advance Notification to the FFPO.




   6.3. In case of an e-mail server malfunction, a printout of the e-mail including the employing
   organization number and payroll number has to be sent as quickly as possible either through
   the responsible CPS or via German mail directly to the Controlling and Services Directorate,
   FFPO (Aufsichts- und Dienstleistungsdirektion, Lohnstelle Ausländische Streitkräfte,
   Postfach 3280, 67620 Kaiserslautern).
7. Time and Attendance Reporting - Daily Report:
   7.1. Entries in LNTAP are used to automatically generate and certify the monthly report, to
   allow for retroactive verification of daily data, and to provide data for establishing statistics.
 8                                                                USAFEI36-709 9 APRIL 2012


     7.2. All entries have to be made in the daily reports to obtain a complete final monthly T&A
     report. At the end of the month, the pertinent USAFE Form 591, Record of Exceptions to
     Regular Pay and Attendance has to be signed by the authorized supervisor before the feature
     to generate the final monthly T&A report is executed.
     7.3. Documents that justify absences or payments (leave requests, certificates of unfitness
     for work, etc.) will be filed with the printouts of the respective final monthly T&A report.
     7.4. At least once a week (for the period from Monday through Sunday), timekeepers should
     make entries in LNTAP if entries are required in the column "Code Hours" of the screen
     mask (i.e. when changes to regular pay or absences have to be reported).
     7.5. If the same pay code is valid for several consecutive days or the whole month, the entry
     "from - to" will be made to record the duration. Exceptions will be entries for annual leave
     for the current calendar year (DTO code "U"), annual leave from the previous calendar year
     (DTO code "V"), and additional leave for severely handicapped employees (DTO code "S").
     These entries must only reflect actual workdays (i.e. for a regular workweek from Monday
     through Friday no DTO entries shall be made for the weekend).
     7.6. For the number of hours decimals have to be entered. The smallest decimal will be 0.25
     (equaling 15 minutes). Smaller fractions will be rounded off to 15 minutes. Only 15-minute
     increments will be reported. (E.g. 12 minutes are equivalent to 0.25, 24 minutes to 0.50, 38
     minutes to 0.75, and 53 minutes to 1.00). This applies for all kinds of pay that have to be
     reported by hours.
     7.7. For detailed listings and explanations of the DTO codes see Attachment 4, for pay
     codes see Attachment 5. Table 2 contains instructions for completing USAFE Form 591,
     Record of Exceptions to Regular Pay and Attendance.

8. Final Monthly T&A Report:
   8.1. The final monthly T&A information is used to report pay-affecting exceptions to an
   employee’s regular attendance and performance to the FFPO.
   8.2. On the third workday of each month at the latest, timekeepers have to initiate the so
   called End-of-Month process and print out the final monthly T&A report from the previous
   month. Once the final monthly report has been printed, the date in the data base will
   immediately switch to the following month to preclude any further changes. Subsequent
   changes are only possible by running "Corrections to the Previous Month".
   8.3. If an employee separates or transfers to the U.S. Army or Army and Air Force Exchange
   Service (AAFES), a separate final report for the final month of employment has to be
   generated.
   8.4. Timely Transmission:
       8.4.1. The End-of-Month (EOM) Function in LNTAP has to be initiated no later than the
       third workday of each month. Data on separated employees that are received after the
       end date set by the FFPO can only be considered the following month. Therefore it is
       indispensable that the advance notification is transmitted in time to the FFPO
       (Attachment 4).
 10                                                              USAFEI36-709 9 APRIL 2012


      8.4.2. The transmission of the printout of the final monthly T&A report via the CPS to
      the FFPO is only authorized in an emergency situation as listed in Attachment 2
      (computer failure).
9. Corrections:
   9.1. If entries are found to be incorrect or incomplete after the final monthly T&A report has
   been generated, the timekeeper will initiate a "correction to previous month". If this mode
   has been selected for a certain employee and the respective month, the already transmitted
   data will show on the screen. Timekeepers will correct or complete these data.
   9.2. The corrected final monthly T&A report has to contain all information on the respective
   employee, not just the corrections or additions.
   9.3. Payroll data that was already transmitted may only be changed on the basis of correction
   reports. Corrections made have to be recorded and be available for documentation purposes
   and be kept accordingly.
10. Audits:
   10.1. Audits will be conducted to verify if instructions, laws, and tariff provisions were
   adhered to when generating the T&A reports, or to ensure future compliance. To that end,
   only the checklist in Attachment 3 may be used. Additional data and documents may be
   audited for cogent reasons.
   10.2. Each serviced organization should be audited at least once during a period of two calendar
   years. During the first month of the new calendar year, the responsible CPS will establish a
   corresponding audit schedule that will be sent to the employing organizations’ chiefs.
   10.3. Audits will be conducted as random samples. They should include the following:
      10.3.1. A review of T&A reports for compliance with the CTA II, valid German labor
      law, and applicable instructions.
      10.3.2. A comparison of the employing organizations filed monthly timesheets and the
      daily T&A records.
      10.3.3. Verification of certificates (certificates of unfitness for work, leave requests,
      etc.).
      10.3.4. A comparison of selected filed T&A reports with those that were transmitted to
      the FFPO. Upon request by the responsible CPS, the FFPO will provide copies of the
      T&A reports.
   10.4. The responsible CPS will provide a written report on the results to the chief of the
   audited agency within four weeks after the start of the audit. The chief of the employing
   agency will have three weeks to comment on the report and possibly specify which corrective
   actions will be taken.

NOTES:
1. Codes 001 to 004 will not appear on the automatically generated final monthly T&A report.

2. Part-time employees:

Example 1: Employee worked 23 hours during the workweek instead of the weekly scheduled 20 hours:
Pay code 120 = 3.00 (basic compensation).

Example 2: Employee worked 21 hours instead of the scheduled 20 hours; the additional hour was
worked on a Sunday: Pay code 120 = 3.00 (basic compensation in accordance with CTA II, Art. 12 Para.
3b) and additional pay code 362 = 3.00 (Sunday work supplement). For part-time employees who
worked additional hours on Sundays or holidays, these hours must always be reported with pay code 120
and the applicable code for pay supplements.

3. Full-time employees:

Example: The employee worked 1 hour overtime on Sunday: Pay code 250 = 1.00 (basic compensation
for overtime), pay code 252 = 1.00 (overtime work supplement), pay code 120 = 2.00 (basic
compensation for compensatory time in accordance with CTA II, Art. 12, Para. 3b) and pay code 362 =
3.00 (Sunday work supplement in accordance with CTA II, Art. 12, Para. 3b).

4. The final monthly T&A report is generated in LNTAP with the entries that are made in the daily T&A
record. Since supplements for overtime work hours are not calculated based on daily work hours, it is
indispensable to make the entries for pay codes 250 to 254 each week (for the period from Monday
through Sunday). The entries for overtime work hours of the previous week (Monday through Sunday)
should be made on the following Monday. If T&A reports are manually established, only pay codes 250
to 254 are to be used. See code 001 for additional hours worked on a specific day.

5. In view of the revised provisions regarding the processing of One Day Duty Travels timekeepers must
avoid any inputs in pay codes 556, 558, 559, 560, 571, 573, 574 and 579. Only for technical reasons
these pay codes are not blocked in LNTAP.
