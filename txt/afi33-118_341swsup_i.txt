                                               Chapter 1

                   MANAGING THE RADIO FREQUENCY (RF) SPECTRUM

1.1. General. Both national and international regulatory bodies require effective and efficient use of the
electromagnetic spectrum. Effective and efficient use is defined as applying design or operational tech-
niques that conservatively use electromagnetic spectrum in a compatible (i.e., non-interference) manner.
Mark, store, control, and transmit security classification of Air Force frequency records, DD Form 1494,
Application for Equipment Frequency Allocation, or other related documents according to DOD
5200.1-R, Information Security Program, January 1997; AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
Management: and USMCEB-M-019-98, DOD Frequency Assignment Classification Reference (see
Attachment 2).

1.2. International Spectrum Management. The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is the
international body responsible for international frequency allocations, worldwide telecommunications
standards and telecommunications development activities.
   1.2.1. The United States (US) is one member of the nations that make up the ITU. International agree-
   ments signed by the President and ratified by the US Senate gain treaty status.
   1.2.2. The electromagnetic spectrum is a natural resource independently managed by each sovereign
   nation within their boundaries. This basic consideration of international spectrum management
   becomes extremely important when US military forces operate abroad. Units must obtain host nation
   approval to use frequencies before US forces can legally operate.

1.3. US National Spectrum Management. Title 47, United States Code (U.S.C.), Telegraphs, Tele-
phones, and Radiotelegraphs, Section 151 et seq., The Communications Act of 1934, established separate
control of federal (government) and non-federal (civilian) use of the electromagnetic spectrum. Under this
act, the only government agencies that assign and control the use of frequencies in the US are the NTIA
and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) (Figure 1.1.).
   1.3.1. The NTIA assigns and regulates frequencies for federal users. The NTIA Manual written by the
   NTIA governs all federal (including military) use of the electromagnetic spectrum within the United
   States and its Possessions (US&P).
   1.3.2. The FCC assigns and regulates frequencies for non-federal users. Non-federal users include
   private citizens, companies, and state and local government users.
   1.3.3. The electromagnetic spectrum is allocated between federal and non-federal users with portions
   of the spectrum shared (see NTIA Manual). Federal users must utilize frequency bands allocated for
   government or shared use. A government frequency assignment may be authorized in a non-govern-
   ment band provided the request is coordinated and granted approval by the FCC.

1.4. Department of Defense Spectrum Management. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,
Technology and Logistics (USD [AT&L]) sets policy for acquiring systems that use the electromagnetic
spectrum and ensures compliance with electromagnetic spectrum support procedures. The Assistant Sec-
retary of Defense develops overall DOD policy for managing and using the electromagnetic spectrum.
DOD activities involved in frequency management (see Figure 1.2.) are:
    1.4.1. US Military Communications Electronics-Board (USMCEB). The USMCEB develops joint
    policy and provides direction in military communications-electronics (C-E) matters.
       1.4.1.1. The USMCEB Joint Frequency Panel (JFP). The USMCEB JFP develops electromag-
       netic spectrum certification guidance for US military operations.

Figure 1.2. DOD Spectrum Management.




      1.4.1.2. DOD Area Frequency Coordinator (AFC). The DOD AFCs are responsible for ensuring
      successful frequency coordination in the areas that lie within, are adjacent to, or are within radio
      line-of-sight to any range spectrum dependent system, including all systems brought to a national
      test range or other designated complex. Activities must coordinate all military frequency use
      within a DOD AFC area of responsibility (AOR) with the appropriate DOD AFC before starting
      operations. DOD AFCs are directly responsible to their military department for administrative
      purposes and to the USMCEB for policy guidance. The Allied Communications Publication
      (ACP) 190/US Supp 1, (C) Guide to Frequency Planning (U), contains specific policy guidance.
      Refer to NTIA Manual, Appendix D for a list of the DOD AFC geographic descriptions,
      addresses, and phone numbers.
         1.4.1.2.1. Air Force-Sponsored Department of Defense Area Frequency Coordinators. The
         Air Force provides DOD AFC services at the following locations:
             1.4.1.2.1.1. Headquarters Air Force Materiel Command (HQ AFMC) provides support to
             the Gulf AFC at Eglin AFB FL.
             1.4.1.2.1.2. Headquarters Air Force Space Command provides support to the Eastern AFC
             at Patrick AFB FL.
             1.4.1.2.1.3. Headquarters Air Combat Command (HQ ACC) provides support to the Nel-
             lis AFC at Nellis AFB NV.
         1.4.1.2.2. Air Force-sponsored DOD AFCs:
             1.4.1.2.2.1. Manage and coordinate the use of frequencies for the range commanders
             according to ACP 190/US SUPP 1 and the NTIA Manual.

              1.4.1.2.2.2. Ensure compliance with DOD electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) program.
              1.4.1.2.2.3. Ensure compliance of range and range-hosted spectrum dependent systems
              with national and DOD spectrum management regulations, policies, and procedures.
              1.4.1.2.2.4. Make temporary frequency assignments supporting range operations within
              the scope of the NTIA Manual.
              1.4.1.2.2.5. Review new or changed DD Form 1494s for impact on range electromagnetic
              spectrum use, and provide comments to the AFFMA, when appropriate.
              1.4.1.2.2.6. Advise the range or area commander, and all affected organizations, of RF
              interference that may result from scheduled operations and tests, and recommend solu-
              tions. Mutual resolution of conflicts is the responsibility of the commanders concerned.
              1.4.1.2.2.7. Review and evaluate frequency assignment requests proposed for use within

                                   SPECTRUM CERTIFICATION

2.1. Process and Guidance. Spectrum certification is the process of reviewing the equipment character-
istics to determine realistic supportability expectations to include conformance with the international and
national allocation tables, and EMC standards (see Figure 2.1.). This process, often referred to as equip-
ment certification, is required for all RF emitters (transmitters or receivers) including COTS and
non-developmental items purchased, unless specifically exempt, as stated in the NTIA Manual. Following
the certification process, obtain a frequency assignment approval for each discrete frequency required in
order to have authority to operate. AFMAN 33-120 details the specifics and requirements of the process.
   2.1.1. DODD 4650.1 requires all DOD components to obtain RF guidance (spectrum certification)
   for communications-electronics systems from the USMCEB. Components must obtain guidance
   before assuming contractual obligations for the full-scale development, production, or procurement of
   those systems. Perform spectrum certification by submitting a DD Form 1494.

2.2. Allocation Tables. Frequency allocation tables represent the general electromagnetic spectrum use
plan nationally and internationally (each nation that manages their RF resources has a national table).
Separate the allocation tables based on type of service (i.e., fixed service, aeronautical mobile service,
etc.). Make every effort to plan equipment design, and use the electromagnetic spectrum in accordance
with the allocation tables. Any frequency use not in compliance with the allocation tables requires proof
that interference with authorized users will not occur before a nation will grant access. The Air Force, as
a US Government body, must use US Government allocated bands. Use of non-government bands must
be justified and assessed for compatibility. The NTIA Manual contains international and national alloca-
tion tables. NTIA manual will reflect known and probable future changes in the allocation tables. Systems
that do not comply with the allocation tables will not receive primary use status.

Figure 2.1. Spectrum Certification Flowchart.




2.3. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Standards. Air Force agencies developing, procuring, or
modifying equipment using the electromagnetic spectrum must do everything possible to meet applicable
international, national, military, and host-nation EMC standards. Noncompliance may result in the denial
of frequency authorization or severe operational restrictions.
     2.3.1. National EMC Standards. The NTIA Manual contains the Radio Frequency Spectrum Stan-
     dards. All communications-electronics systems will comply with the standards in the NTIA Manual.
     If compliance is not technically possible, proof that noncompliance will not cause unintended electro-
     magnetic interference (EMI) is required. Operations may be authorized on a non-interference basis.
     As stated in the NTIA Manual, “In any instance of harmful interference caused by nonconformance
     with the provisions of this chapter, the responsibility for eliminating the harmful interference nor-
     mally shall rest with the agency operating in nonconformance.”
     2.3.2. Military EMC Standards. Include military EMC standards in equipment design specifications
     according to the EMC guidance and DOD Manual 4120.24-M, DOD Standardization Program (DSP)
     Policies and Procedures, March 2000. Request waivers to EMC standards through program manage-
     ment channels according to DODD 3222.3/AFSUP 1, Department of Defense Electromagnetic Com-
     patibility Program (EMCP) (Air Force Electromagnetic Environmental Effects Program).

   2.3.3. Host-Nation EMC Standards. Host-nation authorities consider host nation EMC standards dur-
   ing the DD Form 1494 coordination process.

2.4. Equipment Exempt from Spectrum Certification. The following categories of equipment in the
US&P are exempt from the spectrum certification process. If any devices listed below are to be used out-
side US&P, spectrum certification is required prior to procurement.

     2.4.21. Antennas that do not radiate RF energy unless excited (or interrogated) from a separate trans-
     mitting source.

2.5. DD Form 1494 Submission. Using Activities, program/project offices or acquisition activities must
generate and submit the DD Form 1494 to their local system centers, logistics centers, installation or facil-
ity SMO for further processing in support of the development, modification or acquisition of wireless RF
devices including COTS, government-off-the-shelf, or non-developmental items. Data for the application
can be obtained from the originator through any available sources, i.e., contractor support, manufacturer,
etc. The local SMO will submit a complete and accurate application to their applicable MAJCOM SMO.
The MAJCOM SMO will then send the completed application directly to AFFMA/DON. Using activities,
program/project offices or acquisition activities without local or MAJCOM SMOs will submit the appli-
cation directly to AFFMA/DON.
     2.5.1. The DD Form 1494 is processed in stages that closely parallel standard Air Force acquisition
     milestones via the following four stages. The System Program Office, with contractor support, sub-
     mits the DD Form 1494 for the appropriate stage as it matures into an operational status. These stages
     are:
        2.5.1.1. Stage 1. Conceptual: Initial system planning has been completed. This stage advises on
        the feasibility of getting spectrum support and recommends modifications or changes in frequency
        bands.
        2.5.1.2. Stage 2. Experimental: Preliminary system design has been completed. Certification at
        this stage provides guidance for assuring spectrum support in later stages, and is needed before
        obtaining frequency assignments for experimental testing.
        2.5.1.3. Stage 3. Developmental: Major system design has been completed. As the system design
        is nearly finalized, this stage provides guidelines for assuring spectrum support needed before
        obtaining frequency assignments for developmental testing.
        2.5.1.4. Stage 4. Operational: System development is complete. Certifies availability of spectrum
        support and identifies operating restrictions before making operational frequency assignments.

2.6. DD Form 1494. Submit a DD Form 1494 for each stage of development using the following lead
times:
     2.6.1. Stage 1. Planning or Conceptual:
        2.6.1.1. Space Systems. Not earlier than seven years and not later than two years before satellite
        launch.
        2.6.1.2. All Other Systems. Not less than one year before initial testing begins.
     2.6.2. Stage 2. Experimental:
        2.6.2.1. Space Systems. Not less than one year prior to planned operation.

      2.6.4.2. All Other Systems. Not less than nine months prior to the Milestone C Decision or con-
      tractual obligations for operational procurement or acquisition activities involving wireless RF
      devices.

2.7. Note-to-Holders. Use the USMCEB Note-to-Holders for amendments and updates to approved DD
Form1494 documents and USMCEB memoranda. Distribute host nation comments to applications by a
Note-to-Holder.
   2.7.1. A Note-to-Holders to distribute host nation and COCOM comments received about an applica-
   tion is created by the AFFMA, approved by the USMCEB Equipment Spectrum Guidance Permanent
   Working Groups, and distributed to the USMCEB J-12 distribution list.
   2.7.2. Send requests for Note-to-Holders through established frequency management channels to the
   AFFMA.

2.8. Acknowledgment of USMCEB Guidance. The program office or using activity must acknowledge
receipt of the USMCEB guidance within 60 days of receipt and notify the supporting MAJCOM of any
concerns. Silence procedures apply.

2.9. Additional Guidance for use Outside the US&P.
   2.9.1. Foreign Disclosure. Obtain foreign disclosure in advance of coordinating host-nation spectrum
   support for Air Force systems designed or planned to operate outside the US&P. The field-level for-
   eign disclosure office (FDO), the MAJCOM FDO, or the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/IAPD) dis-
   closure office provides disclosure guidelines according to AFI 16-201, (C) Disclosure of Military
   Information to Foreign Governments (U).
      2.9.1.1. Mark the DD Form 1494 Foreign Coordination page with the appropriate releasability
      statement provided by the FDO. “This information is furnished upon condition that it will not be
      released to another nation without specific authority of the Department of the Air Force of the
      United States, that it will be used for military purposes only, that individual or corporate rights
      originating the information, whether patented or not, will be respected, that the recipient will
      report promptly to the United States any known or suspected compromise, and that the informa-
      tion will be provided substantially the same degree of security afforded it by DOD of the United
      States.”
      2.9.1.2. The local SMO ensures that foreign disclosure approval is obtained, including the
      field-level FDO case number and provides a copy of the approval release with the DD Form 1494
      through the chain of command to AFFMA. If field-level disclosure approval is not received due to
      lack of delegated disclosure authority at the field level, notify the MAJCOM SMO.
      2.9.1.3. To ensure timely program implementation; host nation coordination must begin at stage 1
      or stage 2 if sufficient data is available, and not later than (NLT) stage 3.

                                       FREQUENCY ACTIONS

3.1. Frequency Assignment Guidance. The installation commander can prohibit use of ANY RF emit-
ter (cease and desist) when anticipating or resolving interference to mission essential electromagnetic
equipment. All RF emitters must have a frequency assignment prior to operation. Before making a perma-
nent or temporary frequency assignment, the USMCEB must review the RF equipment via a DD Form
1494, unless specifically exempted in paragraph 2.4. Frequency assignment parameters must match the
technical characteristics of the equipment as recommended in the USMCEB guidance. AFMAN 33-120
details the specifics and requirements of this process.

3.2. Types of Frequency Assignments. There are four types of frequency assignments:
   3.2.1. Regular: A frequency assignment for an unspecified period of time; however, a periodic review
   of the assignment is required. Regular assignments will have a Standard Frequency Action Format
   (SFAF) item 142 (Review date).
   3.2.2. Temporary: A frequency assignment for a specified period of time, more than 90 days but less
   than five years. Temporary assignments with a SFAF item 141 (Expiration date) may be renewed for
   additional periods, if necessary. Coordinate this type of assignment at the national level and submit to
   the Frequency Assignment Subcommittee (FAS) for approval and recommendation to the NTIA for
   assignment. The assignment with an appropriate expiration date is entered into the GMF.
       3.2.2.1. Short-Term-Temporary: Air Force users may apply for a short-term, limited, temporary
       assignment up to 90 days. This type of temporary assignment is not entered into the GMF and is
       renewable up to a total of 180 days from the initial date of assignments. Limit short-term, tempo-
       rary assignments to urgent requirements (i.e., exercises, contingencies, short training periods, or to
       test/evaluate experimental equipment).
   3.2.3. Trial: A frequency assignment for the purpose of selecting a suitable specific operating fre-
   quency for regular assignment.
   3.2.4. Group: A frequency assignment made only to terrestrial stations and provides authority to
   operate but does not represent continuing operations, or provide an assignment for planning purposes.
   There are two types:
       3.2.4.1. Authority to operate - this type does not represent continuing operations. Note S322 shall
       be used in SFAF line number 500.
       3.2.4.2. Planning - this type represents continuing or definitely anticipated requirements. Note
       S321 shall be used in SFAF line 500. The following applies to such assignments:
           3.2.4.2.1. Such assignments shall not exceed three years.
           3.2.4.2.2. The technical particulars of these assignments shall describe the intended use of the
           frequency to the maximum extent practical at the time of this application.
           3.2.4.2.3. Operations conducted under the authority of this type of assignment shall be limited
           to such uses as site surveys and path testing associated with the intended use. This type of
           assignment shall not be considered operational but strictly as a planning assignment set aside
22                                                     AFI33-118_341SWSUP_I 1 NOVEMBER 2007


            to satisfy an identified future requirement. However, all S321 assignments are accorded pro-
            tection and may be coordinated with Canada at the option of the applicant.

3.3. Frequency Applications. An application is used for the following frequency assignment actions
(SFAF 010), refer to NTIA Manual.
     3.3.1. New (N): To apply for a new frequency assignment.
     3.3.2. Modification (M): Used to apply for the addition, subtraction, or removal of information con-
     tained in an existing frequency assignment.
     3.3.3. Serial Replace Action: Used to delete an existing assignment from GMF and simultaneously
     replacing it with a new one.
     3.3.4. Renewal (R): To apply for the extension of a TEMPORARY or TRIAL assignment and to
     simultaneously update other particulars of the assignment.
     3.3.5. Administrative (A): This action is similar to a Modification (M) action; however, it is used to
     make three specific types of changes. The review date (Data Item 142) will not be automatically
     changed if an Administrative Modification action is used.
        3.3.5.1. Changes due to typographical errors in the authorizing document.
        3.3.5.2. Changes in administrative data items (e.g., 200 series).
        3.3.5.3. Mass changes required for compliance with international, national, or DOD rules and
        regulations.
     3.3.6. Deletion (D): To apply for the cancellation of a frequency assignment and the removal of all its
     particulars from the GMF and FRRS database.
     3.3.7. Temporary (N): To apply for a short-term (less than 90 days) assignment.

3.4. Lead-times. Lead-times provide federal agencies and overseas commands and host countries with
the time necessary to coordinate and process applications for frequency actions. If the following
lead-times are not met, the frequency request must include a mission impact statement if the assignment
is not granted by the date requested. Limit such requests to safety of life or urgent matters of national
security. In all cases, requesting commands must document when the requirement does not meet the
required lead-time.
     3.4.1. AFFMA lead-times for operations in the US&P. The lead-times below start when the AFFMA
     receives the request and does not include time required by the MAJCOM or intermediate agencies.
        3.4.1.1. Regular Assignments. Sixty days. In most cases, additional lead-time is required for
        actions requiring coordination with the FCC or the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
        Requirements that are not in accordance with the national table of allocations, or have unusual
        technical parameters, may require additional engineering time or study. It is not uncommon for
        such requests to take more than six months at the national-level.
        3.4.1.2. Temporary, Trial, and Group Assignments. Sixty days. For those types of temporary
        assignments requiring more than 90 days but less than five years for entry into the GMF. Addi-
        tional lead-time is needed for all actions requiring coordination with the FCC or FAA. Require-
        ments not in accordance with the national table of allocations, or have unusual technical
AFI33-118_341SWSUP_I 1 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                     23


       parameters may require additional engineering time or study, consequently requiring even longer
       lead-times.
           3.4.1.2.1. Temporary assignments (short-term) of less than 90 days require at least 30 days
           lead-time.
   3.4.2. For operations outside the US&P. Unified commands set lead-times for frequency actions
   based on agreements with host governments. Generally, theater COCOM Joint Frequency Manage-
   ment Offices (JFMO) requires a minimum of 90 days lead-time to process overseas requirements. The
   90-day time starts when the COCOM JFMO receives the request. Refer to theater instructions for spe-
   cific lead-times.

3.5. Frequency Coordination. The DOD does not own spectrum exclusively for military use. In fact,
spectrum is not owned by any organization, it is “allotted” and assigned. Either the FCC (state, local, pub-
lic and private users) or the DOC, NTIA (federal users) manages all spectrum. The DOD manages the
spectrum between 225 MHz and 399.9 MHz for the federal government (NTIA) and through the Military
Assignment Group. When it is necessary for the Air Force to use frequencies managed by another federal
department or agency, the Air Force must coordinate with the appropriate agency prior to submitting a
frequency request to the NTIA for assignment action. Coordinate frequency actions as outlined in para-
graphs 3.5.1. through 3.5.9. and include a statement of completed coordination and comments with the
frequency action.
   3.5.1. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Refer to the NTIA Manual for the civil fre-
   quency bands requiring coordination. The AFFMA completes final coordination with the FCC
   national office before submitting the request to the FAS for assignment action.
   3.5.2. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA manages certain frequency bands through
   the Aeronautical Assignment Group (AAG), a working group of the FAS. Coordination with the FAA
   regional office is required for all new and existing assignment modifications with changes in technical
   parameters prior to submitting the proposal to the AFFMA for national-level approval. Refer to
   AFMAN 33-120 for the appropriate FAA regional office, their corresponding AOR, and the fre-
   quency bands requiring coordination. The AFFMA, a member of the AAG, completes final coordina-
   tion with the AAG before submitting the request to the FAS for assignment action.
   3.5.3. DOD Area Frequency Coordinators (AFC). Coordinate frequency actions at, among, and
   within radio line-of-sight of ranges according to ACP 190, US SUPP-1, and the NTIA Manual. Refer
   to AFMAN 33-120 for the appropriate DOD AFC and a description of their corresponding AOR.
   3.5.4. Aerospace and Flight Test Radio Coordinating Council (AFTRCC). Coordinate all frequency
   requirements that fall within the 1435-1525 and 2360-2390 MHz band with the appropriate AFC prior
   to submission. The AFC coordinates with the AFTRCC coordinator. Refer to AFMAN 33-120 for the
   appropriate AFC and their corresponding areas of responsibility.
   3.5.5. Army. Coordinate all Air Force frequency requirements on an Army installation with the
   appropriate Army frequency coordinator prior to submission. Refer to AFMAN 33-120 for the appro-
   priate Army AFC and their corresponding AOR.
   3.5.6. Navy. Coordinate all Air Force frequency requirements on a Navy installation with the appro-
   priate Navy frequency coordinator prior to submission. Refer to AFMAN 33-120 for the appropriate
   Navy AFC and their corresponding AOR.
24                                                     AFI33-118_341SWSUP_I 1 NOVEMBER 2007


     3.5.7. Canadian border. Coordination prior to assigning frequencies is required with Canada within
     80 kilometers (approximately) of the US/Canadian border for terrestrial communications require-
     ments and 250 nautical miles for aeronautical communications requirements. The NTIA coordinates
     the frequency proposal requirements with Canada. Refer to the NTIA Manual for specific guidance.
     3.5.8. Mexican border. Coordination prior to assigning frequencies is required with Mexico within 75
     kilometers (approximately) of the US/Mexican border for terrestrial communications requirements
     and 250 nautical miles (approximately) for aeronautical communications requirements. The NTIA
     coordinates the necessary requirements with Mexico. Refer to the NTIA Manual for specific guidance
     3.5.9. Outside US&P. MAJCOMs coordinate frequency actions according to theater policies and pro-
     cedures through the appropriate Air Force component command.

3.6. Frequency Application and Approval Channels.
     3.6.1. Air Force Organizations in the US&P.
        3.6.1.1. Installation Spectrum Manager (ISM). The ISM is responsible to the installation com-
        mander for managing all frequency use on the installation. Therefore, all units/organizations
        assigned to the installation submit their frequency application proposals to the ISM. The ISM
        sends these proposals as follows:
            3.6.1.1.1. Submit proposals for host installation units to the host MAJCOM.
            3.6.1.1.2. Submit proposals for tenant units, when the requirement supports the host installa-
            tion mission, to the host MAJCOM (even if the tenant is the sole user of the frequency) with a
            copy to the tenant unit’s MAJCOM.
            3.6.1.1.3. Submit proposals for tenant units, when the requirements are not in support of the
            host installation mission, to the supported unit’s MAJCOM with a copy to the host and tenant
            unit MAJCOMs, e.g., as described below:
                3.6.1.1.3.1. Submit frequency requirements for a HQ ACC maintenance expediter net on
                a HQ AMC installation to HQ ACC with a copy to HQ AMC.
                3.6.1.1.3.2. Submit frequency requirements for a HQ AFMC unit in support of HQ ACC
                on a HQ AMC installation to HQ ACC with a copy to HQ AFMC and HQ AMC.
        3.6.1.2. US-based MAJCOMs send frequency actions in SFAF for their units deploying outside
        the US&P to the Air Force component of the theater unified command. For example, HQ ACC
        sends frequency actions to the Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) for a fighter wing deploying to the
        Pacific Area COCOM, Pacific Command. PACAF, in turn, processes these actions according to
        theater procedures.
        3.6.1.3. Air National Guard (ANG) and Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command (HQ AFRC)
        units will:
            3.6.1.3.1. Submit actions to support day-to-day operations, training requirements, fixed air
            traffic control, and navigational aids at operating bases and permanent training sites, through
            appropriate channels to the ANG Readiness Center (ANGRC) or HQ AFRC, respectively. The
            ANGRC or HQ AFRC sends the actions to AFFMA.
AFI33-118_341SWSUP_I 1 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                 25


          3.6.1.3.2. Submit requests in support of exercise or readiness inspections through the tasking
          agency to AFFMA.
          3.6.1.3.3. The ANG units submit actions to support state-levied mission requirements through
          appropriate channels to HQ ANG. The Adjutant General sends them according to state direc-
          tives, to the FCC Safety and Special Radio Services Bureau.
      3.6.1.4. USAF Military Affiliate Radio System (MARS) activities:
          3.6.1.4.1. Submit actions for MARS VHF nets on a military installation or on outlying loca-
          tions hosted by an installation through the host-installation spectrum manager to the host
          MAJCOM. MAJCOMs coordinate with the Chief, USAF MARS (HQ AFCA/ECFP, 203 W.
          Losey St., Room 3100, Scott AFB IL 62225-5222) to ensure the net is authorized before send-
          ing the action to AFFMA.
          3.6.1.4.2. Civilian affiliate stations send frequency actions to the state MARS director. The
          state MARS director sends actions to the region communications manager, who, in turn, sends
          it to the Chief, USAF MARS (HQ AFCA/ECFP). If approved, the Chief, USAF MARS sends
          the frequency action to AFFMA.
          3.6.1.4.3. The Chief, USAF MARS and AFFMA coordinate high frequency (HF) actions. HF
          assignments are made on a regional basis. The authority for station operation is AFI 33-106.
          No formal action is required.
      3.6.1.5. Civil Air Patrol (CAP). The CAP is an auxiliary of the Air Force under Title 10, U.S.C.,
      Armed Forces, Chapter 909, Civil Air Patrol. AFI 10-2701, Organization and Function of the
      Civil Air Patrol, outlines Air Force support to the CAP. CAP units submit frequency actions that
      support Air Force operations and training, whether in whole or in part, to CAP National Headquar-
      ters (CAP-DOKF), 105 South Hansell Street, Maxwell AFB AL 36112-6332. CAP National
      Headquarters sends the frequency actions to Headquarters Air Education and Training Command
      (HQ AETC CSS/SCYC), 61 Main Circle, Suite 3, Randolph AFB TX 78150- 4546, who in turn,
      sends them to AFFMA.
          3.6.1.5.1. AFFMA may assign CAP frequencies for Air Force units to communicate with the
          CAP during operational missions.
          3.6.1.5.2. Air Force units may allow CAP to use their assigned frequencies to communicate
          with other Air Force units during operational missions.
          3.6.1.5.3. CAP units give the ISM a list of frequencies used on the installation. A number of
          these should appear in the installation data pull.
   3.6.2. Air Force Organizations outside the US&P. Overseas units submit frequency requests accord-
   ing to unified command policy. The regional COCOM is responsible for military use of frequencies
   within the command’s geographical area.

3.7. Contractor Use of Frequencies.
   3.7.1. Air Force Contracts. Contractors must submit frequency requests in direct support of Air Force
   contracts through the Air Force representative (normally the ISM if on an Air Force base or if at an
   Acquisition Center, the Program Office responsible for the contract), to the MAJCOM responsible for
26                                                     AFI33-118_341SWSUP_I 1 NOVEMBER 2007


     administering the contract. The contractor must obtain frequency assignments from the FCC for
     requirements not in direct support of the contract.
     3.7.2. Multiple Service Contracts. Contractors must submit frequency requests in support of a multi-
     ple service contract through the appropriate SMO channels to the military department that is the exec-
     utive service for the contract. The contractor must obtain frequency assignments from the FCC for
     requirements not in direct support of the contract.
     3.7.3. Foreign Military Sales, Direct Commercial Sales, and Hybrid programs. If the intention is to
     radiate within the US&P, you must go through the US&P process (e.g., certification and assignment).
     However, Hybrid programs will be handled case-by-case.

3.8. Shared-Use Facilities. Users submit frequency requests for shared-use facilities through the electro-
magnetic spectrum management channels of the agency that maintains the equipment.

3.9. Frequency Review Program. The purpose of the Frequency Review Program is to ensure the GMF
and FRRS accurately reflect current operations. Users submit reviews NLT 90 days before the date shown
in SFAF Item 142 to ensure the frequency assignment is updated and current by the review date. During
the review process, the ISM, with cooperation of the user, will verify the frequency is in use and still
required to meet mission requirements. In addition, the ISM reviews all the technical parameters of the
assignment, for accuracy of information.

3.10. Nonlicensed Devices. A nonlicensed device is a low power intentional, unintentional or incidental
radiator or device that meets the technical specifications prescribed in FCC CFR, Title 47, Part 15 or the
NTIA Manual Annex K. Nonlicensed devices are afforded no protection from interference; if interference
is caused to an authorized service, the nonlicensed device must cease operation. Because of this, Air
Force activities must exercise caution in procuring and using nonlicensed devices. Examples of nonli-
censed devices are wireless local area networks, wireless microphones, and cordless telephones. Using
activities will not use nonlicensed devices for critical command and control applications essential for mis-
sion success, protection of human life or high value assets.

3.11. Frequencies Not Requiring Specific Assignment. International distress and emergency frequen-
cies do not need specific assignments for use. AFMAN 33-120 lists these and other frequencies not
requiring assignment for use in the US&P. Outside the US&P, theater commanders and host nations
determine frequencies that do not need specific assignment.

3.12. Emergency Frequency-Sharing Notification. Under emergency conditions, several government
agencies (i.e., Federal Emergency Management Agency operations) may operate on, or near, frequencies
assigned to Air Force organizations. When this occurs, one of the involved agencies should coordinate
with the affected Air Force organization to arrange frequency sharing during the emergency. Air Force
units will cooperate fully during emergencies unless frequency sharing would jeopardize mission-essen-
tial operations. To properly coordinate at the national level, a representative for the local Air Force units
must up-channel the information concerning the emergency situation. Ideally, this information should
flow through command channels to notify AFFMA. If this is not possible, then pass the information
directly:
     3.12.1. During normal duty hours contact AFFMA at commercial 703-428-1503/44 or DSN
     328-1503/44.
AFI33-118_341SWSUP_I 1 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                    27


   3.12.2. During non-duty hours notify the parent MAJCOM, who in turn will inform AFFMA.

3.13. Air Force Spectrum Interference Resolution (AFSIR) Program. Electromagnetic Interference
(EMI) is any electromagnetic disturbance that interrupts, obstructs, or otherwise degrades or limits the
effective performance of electronics and electrical equipment. It can be induced intentionally, as in some
forms of electronic warfare, or unintentionally, as a result of spurious emissions and responses, intermod-
ulation products, and the like. The AFSIR program, as discussed in AFI 10-707, contains guidance for Air
Force units experiencing EMI that must be resolved on a case-by-case basis.
   3.13.1. (Added-341SW) Using organizations affected by an EMI should begin an immediate investi-
   gation by accomplishing the actions as identified in AFI 10-707, paras 3 and 5.6.11, Electromagnetic
   Interference (EMI) Resolution and AFSPCSUP1, para 3.1.7. If resolution is not obtained in accor-
   dance with noted paragraphs, the using organizations should request assistance from, and assist, the
   ISM in gathering the required information for the initial EMI report. See AFI 10-707, Attachment 2.
   3.13.2. (Added-341SW) The ISM follows AFI 10-707_AFSPCSUP1, para 3.1.7, when submitting
   an EMI report.

                                   SYSTEMS/SERVICE GUIDANCE

4.1. Electronic Fuzes. Installation commanders set local coordination procedures for installation and
tenant activities that develop, design, or use electronic fuzes. Electronic fuzes that activate detonation
devices do not require a DD Form 1494. Units that develop, design, or use electronic fuzes must:
     4.1.1. Research, determine, and evaluate existing frequency assignments for compatibility with the
     intended electromagnetic environment.
     4.1.2. Contact the applicable spectrum managers (MAJCOM or DOD AFC) to select fuze frequen-
     cies.
     4.1.3. Limit fuze-triggering transmitter emissions to the narrowest bandwidth possible.
     4.1.4. Reduce the level of unnecessary emissions.
     4.1.5. Use equipment tunable on more than one frequency.
     4.1.6. Provide protection from accidental triggering by other RF emissions through coding, improv-
     ing receiver selectivity, shielding components, or other techniques.

4.2. Federal and FCC Non-Licensed Devices.
     4.2.1. Non-licensed devices operating in the US&P must conform to the FCC rules or the technical
     criteria in the NTIA Manual. These devices include, but are not limited to: wireless local area net-
     works, wireless barcode readers, bio-medical telemetry, and cordless telephones. Air Force activities
     will not, without prior written permission from the Communications Squadron commander, use
     non-licensed equipment for critical tactical or strategic command and control applications essential
     for mission success, protection of human life, or protection of high-value assets, as they offer no pro-
     tection of spectrum use in support of operational requirements.
        4.2.1.1. This equipment must accept interference from any federal, non-federal, or civilian elec-
        tronic system, non-licensed device, or industrial, scientific, and medical application.
        4.2.1.2. Air Force activities operating a non-licensed device that causes interference to an autho-
        rized radio service shall promptly take steps to eliminate the interference.
        4.2.1.3. Upon notification by cognizant spectrum management personnel that the device is caus-
        ing interference, the operator of the non-licensed device shall cease all radiation from the device
        until the interference is eliminated.
        4.2.1.4. Non-licensed devices subject to FCC certification, notification, or verification shall bear
        the appropriate FCC statement of limitations to operations.
        4.2.1.5. Users will not modify, modernize, enhance, or change the equipment’s power, antenna,
        waveform, or information transfer characteristics in any manner that would cause it to violate the
        NTIA criteria for non-licensed devices or the device’s FCC type certification.
     4.2.2. International. US non-licensed devices require host nation approval to operate. These devices
     include but are not limited to; wireless local area networks, wireless barcode readers, biomedical
     telemetry, and cordless telephones.
AFI33-118_341SWSUP_I 1 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                 29


   4.2.3. US&P Operations. Non-licensed devices operating within the US&P do not require a DD Form
   1494 and may be operated officially without a NTIA approved frequency assignment; however, DOD
   requires a frequency assignment registered in the FRRS. This is accomplished through the local spec-
   trum management office.
   4.2.4. Outside US&P Operations. Theater commanders and host nations decide if frequency support
   is available and the requirements for frequency assignments. Users must submit a DD Form 1494
   through the supporting spectrum manager for equipment that intentionally radiates and will be
   deployed outside the US&P. After obtaining favorable host nation guidance, users may request fre-
   quency assignment.

4.3. Commercial Satellite Use. All satellite terminals capable of accessing commercial satellites in the
Fixed Satellite Service must comply with the CFR Title 47, Part 25, Satellite Communications. Submit
proof of Part 25 compliance as part of the DD Form 1494 package through frequency management chan-
nels to the AFFMA. Request required frequency assignments once the NTIA and the FCC have granted
support. Refer to AFMAN 33-120 for additional information.

4.4. Spacecraft and Balloon Systems. Spacecraft and balloon systems developed or operated by the Air
Force must be capable of on and off control of emissions by telecommand.

4.5. Narrowband Operations. The NTIA mandated narrowband channelization for frequency bands
138-150.8, 162-174, and 406.1-420 MHz. In the US&P, all Air Force-owned or leased LMR equipment
operating in the US&P must be narrowband capable by the following dates:
   4.5.1. All systems in the 162-174 MHz band must be narrowband compliant by 1 January 2005,
   according to the NTIA Manual. Anyone not narrowband compliant will operate on a non-interference
   basis (NIB) to all other narrowband users.
   4.5.2. All systems in the 138-144, 148-150.8 and 406.1-420 MHz bands must be narrowband compli-
   ant by 1 January 2008, according to the NTIA Manual. Anyone not narrowband compliant will be
   NIB to all other narrowband users.
   4.5.3. All LMR systems in the 380-399.9 MHz band will operate in a narrowband standard.

4.6. Trunked Land Mobile Radio (TLMR) Systems. All TLMR systems require SPS approval prior to
the application for frequency assignment. Installation of a TLMR requires consolidation of all TLMR
nets. Federal agencies managing TLMRs shall allow access by other federal agencies where such access
is technically and operationally feasible. All TLMR proposal requests for operation in the US&P must
include a current SPS and IRAC docket number. Delete wideband frequencies as you receive approval for
the new narrowband frequencies.

4.7. Receive-Only Systems. Although these systems do not require USMCEB allocations, submit a DD
Form 1494 to:
   4.7.1. Provide interference protection, update the SXXI, and conduct EMC studies.
   4.7.2. Process coordination contours for the NTIA Manual for operational (Stage 4) receive-only sat-
   ellite communications terminals.
30                                                     AFI33-118_341SWSUP_I 1 NOVEMBER 2007


4.8. Commercial Antennas on Federal Property. Commercial vendors may request the installation of
commercial antennas on Air Force property. To ensure no adverse impacts to DOD systems, commanders
and/or agency directors shall coordinate requests through the Base Communications-Electronic (C-E)
Real Property Office for the placement of new telecommunications services on Air Force property. The
vendor will provide information to JSC for an electromagnetic interference radiation hazard analysis at
his or her own expense. The ISM may facilitate in these procedures. Refer to AFI 32-9003, Granting Tem-
porary Use of Air Force Real Property, for additional information (https://private.afca.af.mil/pwcs).

4.9. Built-In Test Equipment. This equipment does not require a DD Form 1494 unless it exceeds the
technical criteria in the NTIA Manual or if the intended use is outside the US&P. Frequency assignments
are required for built-in test equipment.

4.10. Family Radio Service (FRS). Air Force entities are authorized to purchase and operate radios cer-
tified by the FCC in the FRS, pursuant to Part 95, Subpart B of the FCC Rules and Regulations (Title 47,
Code of Federal Regulations). Air Force users will be accorded the same privileges as non-federal users.
Because FRS users must share each channel and no user is assured protection from interference caused by
another authorized user. User assumes those limitations when this equipment is purchased and operated.
Air Force entities may not purchase and operate FRS radios for planned communications operations that
safeguard human life or property. No license or frequency assignment is required or can be obtained in the
US&P. Possession and use of FRS radios outside the US&P is subject to host country and international
regulations. Air Force FRS users must comply with the following conditions:
     4.10.1. Find regulations governing the use of FRS in CFR, Title 47, Part 95, Subpart 95.191, Eligibil-
     ity and Responsibility; Subpart 95.192, Authorized Locations; Subpart 95.193, Types of Communica-
     tions; Subpart 95.194, FRS Units.
     4.10.2. Possession of FRS devices outside the US&P is subject to host country and international reg-
     ulations. Air Force members or employees are not authorized to use FRS radios outside the US&P
     without host nation approval. Unified command directives apply. Coordinate FRS use with the appro-
     priate Air Force component spectrum management office.
     4.10.3. Air Force members and employee users are responsible for all communications using FRS
     radio equipment. Use must comply with federal, state, and local law.
     4.10.4. The installation commander may prohibit FRS when interference to mission essential electro-
     magnetic equipment is anticipated or to resolve a suspected RFI problem.
     4.10.5. Air Force members and employees using FRS radios must relinquish channel use for emer-
     gency communication messages concerning the immediate safety of life or the immediate protection
     of property.
     4.10.6. Use only FCC-certified FRS. Any modification to the equipment to boost power, add a differ-
     ent antenna, or to increase the gain of the current antenna, cancels the FCC certification and voids
     authority. Illegal FRS equipment is subject to confiscation.
     4.10.7. FRS devices are not authorized for classified, sensitive but unclassified, command and con-
     trol, squadron operational, aircraft/flight line maintenance, fire crash, explosive ordinance disposal,
     security forces, emergency/disaster response, tactical or training operations, and/or medical commu-
     nications.
AFI33-118_341SWSUP_I 1 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                      31


   4.10.8. Under no circumstance will FRS radios be permitted for use in controlled areas without
   express written consent of the installation commander and full compliance with all security directives.
   4.10.9. Use of FRS cannot be protected from harmful interference. FRS radios may not cause inter-
   ference to any licensed device and must accept all interference from licensed devices.
   4.10.10. The FCC may restrict use of the FRS radios if the station is located within the National
   Radio Quiet Zone (areas of MD, VA, and WV bounded by 39°15’N 78°30’W, 39°15’N 80°30’W,
   37°30’N 78°30’W, 37°30’N 80°30’W).
   4.10.11. Air Force members and employees who belong to non-appropriated fund activities and some
   appropriated fund activities may use FRS radios, as follows: To communicate with non-government
   users during Air Force supported or sponsored community activities, i.e., scouts, Special Olympics,
   youth activities/sporting events, civil disasters, funeral details for deceased military veterans, etc. In
   addition, FRS radios may be used for administrative purposes when communicating in warehouses,
   commissaries, base exchanges, billeting areas, work crews, etc. FRS radios may also be used on Air
   Force installations where the public is permitted entrance and in family housing areas.

4.11. Inter-Squad Radio (ISR). The ISR is the military FRS radio operating in the 380 - 399.975 MHz
sub-band. The ISR is the military FRS radio and is recommended over the commercial FRS for Air Force
members and employees. Because it is in the government RF band and the potential for RF interference is
less, ISRs can be used to transmit information determined by the Designated Approving Authority to be
publicly releasable. Unless appropriately encrypted, ISRs cannot be used to transmit classified, sensitive,
command and control, fire/crash, security, and/or emergency response/medical communications. Refer to
AFI 33-201, Communications Security, for guidance on protecting these types of communication.
   4.11.1. Do not modify the ISR.
   4.11.2. Only Air Force members, employees, and contractors providing support to military opera-
   tions will use the ISR.
   4.11.3. Do not use the ISR for personal use.
   4.11.4. Possession of ISR devices outside the US&P is subject to host country and international reg-
   ulations. Air Force members, employees, or contractors are not authorized to use ISR devices outside
   the US&P without host nation approval. Unified command directives apply. Coordinate ISR use with
   the appropriate Air Force component spectrum management office. Additional restrictions may be
   imposed in different AORs (i.e., Tactical and Training LMRs require NSA type 1 encryption).

4.12. General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS). The GMRS is a personal two-way voice communica-
tions service used to facilitate the activities of an individual and their immediate family. GMRS cannot be
used by government agencies under any circumstances. Title 47, U.S.C. Part 95 provides regulatory guid-
ance.

4.13. International Maritime Satellite (Inmarsat™). Inmarsat™ is a commercial satellite system sub-
ject to international law and treaty and can only be used for peaceful purposes. Inmarsat™ uses a satellite
link to interface with terrestrial telephone systems or other Inmarsat™ terminals. Neither spectrum certi-
fication nor frequency assignments are required; however, special procedures exist for the purchase and
use of Inmarsat™ terminals. Users must contact HQ AFCA/ECWM, through command channels, for
guidance. Obtain additional information at https://private.afca.af.mil.mss/Inmarsat.htm
32                                                   AFI33-118_341SWSUP_I 1 NOVEMBER 2007


4.14. Leased Services. Refer to AFMAN 33-120.

4.15. Electronic Warfare (EW). The EW operations can be airborne, ground, or both. There are no fre-
quency bands allocated for EW training operations. Therefore, special procedures have been established
for coordinating and using FCC and FAA controlled frequency bands. Submit frequency clearance
requests for electronic attack (EA) operations outside the US&P and Canada according to theater policies
and procedures.
     4.15.1. Submit airborne clearance requests for use in US&P and Canada through Air Force channels
     to AFFMA according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual (CJCSM) 3212.02B, Perform-
     ing Electronic Attack in the United States and Canada for Tests, Training and Exercises.
     4.15.2. Ground threat simulators. Submit frequency assignment actions according to AFMAN 33-120
     and USMCEB PUB 7.

4.16. Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS). COTS devices must remain unmodified as procured to main-
tain the definition. Paragraph 2.4.18. identifies COTS exempt from frequency process. Process all others
through the normal DOD spectrum approval process. DOD requires a frequency assignment registered in
the FRRS.

4.17. Joint Tactical Information Distribution System/Multifunctional Information Distribution
System (JTIDS/MIDS). JTIDS/MIDS, a communication component of Link 16, is a secure, jam-resis-
tant, tactical, radio navigation and communications system that uses the JTIDS/MIDS terminal as its com-
munications component. It operates in the 960-1215 MHz band over 51 frequencies with the
Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) 1030 and 1090 MHz RF bands notched.
     4.17.1. Frequency assignments and operations must be in strict adherence with Chairman of the Joint
     Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 6232.01B, LINK-16 Spectrum Deconfliction within the United
     States and Possessions, and the Joint Spectrum Users Guide located on the HQ ACC web site at
     https://totn.acc.af.mil or https://totn.acc.af.mil/3_Jtids/Documents/6232-01b.pdf.
     4.17.2. Due to increased reliance on this portion of the spectrum, the DOD and the Department of
     Transportation (DOT) entered into a MOA to protect continued use of this vital spectrum. Details of
     the MOA are at Attachment 3.

without causing or suffering unacceptable degradation due to unintentional EMI to or from other
equipment in the same environment. (NTIA) (2) DOD: The ability of systems, equipment, and devices
that utilize the electromagnetic spectrum to operate in their intended operational environments without
suffering unacceptable degradation or causing unintentional degradation because of electromagnetic
radiation or response. It involves the application of sound electromagnetic spectrum management;
system, equipment, and device design configuration that ensures interference-free operation; and clear
concepts and doctrines that maximize operational effectiveness. (Joint Publication [JP] 1-02).
Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)—Any electromagnetic disturbance that interrupts, obstructs, or
otherwise degrades or limits the effective performance of electronics or electrical equipment. It can be
induced intentionally, as in some forms of electronic warfare, or unintentionally, as a result of spurious
emissions and responses, intermodulation products, and the like.
Foreign Disclosure—The approval to release technical information from the DD Form 1494.
Frequency Assignment—The authorization given by an administration for a radio station to use a radio
frequency or radio frequency channel under specified conditions. (RR)
Frequency Assignment, Group—A frequency assignment made only to terrestrial stations and provides
authority to operate but does not represent continuing operations, or provide an assignment for planning
purposes. (3.2.4.) (NTIA)
Frequency Assignment, Temporary—A frequency assignment for a specified period of time, more than
90 days but less than five years. Temporary assignments will have a SFAF item 141 (Expiration date), but
may be renewed for additional periods, if necessary. Coordinate this type of assignment at the national
level and submit to the FAS for approval and recommendation to the NTIA for assignment. The
assignment is entered into the Government Master File (GMF) with an appropriate expiration date. Air

Force users may apply for a short-term, limited, temporary assignment up to 90 days. This type of
short-term, temporary assignment is not entered into the GMF. Short-term, temporary assignments are
renewable up to a total of 180 days from the initial date of assignment. Limit short-term, temporary
assignments to urgent requirements (i.e., exercises, contingencies, short training periods, or to test/
evaluate experimental equipment). (NTIA)
Frequency Coordination—The process of obtaining approval to use the radio frequency spectrum via
arrangements and technical liaison for the purpose of minimizing harmful interference through
cooperative use of the radio frequency spectrum. To be effective, the coordination must extend through
the planning, proposal, and actual in use phases of radio frequency utilization.
Harmful Interference—Interference that endangers the functioning of a radio navigation service or of
other services, or seriously degrades, obstructs, or repeatedly interrupts a radio communications service
operating in accordance with the ITU Radio Regulations. (RR)

                                              Attachment 2

                  FREQUENCY ASSIGNMENT CLASSIFICATION REFERENCE

A2.1. Security Classification. This attachment is a reference used for Air Force specific frequency
assignment requirements. As a reference it explains the handling and retention of the classification of fre-
quency assignments, whereas the DOD 5200.1R and AFI 31-401 are general in nature. This attachment is
reference only and is not to be used as a classification source.
     A2.1.1. Primarily the association with the function they support determines security classification of
     DOD and Federal Government frequency assignments and the information in them. Classify individ-
     ual data items according to DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401.

A2.2. Individual Air Force Frequency Assignments.
     A2.2.1. The following frequency assignment information, standing alone or in combination and not
     associated with any other assignment information, is UNCLASSIFIED. Mark these items as (U) in the
     SFAF.
        A2.2.1.1. Overall classification of the frequency assignment (SFAF Item 005).
        A2.2.1.2. Security classification modification (SFAF Item 006).
        A2.2.1.3. Type of action (SFAF Item 010).
        A2.2.1.4. Agency serial number (SFAF Item 102).
        A2.2.1.5. IRAC docket number (SFAF Item 103).
        A2.2.1.6. List serial number (SFAF Item 105).
        A2.2.1.7. Serial replaced, delete date (SFAF Item 106).
        A2.2.1.8. Docket number of older authorizations (SFAF Item 108).
        A2.2.1.9. Operating frequency or frequency band and excluded frequency or frequency band
        (SFAF Items 110 and 111).
        A2.2.1.10. Agency (SFAF Item 200).
        A2.2.1.11. Command (SFAF Item 204).
        A2.2.1.12. IRAC Notes (SFAF Item 500).
        A2.2.1.13. Frequency action officer (SFAF Item 701).
        A2.2.1.14. Control/request number (SFAF Item 702).
     A2.2.2. Classify other assignment information, standing alone or in combination with other informa-
     tion (including A2.2.1.), according to DOD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 by the appropriate classifica-
     tion authority. Include the appropriate classification marking with the corresponding SFAF item.

A2.3. Lists of Air Force Frequency Assignments.
     A2.3.1. Although most individual frequency assignment records in the Air Force Radio Frequency
     Authorization (RFA) are individually unclassified, classify the total RFA according to the highest
AFI33-118_341SWSUP_I 1 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                     41


   classification level of the assignments it contains. Lists (two or more frequencies) of unclassified fre-
   quency assignment records in a given range of frequencies, or in a given area, can be categorized as
   sensitive, but unclassified because they may provide information leading to the disclosure of military
   or national security-related operations and scientific and technological matters relating to national
   security. These lists can indicate the overall strategic telecommunications capabilities of the US, and
   their disclosure could cause damage to national security. The continued protection of this information
   is essential to national security because it pertains to communications security and reveals vulnerabil-
   ities and capabilities. Its unauthorized disclosure can reasonably be expected to result in nullify-
   ing the effectiveness of telecommunications networks and the capability of the US.
   A2.3.2. The USMCEB-M-019-98 gives guidance on classifying compilations of frequency assign-
   ment records. Based on this guidance:
      A2.3.2.1. Classify RFAs or frequency lists at the highest level of any individual frequency assign-
      ment it contains.
      A2.3.2.2. When RFAs or frequency lists contain the aggregation of UNCLASSIFIED DOD,
      MILDEP, or NSA frequency assignment records, classify it CONFIDENTIAL, except as
      exempted by paragraph A2.5.
      A2.3.2.3. A RFA or frequency list containing only UNCLASSIFIED assignments of one unit or
      location is considered UNCLASSIFIED. For example, to select all records where SFAF data item
      200 (Agency) = USAF would result in a CONFIDENTIAL aggregate list; whereas, select all
      records where SFAF item 301 (Transmitter Location) or 401 (Receiver Location) = Hill would
      result in an UNCLASSIFIED aggregate list. Users that plan to operate in an UNCLASSIFIED
      environment should select from the FRRS only UNCLASSIFIED records applicable to their oper-
      ational requirements.

A2.4. Marking.
   A2.4.1. All DOD frequency assignment material must contain proper warnings/markings, as out-
   lined, whether computer-generated or manually applied. Mark DOD data extracted from frequency
   assignment databases with one of the following warning statements, depending upon which category
   is applicable.
   A2.4.2. Mark documents/material containing UNCLASSIFIED frequency assignment records/data
   classified CONFIDENTIAL under Section 3 of the USMCEB-M-019-98 CONFIDENTIAL and carry
   markings according to existing DOD security regulations and AFI 31-401. For example:
   Derived From: DOD Frequency Assignment Security Classification Guide

           MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
                     BETWEEN
            DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND
          DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
     REGARDING THE 960-1215 MHZ FREQUENCY BAND
AFI33-118_341SWSUP_I 1 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                         45


                                                 Appendix A


RECOGNIZING:
Treaties of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) fully recognize the sovereign right of each
State to regulate its telecommunications including all transmissions, emissions, and receptions of radio
frequency signals subject to that State’s jurisdiction.
Customary international law and bilateral and multilateral international agreements recognize that mili-
tary aircraft, vessels and spectrum-dependent systems are treated differently from civil and commercial
aircraft, vessels and spectrum-dependent systems. For example, the 1944 Convention on International
Civil Aviation states expressly in Article 3 that it shall be applicable only to civil aircraft and shall not be
applicable to state aircraft.
The 960-1215 MHz band is allocated by the Radio Regulations for Aeronautical Radionavigation Service
(ARNS) and Radionavigation Satellite Service (RNSS) systems, and the development of electronic aids to
navigation.
The Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS), the Multifunctional Information Distribu-
tion System (MIDS), and other similar systems are critical to Department of Defense (DoD) missions
associated with command and control and radionavigation.
FAA and DoD systems dependent upon the 960-1215 MHz spectrum must be coordinated to assure mutu-
als spectrum access.
APPLICABILITY:
This agreement applies to MIDS terminals including MIDS Low Volume Terminal (LVT) variants
(LVT-l, LVT-2. and LVT-3/Fighter Data Link); Integrated Communications Navigation and Identifica-
tion Avionics (ICNIA); ITIDS terminals including ITIDS Class 1, Class 2, Class 2M, and Class 2H; and
future systems incorporating the JTIDS/lMIDS waveform implementation (e.g., the Joint Tactical Radio
System). For the purposes of this agreement, all these systems will be collectively referred to as
“Link-16.”
SPECIFICATIONS:
1. DoT and DoD will support appropriate service allocation and station class designations for systems
meeting the minimum technical/regulatory requirements as specified by the NTIA and international spec-
trum usage agreements. Both agencies will work cooperatively to protect civil and military systems shar-
ing the 960-1215 MHz.
2. DoD will limit uncoordinated Link-16 operations in accordance with the spectrum restrictions outlined
in the NTIA Spectrum Certification as approved by the NTIA Office of Spectrum Management (OSM).
Associate Administrator. Relaxation of these restrictions in the 1030-1215 MHz band on a system-by-sys-
tem, case-by-case, or other appropriate basis may be approved

based on Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) review of testing/documentation that con-
cludes relaxation will not result in harmful interference to authorized users of the band.1
3. Upon final certification approval, DoT will support a permanent United States and its Possessions
(US&P) assignment for Link-16 operations within the constraints identified in the NTIA spectrum certifi-
cation.
4. DoD will ensure that by 2020, all Link-16 terminals are capable of remapping frequencies from below
1030 MHz to the sub-band above 1030 MHz. Any Link-I6 terminal produced after July 1, 2007 will be
capable of remapping. These terminals are expected to begin fielding no later than January 1, 2009. All
fielded Link 16 terminals will incorporate the remapping capability by 2020. Inclusion of the remapping
capability in Link-I6 terminals produced prior to July 1, 2007 (ITIDS terminals excluded) will be handled
when the systems are brought in for depot maintenance and/or are scheduled for other system updates to
the Link-l6 terminal. DoT and DoD will meet annually to review the progress of this effort with the goal
,of ensuring maximum compatibility between Link 16 and aviation systems. DoD will utilize this capabil-
ity as required within the US&P to prevent harmful interference to aviation systems approved by NTIA
via a stage 4 spectrum support certification for operation in the 960-1215 MHz band and implemented
below 1030 MHz. This capability will be utilized to remap the minimum number of frequencies required
to preclude harmful interference based on approval by NTIA through the SPS process. DoD will not use
the requirement to remap frequencies from the Link-16 “hopset” as a rationale for objecting to such avia-
tion systems.
5. DoT will work with the NTIA and other Federal Agencies to ensure aviation systems subject to US
Government regulation using frequencies above 1030 MHz (including Galileo, Global Positioning Sys-
tem (GPS) L52, and other systems with global availability) will be designed to satisfy their minimum per-
formance standards in their intended electromagnetic environment, including Link-16 operations
complying with conditions and restrictions reflected in the Link-16 NTIA spectrum certification or any
subsequent certifications. DoT will also work with the Department of State, the Federal Communications
Commission, the NTIA, and DoD to support the US Government’s efforts to ensure aviation systems not
under US jurisdiction whose receivers may operate in the US&P (including Galileo and other systems
with global availability) will be designed to the same standard outlined in the preceding text.
6. DoT will ensure that future aeronautical radionavigation systems, electronic aids to air navigation, or
other systems subject to its jurisdiction that are to be implemented using spectrum
__________________________________
1 Such relaxations might include higher Time Slot Duty Factor (TSDF) (in excess of 100%) and reduced geographic areas (less than 100 nm).

2 In the event that the mitigation strategies defined in the Interagency GPS Executive Board (IGEB) “Implementation of a Third Civil GPS
Signal” Final Report should prove insufficient to protect civil use of the GPS L5 signal, the option to require remapping Link-16 carriers in
the 1164-1188 MHz band in lieu of a like number of below-1030 MHz Link- 16 carriers (the total number of frequencies remapped to accom-
modate DoT systems shall not exceed 14) will be retained. Studies to support such an option will be developed within the Spectrum Planning
Subcommittee and approved by NTIA. Conclusion of this agreement satisfies the intent of the IGEB Final Report, which states “The DoD
will include a priced option in the full-rate production MIDS request for proposal (RFP) to remap up to seven selectable. contiguous MIDS
frequencies in the 960-1215 MHz band.”

in the 1030-1215 MHz band will be designed to satisfy their minimum performance standards in their
intended electromagnetic environment, including Link-16 systems operating in conformance with the
approved IRAC spectrum certification. DoT will also ensure future aeronautical radionavigation systems
approved by NTIA via a stage 4 spectrum support certification for operation in the 960-1215 MHz band
and implemented below 1030 MHz will take into account Link-16 operations within the constraints of the
NTIA spectrum certification or any subsequent spectrum certifications on Link-16 frequencies not subject
to remapping.
7. DoT will authorize operations exceeding the terms of this agreement on a case-by-case basis. DoT and
DOD will develop coordination procedures to accommodate Link-16 training exercises involving
51-channel operations, operations exceeding approved spectrum certification criteria, and operations
involving non-US and new Link-16 terminals/platforms.
8. DoT and DoD will develop 51-channel coordination procedures regionally, taking into account the
expected aviation system density and services and the DoD operating areas in that geographic location.3
9. DoT will not require compatibility between Link-l 6 and Universal Access Transceiver (UAT) receiv-
ers on military platforms. UAT transmitters may be required on military platforms.
10. Only those electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) features directly affected by the engineering change
will be subject to re-certification.4 It is expected that the monitoring function can be accomplished by a
suitable revision to the uniform frequency monitor.
11. DoT will not require new EMC testing or additional restrictions with regard to existing ARNS sys-
tems (Mode S, Air Traffic Control Radar Beacon System, Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System,
Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)/N and DMFJP, and/or the 1090 Automatic Dependent Surveil-
lance-Broadcast extended squitter) and RNSS systems (GPS L5 and Galileo) as a result of remapping.
12. DoT will promote the development of robust aviation systems that lend themselves to improved com-
patibility with 51-frequency JTIDS terminals through cooperation with RTCA Inc., industry, and DoD.
13. DoT and DoD will jointly submit to NTIA a recommended specification and methodology to facilitate
the terminal EMC features certification of Link-16 systems operating in the 960-1215 MHz band, within
30 days of the signature of this MOA. Subsequent to NTIA approval of the specification and a successful
demonstration of the implementation of the

specification/methodology DoT will endorse DoD’s certifying all future Link-16 terminals’ compliance,
eliminating the need for future NTIA EMC features demonstrations.
14. DoD and DoT will promote the terms of this agreement in international forums (e.g.,DoD will encour-
age North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other international Link-16 users to implement a
similar, compatible remapping capability, and DoT will work with the International Civil Aviation Orga-
nization (lCAO) and other civil aviation organizations to ensure new systems will recognize that they face
environments in some countries which include Link-16 electromagnetic environments as specified in the
NTIA spectrum certification.
15. DoD and DoT win seek to implement all the terms of this agreement in good faith. If circumstances
change, both DoD and DoT will work together to resolve any disputes. The failure by one Department to
comply with the terms of the agreement may be a basis for the other Department to terminate the agree-
ment.
