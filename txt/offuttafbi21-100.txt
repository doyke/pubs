SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change implements new guidance recommended from previous LCAP Inspection
personnel. This update implements specific flightline clothing procedures.
1. General FOD Policies and Procedures.
     1.1. Operating Locations (OL) will participate in and follow host base FOD programs:
     however, OLs will notify 55th Wing FOD/DOP Monitor of FOD incidents involving 55th
     Wing aircraft.
     1.2. The Wing FOD Monitor will attend pre-construction briefings when pertaining to
     airfield repairs as needed. During airfield pre-construction meetings the chief of the
     construction section, Engineering and Contracts, are responsible for briefing contractors on
     FOD prevention. The construction inspector will inspect construction sites for compliance
     with the FOD prevention program, and will identify potential problems to the contracting
     officer for corrective action.
     1.3. Intake and exhaust plugs/covers will be kept in good condition and only used for their
     designed function. Intake or exhaust plugs/covers will only be removed when performing
     intake or exhaust inspections/maintenance, when engines are to be operated, or upon crew
     ready time. Due to the extremely corrosive nature of aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF)
     (used in building fire suppression systems) on engines, all aircraft will have inlet covers
     installed at all times when parked in Bldg 457 docks 1-5 and nose docks 9-11. They will
     only be removed to perform maintenance/inspection and will be immediately reinstalled.
     1.4. The ―flight line area‖ is defined as all runways, taxiways, ramps and concrete areas
     attached to them within the entry control point (ECP) perimeter.
     1.5. General FOD prevention awareness briefings will be provided during maintenance
     orientation courses conducted by 55 MOS/MXOT. Work center specific FOD training will
     be provided to all personnel within 30 days of arrival and at least annually thereafter. Work
     center supervisors will indoctrinate all assigned personnel on the importance of the FOD
     Prevention Program and ensure personnel are familiar with the policies and procedures
     contained in this instruction. All personnel will be briefed on the dangers associated with
     aircraft and engine intakes prior to operation.
     1.6. Vehicle foreign object (FO) containers will be secured at all times to prevent tipping
     over. Vehicle operators will ensure their vehicle is kept FO free at all times to include low
     speed vehicles. FO inspections shall be accomplished as part of the vehicle daily inspection
     and prior to use of the vehicle by any operator.
     1.7. All motorized vehicles or support equipment are required to stop at each FOD check
     point and perform a ―Roll Over‖ FO check. Additionally, any vehicle leaving the finished
     surface will perform a ―Roll Over‖ FO check immediately upon returning to the finished
     surface. Vehicle engines will be shut off and parking brakes will be set during tire FOD
     checks, unless a qualified driver remains in the driver’s seat. Emergency vehicles are exempt
     from performing the ―Roll Over‖ FO check, if directly responding to an emergency situation.
     1.8. No glass drink containers will be carried on the flight line or in vehicles on the flight
     line. All empty containers will be placed in FOD cans.
OFFUTTAFB21-100 13 APRIL 2010                                                                 3


   1.9. Consumables such as screws, bolts, washers, cotter pins, etc. will be placed in screw
   bags or zip lock bags when taken to work areas. Loose hardware will not be carried in tool
   bags or in individual’s pockets.
      1.9.1. When an aircraft part or panel has been removed, a parts bag will be used to
      control the consumables. The parts bag will be annotated with the number and type of
      items it contains as well as the applicable part or panel it is associated with.
   1.10. FO containers will be available when maintenance is performed on aircraft. FOD
   pouches/bags contained within a Composite Tool Kit (CTK) will be considered suitable for
   filling this requirement.
   1.11. Work areas will be thoroughly policed for FO as soon as each job is completed and
   when an item is dropped or misplaced.
   1.12. Hats will not be worn on the flight line, except winter caps during inclement/cold
   weather; however, every effort should be made to prevent such headgear from coming loose.
   During special events such as ceremonies, festivals, DV arrivals and departures hats are
   authorized provided they are not worn within 50 feet of operating aircraft.
   1.13. Security Forces, while performing official duties, may wear the beret with insignia
   attached; however, when they are within 50 feet of an operating aircraft their berets must be
   removed and secured. Berets with metal insignias will not be worn on the airfield.
   1.14. All personnel entering the flight line, with exception to those greeting DV’s, will
   remove metal insignias/badges, (to include all combinations with the uniform i.e. ribbons,
   skill level badge, name tag, and US insignias) metal hair fasteners, earrings, or any jewelry
   that may fall off without notice.
   1.15. The USAF Restricted Area Badge and other badges will be secured to uniform with a
   nylon or cotton cord. If a metal clip is used, it must be attached securely to badge.
   1.16. Personal bags such as back packs and helmet bags that are used on the flightline must
   not have anything loosely attached to them. Items that can be dislodged easily must be
   removed or permanently attached.
2. FOD Reporting.
   2.1. In the event of a suspected or confirmed FOD incident, report IAW the following
   procedures:
      2.1.1. The individual discovering the damage will:
          2.1.1.1. Notify the Maintenance Operations Center (55 MOS/MOC) immediately
          upon discovery.
          2.1.1.2. Complete a ACC FOD report which will be provided by the 55th Wing FOD
          Monitor.
      2.1.2. Aircrews will complete an Offutt Air Force Base (OAFB) Form 3404, Aircraft
      Incident/BASH/Engine Shutdown Worksheet, during the debrief process.
          2.1.2.1. Debrief Section will forward worksheet to 55 WG/SEF, 55 MXG/QA and 55
          MOS/MOC.

        2.1.4. The wing FOD Monitor will:
            2.1.4.1. Conduct an investigation IAW AFI 21-101 and AFI 21-101 CAF SUP1 to
            determine if the incident was a preventable or non-preventable FOD incident. Results
            of the investigation will be briefed to the 55 WG/CV.
            2.1.4.2. Report the incident to HQ ACC/A4MP as soon as damage is known but no

     day. Supervisors will ensure personnel are spaced apart to provide complete coverage of the
     area (no more than 10 feet apart), and personnel are not dismissed until area is FO free.
     Close attention will be paid to expansion joints, seams, and grounding points for small
     stones, deteriorating concrete, loose tar, and hardware during all FOD walks/inspections.
