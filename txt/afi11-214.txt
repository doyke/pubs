and airborne weapons systems. Operation Plans (OPLANs) and Operation Orders (OPORDs)
will provide the foundation for this coordination.
     2.2.1. Coordinate missions flown with other commands, services, and foreign nation services
     in advance. In the event of conflicting guidance, apply the most restrictive guidance
     (Training Rules (TRs), operating instructions, etc.) of participating units.
2.3. General Aircrew, ABM, WD, ASOC, and JTAC Responsibilities.
     2.3.1. Use the procedures described in Mission Design Series (MDS)-specific AFTTP 3-1s
     and 3-3s and applicable Joint Publications.
     2.3.2. Know the capabilities and limitations of communications, control facilities,
     coordination requirements, and other weapons systems employed for mission
     accomplishment.
     2.3.3. For all missions, be knowledgeable of the applicable OPLAN/OPORD, Special
     Instructions (SPINS), Air Operations Directive, Area Air Defense Plan (AADP), Airspace
     Control Plan (ACP), and review the daily Air Tasking Order (ATO), Airspace Control Order
     (ACO), and any other source available affecting the assigned Area of Responsibility (AOR).
     2.3.4. Know the states of alert, readiness, warning, and Rules of Engagement (ROE) within
     the operational command’s assigned AOR.
     2.3.5. Know and comply with authentication procedures.
     2.3.6. Know the characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of the threat.
     2.3.7. Know the tactics described in appropriate tactics manuals.
     2.3.8. Know and comply with theater or region integrated air defense and airspace control
     procedures to include Minimum Risk Route (Safe Passage) procedures, free fire zones,
     recovery airfield status, location of known friendly and enemy Surface-to-Air Missile sites,
     etc.
     2.3.9. Know and comply with local operating procedures and/or TRs.
     2.3.10. As a minimum use Attachment 2 as a guide to coordinate/brief prior to missions.
2.4. Check-in and Check-out Procedures. Aircrew will check-in and check-out with the
controlling agency, such as AWACS, JSTARS, CRC, Forward Air Controller Airborne
(FAC(A)), ASOC or JTAC, with the minimum items described below. Some or all of the
following calls may be omitted as required for Operations Security or Communications Security.
Additionally, specific mission sets may require additional items and should be accomplished in
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                           7

          Feature (IFF/SIF), conduct an IFF/SIF check and advise the aircrew of status
          ―SOUR‖ or ―SWEET.‖
          2.4.1.2.4. Provide a brief to include location of friendly forces, civilians and no fire
          areas.
          2.4.1.2.5. Pass information pertinent to mission accomplishment. Pass the air
          ―PICTURE‖ and surface ―LOWDOWN‖ to include ground order of battle and
          electronic order of battle. Do not pass information already in the ATO/ACO unless it
          requires special emphasis.
              2.4.1.2.5.1. Status of Support Assets. At check-in provide the mission
              commander with ―WORDS‖ on the status of all packages supporting the mission.

                2.4.1.3.2.2. ASOC/FAC(A)/JTAC will provide a read back to the aircrew the
                actual weapons load-out.
            2.4.1.3.3. Mission Update. The control agency (AWACS, CRC) will pass any
            mission updates to include updated target coordinates.
            2.4.1.3.4. Fuel Status. Pass fuel status by indicating the amount of ―PLAYTIME‖ in
            minutes the flight has above "BINGO" fuel.
     2.4.2. Check-out. The type of conflict and theater of operations will determine controlling
     agency priorities for recovering aircraft.
        2.4.2.1. During check-out aircrew will contact the controlling agency with the following:
            2.4.2.1.1. Call sign, location, and recovery base or recovery request.
            2.4.2.1.2. If available for additional Air-to-Air or Air-to-Surface tasking, transmit
            ―PLAYTIME‖ and ordnance remaining.
            2.4.2.1.3. Mission results and intelligence.
        2.4.2.2. The ABM/WD will, as conditions permit:
            2.4.2.2.1. Provide recovery instructions including base status and weather.
            2.4.2.2.2. Copy and relay in-flight reports and/or weather reports.
            2.4.2.2.3. Assist in Minimum Risk Route (Safe Passage) procedures.
2.5. Airspace Control.
     2.5.1. General Information. Effective airspace management and utilization is a shared
     responsibility between aircrew and the controlling agency. During training missions,
     airspace is generally reserved for only those aircraft participating in the training. As aircrew,
     ABMs, WDs, ASOCs, and JTACs transition to combat operations, airspace allocation is
     determined by the ACO, mission priorities, and airspace needs of multiple users.
     2.5.2. Commit Criteria. The commit is a coordinated effort between aircrew, Tactical
     Command and Control’s (TAC C2) ABM/WDs, and the Area Air Defense Commander
     (through the SADO and/or RADC). Authorities, responsibilities, and procedures are
     governed by published OPORDs, OPLANS, command authority, ROE, SPINS, commit
     criteria, and force commander’s directions.
        2.5.2.1. TAC C2 initiates a ―COMMIT‖ when on- or off-board sensors identify the
        adversary has met pre-defined criteria. When informed of a ―COMMIT‖ by TAC C2, the
        flight lead will acknowledge by directing the flight to ―COMMIT‖ or advise TAC C2
        ―NEGATIVE COMMIT‖ and state the reason.
        2.5.2.2. Aircrew initiate a ―COMMIT‖ when on- or off-board sensors identify the
        adversary has met pre-defined criteria. When the aircrew initiates a ―COMMIT‖ the
        flight lead will inform the ABM/WD and provide target information.
     2.5.3. Continuum of Control. The continuum of control is grouped into five levels: close,
     tactical, broadcast, advisory, and autonomous. Transition between levels of control may
     occur rapidly and continuously throughout the mission. The continuum allows maximum use
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                      9


   of aircrew and ABM/WDs’ SA while minimizing missed opportunities. Table 2.1 shows the
   Continuum of Control.

                                                          provided
  Vectors and                     Aircrew responsible for tactical positioning
    altitude

      2.5.3.1. Close Control. The ABM/WD is responsible for vectors, intercept geometry,
      and altitude deconfliction.
      2.5.3.2. Tactical Control. Tactical control enables the maximum use of aircrew and
      ABM/WD radar, communication, and SA to accomplish the mission. It is the standard
      employment level for the execution of operational and training missions and employs
      informative, comparative, and directive communications.
          2.5.3.2.1. Aircrew will structure communications to support SA of all participants.
          Call sign usage is critical to mission success.
          2.5.3.2.2. ABM/WDs will keep aircrew informed about all situations affecting their
          mission or execution through clear and concise communications.
      2.5.3.3. Broadcast Control. Broadcast control is a means for ABM/WDs to support air
      operations in a covert or saturated environment. ABM/WDs provide informative
      communications primarily to pass target information to multiple missions by referencing
      a designated location.
      2.5.3.4. Advisory Control. Advisory control is used when the controlling agency loses
      radar capability. ABM/WDs may use procedural control to manage airspace allocation
      depending on the controller’s training and certification, and published
      procedures/restrictions.
      2.5.3.5. Autonomous Operations. Autonomous operations occur when the aircrew
      cannot receive information or guidance from TAC C2 or the controlling agency. During
      autonomous operations that are not pre-planned, both aircrew and TAC C2/controlling
      agency will attempt to re-establish communications.
      2.5.3.6. Terminal attack control is the authority to control the maneuver of and grant
      weapons release clearance to attacking aircraft. JTACs and FAC(A)s use terminal attack
      control when controlling close air support and other mission types when a JTAC or
      FAC(A) is required.
      2.5.3.7. Procedural Area Control is a method of airspace control for a specific area which
      relies on a combination of orders and procedures. The ASOC provides procedural area
 10                                                               AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012


       control for an area designated in the ACO and typically corresponds with the Division
       Area of Operations.
   2.5.4. Methods of Airspace Control. ABMs, WDs, FAC(A)s, ASOCs, and JTACs use
   positive or procedural methods to control and deconflict airspace between participating
   aircraft, between aircraft and surface fires/missions, and between participating and non-
   participating aircraft.
       2.5.4.1. The method of airspace control is dictated by system capabilities,
       pilot/ABM/WD/ASOC/JTAC training/certification, and requirements published in the
       ACP, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Control (ATC) regulations,
       host nation Aeronautical Information Publications, SPINS, and/or other governing
       documents.
           2.5.4.1.1. Procedural control methods depend on adherence to published procedures
           with real-time changes directed by the controlling agency based on mission
           requirements, weather, and competing/conflicting requirements.
           2.5.4.1.2. Positive control methods rely on radar, other sensors, tactical data links,
           and transponder usage to positively identify, track and direct air assets.
       2.5.4.2. TAC C2 focus for airspace control is safety of all users through the application
       of deconfliction methods. TAC C2 does not provide standard ATC services as defined
       by FAA or host nation rules.
       2.5.4.3. During Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC), aircrew must use all available
       sensors to clear their flight path utilizing see and avoid procedures.
       2.5.4.4. ABM/WD/ASOC/JTACs will use all available radar, data link, and other sensors
       to provide SA to aircraft under their control, and should communicate to aircrew when no
       longer able to provide positive control and deconfliction due to limited radar coverage or
       task saturation.
2.6. Scenario Changes. Before the "FIGHT'S-ON" call (or ―vulnerability‖ start time), exercise
directors, mission commanders, and ABM/WDs will notify and receive acknowledgment from
all aircrew for any scenario changes affecting safety of flight (e.g., airspace changes, weather in
working area, block changes, altimeter setting, etc.).
2.7. Exercises. The following instructions apply to major exercises including, but not limited
to, Flag Exercises, Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI), and composite force training (CFT)
exercises:
   2.7.1. Special Instructions (SPINS). Exercise directors will publish and brief SPINS
   unique to their exercise.
   2.7.2. Qualifications. Commanders will ensure that exercise participation is limited to those
   events that aircrew and ABM/WDs are qualified to perform. Mission Commander and other
   upgrades may be accomplished in a major exercise with appropriate supervision.
   2.7.3. Briefing Requirements. Exercise directors will brief participants unfamiliar with this
   instruction to ensure they know and understand the TRs. For additional Joint Live Fire
   Exercise briefing requirements, refer to Attachment 4. Exercise directors will also publish
   modifications to TRs in the exercise planning document to accommodate differences in TRs.
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                     11


   2.7.4. Pre-Mission Briefings (See paragraph 4.2.1 for additional Air-to-Air TRs briefing
   requirements):
      2.7.4.1. Pre-mission briefings will include the applicable portions of the TRs and
      exercise SPINS.
      2.7.4.2. The mission commander, flight lead, squadron/wing supervisor, or weapons
      officer will conduct daily telephonic mission briefs, e-mail, and/or video teleconference
      with participating units in exercises when operational constraints make it impractical for
      face-to-face briefings. This wing supervisor does not need to be flying in the mission,
      but must be a fully knowledgeable exercise participant.
   2.7.5. Separation of Aircraft. Exercise directors and mission commanders will develop
   and implement deconfliction plans that provide adequate separation of participating aircraft.
   Use any combination of time, space (assigning specific geographical areas to flights), or
   altitude blocks to deconflict participating aircraft.
2.8. General Air-to-Air Refueling Rules.
   2.8.1. ABM/WDs and aircrew will refer to MDS specific checklist, AFI 11-2MDS Volume
   3, AFTTP 3-3.MDS, and Allied Technical Publication (ATP)-56(B), Air to Air Refueling, for
   detailed information with regard to Air-to-Air Refueling.
   2.8.2. Air-to-Air Refueling Communications. Emission control (EMCON) procedures
   must be tailored to receiver and tanker proficiency and flight safety. In addition to the
   guidance provided here, minimized radio transmissions between command and control, the
   receivers, and the tankers will be conducted in accordance with ATP-56(B).

                                 GENERAL TRAINING RULES

3.1. Introduction. This chapter provides general training rules and procedures for day, night,
and low altitude operations.
3.2. G-Awareness Exercise. Conduct all G-awareness exercises IAW AFI 11-2MDS Volume
3, MAJCOM supplements, AFTTP 3-3.MDS, and/or established local procedures.
   3.2.1. As a minimum, conduct a G-awareness exercise:
       3.2.1.1. For aircraft requiring a G-suit, anytime aircrew plan or are likely to maneuver
       above five Gs during the mission.
       3.2.1.2. For aircraft not requiring a G-suit, anytime aircrew plan or are likely to
       maneuver above four Gs during the mission.
   3.2.2. Maintain a minimum of 6,000 feet between aircraft during the G-awareness exercises.
3.3. Single-Ship Operations. [AFSOC guidance] [HELO exempt] Units will fly single-ship
training missions commensurate with expected wartime tasking. This does not restrict units from
flying single-ship missions to meet training requirements (advanced handling, instruments
sorties, red air, etc.). Units will specify fallout and single-ship operations in local operating
instructions.
3.4. Knock-It-Off (KIO) and Terminate Procedures. Use KIO or Terminate procedures to
direct aircraft or aircrew to stop engagements, scenarios and tactical maneuvering.
   3.4.1. KIO Procedures. A KIO call ceases all tactical maneuvering and ends the overall
   scenario. Use KIO procedures for the following:
       3.4.1.1. If safety of flight is a factor.
           3.4.1.1.1. A dangerous situation is developing.
           3.4.1.1.2. An unbriefed or unscheduled flight enters the working area and is
           detrimental to the safe conduct of the mission.
           3.4.1.1.3. Weather below minimums required to safely conduct the scenario.
           3.4.1.1.4. Aircraft malfunctions affecting safety of flight.
           3.4.1.1.5. Loss of SA.
       3.4.1.2. When Desired Learning Objectives (DLOs) either are met or are unattainable for
       an entire scenario.
   3.4.2. Once a "KNOCK-IT-OFF" is called, all participating aircraft will:
       3.4.2.1. Acknowledge with call sign in roll call fashion.
       3.4.2.2. Cease tactical maneuvering and end the scenario.
       3.4.2.3. Deconflict flight paths and climb/descend to a safe altitude, block, or as briefed.
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                      13


      3.4.2.4. Address any problems/issues and obtain verbal clearance from the flight
      lead/mission commander/exercise director/representative before resuming/resetting the
      scenario.
   3.4.3. Terminate procedures. A Terminate ceases all tactical maneuvering with the
   terminating aircraft or within a specific portion of a larger scenario.
      3.4.3.1. Use Terminate procedures when safety of flight is not a factor, and in the
      following cases:
          3.4.3.1.1. Reaching BINGO fuel.
          3.4.3.1.2. DLOs are met or are unattainable for a local engagement within a larger
          scenario.
          3.4.3.1.3. Training rules or other limits met (e.g., 180-degrees turn).
          3.4.3.1.4. Exceeding area boundaries.
          3.4.3.1.5. Below minimum altitude or within minimum range, but when safety is not
          compromised.
          3.4.3.1.6. Below 5,000 feet Above Ground Level (AGL), airspeed is below MDS
          minimum, and within visual range (defined as < 5 NM) of adversary.
      3.4.3.2. Initiate ―TERMINATE‖ procedures with a wing rock or transmit
      "TERMINATE" when conditions are not appropriate for a wing rock (night/weather,
      own-ship parameters will not allow, etc.). When calling ―TERMINATE‖ anchor position
      geographically or with a bullseye reference ("(Callsign), terminate south fight" or
      "(Callsign), terminate fight, BULLSEYE 180/10)‖. Use amplifying information if
      necessary (altitude, type aircraft, and geographical feature).
      3.4.3.3. If ―TERMINATE‖ is called within a large scenario, radio acknowledgments (in
      roll call fashion) are not required, however all affected element leads must ensure
      compliance. All participating aircraft within visual range (defined as < 5 NM) of a
      terminated fight, whether passed via a radio call or wing rock will:
          3.4.3.3.1. Cease tactical maneuvering with the terminating aircraft, group of aircraft,
          or as specified in the terminate call.
          3.4.3.3.2. Deconflict flight paths and climb/descend to a safe altitude, blocks or as
          briefed.
3.5. Communications Jamming Procedures.
   3.5.1. Exercise directors will brief restricted frequencies to include taboo, protected and
   guarded frequencies to all personnel directly associated with communication jamming
   missions (aircrew, ABMs/WDs, EWOs, jammers, JTAC) with emphasis placed on safety
   frequencies. Accomplish communication jamming only in tactical training areas.
   3.5.2. Preface all transmissions required for safety (e.g., weather changes, airspace
   advisories, etc.) with "SAFETY, SAFETY." Upon hearing this call all jammers on the
   frequency(s) will cease jamming to allow the transmission.
 14                                                               AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012


   3.5.3. Transmit "KNOCK-IT-OFF" when situations develop that meet paragraph 3.4.1 as a
   result of communication jamming.
   3.5.4. Any person employing communications spoofing will not use terms with safety
   implications (e.g., "KNOCK-IT-OFF," "CHATTER-MARK," or "SAFETY") as
   communication jamming tactics.
   3.5.5. Do not conduct communication jamming on Guard or any pre-designated safety
   frequency.
   3.5.6. In training, do not conduct communication jamming that would affect the following
   activities:
      3.5.6.1. Air-to-Air refueling.
      3.5.6.2. Actual personnel or cargo air drops.
      3.5.6.3. Aircraft in distress.
      3.5.6.4. Aircraft in IMC conditions.
      3.5.6.5. Live ordnance delivery missions.
3.6. Chaff, Flare, and Smokey Devil Procedures.
   3.6.1. Arm chaff, flare, and Smokey Devil systems only in an approved airspace.
   3.6.2. Smokey Devil or Flare Employment.
      3.6.2.1. Aircrew may employ flares or Value Engineering Change Proposal Smokey
      Devils (VECP SD) when operating over government owned or controlled property
      (including over-water warning areas). Aircrew will make every attempt to verify current
      fire conditions prior to employment. If unable to verify current fire conditions, aircrew
      will adhere to the most restrictive fire hazard procedures until a less restrictive update is
      received. Use the following minimum altitudes:
          3.6.2.1.1. No fire hazard: Aircrew may employ down to their minimum altitude
          unless a higher altitude is specified in range regulations.
          3.6.2.1.2. Fire hazard: According to applicable AFI 11-2MDS series directives or
          range regulations, whichever is most restrictive. Smokey Devils employment limited
          to 500 feet AGL.
      3.6.2.2. VECP SD minimum altitude for employment is 300 feet.
      3.6.2.3. Aircrew may employ       flares and VECP SD in a non-government owned or
      controlled training area (i.e.,   Military Operations Areas (MOA), Military Training
      Routes) only if the training      area has an approved AF Form 813, Request For
      Environment Impact Analysis.        Aircrew must contact the local airspace manager for
      information.
          3.6.2.3.1. In training areas over non-government-owned or controlled property,
          minimum flare employment altitude is 2,000 feet AGL unless specified otherwise in
          governing regulations. Outside the U.S. refer to host nation rules governing the
          employment of flares.
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                        15


   3.6.3. When employing chaff in the U.S. and Canada, refer to CJCSM 3212.02B,
   Performing Electronic Attack in the U.S. and Canada for Tests, Training, and Exercises,
   and/or in accordance with published range orders. Outside the U.S. and Canada, refer to host
   nation rules governing the employment of chaff.
3.7. Low Altitude Training Rules.
   3.7.1. Maneuvering transition to low altitude. [HELO exempt] Maximum dive angle
   during maneuvering flight below 5,000 feet AGL is the lesser of 45 degrees or one percent of
   AGL altitude (e.g., 40 degrees nose low at 4,000 feet AGL, 30 degrees nose low at 3,000 feet
   AGL, etc.). Reduce dives starting above 5,000 feet AGL to 45 degrees or less before passing
   5,000 feet AGL.
   3.7.2. Adhere to low altitude guidance IAW the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Volume 3.
3.8. Night Training Rules. [AFSOC guidance] [AMC guidance] This section adds additional
night TRs applicable to both Air-to-Air and Air-to-Surface night training.
   3.8.1. Day, Night, and Civil Twilight Procedures. Use day rules and procedures
   (operational and training) during civil twilight (defined in the air almanac or flight weather
   briefing). Use night or weather procedures when adverse conditions exist during civil
   twilight.
   3.8.2. Night Lighting and Illumination.
      3.8.2.1. Aircraft Lighting Category Definitions. (Note: These definitions do not relieve
      aircrew from complying with AFI 11-202V3 aircraft lighting requirements).
          3.8.2.1.1. Full-up: Normal aircraft lighting IAW AFI 11-202V3, General Flight
          Rules and any applicable waivers.
          3.8.2.1.2. Reduced: any lighting configuration other than full-up, normal lighting.
              3.8.2.1.2.1. Covert: Night lighting visible through NVGs but not visible to the
              naked eye.
              3.8.2.1.2.2. Lights-out: All external lights off.
      3.8.2.2. Adhere to MAJCOM guidance and/or AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 3, chapter 8
      guidance for training with Reduced/Covert/Lights-out settings.
      3.8.2.3. Illumination Levels.
          3.8.2.3.1. High Illumination (HI) is defined as illumination, derived from natural or
          artificial sources, of 2.2 millilux or greater, unless defined otherwise in AFI 11-
          2MDS series instructions.
          3.8.2.3.2. Low Illumination (LI) is defined as less than 2.2 millilux, unless defined
          otherwise in aircraft specific AFI 11-2MDS series instructions.
          3.8.2.3.3. In aircraft not equipped with in-flight illumination measuring devices, the
          flight lead or individual pilot is the final determining authority to assess actual
          illumination for a particular mission element based on visibility and terrain
          features/resolution.
 16                                                             AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012


         3.8.2.3.3.1. [AFSOC guidance] [AMC guidance] Missions planned for HI may
         transition to LI TRs in-flight depending upon weather, moon rise/set, artificial
         illumination, etc. Missions may not transition from LI mission to HI TRs unless the
         actual conditions permit (i.e., greater than 2.2 millilux), and the HI mission was both
         planned for and briefed.
   3.8.3. Minimum Altitude. [AMC guidance] The minimum altitude at night is Minimum
   Safe Altitude (MSA), Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA), or NVG minimum
   altitude as appropriate. MQ-1 and MQ-9/Special Operations/Airlift/Rescue aircraft may
   operate below the MSA according to AFI 11-2MDS series instructions.
      3.8.3.1. NVG minimum altitude [AFSOC guidance].
         3.8.3.1.1. With HI, the minimum altitude for NVG (non TF/TA) operations is 1,000
         feet AGL.
         3.8.3.1.2. With LI, the minimum altitude for NVG operations is the MSA.
      3.8.3.2. Aircraft conducting TF/TA operations with NVGs may use the lower of the two
      minimum altitudes.
   3.8.4. NVG Mission Planning and Operational Considerations.
      3.8.4.1. Mission Planning.
         3.8.4.1.1. NVG pre-mission planning will be accomplished using a DoD-approved
         light level-planning program.
         3.8.4.1.2. If ambient illumination is low and artificial illumination is planned to
         enhance the mission, a "no flares/artificial illumination" back-up option will be
         briefed.
         3.8.4.1.3. [AFSOC guidance] [HELO exempt] All flights will plan LI and no-NVG
         back-up options.
         3.8.4.1.4. Brief factors affecting NVG use to include current and forecasted weather,
         illumination, terrain, and physiological considerations.
      3.8.4.2. Operational Considerations.
         3.8.4.2.1. When only portions of participating aircraft are NVG-equipped, inter-flight
         deconfliction will be accomplished using visible lighting or positive altitude/area
         deconfliction. All aircraft will halt any reduced (covert or lights-out) lighting
         operations when a "KNOCK-IT-OFF" occurs until positive separation of aircraft is
         ensured.
         3.8.4.2.2. [AFSOC guidance] [AMC guidance] Failure of any portion of the NVGs
         requires an immediate transfer to instruments and establishment of non-NVG
         procedures. Resume NVG operations only after correcting the NVG malfunction.
3.9. RPA Training Rules.
   3.9.1. Briefing and Debriefing Requirements.

                              AIR-TO-AIR TRAINING RULES

4.1. Introduction. This chapter provides rules that apply to all categories of Air-to-Air training.
4.2. General Air-to-Air Training Rules.
   4.2.1. Briefing and Debriefing Requirements.
       4.2.1.1. Briefings and debriefings should take place in the following order of priority: 1)
       Face to Face; 2) Telephonic or electronic; 3) Airborne.
       4.2.1.2. As a minimum, face-to-face, telephonic and electronic briefings will cover the
       items in the General Coordination briefing guide in Attachment 2. For electronic
       briefings, confirm that the briefing is received and understood by the recipient.
       4.2.1.3. Flight debriefings will critically assess mission execution and offer solutions to
       problems encountered.
   4.2.2. Airspace. Conduct training within designated airspace. Both aircrew and ABM/WDs
   share joint responsibility for avoiding lateral spill-outs. It is the aircrew responsibility to
   avoid vertical spill-outs. Accomplish supersonic flight only in designated areas.
   4.2.3. Communications. Basic procedures are in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. The following
   additional procedures apply to Air-to-Air training:
       4.2.3.1. Aircrew will acknowledge all ABM/WD airspace and safety related calls.
       4.2.3.2. ABM/WD procedures:
           4.2.3.2.1. Advise aircrew of the bearing, range, heading, and altitude (if available) of
           previously unreported aircraft within 10 miles that are a potential hazard.
           4.2.3.2.2. Advise aircrew when the controlling agency cannot support a minimum of
           broadcast control. In this situation only continue an engagement if the aircrew can
           provide safe separation.
           4.2.3.2.3. Advise aircrew when they approach airspace boundaries (3 NM for fighters
           and 5 NM for non-fighters) or as directed by the ATC agency.
           4.2.3.2.4. Provide other pertinent information (e.g., airspace changes, weather in
           working area, system degradation, etc.).
       4.2.3.3. If using separate frequencies for opposing forces, ABMs, WDs, and/or Range
       Training Officers (RTOs) must have simultaneous monitor and broadcast capability on
       each working frequency. ABMs/WDs and/or RTOs will immediately pass all ―KNOCK-
       IT-OFFs‖, ―TERMINATEs‖ and safety of flight information to all participating aircraft.
   4.2.4. Live Air-to-Air Missile Carriage.
       4.2.4.1. Do not fly with live Air-to-Air missiles in peacetime, except under the following
       circumstances:
           4.2.4.1.1. Air defense alert aircraft, to include changeover sorties.
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                 19


        4.2.4.1.2. Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP) and Operational Test and
        Evaluation programs (reference Attachment 5).
        4.2.4.1.3. Aircraft flown following generation exercises.
        4.2.4.1.4. As authorized by MAJCOM/A3 (or equivalent), service directives, or
        OPLAN tasking.
     4.2.4.2. The following requirements apply to authorized carriage of live Air-to-Air
     missiles for other than WSEP firings:
        4.2.4.2.1. Aircrew will make a "WEAPONS SAFE" call upon initial check-in and
        before each setup following a KIO or terminate. Check the master arm switch in the
        SAFE, SIM/TRAIN, OFF, or equivalent position, and use the weapons panel or
        Heads Up Display (HUD) to verify Weapons Safe.
        4.2.4.2.2. Do not simulate weapons employment, squeeze trigger or depress the
        pickle button.
        4.2.4.2.3. Maximum maneuvering category is LIMITED.
        4.2.4.2.4. Do not use the terms ―HOSTILE‖ or ―KILL‖ at anytime.
  4.2.5. Simulated Gun/Missile/Laser Employment.
     4.2.5.1. To prevent inadvertent firings when simulating gun employment ensure the
     following:
        4.2.5.1.1. Have no ammunition loaded or safe the gun according to –34 Series T.O.s,
        or comply with AFI 11-2MDS Volume 3 guidance.
        4.2.5.1.2. Perform a trigger check (trigger squeeze) before simulated gun
        employment.
     4.2.5.2. Only A-10 aircraft may simulate gun employment with a gun that is not safe per
     paragraph 4.2.5.1.1. Adhere to procedures outlined in 11-2A-OA-10 Volume 3, A/OA-
     10 Operations Procedures.
     4.2.5.3. To train or simulate missile employment with a gun that is not safe IAW –34
     Series T.O.s, accomplish all of the following:
        4.2.5.3.1. Load no live missiles.
        4.2.5.3.2. Place the master arm switch in the SAFE, SIM/TRAIN, OFF, or equivalent
        position.
        4.2.5.3.3. Verify the weapons panel or HUD display SAFE, SIM, OFF, or equivalent
        position.
        4.2.5.3.4. Do not squeeze the gun trigger.
        4.2.5.3.5. Do not conduct basic fighter maneuver training (A-10 exempt).
     4.2.5.4. Air-to-Air Laser Employment.
        4.2.5.4.1. Air-to-Air lasing above the horizon must be coordinated through the JFCC-
        Space/J95 Laser Clearing House (LCH) (DSN 275-6565) IAW DoDI O-3100.11 and
20                                                              AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012


         STRATCOM Instruction 534-12. At present time, there are no aircraft mounted laser
         systems in the inventory that have LCH approval or waiver.
         4.2.5.4.2. Combat Laser Setting for Air-to-Air Employment. Laser-equipped aircraft
         are prohibited from using a combat laser setting during peacetime training missions
         unless the Operation Group (or equivalent) Commander specifically approves use for
         a training exercise, test, or WSEP. Unit will contact and abide by current guidelines
         established by the AFRL/RHDO Range Certification Team. (For Air-to Ground
         Laser Employment see paragraph 5.1.1.5)
  4.2.6. Fuel Requirements.
     4.2.6.1. Establish fuel minimums for each mission IAW approved directives.
     4.2.6.2. Perform ops checks prior to each engagement and/or periodically during the
     vulnerability period.
  4.2.7. Maneuvering Categories. This section provides maneuvering categories for aircraft
  during Air-to-Air training missions. This section also specifies the maximum maneuvering
  allowed during Air-to-Air training based on flight conditions (day, night, or weather) or
  altitude. If no weather call is made, maintain cloud clearances IAW briefed maneuvering
  category. The rules of this instruction, MAJCOM or service directives, or aircraft limitations
  apply, whichever is the more restrictive.
     4.2.7.1. The engagement begins when opposing aircraft initiate visual maneuvers against
     each other. The altitude of the lowest participating aircraft determines the maneuvering
     category. When in doubt, default to the more restrictive category.
     4.2.7.2. Weather Requirements for VMC Operations. Must maintain 2,000 feet vertical
     and 1 NM horizontal cloud clearance with 5 NM visibility and a discernible horizon. If
     unable to maintain cloud clearances, use IMC categories.
     4.2.7.3. UNLIMITED. Provides Air-to-Air training with no limitations on maneuvering
     other than AFI 11-2MDS and flight manual aircraft limitations.
         4.2.7.3.1. Minimum altitude is 5,000 feet AGL.
     4.2.7.4. LIMITED. Provides for Air-to-Air training with the following limitations.
         4.2.7.4.1. Offensive/Neutral aircraft have no maneuver restrictions pre-merge.
         4.2.7.4.2. An engagement can continue until:
             4.2.7.4.2.1. A ―TERMINATE‖ or ―KNOCK-IT-OFF‖ occurs.
             4.2.7.4.2.2. A role reversal between two opposing aircraft.
             4.2.7.4.2.3. [AFSOC guidance] A defender reaches 180 degree of turn at the start
             of the threat reaction. (A defender is an aircraft visually reacting to defeat an
             adversary's attack aft of his 3/9 line. All maneuvers into and out of the notch are
             excluded.)
             4.2.7.4.2.4. If neither aircraft can be clearly identified as the defender, the
             engagement will be terminated after the first aircraft reaches 180 degrees of turn
             after 3/9 line passage.
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                  21


     4.2.7.5. RESTRICTED. Provides for Air-to-Air training with heading changes of up to
     60 degrees either side of course. This does not apply to aircraft performing conversions
     versus RESTRICTED maneuvering targets.
     4.2.7.6. NON-MANEUVERING. Provides for Air-to-Air training by maintaining
     constant heading, airspeed, and altitude. This does not apply to aircraft performing
     conversions versus NON-MANEUVERING targets.
     4.2.7.7. CONTROLLED. Provides for Air-to-Air 1 v 1 night visual training conducted
     with NVGs. Maneuvers are fluid and continue beyond 180 degrees, but maneuvering
     options for the defensive fighter are predetermined and restricted to a maximum of 540
     degrees of turn. Controlled maneuvering may only be conducted as authorized in
     applicable Volume of AFI 11-2MDS series guidance. Abide by the following restrictions:
         4.2.7.7.1. Minimum altitude is 5000 feet AGL.
  4.2.8. Low Altitude (LOWAT). Applies to maneuvering below 5,000 feet AGL (fixed
  wing).
     4.2.8.1. LIMITED is the maximum maneuvering category.
     4.2.8.2. Do not perform rolling or exaggerated vertical maneuvering.
     4.2.8.3. Defender’s reactions must be level to climbing. (Note: AFSOC, units under
     AFSOC oversight, or AFSOC gained fixed wing aircraft may execute descending
     defensive reactions).
     4.2.8.4. Minimum altitude for aircraft engaged in offensive and defensive Air-to-Air
     maneuvering is 300 feet AGL (250 feet for AFSOC assigned/gained aircraft, and aircraft
     operated under AFSOC lead command guidance), pilot minimums, as directed by MDS-
     specific instructions, or range/airspace restrictions whichever is higher.
     4.2.8.5. [AFSOC guidance] Minimum altitude for aircraft engaged in offensive and
     defensive Air-to-Air maneuvering overwater is 1,000 feet AGL.
     4.2.8.6. Minimum altitude for aircraft not engaged in offensive or defensive
     maneuvering at low altitude is 100 ft AGL, pilot minimums, as directed by MDS-specific
     instructions or range/airspace restrictions whichever is higher.
     4.2.8.7. Upon completion of a defensive reaction at low altitude, do not perform
     additional reactions to follow-on attacks beyond visual range (defined as > 5 NM) until
     reestablishing the pre-briefed minimum MDS-specific tactical airspeed.
     4.2.8.8. Determine minimum altitudes by referencing MAJCOM directives, service
     directives, and personal low altitude minimums, whichever is higher.
  4.2.9. Night.
     4.2.9.1. LIMITED is the maximum maneuvering category unless flying CONTROLLED
     maneuvering exercises.
     4.2.9.2. Include frequent flight instrument cross-checks during all engagements.
     4.2.9.3. No visual-only intercepts for non-NVG equipped aircrew.
22                                                               AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012


     4.2.9.4. For NVG-equipped aircrew, visual-only intercepts are authorized if a discernable
     horizon exists, target line-of-sight (LOS) rate is observed, and range/altitude to complete
     the intercept is perceived. If no target LOS rate is observed, or range/altitude to complete
     the intercept is not perceived using NVGs, another instrument or sensor must be used to
     complete the intercept. If a discernable horizon is lost during the intercept, revert to non-
     NVG night operations and ensure safe separation of aircraft. If unable to ensure safe
     separation discontinue the intercept.
     4.2.9.5. No air-to-air gun attacks except during Controlled Maneuvering
  4.2.10. Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). Conduct IMC intercepts in
  approved special use airspace under the control of or monitored by GCI/AWACS. Without
  GCI/AWACS control, IMC intercepts are approved in restricted areas, warning areas above
  18,000 feet MSL, or in Air Traffic Control Assigned Airspace (ATCAA) unless prohibited
  by published range operating procedures or additional MDS-specific restrictions. If
  GCI/AWACS is unavailable, and there is no RTO or the RTO does not track all players, all
  aircraft will maintain their altitude blocks at all times, adversaries will be NON-
  MANEUVERING and blue air will be RESTRICTED maneuvering for the duration of the
  intercept.
     4.2.10.1. IMC rules will apply when LIMITED maneuvering weather criteria cannot be
     maintained. If IMC conditions exist in the entirety of the operating airspace, IMC Only
     rules will apply to the entire engagement IAW paragraph 4.2.10.2. In cases where IMC
     conditions will affect the majority or portions of the airspace (geographically or altitude),
     a combination of IMC rules and UNLIMITED maneuvering or IMC rules and LIMITED
     maneuvering can be used IAW paragraph 4.2.10.3. Conduct IMC intercept training no
     lower than 5,000 feet AWL or MSA over land. (EXCEPTION: AFSOC, units under
     AFSOC oversight, or AFSOC gained aircraft conducting IMC intercept training above
     3,000 feet AGL may maneuver up to the limitations specified for the LIMITED
     maneuvering category. When conducting IMC intercept training below 3,000 feet AGL,
     AFSOC, units under AFSOC oversight, or AFSOC gained aircraft are limited to the
     RESTRICTED maneuvering category.)
     4.2.10.2. IMC Only Rule. When IMC conditions exist in the entirety of the operating
     airspace ―IMC Only Rules‖ will apply. Flight Leads will designate training aids (i.e.,
     adversary aircraft) and altitude blocks. When all aircraft are outside of 10 NM (15 NM
     for F-22/F-35), training aids may maneuver within the following parameters (60 degrees
     of bank, +/- 15 degrees of pitch), in order to set the desired picture and to accomplish pre-
     briefed and scripted threat reactions only. Outside 10 NM (15 NM with F-22/F-35), blue
     air may maneuver within the following parameters (60 degrees of bank, +/- 15 degrees of
     pitch), in order to execute their tactics and perform benign threat reactions (i.e. OUTs and
     ABORTs). If the bank/pitch limits are inadvertently exceeded, pilots will terminate
     tactical maneuvering in their aircraft and recover to within the prescribed limits. Once
     back within limits, tactical maneuvering may resume. If deconfliction is in doubt due to
     formation spacing, altitude changes in IMC, regardless of role, will be coordinated to
     ensure aircraft separation requirements are met (i.e., "Blue 1 out bullseye 250/19,
     descending Angels 25"). NLT 10 NM (15 NM for F-22/F-35), GCI/AWACS (or the
     RTO as long as all players are tracking), will make a "10 NM (15 NM for F-22/F-35),
     check blocks" call. From that point on, training aids will be NON-MANEUVERING,
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                      23


     blue air will be RESTRICTED maneuvering and all aircraft will maintain the pre-briefed
     altitude blocks until KIO/TERMINATE is called, kill removing, or clear of all aircraft
     (outside of 10/15 NM).
     4.2.10.3. When IMC conditions are expected to affect the majority or portions of the
     airspace, ―IMC Rules/UNLIMITED clear of clouds‖ or ―IMC Rules/LIMITED clear of
     clouds‖ can be applied. This will allow a less scripted engagement and maximize
     training where weather allows. The War Call will be based on the weather call or
     PIREPs and will be acknowledged. If the weather is broken from 12,000 to 23,000, an
     example war call is as follows: ―Blue 1, War Call is IMC Rules/Unlimited clear of
     clouds. 25,000 foot floor, 10,000 foot ceiling.‖ Floor and ceiling in this war would be
     treated as a transition to IMC rules. If desiring all aircraft to remain clear of clouds, a
     split war can be called. ―Blue 1, War Call is split war. 25,000 foot floor, 10,000 foot
     ceiling.‖ (In cases where sloping/uneven decks do not lend to making a uniform floor or
     ceiling, High War, Low War, Split War, IMC/Unlimited War, IMC/Limited War can be
     called without floor and/or ceiling whereby players will execute IAW VFR cloud
     clearances when VMC.) Cloud bases must be greater than 5,000 feet AGL to execute a
     transition from IMC to Unlimited or Limited below a deck. If maximum maneuvering
     category is unknown, execute IAW the most restrictive. See Attachment 6 for visual
     depiction of different War Call examples.
         4.2.10.3.1. IMC. All aircraft will adhere to the maneuvering restrictions of 60
         degrees of bank, +/- 15 degrees of pitch when in or transitioning to the weather.
         Outside 10 NM (15 NM for F-22/F-35), aircraft may turn as required to execute
         tactics but deconfliction from both adversaries (altitude primary) and friendlies
         (geography, datalink, altitude, Air-Air TACAN, etc.) must be ensured. NLT 10 NM
         (15 NM with F-22/F-35), GCI/AWACS (or the RTO as long as all players are
         tracking), will make a "10 NM (15 NM for F-22/F-35), check blocks" call. Once
         inside of 10 NM (15 NM for F-22/F-35) red air will be non-maneuvering and blue air
         will be restricted maneuvering until a KIO/TERMINATE is called, kill removing, or
         clear of all aircraft (outside of 10/15 NM).
         4.2.10.3.2. VMC. The maximum maneuvering category will be UNLIMITED or
         LIMITED, based on the briefing or War Call when operating in VMC with the cloud
         clearances IAW paragraph 4.2.7.2.
         4.2.10.3.3. Transitioning blocks in either IMC (+/- 15 degrees of pitch) or VMC will
         be in accordance with paragraph 4.2.11.6.
         4.2.10.3.4. If an aircraft operating clear of clouds inadvertently enters IMC, they will
         immediately transition to instruments and execute a climb/descent (+/- 15 degrees of
         pitch) to their assigned altitude block. This block will be maintained until meeting
         the requirements of paragraph 4.2.11.6 to change blocks.
  4.2.11. Separation of Aircraft. Each participant must use "see and avoid" techniques to
  ensure a clear flight path, especially while entering and exiting engagements. Aircrew must
  assume that adversaries do not see their aircraft and may maneuver in an unpredictable
  manner. If loss of visual or tally occurs, establish positive separation until regaining visual
  contact. Flight leads will ensure deconfliction for concurrent missions in the same airspace.
24                                                             AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012


     4.2.11.1. Attackers losing sight will maneuver away from the defender's last known
     position and make a ―NO JOY‖ call if in radio contact with target aircraft.
     4.2.11.2. Defenders losing sight and SA will maneuver predictably and make a ―NO
     JOY‖ call if in radio contact with the attacking aircraft.
     4.2.11.3. If the attacker cannot ensure separation from trailers within a lead-trail
     formation, do not perform rear quarter attacks against the leaders.
     4.2.11.4. Minimum Separation. The minimum slant range between aircraft during Air-
     to-Air maneuvering is 500 feet unless; 1,000 feet for night, weather, bomber, tanker,
     airlift, AFSOC/Rescue fixed-wing, and FTU student Basic and Qualification training or
     as directed by syllabus, or 1,500 feet during CONTROLLED maneuvering exercises.
     Aircrew will not penetrate a 1,000 feet vertically or 1,500 feet horizontally of the
     JSTARS and AWACS. (Exceptions to minimum slant ranges are outlined in paragraph
     4.9 for Low/Slow VID and paragraph 4.7 for helicopter versus helicopter training).
     4.2.11.5. Altitude Blocks. Assign hard altitudes or altitude blocks to provide vertical
     separation for non-visual setups. Aircrew cannot rely on altitude blocks to guarantee
     separation once any participant initiates visual maneuvering.
        4.2.11.5.1. A minimum of 1,000 feet vertical separation between altitude blocks is
        required at or above 5,000 feet AGL.
        4.2.11.5.2. A minimum of 500 feet vertical separation between altitude blocks is
        required below 5,000 feet AGL. (100 feet between A-10s and helicopters during anti-
        helicopter training).
        4.2.11.5.3. Ensure deconfliction from friendly forces within 10 NM. Where visual
        deconfliction is not possible, utilize a minimum of 1,000 feet (500 if below 5,000 feet
        AGL) altitude separation or deconflict by geography, timing, onboard systems, or
        GCI/AWACS.
        4.2.11.5.4. F-22/F-35s and their adversaries will use a 15 NM range for block
        adherence and separation of aircraft in lieu of the 10 NM guidance. Aircraft may
        leave their blocks inside of 15 NM IAW paragraph 4.2.11.6.                If the
        AWACS/GCI/RTOs are unavailable, all players must be on a common frequency and
        a "15 miles check blocks" call will be made by the closest F-22A to the adversary
        aircraft.
     4.2.11.6. Transitioning Blocks.
        4.2.11.6.1. Aircraft may not transit or enter the altitude or altitude block of any
        adversary unless at least one of the following conditions applies: (Note: For
        helicopter versus helicopter see paragraph 4.7)
            4.2.11.6.1.1. All adversaries are beyond 10 NM (15 NM for F-22/F-35).
            4.2.11.6.1.2. Tally is established on all aircraft in the group of interest and no
            conflict with other groups within 10 NM exists.
            4.2.11.6.1.3. Not Tally with all adversaries within 10 NM but not a conflict (i.e.,
            no collision potential) based on SA.
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                       25


              4.2.11.6.1.4. Verbally confirm adversary's hard altitude and maintain required
              vertical separation.
       4.2.11.7. When two aircraft approach head-on, each will clear to the right unless
       maneuvering to do so would result in crossing flight paths. Aircraft with the higher nose
       position will attempt to go above the opponent if energy state permits.
       4.2.11.8. Attackers will cease weapons employment under the following conditions:
          4.2.11.8.1. Pure pursuit, head-on missile attacks prior to 9,000 feet slant range (3,000
          feet for helicopter versus helicopter). Maneuver aggressively to deconflict flight
          paths so as not to violate minimum range.
          4.2.11.8.2. Any gun attack exceeding 135 degrees aspect (except fighter vs.
          helicopter engagements where all participants remain in their blocks).
          4.2.11.8.3. Target aircraft begins an Air-to-Surface delivery maneuver below 5000
          feet AGL or employing live ordnance.
          4.2.11.8.4. Target aircraft conducting helicopter air-to-air refueling.
          4.2.11.8.5. F-22/F-35s attacking or any aircraft attacking F-22s will terminate
          weapons employment NLT 1000 feet slant range to avoid a 500 foot bubble.
   4.2.12. Single-Ship Operations. [AFSOC guidance] [HELO exempt] CMR and BMC Air-
   to-Air qualified pilots may fly single-ship Air-to-Air training missions in accordance with
   paragraph 3.3. IQT/MQT aircrew requires an instructor or squadron supervisor on board the
   aircraft.
   4.2.13. Visual Engagements. Flight leads will strictly enforce briefed training DLOs in all
   visual engagements, and will terminate maneuvering so as to prevent degradation in flight
   safety or mission/scenario conduct.
       4.2.13.1. No more than eight aircraft may participate in the same visual engagement.
       4.2.13.2. For multi-role aircraft a maximum of four similar aircraft may participate in an
       unlimited maneuvering visual engagement.

                               AIR-TO-SURFACE TRAINING

5.1. Introduction. This chapter describes procedures for tactical Air-to-Surface training. Use
the procedures in this chapter along with operational command directives, ATC regulations, and
letters of agreement. These weapons employment procedures provide aircrew and JTACs typical
procedures for weapons employment under fixed conditions. For additional FTU or MQT
restrictions and termination rules see paragraph 5.3.8 Find further procedures for formal course
training in the applicable syllabi. For Special Operations and Mobility Air-to-Surface operations,
follow the guidance in this chapter and AFI 11-2MDS Volumes 1 and 3, AFI 13-217, and AFI
11-231. During joint and coalition air operations, AF aircrew will thoroughly brief other
participants on the differences between their operating procedures and this AFI.
   5.1.1. Air-to-Surface Training Missions.
       5.1.1.1. Perform all delivery passes (including jettison passes), whether hot or dry, using
       live ordnance delivery parameters to include fuse arming, safe escape, safe separation,
       and flight deconfliction considerations.
       5.1.1.2. Avoid populated areas to the maximum extent possible when carrying externally
       loaded heavyweight inert or externally/internally loaded live ordnance.
           5.1.1.2.1. For the purpose of this instruction, AC-130 munitions in the ammunitions
           storage-and-handling systems and weapons carried by helicopters are not considered
           live ordnance.
       5.1.1.3. Prior to first release when carrying expendable ordnance (live, inert, or training),
       final switch configuration for weapon release will not be accomplished until the aircraft
       is in such a position that any accidental release will be contained within the range.
       MAJCOMs or theater COMAFFOR will develop specific guidance for armament system
       configurations for multiple passes. Refer to aircraft specific AFI 11-2MDS series
       operating procedures and individual range supplements for additional guidance.
       5.1.1.4. Do not conduct simulated attacks against off-range or manned targets with
       internally/externally loaded live ordnance or externally loaded heavyweight inert
       ordnance. This restriction does not apply to 20/30mm ammunition, BDU-33s, 2.75 inch
       TP / SP rockets, or non-expendable training assets (e.g. captive air-to-air and air-to-
       ground missiles, GBU-15 captive flight trainer, MQ-9 hard-wired GBU-38 inerts etc.).
           5.1.1.4.1. Simulated attacks against off-range targets or manned targets are permitted
           with expendable training ordnance loaded on the aircraft only IAW AFI 11-2MDS
           series regulations and local guidance for specific cockpit configurations and switch
           settings/actuations. If guidance is insufficient or a reasonable possibility exists that
           inadvertent/unintentional release may cause injury, death, or destruction of property,
           then simulated attacks off-range or against manned targets are prohibited.
       5.1.1.5. The use of ―combat‖ laser mode of a laser designator is restricted to laser
       certified ranges. A listing of laser certified ranges can be obtained from AFRL 711th
       HPW/RHDO. All air-to-surface laser operations on-range will be IAW AFI 13-212
       Range Planning and Operations, AFI 11-2MDS, and local range procedures.
32                                                             AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012


        5.1.1.5.1. Off-range laser emissions are authorized if the system is in training mode
        and the training mode has been certified as ―eye-safe.‖ Off-range laser emissions in
        non-training modes are authorized IAW the minimum slant range in Table 5.1.
        5.1.1.5.2. Reference paragraph 4.2.5.4 for further guidance on Air-to-Air Laser
        Employment.
        5.1.1.5.3. When working with ground personnel, aircrew will inform them prior to
        employing lasers in the combat mode. Upon acknowledgement, ground personnel will
        ensure proper eye protection is in place.
     5.1.1.6. Aircraft employing Inertially Aided Munitions (IAMs) in bomb-on-coordinate
     mode or aircraft employing any ordnance in a system delivery mode on coordinates only
     will adhere to the following prior to release:
        5.1.1.6.1. Aircrew will confirm the accuracy of the aircraft navigation and weapon
        delivery systems IAW MDS specific publications.
        5.1.1.6.2. Aircrew will ensure accurate receipt and entry of target coordinates and
        confirm they come from a valid target source. These coordinates will be verified via
        read-back from target data entry displays or will be cross-checked with mission
        planning data, range guides, or visual/sensor confirmation of target with a valid target
        source. Aircrew will verify correct data is selected prior to the ―IN‖ call. Examples
        of valid target sources include, but are not limited to Range Control Officers (RCOs),
        JTACs, Range Guides, or FAC(A) qualified aircrew, or the coordinates may be
        generated on-board the aircraft and then entered into the weapon/steer point/waypoint
        (as appropriate per weapon and platform).
        5.1.1.6.3. Aircrew will use all means available to verify accuracy of target
        coordinates/elevation, and that the coordinates are within the anticipated target area.
        Examples of available means include but are not limited to; Targeting Pod (TGP),
        Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), radar, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) map, HUD
        cueing, other aircraft sensors, terrain pointers, map plots, data links, radio
        communications, talk-on with JTACs, RCOs, other aircrew members, etc.
        5.1.1.6.4. Aircrew will confirm and adhere to published range operating procedures
        and restrictions, including any additional MDS-specific weapons delivery
        requirements.
     5.1.1.7. When ordnance is employed, minimum safe distances for personnel from all
     targets will comply with Weapon Danger Zone (WDZ) footprints as described in AFI 13-
     212 or local directives, whichever are more restrictive. HQ ACC/A3A is the USAF
     executive agent for procuring and modifying WDZ weapon safety footprints.
        5.1.1.7.1. Close Air Support (CAS)/Air-to-Ground EXCEPTION. If training requires
        personnel to be inside Hazard Area or Impact Area, Tactical Air Control Parties
        (TACP), JTACs, aircrew, or other briefed participants in CAS/air-to-ground training
        may use the Minimum Safe Distances (MSD) for Ground Parties (Training Use Only:
        Live Fire) provided in AFTTP 3-2.6, JFIRE Multi-service Tactics, Techniques, and
        Procedures for the Application of Firepower (available at the ALSA Web site
        (www.alsa.mil)). If unable to comply with MSD assumptions outlined in JFIRE,
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                        33


          personnel will then use WDZ distances as outlined above. MSDs are not to be
          mistaken with Risk Estimate Distances (RED) defined in JP 3-09.3, Close Air
          Support and listed in AFTTP 3-2.6, JFIRE Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and
          Procedures for the Application of Fire. REDs are for combat use only.
       5.1.1.8. For missions falling under the Joint Live Fire Exercise definition, refer to
       Attachment 4 for additional guidance.
5.2. Authorized Employment Patterns.
   5.2.1. Class A Range. Aircraft within a flight will fly the same delivery pattern
   (rectangular, pop attacks, etc.); however, aircrew may mix events or delivery modes when
   using the same target, same type delivery, and if approved by the RCO. Fly radio-silent
   attacks, random attacks, element tactics, split pop-up attacks, etc., only if allowed by range
   procedures, if prebriefed, and if approved by the RCO.
5.3. Air-to-Surface Training Rules. See paragraph 5.5 for additional night rules.
   5.3.1. Weather Minimums [AFSOC guidance] (USAF helicopters follow AFI 11-
   2MDS/MAJCOM guidance):
       5.3.1.1. For VMC operations the ceiling must be 1,500 feet AGL, or at least 500 feet
       above the highest portion of the weapons delivery pattern, whichever is higher. (N/A for
       fixed wing level deliveries above 5,000 feet AGL.) For rotary wing operations the
       ceiling must be 800 feet AGL or at least 500 feet above the highest portion of the
       weapons delivery pattern, whichever is higher.
          5.3.1.1.1. Visibility will be at least 3 NM for fixed-wing and 2 NM for helicopters
          (USAFE 5 KM for fixed-wing and 3.5 KM for helicopters).
          5.3.1.1.2. Daylight weapons delivery events on over water ranges require a
          discernible horizon unless TF/TA equipped.
       5.3.1.2. For IMC deliveries, deliveries through an undercast, level deliveries above 5,000
       feet AGL and/or TF/TA operations, the ceiling and visibility must be IAW AFI 11-2MDS
       series aircraft instructions and range supplements.
   5.3.2. Range Entry.
       5.3.2.1. Before weapons delivery on Class B/C ranges, positively identify the authorized
       target and confirm the target area is clear of unauthorized persons or vessels (with on
       board or remote sensors, or via reports from authorized sources). Range personnel, to
       include those who directly observe or use remote scoring cameras, FAC(A)/JTAC, IG
       chase aircraft, departing flights or other aircraft sharing the range are authorized sources
       that may be used to ensure the target area is clear. If the target area cannot be cleared by
       these means, perform a dry clearing pass/dry First Run Attack (FRA) before weapons
       delivery.
       5.3.2.2. If planning a weapons delivery requiring visual acquisition of the target (e.g.
       visual delivery, TGP, FLIR delivery), accomplish a dry familiarization pass when an
       aircrew has not been on that range for more than 1 year. Aircrew will familiarize
       themselves with range boundaries, target locations, and friendly locations on the range.
       If the familiarization pass is flown as a dry FRA, aircrew must familiarize themselves
34                                                              AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012


     with the range and the range must still be cleared as stated above prior to expending
     ordnance. See paragraph 5.5.1 for additional night restrictions and Attachment 4 for
     additional joint live fire exercise restrictions.
         5.3.2.2.1. Units participating in a scheduled and monitored air-to-ground Weapons
         System Evaluation Program (WSEP) are exempt from 5.3.2.2.
  5.3.3. Conventional range pattern operations are limited to a maximum of four attacking
  aircraft at any one time.
  5.3.4. Single-Ship Operations. See paragraph 3.3 for additional restrictions (N/A for
  RPA) [AFSOC guidance] [HELO exempt].
     5.3.4.1. Class A Ranges. CMR and BMC aircrew may perform single-ship conventional
     and nuclear deliveries (to include pops). IQT and MQT aircrew may perform single-ship
     conventional and nuclear deliveries only if there is an instructor or squadron supervisor in
     the aircraft.
         5.3.4.1.1. For multi-specialty crewed aircraft (i.e., B-1, B-52, F-15E) weapons-
         qualified non-specialty instructors may supervise a live or inert weapons delivery
         provided the MQT crewmember has previously completed training requirements for
         that specific weapon with an instructor of like specialty.
     5.3.4.2. Class B/C Ranges or Off-Range Simulated Deliveries.
         5.3.4.2.1. Under the control of a JTAC/FAC(A), CMR/BMC aircrew, MQT aircrew
         with an instructor or squadron supervisor in the aircraft, and FTU students with an
         instructor in the aircraft may accomplish deliveries and maverick attacks.
         5.3.4.2.2. When not under the control of a JTAC/FAC(A), CMR/BMC aircrew, MQT
         aircrew with an instructor or squadron supervisor in the aircraft, and FTU students
         with an instructor in the aircraft may accomplish deliveries and maverick attacks.
         Minimum recovery altitude for diving deliveries or Maverick attacks is 4,500 feet
         AGL.
     5.3.4.3. CMR/BMC flight leads or FAC(A) aircrew may perform single-ship low altitude
     tactical navigation (LATN) to their minimum altitude qualification. Wingmen and MQT
     aircrew may perform single-ship LATN only if there is an instructor or squadron
     supervisor in the aircraft. Exception: T-38 Continuation Training Program aircraft with
     two rated aircrew on-board may fly LATN.
     5.3.4.4. To preclude landing with live or inert heavyweight ordnance, MQT/IQT aircrew
     may fly a single-ship mission to an appropriate range and release ordnance on one, non-
     tactical pass above the fragmentation envelope derived from Conventional Weapons
     Delivery Software (CWDS).
     5.3.4.5. Qualified FAC(A)s may perform full mission profiles while single-ship IAW
     AFI11-2MDS procedures.
  5.3.5. Switch Changes. Range restrictions permitting, cockpit switch changes that are
  accomplished by the pilot flying the aircraft will be made prior to the final attack heading
  unless normally required for system-aided deliveries or tactics (N/A for HOTAS).
  5.3.6. Minimum Altitudes. See paragraph 5.5 for additional night minimums.
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                        35


     5.3.6.1. Determine minimum release and recovery altitudes by using established AFTTP
     3-1.MDS procedures, fuzing and fragmentation envelopes, and the weapon delivery
     minimum altitudes established by AFI 11-2MDS series guidance, T.O. 1-1M-34, CWDS,
     range supplements, and this instruction, whichever are higher.
     5.3.6.2. In addition to the minimum altitudes established in AFI 11-2MDS Volume 1
     guidance, apply the following minimum altitudes:
         5.3.6.2.1. Level Deliveries: 200 feet AGL (50 feet AGL for helicopters, N/A for
         hover fire).
         5.3.6.2.2. LAHD: 300 feet AGL on a Class B/C.
         5.3.6.2.3. Nuclear and Radar Events: 200 feet AGL.
         5.3.6.2.4. Low Angle Strafe/Long Range Strafe/Two Target Strafe (LAS/LRS/TTS):
         75 feet AGL (50 feet AGL for helicopters).
     5.3.6.3. Pilots will not descend below their designated low-level category at any time
     (for example, conventional downwind, approach to a pop-up point) unless on final for
     low angle bombing, low angle rockets, level bombing, and LAS/LRS/TTS attacks.
     5.3.6.4. For nuclear weapons delivery patterns, use a minimum of 1,000 feet AGL on
     downwind except when operating with a TF/TA system.
  5.3.7. Abort Criteria. Along with the general criteria set in paragraph 3.4 (KIO and
  Terminate Procedures), cease-fire, and/or abort the pass and do not release if any of the
  following situations occur:
     5.3.7.1. If friendly troops and/or JTAC position near target area is inside minimum
     distance restrictions or friendly position cannot be confirmed (see paragraph 5.1.1.7).
     5.3.7.2. If over water and the discernible horizon or the land-water contrast is lost (N/A
     for AC-130s, helicopters, or aircraft with a TF/TA system).
     5.3.7.3. If unable to positively identify the target or confirm correct target coordinates for
     IAM deliveries or system deliveries in coordinate only mode.
     5.3.7.4. If the aircraft passes below the minimum recovery cue/altitude established in
     AFI11-2MDS series guidance, this chapter, attack planning procedures provided in
     AFTTP 3-1.MDS series, or the planned minimum recovery for the event being flown.
     5.3.7.5. If entry or release conditions do not meet the planned parameters. Note: Abort
     the pass if the actual dive angle will exceed the planned dive angle by more than 5
     degrees at release (10 degrees if the planned recovery altitude is 10,000 feet or above).
     Note: High Altitude Strafe (HAS) deliveries will be constructed allowing for no more
     than a 5 degree variation (steep or shallow) from the planned dive angle
     5.3.7.6. If airspeed drops below minimums specified in appropriate AFI 11-2MDS series
     regulations.
     5.3.7.7. (For A/OA-10 aircraft) If aircraft is within 3,000 feet slant range from a hard
     target during LRS/LAS/TTS. Note: Aircraft will not approach within 500 feet or cross
     the 3-9 line of any hard target being shot during aircraft recovery.
36                                                               AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012


  5.3.8. FTU and MQT Restrictions and Termination Rules (N/A for helicopters).
     5.3.8.1. Students will not change targets once initiating roll-in to final except during Two
     Target Strafe (TTS).
     5.3.8.2. Pop-up Restrictions.
         5.3.8.2.1. Terminate a pop-up attack if the actual pull-up point is inside the planned
         pull-up point.
         5.3.8.2.2. Do not perform pop-up attacks from fighting wing or closer position.
         5.3.8.2.3. Terminate the pass if the roll-in will require less than 15 degrees or more
         than 90 degrees of turn.
     5.3.8.3. LANTIRN students will fly direct pop attacks only when engaged in syllabus
     directed training missions.
  5.3.9. Weapons Delivery Spacing.
     5.3.9.1. For actual or simulated tactical deliveries, aircrew must ensure minimum
     spacing and attack geometry meet T.O. 1-1M-34 deconfliction requirements (e.g., aircraft
     to aircraft, aircraft to weapons, etc.), range specific operating procedures, or local
     operating procedures, whichever is more restrictive. Use T.O. 1-1M-34 or CWDS to
     determine minimum spacing when employing ordnance.
     5.3.9.2. Use the following minimum spacing on final during level or climbing deliveries
     with training ordnance in a basic surface attack conventional or radar pattern:
         5.3.9.2.1. Level/Diving - Minimum formation deconfliction spacing time for the
         ordnance simulated or 15 seconds, whichever is greater.
         5.3.9.2.2. Climbing/Loft/Toss - 30 seconds.
         5.3.9.2.3. When subsequent aircraft conduct a delivery that requires target over flight
         following a climbing delivery by a preceding aircraft, use bomb time-of-fall from
         release plus 30 seconds to ensure the subsequent aircraft crosses the target after bomb
         impact.
  5.3.10. Fouls.
     5.3.10.1. Assess a foul for any of the following reasons:
         5.3.10.1.1. Violation of flight or range safety.
         5.3.10.1.2. If an aircraft passes below the minimum recovery cue/altitude as
         established in AFI 11-2MDS series instructions or this instruction for the event being
         flown.
         5.3.10.1.3. An unintentional double-firing burst versus a single target or strafing past
         the foul line.
         5.3.10.1.4. A lazy recovery from a LAS/LRS/TTS pass resulting in the aircraft
         descending below 75 feet.
         5.3.10.1.5. Aircraft expending on wrong target.
         5.3.10.1.6. Aircraft expending ordnance without clearance.
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                           37


       5.3.10.2. Aircrew will not perform further deliveries after receiving a second foul on the
       range or a single dangerous foul, or as determined by the RCO or flight lead.
   5.3.11. Last Strafe Pass Procedure. [HELO exempt] The last strafe pass will be dry unless
   each aircraft accomplishes an escape maneuver and an immediate turn after recovery. If
   performing a dry pass, check switches in SAFE, SIM, OFF, or equivalent position before
   initiating the last pass.
   5.3.12. Armament Safety Procedures.
       5.3.12.1. After completing weapon deliveries, flight leads will reform their flights,
       ensure an armament safety check has been accomplished by each flight member and
       perform a battle damage check. Check the master arm switch in the SAFE, SIM, OFF, or
       equivalent position, and use the weapons panel or Heads Up Display (HUD) to verify the
       Weapons Safe position. Flight leads will ensure that each flight member verbally
       confirms switches are safe. Battle damage checks are not required at night or in IMC.
       5.3.12.2. If unable to confirm ordnance expenditure on the range, perform a visual bomb
       check. The aircrew, RCO, JTAC, B-1 Stores Management System (SMS), B-2 Mission
       Management System, B-52 Stores Management Overlay for MIL-STD-1760 weapons, or
       another flight member can all confirm ordnance expenditure. If visual confirmation is not
       feasible (for example, night), follow hung ordnance or unconfirmed hung ordnance
       procedures.
   5.3.13. Recovery From Delivery. Execute recoveries from weapons deliveries according to
   safe escape maneuvers described in T.O. 1MDS-34-1-1 aircraft specific T.O.s. Recoveries
   will observe minimum altitudes consistent with safe escape, fuse arming, and the weapon
   delivery minimum altitudes established by AFI 11-2MDS series guidance, T.O. 1-1M-34,
   CWDS, range supplements, and this instruction, whichever are higher. Turning maneuver
   safe escapes resulting in a descending turn are not authorized.
   5.3.14. Flight Composition. A tactical unit possessing dissimilar fighters with integrated
   missions (e.g., SEAD aircraft, buddy lasing, etc.) may employ as mixed elements when
   tactically sound.
   5.3.15. Release Authority. Only a fully qualified Range Control Officer or a
   JTAC/FAC(A)/flight lead when approved by an RCO or applicable range order are
   authorized to allow ordnance release on a Class A/B/C range.
5.4. Range Radio Procedures. See paragraph 5.5 for additional night radio procedures.
   5.4.1. Radio Contact. Do not expend ordnance on a Class A or Class B/C manned range
   without two-way radio contact with the RCO or JTAC on duty. Aircrew will acknowledge all
   applicable transmissions by the RCO or JTAC.
   5.4.2. Range Entry. Before weapons delivery on a Class A range (or when using scoring on
   a Class B range), flight leaders will confirm the lineup and events. The RCO will confirm
   range, traffic pattern (when applicable), altimeter setting, and strafe panel (when applicable).
   The flight lead will read back the applicable range, traffic pattern, altimeter setting, and strafe
   panel. Flight members acknowledge with call sign.
   5.4.3. Class A Range Standard Radio Calls.
 38                                                              AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012


      5.4.3.1. Day Conventional.
          5.4.3.1.1. "Call Sign, BASE."
          5.4.3.1.2. "Call Sign, UP" (pop-up patterns only).
          5.4.3.1.3. "Call Sign, IN" and add "DRY" if appropriate. Abort the pass without
          clearance to drop ordnance. (Day Conventional passes do not require an ―OFF HOT‖
          call) (―IN DRY‖ radio calls should be used anytime a dry pass is intended, to include
          approved off range training).
          5.4.3.1.4. "Call Sign, OFF, DRY" if intent was to release but no weapon was
          released.
      5.4.3.2. Nuclear patterns and conventional bomber racetrack patterns:
          5.4.3.2.1. "Call Sign, BASE."
          5.4.3.2.2. "Call Sign, FINAL (Event) and add ―DRY" if appropriate.‖
          5.4.3.2.3. "Call Sign, OFF HOT or DRY."
   5.4.4. Modify radio calls on a Class B or C ranges to suit the tactical situation (for example,
   communications jamming).
   5.4.5. In addition to the clearance procedures in JP 3-09.3, the following clearance calls will
   be used by FAC(A)/JTAC/RCO during dry employment.
      5.4.5.1. ―CONTINUE DRY‖ used to provide clearance to aircraft for dry employment
      during a type 1 or type 2 control.
      5.4.5.2. ―TYPE 3, CONTINUE DRY‖ used to provide clearance to aircraft for dry
      employment within the parameters imposed by the FAC(A)/JTAC during a type 3
      control.
      5.4.5.3. The word "CLEARED", in conjunction with any ground attack commencement
      communication, will only be used when ordnance is actually to be delivered. This will
      minimize the chances of dropping ordnance on dry passes. Non-standard calls must be
      avoided at all times.
5.5. Night Surface Attack Procedures. [AFSOC guidance] (USAF helicopters follow lead
command guidance in AFI 11-2MDS/MAJCOM instruction) See paragraph 3.8 for additional
guidance.
   5.5.1. Night Weapons Deliveries. [AFSOC guidance] At night observe the following
   additional requirements (USAF helicopters follow lead command guidance in AFI 11-
   2MDS/MAJCOM guidance):
      5.5.1.1. Aircraft lighting will be full-up IAW paragraph 3.8.2 unless operating in
      airspace designated for reduced, covert, or lights-out settings. Aircraft operating in
      designated airspace may use lighting options IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3 and any
      applicable waivers.
      5.5.1.2. If conducting training with an RCO/JTAC, the RCO/JTAC must have an
      illumination device to make his/her position readily discernible to NVG-equipped
      aircraft. NVG aircraft will use external lighting that allows the RCO or JTAC to observe
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                        39


     the aircraft in the pattern. If aircraft are employing covertly or with lights out, the
     RCO/JTAC will be properly equipped and trained with NVGs.
     5.5.1.3. Minimum in-flight visibility for visual attacks is 5 NM (3 NM for helicopters).
     5.5.1.4. For visual deliveries, illuminate the target area with airborne flares or ground
     marking devices unless expending on a lighted target (Class A range). Night radar
     bombing, TGP, FLIR, Pave Penny, IR Maverick attacks, NVG, RPAs or B-52 aircraft do
     not require artificial illumination of the target (see paragraph 5.5.3).
     5.5.1.5. Night Class B/C Dry Clearing Pass. Aircrew may perform a combination dry
     FRA, range clearing pass only during a level delivery at an altitude that will allow for
     positive clearing of the range, but no lower than outlined in paragraph 3.8.3
     5.5.1.6. Operate no more than three aircraft, (or four FLIR or NVG-equipped aircraft)
     using Air-Air TACAN, Air-Air radar, or data-links in the same conventional pattern. All
     conventional patterns will provide adequate spacing to allow aircrew to focus primarily
     on aircraft control vice aircraft deconfliction.
     5.5.1.7. Aircrew will not attempt to air score own-ship deliveries.
     5.5.1.8. IR pointer employment. For IR pointer TTPs, reference JP 3-09.3 and AFI 11-
     2MDS. IR pointers referenced in this section are from the Air Force Safety Center’s
     approved laser list as of 14 April 2011. For simplicity, a reference to 'IR pointer' is a
     reference to all devices listed in table 5-1 of this section.
     5.5.1.9. Laser Eye Protection (LEP) with side protection must be worn when employing
     a laser command pointer (LCP) in the cockpit, where a reflection hazard exists, or during
     a ground test.
        5.5.1.9.1. Put on LEP (when required) prior to removing the LCP safety cap.
        5.5.1.9.2. Aircraft commanders/flight leads will confirm LCP employing
        aircrew/flight members are wearing LEP prior to anyone employing an LCP under
        any conditions where a reflection hazard exists.
            5.5.1.9.2.1. Aircrew will notify ground personnel and other aircraft in the
            working area prior to employing IR pointer. For specific missions that require
            minimal/no external comm, pre-mission coordination (when/where IR pointer will
            be used) satisfies this notification requirement. When required, ground personnel
            will ensure proper eye protection is in place.
        5.5.1.9.3. Remove and stow LEP prior to take-off, air-to-air refueling, and landing.
        (Not applicable for aircrew performing in-flight monitor duties)
        5.5.1.9.4. Fixed-wing aircraft will separate themselves from IR pointer employing
        aircraft by the minimum slant range listed in Table 5-1, unless wearing LEP with
        sufficient optical density for that laser. LEP optical density required for each laser is
        listed in its safety approval memo, available from AF Safety Center.
        5.5.1.9.5. Minimum Employment Altitudes and Slant Ranges. If all personnel in the
        area to be designated are wearing LEPs, the minimum IR pointer employment altitude
        is 1,000 feet AGL for fixed-wing aircraft. In this case, there is no minimum altitude
 40                                                             AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012


         for rotary-wing aircraft LCP employment provided the LCP is not pointed toward any
         aircraft, person or reflective surface.
            5.5.1.9.5.1. If non-LEP equipped personnel are in the area to be designated and it
            is verified that no image-magnifying devices (binoculars, telescopes, etc.) are in
            use, minimum IR pointer employment slant range must be the value from Table 5-
            1.
            5.5.1.9.5.2. If non-LEP equipped personnel are in the area to be designated and
            aircrew are unable to ensure the absence of personnel using image-magnifying
            devices (binoculars, telescopes, etc.) in the area to be designator will not be used.

       * When ground parties confirm using LEPs with no image magnifying devices, the
       minimum slant range may be reduced to 1,000 ft.

         5.5.1.9.6. Flight leads will ensure that each flight member verbally confirms IR
         pointers are safe when IR pointer use is terminated for the mission and the safety cap
         (handheld LCP only) is in place.
         5.5.1.9.7. When organizations receive updated information for Table 5-1, Minimum
         Slant Range for Eye-Safe Laser Employment, coordinate a change to this table IAW
         paragraph 1.1.4. and the Air Force Safety Center (AFSEC/SEW).
  5.5.2. Night Visual Weapons Delivery Pattern (N/A for RPA, AFSOC assigned/gained
  aircraft, and aircraft operated under AFSOC lead command guidance and helicopters):
      5.5.2.1. Maximum planned dive angle is 45 degrees.
      5.5.2.2. Minimum downwind altitudes will be 1,500 feet AGL or according to
      paragraph 3.8.3
      5.5.2.3. Aircrew not utilizing TFR will begin their recoveries to ensure that their aircraft
      does not go below the following minimum altitudes:
         5.5.2.3.1. NVG Equipped Aircraft.
             5.5.2.3.1.1. 1,000 feet AGL for planned dive angles up to 45 degrees (HI).
             5.5.2.3.1.2. 1,000 feet AGL or MSA, whichever is higher for planned dive angles
             up to 45 degrees (LI).
             5.5.2.3.1.3. During LI conditions the use of artificial illumination devices (e.g.
             LUU-2, LUU-19, illumination rockets), may allow for use of HI recovery
             altitudes. The flight lead will make this determination based on the ability to
             identify terrain features and/or obstacles in the target area.
         5.5.2.3.2. Non-NVG Equipped Aircraft.
             5.5.2.3.2.1. 2,000 feet AGL or MSA, whichever is higher for planned dive angles
             greater than 20 degrees up to 45 degrees.
             5.5.2.3.2.2. 1,000 feet AGL or MSA, whichever is higher for dive angles of 20
             degrees or less.
  5.5.3. Night System Weapons Delivery Pattern: [AFSOC guidance] A "Night System" is
  a device that allows the aircrew to identify the target when normal visual acquisition is not
  possible.
      5.5.3.1. RPA and aircraft equipped with TGP, FLIR, ground mapping radar, or NVG
      may fly events on class A, B or C ranges.
 42                                                             AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012


      5.5.3.2. Minimum altitude on downwind is 1,500 feet AGL or MSA, whichever is
      higher. Descend to release altitude when established on final. Range operations
      permitting, TF/TA equipped aircraft may operate at AFI 11-2MDS limits.
      5.5.3.3. Minimum spacing between deliveries is 60 seconds. Bomber aircraft, TGP,
      FLIR or NVG equipped aircraft may use daylight rules of minimum spacing when
      operating with an Air-Air TACAN or Air-Air radar.
      5.5.3.4. Maximum angle of bank during TGP recovery maneuvers from a loft or
      climbing safe escape is 135 degrees. Descend no lower than MSA until within TF limits.
   5.5.4. Night Illumination Flare Procedures.
      5.5.4.1. Computations. Plan the minimum altitude for flare release to ensure illumination
      flare burnout before ground impact.
      5.5.4.2. Class B and C Range radio procedures are same as day (see paragraph 5.4).
      5.5.4.3. Dud Flare Procedures. If a dud flare is suspected, cease range operations until
      the flare is no longer a hazard.
      5.5.4.4. Determining Flare Release Points. Determine the release point by using a
      FAC(A)/JTAC, GPS/INS coordinates, radar vector, dead reckoning, computed systems
      Continuously Computer Release Point (CCRP) or by the RCO. If position is uncertain, do
      not attempt a flare release.
      5.5.4.5. Flare Patterns. Flare patterns and procedures are variable. Timing during the
      flight break-up must position the first delivery aircraft on the downwind leg as the flare
      ship releases flares. Make flare drop and ordnance deliveries in any sequence that
      provides continuous illumination of the target area.
      5.5.4.6. Flare Support Aircraft Coordination. Establish positive coordination between
      flare support aircraft, weapons delivery aircraft, and RCOs to ensure a mutual
      understanding and knowledge of the overall operation. Specific briefing items will
      include:
          5.5.4.6.1. Range entry, exit, and deconfliction procedures.
          5.5.4.6.2. Pattern altitude and direction.
          5.5.4.6.3. Expected number of flares dropped on each pass for each different event.
          5.5.4.6.4. Dud flare procedures.
5.6. Live Ordnance Procedures.
   5.6.1. Do not select live ordnance stations until within range boundaries and ready for
   delivery. Do not arm delivery systems unless there is intent to expend and according to
   range procedures.
   5.6.2. Weapons safety footprints and minimum safe distances for personnel from targets will
   be IAW paragraph 5.1.1.7
   5.6.3. Following all live ordnance deliveries accomplish a bomb check and battle damage
   check at the earliest opportunity.
   5.6.4. AGM-65 and AGM-114 Employment.
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                          43


      5.6.4.1. If multiple elements are in the formation, non-firing elements will maintain a
      position clear of the firing element and/or stacked high.
      5.6.4.2. If missile launch has not occurred before reaching minimum range, abort the
      pass.
   5.6.5. For missions falling under the Joint Live Fire Exercise definition in Attachment 4,
   refer to that attachment for additional guidance.
   5.6.6. For employment of live IAMs during CAS, refer to paragraph 5.9 for further
   guidance.
5.7. Operations with Naval Ships. The following additional rules apply during maritime
training when not covered by published joint exercise SPINS. For helicopter shipboard
operations, refer to JP3-04.01, Joint Shipboard Helicopter Operations.
   5.7.1. The following restrictions govern flight in the proximity of non-participating ships:
      5.7.1.1. Do not penetrate a 1 NM bubble vertically or horizontally.
      5.7.1.2. Do not fly more than two aircraft in the immediate vicinity.
      5.7.1.3. Do not perform any provocative or aggressive acts, or any acts which could be
      reasonably perceived as provocative or aggressive.
      5.7.1.4. [AFSOC guidance] Do not expend ordnance within l0 NM.
      5.7.1.5. Limit use of non-participating surface ships to navigation practice setups only.
      Do not use nonparticipating surface ships with heavyweight ordnance on-board.
   5.7.2. Rules during training with participating ships must be IAW pre-briefed naval SPINS
   for the ships concerned. In no case will aircraft penetrate a 500-foot bubble around exercise
   ships.
   5.7.3. During multiple sector attacks, maintain a 1,000 feet minimum altitude differential
   between converging single aircraft. Maintain a 2,000 feet differential between converging
   elements.
   5.7.4. A maximum of two aircraft will engage in near simultaneous attacks (10 seconds
   minimum spacing) on the same target. The second aircraft must maintain visual contact.
   5.7.5. A maximum of four aircraft can attack a single target with a minimum of 20 seconds
   between elements.
   5.7.6. A maximum number of eight aircraft can attack a simulated Surface Action Group
   (SAG) of two or more targets simultaneously.
   5.7.7. The minimum distance between simulated SAG targets is 1 NM for simultaneous
   attacks.
   5.7.8. Aircrew will not attack targets outside their pre-briefed attack quadrant.
   5.7.9. Aircrew will not attack into reflected sunlight.
5.8. Air Strike Control Procedures.
   5.8.1. Air strikes during CAS operations will be conducted in accordance with JP 3-09.3 and
   must be controlled by a qualified FAC(A)/JTAC. Personnel receiving formal FAC(A)/JTAC
44                                                                AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012


  upgrade training or receiving CAS familiarization training require supervision from a
  qualified FAC(A)/JTAC instructor while controlling air strikes in CAS training. All non-
  JTAC qualified personnel are required to identify themselves as non-JTAC qualified to
  aircrew during initial check-in (e.g. ―Hog 01, this is Grunt 69, I am a JFO. I am not JTAC
  qualified.‖). AC-130s do not require FAC(A)/JTAC control, but do require an AC-130 call-
  for-fire qualified individual to be present during CAS training. Non-attack rotary wing
  aircraft (e.g. HH-60, UH-1, CH-47, MH-47) conducting CSAR training do not require
  FAC(A)/JTAC control when supporting calls-for-fire, but do require a call-for-fire qualified
  individual to be present.
     5.8.1.1. JTAC upgrade students controlling CAS assets under the direct supervision of
     JTAC-I are not required to transmit ―I am not JTAC qualified‖ providing aircrew are
     briefed prior to the mission that upgrade student training is taking place.
     5.8.1.2. Partner Nation JTAC/FACs that control air strikes will adhere to JP 3-09.3 CAS
     procedures and must be Certified and Qualified in accordance with the JTAC MOA. Any
     JTAC/FAC that does not have this qualification must be under the direct supervision of a
     US JTAC instructor to control air strikes in CAS training.
  5.8.2. Troop and target identification is critical. All available means (map plot, aircraft
  systems, target mark, target talk-on, etc.) will be utilized to positively identify the target.
  Aircrew and JTACs will ensure the position(s) of friendly forces are deconflicted from
  ordnance footprints before expending IAW paragraph 5.1.1.7
  5.8.3. JTACs shall wear protective gear IAW AFI 13-112 Volume 1.
  5.8.4. Aircraft Deconfliction.
     5.8.4.1. When using altitude deconfliction, the following guidance will apply:
         5.8.4.1.1. A minimum of 1,000 feet vertical separation between altitude blocks is
         required at or above 5000 feet AGL.
         5.8.4.1.2. A minimum of 500 feet vertical separation between altitude blocks is
         required below 5,000 feet AGL.
         5.8.4.1.3. Aircraft will verbally confirm all altitude restrictions.
     5.8.4.2. Aircraft will not transit or exit the assigned altitude, altitude block, or
     deconfliction sector, and will not employ weapons unless cleared or acknowledged by
     FAC(A)/JTAC.
     5.8.4.3. If timing is used for deconfliction, aircrew will inform the JTAC/FAC(A) if
     planned timing will not be met.
     5.8.4.4. In addition to on-board systems and the established deconfliction plan, each
     participant must use ―see and avoid‖ techniques (N/A for RPA’s).
     5.8.4.5. Aircrew will initiate a ―TERMINATE‖ or ―KNOCK IT OFF‖ IAW paragraph
     3.4 criteria if deconfliction is in question.
  5.8.5. JTACs own the final release clearance authority. If JTACs choose to relinquish the
  final release clearance authority (e.g., to FAC(A), etc.), JTACs must ensure that a clear,
  concise, and positive handoff occurs with a current and qualified air/ground controller.
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                      45


   5.8.6. All players have the authority and responsibility to call "KNOCK-IT-OFF" or abort
   the pass if they deem safety to ground crews or other airborne aircraft is in jeopardy.
5.9. Additional Procedures for CAS Operations with Inertially Aided Munitions (IAM).
   5.9.1. General. JTAC/FAC(A) personnel and aircrew will use the following procedures in
   addition to the procedures in JP 3-09.3, local directives, range supplements, and applicable
   11-2MDS during CAS operations with IAMs.
      5.9.1.1. In addition to meeting range, airspace, and theater restrictions, aircrew are
      responsible for system and weapon targeting accuracy IAW paragraph 5.1.1.6.
   5.9.2. Procedures.
      5.9.2.1. Aircrew will receive a CAS 9-line briefing and read back 9-line information
      IAW JP 3-09.3. JTAC/FAC(A)s may request read back of any items.
          5.9.2.1.1. JTAC/FAC(A)s will confirm with the aircrew that WGS-84 is being used,
          what coordinate format is required (e.g., ―latitude/longitude, in degree, minutes, and
          decimal minutes‖), and which elevation format is being used (e.g. Height Above
          Ellipsoid, MSL, meters vs. feet).
5.10. Operations with JSTARS. The following additional procedures apply during Air-to-
Surface missions with JSTARS: (Note: In the absence of JSTARS or other applicable agencies,
AWACS/CRC may conduct C2 of CAS)
   5.10.1. JSTARS has no inherent identification capability. All target identification requires
   off-board cross-cueing.
   5.10.2. JSTARS does not provide positive-radar control of aircraft. JSTARS provides
   procedural control of aircraft using time, altitude, geographic (lateral) separation, and data
   links for aircraft deconfliction. The deconfliction method may be delineated in the ACO,
   SPINS, AFTTP 3-1, General Planning, Attachment 1, or real-time tactical briefs.
   5.10.3. JSTARS will not provide airspace monitoring. Maintaining airspace confines is an
   aircrew responsibility.

                                          Attachment 4
           AIR-TO-GROUND JOINT LIVE FIRE EXERCISE PROCEDURES

A4.1. Joint Live Fire Exercise Operations. This attachment outlines procedures pertinent to
the execution of Joint Live Fire operations. For the purpose of this attachment, Joint Live Fire
Exercise is defined below. These procedures will be applied in addition to the procedures
outlined in Chapter 5. Joint Publication 3-09.3, Close Air Support, AFTTP 3-1.TACS, Theater
Air Control System, and AFTTP(I) 3-2.6, JFIRE Multi-service Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures for the Joint Application of Firepower provide further guidance.
   A4.1.1. General.
       A4.1.1.1. Joint Live Fire Exercise. Defined as CAS/JAAT or FAC(A) sorties flown in
       support of ground or rotary wing maneuver units that involve aircraft dropping, firing,
       and/or expending objects/projectiles. These exercises will involve members of more than
       one service.
       A4.1.1.2. This attachment does not apply to aircraft under the control of a FAC(A)/JTAC
       supporting exercises involving ground or rotary wing aviation units firing from fixed
       positions into an impact area with no other maneuver units involved.
       A4.1.1.3. This attachment also does not apply to aircraft flying under the control of a
       FAC(A)/ JTAC from the same or different service if there are no maneuver units
       involved.
   A4.1.2. Mission Preparation.
       A4.1.2.1. Detailed planning for Joint Live Fire Exercises will be accomplished by the
       common higher headquarters of all the participating units.
           A4.1.2.1.1. The Air Force representative, e.g. Aircrew, FAC(A)/JTAC/ALO, will
           ensure that this planning is consistent with applicable Air Force instructions and
           conforms      to    current   Joint/Air    Force    doctrine.       The      senior
           aircrew/FAC(A)/JTAC/ALO will also be responsible for maintaining a high state of
           situational awareness on the locations of all ground troop positions/ movements
           involved in the exercise.
       A4.1.2.2. Aircrew/FAC(A)/JTAC/ALOs will be prepared to shift to alternate targets or
       abort ordnance delivery if troop location is uncertain or troop movement is within
       minimum safe separation distance from targets.
       A4.1.2.3. All aircrew will receive a comprehensive briefing on the training area. This
       briefing will include, but is not limited to the following:
           A4.1.2.3.1. Expected target location.
           A4.1.2.3.2. Location and planned movement of troops and aircraft.
           A4.1.2.3.3. Approved alternate target locations.
           A4.1.2.3.4. Planned ground fire.
           A4.1.2.3.5. Airspace control measures (phase lines, restricted fire areas, etc.).
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                      65


        A4.1.2.3.6. Abort procedures.
        A4.1.2.3.7. Emergency jettison procedures and areas.
        A4.1.2.3.8. Range restrictions.
        A4.1.2.3.9. Exercise operating procedures.
     A4.1.2.4. If assigned, units will use their Ground Liaison Officers (GLOs) in their
     mission briefings to provide service training objectives and tactical situation information.
     Units without GLOs will obtain tactical situation information from the participating
     service units’ JTAC/ALO.
     A4.1.2.5. Refer to Attachment 3, "CAS Coordination and Briefing Guide"
  A4.1.3. Procedures.
     A4.1.3.1. Aircrew/JTAC/ALO Criteria.
        A4.1.3.1.1. Only CMR/BMC mission-ready aircrew/JTAC/ALOs will participate in
        joint live fire operations. (No MQT Training) (AFSOC CAS platform follow
        command guidance)
        A4.1.3.1.2. Aircrew will be qualified in the weapons delivery events to be flown
        IAW AFI11-MDS Volume 1.
     A4.1.3.2. Minimum Altitudes.
        A4.1.3.2.1. Minimum release and recovery altitudes will be IAW paragraph 5.3.6
        A4.1.3.2.2. Minimum altitude over troops will be 200 feet AGL, minimum aircrew
        qualification, local directive minimums, or airspace coordination minimums,
        whichever is higher.
     A4.1.3.3. Communications and Control Procedures.
        A4.1.3.3.1. The senior JTAC/ALO will ensure continuous communications are
        available between all parties involved in the joint live fire exercise. If two-way
        communication between any parties is lost, all ordnance delivery activities will cease
        until communications are re-established.
        A4.1.3.3.2. The JTAC/ALO will coordinate all fires with the appropriate maneuver
        and fire support unit prior to commencement of an air strike.
        A4.1.3.3.3. The FAC(A)/JTAC/ALO will be positioned to ensure the correct target is
        being attacked and watch for unplanned troop movements beyond planned control
        measures.
        A4.1.3.3.4. If terrain, weather, or other factors restrict the FAC(A)/JTAC/ALOs
        ability to observe and control the exercise, a safety observer will be required.
            A4.1.3.3.4.1. The safety observer will be a FAC(A)/JTAC/ALO with two-way
            radio communication who is in a position to observe the target. The safety
            observer maintains full abort authority and will ensure the correct target is
            attacked while maintaining the safety of ground personnel and equipment.
            A4.1.3.3.4.2. If the safety observer is unable to observe the target, an independent
66                                                                 AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012


             safety observer using a maneuver commander approved automated ground and air
             forces tracking system (e.g., Solaris, AWMDS) with two-way communication to
             all players fulfills this requirement.
         A4.1.3.3.5. All air strikes will be controlled by a current and qualified FAC(A)/JTAC
         who has positive radio communications with each aircraft.
             A4.1.3.3.5.1. The FAC(A)/JTAC will exercise control IAW JP 3-09.3, Close Air
             Support and AFTTP (I) 3-2.6, JFIRE Multi-service Tactics, Techniques, and
             Procedures for the Application of Firepower.
     A4.1.3.4. Troop and target identification is critical. All available means (map plot,
     aircraft systems, target mark, target talk-on, etc.) will be utilized to positively identify the
     target and its relation to friendly forces.
         A4.1.3.4.1. When within 5 km (3 NM) of friendly ground troops, the target will be
         marked by a unique terrain feature, laser, or a conspicuous marking device (i.e., white
         phosphorus rocket, artillery round, smoke grenade, IR pointer, etc.).
         A4.1.3.4.2. Each flight member will acknowledge target identification and direction
         of attack prior to their initial live ordnance pass on the target.
         A4.1.3.4.3. Refer to paragraph 5.9 for additional guidance on CAS operations with
         IAMs.
         A4.1.3.4.4. In order to ensure target/impact area recognition, all pilots will
         accomplish a dry pass using simulated ordnance release parameters prior to the actual
         expenditure of ordnance. This pass will be under the control of a FAC(A)/JTAC.
         Exercise rehearsals conducted up to 48 hours in advance may count as the initial pass
         provided all major participants and parameters remain the same. (N/A for AFSOC).
         A4.1.3.4.5. If friendly maneuver forces are within 5 km (3 NM) of the target, the
         elements closest to the target must be positively identified by the attacking aircraft
         prior to weapons expenditure.
     A4.1.3.5. Air Delivered Ordnance Minimum Safe Distance Criteria. Aircrew and JTACs
     will ensure the position(s) of friendly forces are deconflicted from weapons footprints
     before expending IAW paragraph 5.1.1.7
         A4.1.3.5.1. TACP/JTACs operating at the MSDs listed in AFTTP 3-2.6, JFIRE
         Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for the Application of Fire Power
         are required to wear protective equipment (including eyewear) IAW paragraph 5.8.3
         A4.1.3.5.2. Ground Maneuver units and other personnel in the vicinity of the target
         area will adhere to WDZ footprint distances in paragraph 5.1.1.7
     A4.1.3.6. Weather Minimums. Weather minimums for Joint Live Fire Exercise
     operations will be 2,500 feet ceiling, and 5 miles visibility for aircraft employing visual
     weapons deliveries. For aircraft employing non-visual deliveries, weather minimums
     will be IAW applicable AFI 11-2MDS series instructions.
     A4.1.3.7. USAF personnel may use lasers on foreign and other US service ranges IAW
     AFI 13-212, paragraph 4.11.10.

                         AIR-TO-AIR LIVE FIRE PROCEDURES

A5.1. Aerial Gunnery. The following rules apply to missions involved in live gun firings
against towed targets.
   A5.1.1. General.
      A5.1.1.1. The TRs in this instruction apply with the following additional restrictions:
          A5.1.1.1.1. Implement procedures to ensure the range are clear of surface activity
          and other aircraft before firing over an undercast.
          A5.1.1.1.2. Cease fire if sighting any surface activity or other aircraft in the bullet
          impact area.
          A5.1.1.1.3. A Range Control Officer (RCO) must be present during firing. After
          join-up with the tow aircraft, the engaging flight lead will become the RCO (if
          qualified). A Tow pilot may perform RCO duties (if qualified) when an RCO flight
          lead is not present.
      A5.1.1.2. The Flight Lead and Tow Pilot will:
          A5.1.1.2.1. Ensure firing occurs within the range boundaries.
          A5.1.1.2.2. Ensure the range is clear of surface and other airborne traffic at all times
          during firing.
          A5.1.1.2.3. Ensure TR compliance.
          A5.1.1.2.4. Assess fouls.
      A5.1.1.3. The Tow Pilot will:
          A5.1.1.3.1. If chased, make a warning call before deploying the AGTS.
          A5.1.1.3.2. Fly the pre-briefed pattern.
          A5.1.1.3.3. Initiate radio calls to control the firing sequence.
          A5.1.1.3.4. Establish a turn before issuing a "CLEARED TO FIRE" call.
          A5.1.1.3.5. Record hits for each pass
      A5.1.1.4. The Shooter will:
          A5.1.1.4.1. Monitor the AGTS deployment and notify the tow if any malfunctions
          occur
          A5.1.1.4.2. Not fly directly below or astern the tow aircraft at any time.
          A5.1.1.4.3. Acknowledge all calls from the tow pilot.
          A5.1.1.4.4. Maintain safe separation from the target if the shooter air scores the
          target.
          A5.1.1.4.5. Not make firing passes on a target that rolls in a turn, is flying high on
          the tow, or flying in an erratic manner.
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                       69


         A5.1.1.4.6. Maintain positive overtake and a minimum of 5 degrees angle-off to the
         inside of the target's turn while engaged.
         A5.1.1.4.7. Prepare to avoid target debris that will result from a hit.
         A5.1.1.4.8. Immediately after firing, perform a reposition to get out of the target's
         plane of motion (POM) and avoid a 5-degree cone aft of the target's POM.
         A5.1.1.4.9. Visually inspect all shooter aircraft with another aircraft to search for
         damage at the conclusion of gunnery operations.
     A5.1.1.5. If the shooter requires a chase aircraft, the chase will maneuver as necessary to
     observe the firing distance, effectiveness, and shooter position relative to the gun line of
     fire. The chase will fly a position to avoid target debris and the shooter during post-fire
     reposition maneuvers.
     A5.1.1.6. Fouls. Assess a foul to the aircrew for any of the following conditions:
         A5.1.1.6.1. Firing without a clearance
         A5.1.1.6.2. Firing from outside the turn of the target.
         A5.1.1.6.3. Firing within 1,000 feet of the target.
         A5.1.1.6.4. Flying within 800 feet of the target.
  A5.1.2. AGTS/BANNER Basic Patterns. The following section defines various setups
  available for aerial gunnery training. The pattern selected and the tactics employed should
  meet the training requirements for the individual unit. Ideally, shooters will engage the aerial
  target as a two-ship element if two aircraft are available.
     A5.1.2.1. Combat Pattern (Figure A5.1 & Figure A5.2):
         A5.1.2.1.1. The tow will maintain 300 to 450 KIAS for AGTS and 200-250 KIAS for
         BANNER. The shooters will perform a two-ship front quarter tactical intercept using
         AFTTP 3-1 tactics. Prior to the merge, the RCO will call "Arm Hot" and the
         shooter(s) will arm hot. The altitude separation requirements in paragraph 4.2.11
         apply.
         A5.1.2.1.2. Clearance for the tow ship to maneuver occurs after one of the following
         is met.
             A5.1.2.1.2.1. The tow ship has visual contact with one shooter aft of the tow’s
             3/9 line.
             A5.1.2.1.2.2. The attacking flight leader directs the tow ship to maneuver with a
             ―Merge, Merge‖ call.
             A5.1.2.1.2.3. As briefed by the attacking flight lead.
         A5.1.2.1.3. The tow pilot will issue "Cleared to Fire" after establishing the turn.
         A5.1.2.1.4. Shooter tactics should include simulated missile employment culminating
         in a gun attack on the target, using proper radio terminology and attack procedures.
         Continue attacks until finishing the engagement, time expires, reaching bingo fuel,
         Winchester, or approaching minimums. At this time, initiate a ―KIO, Arm Safe‖ call
 70                                                                AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012


           acknowledged by all players. The tow may not roll out of the turn until all players
           acknowledge the KIO.
           A5.1.2.1.5. Each shooter will ensure that the other attacker is clear of the target
           before shooting. If able, the old attacker should reposition high after firing to avoid
           conflict with the target and the new shooter's attack.
       A5.1.2.2. Butterfly Pattern (Figure A5.3 & Figure A5.4):
           A5.1.2.2.1. Begin the setup with the shooter and the tow flying in a co-altitude, line
           abreast, tactical formation. After the shooter(s) and the tow are ready, the flight lead
           calls "check away," and the aircraft turn 45 degrees away from each other. For the
           BANNER, the tow will maintain 200-250 KIAS and check 30 degrees away; the
           shooters will check away 45 degrees and accelerate.
           A5.1.2.2.2. During the turn away, the RCO will call "Arm Hot" and the shooter(s)
           will arm hot. At the briefed range, the flight lead will call, "Turn in, Fights On." The
           tow will turn into the shooters and reference 90 degrees off of the original heading.
           The shooter(s) will maneuver to the merge with 2000 feet of horizontal and vertical
           separation from the tow until tally both the tow and the target.
           A5.1.2.2.3. After the shooter(s) pass the tow's 3/9 position and the tow begins
           turning, the tow pilot will call, "Cleared to Fire."
           A5.1.2.2.4. The tow will maintain a continuous turn into one of the shooters. If there
           are two shooters, the first shooter will maneuver to a high-angle tracking shot on the
           AGTS/BANNER and then reposition high and outside of the target flight path. The
           second shooter will maneuver to a lower aspect gun attack after the first shooter has
           repositioned clear of the fight. After the second shooter has attempted a gun attack,
           initiate a "KIO" or continue with sequential attacks.
       A5.1.2.3. Perch Pattern (Figure A5.5):
           A5.1.2.3.1. Begin the setup with the shooter 6000 feet behind the tow with a radar
           lock on the AGTS/BANNER (4000 feet radar range) and 10 to 30 degrees of aspect.
           The wingman will be in spread formation with the flight lead.
           A5.1.2.3.2. When all aircraft are ready, the RCO will call ―Arm Hot‖ and shooters
           will arm hot. The AGTS tow should make a "30 seconds" call indicating that the tow
           is accelerating to final towing airspeed and a "10 seconds" call will be made
           indicating that the tow is starting the turn. A "Cleared to fire" call will be made by the
           tow when established in the turn.
           A5.1.2.3.3. Once the setup begins, the fighters will perform sequential attacks against
           the AGTS/BANNER.
A5.2. Live Missile Firing. This section applies to live missile-firing exercises. Pre-deployment
and deployment briefings will cover specific procedures, requirements, and restrictions.
   A5.2.1. Terms Explained.
       A5.2.1.1. Range Safety Officer. The Range Safety Officer is the individual responsible
       for monitoring all parameters of operations safety during live-fire missions. The Range
       Safety Officer normally operates out of Range Control.
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                      71


     A5.2.1.2. Safety Chase. An aircrew member qualified to brief and control live missile
     firing missions. Acts as mission commander for firings.
     A5.2.1.3. ABM/WD. A GCI or AWACS controller who provides mission support
     assistance as dictated by the profile.
  A5.2.2. General. The TRs of this instruction apply with the following additional restrictions
  and requirements:
         A5.2.2.1.1. Dash-34 Checklist items (ground checks)
         A5.2.2.1.2. Pre-range checks
         A5.2.2.1.3. Telemetry procedures
         A5.2.2.1.4. Range procedures
         A5.2.2.1.5. Firing procedures
         A5.2.2.1.6. Launch procedures and parameters.
         A5.2.2.1.7. Debris areas and FOD potential.
         A5.2.2.1.8. Emergency procedures.
     A5.2.2.2. Conduct all missile firings in appropriate Air-to-Air ranges under positive
     radar control. The safety chase will fly a chase formation position with the firing aircraft
     (shooter(s)). Safety chase qualified aircrew may act as safety chase for missiles fired
     from their own aircraft.
     A5.2.2.3. Implement procedures to ensure the range is clear of surface activity and other
     aircraft before firing over an undercast.
  A5.2.3. Arming and De-arming. Follow locally established arming and de-arming
  procedures for live missile firing missions.
  A5.2.4. Firing Procedures.
     A5.2.4.1. All members of the flight will clear the range area visually and check for
     surface activity while in the firing pattern (weather permitting).
     A5.2.4.2. Members of the flight not engaged in firing will fly a position as directed by
     the safety chase or GCI or AWACS director. Conduct the flight to preclude any aircraft
     from entering an area forward of the shooter's 3/9 line within the missile footprint when
     the Master Arm switch is in an armed position. Immediately safe the aircraft weapons
     systems anytime another aircraft moves forward of the shooter's 3/9 line within the
     missile footprint.
     A5.2.4.3. Conduct firings to ensure launch, impact, and missile fallout all occur within
     the range safety footprint.
     A5.2.4.4. After firing a missile, the flight will maneuver as necessary to clear possible
     debris.
     A5.2.4.5. Drone Deconfliction. All mission aircraft own deconfliction responsibility on
     the drone at all times. Maintain 2,000 feet slant range from all drones during presentation.
     Shooters will change positions when cleared by the safety chase.

     A5.2.4.6. The safety chase will advise the ABM/WD upon completion of armament
     safety checks and on clearing the range (if required).
     A5.2.4.7. Even if observing a normal missile launch, visually inspect all shooter aircraft
     with another aircraft to search for damage.
  A5.2.5. Communications. Exercise strict radio discipline to alleviate the risk of confusing
  transmissions. Normally only the ABM/WD, safety chase, shooter, or range safety officer
  will make transmissions. This is not to preclude anyone having knowledge of a dangerous
  situation from transmitting a KIO, cease fire or other appropriate warnings. Establish voice
  communications between the firing flight and range control facility before firing. Shooters
  must acknowledge all radio calls. Along with the radio calls prescribed elsewhere in this
  instruction, use the following transmissions for Air-to-Air Weapons System Evaluation
  Program (Air-Air WSEP) missions:
     A5.2.5.1. ―CLEARED TO PAIR‖: Call transmitted by the safety chase to GCI or
     AWACS director to indicate that the tactical lead has been given to the shooter.
     A5.2.5.2. "COMMIT": Call transmitted by the range safety officer, through GCI or
     AWACS director, to the shooter to intercept the target. This call allows the safety chase
     to issue clearance to arm after establishing formation criteria.
     A5.2.5.3. "ARM HOT": Call transmitted by the safety chase allowing the shooters to
     arm weapons systems. Shooters will not place the Master Arm switch to ARM until
     cleared.
     A5.2.5.4. "BANDIT, BANDIT": Call transmitted by the range safety officer, through
     GCI, to transfer range safety responsibility to the safety chase. The safety chase will clear
     shooters to fire when appropriate.
     A5.2.5.5. "HOSTILE, CLEARED TO FIRE": Call transmitted by the safety chase to the
     individual shooters after meeting all safety conditions and accomplishing all mandatory
     radio calls. This is the only transmission that allows shooters to fire their weapons.
     Clearance to fire is clearance to arm.
     A5.2.5.6. "ARM SAFE": Call transmitted by the safety chase or range control facility.
     This call cancels clearance to fire. Shooters will safe their weapon system but may
     continue to maneuver to launch parameters.
     A5.2.5.7. "CEASE FIRE": Call transmitted by the safety chase or range control facility.
     This call cancels clearance to fire. Shooter may remain armed and continue to maneuver
     to launch parameters.
     A5.2.5.8. "FOX": Call transmitted by the shooter at weapons launch.
     A5.2.5.9. ―FOX, FOX‖: Call transmitted by the safety chase to confirm missile launch.
     A5.2.5.10. "KNOCK IT OFF, ARM SAFE": Call transmitted by the safety chase to
     terminate the engagement and safe the weapons systems following missile flyout. The
     shooter will acknowledge this call, terminate the engagement and safe the weapons
     systems.
  A5.2.6. Abnormal Procedures.
AFI11-214 14 AUGUST 2012                                                                  73


     A5.2.6.1. If required, missiles will be "safe jettisoned" in the range area according to
     locally established procedures.
     A5.2.6.2. Conduct jettison procedures to ensure both launch and missile fallout occurs
     within the range boundary.
     A5.2.6.3. Hung ordnance and misfire procedures will be according to locally established
     procedures.
