parts. Parts may be obtained on a reimbursable basis if excess to operational requirements. The use of Air
Force procured items and spares is authorized according to AFMAN 23-1 10. Each request for replace-
ment parts will include the following statement; “This material is for the ________ Air Force Base Aero

   however, it is advisable to maintain bin cards or other stock records for re-ordering. This also includes
   low cost hardware items such as nuts, bolts, screws, gaskets, lubricants, hoses, etc. Spare parts with a
   fair market value of over $50.00, as well as aviation fuel, aircraft engine oil, and other lubricants, will
   be secured in a decentralized storeroom inventory. Refer to AFMAN 34-214, Procedures for Nonap-
   propriated Funds Financial Management and Accounting, for additional guidance.

2.6. Registering Aircraft. Clubs will use the name of the NAFI as the owner for NAF-purchased air-
craft; the US Air Force as the owner and the club as the operator for HQ AFSVA/SVPAR loaned aircraft.

3.1. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). The purpose of the SOP is to consolidate information on
membership responsibilities, local airfield procedures, and operational restrictions and requirements. As a
minimum, the SOP shall contain items described in Attachment 2. The SOP shall be detailed enough that
a pilot with adequate knowledge of Federal Aviation Regulations and applicable USAF publications can
read the SOP and Pilot Information File (PIF) and havethe information required to safely operate club air-
craft at that location. Federal A viation Regulations and USAF guidan ce will not be re iterated unless
needed for clarification purposes. Items impacting flight operations will be coordinated with the applica-
ble installation operations staff.
     3.1.1. Managers shall publish an SOP approved by the Services commander or division chief, and are
     strongly encouraged to draw upon e xperience from club of ficers, certified flight instructors, mainte-
     nance personnel, and installation advisors.
     3.1.2. M anagers and a ll club certified flight instructors shall mainta in a current paper copy of the
     SOP. Managers will provide a paper copy of the SOP to any member requesting one.

     status page will be provided to all members, certified flight instructors, and maintenance personnel.

3.2. Pilot Information File (PIF). The purpose of the PIF is to make informat ion pertinent for safe
flight, but not yet covered in the SO P, available to pilots. The PIF shal l be a single binder, maintained in
an accessible location, and as a minimum, contain the items listed in Attachment 8.
     3.2.1. Managers shall number each PIF item sequentially by calendar year (03-1, 03-2, etc.) and move
     items of a permanent nature to the SOP.
     3.2.2. Members desiring to exer cise pilot-in-command privileges sh all ensure they have read and
     annotated/acknowledged all current PIF items before flight. Managers will use the automated dispatch
     program (ADP) to track PIF currencies.

3.3. USAF Aero Club Instructor Standardization Guide. The purpos e of the USAF Aero Club
Instructor Standardization Guide is to describe aero club pilot chec kout requirements and standards, pri-
vate pilot training requirements, and proper documentation of pilot tr aining and checkouts. All certified
flight instructors are required to adhere to the guidance provided in this guide.

3.4. Documents and Publications. Clubs shall maintain a reference library of flight planning documents
and publications suited to the club's scope of opera tions, applicable maintena nce manuals, and aircraft

ers shall establish cross-country scheduling and approval procedures, and include those procedures in the
SOP.

3.9. Required Equipment. The PIC shall ensure appropriate survival and safety equipment for the
intended operation area is onb oard the aircraft. Base life support un its shall issue survival equipment if
immediate operational needs do not preclude such use, and shall es tablish appropriate safety procedures
for issued equipment.
     3.9.1. The PIC shall ensure an FAA approved personal flotation device for each occupant is onboard
     the aircraft and readily accessible if the aircraft is operated over water, beyond gliding distance from
     land.
     3.9.2. The PIC shall ensure adequa te tie-down equipment is onboard if landing at an airport without
     tie-down equipment.

3.10. Checklists. Managers shall supply a conso lidated aircraft checklist for each aircraft operated. Use
of the checklist by pilots is mandatory. The checklist shall include the applicable items contained in the
manufacturer's owner's manual; ho wever, if the owner's manual doe s not adequately cover the items

    3.12.4. Pilots who have not made three takeoffs and landings in a particular make and model aircraft
    within the preceding 180 days must accomplish a r ecurrency check and closed book exam for that
    make and model aircraft.
    3.12.5. To exercise PIC privileges in club aircraft at ni ght, pilots must have accomplished at least
    three takeoffs and three landings to a full stop, at night, within the preceding 90 days, in each aircraft
    category and class they wish to fly. If night currency is lost, th e pilot must make three takeof fs and
    landings to a full stop, at night, in each aircraft category and class they wish to fly, with a current and

                                       GRADING PRACTICES

A3.1. Ensure all instructors are grading against a uni form standard and the applicant’ s progress is
assessed against their ability to meet the requireme nts of FAA Practical Test Standards (PTS) for the
desired certificate or rating. Unless waived by HQ AFSVA/SVPAR, the following grades shall be used on
the applicant’s training record.

A3.2. Individual Maneuver/Task Grade
   A3.2.1. P = Proficient. The applicant meets the ap plicable FAA PTS for th e individual maneuver/
   task without intervention or verbal assistance from the flight instructor.
   A3.2.2. S = Safe. While the applicant does not fu lly meet the PTS, they are able to consistently per-
   form the maneuver/task safely, without flight instructor intervention or verbal assistance. The appli-
   cant is cleared to perform this maneuver/task solo.
   A3.2.3. A = Accomplished. Unsafe to perform this maneuver/ta sk solo. The applicant is unable to
   perform the maneuver/task without demonstration, intervention, or verbal assistance from the flight
   instructor, or the applicant's rela tive experience makes it impossible to determine if they could per-
   form the maneuver/task without assistance.
   A3.2.4. D = Demonstrated Only. The flight instructor demonstrated the maneuver/task; however ,
   the student was not allowed to accomplish the maneuver/task. (NOTE: If the instructor demonstrated
   the maneuver/task and then allowed the applicant to perform it, the gr ade shall reflect the applicant's
   performance.)
   A3.2.5.  = Accomplished While Solo. Student pilots will place an individual “" in the appropri-
   ate box to indicate they performed the maneuver one or more times while solo.

A3.3. Overall Grade
   A3.3.1. The following grades will be used to assess the students overall performance for the flight. If
   an applicant receives a grade of below average or below acceptable standards, the chief flight instruc-
   tor shall review the applicant’s performance with their flight instructor prior to the applicant’s next
   flight.
   A3.3.2. 1 = Excellent. The applicant’s performance exceeded expectations, given their phase of
   training, experience, etc.
   A3.3.3. 2 = Above Average. The applicant’s performance was ab ove average, given their phase of
   training, experience, etc.
   A3.3.4. 3 = Average. The applicant’s performance was average, given their phase of training, experi-
   ence, etc.
   A3.3.5. 4 = Below Average. The applicant’s performance was belo w average, given their phase of
   training, experience, etc.
   A3.3.6. 5 = Below Acceptable Standards. The applicant’s performance was below av erage given
   their phase of training, experience, etc.

NOTE: The FAA PTS does not fully cover all maneuvers/tasks; therefore, the chief flight instructor shall
supplement the PTS in instances where the PTS performance level is not specific or adequate.

        that individual would log 2 hours T-3 and 1 hour T-2 time. In ea ch case the total of T -1, T-2,
        and T-3 hours must equal the total time flown.
