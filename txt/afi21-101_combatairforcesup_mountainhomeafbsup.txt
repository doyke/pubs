Device (ATD), if possessed by the squadron. This training event will be accomplished with a
FCF pilot current in the appropriate aircraft and include all elements of an FCF sortie. If an
ATD is not available the training event may be conducted in a dual place aircraft or a single seat
aircraft with chase. The crew member flying with the trainee or chasing the trainee will be FCF
current.
8.16.2.1.12.3.7. (Added) An FCF certification sortie will be flown with a current FCF pilot.
Sortie will be flown in a dual seat aircraft or a single seat aircraft with chase. A grade sheet is
not required for this sortie. FCF pilot flying the checkout sortie will initial the appropriate
section of the FCF checkout checklist. For initial MDS FCF Pilot/WSO certification, the aircraft
will be flown in the applicable MDS TO FCF configuration.

appropriate flying squadron for inclusion in the individual's grade book.
8.16.2.1.13. (Added) FCF crew currency requirements. FCF pilot/aircrew currency is 12
months. Non-current FCF pilots do not perform FCF duties until currency is achieved. To
regain currency, FCF pilots accomplish an FCF in the ATD. If an ATD is not available, FCF
pilot flies an FCF profile. If an FCF pilot has not flown an FCF for more than 14 months, the
initial check-out and annual certification procedures will be re-accomplished. An annual FCF
test and meeting will be held at a time determined by the FCF OIC or FCF manager. Aircrews
unable to attend the meeting will read the meeting notes prior to their next FCF sortie. Aircrews
not accomplishing the test during the annual meeting must complete the test prior to flying an
FCF sortie. Flying an actual FCF updates FCF currency.
8.16.3.6. Debriefing: meet the FCF aircrew in debrief section of the effected squadron. If the
aircraft was a non-release, ensure all discrepancies are documented in the AFTO Form 781A
aircraft forms. If the aircraft is released, ensure the FCF checklist has been filled out properly.
Ensure the FCF checklist is placed in the effected aircraft jacket file.
8.16.5.1. FCF Configuration: All FCF flights will be flown in a clean configuration. CFTs may
remain installed. Once the aircraft has been released, an OCF shall be flown in the configuration
that the anomaly originally occurred. Fly FCF currency flights IAW -6 configuration
requirements, deviations may only be authorized with 366 OG/CC and 366 MXG/CC approval.
8.16.5.1.1. FCFs will be flown with a full load of fuel.
8.16.7. Off-station/deployed FCF procedures:
8.16.7.1. (Added)     Deployed QA inspector will serve as the point of contact for all
deployed/off-station FCFs. The inspector will contact the home station FCF/NCOIC for
guidance and protocol for conducting FCFs.

inspection before depot departure. QA will notify AMU if ballast is required for W&B matters.
9.4.4. Mandatory impound aircraft for inadvertent release or firing of explosive ordnance to
include initiation of any component in an aircrew escape system.
9.4.6.6. Aircraft must be impounded if engine FOD damage is sustained beyond operational
limits from an unknown cause (for investigation purposes). If investigation determines the
aircraft was not the cause of the damage, transfer impoundment to the engine.
9.4.6.6.1. (Added) If the aircraft was impounded for engine FOD damage, and engine is
removed to backshop impound engine for investigative purposes. Draw a red border around the
AFTO Form 350 used to document the discrepancy for engine removal and enter
"IMPOUNDED" in bold red letters on the tag.
9.4.6.8. (Added) Engine vibration or stall. Applies to actual occurrences/pilot reported events.
This does not apply to augmenter blow-out or failure to light. Discrepancies resulting from
engine downloads may be considered for impound.

9.4.12. (Added)      Mandatory impound aircraft and servicing/support equipment when
equipment is suspected of being contaminated.
9.4.13. (Added) Mandatory impound aircraft for smoke in the cockpit.
9.6.1. Designated IO ensures QA inserts Impoundment overprints in the AFTO Form 781As and
CS-26 in front of the forms binder. If IMDS is not available, QA-provided overprint manual
forms entries are acceptable. If overprints are issued, IO will ensure the impoundment and
associated WCEs are loaded in IMDS. A person with the authority to impound equipment signs
the "Discovered By" block. Isolate/cordon aircraft/equipment, by use of cones, ropes, signs or
other method to clearly distinguish impound condition.
9.6.3. Use the QA-provided impoundment worksheet CS 28 or 29 to manage/track actions taken
on engines/support equipment.
9.6.6. IO is the single approval authority for maintenance on impounded equipment. In cases
requiring mishap or reporting, IO will coordinate all actions closely with 366 MXG/CC, 366
FW/SE (Safety), or the interim investigating official. In cases involving mishaps or Operational
Report (OPREP) reporting, IO will only allow maintenance required to safe the equipment and
for investigation purposes. Once safety or the investigating official determines the investigation
is terminated, IO can authorize other maintenance to be performed. IOs will keep a detailed log
on all maintenance actions/plans by using (CS-30). Once aircraft impoundment is cleared by the
releasing authority, IO will place all local check sheets in the aircraft jacket file.
 26 AFI21-101_COMBATAIRFORCESUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFBSUP 10 OCTOBER 2012


9.6.6.1. IO will maintain positive control of potential materiel deficiency exhibits and determine
the need for disassembly, analysis and functional checks of other suspect components. Do not
disassemble or repair materiel deficiency exhibits.

equipment. Keep the number of people authorized to use engine blade blending blue dye to an
absolute minimum, and approved by flight chief or AMU NCOIC/OIC. Keep a letter on file
authorizing individuals to use blue dye in the support section. Note: RSAF does not use blue
dye as it is not a GE requirement.
10.2.1.3. CTK custodian will identify warranted tools and provide directions for replacement.
CTK custodians will establish procedures to ensure replacement by the vendor and to preclude
inadvertent disposal.
10.2.1.4.1. Only personnel on the unit’s spare tool account letter will issue expendable and
consumable hand tools. Replace items on a one-for-one basis. Only authorized personnel will
issue out HAZMATs and other items contained in CTK.
10.2.1.4.2. Tool Replacement Procedures. Only CTK custodians or individuals authorized by
letter may issue spare and consumable tools. Authorize a limited number of personnel, in
writing, to have access to spare and consumable tools. Secure tools at all times. When issuing
spare and consumable tools, use a pen and ink change on the inventory and TAS to reflect a
change in quantity upon tool being placed in service.
10.2.1.5. When mission needs require, the squadron superintendent or production super will
approve and coordinate with the support section (as applicable) to transfer CTKs and equipment
at the job site. The transfer of CTKs or equipment will occur when the following requirements
are met:
10.2.1.5.1. (Added) A Support section representative, shift supervisor, section chief, or pro
super will perform the inventory of the CTK with the outgoing individual and document the
transfer on CAF Form 140, CTK Inventory and Control Log/or AF Form 1297. The incoming
individual will inventory and document CAF Form 140/or AF Form 1297. Exception: A
mobile TAS system is authorized for documentation of accountability and control of on-site

available) filled out by the pilot. Give the debrief sheet to the impoundment official or pro super
after completion.
14.45.5.4. (Added) If required for aircraft departure/suspected departure from flight, the pilot
and FS/DO will review Heads Up Display (HUD) video tape to verify if fault was caused by the
aircraft or if the occurrence was induced/causal from aircraft flight envelope or pilot input. Once
it has been determined that an aircraft departed from flight, a full FCF profile will be required.
Once aircraft passes the FCF profile, it will be flown as an OCF in the original configuration it
departed in, to ensure aircraft is airworthy.
14.45.5.4.1. (Added) If disagreement arises over nature of the occurrence, AMU pro super
will notify 366 AMXS Maintenance Supervision/Operations Officer to coordinate with
appropriate agencies to resolve the issue.
14.45.5.5. (Added) AMU Debrief will enter discrepancy in MIS and aircraft forms after it is
verified. If the discrepancy cannot be verified immediately (through debrief of pilot or pending
tape review), enter the write-up on a RED Dash along with the statement "Pending Tape
Review/Pilot Debrief." If write-up is later determined not be a valid discrepancy/aircraft induced
departure, clear the write-up by the pilot as "Tape Reviewed/Pilot debriefed, no aircraft
discrepancy exists IAW 1F-15E-1." If discrepancy is validated, clear the write-up as
"Discrepancy verified by tape review/pilot debrief, entered on page___, block___," and then
enter the original discrepancy on the next open block of AFTO Form 781A under a RED X.
14.45.5.6. (Added)       Impound discrepancies verified/determined to be aircraft induced
departure from controlled flight or un-commanded input. IO will form a FCDT. Team will
follow guidelines/requirements in (CS-06 and CS-07).
14.45.5.6.1. (Added) AMU pro super will notify MOC for aircraft departures. MOC will run
the checklists to notify appropriate agencies.
14.45.5.7. (Added) Maintain all check sheets utilized under this program in the aircraft jacket
file for a minimum of 2 years. If an aircraft is impounded, the impoundment official will ensure
PS&D receives the check sheets. If the aircraft is not impounded, team chief is responsible to
meet this requirement.
16.1.12. (Added)   AMU personnel will ensure a cockpit FO inspection and vacuum is
accomplished upon each ejection seat removal, prior to installation, and documented in the
aircraft 781A.
16.1.13. (Added) Forecasted egress explosives due time change will be identified by PS&D
and verified through the Egress Section prior to being requisitioned through munitions supply.
Items coming due will be requisitioned by PS&D and issued to the Egress Section the week prior
to scheduled maintenance dates.

are the approved locations for ejection seat maintenance, removals and installations. Raising of
the ejection seat to the maintenance position in other than these locations will not be
accomplished without 366 MXG CC/CD approval.
16.2.1.1. (Added) Egress personnel will not perform maintenance when an aircraft is on jacks.
Egress Final Inspections may be accomplished. Egress/Flight Equipment components will not
be removed.
