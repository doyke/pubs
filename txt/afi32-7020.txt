This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-70, Environmental Quality,
and provides guidance and procedures for executing the Air Force (AF) Environmental
Restoration Program (ERP) within the United States. This Instruction applies to operations,
activities, and installations of the United States Air Force (USAF), which includes the Active Air
Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard (ANG). (For the purposes of this Instruction,
reference to active installations includes Air Force Reserve installations.) The Instruction also
applies to activities at government-owned, contractor-operated facilities and activities at third-
party sites (TPS) where environmental restoration activities are managed by the USAF. The
requirements in this Instruction apply to all ERP activities, regardless of when the contamination
was released or the legal authority driving the activity. New provisions in this Instruction will not
have retroactive application unless otherwise specifically provided. The ERP adheres to the
requirements of the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) as outlined in
Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 4715.7, Defense Environmental Restoration
Program (DERP). Additional guidance for the DERP is provided in Department of Defense
Manual (DODM) 4715.20, Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) Management.
This Instruction may be supplemented at any level, but all supplements that directly implement
this publication must be routed to Headquarters, United States Air Force, Deputy Chief of Staff
for Logistics, Installations & Mission Support - Directorate of Civil Engineers - Facilities,
Environment and Energy Division (HQ USAF/A4CF) for coordination prior to certification and
approval. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
 2                                                                                          AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: incorporating the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) decision to expand the ERP
to include environmental response actions, regardless of the date of release or the legal authority
driving the activity, and the Air Force Secretariat direction to achieve cost and schedule
efficiencies and program effectiveness by implementing a performance-based approach to
environmental restoration as much as feasible, minimize life-cycle costs, and maximize the
reduction of Air Force environmental liabilities. Other changes include tiering of compliance
items IAW AFI 33-360; the addition of sections addressing the Military Munitions Response
Program (MMRP), emerging contaminants, and environmental liabilities; clarifications on
processes and documentation; the shift from MAJCOMs to the Air Force Civil Engineer Center
(AFCEC) for ERP execution; and clarification of the role of risk and the proper selection of
toxicity values throughout the restoration process. This revision does not change the source of
ERP funding for activities within the scope of the ERP.

                                           Chapter 1

                                     PROGRAM SCOPE

1.1. Environmental Restoration Program (ERP). The ERP provides for the environmental
cleanup of contamination whose release is attributable to the Air Force. The Air Force executes
its ERP by planning, programming, and implementing response actions. The Air Force shall
comply with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements in conducting environmental
restoration activities. This Instruction provides guidance on:
   1.1.1. Addressing releases of hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants to the
   environment to protect human health and the environment;
   1.1.2. Correcting other environmental damage (such as damage caused by detection and
   disposal of unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO) on other than operational ranges) that
   creates an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or welfare or to the
   environment; and
   1.1.3. Demolishing and removing unsafe buildings and structures, including buildings and
   structures of the Air Force at sites formerly used by or under the jurisdiction of the Secretary
   of the Air Force.
1.2. ERP Categories. The ERP has three program categories: Installation Restoration Program,
Military Munitions Response Program, and Building Demolition/Debris Removal.
   1.2.1. Installation Restoration Program (IRP).
       1.2.1.1. The IRP covers response actions (i.e., the identification and investigation of
       releases, removal actions and remedial actions, or a combination of removal and remedial
       actions) to address:
          1.2.1.1.1. The release or substantial threat of release of hazardous substances.
          1.2.1.1.2. The release or substantial threat of release of any pollutant or contaminant
          that may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare
          (as defined in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
          Liability Act (CERCLA), Title 42 United States Code (42 USC) Sections (§§) 9601 –
          9675.
          1.2.1.1.3. Petroleum, oil, lubricants (POL). IAW with the DERP, cleanup of POL
          may be addressed as part of the IRP. CERCLA contains a petroleum exclusion, so it
          may not be used to address certain releases of POLs. POL releases may also be
          covered under other applicable authorities consistent with the DERP, such as the
          Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Paragraph 6.h. of DODM
          4715.20, Enclosure 3, contains further information on bulk fuel situations.
          1.2.1.1.4. Hazardous wastes and hazardous waste constituents. (Per 42 USC §
          9601(14))
          1.2.1.1.5. Explosive compounds released to soil, surface water, sediments, or
          groundwater as a result of ammunition or explosives production or manufacturing at
          ammunition plants (which are not “defense sites,” and therefore, are ineligible for
          cleanup under the MMRP).
 8                                                              AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


        1.2.1.2. The IRP also covers response activities to address UXO, discarded military
        munitions (DMM), or munitions constituents (MC) that are incidental to an existing IRP
        site (Note: See ERA, AF Funding Eligibility Guidance to determine whether UXO,
        DMM, and MC are incidental to an IRP site). If necessary, consult with Air Force Legal
        Operations Agency, Environmental Law and Litigation Division (AFLOA/JACE) to seek
        clarification on whether a site falls within this criterion.
     1.2.2. Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP).
        1.2.2.1. The MMRP pertains to munitions response actions that address UXO, DMM, or
        MC at defense sites (i.e., munitions response areas (MRAs)/munitions response sites
        (MRSs)). Defense sites exclude operational ranges, operating storage or manufacturing
        facilities, or facilities that are used for or were permitted for the treatment or disposal of
        military munitions, and locations outside the United States. (Note: It is DOD’s
        interpretation that UXO, as a class, and MC on other than operational ranges, formerly
        referred to as “closed, transferred, or transferring ranges,” may constitute a CERCLA
        “pollutant or contaminant” if it presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to
        public health or welfare. If a UXO is actively managed as a waste (e.g., excavated) for
        treatment (e.g., destruction) due to the UXO’s reactive capability, the UXO may then be
        viewed as a RCRA regulatory hazardous waste and thus also as a CERCLA hazardous
        substance. IAW DODM 4715.20, CERCLA will be the preferred response mechanism
        used to address UXO at other than operational ranges.)
        1.2.2.2. The MMRP may also include response actions to address releases that are
        defined in paragraph 1.2.1, but are incidental to addressing an existing MRS. (Note: See
        ERA, AF Funding Eligibility Guidance to determine whether releases defined in
        paragraph 1.2.1. are incidental to an MMRP site.)
     1.2.3. Building Demolition/Debris Removal (BD/DR). The BD/DR program provides for the
     demolition and removal of unsafe buildings and structures at facilities or sites that are or
     were owned by, leased to, or otherwise possessed by the United States and under the
     jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Air Force. There are significant restrictions on the
     availability of ERA and Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Account funds for BD/DR;
     the Air Force must have DUSD(I&E) approval of any request prior to programming funds.
     See Paragraph 3.c. of DODM 4715.20, Enclosure 3, for more information.
1.3. Former Air Force Properties. Environmental restoration requirements associated with
Air Force real property, where the property transferred from the Air Force and the release
occurred prior to October 17, 1986, are generally the responsibility of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) as part of the Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS) Program. If extenuating
circumstances warrant continued Air Force involvement at the site, the AFCEC Environmental
Restoration Division (CZR), AFCEC Installations Directorate (CI), or the National Guard
Bureau, Installations and Mission Support Directorate, Operations Division (NGB/A7O), as
appropriate, must submit justification to HQ USAF/A4CF for authorization to use Air Force
obligation authority. Once the Air Force elects involvement with property that was transferred
prior to October 17, 1986, the property may not later be turned over to the FUDS program. The
Air Force retains responsibility for former properties not eligible for the FUDS program. Consult
legal counsel to determine the extent of Air Force responsibilities.
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                        9


1.4. Legal Authorities. 10 USC §§ 2700 – 2711, otherwise known as the DERP is the statutory
authority that establishes an environmental restoration program of hazardous substances,
pollutants and contaminants for DOD. Environmental restoration at Air Force installations for
restoration conducted pursuant to CERCLA is conducted under DERP subject to, and in
accordance and consistent with CERCLA requirements, with the Air Force as the lead agency.
The Air Force conducts environmental restoration of hazardous substances, pollutants and
contaminants primarily IAW CERCLA; it may also conduct restoration activities under RCRA
and other applicable Federal, state, or local requirements. Regardless of the legal authority for
performing environmental restoration, the processes are substantively similar. Attachment 2
depicts the typical steps in CERCLA response actions and the corresponding activities required
by CERCLA or RCRA corrective action.
   1.4.1. CERCLA, 42 USC §§ 9601 et seq. CERCLA and its implementing regulation, Title
   40, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 300, National Oil and Hazardous Substances
   Pollution Contingency Plan, commonly called the National Contingency Plan (NCP), apply
   to most restoration activities. Executive Order (EO) 12580, Superfund Implementation, as
   amended by EO 13016, Amendment to EO 12580, delegates authority and responsibility to
   the Secretary of Defense (re-delegated to the Secretary of the Air Force) to respond to
   releases or threatened releases “where either the release is on or the sole source of the release
   is from any facility or vessel under the jurisdiction, custody, or control” of the Air Force. The
   Air Force is the “lead agency” with delegated authority to plan and implement response
   actions under CERCLA and the NCP (see paragraph 8.2).
   1.4.2. DERP, 10 USC §§ 2700-2711. 10 USC § 2701(a) states “The Secretary of Defense
   shall carry out a program of environmental restoration at facilities under the jurisdiction of
   the Secretary.” The scope of the DERP is defined in 10 USC § 2701(b), which states “Goals
   of the program shall include the following: (1) identification, investigation, research and
   development, and cleanup of contamination from hazardous substances, pollutants or
   contaminants; (2) correction of other environmental damage (such as detection and disposal
   of UXO) which creates an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or
   welfare or to the environment; (3) demolition and removal of unsafe buildings and structures,
   including buildings and structures of the DOD at sites formerly used by or under the
   jurisdiction of the Secretary.”
       1.4.2.1. Under 10 USC § 2701(a)(2) and (c)(1), response actions (i.e., site identification,
       investigation, removal actions, remedial actions, or a combination of removal and
       remedial actions) taken under the DERP to address releases of hazardous substances,
       pollutants or contaminants (as defined under CERCLA) shall be carried out subject to,
       and in a manner consistent with, 42 USC § 9620.
       1.4.2.2. Response actions to correct “other environmental damage (such as the detection
       and disposal of UXO) that poses an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public
       health or welfare or to the environment” shall normally be conducted IAW CERCLA, EO
       12580 as amended by EO 13016, and the NCP.
       1.4.2.3. Demolition and removal of unsafe buildings and structures are not subject to
       CERCLA unless the demolition or removal involves the need for, or is an integral part of,
       a response action to address releases to the environment of CERCLA hazardous
10                                                           AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


     substances, pollutants or contaminants that pose an imminent and substantial danger to
     public health or welfare or the environment.
     1.4.2.4. 10 USC § 2710(a) requires the Secretary of Defense to develop and maintain an
     inventory of defense sites known or suspected to contain UXO, DMM, or MC. 10 USC §
     2710(c) requires the Secretary of Defense to annually review and update the inventory
     and site prioritization list, as necessary, to reflect new information that becomes
     available. The inventory shall be available in published and electronic form.
  1.4.3. RCRA, 42 USC §§ 6901 et seq. RCRA has “corrective action” authorities in 42 USC
  §§ 6924(u) and (v), and 6928(h). These authorities require cleanup of certain releases of
  hazardous wastes or hazardous constituents at installations with a hazardous waste treatment,
  storage, and disposal unit (either under a RCRA permit or interim status). These authorities
  potentially extend beyond the specific unit used to treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste
  to the entire contiguous installation property under Air Force control, as well as releases that
  migrate beyond the facility boundaries. Corrective action obligations exist for areas that are
  either a Solid Waste Management Unit at a permitted facility or a regulated unit at an interim
  status facility. Most states have been authorized and delegated by EPA to be the lead
  regulator for RCRA implementation (a few have not been delegated corrective action
  oversight, but otherwise have delegated authority over RCRA); thus similar state laws must
  be consulted. In addition, the “imminent and substantial endangerment authority” of 42 USC
  § 6973 allows EPA to require such action as necessary to abate an imminent and substantial
  endangerment from the handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid
  or hazardous waste.
  1.4.4. CERCLA/RCRA Integration. When both CERCLA and RCRA apply, the Air Force
  shall ensure that response actions (under CERCLA) or corrective action (under RCRA) are
  IAW the following authorities and principles:
     1.4.4.1. Action under one program should satisfy the substantive requirements of the
     other. This is consistent with EPA’s policy that there should be parity between RCRA
     corrective action and CERCLA programs, each of which should generally yield similar
     substantive remedies in similar circumstances. See Office of Solid Waste and Emergency
     Response (OSWER) Directive 9272.0-22, Improving RCRA/CERCLA Coordination at
     Federal Facilities, for additional information.
     1.4.4.2. Because of the authority described in 10 USC § 2701(a)(2) and (c)(1), the Air
     Force’s “lead agency” status under CERCLA, and CERCLA’s provisions for recognizing
     applicable requirements from other laws, the Air Force prefers to follow the CERCLA
     framework for environmental restoration. Thus, in general, it seeks to implement
     CERCLA responses that integrate or incorporate RCRA substantive requirements,
     thereby satisfying its RCRA obligations through CERCLA responses.
     1.4.4.3. The Air Force works with regulators to identify the appropriate regulatory
     framework to guide the environmental restoration process at an installation if the
     framework has not already been selected. This framework should remain generally
     consistent throughout the environmental restoration process.
  1.4.5. Environmental Restoration under State Response Laws. At all installations, the Air
  Force must comply with state substantive laws. At non-NPL installations, 42 USC §
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                  11


  9620(a)(4) also mandates that Federal agencies’ CERCLA response actions must comply
  with applicable state response laws, as long as such state laws apply requirements to the Air
  Force that are no more stringent than those applied to other entities/persons.
  1.4.6. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 USC §§ 4321 et seq. Relying on a
  United States Department of Justice (DOJ) opinion in a different context, DOD has
  determined that NEPA does not apply to those response actions that fully comply with
  CERCLA and the NCP. Therefore, the Air Force is not required to comply with NEPA
  process requirements when undertaking a response action that complies with the DERP,
  CERCLA, and the NCP. The Air Force will achieve the overall NEPA mandate for a fully-
  informed and well-considered decision that includes consideration of alternatives and
  environmental impacts through adherence to the DERP, CERCLA, and NCP processes (to
  include coordination with applicable installation organizations, as required). Similarly, the
  RCRA corrective action process should integrate formal consideration of diverse
  environmental factors and meaningful opportunities for public involvement such that a
  separate NEPA evaluation is not required. This may require including a public comment
  period during remedy selection if one is not provided under applicable state RCRA
  procedures. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, and NGB/A7O shall
  consult with legal counsel on questions concerning the scope of a NEPA exemption for
  restoration actions.
  1.4.7. Atomic Energy Act (AEA), 42 USC §§ 2011 et seq. The Air Force manages
  radioactive materials under the AEA, as amended in the Nuclear Regulatory Legislation
  110th Congress; 2d Session (otherwise known as “NUREG-0980”). Defense weapons grade
  nuclear materials are handled under 42 USC § 2121(b) (otherwise known as section 91(b) of
  the AEA).
     1.4.7.1. The Air Force Safety Center (HQ AFSEC) should be consulted on all issues
     involving the handling or transport of 91(b) material. All other uses of radioactive
     materials are regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) through a license
     procedure. The United States Air Force Radioisotope Committee, pursuant to authority
     set forth in AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force, is the
     point of contact for all radioactive materials owned by the Air Force under the Air Force
     Master Materials License and Letter of Understanding the Air Force has with the NRC.
     1.4.7.2. Depending on the factual circumstances of each site where response actions
     concerning radioactive material are contemplated (notwithstanding that the NUREG-
     1575, Rev. 1, Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual (MARSSIM)
     is the basic rule book), requirements under CERCLA or RCRA may also apply. The
     appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, and NGB/A7O should consult with
     SAF/GCN or AFLOA/JACE regarding legal questions related to radioactive materials.
  1.4.8. Environmental contamination outside the United States. When conducting remediation
  of environmental contamination outside the United States, Air Force personnel overseas will
  comply with DoDI 4715.08, Remediation of Environmental Contamination Outside the
  United States, its subsequent implementing Air Force instruction, applicable Unified
  Combatant Command directives, DOD Lead Environmental Component policy, and any
  specific obligations stemming from a binding international agreement.
 12                                                           AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


                                           Chapter 2

                                  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES

2.1. Mission. The ERP mission is to protect human health and the environment, and comply
with all applicable statutory, regulatory and other requirements. The Air Force shall achieve cost
and schedule efficiencies and program effectiveness by implementing a performance-based
approach to environmental restoration as much as feasible, minimize life-cycle costs, and
maximize the reduction of Air Force environmental liabilities. Restoration activities will be
planned, programmed, budgeted, and executed to optimize the Air Force’s investment and
appropriately mitigate and apportion risk.
2.2. Operating Principles
   2.2.1. All environmental restoration activities shall comply with the DERP statutory
   requirements of 10 USC §§ 2700 – 2711 and with all other applicable laws, regulations, and
   formal agreements (e.g., Federal Facility Agreements (FFA)). The Air Force shall implement
   the DERP consistent with related OSD and Air Force Departmental Directives, issuances,
   policy, and guidance.
   2.2.2. In addition to complying with 10 USC §§ 2700 – 2711, the Air Force shall protect
   human health and the environment generally by exercising those Presidential authorities
   under 42 USC §§ 9601 through 9675 delegated to the Secretary of Defense under EO 12580
   and EO 13016, and IAW 40 CFR Part 300 (the NCP).
   2.2.3. Cleanup efforts should focus on the most effective and efficient approach to achieve
   results allowing unlimited use and unrestricted exposure, if cost effective from a life cycle
   cost standpoint. If cost-benefit analysis demonstrates the incremental costs are too high to
   achieve unlimited use and unrestricted exposure standards, only then should current and
   reasonably anticipated future land use be considered when selecting response actions. On
   properties slated for disposal (excess or BRAC), all reasonable efforts should be made to
   minimize long-term cleanup responsibilities and associated costs to the greatest degree
   feasible (for example, by cleaning up to unlimited use and unrestricted exposure standards; or
   transferring cleanup responsibilities together with the real property interest; or by negotiating
   a privatized cleanup).
   2.2.4. All major environmental restoration decisions should be risk-based to the maximum
   extent authorized by legal or regulatory regime(s) under which the cleanup is being
   conducted. This includes, but is not limited to, the choice of remedial investigation design
   elements or its counterparts, determinations that action is necessary to address unacceptable
   risk to human health or the environment, and cleanup levels to be achieved when action is
   necessary.
   2.2.5. The ERA, AF (established in 10 USC § 2703(a)(4)) and Air Force BRAC account
   (established in sections 2906 of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, 10
   USC § 2687 note), are the sole sources of funding for environmental restoration activities
   irrespective of the statutory authority governing the activity or the date of release of
   contaminants. Environmental restoration activities at active installations eligible for ERA,
   AF funding are addressed in the ERA, AF Funding Eligibility Guidance. (Note: Exception to
   ERA, AF Funding. There are several specially created accounts or provisions in real property
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                       13


   leasing or transfer laws that allow alternate sources of funding or means to obtain
   environmental restoration services. For example, 40 USC § 572(b)(5)(A) and (B) allow a
   portion of the proceeds from the sale of military installation real property owned by the
   United States to be available to pay for environmental restoration in some circumstances. 10
   USC § 2667(c)(1)(A), provides that restoration may be provided as in-kind consideration
   under certain leases. 10 USC § 2667(e)(1)(C) provides that, under certain conditions, money
   rental proceeds from the lease of military property may be available to pay for environmental
   restoration of military property or facilities. In addition, under some circumstances, a military
   construction project may assume the costs of responding to contamination.)
   2.2.6. Environmental restoration personnel must:
       2.2.6.1. Protect human health and the environment.
       2.2.6.2. Develop and evaluate response alternatives as prescribed in 40 CFR §
       300.430(e).
       2.2.6.3. Ensure that the alternatives evaluation considers, and incorporates to the
       maximum extent practicable, the energy, environment, and economic considerations in
       EO 13423, Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation

AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    31


   5.2.5. Ensure restoration contracts require submission of analytical data as appropriate into
   ERPRIMS.
   5.2.6. Annually certify to HQ USAF/A4CF that restoration contracts and task/delivery
   orders contain the requirement to submit sampling data to ERPIMS in a timely manner.
   (Timely submission refers to the time between the actual sampling event and the ERPIMS
   data submission as stated in contracts and task/delivery orders.)
   5.2.7. Annually report to HQ USAF/A4CF the installations not submitting data within the
   specified contractual time frame, or submitting no ERPIMS data as required.
   5.2.8. Report or disseminate ERP information, to include but not limited to:
       5.2.8.1. When reporting releases of hazardous substances pursuant to CERCLA, 42 USC
       § 9603(a) and 40 CFR Part 302.4, and releases of regulated substances (oil and hazardous
       substances) under the UST rules (40 CFR Part 280.50), AFCEC/CZO or AFCEC/CIB (as
       appropriate), in coordination with the Installation Commander, shall designate a
       government spokesperson at active installations and BRAC locations, and the Installation
       Commander will make the designation at ANG facilities. (T-0).
       5.2.8.2. When conducting a removal action under CERCLA, AFCEC/CZO or
       AFCEC/CIB (as appropriate) shall, in coordination with the Installation Commander,
       designate a government spokesperson at active installations and BRAC locations, and the
       Installation Commander will make the designation at ANG facilities. (T-0). The
       spokesperson shall inform the community of actions taken, respond to inquiries, and
       provide information concerning the release. The spokesperson, with assistance from the
       installation public affairs office, shall notify (at a minimum) immediately affected
       citizens, state and local officials, and when appropriate, civil defense or emergency
       management agencies. The installation public affairs office will coordinate news releases,
       media and public inquiries, and public statements with the spokesperson, Installation
       Commander, AFCEC, and/or NGB, as appropriate.
       5.2.8.3. Requirements to report the discovery of previously unknown releases are often
       elements of FFAs (for installations on the NPL) or other cleanup agreements, RCRA
       permits (where ERP activities are occurring at an installation with a RCRA permit), or
       Administrative Orders (e.g., at an installation operating under an Administrative Order
       under RCRA § 3008 (h)(42 USC § 6928(h)). The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s),
       AFCEC/CIB, or NGB/A7O, as applicable, must report such discoveries IAW the existing
       FFA, permit, order, or other relevant legal authority. (T-0).
5.3. Quality Assurance. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB and NGB/A7O
will comply with DODI 4715.15, Environmental Quality Systems, when collecting, managing,
and using environmental data. (T-0). For environmental sampling or testing services procured
by, or on behalf of, the Department of Defense, the DOD Components shall follow part 223 of
the DOD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, Procedures, Guidance, and Information to
the DOD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, Acquisitions Involving Environmental
Sampling or Testing Services.

                                              Chapter 6

                         PRIORITY SETTING AND SEQUENCING

6.1. Priority Setting
   6.1.1. Priority setting for ERA, AF funded environmental response activities is based on a
   relative evaluation of the hazards posed by specific conditions at a site and is accomplished
   using program category-specific tools.
       6.1.1.1. In the IRP, priorities are assigned using the Relative Risk Site Evaluation
       (RRSE) framework, a prioritization tool that assigns each site to a risk category relative
       to other sites in the IRP (see DUSD(ES) Relative Risk Site Evaluation Primer and the
       AFCEC Program Requirements Development Guide).
       6.1.1.2. In the MMRP, relative priorities are assigned using Title 32 CFR, Part 179,
       DOD Munitions Response Site Prioritization Protocol.
       6.1.1.3. Priority setting for sites that are transferring from Air Force control may also be
       affected by other factors such as reuse priority, or actions needed to transfer property.
6.2. Sequencing. When making sequencing decisions (i.e., decisions regarding whether to fund
response activities at a particular site in a given FY), the Air Force considers both the relative
hazards posed by site conditions and other factors of management significance. Whenever
possible, sequencing decisions shall accelerate responses to achieve established program goals or
mission requirements in advance of the stated date for each goal. Sequencing does not change a
site priority based on risk; however, sequencing a lower risk site before a higher risk site requires
appropriate documentation. In making sequencing decisions, the Air Force will consider various
factors, as appropriate, including but not limited to:
   6.2.1. Implementation and execution considerations (e.g., the availability of the necessary
   systems to implement a particular action, responses that require significant capital
   investments, a lengthy period of operation, or costly maintenance).
   6.2.2. Economic considerations, including economies of scale, evaluation of the total life-
   cycle cost of a remedy, and evaluation of long-term liabilities.
   6.2.3. Mission requirements, both current and reasonably anticipated.
   6.2.4. The relative risk posed among sites.
   6.2.5. The findings of health, safety, or ecological risk assessments or evaluations based on
   site-specific data.
   6.2.6. Concerns expressed by stakeholders.
   6.2.7. Current land use and the reasonably anticipated future land use.
   6.2.8. Property transfer considerations.
   6.2.9. Legal, statutory, or regulatory drivers.
   6.2.10. Short-term and long-term ecological effects and environmental impacts in general,
   including injuries to natural resources.
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    33


   6.2.11. Actual and anticipated funding levels.
6.3. Project Scheduling
   6.3.1. Project scheduling differs from site sequencing. Site sequencing involves decisions
   about when the Air Force will fund ERP activities at a particular site. Project scheduling
   involves the Air Force’s plan for work to be performed at ERP sites after the project has been
   funded.
   6.3.2. Each site must continue to be tracked individually with respect to reporting module
   data on site status, CTC estimate, and schedule-to-complete (STC) estimate, and must be
   addressed as an individual site in the installation’s MAP.
6.4. Construction At or Near Contaminated Sites. To the extent that a construction project
(MILCON or non-MILCON) generates actions to address contamination, or a need to change
ERP-generated timing actions to address contamination, the costs of such actions are not ERA
eligible and shall be funded as part of the construction project. This includes the handling,
mitigation, and disposal or other disposition of contamination discovered before or during the
construction activity.

                                            Chapter 7

                     MILITARY MUNITIONS RESPONSE PROGRAM

7.1. General. The unique health and safety hazards associated with UXO, DMM, and MC may
require installations to restrict access to MRSs. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s),
AFCEC/CIB and NGB/A7O shall ensure compliance with program requirements, to include
notifying the Installation Commander and other relevant base offices throughout this process. (T-
0).
7.2. Air Force Property. For sites managed or administratively controlled by the Air Force, the
appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB and NGB/A7O shall evaluate the MRS
location and condition, and implement protective measures to ensure the health and safety of
military personnel, dependents, contractor personnel, and the public. (T-0). This includes taking
actions as described in DOD 6055.09-M, DOD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards,
Volume 7, paragraph V7.E4.2.3.
7.3. Non-Air Force Federal Property. On discovery of live munitions on a potential MRS on
non-DOD Federal property, the Air Force or the property owner shall immediately notify the
closest DOD military Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit for emergency response. (see
AFJI 32-3002, Interservice Responsibilities For Explosive Ordnance Disposal, AFI 32-3001,
Responsibilities For Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Program, AFPD 10-8, Defense
Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA), and AFI 10-801, Defense Support of Civil Authorities
(DSCA), for more information.) If the responsible official for the non-DOD agency has not
reported the discovery of the live munitions and it is not possible to quickly ascertain who the
responsible official is, the Air Force must report the live munitions to the local EOD unit. Within
5 days of discovering a potential MRS, the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB or
NGB/A7O shall send written notification to the head of the appropriate local office of the
responsible agency. (T-0). The notification should:
   7.3.1. Provide information on known or suspected conditions at the potential MRS.
   7.3.2. Request copies of any applicable documents the responsible agency may possess
   related to the property, especially documents related to transfer of the property from previous
   Air Force management or control to assist in determining appropriateness of creating a new
   MRS (i.e., confirmation that the site is Air Force MMRP eligible and not a FUDS).
   7.3.3. Provide the current owner with information on potential safety, health, or
   environmental hazards associated with the presence of UXO, DMM, or MC to aid the owner
   in making informed decisions on land use and access.
   7.3.4. Strongly urge the responsible agency to take swift action to prohibit access to the
   potential MRS.
   7.3.5. Identify a point of contact (POC) at the Air Force installation who the responsible
   agency can contact regarding UXO-related incidents at the potential MRS.
   7.3.6. Propose a means of communication (e.g., meetings, newsletter) to provide updates on
   the status of munitions response activities planned if the potential MRS requires further
   action.
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                      35


7.4. Non-Federal Property. As soon as possible, but not later than 5 days after discovering a
potential MRS on non-Federal property, the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB or
NGB/A7O shall send written notification to the current owner. (T-0). Discovering live munitions
on a potential MRS requires immediate notification and action by the Air Force or the property
owner (i.e., notification to the nearest military EOD unit for emergency response). If the property
owner has not reported discovering the live munitions and it is not possible to quickly ascertain
who the owner is and/or how they can be contacted, the Air Force must report the live munitions
to the local EOD unit. The notification sent to the land owner should:
   7.4.1. Provide information on known conditions at the potential MRS.
   7.4.2. Request copies of any applicable documents the agency or entity in possession of the
   property may have related to the property, especially documents related to the transfer of the
   property from Federal ownership or control, as appropriate, to assist in determining
   appropriateness of creating a new MRS (i.e., confirmation the site is Air Force MMRP
   eligible and not a FUDS).
   7.4.3. Provide the current owner with information on potential safety, health, or
   environmental hazards associated with the presence of UXO, DMM, or MC to aid the owner
   in making informed decisions on land use and access (e.g., urge the property owner to restrict
   access).
   7.4.4. Request that the owner provide the Air Force with a real property interest (e.g., an
   access easement) that allows the Air Force to access the MRS and that allows the Air Force
   to prohibit or restrict other parties from accessing the site if the Air Force does not already
   have such access.
   7.4.5. Identify an Air Force POC who the responsible agency can contact regarding UXO-
   related incidents at the potential MRS.
   7.4.6. Propose a means of communication (e.g., meetings, newsletter) to provide updates on
   the status of munitions response activities planned for the MRS if the potential MRS requires
   further action.
7.5. Documentation Requirements. A copy of relevant documents shall be entered and stored
in EESOH-MIS or IIT.
7.6. Geophysical Sensor Data. For MMRP geophysical sensor data requirements, see
paragraph 12.3.8.

                                           Chapter 8

                             REGULATORY INVOLVEMENT

8.1. General
   8.1.1. The roles of Federal, state, or local regulatory agencies involved at an environmental
   restoration site largely depend on the legal framework under which the cleanup is conducted
   and whether or not the installation is on the NPL.
   8.1.2. DERP requires that EPA and appropriate state and local authorities be provided
   prompt notice of: the discovery of releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances;
   the associated extent of the threat to public health and the environment; proposals to carry
   out response actions to address the release(s) and the initiation of such actions. They must be
   given adequate opportunity for comment on notices and timely review and comment after the
   proposal and before commencement of action.
   8.1.3. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB and NGB/A7O, in consultation
   with AFLOA/JACE, shall work with regulators to establish the legal framework under which
   the cleanup shall be conducted at a particular installation. (T-1). Evaluate and compare
   regulatory requirements applied to environmental restoration activities with those applied to
   restoration activities conducted by other parties in that state or region to ensure parity of
   requirements.
8.2. Lead Regulators
   8.2.1. NPL Installations. At Air Force installations on the NPL, EPA is the lead regulator
   and the Air Force is the lead agency. CERCLA provides EPA with joint remedy selection
   authority at NPL facilities. If the Air Force and EPA cannot reach agreement, EPA solely
   selects the remedy. CERCLA also requires the Air Force to enter into an IAG with EPA at
   NPL facilities. An FFA is used for DOD NPL facilities to satisfy the CERCLA IAG
   requirement. FFAs outline the working relationship between the Air Force, EPA, and as
   appropriate, the affected state, and clearly define mutual obligations during the cleanup
   process at a DOD NPL facility. (See paragraph 13.1. for more information on FFAs). The
   appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, and NGB/A7O shall consult Air Force
   legal counsel if there is no FFA or IAG for an installation, or if there are stakeholder efforts
   to list sites or an installation on the NPL. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s),
   AFCEC/CIB, and NGB/A7O shall work with regulators to achieve remedial action objectives
   and seek removing an installation from the NPL. For transferring installations, EPA must
   determine whether remedies are operating properly and successfully prior to property
   transfer, and EPA must approve, with state concurrence, requests for early transfer. (For
   more information see DODM 4165.66, Base Redevelopment and Realignment Manual,
   DODI 4165.72, Real Property Disposal, Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense
   for Installations and Environment Guide, Early Transfer Authority: A Guide to Using ETA to
   Dispose of Surplus Property.)
   8.2.2. Non-NPL Installations. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, and
   NGB/A7O should identify a single lead regulator for installations that are not on the NPL.
   For restoration activities conducted under RCRA, if a state has been delegated RCRA
   authority for corrective action, the state usually serves as the lead regulator. Regardless, the
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                        37


   Air Force must notify and provide the applicable regulatory agency review and comment
   opportunities at discrete cleanup stages as noted in paragraph 8.1.2. For property to be
   transferred to non-federal entities and where remediation is ongoing, EPA must determine
   whether remedies are operating properly and successfully prior to property transfer. For early
   transfer, a state governor approves the request.
8.3. State, Territory, and Local Involvement
   8.3.1. States, territories, and local governments have a significant role in the cleanup
   process. 42 USC §§ 9620(f) and 9621(f) and 10 USC § 2705(a) and (b) provide stakeholders
   notice, review, and comment opportunities at each distinct phase of the response process.
   Under the NCP, state acceptance is one of the modifying criteria for evaluation of
   alternatives for the remedial action. States are often parties to IAGs and FFAs at installations
   on the NPL, which may also grant them particular rights to participate in the response
   process. Also see paragraph 11.4.
   8.3.2. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, and NGB/A7O shall work in
   consultation with AFLOA/JACE prior to working with state and/or Federal regulators to
   determine the appropriate Federal or state legal authority(ies) under which environmental
   restoration will be conducted. For cleanups conducted under CERCLA, the Air Force shall
   provide state, territorial, and local governments with notice and review and comment
   opportunities at each distinct phase of the cleanup process. For cleanups conducted under
   legal authorities other than CERCLA, usually RCRA corrective action, consult legal counsel
   on the appropriateness of the alternate mechanism, the procedures that apply, and who
   approves the Air Force restoration activities (normally, the state is the lead regulator for
   RCRA corrective action but not always). If more than one regulatory regime will apply to
   restoration on a single installation, the installation will need to document which activities fall
   under which regimes. See paragraph 13.4 for requirements for executing cleanup under other
   legal authorities.
   8.3.3. Reimbursement for State Support Services.
      8.3.3.1. DSMOA. For environmental restoration activities conducted using ERA, AF or
      BRAC funds, the Air Force reimburses eligible expenses to participating state and
      territorial regulatory agencies through the DSMOA and Cooperative Agreement (CA)
      processes. USACE is the DSMOA lead agent for DOD and administers DSMOAs and
      CAs with participating states and territories. The Air Force is responsible for providing
      and revising JEPs; concurring on states’ proposed work to support an installation’s ERP;
      reviewing costs invoiced by the states for allowable, authorized, and eligible expenses;
      reviewing work plans, documents, and progress reports; and providing funds. Consult the
      DSMOA Cooperative Agreement Program Guide, Working Together to Achieve
      Cleanup: Guide to the Cooperative Agreement Process, for additional information. Also
      see DODM 4715.20, paragraph 15.b.(1) of Enclosure 3.
          8.3.3.1.1. The requirements controlling the eligibility of various types of state
          services for DSMOA program eligibility are primarily governed by whether:
              8.3.3.1.1.1. The service is in furtherance of the Air Force’s DERP responsibilities
              and listed in the DSMOA, with costs that are allowable, reasonable, allocable, and
              applicable per paragraph 8.3.3.1.2.
 38                                                           AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


             8.3.3.1.1.2. The activity is legitimately a service that must be sought by the Air
             Force, not an action imposed by the State.
             8.3.3.1.1.3. The service is listed in the JEP.
          8.3.3.1.2. Other Federal Requirements. State services shall meet Federal
          requirements for CAs with states (e.g., Office of Management and Budget Circulars
          No. A-87, Cost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments, A-110,
          Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of
          Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations, and A-133, Audits
          of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations).
          8.3.3.1.3. CA Process. The Air Force, USACE, and the states use a six-step process
          for producing and validating the CA package, which is the funding instrument for the
          DSMOA program. If the Air Force does not coordinate in a timely manner, the state
          may submit its application without Air Force input. Funding for state participation in
          the ERP through the DSMOA comes from the ERA, AF or BRAC account.
      8.3.3.2. Alternatives to DSMOA for State Reimbursement.
          8.3.3.2.1. The Air Force may pursue alternative approaches to the DSMOA for
          reimbursing costs of state DERP-related services. Alternative agreements to DSMOA
          shall comply with all applicable legal requirements and DOD and Air Force policy.
          8.3.3.2.2. To ensure an orderly withdrawal from the DSMOA program, the Air Force
          shall notify the Office of the DUSD(I&E), Environment, Safety and Occupational
          Health Directorate (ODUSD(I&E)/ESOH) and the Office of the DAS of the Army
          (Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health) at least 60 days in advance of
          signing an agreement to pursue an alternative approach to DSMOA IAW DODM
          4715.20, paragraph 15.b.(2) of Enclosure 3. The Air Force shall monitor and
          document the alternative approach, and ensure it meets all legal, fiscal, and policy
          requirements and require coordination by the Cooperative Agreement Grants Officer
          and AFLOA/JACE.
8.4. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)
   8.4.1. Under 42 USC § 9604(i)(6), the ATSDR is responsible for conducting public health
   assessments (PHA) at all sites on or proposed for the NPL. CERCLA also provides that
   citizens may petition ATSDR to perform PHAs at non-NPL sites. The Air Force shall
   consider ATSDR PHAs in the cleanup process and decision making. The Air Force’s
   objective is to work with ATSDR in completing all required PHAs as expeditiously as
   possible.
   8.4.2. ATSDR does not conduct assessments of the explosive hazards associated with
   military munitions, per the Memorandum of Understanding between the Agency for Toxic
   Substances and Disease Registry, Public Health Service, and the Department of Defense on
   the Development of Toxicological Profiles for Hazardous Substances, and Public Health
   Assessments and Related Activities at DOD Facilities.
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                      39


                                            Chapter 9

                     NATURAL RESOURCE INJURY INTEGRATION

9.1. Application. Natural Resource Injury (NRI) shall be evaluated and, as appropriate,
addressed for any release of a CERCLA hazardous substance that may cause injury to natural
resources at an Air Force installation. The Air Force shall consult with the appropriate legal
office throughout this process. This requirement applies regardless of the legal authority under
which the cleanup is conducted. Installations are required to satisfy Air Force obligations both as
a responsible party and as a trustee of natural resources IAW CERCLA and DODM 4715.20.
9.2. Sites. At sites where the Air Force is a PRP and a Trustee, the responsible Air Force
organization shall:
   9.2.1. Identify sites (preferably as part of an ecological risk assessment) and, whenever
   practicable and consistent with the response action, redress it as part of the site assessment,
   investigation, remedy selection, and implementation processes.
   9.2.2. When investigating releases, promptly notify other Trustees with jurisdiction over
   natural resources at the site, which may include Federal agencies, states, and tribes, of actual
   or potential NRI.
   9.2.3. Coordinate any necessary ecological risk assessments, RIs, and response action
   planning and conduct with other natural resource Trustees IAW CERCLA (see 42 USC §§
   9604(b) and 9607(f)), the NCP, and this Instruction. This coordination does not grant the
   other Trustees any role in the remedy selection process. Where appropriate, the Air Force
   may invite other natural resource Trustees to attend an installation’s RAB meeting.
   9.2.4. Whenever practical, during the FS and as part of evaluating response alternatives,
   assess how each response alternative addresses existing NRI and whether implementation of
   a response alternative will itself cause additional NRI.
   9.2.5. Where feasible and cost effective, the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s) or
   AFCEC/CIB will select a response that results in the least amount of NRI.
9.3. Funding. The ERA, AF and BRAC accounts may be used to address natural resources
injuries only if the action to be funded is incidental to the response action process.
   9.3.1. These accounts may not be used to enhance or replace natural resources unless such
   actions are required for conduct of a response action.
   9.3.2. Environmental restoration funding may not be used to conduct natural resource
   damage assessments, or to pay other Natural Resource Trustees’ monetary natural resource
   damages. See AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management.

                                   PERMIT EXEMPTION

10.1. Scope. Under 42 USC § 9621(e)(1) and 40 CFR 300.400(e), the portion of any CERCLA
response actions that are conducted entirely on-site is exempt from requirements to obtain
Federal, state, and local permits. As defined by 40 CFR 300.5 and 300.400(e), “on-site” means
the areal extent of contamination (all media and pathways) and all suitable areas in close
proximity to the contamination necessary for implementing the response action. The exemption
applies to all permits that could otherwise be required for response actions, as well as permit
equivalency and other approval processes.
10.2. Air Force Permits. The Air Force does not renew a permit or obtain new permits or
permit equivalents for on-site CERCLA response actions. As required under CERCLA and the
NCP, the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB and NGB/A7O shall identify and
meet the substantive cleanup requirements (standards, requirements, criteria, or limitations) to
which response actions must conform. (T-0). Exceptions to this shall be made on a case-by-case
basis, contingent upon written approval of SAF/IEE.
10.3. Actions Taken Under Other Legal Authority. If the Air Force conducts responses to
CERCLA hazardous substances, or pollutants or contaminants solely under a legal authority
other than CERCLA, the permit exemption does not apply. Similarly, responses to substances
that are not CERCLA hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants (and therefore are not
subject to CERCLA) do not qualify for the CERCLA permit exemption. Integrated actions,
whereby the Air Force responds both under CERCLA and another legal authority, qualify for the
CERCLA permit exemption.

                                          Chapter 11

                              COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT

11.1. Establishing Community Involvement Programs. The Air Force will establish
community involvement programs for environmental restoration activities. DERP, CERCLA,
and the NCP provide for formal consideration of diverse environmental factors and meaningful
opportunities for public involvement on proposed response actions. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ
division(s), AFCEC/CIB and NGB/A7O conducting cleanup under CERCLA shall comply with
the community involvement requirements of CERCLA and the NCP, including developing a
community relations plan. (T-0). The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB and
NGB/A7O shall ensure equivalent opportunities for public review and comment on proposed
RCRA corrective actions or restoration activities conducted under legal authorities other than
CERCLA and RCRA. Additional information regarding stakeholder participation during the
review of DDs can be found in paragraph 8.3.1.
11.2. Point of Contact (POC). The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s) and AFCEC/CIB shall
designate a POC for ERP community involvement matters and public inquiries regarding the
ERP. The POC will be identified to the local community through appropriate means (e.g., a
newspaper notice, installation website).
11.3. Community Relations Plan (CRP). Information on environmental restoration activities
shall be made available to the public in a timely manner using appropriate mechanisms for
disseminating information outlined in the CRP (e.g., local media, public meetings and websites).
At installations where cleanup is conducted under CERCLA, the appropriate AFCEC/CZ
division(s), AFCEC/CIB and NGB/A7O shall establish a formal community involvement
program in coordination with the Installation Commander and pertinent installation offices (e.g.,
medical, public affairs) at active installations and IAW CERCLA public participation
requirements. (T-0). This program will be documented in a CRP. (See 40 CFR 300.415(n)(3)(ii),
300.430(c)(2)(ii), and 300.435(c)(1) for CRP requirements.) At installations where cleanup may
be under other frameworks than CERCLA, the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB,
and NGB/A7O supplements the CRP with requirements from the applicable legal framework.
This program shall be documented in a CRP, unless other non-CERCLA regulatory authorities
specify a different comprehensive community involvement program. The plan shall be updated,
as needed, to ensure interested members of the public have opportunities for effective
involvement.
11.4. Restoration Advisory Board (RAB). The Air Force will support establishing a RAB or
equivalent (hereafter referred to as “RAB”) at each installation or BRAC location where there is
sufficient and sustained community interest. A RAB fulfills the requirements of 32 CFR Part
202, Restoration Advisory Boards and 10 USC § 2705(c) and (d), which direct DOD to establish
a TRC or a RAB. A RAB may be established for environmental restoration conducted under
other statutes when deemed appropriate or required by a permit, enforcement order, agreement,
or statute. Only one RAB will be recognized at an installation without prior approval from the
Installation Commander at active installations or AFCEC/CIB at BRAC locations. Additional
information on RABs may be found in the OSD RAB Rule Handbook.
42                                                           AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


  11.4.1. Where there is no RAB established, the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s),
  AFCEC/CIB or NGB/A7O, as applicable, shall reassess community interest every 24 months
  or upon request by the community. (T-0). Where the reassessment finds sufficient and
  sustained community interest, the Installation Commander, or AFCEC/CIB at BRAC
  locations, approves establishing a RAB. Where the reassessment does not find sufficient and
  sustained community interest in a RAB, the Installation Commander, or AFCEC/CIB at
  BRAC locations, signs a memorandum for the record that documents the reassessment
  procedures and findings. The memo shall be included in the Administrative Record.
  11.4.2. The RAB must be comprised of representatives determined by the Installation
  Commander at active installations and ANG facilities or AFCEC/CIB at BRAC locations;
  AFCEC/CZ, AFCEC/CIB, or NGB/A7O personnel as appropriate; affected members of the
  local community; and representatives from EPA, state regulatory agencies, and tribal or local
  governments, as appropriate. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s) or AFCEC/CIB is
  responsible for ensuring that RAB members reflect the diverse interests within the
  community.
  11.4.3. The RAB must be chaired jointly by the Mission Support Group Commander or
  equivalent, unless chaired by the Installation Commander (or AFCEC/CIB representative at
  BRAC locations), and a representative of the local community. The community co-chair shall
  be selected by the community members serving on the RAB.
  11.4.4. A RAB may only address issues associated with environmental restoration activities
  under the ERP.
  11.4.5. A RAB is not subject to the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.
  However, all RAB meetings, correspondence, discussions, and proceedings shall be
  conducted in public, and no member of the public will be denied access (unless there is
  sufficient cause, for example, concern for the safety of those involved with the RAB
  meetings). Documents related to RAB proceedings or communications will be included in
  the Information Repository. If the RAB minutes reflect decision-making, copies should also
  be documented in the Administrative Record.
  11.4.6. The Installation Commander or AFCEC/CIB at BRAC locations may adjourn a RAB
  with input from the community and appropriate regulatory agencies when one or more of the
  situations outlined in 32 CFR Part 202.10(a)(1) have occurred. The Installation Commander,
  or AFCEC/CIB at BRAC locations, must document the rationale for adjournment in a
  memorandum for inclusion in the Administrative Record and appropriately notify the public
  of the decision through written notice to the RAB members and through publication of a
  notice in a local newspaper of general circulation. If a RAB is adjourned at an installation
  where environmental restoration activities are not complete, the Installation Commander and
  the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, or NGB/A7O, as applicable, shall
  ensure that stakeholders are provided an opportunity for continued effective input. Such
  opportunity shall be documented in the installation’s CRP or equivalent planning document.
  11.4.7. Installation Commanders and the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB,
  and NGB/A7O are expected to make every reasonable effort to ensure that a RAB performs
  its role as efficiently as possible. Despite these efforts, circumstances may prevent a RAB
  from operating efficiently or fulfilling its intended purpose. When this occurs, the Installation
  Commander and the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, or NGB/A7O, as
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                   43


   applicable, will make a concerted effort to resolve the issues that impair the RAB’s
   effectiveness. If unsuccessful, the Installation Commander, or AFCEC/CIB at BRAC
   locations, may elect to dissolve the RAB, if the authority to dissolve RABs has been
   delegated. Requirements for dissolving a RAB are described in 32 CFR 202.10.
11.5. Technical Assistance For Public Participation (TAPP) Program
   11.5.1. Opportunities for technical assistance through the TAPP program shall be made
   available to community members of a recognized RAB IAW 10 USC § 2705(e) and the
   TAPP regulations in 32 CFR Part 203, Technical Assistance For Public Participation
   (TAPP) In Defense Environmental Restoration Activities. Community members of a RAB or
   TRC may request technical assistance from private-sector sources through the Air Force
   RAB co-chair to AFCEC/CZR, AFCEC/CIB, or NGB/A7O, as appropriate, for approval.
   11.5.2. TAPP will be funded through the ERA, AF or BRAC account. TAPP is categorized
   as a program administration cost. There is no guaranteed or automatic TAPP funding
   allocation per installation, and there is no separate account for such funding.
      11.5.2.1. TAPP funding may not exceed $100,000 over the life of the restoration
      program at the installation. The limit for a single fiscal year is $25,000, or one percent
      (1%) of the installation’s total projected environmental restoration CTC, whichever is
      less.
      11.5.2.2. Waivers to the $100,000 total and fiscal year funding limits may be approved
      by SAF/IEE.
   11.5.3. In the event that a dispute arises concerning the approval of a TAPP request, RAB
   community members may appeal through the Air Force RAB co-chair to AFCEC/CZR,
   AFCEC/CIB, or NGB/A7O, as appropriate. The highest level of appeal is SAF/IEE. Appeals
   on waivers to the annual funding limits will be determined by SAF/IEE.
   11.5.4. Communities that have received EPA Technical Assistance Grants or Technical
   Outreach Services to Communities are not precluded from receiving a TAPP award.
   However, these other sources of funds are relevant considerations during the decision
   process.
   11.5.5. Each RAB receiving a TAPP award must submit an annual TAPP Results Report
   (per DODM 4715.20, paragraph 16.d.(5)) through AFCEC to SAF/IEE for transmittal to
   DUSD(I&E).
 44                                                          AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


                                          Chapter 12

                                RECORDS MANAGEMENT

12.1. Records Maintenance and Retention. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s) or
NGB/A7O, as appropriate, is responsible for collecting and retaining environmental restoration
records at active installations and ANG facilities IAW applicable statutes, regulations, and Air
Force records management directives (to include compliance with the Air Force RDS). (T-0). As
mutually agreed between the losing organization and AFCEC regarding the transfer of the ERP
at BRAC locations and other transferred properties, AFCEC/CIB will assume responsibility for
maintaining environmental restoration records. (T-0). The administrative record for ERP
activities must be maintained for fifty (50) years after the last site achieves Response Complete
(RC). Records for cleanup conducted under other legal authorities shall be maintained and
disposed of IAW applicable legal requirements or the Air Force RDS located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm, whichever provides a longer retention
period. Further, negotiated agreements, permits, and unilateral or consent decrees may have
specific record maintenance and retention requirements to which the Air Force must adhere.
12.2. Management Action Plan (MAP)
   12.2.1. The MAP, or BRAC equivalent document (hereinafter referred to as “MAP”), is a
   key management tool for the ERP at an active installation or a BRAC location. The
   appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, and NGB/A7O, as applicable, prepares a
   MAP for each active installation, ANG facility, and BRAC location where activities under
   the ERP have yet to be completed. The MAP is used to track environmental restoration
   requirements, schedules, and LUCs. The MAP also serves as the basis for overall program
   planning, budget development, and execution decisions. The MAP describes an integrated,
   coordinated approach for conducting environmental restoration activities. The MAP shall
   address all required restoration actions, by year, through the estimated completion.
   12.2.2. A MAP will be prepared for each installation where environmental restoration
   activities have not yet been completed. MAPs must meet the requirements specified in
   DODM 4715.20, paragraph 8.c.(2) of Enclosure 3. MAPs for geographically separated sites
   shall be addressed in either the parent installation’s MAP, or in a separate MAP.
   12.2.3. The MAP function in EESOH-MIS for IRP sites meets the requirement for a MAP,
   provided EESOH-MIS is populated with complete and current data.
12.3. Administrative Record
   12.3.1. Pursuant to 42 USC § 9613(k) and 40 CFR 300.800-300.825, the Air Force shall
   establish and maintain an Administrative Record at the installation or other central location.
   The Administrative Record (or similar record) is the official legal record that contains the
   documents that form the basis for the selection of a CERCLA response action. Per 40 CFR
   300.805(a), AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB or NGB/A7O, as appropriate, shall
   establish an official docket where documents included in the Administrative Record shall be
   located. The official copy of the Administrative Record shall be maintained IAW DODM
   4715.20, paragraph 7.a.(1) and (4) of Enclosure 3.
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    45


  12.3.2. Additionally, pursuant to 42 USC § 9613(k) and 40 CFR 300.800-300.825, a copy of
  the documents included in the Administrative Record shall also be made available for public
  inspection at or near the site. This copy of the Administrative Record shall be included in the
  Information Repository. See paragraph 12.4.1.3. The copy of the Administrative Record
  made available to the public may be in any of the following formats: hard copy, microfiche,
  web-based, or such electronic formats as compact discs or portable hard drives. If any
  discrepancies are found, the record copies maintained by the appropriate AFCEC/CZ
  division(s), AFCEC/CIB or NGB/A7O, as appropriate, are the official records.
  12.3.3. The content, format, and retention of the Administrative Record should be consistent
  with EPA guidance on the Administrative Record. If such EPA guidance conflicts with this
  Instruction, this Instruction controls. For responses under RCRA, the Administrative Record
  will comply with this Instruction unless the requirements in the RCRA permit are greater.
  12.3.4. IAW 42 USC § 9603(d), it is a felony to destroy certain records that must be retained
  for 50 years.
  12.3.5. The Administrative Record shall include, but is not limited to:
     12.3.5.1. Documents and materials containing information that form the basis for the Air
     Force’s selection of a response action, including regulatory agency review and
     comments. Confidential or privileged documents must be kept in a separate portion of the
     Administrative Record not accessible to the public. Whenever feasible, the AFCEC/CZ
     division(s), AFCEC/CIB or NGB/A7O, as appropriate, shall summarize or rephrase (with
     legal counsel assistance) those portions of the privileged document that pertain to the
     response selection so that a summary or rephrased version can be included in the publicly
     accessible portion of the Administrative Record.
     12.3.5.2. Documents made available to the public, as required by CERCLA, for removal
     or remedial site assessments or actions, as well as public comments received on these
     documents.
     12.3.5.3. While not a legal requirement, documents and materials containing information
     on the response action’s performance (e.g., RD/remedial action, data reports on remedy
     progress, RACRs, and five-year reviews) should be included in the Administrative
     Record.
  12.3.6. An Administrative Record or similar record retention requirements may be required
  by a permit, enforcement order, or agreement for cleanup under non-CERCLA statutory
  authorities.
     12.3.6.1. In cases where an Administrative Record or similar record is not required by a
     permit, enforcement order, or agreement, as a matter of guidance, the AFCEC/CZ
     division(s), AFCEC/CIB or NGB/A7O, as appropriate, shall establish a record of
     environmental actions for environmental restoration activities conducted under legal
     authorities other than CERCLA equivalent in scope to the Administrative Record
     requirements described herein.
     12.3.6.2. The record of environmental actions shall include, but is not limited to, the
     items listed in paragraph 12.3.5.
 46                                                          AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


   12.3.7. The AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB or NGB/A7O, as appropriate, shall include
   all of the data gathered to characterize an MRS (including geophysical sensor data that is
   digitally recorded and geo-referenced) accompanied by a clear audit trail of pertinent
   analyses and resulting decisions in the Administrative Record. Where collecting digitally
   recorded, geo-referenced, geophysical sensor data is impractical or unwarranted, AFCEC/CZ
   division(s), AFCEC/CIB or NGB/A7O, as appropriate, shall forward a memorandum
   documenting the determination to SAF/IEE through HQ USAF/A4CF. The memorandum
   shall be included in the Administrative Record and the Information Repository.
12.4. Information Repository
   12.4.1. As required by CERCLA (42 USC § 9617(d)) and the NCP (40 CFR
   300.415(n)(3)(iii) and 300.430(c)(2)(iii)), the AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB or
   NGB/A7O, as appropriate, shall establish an Information Repository.
      12.4.1.1. The Information Repository provides the public with a single reference source
      for information about environmental restoration activities at the installation.
      12.4.1.2. The Information Repository shall, at a minimum, contain items made available
      to the public, including documentation that is in the Administrative Record and all public
      documents associated with the RAB or equivalent. The Information Repository may also
      contain other documents pertinent to the activities at the installation, particularly
      documents related to ERP community outreach activities and publicly disseminated
      information.
      12.4.1.3. The Information Repository must be maintained at a location near the
      installation or site that is easily accessible to the public, and where the information is
      available for inspection at times convenient to the public. Air Force installations do not
      have to maintain a hard copy of the Information Repository. Installations may maintain
      the Information Repository solely in an electronic format (e.g., web-based, compact disc,
      microfiche, and/or removable hard drive). If the installation provides a web-based or
      electronic file at or near the site, the Air Force must ensure that the public has access to
      the appropriate technology to review the files at that location.
      12.4.1.4. The AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB or NGB/A7O, as appropriate,
      through the appropriate public affairs office shall inform the public of the establishment
      of the Information Repository and provide notice of availability of the Administrative
      Record for public review.
   12.4.2. Information on environmental restoration activities shall be made available to the
   public in a timely manner using appropriate mechanisms for disseminating information to the
   public (e.g., local media, public meetings, and websites). Such mechanisms shall be
   identified in the CRP (or similar planning document) and be used in a consistent manner.
   12.4.3. An Information Repository and other public access to information may be required
   by permit, enforcement agreement, or other requirements for cleanup under non-CERCLA
   statutory authorities. Even when not required by these authorities, an Information Repository
   IAW the requirements in paragraph 12.4.1. shall be established.
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                 47


   12.4.4. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB and NGB/A7O shall ensure
   that documents for publication in a public repository do not contain procurement-sensitive,
   personal, or security-related information that is privileged from release under the law.
12.5. Site Audit File. A site audit file shall be maintained IAW DODM 4715.20, paragraphs
13.a.(7) and 14.f. and g. of Enclosure 3.
   12.5.1. GIS files necessary for communicating information about DERP sites are to be
   developed and maintained IAW Air Force standards, and be provided to the appropriate Air
   Force data repository.
   12.5.2. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s) shall provide detailed technical guidance on
   site audit file contents.
 48                                                           AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


                                           Chapter 13

                                  CLEANUP AGREEMENTS

13.1. Interagency Agreements (IAG)/Federal Facility Agreements (FFA). Pursuant to 42
USC § 9620(e)(2), within 180 days of EPA’s review of an RI/FS at a site listed on the NPL, the
Air Force (through AFCEC or NGB, as appropriate) and EPA must enter into an IAG. (T-0). If
an agreement is not entered into within that time frame, per 42 USC § 9620(e)(5), the Air Force
is required to report that fact to Congress and provide the reasons for not having an IAG in place.
The Air Force uses an FFA at its facilities on the NPL to satisfy the requirements of an IAG. For
Air Force facilities on the NPL without signed FFAs:
   13.1.1. The EPA and Department of the Army Agreement, Fort Eustis Federal Facility
   Agreement, 25 Mar 08, shall be used as the standard to satisfy the requirement for an IAG
   pursuant to 42 USC § 9620(e)(2) and (4). Only make site specific changes.
   13.1.2. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, or NGB/A7O, in consultation
   with AFLOA/JACE, shall be the lead in working with EPA Regions and states to negotiate
   the FFA.
   13.1.3. States will determine whether they will sign an FFA.
   13.1.4. To the extent the Air Force, EPA Region, or state seek variations to the standardized
   FFA, the SAF/IEE will be consulted and approve any variations, and notify DUSD(I&E), as
   required.
   13.1.5. SAF/IEE shall submit all proposed FFAs for a “72 hour review” to DUSD(I&E), the
   Deputy General Counsel for Environment and Installations (DGC(E&I)), and the other DOD
   Components with DERP responsibilities prior to signature IAW DODM 4715.20, paragraph
   6.g. of Enclosure 3.
13.2. Developing Agreements
   13.2.1. Any new agreement with federal, state, or local regulators pursuant to Section 120 of
   CERCLA (42 USC § 9620), to include an MOU or any similar arrangement, or substantive
   revisions of existing such agreements must be approved by SAF/IEE. Furthermore, SAF/IEE
   approval must be obtained prior to entering into negotiations for such agreements.
   13.2.2. Authority to sign the FFA will be IAW the SAF/IEE re-delegation memorandum.
13.3. Dispute Resolution. To the greatest extent possible, AFCEC or NGB/A7O, as
appropriate, should work with regulators informally before invoking dispute resolution.
   13.3.1. Disputes at NPL Installations. If an issue between regulators and the Air Force arises,
   the dispute resolution process designated in the FFA will apply. If no FFA exists, the Air
   Force shall use the DSMOA CA process, to resolve disputes, if one is in place. (T-1). Where
   there is not a signed FFA or DSMOA, the resolution process will be determined on a case-
   by-case basis by AFCEC/CZ, AFCEC/CI, or NGB/A7O, as appropriate, after consulting with
   AFLOA/JACE.
   13.3.2. Disputes at Non-NPL Installations. Use the resolution process stated in the DSMOA,
   unless a cleanup agreement has been entered that contains an alternative dispute resolution
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                      49


   mechanism. (T-1). Where there is not a signed DSMOA or applicable cleanup agreement, the
   resolution process will be determined on a case-by-case basis by AFCEC/CZ, AFCEC/CI, or
   NGB/A7O, as appropriate, after consulting with AFLOA/JACE.
13.4. Executing Work Under Other Legal Authorities. The Air Force maximizes the use of
its DERP authority and delegated CERCLA authorities (e.g., as a lead agency). However, the Air
Force may conduct environmental restoration pursuant to CERCLA; other applicable Federal,
state, or local laws addressing environmental restoration (e.g., RCRA corrective action); or a
combination thereof. See paragraph 8.3.2. for information on executing work under other legal
authorities.
   13.4.1. In instances where a regulatory agency seeks to use a framework other than DERP
   and CERCLA (e.g., 42 USC §§ 300f-300j-26), the Air Force will pursue compliance with all
   CERCLA requirements as well, especially with respect to the content of DDs, public
   involvement, and maintaining the administrative record.
   13.4.2. When a regulatory agency seeks to use an authority for environmental restoration
   other than CERCLA, RCRA corrective action, or USTs pursuant to 42 USC § 6991 and 40
   C.F.R. part 280, subpart F (e.g., 42 USC §§ 6934 and 6973, commonly known as RCRA
   3013 or 7003 orders, respectively), and AFCEC or the NGB is considering such an
   agreement, SAF/IEE must approve entering negotiations and approve any subsequent
   agreement. SAF/IEE will notify DUSD(I&E), as required. An exception to this requirement
   would be when addressing a petroleum release from an AST or distribution pipeline.
   13.4.3. When the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, or NGB/A7O seeks to
   voluntarily pursue environmental restoration under an authority other than CERCLA, RCRA
   corrective action, or UST regulations, where applicable, (e.g., the Air Force wants to pursue a
   RCRA 3013 or 7003 order), AFCEC must gain SAF/IEE and DUSD(I&E) approvals to enter
   negotiations. SAF/IEE must approve any subsequent agreement and notify DUSD(I&E)
   accordingly. If a DOD Component or the DUSD(I&E) non-concurs, the Air Force cannot
   pursue the alternate approach until the objection is resolved. An exception to this requirement
   would be when addressing a petroleum release from an AST or distribution pipeline.
13.5. Agreements for Third-Party Sites (TPS). TPS Agreements, including Consent Decrees
and other litigation settlement agreements, are not addressed in this Instruction. The appropriate
AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, and NGB/A7O should contact AFLOA/JACE when
involved with TPS. Such agreements require Department of Justice and SAF/IEE (or designated
delegate) approval. AFLOA/JACE manages and coordinates such agreements in consultation
with SAF/GCN and the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s) or AFCEC/CIB.
13.6. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)-Energy Sites on Air Force Installations
   13.6.1. Per DOD 4140.25-M, DOD Management of Bulk Petroleum Products, Natural Gas,
   and Coal, DLA-Energy will fund the identification, assessment, and remediation costs of fuel
   spills and leaks from DLA-Energy-managed bulk storage facilities and transportation
   systems that occur after October 1, 1992. Restoration of contaminated sites resulting from
   activities conducted prior to October 1, 1992, is an Air Force-funded responsibility.
   13.6.2. The Air Force and DLA-Energy may enter into an MOU for a specific location or
   facility addressing how to divide responsibilities for environmental restoration (not related to
   construction), and when signed, the MOU supersedes the guidance in DOD 4140.25-M.

   (note: The MOU may be signed by AFCEC/CZR, AFCEC/CIB, or NGB/A7O, as
   appropriate, with copy to HQ USAF/A4CF.)
13.7. Informal Resolution. Upon identifying an issue that may impair program goals, or
cleanup efficiency or effectiveness, RPMs will notify AFCEC/CZO, AFCEC/CIB, or NGB/A7O,
as appropriate, and attempt to resolve the issue for up to 30 days. (T-1). If the issue is not
resolved during this period, AFCEC/CZO, AFCEC/CIB, or NGB/A7O, as appropriate, will
evaluate the matter and take action to help reach resolution. If after 60 days from initial RPM
notification the issue remains unresolved, HQ USAF/A4CF will be notified to assist in reaching
resolution, with support from (and notification to) SAF/IEE, and AFLOA/JACE as may be
needed.

                                          Chapter 14

                                  DECISION DOCUMENTS

14.1. Basis for Action. All restoration legal authorities require that a basis for action exists,
which in turn is based upon the finding of unacceptable risk. This finding should be documented
in the appropriate DD.
   14.1.1. For environmental restoration actions conducted solely pursuant to CERCLA, a basis
   for action under CERCLA is established in the RI and the component baseline risk
   assessment. A basis for action under CERCLA generally exists when:
       14.1.1.1. For groundwater, a federal or state non-zero Maximum Contaminant Level
       Goal or Maximum Contaminant Level is exceeded when groundwater is a current or
       potential source of drinking water, or for surface water, a water quality standard that
       supports the designated uses for the surface water is exceeded, and there is a potential or
       actual exposure pathway. Other chemical-specific standards that define an acceptable
       level of risk may be considered (on a discretionary basis); or
       14.1.1.2. Ecological risk is determined unacceptable; or
       14.1.1.3. Cumulative cancer risk exceeds one in ten thousand (10-4); or
       14.1.1.4. The non-cancer risk exceeds a hazard index of 1.
   14.1.2. Cancer and non-cancer risk are established on the basis of appropriate toxicity
   values. See paragraph 18.2.3.4.
   14.1.3. Deviations from paragraphs 14.1.1. and 14.1.2. require the approval of SAF/IEE, in
   consultation with the pertinent AFCEC offices, SAF/GCN, and/or AFLOA/JACE.
14.2. Documentation Requirements. CERCLA, RCRA, and other environmental laws with
cleanup requirements, to include state counterparts, require that decisions that select an
environmental restoration or response action be formally documented. A response action cannot
begin until the DD is finalized. Except for an emergency removal prior to the DD, the Air Force
must document the proposed response action and provide it to the public for review and
comment (e.g., PP). A PP and DD are also required for interim actions, and no action and no
further action decisions after an RI/FS or equivalent has been performed. For emergency actions,
a DD is required as soon as feasible after initiating the emergency action, such as a removal
action memorandum for an emergency removal. The DD, at a minimum, will include all facts,
technical rationale, alternatives considered and the selected action, and site-specific
determinations considered in the course of identifying the selected response. The DD will also
define the action(s) to be implemented, applicable federal and state requirements for the selected
action, environmental restoration objectives, and exit strategy. The DD must contain a level of
detail appropriate to the site situation and explain the evaluation criteria used to select the
remedy.
   14.2.1. The decisions that require formal documentation are:
       14.2.1.1. Removal and other similar actions.
52                                                        AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


     14.2.1.2. Selection and implementation of a specific remedy (or specific interim
     remedy), including monitored natural attenuation and LUCs at a site.
     14.2.1.3. No action is required at a site.
     14.2.1.4. No further action is required at a site.
  14.2.2. Regardless of whether or not the legal authority under which the response action is
  taken requires a DD, environmental personnel should document the decisions above, the
  actions taken, and ensure the appropriate authority has approved the decision and associated
  funding. This documentation should be maintained in an Administrative Record (or
  equivalent) for the site.
  14.2.3. The documentation of decisions at both NPL and non-NPL sites shall conform, in
  content and format, with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and EPA
  guidelines and criteria for preparing DDs. While not a legal requirement, when conducting
  CERCLA remedial actions, use the format for PPs and RODs in EPA guidance, OSWER
  9200.1-23P, July 30, 1999.
     14.2.3.1. Requirements recorded in DDs shall meet all legal requirements and be
     appropriately streamlined to contain cleanup objectives and essential implementation,
     operation, and maintenance actions to achieve these objectives. DDs should contain
     enough detail about cleanup objectives and actions so the exit strategy for RC and SC is
     apparent and that criteria are well defined to objectively determine when RC or SC to
     unlimited use and unrestricted exposure is met.
     14.2.3.2. For active installations:
         14.2.3.2.1. The AFCEC/CZ Director or the Deputy Director signs the DD and is
         accountable for achieving cleanup objectives and cleanup actions identified in the
         DD. (At locations where the cleanup is conducted under RCRA, the Installation
         Commander signs the DD after coordination with AFCEC/CZR.)
         14.2.3.2.2. All DDs, including PPs and RODs, must be reviewed by AFLOA/JACE,
         AFCEC/CZR and AFCEC/CZT, and be coordinated with the Installation Commander
         prior to review by regulatory agencies.
     14.2.3.3. For ANG facilities:
         14.2.3.3.1. The NGB/A7O signs the DD and is accountable for achieving cleanup
         objectives and cleanup actions identified in the DD. (At locations where the cleanup
         is conducted under RCRA, the Installation Commander will sign the DD after
         coordination with NGB/A7O.)
         14.2.3.3.2. All DDs, including PPs and RODs, must obtain NGB legal review, and
         coordination from the Installation Commander prior to regulatory agency review.
     14.2.3.4. For BRAC locations:
         14.2.3.4.1. The AFCEC/CI Director or Deputy Director signs the DD and is
         accountable for achieving cleanup objectives and cleanup actions identified in the
         DD.
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                       53


           14.2.3.4.2. All DDs, including PPs and RODs, must be reviewed by AFLOA/JACE,
           AFCEC/CIB and AFCEC/CZT prior to review by regulatory agencies.
       14.2.3.5. All DDs, once finalized, shall be included in the Administrative Record.
       (Remedial action cannot commence until the DD is in the Administrative Record.)
14.3. Documenting No Further Response Action Planned (NFRAP) Decisions in the
Evaluation Phases. One possible outcome of the site evaluation phases (e.g., CERCLA PA/SI,
or RCRA Facility Assessment (RFA)) is a determination that no further investigation, study, or
cleanup is warranted or necessary.
   14.3.1. A NFRAP determination is appropriate when, based on the historical and physical
   evidence collected, the Air Force determines that no hazardous substances, pollutants or
   contaminants are detected at the site; or no releases of hazardous substances, pollutants or
   contaminants present at the site pose an unacceptable hazard to human health or the
   environment.
   14.3.2. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB and NGB/A7O are required to
   formally document no action and NFRAP decisions in a NFRAP report, RCRA release
   report, or other NFRAP-equivalent document and include documentation supporting the
   decision in the Administrative Record. (T-0).
   14.3.3. Pursuant to 42 USC § 9620(f) and 9621(f) and 10 USC § 2705, EPA, state,
   territorial, and local agencies shall be provided the opportunity to review and comment on
   the report. For CERCLA PA/SI NFRAP decisions, 40 CFR §§ 300.410 and 300.420 contains
   general report content requirements, and implementing EPA guidance contains further
   recommended report format and content provisions.
   14.3.4. Under CERCLA the EPA Region and appropriate state and local authorities must be
   provided review and comment opportunities. Under RCRA, EPA or state approval is required
   for a NFRAP determination.
   14.3.5. If a regulator seeks further investigation and/or removal or remedial actions after a
   NFRAP determination has been completed, notify AFCEC/CZR, AFCEC/CIB, or
   NGB/A7O, as appropriate, concerning the request. Those divisions, consulting with
   AFLOA/JACE, should provide direction as to an appropriate response in this circumstance.
14.4. No Action (Necessary) Decision Document. When an RI determines there is no
unacceptable risk and therefore no basis for action, this decision must be documented in both a
no action PP and a ROD. Both documents shall sufficiently summarize both the RI and the
baseline risk assessment to establish that no unacceptable risk exists. Similar processes and
requirements normally exist under other legal authorities (for example, under RCRA, either a
RCRA Facility Investigation or Corrective Measures Study would normally document a “no
basis for action”).
14.5. No Further Action (NFA) Decision Document. If a prior removal action or interim
remedial action has been taken and it is subsequently determined that the action has addressed all
unacceptable risk at the site (so that unlimited use and unrestricted exposure levels are attained),
an NFA PP and ROD must be completed. The NFA PP and ROD should document the prior
response action, the no unacceptable risk determination, and substantiate that no further remedial
action is necessary to ensure protectiveness. Depending on site-specific circumstances, a risk
 54                                                          AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


screening or focused/streamlined remedial investigation may be required. RCRA corrective
actions may be subject to similar RCRA requirements depending on the applicable law and
permit provisions (normally the lead RCRA regulator must approve the RCRA document that
establishes the NFA determination).
14.6. Short-Term Actions
   14.6.1. The Air Force will consider and implement Interim Risk Management (IRM)
   activities as appropriate IAW paragraph 3.a.(2) of DOD Instruction 4715.07. The appropriate
   AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, and NGB/A7O are encouraged to conduct IRM
   activities, such as removal or interim corrective action measures, when appropriate.
   However, short-term actions should not be taken solely to avoid taking long-term actions.
   Short-term actions may be appropriate to abate, minimize, stabilize, mitigate, prevent, or
   eliminate threats from releases. Such actions must, to the extent practical, contribute to the
   efficient performance of and not be inconsistent with anticipated long-term actions. 40 CFR
   §§ 300.415(b)(2) and (e) contain factors to consider to determine if a removal is appropriate,
   and examples of actions and situations where a removal action generally is appropriate.
   Review and adjust, as appropriate, the IRM activities implemented if new information
   becomes available.
   14.6.2. CERCLA Removal Actions. Selection of a removal action is documented in an
   Action Memorandum. The specific requirements for an Action Memorandum depend on the
   scope of the action, urgency of the situation, and the time available before the action must
   begin. The Air Force shall provide the opportunity for EPA, state and local agencies, and the
   public to review and comment on all Air Force removal actions as documented in an Action
   Memorandum, except for emergency removals taken because of imminent and substantial
   endangerment to human health or the environment when consultation would be impractical.
   However, regulators should be notified of the planned emergency removal and an action
   memorandum must be completed promptly thereafter. For more information, see OSWER
   Final Guidance, Superfund Removal Guidance for Preparing Action Memoranda.
   14.6.3. RCRA Interim Measures. RCRA interim measures are similar to CERCLA removal
   and interim remedial actions. All interim measures shall be documented as specified by
   applicable requirements.
   14.6.4. Short-term measures shall be conducted IAW applicable legal requirements and
   documented in the Administrative Record.
14.7. Updates to the Decision Document. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s),
AFCEC/CIB and NGB/A7O shall update the DD when changing the remedy to protect human
health and the environment or altering the basic features of the selected remedy. (T-0). Such
changes are those that alter scope, performance, or cost of the selected remedy determined to be
necessary as a result of implementing the initial CERCLA remedy. Changes to the remedy
require modification of the DD and shall be IAW 40 CFR Sections 300.430(f)(3) and
300.435(c)(2). Changes to remedies under RCRA or state equivalents may procedurally require
different steps. Periodic reviews afford the Air Force opportunities to confirm the conclusions in
an existing DD.
14.8. Documenting Decisions at Installations on the National Priorities List (NPL). IAW
CERCLA (42 USC § 9620(e)(4)) and the NCP (40 CFR Sections 300.430(f)(4) and
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                       55


300.435(c)(2)), EPA and the Air Force must jointly assess remedial alternatives and select the
remedy. To support the selection of a remedial action, all facts, analyses of facts, and site-
specific policy determinations considered in the course of carrying out activities shall be
documented, as appropriate, in a record of decision, in a level of detail appropriate to the site
situation, for inclusion in the administrative record. Documentation shall explain how the
evaluation criteria were used to select the remedy. If no agreement can be reached, the EPA
Administrator solely selects the remedy. The DD must include the selected remedy and comply
with all CERCLA and NCP requirements, such as 40 CFR Section 300.430(f)(5). FFAs may
modify this process to some extent with consultation and dispute resolution procedures.
14.9. Documenting Decisions at Non-NPL Installations. Under CERCLA the Air Force
requirements for documenting remedial alternatives and selected remedy decisions in a DD and
soliciting comment are the same as for a site on the NPL. However, there is no requirement that
EPA or the state jointly assess and select the remedy under CERCLA, or that a regulator solely
select the remedy if agreement is not reached. Instead, if the regulator(s) disagrees with the
selection of the cleanup alternative, the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, or
NGB/A7O, as applicable, should enter into appropriate dispute resolution with notification to
SAF/IEE, as appropriate.
14.10. Documenting Decisions under Other or Mixed/Integrated Cleanup Laws. If cleanup
actions are primarily conducted under a legal authority other than CERCLA, such as RCRA or a
state response law, then the requirements of that law for selecting and documenting cleanup
decisions must be met. For example, under RCRA corrective action authorities, the source of the
release must be controlled. Source control is considered under CERCLA, but is not a distinct
remedy selection criterion. Under the scenario of a mixed/integrated approach, the decision
selection and documentation requirements of both cleanup laws must be met, preferably in one
combined decision and documentation process. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s),
AFCEC/CIB, or NGB/A7O, as applicable, must consult with AFLOA/JACE and/or SAF/GCN to
ensure requirements are met.
14.11. Unique Documentation Requirements at Munitions Response Sites (MRS). Due to
the unique hazards posed by UXO, DMM, and MC, the Air Force is subject to specific
documentation and reporting requirements at MRSs, in addition to the documentation authorities
in CERCLA and other legal authorities. Consistent with DOD 6055.09-M and DODI 6055.16,
Explosives Safety Management Program, an explosive safety submission is required to be
prepared and submitted for HQ AFSEC/SEW and DDESB approval prior to intrusive activities
(e.g., removal or remedial action) on an MRS, with the exception of small arms ranges. An after
action report must be prepared at the conclusion of the intrusive activities and sent to HQ
AFSEC/SEW and DDESB for their records. If an MRS is recommended for NFA at the
conclusion of a munitions response (e.g., removal and/or remedial action), an NFA explosive
safety submission must be prepared and submitted for HQ USAF/SEW and DDESB approval,
per the requirements in DOD 6055.09-M. While an explosive safety submission is not required
prior to performing remediation at a small arms range, an NFA explosive safety submission is
still required to be completed as part of site closeout documentation.
14.12. Cleanup Levels. Under CERCLA and the NCP, 40 CFR § 300.430(e)(2) remedial action
goals and cleanup levels are determined based upon ARARs. In the absence of ARARs, cleanup
levels are established on the basis of toxicity values, with concentration levels established within
a 10-4 to 10-6 acceptable human health cancer risk range, and for non-cancer risk at concentration
 56                                                          AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


levels that do not exceed a hazard index of 1. For cancer risk the preference and point of
departure is to achieve concentrations that achieve cancer risk levels at 10-6. However, the
ultimate cleanup level is based upon the nine NCP remedy selection criteria within this
acceptable range. Where compliance with ARARs due to the presence of multiple contaminants
or pathways either exceeds a cancer risk of 10-4 or a non-cancer hazard index of 1, cleanup levels
may be further modified based upon the above rules. See paragraph 18.2.3.4. for information on
choosing toxicity values.
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                        57


                                            Chapter 15

                 LONG TERM REMEDIES AND LAND USE CONTROLS

15.1. Long-Term Remedies. At active installations that are not transferring outside of Air
Force control, the Air Force retains responsibility for implementing, maintaining, and monitoring
any long-term remedy. Such remedies may include pump and treat systems, monitored natural
attenuation, or landfill gas monitoring. Therefore, the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s) or
NGB/A7O, in coordination with the installation, should put mechanisms in place to manage such
actions, including internal implementation plans; documenting areas subject to restrictions and
notifying affected users as necessary; planning, programming and budgeting for necessary
funding; and ensuring the remedy is monitored and addressing remedy failures, if they occur.
Where installations are transferring to other U.S. government entities or outside of the U.S.
government, responsibilities for implementing, maintaining, monitoring (and sometimes
reporting on) long-term remedies is subject to negotiation. Where the Air Force retains such
responsibilities, it should follow the same steps outlined as for active installations (done by
AFCEC/CIB for BRAC properties).
15.2. Land Use Controls (LUC). LUCs include any type of physical, legal, or administrative
mechanism that restricts the use of, or limits access to, real property to prevent or reduce risks to
human health and the environment. LUCs are part of a remedial action and can be short-term or
long-term; if long-term, LUCs should be addressed as described in paragraph 15.1. (Note: LUCs
are subject to audit.)
   15.2.1. LUCs may be needed when the environmental restoration decision requires controls
   on, or limits to, property use to prevent or limit exposure to hazardous substances, pollutants
   or contaminants based on the reasonably anticipated future land use. LUCs may also be
   required while conducting environmental restoration investigations or implementing remedial
   actions.
   15.2.2. The central objective of LUCs is to protect human health and the environment. As
   such, LUCs are a common component of any cleanup action that does not allow for unlimited
   use and unrestricted exposure following the completion of the response action or where there
   is a need for a LUC to protect the effectiveness of the remedy. For example, LUCs will likely
   be necessary at MRSs, to ensure protection of human health, public safety, and the
   environment because total removal of the military munitions may not be possible due to
   technical limitations. Use of a system of mutually reinforcing controls is often a necessary
   component in a LUC strategy and internal written plan.
15.3. Implementation Requirements
   15.3.1. At all sites where a use restriction is part of environmental restoration activities, the
   use restriction shall be clearly defined, documented in a DD, and enforceable. Implementing
   use restrictions through established real property and land use management mechanisms
   provides a means to ensure that the restrictions remain effective.
   15.3.2. LUCs should be implemented, maintained, and monitored at the local level whenever
   possible.
58                                                         AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


     15.3.2.1. Active Installations and ANG Facilities. Implementing, maintaining, and
     monitoring LUCs (and other long-term remedies) is the responsibility of appropriate
     AFCEC/CZ division(s) at active installations and NGB/A7O at ANG facilities. The
     installation must ensure LUCs are included in the appropriate base documents (such as
     real property records, maps, and land use and related planning documents) and that local
     actions are consistent with the LUC and other long-term remedies. The appropriate
     AFCEC/CZ division(s) or NGB/A7O and the Installation Commander or a designated
     representative shall ensure the following actions are taken: (T-0).
        15.3.2.1.1. Put appropriate mechanisms in place to manage LUCs and incorporate
        LUCs into the existing land use management processes of the locality or the
        installation. For example, all LUCs must be included in an installation’s
        comprehensive plan or equivalent. (See AFI 32-7062, Air Force Comprehensive
        Planning, for more information on the comprehensive plan.)
        15.3.2.1.2. Develop and document an internal LUCIP for the installation and specific
        sites, as needed, that defines the responsibilities of all parties involved in
        implementing, maintaining, and monitoring the LUCs, and document or annotate a
        reference to the LUCIP in the installation’s comprehensive plan. LUCIPs are internal
        plans and not enforceable, and should not be made a term, condition, or requirement
        of a DD executed under CERCLA authority. For DDs executed under RCRA
        authority, a LUCIP can be included in the DD if the lead regulator requires it as a
        matter of state law applicable to all entities similarly situated and AFLOA/JACE (or
        NGB/JA for ANG facilities) concurs.
        15.3.2.1.3. Plan, program, and budget for the necessary funding in appropriate
        accounts to implement, maintain, and monitor LUCs.
        15.3.2.1.4. Document areas restricted by LUCs in EESOH-MIS. EESOH-MIS shall
        include information on the types of LUCs established and any Air Force
        responsibilities for implementing, maintaining, and monitoring the LUCs.
        15.3.2.1.5. If a LUC is breached, work with the installation to take corrective
        measures and notify regulators. Immediate steps must be taken to ensure the LUC is
        restored, including taking any necessary corrective actions. If the integrity of the LUC
        cannot be restored, then modify or terminate the LUC IAW paragraph 15.3.2.1.7 and
        revise other components of the remedy to ensure the remedy is protective of human
        health and the environment.
        15.3.2.1.6. The Air Force has no authority to grant a real property interest for a LUC
        (e.g., an environmental covenant) on an active installation, but may record an
        environmental notice of contamination or place a location on a state LUC registry that
        similarly does not create a property interest. Consult AFLOA/JACE and SAF/GCN or
        NGB/JA, as appropriate, before agreeing to any such notice.
        15.3.2.1.7. Modify or terminate LUCs through the same process used to establish the
        LUC. If the LUC is terminated, ensure the LUC is removed from the mechanisms that
        recorded its existence (e.g., master planning maps). In cases where previous DDs
        need to be revised, a note to the file, Explanation of Significant Differences, or DD
        amendment (or equivalent DDs under RCRA or other cleanup regime) is used to
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    59


        select and document changes to the selected remedy, including details regarding
        LUCs at the site.
     15.3.2.2. BRAC Locations and Property Transfers Outside the Federal Government.
     Prior to transfer, AFCEC/CIB is responsible for ensuring that LUCs are implemented,
     maintained, and monitored at BRAC locations; AFCEC/CZ has that responsibility for
     other Air Force properties anticipated to be transferred. Either AFCEC/CZ or AFCEC/CI,
     as applicable, shall also: (T-0).
        15.3.2.2.1. Ensure that LUCs are clearly described in property conveyance
        documents, such as deeds, and reflect the remedy selected in DDs, if it is determined
        that a LUC is necessary. LUCs should also be reflected in transfer-related documents
        that reflect environmental restrictions (e.g., Finding of Suitability to Transfer, which
        is described in DOD 4165.66M, Base Redevelopment and Realignment Manual,
        March 1, 2006). AFCEC should work with the appropriate local and state agencies
        and potential transferee(s) early in the disposal process to determine an appropriate
        allocation of responsibilities as to long-term remedies, including LUCs, and then
        capturing that allocation in appropriate environmental and real property documents.
        15.3.2.2.2. Develop and document a LUCIP, where required, for the installation or
        specific sites that defines the responsibilities of all parties involved in implementing,
        maintaining, and monitoring the LUCs. LUCIPs are internal plans and not
        enforceable, and should not be made a term, condition, or requirement of a DD
        executed under CERCLA authority. For DDs executed under RCRA authority, a
        LUCIP can be included in the DD if the lead regulator requires it as a matter of state
        law and AFLOA/JACE concurs.
        15.3.2.2.3. Ensure applicable environmental and real property documents reflect the
        allocation of responsibility for long-term remedies to future owners of the property. If
        LUCs are part of the selected remedy, then the applicable real property transfer
        documents shall reflect any environmental notices, restrictions, and/or other
        environmental-related requirements identified as part of the selected remedy in a DD.
        Where a state has a requirement for an environmental covenant or environmental
        easement, consult with SAF/GCN for guidance. In general, the Air Force will sign a
        notice of restriction but not an environmental easement or covenant. All
        environmental provisions related to property transfer shall be coordinated with
        AFCEC/CZR or AFCEC/CIB, as appropriate, to ensure the provisions accurately
        conform to requirements of any applicable RODs, orders, or agreements. Mandatory
        provisions addressing environmental covenants pursuant to CERCLA Section 120(h)
        for real property disposal are contained in DODI 4165.72, Real Property Disposal.
        15.3.2.2.4. Maintain a database of areas restricted by LUCs and all Air Force
        implementation, maintenance, and monitoring responsibilities.
        15.3.2.2.5. Coordinate with local authorities and new property owners as appropriate.
        Post-transfer, primary responsibility for implementing, maintaining, monitoring, and
        reporting on the status of LUCs normally rests with the property owner unless the
        cleanup is continuing and the Air Force has retained such responsibilities. If the new
        owner fails to properly implement, maintain, and monitor the LUCs, the Air Force
        may be required by applicable DD(s), order(s), or agreement(s) to itself maintain the
 60                                                          AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


          LUC or take other corrective measures. Regardless of provisions addressing the
          allocation of responsibilities between the Air Force and a property owner, the Air
          Force is normally ultimately responsible for the protectiveness of the remedy.
          Consequently, the Air Force has a strong interest in ensuring the new owner properly
          implements, maintains, and monitors the LUCs. To address any future concerns about
          a property, AFCEC/CIB should retain any DDs, agreements, and real property
          transfer-related documents that specify LUC responsibilities.
          15.3.2.2.6. Modify or terminate LUCs through the same process used to establish the
          LUC. Responsibility for who can request, approve, process and pay for costs related
          to modifying or terminating LUCs should be identified in real estate transfer and/or
          environmental documents. Where previous DDs need to be revised, a note to the file,
          Explanation of Significant Differences, or DD amendment (or equivalent DDs under
          RCRA or other cleanup regime) are used to select and document changes to the
          selected remedy, including details regarding LUCs at the site. If a LUC is terminated,
          AFCEC/CIB shall cooperate in having it removed from any formal recording
          mechanisms (e.g., environmental easement) normally at owner expense.
          15.3.2.2.7. On occasion, a use restriction can be imposed for reasons other than
          environmental restoration and in documents other than a DD, such as but not limited
          to, deeds. If an installation is imposing a restriction for reasons other than a remedial
          requirement (e.g., administrative convenience, risk management not mandated as part
          of a cleanup decision), it should be clear in the referencing documents that the
          restriction is not part of a selected remedy. These types of restrictions would also be
          outside of any five-year review.
   15.3.3. For any evaluation of cleanup action alternatives where a LUC will be imposed
   through the environmental restoration process, either as a stand-alone response alternative or
   as one component of a more complex action, the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s),
   AFCEC/CIB, and NGB/A7O shall:
      15.3.3.1. Ensure that the evaluation of response alternatives includes an analysis of an
      alternative with unlimited use and unrestricted exposure, including life-cycle costs.
      15.3.3.2. Institute a process to review and evaluate the effect on human health and the
      environment of any proposed land use changes for areas covered by LUCs. Such land use
      changes, if inconsistent with LUC restrictions, may require re-evaluation of the selected
      remedy and modification of the DD.
      15.3.3.3. Five-year reviews and long-term management of environmental restoration
      sites provide convenient opportunities to concurrently review LUCs. During a five-year
      review, the LUCs shall also be reviewed for continued effectiveness (e.g., assess whether
      current zoning and land use are still consistent with use restrictions).
15.4. Interim Land Use Controls
   15.4.1. If it is determined in the CERCLA PA/SI (or by an equivalent process under other
   legal authorities) that contamination warrants further response action and there is potential
   for unacceptable use and exposure, then interim LUCs shall be, at a minimum,
   administratively imposed (i.e., not documented in a DD) to ensure base-wide awareness of
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                 61


   the contamination, and entered in the appropriate installation planning documents. In
   addition, other LUCs outlined in paragraph 15.2 shall be implemented when appropriate.
   15.4.2. When a final remedy is chosen for the site, interim administrative LUCs may be
   removed if they are no longer necessary to protect human health or the environment or to
   protect the effectiveness of the remedy. If interim LUCs are retained as part of the final
   remedy, those LUCs shall be documented as part of the remedy in the DD.
15.5. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)/Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The
Air Force may enter into an MOA or MOU with state regulatory agencies and/or EPA
concerning LUCs only when the regulators insist on such agreements. Such MOAs and MOUs
are voluntary and are not legally enforceable, but they do formalize the regulators’ roles and
expectations in consultation, notice, and review and comment during LUC selection,
implementation, maintenance, and review. Also see paragraph 13.2.
 62                                                           AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


                                           Chapter 16

                              PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

16.1. Reporting Environmental Indicators. The EPA maintains environmental indicators as
measures related to the ERP. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s) and AFCEC/CIB shall be
proactive in providing information or data about their restoration program’s environmental
indicators to the appropriate regulator. Every effort should be made to eliminate any “insufficient
information” or “no status” listings, and correct inaccurate and incomplete EPA data.
16.2. Performance Management Reviews. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s) and
AFCEC/CIB will provide periodic reviews of program performance metrics to HQ USAF/A4C
and SAF/IEE.
16.3. Optimization of the Restoration Program. During the analysis of remedial alternatives,
the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, and NGB/A7O will consider ways to
evaluate and improve the remedy over time. The optimization process continues through the
operating life of the remedy to the end state condition that was defined as the final environmental
restoration objective(s). Such an evaluation may be a part of required reviews, such as the 5-year
review.
16.4. Five-Year Reviews
   16.4.1. Five-year reviews shall be conducted if a selected remedial action results in any
   hazardous substances, pollutants or contaminants remaining on the site at response
   completion at levels that do not allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. (T-0).
       16.4.1.1. If a remedial action will result in unlimited use and unrestricted exposure, but
       will not achieve RC within five years, the Air Force, as a matter of policy, will conduct
       one or more five-year reviews during the RA-O phase, as appropriate, until unlimited use
       and unrestricted exposure levels are achieved.
       16.4.1.2. If a response is being conducted under a cleanup authority other than
       CERCLA, such as RCRA corrective action, as a matter of policy, five-year reviews or a
       similar evaluation shall be conducted at least every five years, unless there is a governing
       authority that has a more stringent review requirement. Reviews will be consistent with
       applicable legal requirements, agreements, permits, or orders. Reviews should be
       streamlined and tailored to consider applicable regulator guidance and the complexity of
       the remaining cleanup requirements (e.g., LUCs do not require extensive documentation).
       16.4.1.3. The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB or NGB/A7O, as
       appropriate, prepares the draft and final five-year reviews. Legal review by
       AFLOA/JACE and/or SAF/GCN is required prior to providing five-year reviews to
       regulators for review and comment. Address regulator comments pertaining to remedy
       protectiveness and include them and their disposition in the final five-year review report.
       Addressing comments in the report not pertaining to remedy protectiveness, as well as
       including any information unrelated to a site falling within paragraph 16.4.1. is
       discretionary. Five-year review reports are not considered a primary document, unless
       specified otherwise in an FFA, and are final upon Air Force signature.
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                       63


  16.4.2. The first review will be completed no later than five years after the initiation of an
  interim or a final remedial action (e.g., start of remedial action construction or after Air Force
  signs the DD) for the first site at the installation requiring a five-year review. Subsequent
  reviews will be completed within each five year period (e.g., five years, ten years, fifteen
  years) after initiation of the remedial action. The Air Force may group applicable sites into
  one five-year review, the timetable of which shall be established IAW the first site requiring
  a five-year review. Contracts for reviews shall be awarded in sufficient time before the
  review due date to allow for streamlined and tailored internal and regulatory reviews.
  Sufficient time must also be allotted for initial and final drafts under relevant cleanup
  agreements.
  16.4.3. Cost efficiency shall be evaluated at the time of the five-year review. (T-1). This
  review should include evaluating the selected remedy’s ability to reduce or eliminate long-
  term Air Force environmental liabilities as well as costs for sites with residual contamination
  that do not allow for unlimited use and unrestricted exposure. The evaluation should consider
  the cost-benefit analysis. This analysis is used for cleanup decision making, and is not part of
  the five-year review report that is submitted to the regulators.
  16.4.4. Reviews shall continue until unlimited use and unrestricted exposure have been
  attained at the property. If unlimited use and unrestricted exposure are achieved for any site
  on the property, that site no longer needs to be included in the five-year review. Such a
  determination will be documented in the first five-year review for that particular site after
  unlimited use and unrestricted exposure are achieved.
  16.4.5. For property transferred outside of Air Force control.
     16.4.5.1. If the property is being transferred to another federal government entity, the
     transferring documentation clearly specifies environmental responsibilities by the
     accepting entity (which would normally include all CERCLA responsibilities, including
     five-year reviews).
     16.4.5.2. If property is being transferred outside United States government ownership or
     control, the transferring documentation clearly specifies the Air Force and recipient’s
     environmental responsibilities. While generally the Air Force cannot relinquish its
     statutory responsibility for five-year reviews, it can require a property owner to provide
     monitoring and supporting information or data to support the five-year review.
  16.4.6. Remedy changes determined as necessary to protect human health and the
  environment, or as necessary to reflect changes that alter the basic features of the selected
  remedy must be made via a DD modification as discussed in paragraph 14.7.
  16.4.7. See DODM 4715.20, paragraph 5 of Enclosure 3 for additional information.
  16.4.8. Use OSWER Directive 9355.7-03B-P, Comprehensive Five-Year Review Guidance,
  June 2001, as a guide for meeting the statutory requirements of conducting five-year reviews,
  and EPA’s Five-Year Review Summary Form, November 2011, for a five-year review
  template.

                                          Chapter 17

                      COMPLETING RESTORATION ACTIVITIES

17.1. Response Complete (RC). Consistent with CERCLA, DERP, and applicable EOs and
regulations, the Air Force can achieve RC for IRP sites or MRSs in any one of the following
ways:
   17.1.1. Where response actions are required, the remedy is in place and remedial action
   objectives have been met as specified in the DD;
   17.1.2. The DDs (after RI/FS) show that no action or no further action is required; or
   17.1.3. At a pre-RI phase (PA or SI), the Air Force has determined that no action, or no
   further action, is required.
17.2. Remedial Action Completion Report (RACR). The appropriate AFCEC/CZ division,
AFCEC/CIB, or NGB/A7O shall develop a RACR, or RCRA corrective action completion report
if the response was conducted under RCRA, to formally document that remedial action
objectives have been achieved. (T-0). These reports formally document the achievement of
remedial action objectives and actions and that protectiveness has been achieved. In addition, the
RACR provides the basis for full or partial deletion from the NPL. See DOD/EPA Joint
Guidance on Streamlined Site Closeout and NPL Deletion Process for DOD Facilities for more
information.
   17.2.1. EPA review and approval of a RACR is required at NPL sites. The appropriate
   AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, or NGB/A7O will begin the process to obtain and
   document regulator agreement on a RACR once a site achieves RC. Documentation of
   regulatory agreement includes written agreement in the form of a dated, official letter or
   email from the regulator of appropriate authority reflecting agreement and official sanction of
   the RC determination.
   17.2.2. For NPL and non-NPL sites, if regulator concurrence has not been obtained after one
   year of reasonable attempts to obtain regulatory agreement, a memorandum for the record
   (MFR) to document the RC determination will be accomplished. The MFR shall include the
   steps followed to seek regulatory agreement; the reason(s) the Air Force believes it did not
   obtain agreement; the reason(s) for determining the site is at RC and any necessary
   documentation to support the RC determination; and the signature by the applicable
   AFCEC/CZ division chief, AFCEC/CIB or NGB/A7O, and signature and date. The MFR
   should be detailed enough to enable a reasonable person to draw the same conclusion about
   the RC determination as the individual who makes the original determination (reference to
   the RACR should suffice for this purpose). A copy of the MFR will be provided to the
   appropriate regulator(s), and if applicable, the Installation Commander.
   17.2.3. RACRs under CERCLA are signed by the same office as has authority to sign DDs.
   Installation Commanders normally sign RCRA corrective action completion reports.
   17.2.4. At all NPL facilities, EPA must review and approve the RACR, and appropriate state
   and local agencies must be provided review and comment opportunities. Unless specified as
   such in an FFA, the RACR is not a primary document. If not a primary document in an FFA,
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    65


   the EPA and states should be given 60 days to review and provide comment on the RACR,
   unless otherwise determined by appropriate binding agreement.
   17.2.5. At non-NPL facilities, the Air Force shall formally document achieving the RC
   milestone in a RACR or RCRA corrective action completion report, as appropriate, and shall
   seek written regulator agreement for its RC determinations.
   17.2.6. The RACR and RCRA corrective action completion report can serve as the After-
   Action Report for submittal to HQ AFSEC/SEW and DDESB detailing munitions response
   activities.
   17.2.7. Protectiveness of remedies for purposes of a RACR or RCRA corrective action
   completion report is determined in the same manner as it is for five-year reviews.
17.3. Site Closeout. The Air Force achieves site closeout when environmental restoration goals
have been achieved that allow unlimited use and unrestricted exposure of the property (e.g., no
further LTM, including LUCs, is required) and it will not expend additional environmental
restoration funds (i.e., ERA, AF or equivalent BRAC account funds) at the site. Sites should only
be coded as SC when there is no requirement to track either LUCs or similar restrictions and
there is no continuing requirement to conduct 5-year reviews. An NFA explosive safety
submission is required to achieve site closeout for MRAs and MRSs through HQ AFSEC/SEW
and DDESB, to be processed by the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB or
NGB/A7O. (T-0).
17.4. Re-opened Sites. Any site previously determined to have achieved remedial action
objectives and where circumstances have changed so that existing remedies are no longer
protective shall be considered a “re-opened environmental restoration site.” For sites in LTM
phases, such a re-opening could occur, for example, based on the conclusions from LTM actions
or five-year reviews. Additional response action requirements at such sites shall be programmed
and budgeted under the same obligation authority under which the previous response actions
were conducted, except under the conditions described in paragraph 6.4. The appropriate
AFCEC/CZ division chief, AFCEC/CIB or NGB/A7O approves the reopening of existing sites
for inclusion in the program, and ensures appropriate reporting and notifications are made to the
regulators. (Note: For releases discovered at previously closed sites, these sites will be
considered a “new environmental restoration site” and not a “re-opened environmental
restoration site.”)
 66                                                          AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


                                          Chapter 18

                              EMERGING CONTAMINANTS

18.1. Emerging Contaminants (EC). ECs are contaminants characterized by a possible
pathway to enter the environment and that present a potential unacceptable human health or
environmental risk. ECs are contaminants that either do not have promulgated regulatory
standards based on peer-reviewed science, or contaminants that do have promulgated regulatory
standards but it is reasonably anticipated that such standards may change due to new science,
detection capabilities, or pathways. Possible triggers for classifying a contaminant as an EC
include additional exposure pathways or new information about such pathways; changed
analyses or analytical methods; and new information concerning receptor impacts. Other
potential triggers for classifying a contaminant as an EC include regulator requests for more
information, data, or analyses based on a reasonable belief that an unaddressed risk may be
presented by that contaminant; proposed reviews and actions resulting from the AFCEC
surveillance process; or potential costs and schedule impacts to the ERP.
18.2. Decision Process for EC Responses
   18.2.1. Air Force ERP enterprise-wide response to EC is designed to promote consistent
   response actions, facilitate identification of funding requirements for programming purposes,
   and outline how technical program elements will provide support for analysis, risk
   assessment, and decision making.
       18.2.1.1. Policy and strategic direction for enterprise-wide ERP response actions for ECs
       must be issued by SAF/IEE and be consistent with DODI 4715.18, Emerging
       Contaminants.
       18.2.1.2. If release of an emerging contaminant is above applicable screening values
       (e.g., has the potential for exceeding unacceptable risk levels based on current
       knowledge), determine if a drinking water source has been, or may be, impacted, and
       confirm whether an actual human exposure pathway exists. At active installations and
       ANG facilities, when results indicate potential human exposure, the appropriate
       AFCEC/CZ division(s) or NGB/A7O, as applicable, will coordinate with the
       Bioenvironmental Engineer if there is potential contamination of a drinking water supply.
       18.2.1.3. When warranted, a site-specific risk assessment will be accomplished to
       evaluate the extent of actual or potential exposure and risk. Risk shall be assessed using
       appropriate toxicity values approved by AFCEC/CZT IAW Enclosure 3 of DODI
       4715.18 and promulgated requirements that would be considered ARARs for the specific
       site at issue.
       18.2.1.4. IAW Enclosure 4 of DODI 4715.18, necessary response actions for ECs should
       be determined by a baseline risk assessment that integrates the toxicological data with
       site-specific exposure factors to provide the basis for determining the extent of the risk.
       Any decision to undertake response actions must also be in accordance with applicable
       legal requirements and this Instruction.
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                    67


   18.2.2. Actions related to sampling.
      18.2.2.1. Regulatory requests for sampling and decisions to conduct environmental
      investigations or response actions for ECs will be addressed on a case-by-case basis in
      consultation with AFLOA/JACE and IAW legal requirements, EC-specific guidance, if
      available, and this Instruction.
      18.2.2.2. Upon request to evaluate an EC for potential response actions, the appropriate
      AFCEC/CZ division(s), AFCEC/CIB, or NGB/A7O must ascertain whether applicable
      and relevant or appropriate state and/or local requirements would require such an
      evaluation or potential response actions(s) IAW this Instruction.
      18.2.2.3. AFCEC/CZR, AFCEC/CIB or NGB/A7O, as applicable, will coordinate with
      AFLOA/JACE before authorizing sampling. The frequency and scope of sampling is
      limited to what is authorized.
      18.2.2.4. For active installations and ANG facilities, if the request for testing or actual
      testing involves direct exposure of Air Force personnel (e.g., air, drinking water), the
      appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s) or NGB/A7O, as applicable, will coordinate
      appropriate sampling with AFCEC/CZT, the local Bioenvironmental Engineer, and
      USAFSAM under the applicable cleanup framework. At BRAC locations, AFCEC/CIB
      and applicable Air Force offices will coordinate with regulatory agencies and tenants as
      required and appropriate under the applicable cleanup framework (normally CERCLA or
      RCRA).
      18.2.2.5. Toxicity information used in human health risk assessments must be consistent
      with the NCP (e.g. 40 CFR 300.430(e)(2)(i)) and the Toxicity Hierarchy in OSWER
      Directive 9285.7-53, Human Health Toxicity Values in Superfund Risk Assessments) and
      DODI 4715.18. Further, AFCEC EC-specific guidance should also be followed as
      applicable.
      18.2.2.6. When results of a site-specific review indicate a requirement for substantial
      sampling and investigation or that the selected remedy is not protective, notify,
      coordinate, and obtain authorization from AFCEC/CZ division(s) or NGB/A7O, as
      applicable, in coordination with AFCEC/CZT (for active installations and ANG facilities)
      or AFCEC/CIB (for BRAC locations) prior to any related action.
18.3. Five-Year Reviews
   18.3.1. During the five-year review, it is appropriate to examine whether a change in a
   contaminant’s risk information or new information about exposure pathways, such as vapor
   intrusion, warrants further investigation at the site. Five-year reviews are discussed in
   paragraph 16.4.
   18.3.2. Under CERCLA, if an EC and appropriate exposure pathways were evaluated in a
   completed health risk assessment approved by the lead regulatory agency (typically as part of
   an RI/FS), and there is a completed DD for the site, then the risk assessment or the DD shall
   be reopened or revised only IAW 40 CFR 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(B)(1) for changed ARARs. For
   ECs for which cleanup levels were originally risk-based, remedies specified in the DD will
   be reopened only when the original risk-based cleanup level is no longer protective.

  18.3.3. For ECs with new toxicity levels or health standards and that were not evaluated in a
  risk assessment or a DD, the appropriate AFCEC/CZ division(s) or NGB/A7O, as applicable,
  in coordination with AFCEC/CZT, or AFCEC/CIB shall evaluate the risk and recommend
  appropriate follow-up action consistent with applicable legal requirements and this
  Instruction.

1954 as presently codified in 42 USC § 2121(b), which includes quantities of special nuclear
material or atomic weapons delivered to DOD for such use as deemed necessary in the interest of
national defense. The AEA also authorizes DOD to manufacture, produce, or acquire any atomic
weapon or utilization facility for military purposes; however, such authorization shall not extend
to the production of special nuclear material other than that incidental to the operation of such
utilization facilities.
Administrative Record—Compiled information, located at or near the facility and available to
the public, that contains the documents that form the basis for the selection of a response action
(described in 40 CFR 300.800 to 300.825).
Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)—The ATSDR conducts public
health activities at NPL and petitioned sites. CERCLA requires that ATSDR complete a
preliminary PHA within one year of a site’s proposed listing on the NPL. ATSDR may also
perform risk assessments when petitioned by individuals or licensed physicians.
Applicable or Relevant and Appropriate Requirements (ARAR)—Per 40 CFR 300.5,
“applicable requirements means those cleanup standards, standards of control, and other
substantive requirements, criteria, or limitations promulgated under Federal environmental or
state environmental or facility-siting laws that specifically address a hazardous substance,
pollutant, contaminant, remedial action, location, or other circumstance found at a CERCLA site.
Only those state standards that are identified by a state in a timely manner and that are more
stringent than Federal requirements may be applicable.” “Relevant and appropriate requirements
means those cleanup standards, standards of control, and other substantive requirements, criteria,
or limitations promulgated under Federal environmental or state environmental or facility-siting
laws that, while not “applicable” to a hazardous substance, pollutant, contaminant, remedial
action, location, or other circumstance at a CERCLA site, address problems or situations
sufficiently similar to those encountered at the CERCLA site that their use is well suited to the
 78                                                          AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


particular site. Only those state standards that are identified in a timely manner and are more
stringent than Federal requirements may be relevant and appropriate.”
BRAC locations—Installations that are being or have been closed, or are being realigned by

pertains to DSMOAs, a CA is an agreement between a state and USACE Grants Officer on
behalf of the United States that defines the financial assistance available for reimbursement of a
state’s eligible services under the DSMOA for the specified CA period, the installations in the
state’s DSMOA/CA program, and any terms affecting that funding or its use. The CA is
comprised of two parts: (1) the application from the state submitted to the USACE DSMOA
team, and (2) the agreement incorporating approval of the state’s application, modified where
necessary, signed by the USACE DSMOA Grants Officer.
Cost to Complete (CTC)—The estimated costs remaining at DERP sites, covering the period
beginning October 1 of the upcoming FY through the Site Closeout milestone.
Decision Document (DD)—A generic name for the document that selects a response action
under all legal authorities. All DDs, including PPs and RODs, must go through legal and
technical review. The remedial action objectives defined in the DD will be used later in the
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                     79


environmental restoration process to confirm and demonstrate that DOD has met the obligations
established in the DD.
Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP)—A program establishing authorities
and responsibilities for conducting environmental restoration activities at facilities under DOD
jurisdiction. This law establishes DOD and Component ERAs to fund DERP activities (10 USC
§ 2701 et seq.). The Air Force conducts its DERP activities as the ERP.
Defense Site—As defined in 10 USC § 2710(e)(1), “locations that are or were owned by, leased
to, or otherwise possessed or used by the DOD. The term does not include any operational range,
operating storage or manufacturing facility, or facility that is used for or was permitted for the
treatment or disposal of military munitions.”
Defense and State Memorandum of Agreement (DSMOA)—An agreement between a state
and the DOD that establishes a partnership for environmental restoration fostering
communication and cooperation on specified installations. The DSMOA provides for
reimbursement to the state by DOD for costs of providing specified types of assistance (eligible
services) for environmental restoration at specified DOD facilities.
Delineation—Determination of the length, depth and width of impact to soil, groundwater,
surface water, and sediment.
Discarded Military Munitions (DMM)—As defined in 10 USC § 2710(e)(2), “military
munitions that have been abandoned without proper disposal or removed from storage in a
military magazine or other storage area for the purpose of disposal. The term does not include
UXO, military munitions that are being held for future use or planned disposal, or military
munitions that have been properly disposed of consistent with applicable environmental laws and
regulations.”
eDASH—online tool (known as VEMO for the Air National Guard) supporting day-to-day
requirements of the federally, DOD, and Air Force mandated environmental management
system. eDASH is the primary one-stop-source for communications and information
management of Air Force environmental and sustainability programs. (The Air Force Restoration

https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/edash/Web%20Part%20Pages%20%20Program%20Pages/Envir
onmental/Environmental%20Restoration.aspx)
Emerging Contaminants (EC)—ECs are contaminants that either (1) do not have regulatory
standards based on peer-reviewed science, or (2) contaminants that have the regulatory standards
which may change due to new science, detection capabilities, or pathways.
Enforcement Action (EA)—A formal, written notification by the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) or other authorized federal, state, inter-state, regional or local environmental
regulatory agency of violation of any applicable statutory or regulatory requirement.

 80                                                           AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


A DOD environmental liability exists when: (1) contamination is present or likely to be present;
(2) environmental cleanup, closure, and/or disposal is required by lease, contract, federal, state,
and/or local statute, regulation, or other legal agreement; and (3) the operations that created the
liability are DOD related. An environmental liability may also exist if environmental
contamination is not DOD related, but DOD enters into a binding agreement that formally
accepts financial responsibility for cleanup, closure, and/or disposal. (DOD 7000.14-R, Vol 4,
Chapter 13)
Environmental Resources Program Information Management System (ERPIMS)—The Air
Force system for validation and management of data from environmental projects at all Air Force
locations. This data contains analytical chemistry samples, tests, and results, as well as,
hydrogeological information, site/location descriptions, and monitoring well characteristics.
Environmental Restoration Account–Air Force (ERA, AF)—The primary source of funding
for most environmental restoration activities, as established under 10 USC § 2703. With respect
to active installations, DERP statutory 10 USC 2703(g) states “[except as provided in 10 USC
2703(h), certain BRAC cleanups], the sole source of funds for all phases of an environmental
remedy at a site under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense or a formerly used defense
site shall be the applicable environmental restoration account established under subsection (a).”

equipment, pipe or pipeline (including any pipe into a sewer or publicly owned treatment works),
well, pit, pond, lagoon, impoundment, ditch, landfill, storage container, motor vehicle, rolling
stock, or aircraft, or any site or area where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored,
disposed of, or placed, or otherwise come to be located; but does not include any consumer
product in consumer use or any vessel.”
Federal Action—An action that is implemented or funded directly by the United States
government. A Federal action does not include actions in which the United States participates in
an advisory, information-gathering, representational, or diplomatic capacity but does not
implement or fund the action; actions taken by a foreign government or in a foreign country in
which the United States is a beneficiary of the action, but does not implement or fund the action;
or actions in which foreign governments use funds derived indirectly from US funding.
Federal Facility Agreement (FFA)—An agreement between a DOD Component and EPA that
incorporates and may expand on the CERCLA requirements for an IAG. An FFA establishes
roles and responsibilities of the parties involved. Negotiated FFAs govern Air Force obligations
at many NPL sites. See also “Interagency Agreement.”
General Plan—The document that provides the Installation Commander and other decision-
makers a condensed picture of an installation’s capability to support the mission with its physical
assets and delivery systems. It is a general assessment of the installation’s infrastructure and
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                         81


attributes for the purpose of gauging development potential. (See AFI 32-7062 for more
information.)
Interagency Agreement (IAG)—Formal documents in which two or more Federal agencies
agree to cooperate. Pursuant to 42 USC § 9620 (e), for any installation listed on the NPL, the
Component must enter into a CERCLA IAG within 180 days of the required EPA review of the
RI/FS.
Installation—“A base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other
activity under the jurisdiction of the DOD, including any leased facility, that is located within the
United States. Does NOT include FUDS or any facility used primarily for civil works, rivers and
harbors projects, or flood control projects.” (DODM 4715.20)
IRM activities—“Actions taken, as appropriate, to reduce potentially significant threats to
human health at a site where DOD does not expect to conduct an investigation, removal action,
or remedial action for an extended period of time. IRM activities may include, but are not limited
to: notifying property owners, placing signage, conducting community outreach and education
programs, coordinating with local government officials, or requesting others to take actions for
matters within their control. IRM activities, which the DOD Components may implement
individually or layered, will vary based on the site-specific conditions and the available site
information. IRM activities do not include removal actions (e.g., fencing, providing drinking
water) or remedial actions, and the DOD Components should continue to follow the
requirements of the NCP for response actions.” (DODI 4715.07)
Joint Execution Plan (JEP)—A mutually agreed (state and AFCEC/CZ or AFCEC/CIB) plan
of action for DSMOA eligible state services to be provided for each installation listing type of
funds to be used, the DOD Component involved, milestones, environmental restoration actions,
state tasks, estimated dates that state involvement will be required, and the current status for each
milestone/task. The JEP should mirror information in the installation MAP. The JEP form also
includes space for the state to later insert information concerning state services provided.
Land Use Control (LUC)—Any type of physical, legal, proprietary or administrative
mechanism that restricts the use of, or limits access to, real property to prevent or reduce risks to
human health and the environment. Physical mechanisms (i.e., engineering controls) encompass
a variety of engineered remedies to contain or reduce contamination and physical barriers to limit
access to property, such as landfill caps, fences, or signs. The legal, proprietary, or administrative
mechanisms used for LUCs are generally the same as those used for ICs, as discussed in the
National Contingency Plan. Examples of ICs include deed notices; IC registries, property
easements and covenants; installation administrative controls, such as construction and work
request review and approval processes; and administrative orders and cleanup agreements.
Long-Term Management (LTM)—“Environmental monitoring, review of site conditions, and
maintenance of a remedial action to ensure continued protection as designed once a site achieves
Response Complete. LTM includes O&M, which are the measures required to maintain the
effectiveness of response actions. LTM should not be used until no further environmental
restoration response actions are appropriate or anticipated. LTM should not be used to refer to
monitoring after Remedy in Place (this includes sites for which the selected response action is
natural attenuation). Examples of LTM include landfill cap maintenance, leachate disposal, fence
monitoring and repair, management of five-year review execution, and LUC maintenance.”
(DODM 4715.20)

Management—Management actions should ensure that decisions and resource requirements are
developed and executed so that program execution is consistent with and achieves overall policy,
strategic direction and guidance, and priorities (IAW the SOP for the SAF/IE and HQ
USAF/A4). Management activities include, but are not limited to, determining whether cleanup
decisions are appropriate; ensuring financial and personnel resources are being used in an
effective and efficient manner; designing priorities and decisions to be consistent across the ERP
program; fostering good quality technical approaches in data gathering, evaluation, and decision
making; and reviewing and evaluating past practices and decisions to recommend future
improvements.
Military Munitions—As defined in 10 USC § 101(e)(4), “all ammunition products and
components produced for or used by the armed forces for national defense and security,
including ammunition products or components under the control of the Department of Defense,
the Coast Guard, the Department of Energy, and the National Guard. Such term includes the
following: (i) Confined gaseous, liquid, and solid propellants. (ii) Explosives, pyrotechnics,
chemical and riot control agents, smokes, and incendiaries, including bulk explosives, and
chemical warfare agents. (iii) Chemical munitions, rockets, guided and ballistic missiles, bombs,
warheads, mortar rounds, artillery ammunition, small arms ammunition, grenades, mines,
torpedoes, depth charges, cluster munitions and dispensers, and demolition charges. (iv) Devices
and components of any item specified in clauses (i) through (iii). Such term does not include the
following: (i) Wholly inert items. (ii) Improvised explosive devices. (iii) Nuclear weapons,
nuclear devices, and nuclear components, other than non-nuclear components of nuclear devices
that are managed under the nuclear weapons program of the Department of Energy after all
required sanitization operations under 42 USC § 2011 et seq. have been completed.”
Munitions Constituents (MC)—As defined in 10 USC § 2710(e)(3), “any materials originating
from UXO, DMM, or other military munitions, including explosive and non-explosive materials,
and emission, degradation, or breakdown elements of such ordnance or munitions.”
Munitions Response—As defined in 32 CFR subpart 179.3, “response actions, including
investigation, removal actions, and remedial actions, to address the explosives safety, human
health, or environmental risks presented by UXO, DMM, or MC, or to support a determination
that no removal or remedial action is required.”
Munitions Response Area (MRA)—As defined in 32 CFR subpart 179.3, “any area on a
defense site that is known or suspected to contain UXO, DMM, or MC. Examples are former
ranges and munitions burial areas. An MRA comprises one or more MRSs.”
Munitions Response Site (MRS)—As defined in 32 CFR subpart 179.3, “a discrete location
within an MRA that is known to require a munitions response.”
Munitions Response Site Prioritization Protocol (MRSPP)—Per DUSD(I&E) Munitions
Response Site Prioritization Protocol Primer, a tool adopted by DOD to assign a relative priority
for munitions responses to each location in the Department’s inventory of defense sites known or
suspected of containing UXO, DMM, or MC.
National Contingency Plan (NCP)—The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution
Contingency Plan, commonly referred to as the NCP, 40 CFR Part 300, is a set of regulations
setting forth procedures that lead agencies must follow when implementing CERCLA and
similar response authorities under the Clean Water Act.
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                       83


National Priorities List (NPL)—A formal list of the nation’s sites that pose the greatest
potential risks, as established by CERCLA. NPL sites are priorities for response actions under
CERCLA. For Federal facilities on the NPL, the Federal agency must enter an IAG with EPA.
Natural Resources—Per 40 CFR Part 300.5, “land, fish, wildlife, biota, air, water, groundwater,
drinking water supplies, and other such resources belonging to, managed by, held in trust by,
pertaining to, or otherwise controlled by the United States (including the resources of the
exclusive economic zone defined by the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act
of 1976), any state or local government, any foreign government, any Native American tribe, or,
if such resources are subject to a trust restriction on alienation, any member of an Indian tribe.”
Natural Resource Injury—The actual harm to a natural resource caused by a release of a
CERCLA “hazardous substance.” This term is to be distinguished from “Natural Resource
Damages,” which are money damages whose purpose is to restore, replace or acquire the
equivalent of any such injured natural resources or the services they provide.
No Further Response Action Planned (NFRAP)—Under CERCLA, a signed NFRAP report is
a determination during the PA/SI that no further action is necessary as the site poses no threat to
human health and the environment due either to the absence of releases or because the risk is
acceptable for all use and exposure scenarios. The report which documents this must address, at
a minimum, the requirements specified in 40 CFR 300.420(b)(4) or (c)(5) as appropriate.
Operational Range—As defined in 10 USC § 101(e)(3), “a range that is under the jurisdiction,
custody, or control of the Secretary of a military department and that is used for range activities,
or although not currently being used for range activities, that is still considered by the Secretary
to be a range and has not been put to a new use that is incompatible with range activities.”
Includes “active ranges” and “inactive ranges” as defined by the military munitions rule, 40 CFR
266.201.
Operation—A military action or the carrying out of a strategic, tactical, service, training, or
administrative military mission; the process of carrying on combat, including movement, supply,
attack, defense, and maneuvers needed to gain the objectives of any battle or campaign.
Other than Operational Range—As defined in 10 USC § 2710(e)(1), “locations that are or
were owned by, leased to, or otherwise possessed or used by the DOD. The term does not
include any operational range, operating storage or manufacturing facility, or facility that is used
for or was permitted for the treatment or disposal of military munitions.” (same as Defense Site)
Policy—Policy is a statement of important, high-level direction that guides decisions and actions
throughout the Air Force. Policy translates the ideas, goals, or principles contained in the
mission, vision, and strategic plans into actionable directives. (Also see the SOP for the SAF/IE
and HQ USAF/A4.)
Program Oversight—Program oversight means ensuring that high-level decision-making,
programming, resource allocation, and program execution are consistent with and achieve
overall Air Force policy, strategic direction, and guidance; priorities jointly established with HQ
USAF/A4C; and legal requirements. (Also see the SOP for the SAF/IE and HQ USAF/A4.)
Public Health—The science of protecting and improving the health of communities through
education, promotion of healthy lifestyles, and research for disease and injury prevention.
 84                                                            AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


Record of Decision (ROD)—The document required by CERCLA containing the final decision
and statutory determinations of the lead agency concerning selection of the remedial action at a
site(s). This includes any preliminary phase of a remedial action, such as an interim remedial
action, which would require an interim ROD.
Relative Risk Site Evaluation (RRSE)—The RRSE framework, described in the DOD
Relative-Risk Site Evaluation Primer (Summer 1997, Revised Edition), provides a single,
consistent DOD-wide approach for evaluating the relative-risk to human health and the
environment posed by the chemical contamination present at a site. Evaluation of contaminants
present, environmental migration pathways, and receptors results in the placement of sites into
relative-risk categories of “high,” “medium,” or “low.” These categories are used in prioritizing
sites and sequencing the implementation of environmental restoration activities.
Remedial Action-Construction—“The period of time in which a response action is being
implemented but is not yet operating as designed. At the end of this phase of work, a remedy is
in place.” (DODM 4715.20)
Remedial Action Completion Report (RACR)—“At an NPL facility, a key RC document
prepared to show that remedial action objectives have been achieved at a specific site, group of
sites, or an entire installation, BRAC location, or FUDS property, as specified in the DD, and
documents that the remedy remains protective. It also serves as a basis for whole or partial NPL
deletion.” (DODM 4715.20)
Remedial Action-Operation (RA-O)—“The period of time that a selected remedy must operate
before achieving remedial action objectives. At the end of this phase of work, the response is
complete. ” (DODM 4715.20)
Remedy or Remedial Action—As defined in 40 CFR 300.5, “those actions consistent with
permanent remedy taken instead of, or in addition to, removal action in the event of a release or
threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment, to prevent or minimize the
release of hazardous substances so that they do not migrate to cause substantial danger to present
or future public health or welfare or the environment. The term includes, but is not limited to,
such actions at the location of the release as storage, confinement, perimeter protection using
dikes, trenches, or ditches, clay cover, neutralization, cleanup of released hazardous substances
and associated contaminated materials, recycling or reuse, diversion, destruction, segregation of
reactive wastes, dredging or excavations, repair or replacement of leaking containers, collection
of leachate and runoff, on-site treatment or incineration, provision of alternative water supplies,
any monitoring reasonably required to assure that such actions protect the public health and
welfare and the environment and, where appropriate, post-removal site control activities. The
term includes the costs of permanent relocation of residents and businesses and community
facilities (including the cost of providing "alternative land of equivalent value" to an Indian tribe
pursuant to CERCLA section 126(b)) where EPA determines that, alone or in combination with
other measures, such relocation is more cost-effective than, and environmentally preferable to,
the transportation, storage, treatment, destruction, or secure disposition off-site of such
hazardous substances, or may otherwise be necessary to protect the public health or welfare; the
term includes off-site transport and off-site storage, treatment, destruction, or secure disposition
of hazardous substances and associated contaminated materials. For the purpose of the NCP, the
term also includes enforcement activities related thereto.”
AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                       85


Remedial Project Manager (RPM)—The person assigned to manage remedial or other
response actions at sites in the ERP. The RPM is responsible for coordinating, directing, and
reviewing ERP work, ensuring compliance with legal requirements, and recommending
decisions on actions.
Remediation—Actions taken at a contaminated site to abate the effects of environmental
contamination on human health and safety, ecological resources or receptors (unless overseas),
and operations. These actions occur sometime after the release of pollutants into the
environment, as opposed to immediately following and in response to a release incident, and are
consistent with or intended to be the final and permanent solution for site releases.
Remedy in Place (RIP)—“Designation that a final remedial action has been constructed, is
functional, and is operating as planned in the RD and would be expected to meet the remedial
action objectives detailed in the DD. Examples of RIP are a soil vapor extraction system or an in
situ chemical treatment system that is installed and operating as designed and for which
performance data indicate the system will achieve remedial action objectives, thus demonstrating
proper operation of the system. Because remedial action objectives have not been met, the site
cannot be considered RC.” (DODM 4715.20)
Remove or Removal—“As defined by section 311(a)(8) of the CWA, refers to removal of oil or
hazardous substances from the water and shorelines or the taking of such other actions as may be
necessary to minimize or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare or to the environment.
As defined by section 101(23) of CERCLA, remove or removal means the cleanup or removal of
released hazardous substances from the environment; such actions as may be necessary taken in
the event of the threat of release of hazardous substances into the environment; such actions as
may be necessary to monitor, assess, and evaluate the release or threat of release of hazardous
substances; the disposal of removed material; or the taking of such other actions as may be
necessary to prevent, minimize, or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare or to the
environment, which may otherwise result from a release or threat of release. The term includes,
in addition, without being limited to, security fencing or other measures to limit access, provision
of alternative water supplies, temporary evacuation and housing of threatened individuals not
otherwise provided for, action taken under section 104(b) of CERCLA, post-removal site
control, where appropriate, and any emergency assistance which may be provided under the
Disaster Relief Act of 1974. For the purpose of the NCP, the term also includes enforcement
activities related thereto.” (40 CFR § 300.5)
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)—RCRA was enacted in 1976, amending
the Solid Waste Disposal Act, to address the issue of how to safely manage and dispose of the
huge volumes of municipal and industrial waste generated nationwide. Specifically, the RCRA
program regulates solid waste recycling and disposal; Federal procurement of products
containing recycled materials; waste minimization; hazardous waste generators and transporters;
hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facilities; and USTs (42 USC § 6901 et seq.).
The RCRA corrective action program for wastes addresses releases of hazardous wastes and
hazardous waste constituents from solid waste management units. The corrective action program
is principally enforced through the statutory authorities established by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments of 1984 and is substantively equivalent to CERCLA.
Respond or Response—As defined by section 101(25) of CERCLA, “remove, removal,
remedy, or remedial action, including enforcement activities related thereto.”
 86                                                          AFI32-7020 7 NOVEMBER 2014


Response Complete (RC)—A milestone signifying that the DOD Component has met the
remedial action objectives for a site, documented the determination, and sought regulatory
agreement. RC signifies that DOD has determined at the end of the PA/SI or RI that no
additional response action is required; achieved RIP and the required RA-O has achieved the
remedial action objectives; or where there is no RA-O phase, then the remedial action-
construction has achieved the remedial action objectives. LTM may occur after RC is achieved
and precedes Site Close Out.
Restoration Advisory Board (RAB)—An advisory group for the environmental restoration
program that includes members of the public, the installation, and regulatory agencies. The
purpose of a RAB is to gain effective input from stakeholders on cleanup activities and to
increase installation responsiveness to community environmental restoration concerns.
Site—A discrete location that is, or was, owned by, leased to, or otherwise possessed by the
United States and under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense, and that is known or
suspected to require remediation. A site has a unique name or identification designation given to
a distinct area of an installation containing one or more releases or threatened releases of
hazardous substances that can be treated (1) as a discrete entity for cleanup, management,
contracting, reporting, and cost accounting purposes, or (2) to consolidate a grouping for
response purposes.
Site Closeout—“The stage at which the DOD has completed active management and monitoring
at an environmental restoration site, and no additional environmental restoration funds will be
expended at the site. SC occurs when environmental restoration goals have been achieved that
allow unlimited use and unrestricted exposure of the property (e.g., no further LTM, including
LUCs, is required). Also may be a no further action.” (DODM 4715.20)
Third Party Sites (TPS)—A facility or site that is not currently, and never was owned by,
leased to, or otherwise possessed by the United States and under the jurisdiction of the DOD; at
which DOD arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances within the meaning of 42
USC § 9607(a)(3), thus DOD is a PRP under CERCLA; and at which there has been a release of
a hazardous substance.
Unexploded Explosive Ordnance (UXO)—Explosive ordnance which has been primed, fused,
armed or otherwise prepared for action, and which has been fired, dropped, launched, projected,
or placed in such a manner as to constitute a hazard to operations, installations, personnel, or
material and remains unexploded either by malfunction or design or for any other cause. (Joint
Publication 1-02)
United States—As defined in 42 USC § 9601(27), the United States “includes the several states
of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam,
American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern
Marianas, and any other territory or possession over which the United States has jurisdiction.”

* Because RCRA corrective action does not consist of a set of structured, mandatory steps, not
all of the options listed above may be appropriate for each cleanup. EPA, or an authorized state,
will select the RCRA options based upon site-specific circumstances.
