Summary of Changes

This publication consolidates MILDENHALLI 24-303, Motor Vehicle Accidents and
MILDENHALLI 24-305, Vehicle Accident and Abuse Program. Requires letter of release to
100 LRS/LGRV for all repair estimates exceeding $250.00 before Vehicle Maintenance will
initiate repair actions. For repair estimates less than $250.00, Vehicle Maintenance will initiate
2                                                  MILDENHALLI24-305 21 AUGUST 2009


repair actions immediately. All cost regardless of dollar amount will be recouped by 100
LRS/LGRV from using organization.
1. Objectives.
    1.1. The purpose of this operating instruction is to establish procedures for reporting
    government motor vehicle/equipment (GOV/E) accidents. It also addresses when operators
    will surrender driving permits, and completion of accident forms and investigations. Vehicle
    Maintenance tracks and notifies the commander and Vehicle Control Officer (VCO)/Vehicle
    Control Noncommissioned Officer (VCNCO) of the unit involved, along with base legal,
    finance, and safety offices (usually by form letter or e-mail) as applicable. Vehicle
    Management is tasked with determining effectiveness of the unit prevention program and
    discussing findings with the VCO/VCNCO during staff assistance visits. Commanders,
    supervisors and VCO/VCNCOs will ensure that all assigned personnel are familiar with this
    instruction and accident reporting procedures prior to operating any GOV/E.
    1.2. Using organizations with vehicles and/or equipment involved in an accident or abuse
    will pay for materials and/or contract costs to repair the accident/abuse damage. The primary
    method of payment will be reimbursement accomplished through a transfer of funds from the
    using organization’s operation and maintenance (O&M) account to LRS’s O&M. In some
    instances it is recognized that the using organization may not be the owning/assigned
    organization (i.e., U-Drive-It vehicles from Vehicle Operations, or a loaner vehicle from
    another unit), but the intent is for the using/operating organization to be responsible for
    repair. Unit reimbursement will be made irrespective of the determination of pecuniary
    liability or reimbursement made by the individual to the government. Unit reimbursement is
    a “budget” event, not a punishment or legal event.
2. Definitions.
    2.1. Fair Wear and Tear: The normal expected deterioration of a vehicle or equipment based
    on its age, usage and life expectancy.
    2.2. Vehicle Accident: Any situation where a GOV/E strikes or is struck by another vehicle,
    object or structure.
    2.3. Vehicle Abuse: An act or omission that has caused damage, or may cause damage and
    cannot be attributed to fair wear and tear or accident. Some examples of vehicle abuse are
    listed in Attachment 2.
    2.4. Vehicle Incident: Incidents are classified as damage caused by acts of nature, natural
    disasters, mechanical failures or other phenomenon that in no way could have been avoided
    by safe operation or adequate vehicle care during non-use. Cases of incidents may also
    include damage resulting from normal use for the vehicle’s intended purpose (e.g., snow
    removal or heavy construction work). Using organizations are not required to reimburse for
    damage caused by incidents.
3. Reporting Procedures.
    3.1. Off Base Accident: Vehicle accidents will be reported promptly. When operators are
    involved in GOV/E accidents, the following will be adhered to:
       3.1.1. Do not move the vehicle unless directed by proper authorities or it is causing a
       safety hazard.
MILDENHALLI24-305 21 AUGUST 2009                                                               3


      3.1.2. Assist the injured if possible.

      Form 349, U.S. Armed Forces Motor Vehicle Accident Report, 14 June 2006, prescribed
      by 16AFI51-501, and Department of Defense (DD) Form 518, Accident Identification
      Card, October 1978. Fill out the front side of DD Form 518 and give it to the Police
      Officer or vehicle operator if police are unavailable.
      3.1.5. Fill out Standard Form (SF) 91, Operator’s Report of Motor Vehicle Accident,
      February 1993, prescribed by GSA-FPMR101-38.6.
      3.1.6. Upon returning to base, prepare a separate statement of exactly what happened.
      Inform immediate supervisor of the accident and ensure he/she initiates a USAFE Form
      281, Supervisor’s Report of Mishap, 3 September 2000, prescribed by AFI31-204.
      3.1.7. Submit the SF 91, 3AF Form 349 and statement to VCO/VCNCOs or supervisor
      on shift.
      3.1.8. Turn the vehicle in to Vehicle Maintenance for inspection within 24 hours of
      accident, whether or not there is obvious damage. Safety related damage should be
      reported immediately.
   3.2. On Base Accidents: Follow the above procedures but contact the Security Forces
   Control Center at DSN 238-6365 instead of British Police. (NOTE: If the accident involves
   only GOV/E’s the DD Form 518 and 3AF Form 349 are not required.)
4. Accident Investigations and Procedures.
   4.1. Report U-Drive-It vehicle damage to 100 LRS/LGRDDO (Vehicle Operations) within
   24 hours. Safety related damage should be reported immediately.
   4.2. Squadron commanders or equivalent will initiate an accident/abuse investigation to
   determine circumstances of the situation, evaluate procedures/safety considerations and
   determine whether a Report of Survey (ROS) should be accomplished IAW AFMAN 23-220.
   4.3. The VCO/VCNCO conducts an investigation of the accident.
   4.4. Copies of the accident investigation report must be sent to 100 ARW Safety and 100
   ARW/FM. IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, Table 24-3, Rule 13; all unit
   VCO/VCNCOs must maintain a copy of all accident related material for six years. As a
   minimum, the following will be accomplished:
      4.4.1. Inspect the vehicle for any damage (the vehicle must be turned in to maintenance
      whether or not there is visible damage) and obtain photographs, if necessary.
      4.4.2. If private property or a privately owned vehicle (POV) is involved, copies of the
      accident package must be sent to Ministry of Defense, within 72 hours. Base Legal &
      Wing Safety will be notified accordingly.
      4.4.3. Review Operator’s & Security Force’s accident reports, operator’s statements and
      discuss the accident with the operator. Determine at this time if the individual was at
      fault, and if so, he/she may elect to voluntarily pay for damages.
4                                                  MILDENHALLI24-305 21 AUGUST 2009


       4.4.4. The Unit Commander sends the investigation to Wing Safety. The Chief of Safety
       investigates and analyzes to determine the causes or possible corrective actions.
       Accident trends involving government owned or rented motor vehicles are analyzed or
       investigated by the Chief of Safety.
       4.4.5. The investigator should make a recommendation as to whether they feel a Report
       of Survey is needed. It is mandatory in cases of gross negligence, willful misconduct or
       deliberate unauthorized use. Once the investigation report has been reviewed by the ROS
       appointing authority you will be notified if a ROS is necessary. Guidance on completion
       of a ROS can be obtained from AFMAN 23-220, Chapter 18.
       4.4.6. Vehicle operator driving privileges will be suspended and reinstated using the
       guidance contained in AFI 31-204. Base law enforcement activities, acting on behalf of
       the installation commander, administer the program.          An operator is given a
       reexamination on abilities to safely operate a vehicle when considered necessary by the
       unit commander due to an accident, evidence of abuse or misuse, moving violations or
       display of immature judgment or behavior.
       4.4.7. Sign (electronically or accident memorandum) and return vehicle release letter to
       100 LRS/VMA within five duty days if repair estimates exceed $250.00. Notify 100
