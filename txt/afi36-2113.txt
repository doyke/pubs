                                             INTRODUCTION

1.1. Roles and Responsibilities of the First Sergeant. The United States Air Force First Sergeant is an
expeditionary leader serving in a time honored special duty position, rich in cust om and tradition. The
first sergeant works directly for and derive their authority from th e unit commander at home station,
deployed commander when deployed, and serves as th e commander’s critical link within the unit for all
matters concerning enlisted members. As the vital link between the commander , enlisted personnel and
support agencies, the first sergeant must ensure the enlisted force understands the commander ’s policies,
goals, and objectives and must also ensure support agencies, i.e., securi ty forces, civil engineer, medical
facilities, services, etc., are responsive to the needs of unit personnel and their families. Additionally, first
sergeants are accountable to respond to the needs of unit members 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and may
at times, be required to work long and irregular hours, travel extensively to and from mission destinations
(The Joint Federal Travel Regulation, Volume 1, paragraph U3500, authorizes vicinity travel). They must
remain vigilant for, and use the necessary authority to resolve issues that, left unchecked, would adversely
impact readiness. The first sergeant principally leads outside the operational chain of command. As such,
first sergeants must be mindful that they seldom are the rankin g Senior Noncommissioned Officer
(SNCO) in the unit, and should therefore balance communication with the organization’s SNCOs and take
the lead in establishing effective communication with all members. Specifically, first sergeants communi-
cate with unit leadership, supervisors and members to ensure discipline is eq uitably maintained and
morale, welfare, and health needs for the enli sted force are met. T he first s ergeant serves as the com-
mander’s advisor on personnel programs, career progression, family needs, financial matters, family and
unaccompanied housing, details, Professional Military Education (PME), recognition programs and any
additional needs requ ired by the comm ander. Furthermore, the first sergeant will perform quality force
reviews and ensure timely processi ng of performance reports, awards, decorations, promotions, classifi-
cation actions, quality contro l and disciplinary actions . The first sergeant must ensure unit members are
prepared to deploy while maintaining their own pers onal readiness. Upon arrival at a deployed location,
the first sergeant must render the necessary leadership to provide an d sustain a mission-ready enlisted
force for the commander.

1.2. Professionally, first sergeants are expected to ep itomize the highest qualities of Air Force SNCOs.
These qualities require the first sergeant to always remain perceptive, credible, and exemplify the core
values of the United States Air Force. First sergeants must be proactive in the performance of their duties
demonstrating initiative, innovation and character.

1.3. In addition to responsibilities and obligations at the unit level, first sergeants must work closely with
the command chief master sergeant (CCM) to prepare the enlisted force to execute the wing and basemis-
sions. First Sergeants must also participate in a variety of activities that support the total needs of the mil-
itary community. Due to the first sergeant’s important role as a unit leader, commanders and CCMs must
ensure installation taskings and first sergeant council activities do not result in excessive time away from
the unit.

   CCM must also reiterate the initial commitment is 3 years. The interview should be of appropriate

                         FIRST SERGEANT TENURE AND ASSIGNMENT

6.1. Tenure.
   6.1.1. First sergeant special duty tenure is managed by HQ AFPC/DPAA2. First sergeants who grad-
   uated the First Ser geant Academy after 1 Oct 02 have an initial firs t sergeant special duty tour of 3
   years from graduation date. For the purposes of first sergeant special duty management, HQ AFPC/
   DPAA2 may extend a first sergeant’s tenure up to 1 year for volunteer short-tour PCS purposes. First
   sergeants who graduated from the First Sergeant Academy prior to 1 Oct 02 do not have a special duty
   termination date and are considered “grandfathered first sergeants.”
   6.1.2. First ser geants nearing the completion of their in itial 3 year tour may el ect to serve an addi-
   tional 3 year tour. They will meet with their CCM at the 24 month point of their initial tour for contin-
   ued service options. If the first ser geant does not re quest a subsequent first ser geant tour, they will
   need to follow procedures outlined in paragraph 4.5.9.1. If member is requested by their PAFSC func-
   tional manager to r eturn to their previous held AFSC, the member ’s CCM w ill be notified that the
   member must return to their previous AFSC, or retire if eligible, at the end of the 3-year tour.
   6.1.3. First sergeants may compete for assignments at any time as long as they meet PCS eligibility
   requirements and can obtain the required retainab ility for the as signment. HQ AFPC/DPAA2 will
   seek early second tour approval for those selected for assignments prior to reaching the second tour
   application window.
   6.1.4. The USAF First Se rgeant Special Duty Manager, FSA Co mmandant, FSA instructors, Air
   National Guard Firs t Sergeant Functional Manager, Air Force Reserves Co mmand First Sergeant
   Functional Manager as well as CMSg t first sergeants filling identified positions may serve beyond 6
   years. Service beyond the second 3 year special duty tour for all others will be determined by Air
   Force needs. The hiring authority determines the tenure. If ther e is not a valid Air Force need, the
   member either returns to PAFSC, retrains, applies for another special duty, or retires (if eligible).

6.2. Assignment. First sergeant assignments are managed by HQ AFPC/DPAA2 using a two-tier system.
First Tier assignments are for those in their first three-year special duty tour. Second Tier assignments are
for those in or entering their second 3 year tour. AF/DPE assigns CMSgt first sergeants.

6.3. Withdrawal Procedures.
   6.3.1. Voluntary Withdrawal.
       6.3.1.1. First sergeants who graduated the FSA prior to 1 Oct 02 do not have a special duty termi-
       nation date; therefore, they may request to return to a previous ly awarded AFSC, or another spe-
       cialty. The member advi ses their CCM, who contacts HQ AFPC/D PAA2 to initiate the action.
       Maximum lead-time and flexibility is desired, however, 6-9 month time frame is preferred. Over-
       seas first sergeants may be rest ricted based on their DEROS. Re quest for rel ease from overseas
       areas should be submitted NLT 12 months prior to DEROS. Personnel selected for assignment are
       not eligible to apply for voluntary release in lieu of the assignment. HQ AFPC/DPAA2 is the final
       approval authority for voluntary withdrawals.

        6.3.1.2. First sergeant duties are both mentally an d physically demanding. If circumstances exist
        that prove it is not in the best interest of the individual or the Air Force to continue duty as a first
        sergeant, removal or release from the special dut y is required. First ser geants who need to with-
        draw for personal/medical reasons justify the request to the CCM by submitting letter for release.
        Ensure to update assignment preferences upon submission of request. If the member’s preference
        is to remain at his/her present location, update the base’s preference code as your first choice. You
        will also need to update additional preferences ( stateside and overseas, if desired) in the event
        manning does not support you remaining at your current location.

        consideration assignment preferences listed in member ’s personnel file (MilPDS). It is not guar-
        anteed the member will be matched to a preference, as AF needs must be taken into consideration
        as well.

            inactive files after the first year.

     process the following withdrawal procedures.
        6.3.2.1. The unit commander notifies the member in writing of the proposed withdrawal, with jus-
        tification. The member has 5 duty days to request a personal appearance or submit a written state-
        ment or documents on their behalf. Member can waive this by endorsement to notification letter.
        6.3.2.2. The request for withdrawal letter, along with all information submitted by the member is
