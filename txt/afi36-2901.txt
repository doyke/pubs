This Instruction implements AFPD 36-29, Military Personnel Standards. It outlines the directive require-
ments for the Headquarters US Air Force Protocol Office (HQ USAF/CVAP) to manage itinerary arrange-
ments supporting active duty Air Force general officers who visit the Washington area. It also outlines
directive requirements for the offices of the visiting active duty Air Force general officers to the Washing-
ton DC area. It assigns protocol support for domestic protocol events and does not apply to protocol mat-
ters relating to foreign dignitaries, nor Senior Executive Service (SES) members, nor Air National Guard
(ANG) or US Air Force Reserve (USAFR) general officers. The HQ USAF Protocol Office maintains a
liaison with all major command (MAJCOM) protocol offices and all protocol offices throughout the Air
Force; however, there is no direct line of authority extending from the HQ USAF Protocol Office to any
of the other protocol offices. Each MAJCOM protocol office formulates necessary directive requirements
to support its own major commander. Therefore, the HQ USAF Protocol office functions only in an advi-
sory capacity to the field.
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This instruction more
clearly delineates responsibilities and updates appropriate telephone and room numbers and addresses.



1. Visit Notification. All active duty Air Force general officers visiting the Washington, DC area will
notify HQ USAF/CVAP. HQ USAF/CVAP personnel will, in turn, inform the offices of the Secretary of
the Air Force and the Chief of Staff (CSAF) of such visits.

2. Responsible Agency. The HQ USAF Protocol Office is designated as the agency responsible for man-
aging the Visiting Generals Program and for providing domestic protocol support for the Secretary and
Under Secretary of the Air Force, CSAF, Vice Chief, and Assistant Vice Chief of Staff.

3. Air Force Active Duty General Officers Responsibilities:
    3.1. Each active duty Air Force general officer will notify HQ USAF/CVAP of an anticipated visit to
    the Washington, DC area. This includes visits to all Air Force and outside agencies, regardless of
    whether the general officer visits the Pentagon. For example, general officers attending a conference
    at the Conference Center at Andrews Air Force Base (AFB) or visiting Fort Meade, Maryland, must
    also coordinate their trips with HQ USAF/CVAP.
    3.2. It is currently Air Force Vice Chief of Staff (AF/CV) policy that visiting general officers use
    on-base distinguished visitor quarters (DVQs) when available. When on-base lodging is available,
    but the visiting general officer believes using a commercial hotel would be more logical and advanta-
    geous to the government, his or her office must submit a request to stay off base to the office of the
    AF/CV, the approving authority. Coordinate such requests via telephone (DSN 225-7911) or fax
    (DSN 224-2693) with the Vice Chief’s office before making reservations in downtown hotels.
    3.3. The visiting generals will provide HQ USAF/CVAP with the following information:
        3.3.1. Dates, times, and mode of travel for arrival and departure.
        3.3.2. Accompanying staff officers.
        3.3.3. Purpose of the visit.
        3.3.4. Point of contact and telephone number in the Washington area.
        3.3.5. Lodging requirements.
        3.3.6. Transportation requirements.
        3.3.7. Requirements for pentagon parking, rental cars or U-drives (driver’s name and vehicle
        license plate number).
        3.3.8. Overnight classified storage requirements.
        3.3.9. Requests for appointments, reservations, or miscellaneous support.
        3.3.10. Complete itinerary.

4. HQ USAF/CVAP Responsibilities:
    4.1. The HQ USAF Protocol Office provides a daily listing to SAF/OS, SAF/US, CSAF, HQ USAF/
    CV, and HQ USAF/CVA of all active duty Air Force general officers visiting the Washington, DC
    area. SES members, Individual Mobilization Augmentees, ANG, and USAFR general officers are
    handled by the offices they are visiting.
    4.2. The HQ USAF Protocol Office coordinates with the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when the
    visitor is a Commander-in-Chief or Deputy Commander-in-Chief of a unified or specified command.
    4.3. The HQ USAF Protocol Office notifies protocol offices at Bolling and Andrews AFBs of arrival,
    departure, and related requirements of visiting active duty general officers to include transportation
    and lodging.
    4.4. The HQ USAF Protocol Office manages ceremonies, receptions, and special events to include
    funds, guest lists, invitations, dress, flags, contracts, menus, event briefs, etc., on behalf of the Secre-
    tary and Under Secretary of the Air Force, the Chief, Vice Chief, and Assistant Vice Chief of Staff.

   4.5. The HQ USAF Protocol Office researches and answers inquiries from outside offices and assists
   with protocol aspects of Air Force funerals.
   4.6. The HQ USAF Protocol Office maintains appropriate liaison with all protocol offices in the
   Department of Defense, the Washington, DC area, and outside Air Force offices. It also ensures Chief
   of Staff representation at events outside HQ USAF.
