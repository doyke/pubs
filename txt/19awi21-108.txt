                                                                    (Colonel Daniel R. Lockert)
                                                                                        Pages: 6



This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space
Maintenance, and fulfills the requirements of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-101, AIRCRAFT
AND EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT. This instruction applies to all Group
organizations assigned to the 19th Airlift Wing. Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-
363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF
Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field
through the appropriate functional chain of command.

1. Purpose. Positive control and accountability of tools, equipment, and electronic devices used
on aircraft parking, runway, hangars and taxi areas are essential for the elimination of Foreign
Object Damage (FOD). The purpose of this publication is to provide all units that require a tool
control program the necessary guidance to implement a sound program to control the tools and
equipment taken onto the airfield. Due to the diverse nature of agencies located on Little Rock
Air Force Base, this publication can only provide general guidance. To be in compliance with
this instruction, units must establish a program or demonstrate that existing programs meet the
intent of positive tool and equipment accountability and control.
2. Definitions.
   2.1. Tool: A hand-held device used in accomplishing work ( i.e., as a hammer, saw, wrench,
   drill, shovel, axe, rags, etc.)
 2                                                             19AWI21-108 18 OCTOBER 2013


     2.2. Equipment: A device required to accomplish a task or carry out work (i.e., surveyors’
     transit, portable generator, cell phone, computer, etc.)
     2.3. Airfield: Includes all areas of the installation involved in aircraft operation (i.e.,
     taxiways, parking ramps, hardstands, hangars that house aircraft, and the runway.)
3. Responsibilities.
     3.1. Unit commanders are responsible for ensuring an effective program is in place and duty
     sections are in compliance with this instruction for those that perform duties on the airfield or
     in aircraft maintenance facilities. Commanders must also ensure that contractors who work
     on the airfield or in and around aircraft maintenance facilities understand the importance of
     tool control in these areas.
     3.2. Flight chiefs/section noncommissioned officers in charge (NCOIC) (or equivalent) will:
        3.2.1. Develop/Enforce a tool accountability/control program. They may determine if
        tools/ equipment that do not dispatch out to the airfield will fall under the scope of this
        instruction.
        3.2.2. All tools/equipment that are dispatchable to the airfield/maintenance facilities that
        are used for aircraft maintenance will follow this instruction.
     3.3. Program must include an inventory process for items leaving/returning from jobs out on
     the airfield/maintenance facilities (e.g., a sign in/sign out log or automated Tool
     Accountability System (TAS)).
     3.4. Everyone who performs duties on the airfield or in and around maintenance facilities is
     responsible for safeguarding their equipment against loss by ensuring accountability before
     and after each trip. Immediately notify the 19 Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) of
     items suspected to be lost near an aircraft or in a maintenance facility.
     3.5. Once a tool control program is established, each unit will perform an annual self-
     inspection.
4. Tool Accountability.
     4.1. While not mandatory for non-aircraft maintenance units, TAS is the preferred automated
     method to effectively manage a tool control program. Any locally developed method of tool
     control (e.g., chits, locally developed forms, etc.) must follow the tool control guidelines
     established by AFI 21-101 AMC-Sup 1. Sec. 10.4.
     4.2. If TAS is used Sections must notify 19 MXG/Quality Assurance (QA) of their assigned
     Equipment Identification Designators (EID).
5. Aircrew Tool/Equipment Accountability.
     5.1. Tools and equipment used by all aircrew personnel that dispatch to the flight line will be
     controlled and inventoried. Aircrew members must account for all equipment and personal
     items after each flight and ensure that any item lost during flight is documented on the AFTO
     Form 781A for that particular aircraft. Aircrew members will assist maintenance personnel in
     searching for lost items. The Operations Group (OG) Director of Operations, due to mission
     requirements, may waive aircrew participation in the search.
19AWI21-108 18 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   3


      5.1.1. If the item cannot be found, after an extensive search, notify 19 MXO/MOC and
      then follow the instructions for Lost Tools I.A.W. AFI 21-101 AMC_ Sup 1.
6. Depot/Contract field teams.
   6.1. When a Depot team, factory representative or contract field team performs
   maintenance/modifications within the Airfield, they will follow this instruction for tool
   accountability. If the contractor or team has not made provisions for tool control and
   accountability, they will follow the representing squadrons program. If they cannot follow
   the squadrons program then they must coordinate with 19 MXG/QA to develop a program.
   The program guidelines will be put in letter form and co-signed by the team leader/supervisor
   and QA. The team leader/supervisor and Quality Assurance Representative (QAR) will
   maintain a copy of the letter for the duration of the team's stay.
