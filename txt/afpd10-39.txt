SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision clarifies roles and responsibilities for ensuring the safeguarding of BSAT and
establishes the requirement for an Air Force BPRP. This revision adds responsibilities specific
to Air Force Major Commands (MAJCOMs) that oversee installations/facilities registered to
 2                                                               AFPD10-39 19 AUGUST 2011


possess BSAT, as well as responsibilities specific to commanders of installations that have tenant
units registered to possess BSAT; and it omits operational-level guidance already detailed in
DoDI 5210.89_AFI 10-3901, Minimum Security Standards for Safeguarding Biological Select
Agents and Toxins.
1. Background. The anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001 spurred several U.S. Government policy
initiatives to ensure BSAT are adequately restricted, protected, and tracked. The USA
PATRIOT Act of 2001 places restrictions on the possession of select agents and provides
criminal penalties for possession of such agents that cannot be justified for specified peaceful
purposes. Subsequent entries in federal regulations added additional restrictions. The Secretary
of Defense, through the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)), released policy
(DoDD 5210.88 and DoD Instruction (DoDI)) 5210.89, Minimum Security Standards for
Safeguarding Biological Select Agents and Toxins) implementing the requirements of the laws
discussed above, along with additional safeguards specifically for DoD. On 2 July 2010, the
President issued Executive Order 13546, “Optimizing the Security of Biological Select Agents
and Toxins,” which highlights the importance of BSAT research to national security and further
emphasizes the unique security concerns associated with BSAT. These documents establish
significant requirements for access control, physical security, and personnel reliability.
2. Policy. It is Air Force policy that:
     2.1. The Air Force shall be in full compliance with the provisions of the Biological Weapons
     Convention, to which the United States is a party.
     2.2. All Air Force facilities using, possessing, transferring, or receiving BSAT, and Air
     Force contracted facilities furnished with DoD-supplied BSAT, shall be registered as
     described in DoDD 5210.88, in accordance with Title 42, Code of Federal Regulations
     (CFR), Part 73, Select Agents and Toxins, current edition; Title 7, CFR, Part 331, Possession,
     Use, and Transfer of Select Agents and Toxins, current edition; and Title 9, CFR, Part 121,
     Possession, Use and Transfer of Select Agents and Toxins, current edition. This policy does
     not apply to facilities meeting the exemption provisions of 42 CFR Part 73 §73.6; 7 CFR Part
     331 §331.4; and 9 CFR Part 121 §121.4.
     2.3. All BSAT shall be properly safeguarded against loss, theft, diversion, and unauthorized
     access or use in accordance with the minimum standards contained in the Air Force
     supplement to DoDI 5210.89 (DoDI 5210.89_AFI 10-3901).
     2.4. Individuals who have a legitimate need to handle or use BSAT, or whose duties afford
     access to storage and work areas, storage containers, and equipment containing BSAT, shall
     be screened initially for suitability and reliability in accordance with DoDI 5210.89_AFI 10-
     3901. All personnel assigned to Air Force BSAT duties will be certified in the BPRP.
     Personnel will undergo a Single-Scope Background Investigation prior to enrollment in the
     BPRP, and will be evaluated on a continuing basis as described in DoDI 5210.89_AFI 10-
     3901.
     2.5. A restricted person, as defined in 42 CFR Part 73 §73.8 and the Denial, Revocation, and
     Suspension of Registration section of 7 CFR Part 331, may not have access to BSAT.
     2.6. Biosafety Level (BSL) 2, 3, and 4 facilities and laboratories registered by the United
     States Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and
     Prevention (HHS/CDC) and/or the United States Department of Agriculture/Animal and

Terms
Biological Agent— Living microorganism or their byproduct (toxins), when natural or modified,
including viruses or infectious pathogens derived from them that causes disease or death in
humans, plants, or animals. Biological agents may exist as purified and concentrated cultures
but may also be present in a variety of materials such as body fluids, tissues, soil samples, etc.
Biological Select Agents and Toxins— Biological agents and toxins selected by the CDC and
APHIS that present a high bioterrorism risk to national security and have the greatest potential
for adverse public health impact with mass casualties of humans and/or animals or that pose a
severe threat to plant health or to plant products. The lists of select agents and toxins, overlap
select agents and toxins, and biological agents and toxins, are reviewed and updated by the CDC
and APHIS and are listed in 42 CFR Part 73, 7 CFR Part 331, and 9 CFR Part 121. These agents
are also known as high-consequence livestock pathogens and toxins, non-overlap agents and
toxins, and listed plant pathogens.
Biosafety Levels (BSL)— Specific combinations of work practices, safety equipment, and
facilities designed to minimize the exposure of workers and the environment to infectious agents.
There are four biosafety levels.
Level 1— Practices, safety equipment, and facility design and construction are appropriate for
undergraduate and secondary educational training and teaching laboratories, and for other
laboratories in which work is done with defined and characterized strains of viable
microorganisms not known to consistently cause disease in healthy humans.
Level 2— Practices, safety equipment, and facility design and construction are applicable to
clinical, diagnostic, teaching, and other laboratories in which work is done with the broad
spectrum of indigenous moderate-risk agents that are present in the community and associated
with human disease of varying severity.
Level 3— Practices, safety equipment, and facility design and construction are applicable to
clinical, diagnostic, teaching, research, or production facilities in which work is done with
indigenous or exotic agents with a potential for respiratory transmission, and which may cause
serious and potential lethal infection.
 8                                                                   AFPD10-39 19 AUGUST 2011


Level 4— Practices, safety equipment, and facility design and construction are applicable for
work with dangerous and exotic agents that pose a high individual risk or life-threatening
disease, which may be transmitted via the aerosol route and for which there is no available
vaccine or therapy.
Controlled Area— An area to which entry is subject to special restrictions or control for
security reasons, or to safeguard property or material. NOTE: For the purposes of the Air Force
Biological Security Program, the term “controlled area” meets the standards of what USD(I)
guidance refers to as a “restricted area.”
Toxins— Toxins are poisonous compounds produced by a living organism. Unlike organisms,
toxins cannot replicate.
Vulnerability Assessment— An evaluation (assessment) to determine the vulnerability to a
terrorist attack against an installation, unit, exercise, port, ship, residence, facility, or other site.
It identifies areas of improvement to withstand, mitigate, or deter acts of violence or terrorism.
The process used to determine the susceptibility to attack from the full range of threats to the
security of personnel, materiel, and facilities, which provides a basis for determining
antiterrorism measures that can protect personnel and assets from terrorist attacks.
