   8.1. BE will conduct routine or special surveys and schedule shielding surveys. The RSO or
   delegate will conduct other surveys at the request of using organizations.
   8.2. Surveys will be reported through the OEHWG.
   8.3. Types of surveys are:
      8.3.1. Probe surveys using portable survey meters to detect alpha, beta, gamma,
      neutrons, or x-ray radiation.
      8.3.2. Swipe sample surveys which use filter paper to smear suspected outer
      contaminated areas.
      8.3.3. Evaluation of procedures, materials, and documentation.
9. Leak Testing Sealed Sources
   9.1. Each sealed source acquired from another person or organization, (containing by-
   product material or any other radioactive material with a half-life greater than 30 days and in
   any form other than gas) will be tested for contamination and leakage before use.
   9.2. In the absence of a certificate from a transfer indicating that a test had been made within
   six months prior to the transfer, the sealed source will not be put in use until tested.
   9.3. The test will be capable of detecting the presence of 0.005 microcuries or more of
   radioactive material on the test sample.
   9.4. Unless otherwise specified, the permittee is responsible for swipe sampling as specified;
   use filter paper as required to swipe the source. Forward by mail the leak test swab or filter
   paper in an enclosed envelope to USAFSAM/OEHHL 365 Third St. Bldg. 674C Wright-
   Patterson AFB OH 45433, for analysis.
   9.5. Each sealed source which the permittee uses (containing by-product material or any
   other radio-active material with a half-life greater than 30 days and in any form other than
   gas) will be tested for leakage and contamination at intervals specified in the permit.
   9.6. If the above tests reveal the presence of 0.005 microcuries or more of removable
   contamination, the permittee will immediately notify Base RSO and withdraw the sealed
   source from use and arrange for it to be decontaminated and repaired or disposed of in
   accordance with the waste disposal procedures.
10. Emergency Procedures
   10.1. Emergencies include any unusual occurrences that result in contamination of facilities
   or environment, or that may result in the exposure of personnel to hazardous levels of
   ionizing or non-ionizing radiation. BE must be notified immediately of all these
   emergencies.
   10.2. RSO, BE, or delegate will be directly involved with all investigations and reporting of
   accidents and incidents involving radioactive materials. The Occupational Medicine
   Consultant will be informed of all ongoing investigations. The RSO will report the findings
   to the OHWG. All reporting and investigations will be per the applicable sections of AFI 91-
   202, The U.S. Mishap Prevention Program; AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports;
   AFI 40-201; and TO 00-110N-3. Reporting under AFI 91-204 does not negate the reporting
   requirements of AFI 40-201 and the NRC.
 10                                                          36WGI48-106 1 OCTOBER 2012


   10.3. Treat any RAM spill as a major spill until monitoring can be accomplished to
   determine the actual intensity of the radiation exposure.
   10.4. Fire fighting procedures are as follows:
      10.4.1. The fighting of fires, which may occur in buildings, must be accomplished in
      such a manner that exposure of personnel to radiation is held to a minimum and the
      spread of radioactive contamination is avoided.
      10.4.2. As a general rule, when using fire hoses, water fog is preferable to solid stream
      application to avoid excessive runoff of water that may spread contamination.
      10.4.3. If a fire breaks out, sound the evacuation alarm, call 911, and notify BE of its
      location. If no immediate radiation hazard exists and the potential for sustaining injuries
      is remote, combat the fire using the nearest fire extinguisher, sand, or water. If there is
      sufficient time, personnel who are using isotopes and are not in the fire area should
      quickly place their isotopes into storage containers, transport containers from the area,
      then close the windows and doors, and shut off the ventilation system before leaving the
      area.
      10.4.4. Firefighters must wear protective clothing and respiratory equipment even though
      there is no evidence of immediate radiation danger. If possible, fire fighting should be
      conducted from the upwind side of the blaze. If time allows, firefighters will be issued
      TLDs and personal electronic dosimeters by BE personnel.
   10.5. Accidental peacetime exposure to radioactive material (non-wartime or terrorist
   attack):
      10.5.1. Remain calm. Accidental exposure to medically significant radiation is not
      possible with the items present on AAFB.
      10.5.2. Notify BE as soon as possible by calling BE Tech on-call cell phone 688-1165.
      10.5.3. A person known or suspected to have ingested or inhaled of any quantity of
      radioactive material will be transported immediately for medical evaluation. The
      individual will not present a radiation hazard to emergency response personnel.
      10.5.4. A person with radioactive particulate contamination on their clothing should
      slowly remove the affected garment (to limit producing airborne dust). Place the garment
      in any expedient container, preferably a plastic bag if available. If particulate
      contamination is suspected on bare skin, thoroughly rinse the area with water. Additional
      decontamination may be conducted by Fire Department or CE Readiness personnel, if
      warranted.
11. Laser Safety Procedures
   11.1. Any new process involving lasers requires adequate safe operating procedures. BE
   will review the proposed process and inspect the operation area for hazards (such as
   reflecting surfaces) and required controls (such as laser safety goggles). All work with lasers
   will be done in strict accordance with AFOSHSTD 48-139. The commander, 36th Medical
   Group will have final approval authority for laser operations.
   11.2. The using organization, when requesting approval of laser operations will:

   Emitters will be assigned a risk assessment rating (low, medium, or high) based on its hazard
   potential as defined by AFOSHSTD 48-9, Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR) Safety
   Program. The frequency of RF emitter surveys outside occupied work areas will be based on
   the risk assessment rating and will be at the discretion of the surveyor/industrial hygienist.
   The three main parts of the risk assessment include recognition, evaluation, and controls for
   RF emitters. Chapter 3 of AFOSHSTD 48-9 explains in detail the requirements of the risk
   assessments. Attachment 4 of AFOSHSTD 48-9 provides guidelines for performing RF
   power density measurements.
      12.1.1. AF Form 2759, Radio Frequency Radiation Emitter Survey, will be completed at
      the time of the survey.
      12.1.2. A copy of the completed AF Form 2759 will be provided to 36 WG/SEG for
      electro-explosives hazard evaluations.       The surveyor will obtain the following
      information from the supervisor of an area in which RF emitters are used:
          12.1.2.1. Location and nomenclature.
          12.1.2.2. Organization responsible for its use.

                                            TERMS

A2.1. ALARA. – As Low As Reasonable Achievable concept. ALARA is defined as that set of
management and administrative actions taken to reduce personnel ionizing radiation exposure to
as low a level as possible consistent with existing technology, costs, and operational
requirements.
A2.2. Controlled Area. – An area outside of a restricted area but inside the site boundary,
access to which can be limited by the licensee for any reason.
Controlled area – Any area where radioisotopes are used or stored and to which access is limited
to reduce exposure of individuals to radiation. In the case of non-ionizing radiation, controlled
areas are those that may be occupied by personnel who accept potential exposure as concomitant
of employment or duties; by individuals who knowingly enter areas where levels above the
permissible exposure limits (PEL), defined in AFOSHSTD 48-9, Radio Frequency Radiation
(RFR) Safety Program, are to be expected; and by personnel passing through such areas.
A2.3. Electromagnetic radiation. - A term used to mean non-ionizing radiation in the
frequency range from about 10 kilohertz (kHz) to 300 gigahertz (GHz).
A2.4. Microcuries. – One-millionth of a curie. A curie is a term designating a quantity of
radioactive material present; 1 curie is the amount of radioactive material required to produce 37
billion disintegrations per second. Because radioisotopes decay at different rates, the amount of
a specific radioactive element that represents a curie is different for each element.
A2.5. Millirem. – One-thousandth of roentgen equivalent man (rem). A rem is a unit of
absorbed radiation by human beings. Radiation standards are normally expressed in millirem
(mrem) or rem per unit of time.
A2.6. Probe surveys. – Measurements using portable survey meter to detect alpha, beta,
gamma, neutrons, or x-ray radiation.
A2.7. Radiation dosimeter program. – A program described in AFI 48-125, The US Air Force
Personnel Dosimetry Program, for routinely monitoring personnel who work with radiation
producing devices and who may receive radiation doses in excess of 10% of the applicable
radiation standard.
A2.8. RAM. – Radioactive material.
A2.9. Restricted Area. – An area, access to which is limited by the licensee for the purpose of
protecting individuals against undue risks from exposure to radiation and radioactive materials.
Thermoluminescent badges and self-reading pocket dosimeters will be worn in ionizing radiation
areas.
A2.10. Self-reading Pocket Dosimeter. – A radiation detection device normally worn by an
individual and designed to detect and quantitatively measure x-ray and gamma radiation. These
dosimeters are not as accurate as thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD), but they can be read by
the wearer and give a good indication of received radiation dose. If issued, they are to be worn
concurrently with TLDs.
36WGI48-106 1 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 17


A2.11. Swipe samples. – Samples using filter paper to detect removable radioactive material.
Filter paper is smeared across suspected contaminated areas.
A2.12. TLD (Thermoluminescent Dosimeter). – A radiation detection device normally worn
by an individual and designed to detect and quantitatively measure beta, gamma, x-ray, and, if
required, neutron radiation. These dosimeters are read by the USAF Center for Radiation
Dosimetry (formerly Armstrong Lab and Det 1, HSC/OEBD) at Brooks AFB, TX.
