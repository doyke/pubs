This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 63-
101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle Management, 17 April 2009. This supplement
describes AFMC’s procedures for use in conjunction with the basic AFI. This supplement
applies to all AFMC organizations and staff with responsibilities in acquisition, modification,
and modernization, installation support, logistics and sustainment, safety, security and force
protection and budget programming/advocacy for nuclear weapons, trainers, components, or

identifies the Headquarters AFMC organizations responsible for Mission Assignments, Transfer
Support Plans, and Industry and Government business partners, establishes a command
requirement for a “Sustainment Roadmap”, and guidance on information to be provided in
sustainment plans. This supplement also implements command policy for AFMC organizations
that manage or provide oversight for sustainment/support equipment. It does not apply to the Air
Force Reserve Command or Air National Guard units. To ensure standardization, any AFMC
organization supplementing this instruction must send the implementing publication to HQ
AFMC/A8X for review and coordination before publishing. Submit recommendations for
improvements and/or changes to this AFMC Supplement in writing to HQ AFMC/A8/9, 4375
