This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-5, Civilian Personnel
Resource Management. It outlines the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) policy for
managing overhire positions. It articulates the AFMC/CC expectation that Centers manage their
civilian overhire program responsibly within their existing resources. Centers are responsible for
coding positions in the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS) in order to track
hiring strategies, as part of their overall Civilian Employment Plan (CEP) and work-year
execution overhire funding. Civilian overhires are approved for advance hiring, the transferof
work pending the establishment of the authorizations and to accomplish short-term or
intermediate-term non-recurring work (e.g., projects). Requirments should be included in the
Civiliam Employment Plan (CEP) for the next fiscal year (FY). This publication does not apply
to the Air National Guard (ANG) and the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and their units.
Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command. The
authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier
(“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement. See AFI 33-260,
Publications and Forms Management, Table 1.1 for a description of authorities associated with
the Tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate
Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication OPR for non-tiered compliance
items. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air
Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS).

1. Definitions.
     1.1. Civilian Overhire. A civilian overhire is defined as a position not on a firm
     authorization. Overhires are generally used to satisfy short-term or seasonal workload
     requirements or to meet vital mission requirements. Overhire positions are utilized in the
     following ways:
        1.1.1. Seasonal Workload. Overhires may perform seasonal workload exceeding
        allocated manpower capabilities. Requests for workloads that are programmable should
        be processed as far in advance as possible. (Example: Lifeguards or Snow removal.)
        1.1.2. Emergency Workload. Overhires may be used to perform emergency
        requirements, which are beyond the control of the local commander/director. (Examples:
        fire damage, storm damage, and natural disasters.) Peak workload requirements that were
        accounted for during development of manpower standards for a given functional area are
        not considered as emergency workload.
        1.1.3. Student Program Appointments. Overhire positions may be used for
        appointments to the Student Temporary Employment Program (STEP) or the Student
        Career Experience Program (SCEP).
        1.1.4. Special Workforce Development. Overhire positions may be used for AF-
        directed work or Command initiatives to develop the workforce. Positions covered by
        this paragraph will be defined by HQ AFMC/A1, who will provide appropriate coding
        requirements.
        1.1.5. Short-Term Mission Requirement. Overhire positions may be used to perform
        temporary duties as directed and approved by management. This would include surge
        workload or special project/initiative that will take place for a limited time.
        1.1.6. Future Workforce Development. Overhire positions may be used to develop
        people in anticipation of future requirements through special programs for trainees,
        interns, etc. These positions would become permanent when mission and funding become
        available for the future requirement.
        1.1.7. Local Installation. Overhire positions may be used for Permanent Employees. For
        example, overhire positions may be used for employees who become surplus to their unit
        when authorizations within the unit are decreased due to mission changes, organizational
        changes or unplanned manpower end strength reductions. This is a temporary solution,
        and it is important to place these employees on authorized positions as soon as possible.
        1.1.8. Reimbursables. Overhire positions may be funded services and agencies outside
        of your organization. Reimbursable Overhires are temporary or term manpower
        requirements over and above the Reimbursable Budget Authority (RBA) manpower
        authorizations allocated to a specific unit. Reimbursable Overhires are approved for
        workload required by and agreed to by a customer. The length of the program being
        supported normally dictates the length of requirement for these positions.
        1.1.9. Mission Continuity. Overhire positions may be used to perform key functions
        that should not be left vacant if at all possible. When a known Permanent Change of
        Station (PCS) or retirement date exists, managers should establish an overhire to start the
        hiring process to minimize disruption to the mission caused by a vacancy. If an employee
AFMCI36-603 13 AUGUST 2014                                                                       3


       deploys, another employee may be put on as an overhire to perform the duties as a back
       fill.
       1.1.10. Advance Hiring. Overhire positions may be used for Directed New Mission or
       Early Start to Mission Already Programmed. These programs will require documentation
       that reflects AFMC or AF-level approval. Overhires are intended to facilitate this process
       through advanced recruitment for a projected vacancy. These overhire approvals should
       be accompanied by transition plans which will move the individual to a permanent
       authorization in the near future.
   1.2. Lapse Rate. The difference in encumbered Unit Manning Document (UMD) positions
   as compared to vacant UMD positions creates lapse rate that forms the basis for overhire
   funding.
   1.3. Employee Employment Status. Overhire positions may be used for Civilian
   Temporary, Term, Permanent, and Career Conditional appointments which define a civilian
   employee's employment status. These appointments can be made against permanent UMD
   authorizations or overhire positions. Term and Temporary appointments should not be
   confused with time-limited overhire positions.
2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. Centers will:
       2.1.1. Manage their respective overhire programs through their operating boards (e.g.,
       Civilian Employment and Cost Management Committee (CECMC)), to ensure oversight
       of manpower authorizations and civilian pay budget execution. Prioritize existing
       workload first to accommodate the higher headquarters-directed work by realigning
       resources to satisfy the requirement prior to any overhire HQ funding request.
       2.1.2. As part of the Center Board Process, utilize request format (Atch 1) and include
       the following information:
           2.1.2.1. Justification for the overhire request with a description of the position.
           2.1.2.2. Beginning and ending date for the overhire position(s).
           2.1.2.3. Approximate cost for the overhire. To estimate the cost of the overhire, the
           organization must know the title, series and grade of the position.
           2.1.2.4. If the requirement for the position is downward directed from higher
           headquarters and is unfunded.
           2.1.2.5. Identify the requirement as a disconnect in the next Program Objective
           Memorandum (POM) cycle.
       2.1.3. Prior to requesting overhire position funding from HQ AFMC, exhaust all internal
       alternatives to satisfy the workload within base discretionary funding.
       2.1.4. Submit Overhire requirements for which Centers are requesting HQ AFMC
       funding to HQ AFMC/A1. Centers provide submissions with an electronic staff summary
       and request format Atch 1.
       2.1.5. Code all local and HQ approved overhires in DCPDS using the 10-character
       Manpower Position Control Number (MPCN) field, in accordance with Table 1, DCPDS
 4                                                                                        AFMCI36-603 13 AUGUST 2014

        2.2. Center DPs will:
           2.2.1. Provide direction and oversight to the functional overhire process through their
           operating boards (e.g., CECMC). AFPD 36-5, Civilian Personnel Resource Management,
           allows that overhire programs may be an essential tool to successfully manage civilian
           pay budgets and work-year execution goals.
           2.2.2. Establish procedures to approve and manage overhire positions consistent with
           direction provided by headquarters.
           2.2.3. Ensure there is a valid requirement for the overhire position.
           2.2.4. Verify workloads are valid and not already included in the work center's
           authorized manning levels via appropriate servicing Manpower and Organization office.
           2.2.5. Requesting Organization will complete Overhire request format with thorough
           justification and coordination (Atch 1).
        2.3. Center Senior Functional (CSF) will advocate for the functional requirement and assist
        in the justification for the overhire requirement.
        2.4. HQ AFMC/A1:
AFMCI36-603 13 AUGUST 2014                                                               5


     2.4.1. Chairs the AFMC CECMC, which is responsible for providing the AFMC
     Commander with a Command-wide perspective on the AFMC Civilian Workforce
     program.
     2.4.2. Serves as the point of entry for Center overhire requests for HQ AFMC funding,
     only after the Center has exhausted all internally available funding options. Overhire
     Request format is attached. (Atch 1).
     2.4.3. Coordinates HQ AFMC Functional review of Center overhire requests, to include
     A8/9 and Financial Management (FM).
     2.4.4. As the AFMC CECMC formulates an approval/disapproval memo
     recommendation on the Center overhire request and presents it to the AFMC Group for
     decision.
     2.4.5. Signs and sends requesting Center an approval/disapproval memo per AFMC
     Group of Council direction.
  2.5. The Overhire program must run efficiently and effectively to support AFMC workload
  when other means are not available. Using this resource when and where it is absolutely
  necessary will provide AFMC with necessary mission capability.
