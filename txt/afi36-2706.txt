MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION C
               MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs

FROM: AF/A1
1040 Air Force Pentagon
Washington, D.C. 20330-1040

SUBJECT: Air Force Policy Guidance Memorandum to AFI 36-2706, Equal Opportunity
Program, Military and Civilian.

               By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Air Force Guidance
Memorandum (GM) immediately changes AFI 36-2706, Equal Opportunity Program: Military
and Civilian. Compliance with this memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are
inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance
with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

        Under 10 United States Code (USC) Section 1561, commanders are required to
immediately conduct a Commander-Directed Investigation (CDI) when an employee files a
complaint of discrimination based on sexual harassment. Historically, the Air Force has
interpreted this to apply to complaints by its Military members and left the decision to seek a
CDI in Civilian complaints to the Complainant. After legal review, we have concluded that this
is inconsistent with the intent of 1561 and that this requirement must be applied equally to both
Military members and Civilian employees. This Guidance modifies sections 1.19.23. and
4.5.1.7. of AFI 36-2706.

    The guidance in this Memorandum becomes void after 180 days have elapsed from the date
of this Memorandum, or upon incorporation by interim change to, or a rewrite of AFI 36-2706,
Equal Opportunity Program: Military and Civilian, whichever is earlier.

This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-27, Equal Opportunity, 22
May 2009. It prohibits unlawful discrimination and harassment, and reprisal. It establishes the

civilian Air Force (AF) personnel, including Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Units. This
publication applies to Air National Guard (ANG) personnel in federal active duty status under
Title 10, U.S. Code. This instruction covers complaints of unlawful discrimination filed by
appropriated-fund, non-appropriated-fund, applicants for employment, and former employees of
the Air Force. It also applies to employees from federal agencies receiving Air Force support
under a servicing agreement who allege unlawful discrimination in matters controlled by the Air
Force. It does not apply to contract employees (unless authorized by law or regulation to file a
federal agency complaint), employees or applicants of the Army and Air Force Exchange

Code.

For purpose of this instruction, the term Installation or Center Equal Opportunity (EO) Director
refers to the individual responsible to the senior AF Commander or Director in charge of the
mission and accountable for the overall organization EO and Human Relations climate. With

Commission) that prohibit unlawful discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national
origin, age (40 or older), disability, genetic information, or reprisal for participating in the EEO
process or opposing discriminatory practices. Although AF policy prohibits unlawful
discrimination based on sexual orientation for civilians, this instruction does not apply to such

climate assessments and human relations education also apply to civilian personnel.

                 AIR FORCE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY (EO) PROGRAM

Section 1A—Equal Opportunity (EO) Policies

1.1. Zero Tolerance for Unlawful Discrimination or Harassment. It is the policy of the
United States Government, the Department of Defense, and the Air Force, not to condone or
tolerate unlawful discrimination, to include sexual harassment, of any kind. This Zero Tolerance
policy ensures that once unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment is alleged, immediate and
appropriate action will be taken to investigate/resolve the allegations and ensure any proven
unlawful behavior stops. Further, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against any
Airman, military or civilian, who engages in unlawful discriminatory practices. Air Force EO
policy compliance is a function of leadership.
   1.1.1. It is against Air Force policy for any Airman, military or civilian, to unlawfully
   discriminate against, harass, intimidate or threaten another Airman on the basis of race, color,
   religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, reprisal, or genetic information. Unlawful
   harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other verbal
   or physical conduct of a sexual nature particularly when submission to such conduct is made
   directly or indirectly as a term or condition of employment, and/or when submission to or
   rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for an employment decision affecting the person.
   Unlawful harassment also includes creating an intimidating, hostile working environment for
   another person on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability,
   reprisal, or genetic information. The use of disparaging terms with respect to a person’s race,
   color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information contributes to a
   hostile work environment and must not be tolerated. Commanders and supervisors should
   ensure all types of harassment are corrected as soon as possible once they are made aware.
   1.1.2. The operational language of the Air Force is English. Air Force personnel must
   maintain sufficient proficiency in English to perform their official duties. All official
   communications must be understood by those who have a need to know their content.
   Commanders may require Air Force personnel to use English only when such use is
   necessary for the performance of official duties. Accordingly, commanders, supervisors, and
   managers at all levels must not require use of English for personal communications which are
   unrelated to official duties.
   1.1.3. Although not within the purview of Title VII, the Air Force’s goal of maintaining a
   harassment-free environment for its military members and civilian employees also includes
   harassment based on sexual orientation. Leaders have a responsibility to take appropriate
   action to prevent and address harassment based on sexual orientation. Sexual Orientation
   harassment by military personnel may be punishable under UCMJ, Article 92, and should be
   addressed through command channels or the Inspector General. For civilian employees,
   additional guidance can be found in Executive Order 11478 and 13160, the U.S. Office of
   Special Counsel (OSC), http://www.osc.gov.
 12                                                            AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010


   1.1.4. Communications to EO personnel will be released to commanders and others for
   official use. EO personnel must report specific allegations of unlawful discrimination or
   sexual harassment to the chain of command upon discovery. For this reason, communication
   to EO personnel does not have any privilege of confidentiality. Exceptions: During the
   informal stage of a civilian complaint, when requested by the complainant, the complainant
   has the right to anonymity. Additionally, when acting as a neutral during any ADR process,
   military and civilian EO personnel have the confidentiality provided for in the Administrative
   Dispute Resolution Act of 1996. Comments by parties in an ADR proceeding cannot be used
   in the processing or adjudication of an EO complaint.
1.2. Prohibition of Sexual Harassment.
   1.2.1. Unlawful harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors
   or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature particularly when submission to such
   conduct is made directly or indirectly as a term or condition of employment, and/or when
   submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for an employment decision
   affecting the person. Unlawful harassment also includes creating an intimidating, hostile
   working environment (See Attachment 1 for full definition).
   1.2.2. Prevention is the best tool to eliminate sexual harassment in the workplace.
   Commanders and supervisors at every level should take steps to prevent sexual harassment
   from occurring; clearly communicate to employees that sexual harassment will not be
   tolerated; provide sexual harassment training to employees; establish or insure an effective
   complaint or grievance process is available; take immediate action to investigate and resolve
   all employee harassment complaints; and take appropriate action when a complaint is
   confirmed or substantiated.

Section 1B—Purpose of the EO Program

1.3. Enhance Mission Readiness.
   1.3.1. It is the policy of the Air Force to provide equal treatment and employment
   opportunity thereby enhancing unit cohesiveness, military readiness and mission
   accomplishment.
   1.3.2. As the EO program is a function of leadership and command, the Air Force shall:
      1.3.2.1. Provide sufficient resources to ensure successful and efficient operation;
      1.3.2.2. Ensure prompt, fair, and impartial processing of complaints;
      1.3.2.3. Conduct a continuing program to eradicate every form of unlawful
      discrimination;
      1.3.2.4. Communicate the policy to all Air Force personnel, military and civilian, as well
      as all applicants for Air Force positions.
      1.3.2.5. Ensure rating and reviewing officials evaluate compliance with DoD and Air
      Force directives prohibiting unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment and
      document serious and repeated deviations in performance reports/appraisals.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                         13


1.4. The EO Office.
   1.4.1. Provide Subject Matter Expert (SME). The EO Office should provide SME to
   commanders and organizations conducting ingestions related unlawful discrimination or
   sexual harassment. Organizations may include but are not limited to, Inspector General,
   Security Forces, Office of Special Investigations, Sexual Assault Response Coordinator,
   Chaplain, Staff Judge Advocate, and Personnel. The function of providing SME(s) is to
   ensure EO issues are handled correctly and efficiently.
   1.4.2. Identify, Assess and Remove EO Barriers. The EO office utilizes all available
   assessment tools (Out and About program, Unit Climate Assessments, Human Relations
   Climate Assessment, EEOC Management Directive [MD] 715, etc.) to gather information,
   identify, and assess EO barriers to assist leaders at all levels in the removal and neutralization
   of those barriers to help prevent unlawful discrimination.
   1.4.3. Provide Complaint Services. Equal Opportunity specialist/counselors will provide
   counseling for aggrieved members, assuring complaints are fairly and thoroughly addressed
   and that final actions are taken in a timely manner in accordance with the United States
   Code, the Code of Federal Regulations, EEOC directives, and Air Force policies and
   instructions in force. Equal Opportunity counselors will remain impartial and ensure
   individual members bringing allegations of unlawful discrimination or harassment
   understand the limited confidentiality in military complaints, the option to remain
   anonymous at the informal stage of civilian complaints, and the restriction on representing
   complainants. EO specialists/counselors will offer ADR at each stage of the complaint
   process for complaints that are appropriate for ADR. (See ADR in EO Complaints discussed
   in Chapter 2).
   1.4.4. Proper Reporting Requirements. The EO director will ensure proper reporting of EO
   complaints that are filed against Senior Officials, and groups of individuals alleging unlawful
   discrimination based on a class of employees.
   1.4.5. Advise Commanders. EO directors will ensure commanders/directors are aware,
   through Key Personnel and related briefings, of services offered by the EO office. EO
   specialists will make every effort to advise and assist commanders/directors with workplace
   issues to ensure quick resolution.

Section 1C—Program Objective

1.5. Eradicate Unlawful Discrimination. The EO office will assist the Commander in
conducting a continuing campaign to eradicate every form of unlawful discrimination or
harassment from the workplace. In order to promote a workplace free of unlawful discrimination
to include harassment, the EO office will take proactive steps to ensure all available efforts are in
place (e.g. human relations education, commander’s calls, enlisted/officer professional
development seminars).
1.6. Foster a Positive Human Relations Environment. The EO office will utilize the Human
Relations Climate Assessment Subcommittee (HRCAS) tool to evaluate positives and negatives
in the local environment, and Human Relations Education (HRE) to ensure, through education,
all employees and management understand the need for a positive human relations environment.

1.50. Higher Headquarters Staff Assistance Visits (SAV). SAVs are performed as a service
to the AF EO Program under the guidance and direction of AF/A1Q and AFPC/EO. SAV team
members represent the standards and values of AF EO and interact with installation/center EO
offices and other offices at the installation/center as an EO professional. The following guidance
outlines the requirements for an SAV and the expectations of performance by SAV team
members:
   1.50.1. SAV Preparation.
       1.50.1.1. AFPC/EO will establish an ―SAV Lead‖ so there is a single POC dealing with
       the EO Office and installation/center leadership.
       1.50.1.2. SAV leads will coordinate with AFPC/EO to review AF EO IT system data of
       installation/center to be visited to get a sense of ongoing issues and installation activity
       for the past two-year period and current year.
       1.50.1.3. SAV leads will contact the installation/center EO office to establish rapport and
       determine schedule arrangements (including SAV out-brief and interviews of EO office
       personnel and allied programs (e.g. JA, MPE, CPS, HRO, etc).
       1.50.1.4. SAV team members will review SAV checklist(s), including templates/samples
       for report and out-briefing and make sure you are clear on your approach, methodology,
       and interface (SAV checklist, templates/samples, etc., is located on the EO CoP).
   1.50.2. Conducting the SAV.
       1.50.2.1. Ensure each checklist item is covered in discussion, files review, and/or both as
       necessary. Document the checklist with comments ―in compliance‖ or ―not in
       compliance‖ or ―in general compliance‖ (when partial compliance is found). This IS
40                                                            AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010


     NOT an inspection, but these determinations are intended to move the EO Program
     toward integration, ensure it is in compliance for excellence in performance, and in
     preparation for future official inspections.
     1.50.2.2. Conduct a random sample of files to ascertain compliance or improvements
     (specific file review may be necessary if anomalies are discovered during the SAV
     preparation, or concerns shared by AF/A1Q or AFPC/EO).
     1.50.2.3. Conduct interviews with the following offices/personnel: EO Staff and director,
     local SJA office, local CPS, installation/center commander (director), and director of staff
     (if in chain). Interviews are conducted separately and cover items on the checklist, and
     other relevant matters as determined by the SAV team. Ensure all anomalies are
     explored with appropriate office(s). Reviews of EO office anomalies may require joint
     discussions with EO director and staff; remain open to opportunities to resolve any
     matters.
     1.50.2.4. Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) teams should interview a randomly select number
     of unit commanders and first sergeants to get a good feel for the support they receive
     from the EO office (e.g., Commander Worked Issues, UCAs, Out and Abouts, briefings,
     etc.).
     1.50.2.5. Review relevant self-inspections or other reports that concern the EO office
     operations. Look for positive activity of the EO office (e.g. outreach, programs,
     integration efforts, etc.). Solicit recommendations of EO staff for improvements. Collect
     appropriate documentation for inclusion in the report, if significant or controversial.
     1.50.2.6. Clarify any SAV team questions or concerns encountered during the visit with
     AFPC/EO. Be honest with the EO director and staff to prevent surprises.
  1.50.3. SAV Report.
     1.50.3.1. Prepare the report in draft format ―as you go‖ to assist with your out-brief and
     the eventual final report.
     1.50.3.2. Coordinate the draft report with AFPC/EO prior to the SAV out-brief. SAV
     team may provide a copy of the draft report to the EO director.
     1.50.3.3. Prepare an Executive Summary for the final report.
     1.50.3.4. Use the report template provided by AFPC/EO. Attach relevant documents as
     determined by the SAV team. Attach the checklist with written comments for each area.
     1.50.3.5. Ensure appropriate recommendations (coordinate with AFPC/EO if questions
     arise). Indicate the final report will be published within 5 business days after the SAV
     out-brief.
     1.50.3.6. Discuss SAV findings with EO director to provide opportunity to correct any
     noted deficiencies. Make an effort to balance the report with positive discoveries, or
     explain what the factors were that contributed to a negative discovery/finding. Give
     credit to efforts undertaken on the spot to correct, or in the planning stage of the EO
     office to correct.
  1.50.4. SAV Out-Brief.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                       41


       1.50.4.1. Prior to SAV out-brief, meet with EO director and go over checklist comments
       (provide a copy in advance of discussion to maximize time in discussion). Engage in a
       positive dialogue and make sure s/he is in agreement. Resolve disagreements to the extent
       practicable. Be open to suggested changes, however the SAV Team is responsible for the
       quality of the overall SAV.
       1.50.4.2. Provide Out-Brief to installation/center commander (director) at the conclusion
       of the SAV (final day of SAV). Prepare powerpoint presentation for feedback session
       with installation/center commander (director) and EO director (others at CC invitation).
       1.50.4.3. Use the out-brief SAV template provided by AFPC/EO. Presentation should
       track to the final report. Answer all questions and provide clarification on the spot. If in
       doubt, request clarification from AFPC/EO.
1.51. SAV Status Report. EO offices will provide their respective MAJCOM Strategic
Advisor and AFPC/EO a monthly status report of any open action items identified during the
SAV. The report will include base name, SAV date, open action items, status and completion
date, and POC.

                                          Chapter 2

       ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) IN EO COMPLAINTS

2.1. Use of ADR in Civilian EO Complaints.
   2.1.1. Overview. ADR processes, including mediation, facilitation, structured negotiation,
   and other collaborative problem solving techniques, or any combination thereof, often
   produce outcomes that are more efficient and effective than traditional, adversarial methods
   of dispute resolution. The Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996 (ADRA) requires
   federal agencies to adopt and promote the use of ADR in their administrative dispute
   resolution processes. The EEOC requires agencies to make reasonable efforts to settle EEO
   complaints as early as possible in, and throughout, the administrative EEO complaint process
   [29 C.F.R. Section 1614.603], and to establish and make available ADR programs for this
   purpose [29 C.F.R. Section 1614.102(b)(2)]. In accordance with AFPD 51-12, Alternative
   Dispute Resolution, and AFI 51-1201, ADR Processes in Workplace Disputes, the Air Force
   strongly encourages the voluntary use of ADR to resolve EEO complaints whenever it is
   practicable and appropriate to do so.
      2.1.1.1. Communication/Coordination. It shall be the obligation of the EO director and
      the ADR Manager at each installation to communicate with each other regarding all
      issues necessary to properly effectuate ADR in the EO Program. This shall include, but
      not be limited to, ensuring the ADR Manager is aware of all EO matters to enable the
      latter to make the determination (if delegated to do so by the SJA) whether ADR is
      appropriate, the potential use of ADR methods for resolution, and the results of any ADR
      efforts.
2.2. Use of ADR in Military EO Complaints.
   2.2.1. Overview. The EO director has an option to use ADR techniques in the Military EO
   complaint process. The EO office may use such techniques between the disputants that will
   lead to the early resolution of informal and formal cases. Facilitation is the ADR technique
   that will be used to resolve Military EO complaints. The EO office will offer services of an
   ADR specialist who has been trained in the use of facilitation/mediation and interest-based
   negotiation to serve as a facilitator whenever the disputants voluntarily agree to the use of
   ADR. For the purposes of this section, all provisions of section 2.2 shall apply to the
   Military EO process unless otherwise specified below.
   2.2.2. The EO office will annotate facilitations regarding unlawful discrimination or sexual
   harassment on AF Form 1587-1, Military Equal Opportunity Formal Complaint Summary for
   informal complaints and AF Form 1587 for formal complaints.
   2.2.3. When appropriate, the EO office will attach a copy of the facilitation agreement, if
   any, to the AF Form 1587-1 or AF Form 1587, as appropriate and file in the unit continuity
   folder.
   2.2.4. The EO office will document all other non-EO related military and civilian ADR
   services accomplished by the EO office on the AF Form 1271.
   2.2.5. All complaints that are appropriate for ADR are eligible for the voluntary use of
   facilitation and/or structured negotiation using interest-based negotiation techniques.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                      45


  2.2.6. The EO specialist will advise the complainant at the initial interview of the benefits
  and availability of facilitation and/or structured negotiation using interest-based negotiation
  techniques to resolve the complaint.
  2.2.7. The EO director shall communicate with the ADR Manager who shall determine, after
  consultation with the servicing legal office, if facilitation and/or structured negotiation is
  appropriate, pursuant to this Instruction and AFPD 51-12, Alternative Dispute Resolution,
  and AFI 51-1201, Alternative Dispute Resolution Processes in Workplace Disputes. If
  determined appropriate, the EO specialist shall offer ADR to the complainant and, if
  accepted, to the appropriate management official or alleged offender. If ADR is agreed to,
  the ADR Manager will appoint a trained, qualified ADR specialist to act as facilitator.
  2.2.8. Within 15 duty days of being appointed, the facilitator will arrange to conduct the
  facilitation. This period may be extended an additional 15 duty days with consent of the
  parties and the approval of the ADR Manager.
  2.2.9. The facilitator is authorized to set the date, time and place of the facilitation and to
  determine the ground rules for conducting the proceeding. Ground rules include start and
  end times, timing and length of breaks, dress preferences (uniform or civilian clothing), and
  similar procedural issues unrelated to the complaint itself.
  2.2.10. The facilitator will inform each party's chain of command of the outcome of the
  facilitation within three duty days of its completion.
  2.2.11. The facilitator shall explain to the disputants that facilitation is an alternative
  informal process to resolve concerns or allegations of unlawful discrimination and sexual
  harassment (workplace-related only), and ensure the disputants understand the benefits of

   their supervisor, first sergeant or commander) to informally resolve unlawful discrimination
   and sexual harassment complaints.
   3.10.2. Potential complainants may orally address or prepare written correspondence to the
   alleged offender advising him or her of the perceived inappropriate behavior with a clear
   message that continuation of that behavior may result in formal complaint action.

   complaint. The EO specialist will annotate the complainant’s decision in Block 17. If the
   complainant determines his/her allegation(s) has not been resolved and does not elect to file a
   formal complaint, annotate the justification in Block 16 and brief the complainant on the

  and to the complainant’s commander for review. The complaint clarification report must
  contain information sufficient to enable the commander to take action to eliminate unlawful
  discrimination or sexual harassment. The commander must provide the EO office a summary

  clarification is considered substantiated.
  3.20.10. If the complaint clarification does not substantiate the allegations of unlawful

   calendar days after the complainant signs Block 29. In all cases the EO office must follow-
   up to ensure reprisal has not occurred. In substantiated cases, the EO office will conduct

the alleged offender(s) that they are the subject(s) of a formal military EO complaint, the general
nature (e.g., racial discrimination, sexual harassment) of the allegations made against them, and

make every effort to protect the complainant’s identity or demographics and refrain from
providing specific details contained on the AF Form 1587 to the alleged offender. The
commander must also caution the alleged offender against taking reprisal or other retaliatory
actions against the complainant or witnesses if he/she suspects their identity. The commander
must caution the alleged offender not to discuss the case with others during the clarification
process. The commander will inform the alleged offender the EO office will conduct impartial
interviews of potential witnesses and advise the alleged offender that he or she may provide the

   qualified right to union representation during investigatory interviews. If an employee
   requests union representation (Weingarten Rights), stop the interview and consult with the
   SJA and installation labor management relation official.

  3.22.3. If, after coordination with the servicing SJA, the EO office determines that it is
  permissible to conduct an interview, the EO office informs the alleged offender that his or
  her cooperation in the interview process is strictly voluntary and he or she is free to leave at
  any time. If the individual declines to answer questions, asks to have a legal counsel or
  union representative present, or requests to leave at any time, the EO office terminates the
  interview and allows the individual to leave. The EO office will document on AF Form
  1587, Block 20, and continue with complaint clarification.
  3.22.4. The EO office will use AF Form 1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness/Complainant,
  when advising an alleged offender of his/her rights under Article 31.
  3.22.5. If after coordination with the SJA, the EO office suspects the alleged military
  offender has committed an offense under the UCMJ, the EO office will advise the alleged

   ―I am (grade and name as applicable). I am conducting a military EO Formal Complaint
   Clarification IAW AFI 36-2706, into the alleged offense(s) of which you are suspected:
   [detail offense(s) as advised by the SJA]. I advise you that under Article 31 of the UCMJ,
   you have the right to remain silent, that is, say nothing at all. Any statement you make, oral
   or written, may be used as evidence against you in a trial by court-martial or in other
   judicial or administrative proceedings. You have the right to consult a lawyer and to have a
   lawyer present during this interview. You have the right to military counsel free of charge.
   In addition to military counsel, you are entitled to a civilian lawyer of your choosing, at
   your own expense. You may request a lawyer at any time during this interview. If you
   decide to answer questions, you may stop the questioning at any time.‖

    Do you wish to exercise your right to remain silent? (If the member wishes to remain
    silent, immediately stop the interview.)
    Do you want to make a statement voluntarily and of your own free will? (If the member
    says “no,” immediately stop the interview.)
  3.22.7. If after a rights advisement, the alleged offender refuses to make a statement or
  requests legal counsel, the EO specialist must terminate the interview. The EO specialist will

   offenders or witnesses who might be so emotionally distraught during or at the conclusion of
   an interview as to pose a danger to themselves or others. The EO office must conduct a
   hand-off if the subject appears to be sufficiently disturbed by the interview. These hand-offs
   require person-to-person contact between the EO staff and the responsible commander, first
   sergeant, supervisor, or designee.
   3.23.2. The hand-off must be documented at the end of the interview in Block 20 of the AF
   Form 1587.

policies or directives, AAFES complaints, complaints of reprisal, restriction, or improper mental
health evaluations, etc (see Table 3.1).‖ However, for any complaints against senior officials,
the EO office should conduct a sufficient complaint intake to conclude the senior officials are
actually the alleged offender (i.e., that there can be a properly framed allegation the senior
official violated an established standard (law, instruction or policy) by their actions or inaction in
the complaint being reviewed). Information provided to SAF/IGS in the referral package should
include exactly what standard is alleged to have been violated by the senior official.

   calendar days until final disposition is rendered. (AFRC will provide follow-up every UTA).
   Once follow-up is complete, document the results in Block 20, AF Form 1587, and close the
   case.

   3.34.5. For cases involving senior officials, the EO office will close the case after
   conducting a sufficient complaint intake and refer to SAF/IGS. Note: SAF/IGS does not
   investigate civilian EO or Sexual Harassment allegations against senior officials, those
   matters will be worked within the appropriate EO channels. SAF/IGS does, however,
   investigate other military EO allegations against senior officials.
   3.34.6. If the complainant is not satisfied with the final disposition of the case rendered by
   another agency, advise him/her they must use the grievance/complaint channel(s) of the
   system the complaint was processed in and document the advice on AF Form 1587.
3.35. Allegations Referred to the IG from the EO Office.
   3.35.1. The EO office will conduct a clarification on allegations of unlawful discrimination

   ―FC‖ and complete the form, to include complainant’s name and demographics. Note:
   Signature of the complainant is not required.

   office will interview the complainant to clarify allegation(s) initially provided in the IG
   complaint.

   allegations in a complaint. EO should consult with IG on whether EO may proceed with
   complaint clarification and/or investigation or suspend processing until conclusion of the IG
   investigation.
      3.35.4.1. When EO completes its clarification, forward the report to the SJA for legal
      sufficiency review and then to the IG. The EO office will annotate any delays in the
      military EO complaint processing timelines in Block 20, AF Form 1587.
      3.35.4.2. EO and IG may agree for IG to investigate the EO allegations. If so, once the
      IG investigation is completed, the IG must forward a summary of action(s) taken

AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                    67


   complaints involving O-6/O-6 selects and civilian equivalents during the initial interview.
   (Note: AFRC EO specialists will consult MAJCOM and Numbered Air Force [NAF]).
   3.36.2. Complaints Involving Installation/Center Commanders (Directors), and
   Installation/Center Vice Commanders. The EO office must coordinate with their respective
   MAJCOM EO Strategic Advisor prior to determining processing procedures for allegations
   against an installation/center commander (director) or installation/center vice commander (at
   AFRC bases include CCM). The MAJCOM EO Strategic Advisor, in conjunction with the

   complainants on the referral process during the initial interview. The EO office will conduct
   a sufficient complaint intake to conclude senior official involvement as an RMO who
   violated a certain standard. Senior officials should not be named as an RMO solely due to
   their position and decisions they make in the conduct of their official duties.
   3.36.4. Complaints Involving Complex Issues. The EO office must notify the MAJCOM EO
   Strategic Advisor of all complex issues. Complex issues involve those complaints/incidents
   complicated in structure and/or consisting of interconnected parts (e.g., installation
   commander/center commander (director) is the direct supervisor of alleged offender, EO
   director is named as an alleged offender/potential witness, or EO specialist is named as an
   alleged offender, etc). The MAJCOM EO Strategic Advisor, in conjunction with the
   MAJCOM/A1/IG/JA, will determine the complaint process (e.g., EO complaint clarification
   or CDI) to address the complaint. If a CDI is initiated, the MAJCOM EO Strategic Advisor
   will designate an SME from another EO office within the MAJCOM.

      authorized to render decisions on appeals that involve military EO formal complaints.
      SAF/MRB is the final review and appeal level for formal military EO complaints. EO
      offices will forward appeal packages via certified mail to AF/A1Q. AF/A1Q will ensure
      all documents are included and hand carry appeal packages to SAF/MRB. Appellants
      must submit appeals through the local EO office to the lowest level of command
      authorized to decide the appeal, e.g. to the installation commander/center commander
      (director) for appeals of installation-level cases.          Note:    The installation
      commander/center commander (director) is not disqualified from acting on an appeal by

      calendar days after notification.
      3.38.1.4. The military EO appeal process is not applicable to command action rendered
      under the UCMJ or any administrative process as a result of a substantiated complaint.
      When a commander initiates or has previously initiated action under the UCMJ or
      administrative process, that action takes precedence over any ongoing or contemplated
      appeal. In such circumstances, the applicable UCMJ or administrative appellate
      processes are the exclusive method of appeal of the UCMJ or administrative action.
      Commanders are not required to withhold command action while a military EO appeal is
      pending.
      3.38.1.5. All appeals must be in writing and will contain no more than three single-
      spaced typewritten pages. The appellant may attach supporting documents to the written
      appeal.
      3.38.1.6. The EO office will ensure the appeal authority receives a complete copy of the
      military EO case file, the written appeal, the legal review and an evaluation by the EO
      director of any new evidence presented in the appeal.
      3.38.1.7. The appeal authority will base all decisions on appeals on the military EO case
      file and any additional written matters submitted with the appeal. The appeal authority
      may sustain or overrule any finding below or remand the matter for further fact finding.
      3.38.1.8. Appeal authorities will issue written determinations briefly reporting the action
      taken on the appeal. The EO office will deliver the written appeal decision to the
      appellant and maintain a copy of the findings in the case file. If an appeal results in the
      appeal authority referring the case for further fact finding, the EO office will apprise the
      member who filed the appeal of this fact and inform them of the anticipated date of
      further action.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                       69


       3.38.1.9. Members dissatisfied with the action on their appeal have 30 calendar days
       from receipt of an appeal determination to appeal to the next higher level. (AFRC units
       have two UTAs). Appellants will submit their appeals to the next higher level through
       the local EO office. The appellate authority may waive the 30-calendar-day time limit
       for good cause based on a memorandum with sufficient justification provided by the
       member and submitted through the EO office. Note: Except in extraordinary cases, there
       is no next-level appeal when the commander of both the complainant and the offender is
       the MAJCOM/DRU commander.
       3.38.1.10. Record the results of all formal complaint appeals in the remarks section of
       the subsequent AF Form 3018. Information provided in the remarks section should
       include a brief synopsis of the complaint, the level of the appeal, and the determination of
       the appeal i.e. whether the appellate authority sustained the findings or overturned the
       findings.
       3.38.1.11. For military EO complaints that resulted in an IG investigation, the
       complainant and alleged offender may only appeal through the IG appeal process. The
       IG will inform the EO office on the final determination of the appeal.
       3.38.1.12. Complainants, offenders or alleged offenders may not use the IG system
       simply because they are dissatisfied with the outcome of a military EO case. The IG
       system is not an available channel of review unless there was an abuse or mishandling of
       the established process for appealing formal military EO complaints of discrimination.
       Note: The EO office must document all process actions and final results on AF Form
       1587.
       3.38.1.13. Active duty Air Force members who separate or retire from the Air Force

           CIVILIAN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY (EO) COMPLAINT PROCESS

Section 4A—Civilian Informal EO Complaints

4.1. Objective. The purpose of the civilian EO complaint process is to provide for the prompt,
fair and impartial processing and resolution of complaints, consistent with its legal obligations
under 29 CFR Part 1614. The objective of civilian EO counseling is to seek opportunities to
resolve issues at the lowest organizational level at the earliest possible time.
4.2. Scope of Program. An aggrieved person who believes that s/he has been discriminated
against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age (40 and older), disability,
genetic information or who believes that s/he has been subjected to sexual harassment or
retaliated against for opposing discrimination or for participating in the complaint process must
consult an EO Counselor within 45 calendar days of when s/he becomes aware of the
discriminatory action or the effective date of the personnel action. The 45-day time limit may be
extended for reasons outlined in 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.105(a)(2). Failure to contact an EO
specialist/counselor within 45 calendar days may result in dismissal of a formal complaint.
4.3. Proper Complainants. AF employees, former employees and applicants for employment
who meet the criteria outlined in 29 CFR Part 1614 may file civilian EO complaints.
   4.3.1. The aggrieved person starts the civilian EO process by contacting an EO
   specialist/counselor or an EO official and advising that s/he has been subjected to unlawful
   discrimination.
   4.3.2. Under EEOC and Air Force policy, independent contractors, contingent employees
   and ANG technicians performing military functions are generally not considered Agency
   employees for Federal Sector EEO purposes.
       4.3.2.1. In exceptional cases, however, the EEOC has determined that an individual
       classified as a contingent employee or independent contractor may be considered an
       Agency employee under the protection of Federal EEO regulations if the Agency exerts
       substantial direction and control over the contingent employee/contractor’s activities.
       4.3.2.2. The EEOC has adopted the common law agency test applied in Ma v.
       Department of Health and Human Services to determine whether an individual qualifies
       as an Agency employee. The test takes into account the following factors:
(1) the extent of the employer's right to control the means and manner of the worker's
performance; (2) the kind of occupation, with reference to whether the work usually is done
under the direction of a supervisor or is done by a specialist without supervision; (3) the skill
required in the particular occupation; (4) whether the employer or the individual furnishes the
equipment used and the place of work; (5) the length of time the individual has worked; (6) the
method of payment, whether by time or by the job; (7) the manner in which the work relationship
is terminated, i.e., by one or both parties, with or without notice and explanation; (8) whether
annual leave is afforded; (9) whether the work is an integral part of the business of the employer;
(10) whether the worker accumulates retirement benefits; (11) whether the employer pays social
security taxes; and (12) the intention of the parties. See Ma v. Department of Health and Human
 74                                                             AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010


Services, EEOC Appeal No. 01962390 (May 29, 1998) (citing Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co.
v. Darden, 503 U.S. 318, 323 (1992).
       4.3.2.3. This list of factors is generally considered non-exhaustive, and no single factor is
       dispositive. To ensure uniform application of this legal test by the Air Force, review for
       acceptance or dismissal of all complaints by contractors and other potential contingent
       employees should be conducted under the supervision of the Labor Law Field Support
       Center, 1501 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22209.
4.4. Other Military Services. When an individual alleges discrimination in a multi-service
case (e.g., Navy or Army employee alleges an Air Force management official has discriminated
against him/her or an Air Force employee alleges an Adjutant General or National Guard
member under the command and control of the Governor of a state has discriminated against
him/her), the counseling and complaint processing are conducted by the agency that will be
fiscally responsible for any settlement or judgment resulting from the allegation. Typically, that
will be the agency for whom the complainant works.

Section 4B—Informal (Pre-Complaint) Civilian EO Complaint Processing

4.5. EO Specialist/Counselor Responsibilities.
   4.5.1. Determines if a claim is appropriate for processing under 29 CFR Part 1614, Federal
   Sector Complaint Processing, and where appropriate, offers the use of ADR or any other
   informal dispute resolution procedures to resolve the claim if otherwise found to be
   appropriate for such alternative procedures. If the responsible management official involved
   is the Adjutant General of a state or is a member of the National Guard of a state in a Title 32
   status, refer the matter to the ANGRC EO Office for processing.
       4.5.1.1. Processes all claims through the informal complaint process, regardless of
       timeliness, merit, or other considerations.
       4.5.1.2. Complaints based on sexual orientation are not covered under 29 C.F.R. Section
       1614.105(a) and therefore an aggrieved person who believes s/he has been discriminated
       on the basis of sexual orientation must be referred to the CPS for counseling on
       appropriate grievance and appeal procedures. If the aggrieved person insists that s/he
       wants to file a discrimination complaint, the EO specialist/counselor should abbreviate
       the counseling and issue the notice of final interview, as discussed below. Under no
       circumstance should the EO specialist/counselor attempt to dissuade a person from filing
       a complaint or forgo the use of ADR. Subsequent dismissal of the complaint would be
       initiated per paragraph 4.12, below. The EO specialist/counselor should ascertain that the
       aggrieved individual is not alleging discrimination on the basis of sex.
       4.5.1.3. When an aggrieved person engages an EO professional for the purpose of
       obtaining information about, or articulating, a complaint, but does not elect to start the
       Informal (Pre-Complaint) process, the visit will be recorded as a Contact and documented
       as ―EO General Assistance.‖
       4.5.1.4. When an aggrieved person states their intent to file a complaint. The 30-
       calendar day informal processing period starts as of the first date the complainant
       contacts an installation EO specialist/counselor, EO director, or other official designated
       to receive discrimination complaints.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                    75


     4.5.1.5. Assigns a docket number to each informal complaint. The docket number is
     automatically assigned through the AF EO IT system and is constructed as follows:
        4.5.1.5.1. -- 2-digit servicing civilian-personnel-flight identifier,
        4.5.1.5.2. -- 2-digit servicing MAJCOM identifier,
        4.5.1.5.3. -- 2-digit current fiscal year,
        4.5.1.5.4. -- 3-digit numerical sequence starting with 001 at the beginning of each
        fiscal year. [e.g. 9D=CPS: 1S=MAJCOM ID:09=Fiscal Year:001=Numerical
        Sequence 9D1S09001=Docket Number]
     4.5.1.6. Advises aggrieved persons in writing of their rights and responsibilities. Note:
     Notice of Rights and Responsibilities USE IS MANDATORY, refer to the EO CoP for
     copy of the notice. Additionally, when the complainant claims compensatory damages,
     provide a copy of the ―Broughton Notice‖ to the complainant (Refer to the EO CoP for
     copy of notice).
     4.5.1.7. If the complainant alleges sexual harassment, advises aggrieved persons of their
     right to request a Commander Directed Investigation (CDI) under 10 U.S.C. Section
     1561, and advises the CDI would run concurrently with the EO complaint.
     4.5.1.8. Advises the aggrieved person that s/he may choose between having his/her
     complaint processed under the ADR procedure if deemed suitable and offered by the
     agency or the traditional counseling activities described in 29 C.F.R. Section
     1614.105(b)(2) and EEOC MD-110, Chapter 2. Ensure the complaint has been properly
     screened and found appropriate for ADR before offering ADR to the complainant. Note:
     The Air Force Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Program Notice use is mandatory.
     Do not decline to offer ADR solely because of the basis(es) alleged in the complaint (i.e.,
     race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, disability, genetic information or
     retaliation). [MD-110, Chapter 3, Section II [A][5]]. Participation in ADR by the
     complainant and management officials is encouraged. If ADR is not chosen because
     management is unwilling to engage in ADR, note that in the counselor’s report and
     continue the limited inquiry. If the ADR procedure is chosen, the informal complaint
     processing period shall automatically extend to 90 days. [29 C.F.R. Section 1614.105[f]
     The counseling and screening requirements of this subparagraph may be accomplished in
     accordance with AFI 51-1201, paragraph 22, for ADR screening requirements. If ADR
     fails or does not occur, the EO Counselor must complete pre-complaint investigation and
     report.
     4.5.1.9. Inform the complainant of her/his right to remain anonymous during the
     informal stage. If anonymity is elected, take appropriate measures to protect the identity
     of the complainant until a formal complaint is filed or complainant grants written
     permission to cease anonymity.
     4.5.1.10. Complete informal complaint counseling within 30 calendar days or obtains
     written approval from the complainant and the EO director, prior to the 30th day, to
     extend counseling for no more than an additional 60 calendar days. If ADR is offered
     and accepted, complete processing within 90 calendar days. In either case, if the matter
     is not resolved before the end of the authorized period, including extensions, issue the
 76                                                             AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010


       Notice of Right to File a Formal Complaint letter as described in paragraph 4.10. below.
       [29 C.F.R. Section 1614.105[d]-[f]]
4.6. Final Interview. Advise the complainant in the Notice of Right to File a Formal Complaint
letter that any formal complaint must be filed with the EO director or designee within 15
calendar days of receipt. Do not attempt in any manner to encourage or dissuade the person from
filing a complaint. This correspondence is to be sent no earlier than the 30th day and no later
than the 60th day after the issuance of the Notice of Right to File a Formal Complaint letter.
Note: The final interview concludes the informal (pre-complaint) process and there is no
requirement that the final interview be conducted face-to-face with the complainant and her/his
representative.
4.7. Counselor’s Report. Submit a narrative counselor’s report to the EO director within 5
calendar days from the date the formal complaint is filed including the items outlined in MD-
110, Chapter 2, Section VIII.

Section 4C—Civilian EO Informal Class Action Complaints

4.8. Informal Complaint Processing. An individual who wishes to file a class complaint, as
defined in 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.204(a) must seek counseling and be counseled in accordance
with 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.105. The EO director notifies AF/A1Q, AFPC/EO, LLSFC,
SAF/GCA, MAJCOM EO Strategic Advisor, the installation CPS or HRO, and SJA, in writing,
when an individual files a class complaint. The notification must include the complainant's name
(if releasable), the name of the complainant's representative, the docket number, the date of
initial contact, identification of the class, and claim(s) raised. [Note: The complainant may
move for class certification at any reasonable point in the process when it becomes apparent that
there are class implications to the claim(s) raised in an individual complaint. If the complainant
moves for class certification after completing the counseling process, according to 29 C.F.R.
Section 1614.204[b], no additional counseling is required.]
4.9. Responsibilities.
   4.9.1. When notified of a class complaint, LLFSC designates an attorney to represent the Air
   Force. The servicing SJA designates a local attorney to assist the LLFSC attorney.
   4.9.2. The EO director tries to resolve individual allegations and personal concerns of the
   complainant. Before attempting to resolve class-wide issues the EO director must coordinate
   any proposed action with LLFSC, AF/A1Q and MAJCOM EO Strategic Advisor.
   4.9.3. The EO director must coordinate the gathering and analysis of statistics with AF/A1Q
   and LLFSC before collecting the data.
   4.9.4. Before the final interview with the complainant, the EO director prepares a draft
   report for coordination with the installation SJA and CPS, MAJCOM EO Strategic Advisor,
   AF/A1Q and LLFSC. This report must include, at a minimum, the following: class claim(s),
   basis(es), definition of the proposed class, information as to potential class size, how agent’s
   claim(s) reflect claims of class (commonality and typicality), and adequacy of representation
   of the class. [29 C.F.R. Section 1614.204.]
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                       77


Section 4D—Civilian EO Formal Complaint Processing

4.10. Guidance. Formal complaints are processed in accordance with 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.
EO directors process formal complaints.
   4.10.1. A formal complaint must be filed at the installation where the alleged discrimination
   occurred, and the complainant or the attorney designated to represent the complainant must
   sign and date it. It must describe the action(s) or practice(s) that form the basis of the
   complaint that was discussed with the EO specialist/counselor during the Informal phase of
   the process.
   4.10.2. If a complainant is dissatisfied with the processing of his/her pending complaint,
   whether or not it alleges prohibited discrimination as a basis for dissatisfaction, s/he should
   be referred to the installation/center commander (director) or designee. The
   commander/director or designee promptly resolves the concerns of dissatisfaction. A written
   response should be provided to the complainant indicating the actions the agency took to
   promptly resolve the concerns and attach a copy of the letter to the complaint files
   maintained on the underlining complaint. Complaints alleging dissatisfaction are processed
   as required by 29 CFR 1614.107(a)(8). A record of the complainant’s concerns and any
   actions taken to resolve the concerns must be made a part of the complaint file. If no action is
   taken, the file must contain an explanation for not taking any action.
   4.10.3. A complainant may amend a complaint at any time before the mailing of the notice
   required by 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.108(f) at the conclusion of the investigation, to include
   claim(s) that are like or related to those raised in the complaint.
4.11. EO Director Responsibilities.
   4.11.1. Notifies the complainant and their representative (if designated) of the docket
   number and instruct them to refer to it in all future correspondence. Advises the
   complainant, in writing (within 5 days), of receipt of the formal complaint, the date that the
   complaint is considered filed, and the right to appeal to EEOC/OFO any full dismissal of the
   complaint. An identical acknowledgment, in writing, is also required for an amendment to a
   complaint. (29 C.F.R. Section 1614.106 [d] and [e])
   4.11.2. Obtains written determination by the CPS or HRO as to whether the complainant is
   eligible under MSPB jurisdiction. The EO director will coordinate with the CPS or HRO to
   determine if the individual has identical issues filed under a negotiated grievance procedure
   (NGP) or the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) appeal procedure.                Note: A
   complaint filed under the Administrative Grievance Procedure (AGP), or those NGPs that do
   not allow discrimination complaints, will not preclude the complaint from being filed under
   the Formal EEO process.
   4.11.3. Reviews the complaint file to determine that it has all required forms and supporting
   documents with signatures including the counselor’s report, verifies the employment status of
   the complainant (see 29 CFR 1614.103[c], perfects the claims, and ensures information
   covered by the Privacy Act is properly protected. Questions concerning the Privacy Act and
   its coverage are addressed to the installation Privacy Act monitor.
   4.11.4. Provides the counselor's report to the complainant within 15 calendar days of the
   date the formal complaint is filed (See 29 CFR 1614.105[c]).

   4.11.5. Submits the proposed acceptance and/or dismissal letter, including all proposed
   amendments, formal complaint (DD Form 2655), counselor’s report, and CPS or HRO
   determination of the MSPB jurisdiction to the LLFSC, or servicing legal office, within 21
   days in receipt of the formal complaint as defined in Chapter 1. Sends the request for
   additional information that includes a Notice of Proposed Dismissal [29 C.F.R. Section
   1614.107(a)(7)] by regular or certified mail, as appropriate. Provide a courtesy copy to the
   local SJA (if serviced by LLFSC) and CPS or HRO.
   4.11.6. Notifies AFCARO and AF/A1Q of any non-frivolous allegations of wrong doing
   against any senior officials, colonels (or civilian equivalents), or colonel selects, IAW AFI
   90-301, using the current AF EO IT system. On complaints filed against senior officials or
   colonels and equivalents assigned to the Secretariat or the Air Staff, notifies SAF/GCA and
   SAF/GCM.
   4.11.7. If ADR is offered and agreed to by the parties, the EO director may request a third-
   party neutral from IRD, from a roster of neutrals maintained for such purposes, or from the
   Air Force ADR Program Office website at www.adr.af.mil. Expenses for contract neutrals
   or Air Force neutrals brought in TDY may be funded locally or by the Air Force ADR
   Program Office upon request. Coordinates with IRD to de-conflict ADR proceedings from
   the investigation.
4.12. Acceptance and Dismissal.
   4.12.1. The Air Force is required to process formal EEO complaints in accordance with 29
   C.F.R. Part 1614 and EEO MD-110. The EEOC requires federal agencies to discharge
   certain responsibilities once a formal EEO complaint has been filed.
   4.12.2. The agency must acknowledge receipt of each formal EEO complaint and
   amendment to a formal EEO complaint (29 C.F.R. 1614.106[e]).
   4.12.3. The agency must process all formal complaints expeditiously and make a
   determination whether to accept, dismiss, or partially dismiss a complaint or portion of a
   complaint to allow for an investigation to be completed and the report of investigation (ROI)
   to be received by the complainant within 180 days from the date of filing (29 C.F.R.
   1614.106[e][1] and [e][2] and 1614.107[b], and EEOC MD 110, Chapter 5, Section A). The
   acceptance and dismissal (A&D) letter shall be provided to the complainant no later than 30
   days from the date of the filing.
   4.12.4. If dismissed in part or in whole, the agency must provide appeal rights indicating that
   partial dismissals may be reviewed by an EEOC Administrative Judge (AJ) if a hearing is
   requested, or appealed to the EEOC Office of Federal Operations (EEOC/OFO) when a final
   decision or final action is taken on the complaint, or if dismissed in whole, informing the
   complainant that s/he has the right to an immediate appeal to EEOC/OFO. The Agency is
   required to investigate accepted claims and provide the ROI to the complainant within 180
   calendar days of the filing of the complaint. (29 C.F.R. 1614.106 [e][1] and [e][2] and
   1614.107[b]).
   4.12.5. The Air Force adopts the following procedures to assure prompt, fair, and
   appropriate performance in accordance with the EEOC requirements. EO directors will
   ensure:
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                       79


      4.12.5.1. Acknowledgement of receipt of a formal complaint and amendment to a formal
      complaint is completed as soon as possible, but not later than 5 calendar days after
      receipt.
      4.12.5.2. EO professionals issue counselor reports for internal EO office review within 5
      calendar days of the date of receipt of the formal complaint, and final counselor reports
      are issued to the complainant not later than the 15th day after receipt of the formal
      complaint. Note: the requirement for CPS and SJA to coordinate on the counselor report
      is hereby eliminated).
      4.12.5.3. A comparison of the report is made to the formal complaint to ensure that the
      claims in the formal complaint were addressed and the EEOC criteria to Accept, Partially
      Dismiss, or Dismiss in whole were properly applied to the formal complaint (29 C.F.R.
      1614.107).
      4.12.5.4. Preparation of a standard Acceptance and/or Dismissal letter and submission of
      the formal EEO complaint, the counselor report, a written determination by the CPS as to
      whether the complaint claims and the complainant are eligible for jurisdiction by the
      Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), and whether a formal negotiated grievance or
      MSPB appeal has been filed on the same claim(s), to the servicing SJA. (Note: In some
      cases this will be the AF Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA)/Labor Law Field Support
      Center (LLFSC) and in other cases it will be the installation SJA. Check with the local
      SJA for clarification if unsure).
      4.12.5.5. Issuance of the coordinated Acceptance and/or Dismissal letter (reference
      paragraph above) to the complainant or his/her representative, if any. The authority to
      sign decision letters is vested with the installation/center commander (director) and can
      only be exercised by the EO director if delegated this authority in writing. Copies of
      written delegations must be provided to AFPC/EO and AF/A1Q for coordination with the
      supporting SJA.
      4.12.5.6. Legal reviews are for ―internal use‖ and ―management’s eyes‖ only. Legal
      reviews are documents that are covered by attorney-client privilege and are protected
      from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 and are not to be
      released without prior authorization from LLFSC.
4.13. Additional Acceptance/Dismissal Authority.
   4.13.1. AFCARO, after consultation with LLFSC, may accept a previously dismissed
   complaint upon a complainant appeal if it determines that the complaint should not have been
   dismissed.
4.14. Investigation of Formal Complaints.
   4.14.1. If the formal complaint is not dismissed in its entirety, within 30 calendar days of the
   date of receipt of the formal complaint, the EO director shall request an IRD investigation.
   (See paragraph 4.11.7. for guidance on formal complaints that are referred to an ADR
   procedure). However, in no case should an IRD investigation be requested until the Accept &
   Dismiss process is complete. The request must include the following:
      4.14.1.1. Specific claims raised and which ones are accepted.
80                                                             AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010


     4.14.1.2. Specific claims partially dismissed, including reasons and documentary
     evidence to support recommended dismissal(s).
     4.14.1.3. Complete case file and any other pertinent records.
     4.14.1.4. Name, office symbol, address (including e-mail address), phone and data fax
     number of the management representative.
  4.14.2. The EO director will obtain the fund citation for IRD investigations and EEOC
  hearings related to the complaint. Also refer to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, paragraph 10.17,
  Funding Travel Related to Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Complaints. The
  unit/organization in which the discrimination complaint arises is normally responsible for all
  costs associated with the complaint – to include agency witness travel (except AF
  employees), complainant witness travel (if witness is non-AF federal employee), depositions,
  back pay, attorney fees, compensatory damages stemming from an approved settlement
  agreement, litigation, or an administrative judge’s decision., etc. stemming from an approved
  settlement agreement or decision. Exceptions are provided for organizations supported by
  the Air Force under DoD Directive 5100.3, Support of the Headquarters of Combatant and
  Subordinate Joint Commands, November 15, 1999. Travel of Air Force personnel required
  by an AJ or other authorized official is charged to the AF participant’s unit of assignment.
  [See AFI 65-601, Volume I, paragraph 10.17.2.]
  4.14.3. Investigators determine the scope of the investigation; however, the AF’s preferred
  method is for the investigator to take on-site affidavits. The on-site affidavit method
  involves an on-site visit and results in an affidavit, which may be in either summary or
  question and answer format. AFCARO has final decision authority as to whether to fund
  either a verbatim recording of a fact-finding conference (FFC) or verbatim transcription of
  witness testimony. If the EO director and/or the LLFSC representative desires a verbatim
  transcript of witness testimony, they will coordinate with AFCARO for a final decision on
  the type of investigation to be conducted. IRD investigators may not unilaterally impose a
  requirement for any complaint to be investigated by these methods or any other method that
  imposes additional costs. IRD investigators negotiate with the complainant or complainant’s
  representative for extensions to the 180-day time limit for processing complaints. EO
  directors, at the request of investigators, may act as intermediaries in these negotiations. In
  accordance with 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.108(e), agreements to extend the 180-day time limit
  must be in writing and included in the investigative file. The EO director will provide a copy
  to AFCARO.
  4.14.4. Upon completion of the investigation, IRD makes available an electronic copy of the
  Report of Investigation (ROI) and the investigative file on its web site. This copy has not
  been sanitized to remove Privacy Act information (see unit Security Manager regarding
  classified material). Bases with access to the file will download it directly; for bases without
  access, AFCARO will download the file and provide an un-sanitized copy to the installation
  EO director. EO directors and other base officials should not provide a copy of the ROI
  and/or the investigative file to complainants or their designated representatives, and should
  not create their own sanitized version of these files. IRD also provides AFCARO with one
  un-sanitized print copy of these files which AFCARO sanitizes in a consistent manner and
  provides (in printed copy form) to complainants and their designated representatives, along
  with the notification of further rights under the provisions of 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.108(f),
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                       81


   29 C.F.R. Section 1614.110, and 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.302(d)(2) (mixed cases). Further,
   the notice must state that if the complainant desires a Final Agency Decision (FAD) without
   an EEOC hearing, s/he must request it from AFCARO, and if s/ he requests an EEOC
   hearing (non-mixed case), s/he must request it directly from the EEOC district office
   AFCARO specifies. AFCARO tracks the 30-calendar day period for the complainant to elect
   further processing options.
   4.14.5. If the complainant does not request a hearing or a final Air Force decision without a
   hearing within 30 calendar days after receipt of the ROI and investigative file, AFCARO will
   notify the complainant that a final decision will be issued within 60 calendar days from the
   end of the 30 calendar day request period, and that further appeal rights will be provided at
   that time.
   4.14.6. EO directors will, in all formal complaints, immediately electronically transmit any
   request for hearing, settlement agreement, or withdrawal to AFCARO.
4.15. Hearings.
   4.15.1. EO directors, in coordination with the agency representative, will make all needed
   arrangements as outlined in EEOC MD-110, Chapter 7, Hearings.
   4.15.2. The notice to the EEOC district office that services their area is issued by AFCARO
   and will include:
      4.15.2.1. Instructions to send the AJ’s final decision and two copies of the hearing
      transcript to AFCARO.
      4.15.2.2. The name, address and telephone number of the agency representative.
      4.15.2.3. A tabbed and bound copy of the complaint file, including the investigative file.
      With few exceptions, AFCARO prepares and submits complaint file to EEOC for
      Hearing.
   4.15.3. The complainant must submit the request for a hearing directly to EEOC with a copy
   to AFCARO. [29 C.F.R. Section 1614.108(g)] If the EO director receives a copy of the
   request for a hearing from the complainant, s/he in turn, will provide a copy of the request for
   a hearing to AFCARO.
   4.15.4. Upon receipt of the AJ’s decision, AFCARO will furnish a copy of the decision to
   LLFSC and the installation EO director and will advise the EO director of the projected date
   on which a final agency action will have to be issued in order to meet the EEOC 40-day time
   limit. LLFSC will return any extra copies of hearing transcripts and investigative files to
   AFCARO. Installation EO directors will in turn furnish copies of AJ’s decisions to the
   appropriate parties, such as commanders, CPS and SJA. AFCARO will furnish a copy of the
   AJ decision to the MAJCOM and A1Q.
   4.15.5. The installation EO office and CPS will assist the agency representative with
   responding to discovery requests, setting up depositions, and responding to EEOC orders.
4.16. Final Agency Actions.
   4.16.1. All final actions (whether denominated final decisions or final orders) are prepared
   by AFCARO for review and signature by SAF/MRB. All proposed final actions will be
   reviewed for legal sufficiency by an authorized Air Force attorney before they are submitted
 82                                                          AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010


   to SAF/MRB for signature. In addition, proposed final orders resulting from findings of
   discrimination by an EEOC AJ shall be coordinated for appeal IAW paragraph 4.20.1.1.,
   before SAF/MRB issues the final order.
       4.16.1.1. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, formal complaints in which
       the complainant has elected to proceed under the Air Force EEO pilot program,
       Compressed Orderly Rapid Equitable (CORE), or similar follow on legislation, will be
       processed IAW with the guidelines applicable to the CORE (or other) process. If at any
       point prior to the issuance of a final decision by SAF/MRB the complainant ―opts out‖ of
       the CORE or other process, further processing of the complaint will continue under Part
       1614 and the provisions of this AFI will apply.
4.17. Negotiation of Settlements.
   4.17.1. The EO director, working with the SJA, management representative, the complainant
   and his/her representative, may negotiate a settlement of the complaint during the pre-
   complaint stage of the process (prior to the filing of a formal complaint) within the
   parameters set by the settlement authority. After a formal complaint has been filed, the
   agency representative has the authority to negotiate settlement of the complaint through
   negotiation, ADR or other approach. In complaints filed against persons in the grades of
   Colonel and above (or civilian equivalents), the commander with administrative control over
   the complainant is the primary settlement authority, but such authority may be delegated to
   subordinate personnel in coordination with SAF/GCA and the management representative.
   Investigators and AJs may also seek to resolve a complaint with the parties during the
   investigation and/or hearing.
   4.17.2. The settlement agreement may include remedial action, back pay, and attorney's fees
   and/or compensatory damages, if allowed by law. However, care should be taken not to
   stipulate that any compensatory damage amounts have been verified as claimed.
   Additionally, in age discrimination claims as well as reprisal claims based on prior age
   discrimination complaints, attorney’s fees and compensatory damages are not payable. Insert
   statutory language as required by Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, 29 U.S.C. 626,
   Subsections (f)(1) and (f)(2), as appropriate, whenever settling allegations of age
   discrimination.
   4.17.3. If the settlement binds an organization outside the authority of the relevant
   commander, the EO director/agency representative (whichever appropriate per 4.17.1),
   obtains written concurrence of an authorized official within that organization before the
   agreement is signed.
   4.17.4. Before having the settlement authority sign an agreement, the EO director/agency
   representative shall, obtain coordination of the SJA, CPS and AFPC (if appropriate) on
   personnel actions to be taken as a result of the agreement. Such coordination does not
   include a determination on the merits of the case or on the settlement. For settlement
   agreements resulting from an ADR proceeding, the agreement may be signed before formal
   coordination, contingent upon subsequent coordination and approval.
   4.17.5. The EO director/agency representative (whichever appropriate per paragraph 4.17.1)
   in coordination with CPS faxes copies of signed settlement agreements requiring action by
   Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) (e.g., cancellation /correction of
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                     83


   suspension actions, retroactive promotions, reinstatement of leave, etc.) to the servicing
   DFAS civilian payroll office immediately with copies of applicable SF (Standard Form) 50-
   B, Notification of Personnel Action.
   4.17.6. An allegation of violation of a settlement agreement is processed according to
   Paragraph 8.4 of this instruction.

Section 4E—Civilian Formal EO Class Complaints

4.18. Guidance and Processing Procedures.
   4.18.1. AF/A1Q develops policy and oversees the processing of all class complaints of
   discrimination. AF/A1Q, in coordination with SAF/GCA, helps LLFSC prepare the agency's
   position statements and briefs in class complaint proceedings, as appropriate.
      4.18.1.1. The CPS or HRO personally serves or designates a staff member to serve as a
      technical representative for class complaints. The CPS or HRO also ensures that
      applicable personnel records are maintained while a class complaint is pending.
   4.18.2. LLFSC provides legal advice on all administrative class complaint matters and
   designates the agency representative for all administrative class complaints, for serviced
   bases.
   4.18.3. The complainant must file a formal class complaint with the EO director no later
   than 15 calendar days after receipt of the final interview letter.               The agent or
   attorney/representative must sign the class complaint. It must identify the policy or practice
   adversely affecting the class as well as the action or matter adversely affecting the agent.
   4.18.4. Upon receipt of a formal class complaint, the EO director forwards the original and
   one copy of the case file to LLFSC, one copy to AF/A1Q, one copy to AFCARO, and one
   copy to the respective MAJCOM EO Strategic Advisor. The EO director also notifies the
   installation CPS or HRO and SJA.
   4.18.5. Within 30 calendar days of receipt of the written formal complaint, the Air Force
   representative, in coordination with AF/A1Q, forwards it to the EEOC district office with the
   counselor's final report and the Air Force recommendation to accept or dismiss based on the
   criteria at 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.107 and 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.204(a)(2). Copies are sent
   to AF/A1Q, LLFSC, AFCARO, and the EO director. The agency submission instructs
   EEOC to send its recommendation to AFCARO.
   4.18.6. The EEOC AJ decides whether to accept or dismiss a class complaint. Immediately
   upon receipt of the decision, AFCARO will forward it to SAF/GCA and LLFSC, and
   AFCARO will issue a final order within 40 calendar days after receipt, IAW 29 C.F.R.
   Section 1614.204(d)(7). A complaint dismissed as a class complaint may be filed as an
   individual complaint and processed accordingly, or dismissed as an individual complaint if
   one or more grounds exist under 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.107(a). AFCARO will notify the
   Complainant of decision along with his or her rights associated with the decision. AFCARO
   will also provide LLFSC and the EO office a copy. If the final order does not implement the
   AJ’s decision to accept a class complaint, the Air Force will simultaneously appeal the
   decision IAW 29 C.F.R. Sections 1614.204(d)(7) and 1614.403. The agent may appeal
   dismissal of a class complaint to the EEOC or file a civil action.
 84                                                             AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010


   4.18.7. When the EO director receives an individual complaint that s/he believes is related to
   a pending class complaint, the EO director will inform AF/A1Q and LLFSC of the issue(s)
   involved and the basis of the individual complaint, and provide a synopsis of the reasons for
   believing the individual complaint is related to a pending class complaint. Where
   appropriate, AF/A1Q and LLFSC will provide guidance on processing individual complaints
   related to pending class complaints.
   4.18.8. The EO director makes arrangements for the hearing after the EEOC has set a date
   for such an action. The EEOC will hold a hearing of the accepted class complaint and issue a
   report of findings and recommendations to AFCARO as the designated service agent for the
   Air Force. AFCARO will immediately notify AF/A1Q and LLFSC and provide copies of the
   report as appropriate. [29 C.F.R. Section 1614.204(h)].
   4.18.9. AF/A1Q and LLFSC, who represents the agency in all phases, are responsible for
   managing the processing of formal class complaints. Processing will be in accordance with
   29 C.F.R. Section 1614.204(e) through (k).

Section 4F—Civilian EO Mixed Case Complaints

4.19. Guidance and Processing Procedures.
   4.19.1. Processing of mixed case informal complaints and formal complaints will be in
   accordance with 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.105, Section 1614.106, Section 1614.107, and
   Section 1614.108 (a) through (d).
   4.19.2. An individual may file a mixed case appeal through the MSPB process or a mixed
   case complaint using the EEO discrimination complaint system, but not both. Whatever
   action the complainant files first, in writing, is considered the election. Merely receiving
   informal complaint counseling does not constitute an election; a formal complaint must be
   filed to restrict the complaint to the mixed case complaint system.
      4.19.2.1. When the complainant files a mixed case appeal, and the MSPB dismisses the
      appeal on jurisdictional grounds without a decision on its merits, a copy of the initial
      decision, and any subsequent decision issued by the full Board in response to the
      complainant’s Petition for Review, will be provided to AFCARO. AFCARO will
      promptly issue the complainant with notice of his/her right to file and EEO complaint
      concerning the matter at issue. (29 C.F.R. 1614.302 [b]).
   4.19.3. When a formal EEO complaint is accepted, the EO director advises the complainant
   that if a decision on the claims appealable to the MSPB is not issued within 120 calendar
   days of filing the mixed case complaint, the complainant may appeal the matter to the MSPB
   as specified at 5 C.F.R. Section 1201.154(b)(2) or file a civil action as specified in 29 C.F.R.
   Section 1614.310(g), but not both. (29 C.F.R. Section 1614.302 (d)[1][i]) .
   4.19.4. Upon completion of the investigation and receipt of the investigative file, AFCARO
   advises the complainant that a final decision will be issued on the claims appealable to the
   MSPB within 45 calendar days without a hearing.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                   85


   4.19.5. When a final Air Force decision is issued, AFCARO will advise the complainant of
   the right to appeal the matter to the MSPB (not EEOC) within 30 calendar days of receipt
   and the right to file a civil action as provided at 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.310. (29 C.F.R.
   Section 1614.302[d][3]) .
   4.19.6. Dismissal of a mixed case complaint on the basis of prior election of a mixed case
   appeal is as follows:
      4.19.6.1. If neither the MSPB nor the installation/center commander (director) (or vice
      commander or EO director exercising delegated authority) disputes MSPB jurisdiction,
      the claims involving actions appealable to the MSPB are dismissed IAW 29 C.F.R.
      Section 1614.107(a)(4). The dismissal letter will advise the complainant to notify the
      MSPB of the allegations of discrimination contained in the dismissed complaint. It also
      advises the complainant of the right to petition the EEOC to review the MSPB final
      decision on the discrimination issue. [29 C.F.R. Section 1614.302(c)(2)(i)]
      4.19.6.2. If the installation/center commander (director) (or vice commander/or EO
      director exercising delegated authority) or the MSPB questions the MSPB jurisdiction
      over the mixed case appeal, the EO director will hold the mixed case complaint in
      abeyance until the MSPB rules on the jurisdictional issue. The EO director notifies the
      complainant of the action being taken and instructs him or her to bring the allegation of
      discrimination to the attention of the MSPB.
      4.19.6.3. If the MSPB determines it has jurisdiction over the matter, the
      installation/center commander (director) (or vice commander or EO director exercising
      delegated authority), shall dismiss the mixed case complaint pursuant to 29 C.F.R.
      Section 1614.107(a). The EO director advises the complainant of the right to petition the
      EEOC to review the MSPB final decision on the discrimination issue.
      4.19.6.4. If the MSPB determines it does not have jurisdiction over the mixed case
      appeal, the EO director recommences processing of the mixed case complaint as a non-
      mixed case EEO complaint.

Section 4G—Civilian EO Complaint Appeals

4.20. Guidance and Processing Procedures.
   4.20.1. In accordance with AFPD 51-3, Civil Litigation, and AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation,
   any appearance or representation before the EEOC, or the filing of briefs, motions or other
   pleadings with the EEOC, will be conducted by an attorney authorized by the Judge
   Advocate General or the General Counsel.
   4.20.2. Complainant Appeals. The servicing SJA has primary responsibility as agency
   representative in all appeals initiated by the complainant under 29 C.F.R. Section
   1614.401(a).
      4.20.2.1. AFCARO is the central receipt point for all appeals. Upon receipt, AFCARO
      will forward the appeal to the servicing SJA, and will concurrently send the appeal and a
      request for the complaint file to the installation/center EO director responsible for
      processing the complaint. The installation EO director will forward the complaint file to
      AFCARO, with a copy to the servicing SJA. AFCARO will file the complaint file with
86                                                           AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010


     EEOC/OFO within 30 days of initial notification of the complainant’s appeal. [29 C.F.R.
     Section 1614.403(e)]
  4.20.3. AFCARO will establish suspense for response to the appeal. When the LLFSC is the
  servicing SJA, the LLFSC will coordinate the Air Force legal position with the installation
  SJA and SAF/GCA as appropriate. AFCARO will file all appeal briefs directly with
  EEOC/OFO, IAW 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.403, with service on the complainant and the
  complainant’s designated representative, and provide copies of all filings to the installation
  SJA for inclusion in their respective complaint files.
  4.20.4. An unfavorable decision on an EEOC/OFO appeal will be processed for possible
  Request for Reconsideration (RFR) IAW the procedures in Section H.
  4.20.5. Agency Appeals. SAF/MRB is the final decision authority on all appeals to the
  EEOC/ OFO initiated by the Air Force. The servicing legal office has primary responsibility
  as agency representative before the EEOC/OFO in all agency-initiated appeals.
  4.20.6. If the servicing legal office believes an appeal is appropriate, the servicing legal
  office will notify SAF/MRB, and will provide AFCARO a draft brief supporting the
  recommended appeal in sufficient time for SAF/MRB to decide whether an appeal should be
  filed. Although SAF/MRB makes the final decision on agency appeals, he/she will notify
  SAF/GCA of a proposed decision not to support a servicing legal office recommended
  agency appeal in sufficient time to elevate that decision if necessary.
  4.20.7. A final agency order that does not fully implement the decision of an EEOC AJ must
  be accompanied by a simultaneous appeal to the EEOC, IAW 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.110(a).
  Upon receipt of an AJ decision finding of discrimination, AFCARO will immediately
  forward the decision to SAF/GCA, the servicing legal office, USAF A1Q, the MAJCOM/EO
  Strategic Advisor, the installation SJA, and the installation EO director. Recommendations
  will be forwarded to AFCARO for consideration.
  4.20.8. If SAF/MRB issues a final order that does not fully implement the decision of the
  AJ, AFCARO will file the Agency Notice of Appeal form (see MD-110, Appendix O), with
  EEOC/OFO, including a copy of the final order, IAW 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.403.
  AFCARO will request the servicing legal office with responsibility for the complaint to
  prepare a brief or other documentation in support of the appeal, and will coordinate the Air
  Force legal position with the SJA and SAF/GCA as appropriate. AFCARO will file the brief
  or other statement in support of the appeal with the EEOC/OFO, with service on the
  complainant or the complainant’s designated representative, within 20 days of filing the
  notice of appeal. [29 C.F.R. Section 1614.403(d)]. AFCARO will file the complaint file with
  EEOC/ OFO within 30 days of filing the notice of appeal. [29 C.F.R. Section 1614.403(e)]
  4.20.9. If EEOC/OFO grants the agency appeal, AFCARO will notify SAF/GCA, AF/A1Q,
  the MAJCOM Strategic Advisor, the servicing legal office, the LLFSC, the installation SJA
  and the installation/center EO director. If EEOC/OFO denies the appeal, AFCARO will
  initiate action to establish compliance and notify the parties of their right to request
  reconsideration in accordance with Section 4H.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                            87


Section 4H—Request for Reconsiderations (RFR)

4.21. Guidance and Processing Procedures.
   4.21.1. Recommendations to file an RFR must be transmitted to the servicing legal office
   and AFCARO within three business days of receipt of the decision from AFCARO, and any
   brief or other documentation supporting the RFR must be provided to the servicing legal
   office within 15 calendar days of AFCARO receiving the decision of EEOC/OFO. The
   servicing legal office will assess the propriety of an RFR and notify AFCARO of its
   recommendation. Recommendations to file an RFR should focus on the grounds identified by
   the EEOC in 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.405(b), i.e., the appellate decision involved a clearly
   erroneous interpretation of fact or law, or the decision will have a substantial impact on the
   policies, practices, or operations of the Air Force. Upon receipt of a recommendation from
   the servicing legal office to file an RFR, the brief will be sent to AFCARO for decision. If
   filed, AFCARO will file the RFR with EEOC/OFO within 30 days of receipt of the appellate
   decision by AFCARO, IAW 29 C.F.R. Section 1614.405(b), with copies of the RFR to
   SAF/GCA, AF/A1Q, the installation SJA, and the installation/center EO Director.
   4.21.2. SAF/MRB will consider all recommendations in determining whether to file a RFR
   or not. If SAF/MRB disagrees with the servicing legal office’s recommendation on whether
   to file an RFR, it will notify SAF/GCA and the servicing legal office of the disagreement in
   sufficient time to elevate the decision if necessary. If SAF/MRB or higher authority decides
   not to file the RFR, the decision is final. If SAF/MRB or higher authority decides to file an
   RFR, the brief will be sent to AFCARO for decision. If filed, AFCARO will file the RFR
   with EEOC/OFO within 30 days of receipt of the appellate decision by AFCARO, IAW 29
   C.F.R. Section 1614.405(b), with copies of the RFR to SAF/GCA, AF/A1Q, the installation
   SJA, and the installation/center EO director.
   4.21.3. Upon disposition of the RFR by EEOC/OFO, AFCARO will notify SAF/GCA,
   LLFSC, AF/A1Q, the servicing legal office, and the MAJCOM EO Strategic Advisor of the
   disposition for appropriate action.

Section 4I—Anonymous Complaints

4.22. Guidance and Processing Procedures. The EO office will ensure that an anonymous
complaint of discrimination on any basis is documented on the AF Form 1271 as EO General
Assistance/Contact and if the complaint is pursued, ensures that the complaint intake form
reflects sufficient details to clarify the complaint and indicate that the source is reliable. As in all
EEO complaints, the EO director has the responsibility of informing the installation/center
commander (director) and briefing her/him on complaints raised by employees (complainants)
when brought to the EO office, whether or not they relate to EEO matters. The Commander may
decide an investigation outside of the EEO realm is appropriate (e.g. CDI, talk to the RMO of the
shop involved, etc.). Keep in mind those interviewed in connection with the matter may be able
to determine the identity of the individual making the complaint. However, in accordance with
29 CFR 1614.105(g), the EO specialist/counselor will not reveal the identity of the accuser.
Additionally, complainants have the right to anonymity only up to the point of filing a formal
civilian EO complaint.

Section 4J—National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) EEO Complaint Processing
Responsibilities

4.23. NRO Responsibilities.
   4.23.1. The Director of the NRO (DNRO) serves also as the Assistant to the Secretary of the
   Air Force for Intelligence Space Technology, and operates as the official exercising
   delegated appointing authority over AF personnel under his or her direction. Accordingly,
   and pursuant to responsibilities outlined under this AFI, the DNRO is responsible for the
   NRO EEO complaint program and the Director of the Office of Equal Employment
   Opportunity and Diversity Management (D/OEEO&DM), as a direct report to the DNRO,
   manages the NRO’s EEO Program.
      4.23.1.1. The NRO D/OEEO&DM will:
      4.23.1.2. Administer the NRO EEO Program pursuant to Equal Employment
      Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines, Federal laws, Executive Orders and Air
      Force policy directives and instructions, and keep the DNRO fully informed of program
      activity.
      4.23.1.3. To the extent possible as outlined in this AFI, function as the Installation EO
      director, providing EEO complaint processing services to AF civilian personnel who
      enter the EEO process directly with NRO OEEO&DM.
      4.23.1.4. Manage the EEO complaint program that the DNRO controls; coordinate
      complaint-processing activities, including Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR); and
      maintain complete EEO complaint data in the AF EO IT system, or its equivalent,
      information system.
      4.23.1.5. Advocate and ensure the availability of an ADR process as an optional avenue
      to resolve EEO disputes. When both parties to a complaint agree to ADR, the
      D/OEEO&DM may request a third-party neutral from the DoD Civilian Personnel
      Management Service, Investigations and Resolutions Division (CPMS/IRD), an
      Intelligence Community agency, or from SAF/GCD. The NRO may fund expenses for
      contract neutrals or, upon request, SAF/GCD may fund expenses for Air Force neutrals
      brought in on travel.
      4.23.1.6. Coordinate all proposed and final settlement agreements with AFCARO, NRO
      Office of General Counsel (OGC), NRO Air Force Space Element Civilian Personnel
      Office (AFCPO), and, if necessary, the Commander of the Air Force Space Command
      Element (AFSPC ELEM) and AFPC, to include Career Program officials.
      4.23.1.7. AFCARO will issue the ROI/IF and FAD.
      4.23.1.8. Upon a finding or judgment, coordinate with NRO representatives any payment
      out of USAF funds allocated to the NRO.
4.24. Legal Guidance and Determination. Each Party will be responsible for obtaining legal
guidance regarding the processing of complaints of discrimination. AFCARO will coordinate
with AFLOA for litigation of AF EEO cases where a hearing is requested or a case has been
appealed.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                       89


                                            Chapter 5

            EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND TREATMENT INCIDENTS (EOTI)

5.1. Identifying EOTIs. EOTIs are distinctly different than unlawful discrimination or sexual
harassment complaints and therefore have different processing procedures. An EOTI is an overt,
adverse act, occurring on or off base, directed toward an individual, group or institution which is
motivated by, or has overtones based on race, color, national origin, religion or sex which has the
potential to have a negative impact on the installation human relations climate. An EOTI may
include subjects other than military members, retirees, or family members.
   5.1.1. Incidents motivated by race, color, national origin, religion or sex are those in which
   the race, color, national origin, religion, or sex of those involved is perceived to have been a
   primary factor in its occurrence.
   5.1.2. Incidents with overtones occur when race, color, national origin, religion or sex of
   those involved is perceived to have been a contributing factor in the occurrence or severity of
   the incident.
   5.1.3. Incidents may include, but are not limited to, the following elements: The use of a
   slur(s) based on race, color, national origin, religion or sex (resulting in a physical/verbal
   altercation), vandalism/degrading graffiti, hate group activity, or the use and/or posting of
   discriminatory epithets, signs or symbols. Sex offenses and other crimes are not EOTIs
   merely because the individuals are of different sexes, races, etc. The EO office must not
   report sexual offenses, to include sexual assaults, indecent exposure, obscene telephone
   calls, rape, child abuse, molestation or incest, as EOTIs. The EO office will immediately
   report sexual offenses and other alleged crimes to Security Forces (SF) or office of Special
   Investigations (OSI) for investigation and reporting through their systems.
5.2. Classifying EOTIs. The EO director, with the concurrence of the installation/center
commander (director), classifies the incident. The commander’s/director’s judgment regarding
the overall significance of the incident may influence the classification. The EO office must
record each incident that closes during a reporting period on AF Form 3018.
   5.2.1. EOTI’s are classified as either minor, serious or major incident based on the following
   criteria:
       5.2.1.1. Minor incidents include any of the following: Less than 10 active participants,
       assault, an act resulting in minor physical injury requiring no medical inpatient treatment
       or property damages of less than $1,000.
       5.2.1.2. Serious incidents include any of the following: 10 to 20 active participants,
       assault, an act resulting in physical injuries requiring medical inpatient treatment of less
       than 5 days or property damages of $1,000 to $10,000.
       5.2.1.3. Major incidents include any of the following: more than 20 active participants;
       an act that results in a death; arson; property damages in excess of $10,000; an act
       resulting in physical injuries requiring medical inpatient treatment for more than 5 days;
       or the activities of groups supporting supremacist causes, advocating unlawful
       discrimination, or otherwise advocating the use or threat of force or violence to deprive
 90                                                            AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010


      individuals of their civil rights when such activities constitute an immediate danger to the
      loyalty, good order and discipline or morale of Air Force personnel.
      5.2.1.4. The EO office will use the most severe qualifying factor to determine the
      classification of an incident. An example is, if an incident occurs involving three active
      participants and resulted in death, the EO office would classify the incident as major and
      not minor.
      5.2.1.5. The EO office will also report incidents that do not meet the specific criteria
      listed but could affect the local human relations climate or could result in adverse media
      coverage affecting the Air Force (see paragraph 5.3. of this instruction).
      5.2.1.6. The EO will ensure case synopses are specific and fully detailed.
      5.2.1.7. When an incident occurs that falls within the criteria above for a minor or
      serious EOTI but may have a significant adverse effect on the installation HRC (i.e.
      adverse media coverage, off-base demonstrations, etc.), the EO office may recommend
      the installation/center commander (director) classify the EOTI as serious or major.
      Conversely, when an incident occurs that falls within the criteria above for a serious or
      major EOTI, but has very little or no adverse effect on the installation HRC, in some rare
      instances, the EO office may recommend the installation/center commander (director)
      classify the EOTI as minor or serious.
5.3. Reporting EOTIs.
   5.3.1. All incidents are reported via electronic message. The EO office generates the
   message and is responsible for all subsequent messages. At a minimum, three messages are
   required (initial, follow-up, and final), and must be classified as minor, serious, or major.
   When the EO office cannot make an exact determination, they will report those incidents as
   ―possible‖ incidents. Except for instances that involve physical injury, arson or death, the
   EO office may use some latitude in the classification of an incident. Note: A follow-up
   message is not required in cases where a clarification is completed in less than 30 calendar-
   days.
      5.3.1.1. Minor and Serious Incidents. The EO office will report all minor and serious
      incidents to AFPC/EO workflow (eo.workflow@randolph.af.mil) with information
      copies to AF/A1Q workflow (afa1q.workflow@pentagon.af.mil) and their respective
      MAJCOM EO Strategic Advisor within 72 hours after notification (Refer to EO CoP for
      sample EOTI message format). The EO office must forward follow-up notifications every
      30 calendar-days until final action is taken.
   5.3.2. Major Incidents. The Operations Support Center will report EOTIs categorized as
   major incidents through the Event and Incident Report (OPREP - 3), RCS: HAF-A30 (AR)
   7118.
   5.3.3. In addition to OPREP-3 reporting requirements, the EO office will report major
   incidents by priority message to AF/A1Q, AFPC/EO, and respective MAJCOM EO Strategic
   Advisors within 24 hours of notification.
   5.3.4. Send follow-up notification messages to AF/A1Q, AFPC/EO, and respective
   MAJCOM EO Strategic Advisors every 30 calendar-days until final action is taken.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                       91


   5.3.5. Send final notification messages to AF/A1Q, AFPC/EO, and respective MAJCOM EO
   Strategic Advisors. The final notification will include all information previously reported in
   the initial notification, along with any new information gathered.
5.4. Clarifying EOTIs.
   5.4.1. The purpose of the EOTI clarification is to gather information to determine whether an
   incident involved violations of EO policy and, if appropriate, classify the incident. The EO
   director and the EO staff respond to and clarify all possible EOTIs. Barring extenuating
   circumstances, EOTI clarifications should not exceed 60 calendar-days. An explanation of
   why the clarification exceeded 60 calendar-days will be annotated in follow-up and final
   reporting messages.
   5.4.2. The EOTI clarification process determines the facts and causes of the incident,
   develops recommendations for the installation/center commander (director) concerning the
   classification of the incident and corrective action taken and assesses the severity of the
   incident and its impact on morale, good order, discipline and unit effectiveness.
   5.4.3. The clarification may include information from other investigative agencies.
   5.4.4. The clarification may require interviewing or taking statements from persons
   (potential witnesses and alleged offenders) who may have information relevant to the
   incident. Do not interview military members represented by the Area Defense Council
   (ADC) or civilian counsel without the consent of counsel and comply with rights advisement
   requirements for unrepresented members.
   5.4.5. If, during the incident clarification, a witness makes an incriminating statement, stop
   the interview, brief the EO director and contact SJA and member’s commander for further
   guidance.
   5.4.6. The EO office must coordinate the clarification with SJA and have installation/center
   commander (director) approval before conducting interviews involving members assigned to
   other branches of the Armed Forces and with off-base civilians.
   5.4.7. The EO office will avoid overlapping or interfering with on-going investigations
   conducted by other agencies. Consult with law enforcement agencies or others who are
   investigating the incident and work as subject matter experts if possible. Law enforcement
   investigations have priority over EOTI clarifications.
   5.4.8. Upon completion of incident clarification report, the EO office will forward to SJA for
   review and consultation. After SJA review, the installation/center commander (director) will
   make the final determination on the classification and release of the final notification. (Refer
   to EO CoP for a sample Incident Clarification Report.)
5.5. Numbering EOTIs. Every EOTI is assigned a docket number. The docket number is
determined by combining two separate elements: the case type code and the case file number.
   5.5.1. Case Type Code. There is one type of case file code ―EI‖.
   5.5.2. Case File Number: The EO office document and manages EOTIs by EO docket
   number. EOTI docket number includes the first four of the passcode (MPE Id and
   MAJCOM)-the last two digits of the fiscal year- a numerical case number assigned
   consecutively.
 92                                                             AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010


   5.5.3. Followed by Two Letter MPE code. Every Air Force base has a two-letter MPE code.
   This is the same two-letter code used when updating personnel records in the PDS (e.g., ―RJ‖
   = Randolph AFB ―OJ‖ = AETC MAJCOM).
   5.5.4. Case File Number. The case file number consists of the last two digits of the calendar
   year (e.g., 09 = 2009, 01 = 2010, etc.) followed by the sequence of the EOTI (01, 02, etc.,
   with numbers reverting back to 01 at the beginning of every calendar year.
   5.5.5. Example: EI-RJOJ-09-03 = an EOTI from Randolph AFB which occurred in CY
   2009 and was the third EOTI of the year.
   5.5.6. The EO office will include case numbers on all correspondence to higher headquarters
   referencing an EOTI, to include all formal reporting procedures.
   5.5.7. When EOTIs involve subjects assigned to a tenant organization, the host EO office
   will forward information copies of initial, follow-up and final notifications to the responsible
   tenant organization.
5.6. Joint Service Equal Opportunity and Treatment Incident Notification Procedures.
   5.6.1. AF/A1Q will develop policy guidance to ensure current procedures regarding Joint
   Service notification are provided to the ―Operations Center/Command Post to notify Joint
   Service Commanders and Defense Agency Chief’s when members of their
   organizations/units are involved in Equal Opportunity and Treatment Incidents (EOTI’s).
   5.6.2. Ensure the incident notification message provides detailed information identifying the
   incident participants, location of the incident, and unit of assignment. Ensure the message is
   forwarded to the appropriate Joint Service/Component Commander or Defense Agency Chief
   for information and necessary corrective action.
   5.6.3. The installation/theater/center commander (director) makes the final determination on
   the classification of the incident and approves release of the notification message.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                     93


                                          Chapter 6

                             DISABILITY ACCOMODATION

6.1. Accommodation Obligation.
   6.1.1. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC §791 et seq.) as amended by the Americans
   with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (42 USC §12101 et seq.) requires all Federal
   agencies to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities who
   are employees or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause undue hardship.
   6.1.2. In general, an accommodation is any change in the work environment or in the way
   things are customarily done that enables an individual with a disability to enjoy equal
   employment opportunities. 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 app. § 1630.2(o).
   6.1.3. Disability Accommodation is a case-specific and fact-specific process. The EEOC’s
   ―Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the
   Americans        with        Disabilities Act‖       dated     October       17,      2002
   (http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html) and the Air Force ―Plan for
   Employment and Development of People with Disabilities and Reasonable Accommodation
   Procedures‖                        dated                  January                     2010
   (http://www.afpc.randolph.af.mil/afcivilianjobs/resources.asp)       provide    controlling
   guidance on this issue. Whenever dealing with a reasonable accommodation request, consult
   your servicing legal office.
6.2. Qualified Individual with a Disability.
   6.2.1. A qualified individual with a disability is an individual with a physical or mental
   impairment, or a record of having such an impairment, that substantially limits one or more
   major life activities, who can, with or without reasonable accommodation, perform the
   essential functions of the position that the individual holds or desires. An individual only
   ―regarded as‖ having such an impairment is not entitled to reasonable accommodation.
6.3. Undue Hardship.
   6.3.1. Employers do not have to provide any accommodation that would pose an undue
   hardship on the operation of the Agency.
   6.3.2. Undue hardship focuses on the resources and circumstances of the particular employer
   in relationship to the cost or difficulty of providing a specific accommodation and refers to
   reasonable accommodations that are unduly extensive, substantial, or disruptive, or those that
   would fundamentally alter the nature or operation of the business.
6.4. Reasonable Accommodation.
   6.4.1. Reasonable accommodation may include, but is not limited to:
       6.4.1.1. Making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by
       persons with disabilities;
       6.4.1.2. Job restructuring, modifying work schedules, or reassignment of a current
       employee to a vacant position; and
 94                                                            AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010


       6.4.1.3. Acquiring or modifying equipment or devices, adjusting or modifying
       examinations, training materials, or policies, and providing qualified readers or
       interpreters.
   6.4.2. An employer is not obligated to provide personal use items such as glasses or hearing
   aids.
   6.4.3. An employer is not required to remove an essential function of the job as an
   accommodation.
   6.4.4. An employer shall hold employees with disabilities to the same standards of
   performance and conduct as other similarly situated employees without disabilities. An
   employee with a disability must meet the same production standards, whether quantitative or
   qualitative, as a non-disabled employee in the same job. Lowering or changing a production
   standard because an employee cannot meet it due to a disability is not considered a
   reasonable accommodation.
6.5. Interactive Process.
   6.5.1. A request for reasonable accommodation is the first step in an informal, interactive
   process between the individual and the employer.
   6.5.2. There is no requirement that the request be in writing and there are no specific forms
   or terms that an individual must use to request an accommodation.
   6.5.3. The request may come from the individual, family member, friend, health care
   professional, or representative.
   6.5.4. When the accommodation request involves or affects job performance, and using a
   problem solving approach, an employer should:
       6.5.4.1. Analyze the particular job involved and determine its purpose and essential
       functions;
       6.5.4.2. Consult with the individual with a disability to ascertain the precise job-related
       limitations imposed by the individual's disability and how those limitations could be
       overcome with a reasonable accommodation;
       6.5.4.3. In consultation with the individual to be accommodated, identify potential
       accommodations and assess the effectiveness each would have in enabling the individual
       to perform the essential functions of the position;
       6.5.4.4. Consult with the installation Disabilities Program Manager and SJA. Unusual or
       difficult questions about requested accommodations may be referred to the HAF/A1Q
       Disabilities Program Manager or to SAF/GCA.
       6.5.4.5. Consider the preference of the individual to be accommodated and select and
       implement the accommodation that is most appropriate for both the employee and the
       employer. The employer need not provide the employee’s preferred accommodation.
       The employer may choose among reasonable accommodations as long as the chosen
       accommodation is effective.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                      95


   6.5.5. When the request for accommodation involves the application process or access to a
   benefit or privilege of employment, a similar approach to that outlined above should be used.
   6.5.6. As a general rule, the individual with a disability – who has the most knowledge about
   the need for reasonable accommodation – must inform the employer that an accommodation
   is needed. However, the employer should initiate the reasonable accommodation interactive
   process without being asked if the employer: (1) knows that the employee has a disability, (2)
   knows, or has reason to know, that the employee is experiencing workplace problems
   because of the disability, and (3) knows, or has reason to know, that the disability prevents
   the employee from requesting a reasonable accommodation. If the individual with a
   disability states that he or she does not need a reasonable accommodation, the employer will
   have fulfilled its obligation.
6.6. Medical Documentation.
   6.6.1. Medical Documentation.       When the disability or the need for reasonable
   accommodation is not obvious, employers may request reasonable medical documentation to
   determine whether an individual requesting accommodation has a disability.
   6.6.2. Reasonable documentation means that the employer may require only the
   documentation that is needed to establish that a person has a disability as stipulated in the
   Rehabilitation Act, and that the disability necessitates a reasonable accommodation.
   6.6.3. Employers may also request information to document the need for accommodation
   and to help determine appropriate accommodations.
   6.6.4. In most cases, employers cannot request complete medical records because such
   records may reveal information that is not relevant to determining whether the employee has
   a disability or needs an accommodation. Requests for medical information should be
   narrowly tailored to answer specific questions to help determine if the individual has a
   disability and/or if reasonable accommodation is needed (and if so, what specifically is
   required as a reasonable accommodation). Any medical information obtained from an
   employee shall be collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files
   and be treated as a confidential medical record, except when disclosure is required to inform
   supervisors of necessary restrictions or accommodations or for emergency medical treatment.
6.7. Denial of Accommodation Requests.
   6.7.1. Denials of reasonable accommodation must be in writing and include specific reasons
   for the denial and the employee or office that made the decision. A denial must notify the
   individual that s/he has a right to file an EEO complaint, the procedures for doing so, as well
   as identify and explain any avenues available for informal dispute resolution.
   6.7.2. If an alternate accommodation is approved, the written notification should explain
   both the reasons for the denial of the original accommodation and the reasons it is believed
   the chosen alternative will be effective.

                                           Chapter 7

      EQUAL OPPORTUNITY OPERATIONS IN THE DEPLOYED ENVIRONMENT

7.1. EO Presence in the Area of Responsibility (AOR).
   7.1.1. The Air Force will identify trained military EO professionals for Air and Space
   Expeditionary Force (AEF) rotational support for global contingency operations consistent
   with requirements established by the Commander, of Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR).
   Normally, each Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) will warrant at least one EO requirement.
   For deployments smaller than an AEF, deployed commanders must provide an EO capability
   consistent with the requirements of this AFI.
   7.1.2. For emerging operations, when practicable, the Air Component A1 should coordinate
   development of any EO requirements with the EO Functional Area Manager (EO FAM) at
   AFPC/EO. The Air Component A1 and the FAM should keep in mind the COMAFFOR’s
   responsibility to ensure theater-wide support to Airmen in smaller units at potentially isolated
   sites, and determine if central or regional management can be effective.
   7.1.3. During transition to sustained operations, the Air Component A1 planner must
   account for future rotations and coordinate those requirements with the EO FAM. Ensure

   complaints are handled using the procedures discussed in Chapter 4 of this instruction. All
   EO professionals have authority to assist parties in drafting and executing settlement
   agreements in the pre-complaint stage, within the parameters set by the settlement authority.
   Agency representatives have the authority to negotiate settlements, within the parameters set
   by the settlement authority, after a formal complaint has been filed.
   8.1.2. An AF official is properly a settlement authority if s/he has the authority to grant the

   properly. If the settlement binds an organization outside the authority of the relevant
   commander, the EO director or ADR Manager obtains written concurrence of an authorized
   official within that organization before the agreement is signed. For settlement agreements
   resulting from an ADR proceeding, the agreement may be signed before formal coordination,
   contingent upon subsequent coordination and approval. Such a contingency should be made
   clear to the parties prior to signature.
   8.2.5. Draft settlement agreements according to the sample agreements provided in the Air
   Force ADR Compendium. For civilian EO complaints alleging age discrimination, care
   should be taken with regard to specific requirements of the Age Discrimination in
   Employment Act.

   applicable Standard Form 50-B.
   8.3.4. Collect documentation from the responsible office(s) indicating execution of their
   action and retain in the EO office with the original settlement agreement and follow
   disposition instructions according to Air Force Records Information Management System

   12.1.2. The objective of the UCA is to provide unit commanders insight into positive and
   negative factors that may impact unit effectiveness and the unit’s human relations
   environment.
   12.1.3. Conducting the UCA. The EO office uses the following tools, individually or in
   combination, to conduct the UCA: survey distribution and analysis, individual interviews,
   observations, focus groups, unit trend data (see paragraph 12.7.2) and reports. The UCA
   team must obtain the unit commander’s approval of the methods used to assess unit
   effectiveness prior to conducting the UCA.
12.2. UCA Requirements.
   12.2.1. The EO office will brief the UCA program to all commanders during the KPB.
   12.2.2. The EO office must conduct UCAs on units with more than 50 personnel assigned
   every two years or upon a unit commander’s request. Unit commanders can delay the start of
   their UCA due to mission requirements, but may not waive the requirement to conduct a
   UCA every two years. If a UCA is delayed, the EO specialist will place a memorandum for
   record in unit continuity folder explaining the delay.
   12.2.3. Participation in the UCA program for military members and civilian employees is
   strictly voluntary. Unit commanders should encourage unit members to participate in
   surveys and/or interviews.
   12.2.4. If during the UCA, a member of the unit files an EO complaint of unlawful
   discrimination or sexual harassment, the EO office will brief the unit commander on the
   circumstances and impact of the complaint on the UCA. After the EO office briefs the
   impact of the complaint on the UCA, the unit commander will determine whether to
   continue, suspend or terminate the UCA. The unit commander has the option to suspend the
   UCA if the individual circumstances of a specific case may detract from an objective
   assessment of the overall HRC.
   12.2.5. Upon written request of the unit commander, NAF and bargaining unit AF civil
   service employees may participate in the UCA. The unit commander must coordinate a
   memorandum requesting inclusion of civilian employees with the Chief of the servicing CPS,
   the union representative, and HRO for NAF employees prior to beginning a UCA for each
   unit assessed. The UCA team chief will file the coordinated memorandum in the unit’s
   continuity folder. Note: The participation of civilian employees in a UCA is strictly
   voluntary. Contractor employees and host country nationals will not be included in the UCA.
   Unit commanders who want to survey contractor personnel must work through the
   appropriate contracting officer to develop an alternative survey method.

   12.2.6. The EO office must use the Air Force approved survey and program to accomplish
   required UCAs. Other survey tools are not authorized unless approved by AFPC/EO.
12.3. Team Composition.
   12.3.1. The UCA team will consist of the EO director and EO specialists. The number of
   team members will vary according to local mission, priorities and staffing.
   12.3.2. The EO director will appoint an EO specialist to serve as the UCA team chief.
12.4. Initial Preparation.
   12.4.1. The team chief will assign team members to tasks and responsibilities such as survey
   administration, interviews, data gathering and report writing.
   12.4.2. Prior to the visit, the team will review and assess the unit’s mission, organizational
   structure, work center locations, duty hours and demographic composition of unit personnel.
   This will provide the team with a preliminary picture of the unit.
   12.4.3. The team will review all closed EO formal cases, informal cases, informal assistance,
   and EO incidents related to the unit to determine trend data. The team must then assess the
   potential impact of any trend data on the unit’s HRC. The team should review past UCA
   reports from the unit.
   12.4.4. The team chief will brief the commander on the approximate time frame required for
   the visit and make arrangements for the necessary facilities and required resources.
   12.4.5. The team chief will schedule all required briefings in advance with the unit
   commander or the commander’s designated representative. Note: The number of unit
   members randomly selected should never fall below the number identified in table 12.1.
12.5. Types of Climate Assessments.
   12.5.1. There are three UCA types which provide the commander with flexibility.
   12.5.2. Type I UCA. This type will be the primary assessment method for assessing an
   organization’s human relations climate. It is the most comprehensive method.
       12.5.2.1. It includes unit trend analysis (data gathering), survey access code distribution,
       survey analysis, individual interviews or focus groups derived from the survey analysis
       and a final written report. Type I UCAs will be completed within 60 duty days (unless
       extenuating circumstances) after the in-brief date (this includes the completion of the
       final report). (AFRC installations will complete Type I UCAs within six UTAs.)
   12.5.3. Type II UCA. This type includes unit trend analysis (data gathering), survey access
   code distribution, survey analysis and requires a final written report. Type II UCAs will be
   completed within 30 duty days (unless extenuating circumstances) after the in- brief date
   (this includes the completion of the final report). (AFRC installations will complete Type II
   UCAs within six UTAs.)
   12.5.4. Type III UCA. This type includes interviews only and requires a final written report
   containing the results and analysis. This type is usually used for units with fewer than 50
   personnel. Type III UCAs will be completed within 30 duty days after the in-brief date (this
   includes the completion of the final report). (AFRC installations will complete Type III
   UCAs within six UTAs.)
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                 109


12.6. UCA Briefings.
   12.6.1. The required number of briefings is determined by the UCA type the commander
   selects.
   12.6.2. Type I requires three briefings; in-brief, post-survey brief, and out-brief.
   12.6.3. Type II and III include two briefings; in-brief and out-brief.
   12.6.4. The commander determines who attends UCA briefings.
   12.6.5. In-brief (applies to all UCAs):
      12.6.5.1. The in-brief will be lead by the EO director and is designed to develop an
      integrated strategy on how to conduct the UCA to best meet the needs of the commander.
      The team chief describes the capabilities of the UCA team and solicits from the
      commander any specific needs or concerns that may require additional assessment or
      clarification.
      12.6.5.2. The team chief provides the commander with a copy of the survey and samples
      of additional survey questions for review.
      12.6.5.3. The commander must appoint an action officer, preferably an E-7 or above, to
      serve as a point of contact for the team.
      12.6.5.4. The commander or designated representative is responsible for notifying and
      scheduling unit personnel for survey participation, interviews and other administrative
      functions.
12.7. Data Gathering.
   12.7.1. The team must recognize the development of trends and potential problem areas that
   may affect unit effectiveness.
   12.7.2. Gather unit historical trend data, such as military/civilian complaint and incident
   data, personnel data (performance reports, promotions and awards), and legal data (Articles
   15 and Courts-Martial). The key is the availability of relevant data and the selection,
   compilation, analysis, and presentation of the material.
   12.7.3. There are several agencies in which you may gather data from. The UCA team
   should review information gathered from EO, IG, MPS, CPS, Human Resource Office
   (HRO), and SF to determine trends that may impact unit effectiveness.
   12.7.4. The UCA team must review the following:
      12.7.4.1. AF Form 1587, EO Complaint Summary.
      12.7.4.2. AF Form 1587-1, EO Informal Complaint Summary.
      12.7.4.3. AF Form 1271, Record of Assistance.
      12.7.4.4. EOTIs (minor, serious and major).
      12.7.4.5. DD Form 2655, Complaint of Discrimination in the Federal Government.
      12.7.4.6. Previous UCA Reports.

12.8. Survey Administration.
   12.8.1. The survey is a very important tool to the UCA process. The survey provides the
   commander insight into unit perceptions and serves as the starting point for developing
   personal interviews. When conducting UCA Type I or II, the UCA team will use the Air
   Force-approved UCA Survey to survey unit members. Team members and unit commanders
   may not delete or modify questions contained in the Air Force-approved UCA Survey. Unit
   commanders may, at their discretion, include up to 10 additional questions to the survey.
   12.8.2. The survey assesses and reports both positive and negative perceptions of a unit’s
   human relations climate that may potentially impact the EO climate, unit cohesion or mission
   effectiveness.
   12.8.3. Sample size. Survey responses must include a sufficient number of participants.
   Table 12.1. identifies suggested sample sizes associated with various unit populations.
   12.8.4. Survey caution. Survey responses may generate more questions than they answer;
   consequently, use the survey to develop interview questions, if applicable.
   12.8.5. Survey access code distribution. The team will emphasize survey access code
   distribution procedures when coordinating the UCA with the commander.
   12.8.6. Survey analysis. Upon survey termination date, the team will analyze survey results.
   12.8.7. Post-survey briefing (applies to Type I and II UCAs):
       12.8.7.1. Provides unit commanders with an analysis of survey responses from unit
       members. The analysis identifies human relations factors that may impact unit
       effectiveness and cohesion. It also identifies areas that may require further clarification
       through individual interviews or focus groups. Note: At the unit commander’s
       discretion, a UCA may transition between a Type I and a Type II assessment.
       12.8.7.2. The UCA team must redact any names within the verbatim survey comments
       prior to providing the comments to the unit commander at the post survey briefing.
       12.8.7.3. The team will prepare and develop a list of interview questions derived from
       the survey analysis (for Type I & III). The unit commander reviews and approves the
       interview questions. The unit commander may provide the team with additional questions
       which require clarification during the interview process.

19   181-90               97


NOTES:
1. Survey participation for units with less than 50 assigned personnel is highly
encouraged. In such cases, the team will allow all unit members the opportunity to
participate.
2. These sample sizes fall between a 90 percent confidence level, plus or minus six
percent.
 112                                                             AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010


12.9. Interviews.
     12.9.1. Conducting interviews is an integral part of UCA Types I and III. The team will
     consider the best interview method when gathering data, such as personal interviews, focus
     groups, or group interviews. Note: The unit commander must approve the interview
     method.
     12.9.2. Selection of Personnel. The number of personnel to be interviewed is based on the
     size of the unit and the capability of the team. Table 12.2., identifies recommended interview
     sample sizes based on unit populations.
     12.9.3. The team will select a representative mix of personnel in the unit based on sex, race,
     national origin, grade, AFSC and operational function.
     12.9.4. The team will also interview unit members from all work shifts.
     12.9.5. Allowing interviewees to elaborate on certain subjects may uncover new subjects of
     interest for the unit commander. Also, the unit commander may opt for option III (interviews
     only) when they have specific needs, issues and concerns requiring clarification.

     12.9.6. When survey responses reveal concerns specific to a group (e.g., group members
     perceive inequity in disciplinary actions or women perceive sexual harassment to be a
     problem), it may be important to schedule more individuals from that group to clarify the
     concern.
     12.9.7. Interview Scheduling. The unit commander, first sergeant, or liaison representative
     must inform unit members of the schedule and requirement for conducting interviews. When
     possible, conduct interview(s) at a neutral location. The interview office(s) or room(s)
     should be private and dedicated to the UCA team. It is recommended to schedule ―walk in‖
     times in order to allow for members who want to provide input may do so.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                     113


  12.9.8. Interview Questions. The survey, survey analysis, and specific unit commander
  concerns are the key sources for developing interview questions (options I and III). When
  required, trend data review (e.g., complaints, personnel actions, legal actions, or unit council
  concerns) will also be a source for follow-up questions. In all cases, the unit commander
  will approve interview questions.
  12.9.9. Interview Techniques.
     12.9.9.1. Explain to the interviewee the purpose and objective of the personal interview,
     focus group interview, or group interview.
     12.9.9.2. Explain to the interviewee that UCA team members do not have confidentiality,
     and if a legal issue or UCMJ violation surfaces, the UCA team chief will inform the
     proper authorities.
     12.9.9.3. Emphasize to the interviewee that participation is voluntary. The interviewee
     must concur with being interviewed.
     12.9.9.4. Do not use coercion or pressure.
     12.9.9.5. Explain the purpose of taking notes.
     12.9.9.6. Ask all questions on your list in an identical fashion.
     12.9.9.7. Limit questions to a single idea per question.
     12.9.9.8. Use open-ended questions, those facilitating open dialogue concerning positive
     and negative issues affecting the unit.
     12.9.9.9. Phrase questions so as not to suggest an appropriate response.
     12.9.9.10. Move from the general to specific information in order to capture useful data.
     12.9.9.11. Use language the interviewee will understand.
     12.9.9.12. Use transition statements to move from one question to another and to orient
     the respondent to new areas of discussion.
     12.9.9.13. Do not be judgmental or express your own views about interviewee responses.
     12.9.9.14. Pace the interview so all questions are covered; as a rule, individual
     interviews must not exceed 15-30 minutes. If interviewees desire to continue beyond
     their allotted time, provide them the option to visit your office at a later time.
     12.9.9.15. Interview Notes. Take short concise notes. Attempt to quantify responses
     where possible. Example: Ask interviewees to rate their responses on a scale of 1 to
     10. Annotate the demographics of the interviewee on the interview notes.
     12.9.9.16. If during the UCA interview, a military/civilian interviewee makes a request
     to file an EO complaint, the UCA team member will terminate the interview and
     immediately refer the interviewee to the Equal Opportunity (EO) Office. When the
     complainant is a civilian employee, the EO director will brief the unit commander on the
     circumstances of the complaint IAW chapter 4, paragraph 4.5.1.9 of this instruction.

   12.9.10. Out-brief (applies to all UCAs).
       12.9.10.1. The out-brief is required after all UCA information has been analyzed,
       evaluated and administratively processed. The out-brief will contain a synopsis of the
       survey analysis report, comments gathered from the surveys, relevant trend data, and
       anecdotal comments made by interviewees.
       12.9.10.2. Highlight relevant findings.
       12.9.10.3. Present relevant positive and negative findings to provide a balanced
       approach.
       12.9.10.4. Provide rationale and support for conclusions.
       12.9.10.5. Be prepared to conduct additional research into special interest issues if
       requested by the commander.
       12.9.10.6. Be straightforward and direct. Avoid condescending, defensive, or apologetic
       behavior.
       12.9.10.7. Discuss recommendations and strategies for problem resolution.
       12.9.10.8. Offer follow-up services to help resolve EO or managerial related problems.
       12.9.10.9. The team should not delve into job analysis, work distribution, and other
       organizational development areas. These assessment factors are not within the scope of
       the UCA program.
       12.9.10.10. For UCA Type II, the post survey briefing is sufficient and serves as the out-
       brief.
12.10. The Final Report.
   12.10.1. The final report culminates the UCA. It provides a record of the visit and
   summarizes relevant information gathered from trend data review, post survey briefing and
   interviews. The final report will not contain names, new or unexpected information, or
   verbatim comments extracted from the survey.
   12.10.2. The unit commander must receive the final written report no later than 15 duty days
   after the out-brief.
   12.10.3. Report accurately and clearly the information gathered during the assessment.
   When preparing the report, it is essential to stress the mission of the unit.
   12.10.4. All assessments require a written report. Note: The UCA team will not use a
   survey analysis in lieu of a written report.
   12.10.5. Preparing to write the report:
       12.10.5.1. Determine which activities in the unit are critical to mission accomplishment
       and what conditions hinder or help to accomplish those activities.
       12.10.5.2. Consider how the success or failure of critical unit activities may impact on
       unit effectiveness.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                  115


     12.10.5.3. Consider the impact on the unit’s effectiveness of resolving potential issues,
     such as: unit cohesion, fair treatment, unlawful discrimination, sexual harassment,
     interpersonal relationships, managerial concerns, channels of communications, and
     morale.
     12.10.5.4. Accurately describe the potential mission impact, as a result of adverse
     conditions identified during the UCA.
     12.10.5.5. Ensure all relevant data has been assembled.
     12.10.5.6. Tie associated areas together when the information relates to UCA topics, e.g.,
     unlawful discrimination, communication, or fair treatment.
     12.10.5.7. Correlate and integrate the findings from data gathering (trends), surveys, and
     personnel interviews.
     12.10.5.8. Report Content (Refer to EO CoP for final UCA Report template):
        12.10.5.8.1. The initial paragraph must consist of an introductory statement
        addressing the who, what, where, when, why, and how of the UCA.
        12.10.5.8.2. The second paragraph should give a demographic breakout of unit
        members who participated in the UCA process, including survey and interview
        participants. The breakout allows the unit commander to evaluate the relevance of
        information and to see whose views are represented. Note: The survey analysis
        report gives a breakout of participants.
        12.10.5.8.3. The third paragraph should contain an assessment of the unit's human
        relations climate. The report should include discussions of interactions based on
        national origin, color, race, sex or religion. Also, the team must consider AFSC,
        grade, and functional area when reporting.
        12.10.5.8.4. Subsequent paragraphs (for types I, II, or III) may be addressed by topic
        or issue. Each paragraph must incorporate findings from analysis of unit trends,
        surveys, and interviews (as applicable). The primary topics are:
            12.10.5.8.4.1. Cohesion and Pride.
            12.10.5.8.4.2. Motivation and Morale.
            12.10.5.8.4.3. Supervisory Support.
            12.10.5.8.4.4. Perceived Discrimination.
            12.10.5.8.4.5. Overt Discriminatory Behaviors.
            12.10.5.8.4.6. Command Military/Civilian EO Policies.
            12.10.5.8.4.7. Locally Developed Questions.
        12.10.5.8.5. The final paragraph must include team recommendations, if appropriate.
        12.10.5.8.6. The report should close with a statement expressing appreciation for the
        liaison representative’s support and unit member’s cooperation and participation in
        the UCA. Also should include a request for the unit commander to complete the
        UCA critique.
116                                                           AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010


         12.10.5.8.7. Any other analysis gathered by the UCA team (e.g., JA statistics,
         personnel data, results of other surveys, etc.) may be attached to the main report.
  12.10.6. Report Guidelines:
      12.10.6.1. Administrative Considerations. Administrative accuracy in the report is
      essential. Improper grammar or incorrect spelling detracts from the content and
      credibility of the UCA report. The report should be succinct with a logical flow of
      information and smooth transitions. This will greatly assist the commander when
      reviewing the report. The team should proofread the report and ensure the content is
      correct and written in a brief, clear, and concise manner.
      12.10.6.2. Content Considerations:
         12.10.6.2.1. Balanced Coverage. Avoid the tendency to concentrate on negative
         issues surfaced during the UCA. One-sided doom and gloom reports lose credibility.
         Unit commanders, supervisors, and subordinates need to have positive feedback;
         examine and report areas of satisfaction.
         12.10.6.2.2. Distinction Between Facts and Opinions. Use word phrases to clearly
         show the origin of opinions. Example: Opinions solicited from female personnel
         reflects the following.
         12.10.6.2.3. Span of Response. When stating an opinion of a particular demographic
         group, provide the span of response; this helps the unit commander grasp the
         significance of the matter under discussion.     Example: Of the 27 Caucasian
         personnel assigned, ten (37 percent) appeared to experience problems working with
         career development course materials.
         12.10.6.2.4. Use of Absolutes. Terms such as "always," "never," "best," "worst,"
         provide no room for error, and must be avoided whenever possible. When one of
         these terms must be used to provide accurate information, the source should be
         clearly specified. Example: Five members of the Propulsion Branch stated ―the
         chain of command always...‖
  12.10.7. Protection of Sensitive Data. A UCA may reveal many personal problems and
  concerns. Often interviewees will mention names and make allegations about the conduct of
  others. Use common sense and good judgment when working with this information. In
  some instances, the unit commander will need to know all of the particulars, including the
  name of the source. In other instances, the UCA team need only alert the unit commander to
  the situation. Do not misrepresent the EO office’s role to either the source or the unit
  commander.
      12.10.7.1. If interviews produce names of individuals or alleged offenders, do not
      identify these individuals by name or provide verbatim comments in any written report.
      Specific information may be provided verbally to the unit commander during the out-
      brief.
      12.10.7.2. A UCA is intended to raise and identify issues which impact the human
      relations climate and as such, does not serve as an official investigation. A UCA report is
      not a substitute for the military/civilian complaint process or any official investigation.
      The UCA team and unit commanders must not use UCA reports for these purposes.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                  117


   12.10.8. Access to Information: The UCA report is a controlled working document and
   must be marked FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (Refer to DoD 5400.7-R, DoD Freedom of
   Information Act Program). Do not include any classified material in the report.
      12.10.8.1. The UCA report belongs to the unit in which the UCA was conducted. The
      unit commander will retain the original copy of the UCA report. As the records
      custodians for UCA reports, the EO office will be responsible for ensuring both
      functional and FOIA requests are processed IAW DoD 5400.7-R. The unit commander
      will coordinate the release of the UCA report, IAW DoD 5400.7-R.
      12.10.8.2. UCA reports are subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Any
      request for release or denial of the UCA report must adhere to the requirements listed in
      DoD 5400.7-R. The Privacy Act does not apply to UCA reports.
   12.10.9. The Verbal out-brief. An out-brief is required after all UCA information has been
   analyzed, tabulated, evaluated and administratively processed. The out-brief may contain a
   synopsis of the survey analysis report, comments gathered from the surveys, relevant trend
   data and anecdotal comments made by interviewees during the interview process. For Type
   II UCA, the post-survey briefing is sufficient and serves as the out-brief.
12.11. Defense Equal Opportunity Climate Survey (DEOCS).
   12.11.1. This assessment tool is administered by DEOMI and the method includes unit trend
   analysis, survey distribution, analysis and a final written report. This option may also
   include interviews derived from the DEOCS analysis. EO offices are required to notify
   AFPC/EO when a DEOCS is requested by senior leadership.

       HUMAN RELATIONS CLIMATE ASSESSMENT SUBCOMMITTEE (HRCAS)

13.1. Purpose. The Human Relations Climate Assessment Subcommittee (HRCAS) provides
the Integrated Delivery System (IDS) with an analysis of the installation human relations climate
(HRC) semi-annually.
13.2. Goal.
   13.2.1. The goal of HRCAS is to ensure mission effectiveness by identifying and resolving
   human relations issues while strengthening the work environment for the total force.
   13.2.2. The HRCAS is part of the installation IDS under the Community Action Integration
   Board (CAIB).
   13.2.3. The HRCAS uses cross-functional collaboration to analyze trends affecting the
   installation work environment from a total force perspective, shares pertinent data, and
   makes actionable strategic/tactical recommendations to address areas of concern.
   13.2.4. The CAIB Executive Director will ensure the HRCAS is fully integrated into
   IDS/CAIB activities and the IDS chairperson facilitates collaboration between the HRCAS
   and other IDS/CAIB members to achieve a comprehensive assessment.
13.3. Roles and Responsibilities.
   13.3.1. The installation/center EO director will serve as HRCAS chairperson. At a
   minimum, the HRCAS will consist of representatives from the following offices of primary
   responsibility (OPRs):
        13.3.1.1. Equal Opportunity (EO) Office: Provides information and analysis on unit
        climate survey reports, EO military/civilian complaints (to include commander worked-
        issues, Military EO facilitations, and any contractor-related referrals), EOTIs, EO and
        non-EO-related informal assistance, Out & About visits, and any specialized training
        conducted at the request of commanders.
        13.3.1.2. Affirmative Employment Program (AEP) Managers/Special Emphasis Program
        (SEP) Managers: Provide information and analysis on AEP and SEP initiatives/activities,
        including information and analysis on the Management Directive 715), and best
        practices. A "best practice" is defined as a management idea which asserts there is a
        technique, method, process, activity, incentive or reward more effective at delivering a
        particular outcome than any other technique. It is also defined as the most efficient
        (least amount of effort) and effective (best results) way of accomplishing a task, based on
        repeatable procedures that have proven themselves over time for large numbers of
        people.
        13.3.1.3. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Manager for Workplace Disputes:
        Provides information and analysis on workplace disputes handled through the installation
        ADR program. This will include facilitation or mediation attempts/resolutions, and a
        summary of disputes handled informally through non-ADR methods such as interest-
        based negotiations.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                      119


       13.3.1.4. Civilian Personnel Section (CPS): Provides information and analysis on
       civilian personnel issues relating to labor relations, unfair labor practices, grievances,
       Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) appeals, etc.
       13.3.1.5. Inspector General (IG): Using available data provides general information on
       trends that may impact the installation human relations climate.
       13.3.1.6. Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Manager (if applicable): Provides
       information and analysis of concerns gathered from the civilian population on the
       installation and trends in requests for assistance.
       13.3.1.7. Military Personnel Element (MPE) (supporting member):                   Provides
       demographic data to the HRCAS as requested.
       13.3.1.8. Other functional OPRs who may have pertinent information to contribute to
       HRCAS activities but are permanent installation IDS/CAIB members (i.e., Chaplain,
       SARC, SJA, etc.) have not been specifically included as HRCAS members to minimize
       redundancy/overlap. However, they are considered adjunct HRCAS collaborators and
       should provide information to the HRCAS on an as-needed basis to help facilitate
       problem identification/resolution. Additional organizations may also be included based
       on local mission conditions and the desires of the CAIB/IC (i.e., FSS, PA, etc.).
13.4. Deliverables.
   13.4.1. The HRCAS will meet at least quarterly to analyze data covering the reporting
   periods of 1 October through 31 March (1st half FY) and 1 April through 30 September (2nd
   half FY).
   13.4.2. Members will provide a demographic breakdown (i.e., race, color, religion, national
   origin and sex) of noted positive or negative trends and other information of a qualitative
   nature applicable to their functional areas.
       13.4.2.1. HRCAS meetings should center on identifying mission-inhibiting climate
       factors and developing solutions to strengthen preventive and educational programs
       concerning the workplace human relations environment. Refer to the EO CoP for sample
       questions that may be used to assist OPRs in analyzing their data.
   13.4.3. The HRCAS will provide semiannual assessments to the IDS during the first and
   third quarters of the fiscal year to coincide with EO’s overall assessment of the installation’s
   HRC reporting requirements (i.e., 1st half FY data will be analyzed and briefed during the
   3rd qtr of the FY). The CAIB Executive Director, in consultation with the IDS membership
   and EO director or designee, will determine what information and recommendations from the
   HRCAS will be brought forward to the CAIB.
   13.4.4. The EO director will present HRCAS findings/recommendations to the IDS and
   ensure HRCAS members and other collaborators understand their roles and responsibilities
   in meeting the spirit and intent of HRCAS.
   13.4.5. The HRCA Matrix (employing a ―stoplight‖ format) will be used to provide the
   CAIB with an assessment of each major functional area.
 120                                                            AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010


       13.4.5.1. The HRCA Matrix rating system is as follows:
          13.4.5.1.1. Green – No unusual leadership concerns; Yellow – Requires focused
          leadership attention; Red – Critical, requires aggressive intervention. Note: This
          rating scale is not intended as a measure of performance or ―report card‖ on the
          effectiveness of functional OPRs. Rather, it reflects the status of HRC elements and
          identifies items of interest emanating from within those areas installation-wide.
       13.4.5.2. HRCA matrix ratings will be derived by consensus based on HRCAS and IDS
       analysis/discussion of quantitative and qualitative data as provided by subcommittee
       members. Recommendations will be developed to address areas rated ―Yellow‖ or
       ―Red.‖ This may include new action items or follow-up on those already underway.
       13.4.5.3. The HRCA matrix will include, at a minimum, ratings from the current and
       previous two reporting periods. However, local conditions may dictate that additional
       reporting periods be included. For instance, AEF rotation cycles, mission changes,
       transformation/restructuring activities, or significant negative trends may drive a need for
       long-term monitoring.
   13.4.6. The HRCAS will brief the IDS using a slide presentation format. At a minimum, it
   will include the following elements:
       13.4.6.1. HRCAS membership.
       13.4.6.2. Installation/center demographic breakdown.
       13.4.6.3. HRCA matrix (additional factors falling outside basic matrix parameters may
       be added as deemed appropriate).
       13.4.6.4. Significant Issues.
       13.4.6.5. Recommendations.
       13.4.6.6. Supplemental information/data supporting how matrix ratings of ―Yellow‖ or
       ―Red‖ were determined (i.e., UCA data, DEOCS results, etc.). It may also include
       significant positive trends or indicators.
13.5. Reporting Requirements.
   13.5.1. On a semiannual basis, the EO director will brief the HRCAS matrix to the CAIB
   and discuss the status of key areas including those possible areas of concern requiring a
   leadership decision and POC tasking/follow up.
   13.5.2. The IDS and EO director, based on recommendations from the HRCAS, will
   determine which matrix factors require further analysis or corrective action and will identify
   the functional OPR(s) responsible for action plan implementation and follow-up.
   13.5.3. Addressing significant HRC anomalies or mission inhibiting conditions may require
   a collective effort on the part of the IDS and HRCAS.
       13.5.3.1. The installation CAIB will determine what HRCAS issues, if any, need to be
       elevated to the MAJCOM CAIB. The MAJCOM CAIBs will, in turn, determine issues to
       be elevated to the Air Force CAIB.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                              121


  13.5.4. The EO director will provide an overall summary of the HRC (using the HRCAS
  matrix ―stoplight‖ format) semi-annually on the AF Form 3018.
  13.5.5. The EO director will annotate the October through March HRCAS results in the
  April through June quarterly report, and the April through September HRCAS results in the
  October through December quarterly report. This will allow enough time for the HRCAS to
  meet and provide a HRCAS to the installation IDS/CAIB. The summary will include
  significant trends or issues and corrective measures as approved by the CAIB/IDS.
  13.5.6. Center-level EO directors will ensure the semi-annual HRCAS findings are
  coordinated with their respective center commanders (directors) prior to vetting the
  information through the installation CAIB. This approach gives the center commander
  (director) an opportunity to provide feedback, if appropriate.
 122                                                          AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010

                       HUMAN RELATIONS EDUCATION (HRE)

14.1. Resources and Materials.
   14.1.1. The films and videos shown by the EO office must be approved for use in standard
   Air Force EO/HRE lesson plans. DEOMI maintains a listing of approved films. (Reference
   DEOMI.org for listing of films/videos).
   14.1.2. The EO office may also show films and videos that support locally developed
   EO/HRE lesson plan objectives. The EO director and the installation/center commander
   (director) must approve films and videos used.
14.2. HRE Responsibilities.
   14.2.1. HQ AFPC/EO develops, reviews and updates all Air Force-level EO HRE lesson
   plans, objectives, materials and programs. All lesson plans and materials must emphasize
   equal opportunity as a mission imperative and legal obligation. When appropriate to the
   course, diversity should also be emphasized as a mission imperative.
   14.2.2. Only DEOMI-trained EO directors/specialists will conduct HRE education to meet
   the requirements listed in table 14.1, rules 5 through 8.
   14.2.3. EO HRE instructors must:
       14.2.3.1. Develop and maintain personalized lesson plans tailored to the Air Force, the
       installation/center’s EO objectives and the importance of equal opportunity and diversity

       and keep on file within the EO office.
   14.2.5. The installation/center commander (director) will approve all locally developed
   programs, to include lesson plans and any film or video used, before implementation.
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                         123


        14.2.6. The MPS will schedule military personnel requiring EO training as part of in-
        processing. The EO office will provide the INTRO monitor with class dates, times and class
        locations. The EO office will schedule all other training requirements directly with the units
        or other organizations.
        14.2.7. The CPS will schedule civilian personnel for HRE. The EO office will provide the
        CPS with class dates, times, location and number of available slots. At the conclusion of
        each class, the EO office will forward the civilian attendance roster to the CPS with the
        names of civilian attendees for the purpose of updating civilian personnel training records.
        The CPS and employee’s unit will manage civilian employee no-shows.

8. All PME schools must include lesson blocks on the importance of diversity as a
foundation of effective leadership. Developing leadership at all levels that can build and
lead inclusive teams is paramount to achieving mission excellence. PME instructors are
authorized to teach the HRE blocks at the Airman Leadership School, NCO and Senior
NCO Academies when they use seminar/guided discussion as the method of instruction.
The EO office will instruct when the mode of instruction is formal/informal lecture. At
installations where the PME staff uses seminar/guided discussion, the EO office will
provide the PME staff with materials regarding contemporary EO issues and keep them
abreast of any EO policy changes.

                            EQUAL OPPORTUNITY OUTREACH

15.1. The Out and About Program.
   15.1.1. The Out and About Program is a process used to gather additional EO/human
   relations information that may impact installation personnel.
   15.1.2. It is the EO director’s responsibility to schedule an out and about assessment with the
   unit commander, staff agency chief, or first sergeant. The EO director will ensure unit
   leadership receives a summary of observations following the assessment. Off-base out and
   about assessments should first be approved by the installation/center commander (director)
   prior to conducting visit.
   15.1.3. Document all out and about assessments on AF Form 1271. The EO office will file
   the completed AF Form 1271 in the unit continuity folder. The EO office should not conduct
   an out and about assessment to the same unit/location within a 6-month period unless
   requested by unit leadership. Observations and discussions will focus on EO, human
   relations and organizational effectiveness factors that impact morale and mission readiness to
   include, but are not limited to:
      15.1.3.1. Interpersonal communication/interaction/polarization (break rooms, work
      areas, recreation/entertainment facilities, etc.).
      15.1.3.2. Accessibility to unit leadership.
      15.1.3.3. Bulletin board and public display items (individual/group recognition, policy
      letters/posters, etc.).
      15.1.3.4. Workplace conditions/environment.
      15.1.3.5. Dormitory conditions/environment.
      15.1.3.6. Graffiti.
      15.1.3.7. Personal display of pictures, posters, artifacts, etc.
      15.1.3.8. General impressions.
   15.1.4. Such evaluations shall be performed on no less than three of the above effectiveness
   factors.
   15.1.5. Information gathered during the out and about assessment should be used as part of
   the overall Unit Climate Assessment Program.
   15.1.6. The number of Out and About visits each EO office must conduct is based on the
   number of EO specialists assigned. Each EO specialist is required to conduct at least 1 Out
   and About per quarter. Example: If the EO office has 5 EO specialist assigned, a minimum
   of 5 Out and About visits must be conducted during the quarter. (See Out & About checklist
   on the EO CoP for examples on how to complete an Out & About assessment).

15.2. Consulting. In order to assure maximum EO program effectiveness, the EO director
should consult with external agencies as appropriate. Consulting with external agencies (e.g.
EEOC, Federal Executive Board, etc.,) provides resources not organically available to the EO
director and also provides opportunities to expand the EO program’s effectiveness.
15.3. Collaboration. The EO Office is an integral part of the installation’s human relations
climate. As such, EO directors are responsible for ensuring maximum use of AF helping
agencies. These agencies include, but are not limited to SJA, HRO, CPS, Airman and Family
Readiness Center, Health and Wellness Center, Mental Health, Chaplain, Base Medical Facility,
Employee Assistance Program, Public Affairs, SARC, Security Forces, AFOSI, etc.
15.4. Ethnic/Special Observances. Ethnic/special observances are conducted to enhance cross-
cultural awareness and to promote diversity among all military members, civilian employees,
family members, and retirees. These observances recognize the achievements and contributions
made by members of specific racial, religious, ethnic, and gender groups in our society; as well
as, promoting mutual respect, understanding, teamwork, harmony, pride and esprit de corps
among all groups. Participation in special/ethnic observance programs combat stereotypical
behaviors and benefit our diverse workplace. Additionally, these activities are an extension of
human relations education objectives for maintaining a healthy human relations climate. Active
command support and leadership along with thorough planning are key fundamentals for success
of the program. Note: Diversity Days will not take the place of those special observance
months mandated/proclaimed by the President of the United States.
   15.4.1. EO offices are not responsible for program management or event planning. EO
   offices will serve as subject matter experts working in conjunction with special observance
   committees in planning installation/center observance activities. Participation in these events
   provide an opportunity for members to exchange ideas and share experiences that lead to
   increased awareness an appreciation of our diverse cultures, rich heritage and contributions.
   15.4.2. The observance focus should be directed toward encouraging interaction and not
   solely on recognition. Success of observances is determined by the level of diverse
   participation across the installation/center.
   15.4.3. Budgetary restrictions must be considered when planning events. The observance
   chairperson must comply with the budgetary constraints contained in AFI 65-601, Volume I,
   Section K. 4.26.1. Depending on the scope of the observance and the extravagance of events,
   it may be necessary to organize fund-raisers to help support financial requirements. There
   are AFI and Joint Ethic (JER) regulations that place limitations on fund-raising. All
   budgetary requirements must be coordinated with and approved by the servicing SJA prior to
   submission to your financial management office.
   15.4.4. Installation/Center Commander (Director). Senior installation leadership is the key
   to a success special/ethnic observance program.
       15.4.4.1. The installation/center commander (director) ensures           committees are
       established to develop awareness programs for each observance.
       15.4.4.2. In the event that an ethnic/special observance committee is not in place, the
       installation/center commander (director) may appoint a voluntary working group made up
       of military members and civilian employees to plan relevant activities for an observance.
       The group composition may include designated special-emphasis program managers,

     chairpersons of chartered ethnic heritage clubs/committees and representatives from staff
     agencies that normally participate in the planning process.
     15.4.4.3. The installation/center commander (director) or designee must approve
     administrative execution of special/ethnic observance programs. Adequate funding for
     observance events is an essential element in the success or failure of the programs.

  ensures ethnic/special observance chairpersons coordinate all packages and requests through
  the EO office prior to installation/center commander (director) approval.
     15.4.5.1. The EO director will ensure the EO office maintains a copy of continuity
     folders for each ethnic/special observance committee. The purpose is to provide
     information for future observances (e.g., copies of calendar of events, flyers, staff
     summary sheet, programs, etc).
  15.4.6. EO Specialist. The EO specialist will maintain close liaison with ethnic/special
  observance groups and serve as an advisor to each committee. Advisory duties include:

Terms
Administrative Judge (AJ)— For the purpose of this instruction and pursuant to 29 C.F.R. §
1614.109, an AJ is an individual appointed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
when a hearing is requested, who assumes full responsibility for the adjudication of the
complaint--including oversight of the development of the record.
Affirmative Action— Authorized methods used to achieve the objectives of the MEO program.
Processes, activities and systems designed to prevent, identify and eliminate unlawful
discriminatory treatment as it affects the recruitment, training, assignment, utilization, promotion
and retention of military personnel.
Affirmative Employment Program (AEP)— Each Federal agency is required to maintain a
continuing affirmative program to promote equal opportunity and to identify and eliminate
discriminatory practices and policies. 29 CFR § 1614.102 EEOC MD-715 requires agencies to
take proactive steps to ensure equal employment opportunity for all their employees and
applicants for employment by regularly evaluating their employment practices to identify and
eliminate barriers that hamper the advancement of any individual on the basis of race, national
origin, sex or disability.
Agency— Each authority of the Government of the United States, whether or not it is within or
subject to review by another agency, but does not include -- (A) the Congress; (B) the courts of
the United States; (C) the governments of the territories or possessions of the United States; (D)
the government of the District of Columbia.
Aggrieved Person— For the purpose of this instruction, this refers to an employee, former
employee, or applicant for employment who believes he or she has been discriminated against on
the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or reprisal.
Air Force Civilian Appellate Review Office (AFCARO)— A subordinate to SAF/MRB and is
also identified as SAF/MRBA. AFCARO analyzes formal complaints, and prepares final
decisions and final orders for review and SAF/MRB signature. AFCARO coordinates with the
Air Force Central Labor Law Office on appeals and requests for reconsideration being processed
between the Air Force and the EEOC and acts as an Air Force liaison with EEOC and the
Department of Defense, Civilian Personnel Management Services, Investigations and
Resolutions Division (IRD).
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)— The Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996,
Public Law (PL) No. 104-320, 110 Stat. 3870, 5 U.S.C. § 571, et seq. (1996) defines ADR as any
procedure that is used to resolve issues in controversy, including but not limited to facilitation,
mediation, fact-finding, mini-trials, arbitration and the use of ombudsmen, or any combination
thereof. Sec. 4(b), 5 U.S.C. § 571(3). [AFPD 51-12, Alternative Dispute Resolution (9 January
03), Attachment 1; AFI 51-1201, Alternative Dispute Resolution Processes in Workplace
Disputes (21 May 2009), Attachment 1]. In workplace disputes, ADR proceedings utilize the
services of a neutral third party to assist the parties in resolving their dispute. Specific ADR
procedures are as follows:
AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010                                                                       139


    -Facilitation-—An unstructured and flexible process in which the parties are assisted in
    resolving issues in controversy by a trained third party neutral (not necessarily a mediator)
    utilizing interest-based negotiation techniques.
    -Fact-finding/Early Neutral Evaluation-A structured process in which the parties seek the
    assistance of a subject matter expert to review the dispute and to provide an assessment of
    the likely outcome of the dispute based on the facts as found or as agreed by the parties.
    -Mediation- A structured process in which the parties seek the assistance of a qualified
    mediator to help them in resolving their issue in controversy. The Primary attributes of
    mediation are a structured process, the use of interest-based negotiation techniques, and the
    use of separate and confidential caucuses between each party and the mediator.
    -Ombudsmen -A neutral employee appointed to receive and investigate complaints, provide
    guidance, answer questions, and refer inquiries and complaints to appropriate outside
    resources. In the Air Force, an ombudsman must be officially appointed in writing by the
    base, Field Operating Agency (FOA), or Direct Reporting Unit (DRU).
    Other ADR- Other forms of ADR not specifically identified in the ADRA include
    structured negotiation employing interest-based negotiation principles, peer review panels,
    which are panels consisting of employees, or a combination of employees and management
    officials, appointed to review the facts, hear arguments, and render decisions on issues in
    controversy. Alternatively, an organization may employ a technique that is considered part
    of another agency's ADR program, such as the FLRA or EEOC. In addition, a dispute may
    be resolved by the use of a Federal court's ADR program.
Alternative Dispute Resolution Attempt— An ADR attempt occurs when a neutral is
appointed and specified parties participate in a dispute resolution proceeding using one or more
ADR procedures. Simply informing the parties about the option of ADR does not count as an
attempt.
Alternative Dispute Resolution Manager for Workplace Disputes— An individual appointed
at the Headquarters Air Force, MAJCOM, and installation level to promote the use of ADR
processes for resolving military and civilian workplace disputes, to facilitate the development
and implementation of the organization’s workplace disputes ADR plan, and to provide
oversight of the organization’s workplace disputes ADR program. ADR Manager should be a
civilian employee in the grade of GS-12 or above (or pay band equivalent), and must be regarded
as fair and impartial to all stakeholders in ADR. If no qualified civilian candidates are available,
the commander may assign a field-grade commissioned officer or senior NCO to serve as the
ADR Manager until a qualified civilian employee is available. The commander shall solicit and
consider recommendations from representatives of labor unions with exclusive bargaining rights
before appointing the ADR Manager.
Alternative Dispute Resolution Stakeholder— An organization or individual with an official
or, in the case of a complainant, claimant or grievant, a personal interest in the initiation,
processing, and resolution of one or more workplace disputes. Commanders, supervisors,
individual employees, military members, dispute program owners (e.g., CPS and EO) and legal
and other advisors are all ADR stakeholders.
 140                                                           AFI36-2706 5 OCTOBER 2010

Arbitration— Arbitration involves the parties’ mutual selection of a neutral third party, an
arbitrator, to decide the issue in controversy after hearing witnesses, considering other items of
evidence, and listening to the arguments of each side. The arbitrator’s decision, called an award,
can be binding or nonbinding, depending on the parties’ agreement, but Air Force policy
generally precludes binding arbitration outside of the collective bargaining context. Although
commonly considered an ADR process, arbitration is not favored as an alternative process for
resolving Air Force workplace disputes because of its use as the final step of negotiated
grievance procedures in Air Force collective bargaining agreements.

or the Indian subcontinents including, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan,

challenged; i.e., race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability and/or reprisal for
opposing any practice made unlawful, or for participating in any stage of the complaint process
under those statutes.
Black or African American— A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of

that meet the definition of disability. For example, a woman who carries the genetic marker

GINA.
