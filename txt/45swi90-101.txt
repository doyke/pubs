     and any supporting documentation to the 45th Mission Support Group Command Section at
     least 21 days prior to the activity or event. All documented organizational concerns/conflicts

     the names of its representative(s) who will be soliciting to the 45 SW Form 400.
     2.2. When completing a 45 SW Form 400, if the proposed activity will involve solicitation,
     the applicant should indicate whether the solicitation will involve passive in-person
     solicitation or active in-person solicitation.
        2.2.1. Passive in-person solicitation means that the solicitor does not initiate personal
        individual contact. Examples of passive in-person include: ringing a bell beside a
        collection bucket, responding to individuals who walk up to a table set up to sell baked
        goods and calling out “get fresh baked goods here” from behind a table when the speech
        is not directed at a particular individual.
        2.2.2. Active in-person solicitation involves initiating personal contact. Examples of
        active in-person solicitation include asking an individual person if they want to buy a box
        of cookies as they walk in the BX, handing out flyers to everyone who walks by or
        walking up to persons to solicit donations. In-person solicitation should never impede
        persons from entering or using base facilities.
     2.3. The solicitor must be duly licensed under applicable Federal, state, county and
     municipal laws and codes.
     2.4. No individual or non-federal entity may provide educational programs or materials on

     training provided by base-affiliated banks and credit unions or tax-exempt organizations
     under I.R.C Sec 501(c)(3) that have SAF/MR approval. At no time shall representatives
     recommend specific commercial insurance, loan or investment products.

   Minimis”, a 45 SW Form 400 must be submitted.
   2.10. Official military ID cards or access badges shall not be used to gain access to the
   installation for the purposes of solicitation in lieu of obtaining a properly coordinated and
   approved 45 SW Form 400.
3. Requests for Private Organization (PO) On-Base Fundraising Events.
