                                  GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Responsibilities. This instruction prescribes procedures for operating F-16 aircraft under
most circumstances. It is not a substitute for sound judgment. Procedures not specifically
addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe and effective mission accomplishment.
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   7


                                           Chapter 2

                                    MISSION PLANNING

Section 2A—-General

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning is shared jointly by all flight
members and the operations and intelligence functions of fighter organizations. Accomplish
sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission execution, to include fuel requirements, map
preparation, and takeoff/landing data. (T-1).
2.2. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. Bird Watch Conditions are
defined in AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and AFPAM 91-212,
Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques. The OG/CC will
determine local BASH procedures. (T-1).
   2.2.1. Takeoffs, landings, or low-levels within one hour of either sunrise or sunset during the
   phase II period increase likelihood of birdstrike. Significant bird hazards are published in
   FLIP GP, the IFR Supplement and local airfield guidance.
   2.2.2. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, pilots will make
   appropriate decisions based on observable bird conditions and seek assistance from local
   airfield personnel. (T-1).
   2.2.3. Pilots will consider bird migratory patterns during enroute portion of the mission to
   minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on
   United States Avian Hazard Advisory System (http://www.usahas.com) provides BASH
   information, including regionalized CONUS bird migration, PFPS software overlay, and
   latest news. See AFPAM 91-212 for additional information. (T-1).
2.3. Standards. The OG/CC may publish and approve group or wing standards. Operations
Group Stan/Eval (OGV) will review all standards for AFI 11-series compliance prior to
publication. (T-1).
2.4. CBRNE. Procedures for operation in a CBRNE-threat environment are contained in
Attachment 2.
2.5. Flight Material Preparation.
   2.5.1. Mission Data Card (MDC). The minimum TOLD requirements on the MDC are:
   2,000 foot acceleration check speed (if computed takeoff roll exceeds 2,500 feet); refusal
   speed (dry/wet); rotation speed; takeoff speed; takeoff distance; normal landing speed and
   distance (dry/wet); heavyweight (immediately after takeoff) landing speed and distance
   (dry/wet). If computed takeoff roll is less than 2,500 feet, evaluate aircraft performance by
   comparing actual takeoff distance to computed takeoff distance or use a 1000 foot
   acceleration check speed. (T-1).
   2.5.2. Local Area Maps. A local area map is not required if pilot aids include jettison areas,
   divert information, controlled bailout areas, and provide sufficient detail of the local area to
   remain within assigned training areas. (T-1).
 8                                                        AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013


     2.5.3. Enroute Charts. Pilots may substitute FLIP enroute charts for maps on navigational
     flights within areas adequately covered by these charts.
     2.5.4. Low Altitude Maps.
        2.5.4.1. On low altitude flights, each pilot will carry a current map (updated using Chart
        Update Manual or electronic equivalent) of the route/operating area. It will be of such
        scale and quality that the detail of terrain features, hazards, and chart annotations permits
        navigation and safe mission accomplishment. Circle/highlight manmade obstacles at
        above planned flight altitude within 5nm of the planned route. Annotate time or distance
        tick marks and headings. (T-1).
        2.5.4.2. Annotate route abort altitude (RAA) using the IFR Off Airways guidance in AFI
        11-202V3 chapter 8. (T-1).
        2.5.4.3. For flights inside the Continental United states (CONUS) under Visual Flight
        Rules (VFR) or inside Military Training Routes (MTR), comply with the following:
            2.5.4.3.1. Use FLIP AP/1B and either sectional aeronautical charts or mission
            planning software (e.g. PFPS/Falcon View/JMPS). Select the following overlay
            options for PFPS/Falcon View: airports/heliports, airspace boundaries, airways,
            MTR, parachute jump and special use airspace boundaries. (T-1).
            2.5.4.3.2. Annotate Low level charts, or locally developed low-level route books ,
            with location and dimensions of class B/C/D airspace, military airfields, civil
            airfields, and other potential high density traffic areas (e.g., parachute activity areas
            and ultra light/hang glider/glider sites) within 5 NM of any planned VFR route or
            MTR lateral boundary. Annotate airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity
            of class B/C/D airspace as well as the intersection of other VR/IR routes or other
            areas of conflict. (T-1).
        2.5.4.4. Outside the CONUS, follow gaining MAJCOM, theater, or host nation guidance
        on mission planning. If no such guidance exists, use the best charts or flight planning
        software overlay options available to accomplish the intent of maximizing traffic
        awareness and awareness of controlled airspace boundaries. (T-1).
     2.5.5. Digital Terrain System (DTS) and Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System
     (AGCAS). F-16 mission planners will ensure RDTED coverage is adequate for the mission
     area and is loaded to each flight member’s ADTC to ensure maximum AGCAS protection.
     Without appropriate RDTED coverage, or when corrupted data is present, AGCAS will still
     provide recovery protection to 50 feet MSL, however this may not prevent potential ground
     collision when MSL elevation is higher. (T-1).
     2.5.6. All qualified crewmembers will carry current checklists on every flight. (T-1).
2.6. Fuel Conservation. Manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious
resource. Design procedures for optimal fuel use and efficiencies throughout all phases of
mission execution, to include ground operations, flight plans, power settings and climb/descent
profiles. Incorporate enroute tasks to make maximum use of airborne learning opportunities. (T-
1).
2.7. Overwater. Planned flights over water, outside of the local training area (e.g.,
deployments, cross countries, Programmed Delivery for Maintenance (PDM) inputs, etc) will be
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                 9


accomplished two-ship as a minimum. (T-1). Single ship over water flights, outside of the local
training area, require OG/CC approval. (T-3). For deployments under ACC/AOS movement
control, AFI 11-207 waiver authorities will apply.
2.8. Briefing and Debriefing.
   2.8.1. All flight members will attend the briefing unless previously coordinated with
   unit/squadron supervisors. Flight leads are responsible for presenting a logical briefing to
   promote a safe and effective mission. Structure flight briefings to accommodate the
   capabilities of each pilot in the flight. Any item published in CAF/wing/group/squadron
   standards or AFIs and understood by all participants may be briefed as "standard." (T-1).
   2.8.2. Flight leads must plan adequate time to discuss required briefing items depending on
   complexity of the mission and pilot capabilities, and must start flight briefings at least 1.5
   hours before scheduled takeoff. Alert briefings will start in sufficient time to be completed
   prior to pilot changeover. Items may be briefed in any sequence, provided all minimum
   requirements listed in this AFI and AFI 11-202V3 are addressed. Additional time and CRM
   emphasis is required in D-model sorties especially on FAM and Incentive flights. Passenger
   must demonstrate oxygen regulator use, ability to establish multiple airways and mask
   removal after being strapped in. (T-1). Reference Attachment 3 for example briefing
   guides. All flight briefings will include:
       2.8.2.1. Weather and NOTAMs (T-1).
       2.8.2.2. Emergency procedures (T-1).
       2.8.2.3. Mission priorities and task management. (T-1).
       2.8.2.4. Significant rules (e.g. SPINS, Training Rules, ROE). (T-1).
       2.8.2.5. Flight member responsibilities and deconfliction contracts. Flight leads will
       brief a formation deconfliction/blind/get well plan for every phase of flight. (T-1).
   2.8.3. Low-level Briefings will emphasize (T-1):
       2.8.3.1. Obstacle/terrain acquisition and avoidance, bird hazards, emergency actions and
       weather avoidance with route abort procedures. (T-1).
       2.8.3.2. Employment of all Collision Avoidance Advisories and Digital Terrain System
       warnings to include AGCAS. (T-1).
       2.8.3.3. Human factors to include task prioritization, g-excess illusion, and perceptual
       issues associated with flight over water/featureless terrain. (T-1).
       2.8.3.4. Airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity of class B/C/D airspace as
       well as the intersection of other VR/IR routes or other areas of conflict. (T-1).
   2.8.4. Dissimilar Formation Briefing. Emphasize proper position to ensure wingtip
   clearance, flight member responsibilities, and aircraft-unique requirements for each phase of
   flight. (T-1).
   2.8.5. Alternate Mission/Events and Multiple Go Days. (T-1).
       2.8.5.1. Brief an alternate mission for each flight that is less complex than the primary
       mission. Unbriefed missions/events will not be flown. Mission elements may be
 10                                                     AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013


      modified and briefed airborne as long as flight safety is not compromised. Flight leads
      will ensure changes are acknowledged by all flight members. Continuation training (CT)
      missions may fly primary or alternate missions in any sequence. (T-1).
      2.8.5.2. During deployed operations, exercises, or multiple-go days when aircraft turn
      times do not allow follow-on mission brief(s), if all flight members attend an initial flight
      brief, the flight lead need only brief any changes for subsequent flights. (T-1).
      2.8.5.3. On multiple-go days, subsequent missions will be of equal or less complexity.
      Schedule and plan upgrade events on the first sortie only. If that sortie is non-effective
      for weather, maintenance or airspace, IPs may elect to accomplish the planned upgrade
      events in the second sortie. (T-1).
   2.8.6. Debriefing.
      2.8.6.1. All missions will be debriefed and address in-flight execution, flight member
      responsibilities, deconfliction contracts, tactical employment priorities, and sensor
      management. (T-1).
      2.8.6.2. Flight leads will review the video/audio record of all tactical portions of the
      sortie to assess flight members’ AGSM effectiveness. (T-1). It is imperative to evaluate
      not only during the G-ex, but also after the pilot has had time to fatigue--typically when
      the AGSM breaks down and G-induced Loss of Consciousness (GLOC) occurs. Pilots
      with poor AGSM technique or low G-tolerance will be identified to the operations
      officer. (T-1). The squadron commander has the option of directing refresher centrifuge
      training in accordance with AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew.
2.9. Unit Developed Checklists/Local Pilot Aids. Unit developed checklists used in lieu of
flight manual checklists must contain all items, verbatim and in order, unless specifically
addressed in the flight manual. (T-1). Pilot aids will contain:
   2.9.1. Briefing guides (reference Attachment 3 for examples). (T-1).
   2.9.2. Local radio channelization. (T-1).
   2.9.3. Appropriate airfield diagrams, to include cable/net barrier information. (T-1).
   2.9.4. Emergency information (impoundment procedures, emergency action checklists,
   NORDO procedures, divert information, search and rescue procedures, etc). (T-1).
   2.9.5. Divert base cable and barrier information. (T-1).
   2.9.6. Bailout and jettison areas. (T-1).
   2.9.7. Cross-country procedures to include: command and control, engine documentation,
   Joint Oil Analysis Program (JOAP) samples, and aircraft servicing. (T-1).
   2.9.8. Other information as desired such as: stereo flight plans, turn procedures, local
   training areas, instrument preflight, and alert setup procedures.

Section 2B—-Night (see also night of Chapter 3, Chapter 5 and Chapter 6

2.10. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). Compute the MSA for each leg of the intended route of
flight in accordance with AFI 11-214. (T-1).
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                       11


2.11. Night chart requirements. Minimum requirement is a Form 70 or chart/map containing
headings, RAAs, MSAs, and maximum/minimum route structure altitudes. (T-1).

                          NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

Section 3A—-Ground Operations

3.1. Preflight.
   3.1.1. [B/D model aircraft] when the rear cockpit is occupied by other than a fully qualified
   F-16 pilot, place the stick control switch in the FWD position. (T-1).
   3.1.2. Do not carry baggage/equipment in an unoccupied rear cockpit; in the avionics bay
   behind the cockpit; or in the aft canopy fixed transparency area (turtle back). (T-1).
   3.1.3. Do not place objects in or on top of the engine intake. (T-1).
   3.1.4. Secure publications, maps and personal items to avoid flight control/ throttle
   interference. (T-1).
   3.1.5. Select Pressure Breathing (PBG) except when using Aircrew Eye and Respiratory
   Protection System (AERPS) or Aircrew Chemical Defense Equipment (ACDE). (T-1).
   3.1.6. If flying with the COMBAT EDGE vest, remove the port plug on the CRU-94/120 (if
   installed), stow the plug during flight to prevent a FOD hazard, then re-install upon
   completion of the sortie. (T-1).
   3.1.7. Ensure ejection seat survival kit deployment switch is in the automatic position. (T-1).
   3.1.8. Do not select CAT I on the Stores Configuration Switch with Category III
   configurations IAW T.O. 1F-16-1-2. (T-1).
3.2. Ground Visual Signals. Normally, pilot and ground crew will communicate by the
intercom system during all start-engine, pre-taxi and end of runway (EOR) checks. Use the
intercom system to the maximum extent possible anytime maintenance technicians are
performing "redballs" on the aircraft and for EPU checks performed in congested areas. (T-1).
Do not actuate any system which endangers ground crew prior to receiving acknowledgment.
Units with an active air defense commitment may waive use of ground intercom during alert
scrambles. (T-1). When ground intercom is not used, visual signals will be in accordance with
AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground, and this volume. (T-1). The
crew chief will repeat the given signal when it is safe to operate the system. (T-1).
   3.2.1. The following signals augment AFI 11-218:
       3.2.1.1. EPU OPERATIONAL CHECK. Raise two fingers and rotate hand. (T-1).
       3.2.1.2. FLIGHT CONTROLS CLEAR. Raise arm, clench fist, and make a stirring
       motion. (T-1).
       3.2.1.3. BRAKE CHECK. Hold left or right arm horizontal, open hand and push
       forward, breaking at the wrist (as in applying rudder pedal pressure with feet). (T-1).
       3.2.1.4. LOSS OF BRAKES WHILE TAXIING. Lower tailhook. (T-1).
       3.2.1.5. GUN ARMAMENT CHECK. Point index finger forward with thumb upward
       simulating a pistol and shake head (yes or no). (T-1).
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                13


       3.2.1.6. EPU ACTIVATION. Raise hand with palm open and perform shoving motion
       indicating "stay away." Then cup hands over oxygen mask indicating hydrazine vapors
       may be present. (T-1).
3.3. Taxi and Arming.
   3.3.1. Taxi Interval/Speed. Minimum taxi interval is 150 feet staggered or 300 feet in trail.
   Spacing may be reduced when holding short of or entering the runway. Unless mission
   requirements dictate, limit taxi speed to 30 knots, 15 knots over a raised cable, and 10 knots
   in turns. (T-1).
   3.3.2. Ice/Snow Conditions. Do not taxi during ice and/or snow conditions until all portions
   of the taxi route and runway have been checked for safe conditions. (T-1). When ice and/or
   snow are present on the taxiway, taxi on the centerline with a minimum of 300 feet spacing.
   (T-1). Minimum RCR for taxi is 10. (T-3).
   3.3.3. Ice FOD Procedures. The following procedures apply when the conditions in T.O.
   1F-16-1 indicate engine damage due to icing is possible.
       3.3.3.1. If conditions warrant, the Supervisor of Flying (SOF)/Top 3 will have the first
       flight lead start 5 minutes early to check for inlet ice formation. (T-1).
       3.3.3.2. Position ANTI ICE switch to ON prior to engine start. (T-1).
       3.3.3.3. An ice FOD monitor must be available to monitor the engine inlet for ice
       buildup whenever the aircraft is stopped for an extended period of time (i.e. ramp/shelter
       and EOR). (T-1). Avoid standing water and snow/slush accumulations.
       3.3.3.4. Hold in the arming spot with an ice FOD monitor present until cleared for take-
       off. (T-1).
       3.3.3.5. Shutdown immediately if icing is visually detected and notify the SOF/Top 3.
       (T-1). Make an appropriate entry in the aircraft forms and qualified personnel must
       accomplish an intake inspection prior to restarting the engine. (T-1).
   3.3.4. EPU Check. Do not allow maintenance technicians to approach the aircraft until the
   EPU check is complete. (T-1). Use intercom or a "thumbs up" signal to indicate when safe.
   (T-1).
3.4. EOR Inspections and Before Takeoff Checks. Place hands in view of ground personnel
while the quick check inspection and/or arming/de-arming are in progress. (T-1). If the intercom
system is not used during EOR checks, the pilot will establish and maintain visual contact with
the chief and use visual signals. (T-1). EOR inspections will be accomplished immediately
prior to takeoff at a designated location, usually near the end of the runway or while departing
the chock area (not required for alert scrambles). (T-1). At non-USAF bases, make every
attempt to coordinate an EOR inspection with the host maintenance unit. (T-1).
   3.4.1. Forward Firing Ordnance. Do not taxi in front of aircraft being armed/de-armed with
   forward firing ordnance. (T-1).
   3.4.2. Flight members will inspect each other for proper configuration and any
   abnormalities. (T-1).
 14                                                     AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013


3.5. Flight Lineup. Consider weather conditions, runway conditions, and runway width.
Minimum spacing between separated elements/flights is 500 feet. (T-1). Wingmen must
maintain wingtip clearance with their element lead. (T-1). If runway width permits, lineup with
wingtip clearance between all aircraft in the flight. (T-1).

Section 3B—-Takeoff and Departure

3.6. Takeoff.
   3.6.1. Do not takeoff when the RCR is less than 10. (T-1).
   3.6.2. Pilots will review takeoff data with emphasis on takeoff and abort factors such as
   short/wet runway, heavy gross weights, cable configurations and abort sequence in formation
   flights. (T-1).
   3.6.3. On training missions, do not takeoff if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80 percent of
   the available runway single ship or 70 percent for a formation takeoff. (T-1).
   3.6.4. Ensure a compatible departure end cable is raised for all takeoffs and landings
   (including remotely operated cables). (T-3).
   3.6.5. OG/CC may approve intersection takeoffs if operational requirements dictate. (T-3).
   3.6.6. Make an afterburner takeoff anytime the computed MIL power takeoff roll exceeds 50
   percent of the available runway. (T-1).
   3.6.7. Centerline Stores. Start the takeoff roll beyond a raised approach end cable unless
   runway length, runway conditions (wet/icy), winds, gross weight or cable availability dictate
   otherwise. (T-1). Exception: aircraft with a centerline fuel tank may takeoff across approach
   end BAK-12 arrestment cables with an 8-point tie down system.
   3.6.8. Minimum takeoff interval between aircraft/elements is 10 seconds (15 seconds for
   afterburner). (T-1). Increase interval to 20 seconds minimum for join-up on top or when
   carrying live air-to-surface ordnance (excluding BDU-33s and 20mm ammunition). (T-1).
   3.6.9. After releasing brakes, aircraft/elements will steer toward the center of the runway.
   (T-1).
   3.6.10. Formation Takeoff.
       3.6.10.1. Formation takeoffs are restricted to two aircraft. (T-1).
       3.6.10.2. Do not make formation takeoffs when:
          3.6.10.2.1. Runway width is less than 125 feet. (T-1).
          3.6.10.2.2. Standing water, ice, slush or snow is on the runway. (T-1).
          3.6.10.2.3. The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots. (T-1).
          3.6.10.2.4. Loaded with live munitions (excluding air-to-air missiles, BDU-33s,
          20mm ammunition, 2.75 rockets, AGM-88, AGM-65, and night illumination flares).
          (T-1).
          3.6.10.2.5. Ferrying aircraft from contractor/AFMC facilities. (T-1).
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                 15


          3.6.10.2.6. Asymmetric loading or a difference of more than 2,500 pounds gross
          weight. (T-1).
3.7. Initial Join-up and Rejoins.
   3.7.1. Day weather minimums for VFR join-ups below a ceiling are 1,500 foot ceiling and 3
   miles (5 km) visibility. (T-1).
   3.7.2. Flight leads will maintain 350 KIAS until join-up is accomplished unless mission
   requirements necessitate a different airspeed. (T-1). Pilots may delay AB cancellation to
   establish closure on lead or lead element. OG/CCs may approve different climb and cruise
   airspeeds within dash one limits. (T-3).
   3.7.3. Battle damage/bomb check will be accomplished on RTB, when practical (i.e.,
   weather prohibits accomplishing BD check). This check is mandatory after expending any
   ordnance (including 20mm ammunition). (T-1).
   3.7.4. Accomplish air-to-air systems checks above 10,000 feet MSL when practical. (T-1).
   3.7.5. For further join-up procedures, see Night Operational Procedures (Section 3E) and
   Instrument Procedures (Chapter 4).

Section 3C—-Enroute

3.8. Air Refueling.
   3.8.1. Pilots undergoing initial or recurrency training in air refueling will not refuel with a
   student boom operator. (T-1). Lead/IP will announce when an upgrade or requal pilot is in
   the formation and will request a qualified (non-student) boomer. (T-1).
   3.8.2. Pilots will inform boom operator when refueling from particular tanker type (e.g., KC-
   10, KC-135) for the first time. (T-1).
   3.8.3. Quick flow procedures are authorized and will be conducted IAW ATP-56B and
   AFTTP 3-3.F-16. (T-1).
3.9. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC) and Automated Recovery Training Series
(ARTS)/Maneuvering Parameters.
   3.9.1. The following are the minimum altitudes for the prescribed maneuvers.
       3.9.1.1. Confidence Maneuvers/Advanced Handling - 10,000 feet AGL, except dive
       recovery maneuver (15,000 feet AGL minimum entry altitude). (T-1).
       3.9.1.2. Horn Awareness and Recovery Training series (HARTS) numbers 1, 2 and 3 -
       10,000 feet AGL. (T-1).
       3.9.1.3. HARTS series numbers 4 and 5 - 15,000 feet AGL. (T-1).
       3.9.1.4. Aircraft will not descend below 5,000 feet AGL during aerobatic maneuvering.
       (T-1).
       3.9.1.5. HARTS 3 with PARS – 10,000 feet AGL. (T-1).
       3.9.1.6. ARTS 2 – 8,000 feet AGL. (T-1).
       3.9.1.7. ARTS series number 1, 3, 4, and 5 – 5,000 feet AGL. (T-1).
 16                                                     AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013


   3.9.2. Avoid flight through wingtip vortices/jet wash. (T-1). If unavoidable, the aircraft
   should be unloaded immediately to approximately 1 G.
   3.9.3. Do not manually extend the trailing edge flaps in an attempt to improve aircraft
   performance. (T-1). EXCEPTION: Trailing edge flaps may be manually extended during
   intercepts performed by airspace control alert tasked unit aircraft, or during low/slow (below
   5000 feet AGL) VID training, on targets traveling at less than 200 KIAS.
   3.9.4. Do not attempt to bypass flight control limiters to improve performance. (T-1).
   Examples are: transfer fuel to alter center of gravity (CG), manual pitch override (MPO) to
   gain additional negative G or assaulting two limiters at low airspeed.
   3.9.5. The minimum airspeed for all maneuvering is based upon activation of the low speed
   warning tone. When the low speed warning tone sounds, the pilot will take action to correct
   the low speed condition. (T-1).
   3.9.6. The following is guidance for Horn Awareness and Recovery Training Series
   (HARTS) (reference AFTTP 3-3.F-16):
       3.9.6.1. HARTS maneuvers will be flown in CAT-1 loaded aircraft only. (T-1).
       3.9.6.2. In F-16 C/D Block 40-52 aircraft, do not fly HARTS maneuvers 4 and 5 unless
       in one of the following configurations: Clean (no tanks), or 300 gallon centerline tank.
       MAU-12s may be carried on stations 3 and 7, and/or AIM-9/AMDs/ACMI/CATM-120s
       may be carried on stations 1, 2, 8 and/or 9. CATM-120s will be symmetrically loaded if
       carried. AIM-9/AMD/ACMI can be symmetric or one missile asymmetric. Inlet
       mounted TGP and/or HTS pods may be carried. (T-1).
       3.9.6.3. For all F-16 Blocks, external tanks should be dry to avoid a faster than expected
       airspeed bleed-off due to excessive weight during the pull up, for all HARTS maneuvers.
   3.9.7. The following is guidance for Automated Recovery Training Series (ARTS) for
   AGCAS/ Pilot Activated Recovery System (PARS) recovery profiles (reference AFTTP3-
   3.F-16): (T-1).
       3.9.7.1. With exception of the HARTS 3 with PARS maneuver, AGCAS/PARS demo
       maneuvers may be flown in any aircraft configuration unless concern for over-g exists.
       However, a CAT I loading is preferred to demonstrate the full maneuvering potential of
       the automated recovery system. Potential for over-g exists if any Nose-low PARS
       maneuver is performed when the aircraft configuration has a symmetric g-limit of less
       than 6.2 g CAT I or 5.2 g CAT III.
       3.9.7.2. AGCAS recoveries shall not be demonstrated by executing dive maneuvers
       toward the ground. AGCAS is designed to provide a minimal buffer above the ground
       during recovery and must not be intentionally activated.
3.10. Formation, General. Flight leads and instructors will ensure contracts, roles and
responsibilities of each flight member are established, briefed, executed and debriefed. (T-1).
Flight members will immediately notify lead if unable to fulfill basic responsibilities, contracts
or other assigned tasks. (T-1). Flight leads will avoid tasking element leads/wingmen beyond
their abilities without sacrificing basic responsibilities. (T-1). Reference AFTTP 3-3.F-16 and
AFTTP 3-1.F-16.
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  17


   3.10.1. The flight lead is always responsible for flight actions. (T-1). Wingmen will be
   prepared to take the lead when directed. (T-1).
   3.10.2. In IMC, the maximum flight size in visual formation is four aircraft except when
   flying in close formation with a tanker. (T-1).
   3.10.3. Do not use rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain formation position below 5,000
   feet AGL or in airspace where aerobatics are prohibited. (T-1).
   3.10.4. Use airborne visual signals in accordance with AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and
   Formation Flight Signals, or detailed in local procedures. (T-1). Initiate configuration
   changes for four-ship flights by radio call, when practical. When formation position changes
   are directed by radio, all wingmen will acknowledge prior to initiating the change. (T-1). A
   radio call is mandatory when directing position changes at night or under instrument
   conditions. (T-1).
   3.10.5. Flight leads will not break up flights from visual or sensor formations until each pilot
   has a fix from which to navigate (visual, radar, INS or TACAN). (T-1).
   3.10.6. Lead changes.
      3.10.6.1. The minimum altitude for changing leads within a formation is 500 feet AGL
      over land or 1,000 feet AGL over water [see also Night Operational Procedures (Section
      3E)]. (T-1).
      3.10.6.2. During limited visibility conditions (e.g., night, IMC) initiate lead changes
      from a stabilized, wings level attitude [see also Night Operational Procedures (Section
      3E) and Instrument Procedures (Chapter 4). (T-1).
      3.10.6.3. Do not initiate lead changes with the wingman further back than normal
      fingertip or route position, or greater than 30 degrees back from line abreast. (T-1).
3.11. G-Awareness Exercises (G-Ex) (Reference AFTTP 3-3. F-16 and AFI 11-214).
   3.11.1. A G-Ex is required if planned maneuvering will exceed 5G. Accomplish the G-Ex
   day or night, only in VMC, with a discernible horizon, and only when unaided or NVG-aided
   visual cues are adequate to safely perform the maneuver. (T-1). If these requirements are not
   met, omit the G-Ex and reduce mission tasking to limit maneuvering to 5G. (T-1).
   3.11.2. Unless performing a syllabus required event (e.g., chase of a G-Ex), flight members
   will follow AFTTP 3-3.F-16 G-Awareness Exercise Procedures. (T-1). Use on-board
   systems (e.g. air-to-air TACAN, Radar, data link) to establish separation prior to maneuver
   execution. (T-1).
   3.11.3. Conduct the G-Ex in order of preference listed below to help ensure the airspace is
   clear from potential traffic conflicts. (T-1). If practical, use ATC to help clear the airspace:
      3.11.3.1. Special Use Airspace (e.g., Restricted/Warning areas, Air Traffic Control
      Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), MOAs and MAJCOM approved large scale
      exercise/special mission areas).
      3.11.3.2. In VFR only above 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace.
      3.11.3.3. In VFR only inside the confines of a Military Training Route (MTR).
 18                                                     AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013


      3.11.3.4. In VFR only below 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace.
   3.11.4. Flight/element leads flying outside of CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM,
   theater or host nation guidance on airspace in which G-Ex may be performed. (T-1). If no
   such guidance exists, follow the above procedures to the maximum practical extent.
3.12. Tactical Formations.
   3.12.1. Tactical Maneuvering. Wingmen/elements must maneuver relative to the flight
   lead/lead element and they must maintain sight. (T-1). Trailing aircraft/elements are
   responsible for deconflicting with lead aircraft/elements and will do so vertically when
   required. (T-1). At low altitude, wingmen/trailing elements will deconflict high. (T-1).
   Trailing aircraft/element(s) will maintain sufficient spacing so that primary emphasis during
   formation maneuvering/turns is on low altitude awareness and deconfliction within elements,
   not on deconfliction between elements. (T-1). Normally, the wingman is responsible for
   flight path deconfliction, but the flight/element lead becomes primarily responsible when: (T-
   1).
      3.12.1.1. Tactical maneuvering places the leader well aft of the wingman’s 3/9 line or
      forces the wingman’s primary attention away from the leader (e.g., wingman becomes
      engaged fighter).
      3.12.1.2. The wingman calls "padlocked".
      3.12.1.3. The wingman calls “blind”. Primary deconfliction responsibility transfers back
      to the wingman once the wingman acknowledges a visual on his lead.
   3.12.2. Loss of Visual (“Blind”) Procedures.
      3.12.2.1. Flight members will call blind with an altitude to the hundreds of feet, i.e.,
      “Blind 16.9”. (T-1). The visual flight member will respond with “visual” and talk eyes
      on. (T-1).
      3.12.2.2. If the other flight member is also “Blind,” they will call blind with an altitude.
      (T-1). Lead will be directive to ensure altitude separation is maintained and direct the
      wingman’s flow direction. (T-1). Use a minimum of 500 feet (1,000 feet above 5,000
      feet AGL) altitude separation. Avoid climbs/descents through the deconfliction altitude.
      All flight members must visually clear their flight path. (T-1).
      3.12.2.3. If there is no timely acknowledgment of the original "Blind 16.9" call, then the
      flight member/element initiating the call will maneuver away from the last known
      position of the other flight member/element and climb/descend if necessary. (T-1). If
      visual contact is still not regained, the flight lead will take additional positive action to
      ensure flight path deconfliction. (T-1). Scenario restrictions such as sanctuary altitudes
      and/or adversary blocks must be considered.
   3.12.3. Sensor formations. If SA is lost or “Blind” in a sensor formation, call “Blind” with
   altitude and follow the above procedures. (T-1). Wingmen will strive to maintain an altitude
   stack at all times in sensor formation. (T-1).
3.13. Chase Formation.
   3.13.1. Restrictions. Any pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft under emergency or
   impending emergency conditions. All chase events may be flown by IP/Flight Examiners
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  19


   (FEs) or upgrading IPs under the supervision of an IP. Qualified pilots, including Initial
   Qualification Training (IQT)/Mission Qualification Training (MQT) pilots who have
   successfully completed an Instrument/Qualification evaluation) may chase as safety observer
   for aircraft performing simulated instrument flight or hung ordnance patterns. Specialized
   missions (i.e., OT&E, Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP), live weapons delivery,
   etc) and training conducted IAW AFI 11-2F-16V1, F-16--Aircrew Training, may be chased
   by Combat Mission Ready (CMR)/Basic Mission Capable (BMC) pilots designated by
   group/squadron commanders.
   3.13.2. Procedures.
       3.13.2.1. On transition sorties, the chase aircraft will perform a single-ship takeoff. In-
       flight, the chase aircraft will maneuver as necessary, but must maintain nose-tail
       separation. The chase will not stack lower than lead aircraft below 1,000 feet AGL. In
       the traffic pattern, the chase aircraft may maneuver as necessary to observe performance.
       (T-1).
       3.13.2.2. A safety observer in chase will maneuver in a 30-60 degree cone with nose/tail
       clearance out to a range of 1 NM, from which he can effectively clear and/or provide
       assistance. (T-1).
       3.13.2.3. For live ordnance missions, the chase pilot is responsible for ensuring frag
       deconfliction is maintained for his aircraft. (T-1).
3.14. Show Formation. Such formations will be specifically briefed and flown IAW applicable
directives. Refer to AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy & Procedures, and applicable MAJCOM or
ANG directives for specific rules and appropriate approval levels to participate in static displays
and aerial events. (T-1).
   3.14.1. AGCAS SHOW mode may be selected only if operating IAW MAJCOM or ANG
   approved aerial events.
3.15. Low Altitude Operations (reference AFTTP 3-1. F-16 and AFTTP 3-3.F-16).
   3.15.1. Airspeed and Altitude. The minimum airspeed for low level navigation is 300 KIAS
   and the minimum altitude is 1,000 feet AGL (or IAW approved step-down training). For
   night or IMC operation, the minimum altitude is the MSA (see AFI 11-214) unless operating
   under NVG LOWAT Procedures. (T-1).
   3.15.2. At low altitude, the immediate reaction to task saturation, diverted attention, knock-
   it-off, or emergencies is to climb to a prebriefed safe altitude (minimum 1,000 feet AGL). (T-
   1).
       3.15.2.1. When a “PULL-UP-PULL-UP” warning sounds, the pilot will take immediate
       action to ensure terrain clearance, while referencing the primary flight instruments. (T-1).
       3.15.2.2. F-16’s with pilot-selectable GCAS Minimum Terrain Clearance (MTC) settings
       will set an altitude that does not result in “PULL-UP” warnings at normal operational
       altitudes. (T-1). Minimum MTC is 50 feet for strafe and visual bombing, and 25% of
       LOWAT Category minimum altitude for all other operations. Wings with significant tall
       trees in the operating area or VR routes will account for average tree height when setting
       MTC altitudes. (T-1).
 20                                                     AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013


       3.15.2.3. F-16’s equipped with an operational AGCAS will ensure NORM mode is
       selected prior to LOWAT operations down to 500’AGL to include HAS and LAS events.
       (T-1). If operations are required below 500’AGL, AGCAS MIN mode may be selected
       to prevent nuisance fly-ups. (T-3).
   3.15.3. Weather. Consult FLIP for minimum weather on a VR or IR route. For low altitude
   training outside the CONUS, comply with theater/host nation guidance. (T-1).
       3.15.3.1. Deteriorating weather on a VR Route.
           3.15.3.1.1. Able to maintain VMC. If it becomes apparent that weather ahead will
           not permit continued flight on the VR, maintain VMC, slow down, maneuver to exit
           the route structure, and establish a VFR hemispheric altitude. (T-0).
           3.15.3.1.2. Unable to maintain VMC. Climb to briefed deconfliction altitudes
           (reference Chapter 2). Squawk applicable (IFF/SIF) modes and codes and contact a
           controlling agency to pick up an IFR clearance if required. Maintain preplanned
           ground track. (T-1).
   3.15.4. Obstacle/Terrain Avoidance. If unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral
   separation from known vertical obstructions which are a factor to the route of flight, flight
   leads will immediately direct a climb NLT 3 NM prior to the obstacle to an altitude that
   ensures vertical separation. (T-1).
   3.15.5. At altitudes below 1,000 feet AGL, wingmen will not fly at a lower AGL altitude
   than lead. (T-1).
   3.15.6. When crossing high or hilly terrain, maintain positive G on the aircraft and do not
   exceed 120 degrees of bank. Maneuvering at less than 1 G is limited to upright bunting
   maneuvers. (T-1).

Section 3D—-Recovery and Landing

3.16. Gear Checks. For a VFR straight in, call gear down no later than 3 NM final. For an
instrument approach (reference Chapter 4), call gear down at the final approach fix or published
glide slope intercept point. For an overhead, call gear down departing the perch. For a SFO or
FO, call gear down at base key. (T-1).
3.17. Angle of Attack (AOA). Final approach will normally be flown at 11 degrees AOA.
Pilots will compare the computed final approach airspeed with AOA. (T-1).
3.18. Landing restrictions. When the computed landing roll exceeds 80 percent of the
available runway, land at an alternate if possible. When the RCR at the base of intended landing
is less than 10, land at an alternate if possible. Do not land over any raised web barrier (e.g.,
MA-1A, 61QS11). (T-1).
3.19. Desired touchdown point and spacing.
   3.19.1. The desired touchdown point is 500 feet from the aim point. The aim point for a
   VFR approach is the threshold. The aim point for a precision approach is the glide path
   interception point. To avoid possible speedbrake or nozzle damage, touch down either past a
   raised approach-end cable, or 500 feet prior to the cable. With centerline stores, touchdown
   will normally be past an approach-end cable. Circumstances that may dictate landing prior to
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   21


   the cable include runway length, wind, runway condition (wet or icy), gross weight or an
   aircraft malfunction where full normal braking may not be available. Single-ship or
   formation landings with centerline stores may be made across BAK-12 arrestment cables
   which have been modified with an 8-point-tie-down system. (T-1).
   3.19.2. Touchdown spacing behind an aircraft while flying a 13 degree approach will be a
   minimum of 6,000 feet due to susceptibility of the aircraft to wake turbulence and
   speedbrake/tail scrapes. Minimum pattern and touchdown spacing between landing aircraft
   is 3,000 feet for similar aircraft (e.g., F-16 following F-16), 6,000 feet for dissimilar fighter
   aircraft (e.g., F-16 following F-15) or as directed by MAJCOM or the landing base,
   whichever is higher. (T-1).
       3.19.2.1. When wake turbulence is expected due to calm winds or when landing with a
       light tail wind, spacing will be increased to 6,000 feet minimum. (T-1). Under these
       conditions, moderate to severe wake turbulence has been reported out to 7,000 foot
       touchdown spacing.
   3.19.3. All aircraft will land in the center of the runway and clear to the cold side when
   speed/conditions permit. (T-1).
3.20. Low Approaches.
   3.20.1. Observe the following minimum altitudes: (T-1).
       3.20.1.1. IP/FEs flying chase position: 50 feet AGL.
       3.20.1.2. Formation low approaches: 100 feet AGL.
       3.20.1.3. Chase aircraft during an emergency: 300 feet AGL unless safety or
       circumstances dictate otherwise.
   3.20.2. During go-around, remain 500 feet below VFR overhead traffic pattern altitude until
   crossing the departure end of the runway unless local procedures, missed approach/climbout
   procedures or controller instructions dictate otherwise.
3.21. Touch-and-Go Landings. Fly touch-and-go landings IAW AFI 11-202V3. Do not fly
them with live or hung external ordnance or with fuel remaining in any external tank. (T-1).
3.22. Overhead Traffic Patterns. Unless the OG/CC determines that local conditions (e.g.,
threat condition, populated areas) dictate otherwise, do not fly overhead patterns with
unexpended heavy-weight ordnance (larger than BDU-33). (T-3).
3.23. Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns. Tactical entry to the overhead traffic pattern is
permitted if the following conditions are met:
   3.23.1. Published overhead pattern altitude and airspeed are used.
   3.23.2. Specific procedures have been developed locally and coordinated with appropriate
   air traffic control agencies.
   3.23.3. The flight consists of a maximum of four aircraft (aircraft/elements more than 6,000
   feet in trail will be considered a separate flight).
   3.23.4. No aircraft offset from the runway in the direction of the break (the intent is to avoid
   requiring a tighter than normal turn to arrive on normal downwind).
 22                                                    AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013


   3.23.5. Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing are flown.
3.24. Closed Traffic Patterns. Initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway unless
directed/cleared otherwise by local procedures or the controlling agency. An element low
approach may be followed by a sequential closed with controller approval. Plan to arrive on
downwind at 200-250 KIAS.
3.25. Back Seat Approaches and Landings.
   3.25.1. An upgrading IP may only accomplish back seat landings when an IP is in the front
   cockpit. (T-1).
   3.25.2. During back seat approaches and landings, the front seat pilot will visually clear the
   area, monitor aircraft parameters/configurations and be prepared to direct a go-around or take
   control of the aircraft (as briefed by the rear cockpit IP) if necessary. (T-1).
3.26. Formation Approaches and Landings.
   3.26.1. Aircraft must be symmetrically loaded. (T-1). Consider symmetrical as those stores
   loadings which do not require an abnormal trim or control application to counter a heavy
   wing or yaw during takeoff and acceleration to climb airspeed.
   3.26.2. Elements will be led by a qualified flight lead unless an IP or flight lead qualified
   squadron supervisor is in the element. (T-1).
   3.26.3. Use a rate of descent similar to a precision approach. Fly a published precision
   instrument approach if one is available. If not, fly a non-precision approach or VFR straight
   in and reference available lighting systems (e.g., VASI, PAPI) for descent angle. (T-1).
   3.26.4. If the crosswind exceeds 5 knots, lead will position the wingman on the upwind side.
   (T-1).
   3.26.5. The wingman will maintain a minimum of 10 feet lateral wingtip spacing. If the
   wingman overruns lead after landing, accept the overrun and maintain the appropriate side of
   the runway and wingtip clearance. Do not attempt to reposition behind lead. (T-1).
   3.26.6. Do not make formation landings when: (T-1).
       3.26.6.1. The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots.
       3.26.6.2. The runway is wet or reported wet.
       3.26.6.3. There is ice, slush, or snow on the runway.
       3.26.6.4. The runway width is less than 125 feet.
       3.26.6.5. Arresting gear tape connectors extend onto the runway surface at the approach
       end of 125 feet wide runways (excluding overrun installations).
       3.26.6.6. Landing with hung ordnance or unexpended live bombs.
       3.26.6.7. The weather is less than 500 foot ceiling and 1.5 miles visibility (or a flight
       member's weather category, whichever is higher). This applies to chased approaches and

AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  23


3.27. General Night Procedures.
   3.27.1. Night Ground Operations. The anti-collision (strobe) light may be OFF and the
   position lights STEADY if they prove to be a distraction. Taxi spacing will be a minimum of
   300 feet and on the taxiway centerline. (T-1). The taxi light will normally be used during all
   night taxiing. Exception: When the light might interfere with the vision of the pilot of an
   aircraft landing or taking off, the taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be
   visually cleared without the taxi light.
   3.27.2. Night Takeoff. Aircraft will maintain the anti-collision light ON and position lights
   FLASH for takeoffs, unless IMC will be encountered shortly after takeoff. (T-3). Exception:
   For formation takeoffs, flight/element leads will turn the anti-collision light OFF and position
   lights STEADY after reaching the run-up position on the runway. During a night formation
   takeoff, brake release, gear retraction and AB termination will be called on the radio. (T-1).
   Following takeoff, each aircraft/element will climb on runway heading to 1,000 feet AGL
   before initiating turns, except where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance.
   (T-3).
   3.27.3. Night Join-up. Weather criteria for night join-up underneath a ceiling is 3,000 foot
   ceiling and 5 miles visibility. (T-1). After join-up, the anti-collision light will be OFF and
   position lights will be STEADY for all except the last aircraft, which will keep the anti-
   collision light ON and position lights FLASH unless otherwise directed by the flight lead.
   (T-3).
   3.27.4. Position/Lead Changes. Unless operating with NVGs, do not change lead or wing
   positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on radar downwind. Call such changes over the radio
   and initiate them from a stabilized, wings-level attitude whenever possible. (T-1).
   3.27.5. Night Break-up. Prior to a night formation break-up, the flight lead will confirm
   position and transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting. Wingmen will
   acknowledge and confirm good navigational aids. (T-1).
   3.27.6. Night Landing. Land from the most precise approach available. Night formation
   landings will only be performed when required for safe recovery of the aircraft. (T-1).
3.28. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Procedures.
   3.28.1. NVG Preflight. NVGs must be preflight tested and adjusted/focused for the
   individual pilot using (in order of preference) the Hoffman ANV-20/20 Tester, a unit eye
   lane, or equivalent. (T-1). Reference AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE)
   Program.
   3.28.2. Cockpit Lighting. Fly with NVGs only in aircraft whose cockpit lighting MAJCOM
   designates as NVG compatible. (T-2). MAJCOMs will only make such a designation if all
   control and performance instruments are sufficiently illuminated by the NVG-compatible
   lighting so as to make them immediately available to the pilot in the event they need to
   transition to instruments. (T-1).
   3.28.3. Weather/Visibility/Illumination Levels/Minimum Altitudes/Discernable Horizon.
   Reference AFI 11-214, AFTTP 3-3.F-16, and AFI 11-202V3. All pilots conducting NVG
   operations that include air-to-air/surface-to-air threat reactions or air-to-ground
   dynamic/diving deliveries will conduct a “30-Up and 30-Down” horizon orientation
24                                                     AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013


  maneuver before conducting tactical maneuvering.         (T-1). This maneuver will be
  accomplished in VMC, above the MSA and should be completed after the G-awareness
  exercise. The purpose is to evaluate horizon conditions and practice an NVG horizon
  orientation and crosscheck. If airspace precludes the maneuver, pilots operating on NVGs
  will limit maneuvers to AFI11-214 “Restricted Maneuvering” guidelines. (T-1). Pilots will
  adhere to the following guidelines when conducting the 30-Up and 30-Down maneuver: (T-
  1).
     3.28.3.1. In VMC conditions (with a discernible horizon), and with sufficient altitude
     (~3,000-5,000 feet) in approved operating airspace, accelerate to 350 KIAS minimum.
     Maintain a minimum spacing of 6000 feet between aircraft throughout the maneuver.
     The flight lead will announce, “Standby 30-UP, 30-Down” and will communicate a
     reference heading prior to execution for flight deconfliction. Flight members will verify
     correct spacing, heading, and entry parameters and will communicate “stand by” if not
     ready.
     3.28.3.2. Flight leads will command “30 Up,” and all pilots will execute a military
     power, 3-4 G wings-level pull up to place the bore cross on the 30 degree pitch ladder.
     Pilots will evaluate and orient themselves with the horizon in the forward quadrants, both
     above and below the horizon while maintaining intra-flight deconfliction contracts. Take
     note of the physical cranial movement required to move the NVG field of regard back to
     the horizon, as well as the condition of the horizon due to ambient factors. If at any time
     the airspeed drops below 250 KIAS, weather is encountered, or symptoms of spatial
     disorientation are recognized, the pilot will immediately transition to primary flight
     instruments, call a “knock it off (with reason),” and conduct an IMC nose-high recovery.
     3.28.3.3. After approximately 5 seconds, or sooner if airspace or altitude restrictions
     require, the flight lead will command “roll left (or right), 30 down”. All aircraft will roll
     inverted and accomplish the military power, 3-4 G wings-level pull to place the bore
     cross at the 30 degree nose-low, then roll upright on the reference heading. Once intra-
     flight deconfliction is assured, repeat the horizon crosscheck and visibility assessment
     while maintaining the 30 degree-nose low attitude.
     3.28.3.4. If during any portion of the maneuver a flight member determines that the
     visibility or horizon reference is unsuitable for tactical maneuvering per AFI-11-214
     guidance, the flight lead will modify the training profile and either transition to non-NVG
     formations or NVG formation tactics limited to AFI11-214 “Restricted Maneuvering”
     guidelines. Continually modify profiles or airspace utilization throughout the sortie if
     conditions change and no longer permit the planned maneuvering. Flight training
     modification includes: restricted maneuvering limitations (with or without NVGs) per
     AFI-11-214, a non-NVG formation IMC game plan, or accomplishing a briefed alternate
     mission without NVGs.
     3.28.3.5. Pilots will continually cross-check visually perceived attitude aided by NVGs
     with frequent cross-checks of primary flight instruments throughout the mission.
  3.28.4. NVG Qualifications. Do not wear NVGs in flight unless the pilot is NVG qualified
  or there is a qualified NVG IP in the flight (ratio of one NVG IP per non-NVG qualified
  pilot). (T-1). F-16B/D Familiarization flights are authorized if appropriate academics are
  accomplished and an NVG IP is in the front seat. (T-1).
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                 25


   3.28.5. Radio Calls. All flight members will make a radio call when donning, raising, or
   stowing NVGs. (T-1).
   3.28.6. Obstacle/Intra-Flight Deconfliction. When flying in route, only one flight member
   per element will don/raise/stow NVGs at a time. Flight leads will call turns if forced to
   maneuver while flight members are donning/raising/stowing NVGs. (T-1).
   3.28.7. Takeoffs/Landings. NVGs will be stowed or raised during takeoff until at or above
   2,000 feet AGL in climbing or level flight and only in VMC. Stow or raise NVGs no later
   than 5 minutes prior to landing unless NVGs are required to handle an emergency or mission
   requirements dictate. (T-1).
   3.28.8. NVG Use during Air to Air Refueling (AAR). Stow or raise NVGs no later than the
   stern position and resume NVG use no earlier than boom disconnect. (T-1).

Section 3F—-Other

3.29. Targeting Pod Operations. Do not use the TGP for anything other than navigational SA
below 1,000 feet AGL (e.g., Only VID aircraft, designate for weapons delivery, etc. above 1,000
feet AGL). (T-1). (USAFWC, Test, and AATC: Minimum altitudes for TGP operations are
established in WIC or test syllabus requirements, continuation training plans or operational test
and evaluation requirements).
3.30. Radio Procedures. Preface all communications with the complete flight call sign (except
for wingman acknowledgment). Transmit only that information essential for mission
accomplishment or safety of flight. (T-1).
   3.30.1. Radio Checks. Acknowledge radio checks, which do not require the transmission of
   specific data by individual flight members, in turn (EXAMPLE:               "2, 3, 4").
   Acknowledgment indicates the appropriate action is either complete, is in the process of
   being completed or is understood by the flight member. (T-1).
   3.30.2. Clearance Acknowledgement. All flight members will acknowledge understanding
   the initial air traffic control (ATC) clearance. If flight members are not monitoring in-flight
   ATC frequency, the flight lead will pass all ATC instructions to the flight. Flight members
   will acknowledge subsequent ATC instructions when directed by the flight lead. (T-1).
   3.30.3. Brevity code and other terminology will be IAW AFI 11-214 and AFTTP 3-
   1.General Planning, General Planning and Employment Considerations. (T-1).
   3.30.4. Ops Checks.
       3.30.4.1. Monitor the fuel system carefully to identify low fuel, trapped fuel or an out of
       balance situation as soon as possible. Frequency should be increased during tactical
       maneuvering at high power settings. Ops checks are required: (T-1).
           3.30.4.1.1. During climb or at level-off after takeoff.
           3.30.4.1.2. When external fuel tanks (if carried) are empty.
           3.30.4.1.3. Prior to each (D)ACBT engagement or intercept.
           3.30.4.1.4. Prior to entering an air-to-surface range, once while on the range if
           multiple passes are made and after departing the range.
 26                                                      AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013


       3.30.4.2. Minimum items to check are engine instruments, total and internal fuel
       quantities/balance, G-suit connection, oxygen system and cabin altitude. If the G-suit
       malfunctions or becomes disconnected, terminate all ACBT maneuvering until normal
       operation is reestablished. (T-1).
       3.30.4.3. For formation flights, the flight lead will initiate ops checks by radio call or
       visual signal. Response will be made by radio call or visual signal. (T-1).
           3.30.4.3.1. During Ops checks, ensure the fuel quantity selector knob is returned to
           the NORM position. (T-1). Totalizer-only Ops checks may be used periodically
           during high demand phases of flight.
           3.30.4.3.2. For mandatory ops checks when external tanks are carried, each flight
           member will check the external tank(s) and add “Tank(s) feeding/dry” to the Ops
           Check. (T-1). Once the tank(s) have been confirmed and called dry, this may be
           omitted from subsequent ops checks.
           3.30.4.3.3. Do not substitute data-linked fuel status for operations checks. (T-1).
3.31. Lap Belts. Use extreme caution when disconnecting the lap belt in flight due to potential
for lap belt buckle/side-stick controller/throttle interference.
3.32. Change of Aircraft Control. Both pilots of an F-16B/D must know at all times who has
control of the aircraft. Transfer of aircraft control will be made with the statement "You have the
aircraft." The pilot receiving control of the aircraft will acknowledge "I have the aircraft." Once
assuming control of the aircraft, maintain control until relinquishing it as stated above. (T-1).
Exception: If the intercom fails, the pilot in the front cockpit (if not in control of the aircraft)
will rock the wings and assume control of the aircraft, radios and navigational equipment unless
briefed otherwise. (T-3).
3.33. Fuel Requirements. (T-1).
   3.33.1. Joker Fuel. A briefed fuel quantity needed to terminate an event and proceed with
   the remainder of the mission.
   3.33.2. Bingo Fuel. A briefed fuel state which allows the aircraft to return to the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required, using preplanned recovery parameters and arriving
   with normal recovery fuel as listed below:
   3.33.3. Normal Recovery Fuel. The fuel quantity on initial or at the FAF at the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required. This fuel quantity will be the higher of what is
   established locally or:
       3.33.3.1. All F-16 Blocks 10 through 32 - 1,000 pounds.
       3.33.3.2. All F-16 Blocks 40 and higher - 1,200 pounds.
   3.33.4. Minimum/Emergency Fuel. Declare the following when it becomes apparent that an
   aircraft will enter initial or start an instrument final approach at the base of intended landing
   or alternate, if required, with:
       3.33.4.1. Minimum Fuel:
           3.33.4.1.1. All F-16 Blocks 10 through 32 - 800 pounds or less.
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                27


          3.33.4.1.2. All F-16 Blocks 40 and higher - 1,000 pounds or less.
       3.33.4.2. Emergency Fuel:
          3.33.4.2.1. All F-16 Blocks 10 through 32 - 600 pounds or less.
          3.33.4.2.2. All F-16 Blocks 40 and higher - 800 pounds or less.
   3.33.5. Afterburner Use. Do not use AB below 2,000 pounds total fuel or established bingo
   fuel, whichever is higher, unless required for safety of flight.
3.34. Radar Altimeters and Terrain Warning/Avoidance Systems.
   3.34.1. If the aircraft is equipped with such systems (CARA, DTS, PGCAS, AGCAS, etc.),
   turn them on for all flights. Set LIS altitude advisory as appropriate on all missions. PGCAS
   will be enabled with a minimum altitude setting of 200 feet for day operations and 700 feet
   for night operations. AGCAS mode (NORM/MIN/SHOW) will be set per mission
   requirements and confirmed mode selected. AGCAS should only be turned off if a known
   system malfunction affecting safety of flight requires system deactivation. Pilots will ensure
   that the appropriate values are set prior to takeoff. For low altitude operations GCAS
   settings, reference 3.15.2.2 this publication. (T-1).
3.35. ALOW Setting. Set the ALOW function of the radar altimeter at the briefed minimum
altitude, the command-directed minimum altitude, or as briefed, whichever is highest. (T-1).
3.36. Wind and Sea State Restrictions. Do not conduct training missions when surface winds
along the intended route of flight exceed 35 knots steady state. Do not conduct over water
training missions when surface winds exceed 25 knots steady state or when the sea state exceeds
10 feet (or 4 meters-USAFE). (T-1). This is not intended to restrict operations when only a
small portion of the route is affected. (T-3). The OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority.
3.37. Airborne Interrogator Friend Foe (AIFF) Operation. (T-1).
   3.37.1. To reduce the potential for adverse effects on Combat Identification, Air Traffic
   Control, and Traffic Collision Avoidance systems, pilots will limit interrogations to the
   minimum required for the mission.
   3.37.2. For AIFF operations within the United States and its Possessions (US&P), pilots
   will comply with the equipment and operational restrictions as specified in the applicable
   Radio Frequency Authorizations (RFA's) which can be obtained from the unit spectrum
   management office.

                                INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Head-Up Display (HUD) Use. Regardless of Block, do not use the HUD to recover
   from an unusual attitude or while executing lost wingman procedures except when no other
   reference is available. The HUD in F-16 Block 25/30/32 aircraft and Block 40/42/50/52
   aircraft has been certified as a primary flight instrument and may be used as a primary flight
   reference in night/IMC conditions. The HUD in all other F-16 Blocks may be used as an
   additional instrument reference only. No F-16 Block may use the HUD as the sole reference
   in night/IMC conditions. (T-1).
   4.1.2. INS/GPS or EGI Use. The F-16 INS/GPS and EGI are approved for enroute Area
   Navigation (RNAV). Neither RNAV nor GPS approaches are authorized.
   4.1.3. Simulated Instrument Flight. Simulated instrument flight requires a qualified safety
   observer in the aircraft or in a chase aircraft. The observer may occupy either seat of the F-
   16B/D provided the intercom is operable. Use the radar to aid in clearing the area. Pilots in
   F-16A/C aircraft may not log simulated instrument flight without a chase. They may fly
   multiple approaches in VMC without a chase, but will place their primary emphasis on
   seeing and avoiding other aircraft. Chase aircraft may move into close formation on final for
   a formation landing provided simulated instrument flight is terminated. (T-1).
4.2. Takeoff and Initial Join-up.
   4.2.1. If weather is below 1,500 foot ceiling and 3 miles (5 km), each aircraft and element
   will climb on takeoff heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating any turns, except when
   departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. (T-1).
4.3. Trail Procedures.
   4.3.1. General. During trail formations, basic instrument flying is the first priority and will
   not be sacrificed when performing secondary trail tasks. Strictly adhere to the briefed
   airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings and turn points. If task saturation occurs, cease
   attempts to maintain radar contact, immediately concentrate on flying the instrument
   procedure, then notify the flight lead. The flight lead will notify ATC. (T-1).
       4.3.1.1. Flight leaders will request non-standard formation from ATC. (T-1).
       4.3.1.2. ATC instructions issued to the lead aircraft apply to the entire flight.
       4.3.1.3. Normal spacing is 2-3 NM.
       4.3.1.4. Each aircraft and element will follow the No Radar/Sensor Contact procedures
       until the aircraft or element immediately in trail has radar/sensor contact and called
       "tied." (T-1).
   4.3.2. No Radar/Sensor Contact. (T-1).
       4.3.2.1. The flight leader will call initiating all turns. Subsequent aircraft must delay
       turns to maintain the desired spacing.
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   29


     4.3.2.2. Each aircraft and element will maintain 20 seconds or 2-3 NM spacing using all
     available aircraft systems and navigational aids to monitor position.
     4.3.2.3. During climbs and descents, each aircraft or element will call passing each 5,000
     foot altitude increment with altitude and heading (or heading passing) until join-up, level-
     off, or the following aircraft or element calls "tied."
     4.3.2.4. Each aircraft and element will call initiating any altitude or heading change.
     Acknowledgments are not required; however, it is imperative that preceding aircraft or
     elements monitor the radio transmissions and progress of the succeeding aircraft and
     elements, and immediately correct deviations from the planned route.
     4.3.2.5. Each aircraft and element will maintain at least 1,000 feet vertical separation
     from the preceding aircraft or element until establishing radar or visual contact, except in
     instances where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. Reduce vertical
     separation to 500 feet if necessary to comply with MSA restrictions.
     4.3.2.6. In the event a visual join-up cannot be accomplished on top or at level-off, the
     flight leader will request altitude separation for each succeeding aircraft or element to
     meet the requirements of the above paragraph.
  4.3.3. Radar Contact. (T-1).
     4.3.3.1. Each aircraft and element will call "tied" when radar contact is established with
     the preceding aircraft. Once all aircraft are tied, no further radio calls are required, except
     to acknowledge ATC instructions, unless radar contact is lost.
     4.3.3.2. In flights of three or more aircraft, use all available aircraft systems (i.e., radar,
     TACAN, AAI, etc.) to ensure that trail is maintained on the correct aircraft.
  4.3.4. Trail Departures. (T-1).
     4.3.4.1. Use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff spacing.
     4.3.4.2. Each aircraft/element will accelerate in MIL or AB power until reaching 350
     KIAS (or as required by local procedures). Upon reaching this speed, the flight leader
     will set a pre-briefed power setting. Climb at 350 KIAS until reaching cruise Mach/TAS,
     unless otherwise briefed.
     4.3.4.3. Make all turns using 30 degrees of bank.
  4.3.5. En Route Trail. Flight leads must brief airspeeds, power settings, and configurations.
  (T-1).
  4.3.6. Trail Recovery. (T-1).
     4.3.6.1. Trail recoveries are only authorized at locations where procedures have been
     established. Appropriate ATC agencies must approve and local operating procedures
     must address trail recovery procedures. As a minimum, procedures must address each
     recovery profile, missed approach, climb-out, desired and maximum spacing
     requirements, lost contact and lost communications.
     4.3.6.2. Limit trail recovery to a maximum of four aircraft.
 30                                                      AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013


       4.3.6.3. Trail recoveries are authorized when weather at the base of intended landing is at
       or above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or approach minimums,
       whichever is higher.
       4.3.6.4. The flight lead must brief the flight on spacing, configuration and airspeeds.
       4.3.6.5. The flight lead must coordinate the trail recovery with ATC prior to taking
       spacing.
       4.3.6.6. Prior to wingmen taking spacing for the trail recovery, the flight lead will ensure
       that all wingmen have operative navigational aids and radar.
       4.3.6.7. Accomplish flight separation IAW local directives and in VMC if possible.
       4.3.6.8. The formation must squawk as directed by ATC.
       4.3.6.9. ATC will provide radar flight following for the entire formation.
       4.3.6.10. Limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank.
       4.3.6.11. Once established on a segment of a published approach, each aircraft must
       comply with all published altitudes and restrictions while maintaining in-trail separation.
       4.3.6.12. Unless local procedures establish defined reference points for airspeed and
       configuration changes, the flight lead must direct changes by radio. At flight lead's call
       all aircraft must simultaneously comply with the directed change.
       4.3.6.13. All aircraft must report the final approach fix.
       4.3.6.14. If contact is lost with the preceding aircraft, the pilot will transmit "Callsign
       (C/S) lost contact." The preceding aircraft will respond with altitude, airspeed and
       heading. Establish altitude deconfliction and coordinate a separate clearance with ATC.
       If contact is lost while established on a segment of a published approach, flight members
       may continue the approach, but must confirm separation via navigation aids. If
       separation cannot be confirmed, execute missed approach or climb-out as instructed by
       ATC.
       4.3.6.15. Flight leads will coordinate with local ATC prior to penetration if the trail
       recovery will terminate in a Precision Approach Radar (PAR) or Airport Surveillance
       Radar (ASR) approach.
4.4. Formation Break-up. Formation break-up from a visual formation will occur in VMC. If
IMC is unavoidable, breakup from a visual formation will occur in straight and level flight. This
restriction does not apply to trail formation. Prior to an IMC break-up, the flight lead will
confirm position and transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting. Wingmen will
acknowledge and confirm good navigational aids (reception of appropriate TACAN, ILS and/or
appropriate GPS/INS waypoint). (T-1).
4.5. Formation Penetration. (T-1).
   4.5.1. Restrict formation penetrations in route or close formation to two aircraft when the
   weather at the base of intended landing is less than overhead traffic pattern minimums.
   4.5.2. If a formation landing is intended, position the wingman on the appropriate wing prior
   to weather penetration.
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                               31


   4.5.3. Formation penetrations using radar trail procedures are authorized when weather at the
   base of intended landing is at or above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or
   approach minimums, whichever is higher.
4.6. Formation Approach. During IMC formation flights, do not change lead or wing
positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on radar downwind or if required during a formation
approach with an F-16 experiencing an Emergency. (T-1).
4.7. Instrument Approach Procedures. (T-1).
   4.7.1. Pilots will not fly any published instrument procedure (e.g. DoD, Jeppesen, ICAO)
   that requires airspeeds less than those specified in T.O. 1F-16x-1.
   4.7.2. The F-16 is Approach Category E. If no Category E minimums are published,
   Category D minimums can be used, provided:
      4.7.2.1. A straight-in approach is flown.
      4.7.2.2. For the final approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 165 KIAS or less.
      4.7.2.3. For the missed approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 260 knots true airspeed
      (KTAS) or less. At high density altitudes 260 KTAS may require a KIAS below the
      speed specified in T.O. 1F-16x-1 and Category D approaches shall not be flown.

5.1. General. Reference AFI 11-214 for procedures and restrictions. In addition, F-16 pilots
shall comply with the requirements of this chapter. (T-1).
5.2. Simulated Gun Employment. (T-1).
   5.2.1. Never perform simulated gun employment with a hot gun (one that is not safe IAW
   T.O. 1F-16x-34-1-1). Never perform a trigger check with a hot gun, regardless of Master
   Arm switch position.
   5.2.2. Prior to flight, confirm the status of the gun system. Prior to simulated gun
   employment, perform a trigger check with the Master Arm switch in SIMULATE and the
   aircraft pointed away from other aircraft and populated areas. If HUD symbology reads
   “ARM” or SMS/MFD symbology reads “RDY,” do not squeeze the trigger or continue with
   simulated weapons employment.
5.3. Maneuvering Limitations. (T-1).
   5.3.1. Negative "G" guns jink maneuvers are prohibited.
   5.3.2. Minimum airspeed during low altitude offensive or defensive maneuvering is 350
   KIAS.
   5.3.3. All configurations are authorized for unlimited maneuvering as defined by AFI 11-
   214. Before conducting unlimited maneuvering in a CAT III configured aircraft, consider
   gross weight, drag, departure susceptibility and training requirements.
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   33

Section 6A—-General

6.1. General. Reference AFI 11-214 for procedures and restrictions. In addition, F-16 pilots
shall comply with the requirements of this chapter. (T-1).
6.2. Simulated Gun Employment. (T-1).
   6.2.1. Never perform a trigger check with a hot gun, regardless of Master Arm switch
   position.
   6.2.2. Never perform simulated gun employment (squeezing the trigger with the Master Arm
   switch in SIM) with a hot gun (one that is not safe IAW T.O. 1F-16x-34-1-1). This
   restriction does not apply on a controlled range against targets approved for gun employment
   with ammunition loaded.
   6.2.3. Prior to flight, confirm the status of the gun system. Prior to simulated gun
   employment, perform a trigger check with the Master Arm switch in SIMULATE and the
   aircraft pointed away from other aircraft and populated areas. If HUD symbology reads
   “ARM” or SMS/MFD symbology reads “RDY,” do not squeeze the trigger or continue with
   simulated weapons employment.
6.3. Training Missions with a Hot Gun. (T-1).
   6.3.1. Pilots will not select strafe submode until immediately prior to roll in and will deselect
   strafe submode immediately after completing the safe escape maneuver.
   6.3.2. When firing the laser, ensure you are not in a mode that will allow the gun to fire.
   6.3.3. AGCAS will not be disabled for strafe operations. (T-3). During LAS an automated
   recovery may occur near 2000’ slant range; therefore cease fire prior to 2000’ slant range or
   rounds may be employed well long of the target during automated pull-up.
6.4. Simulated Attacks against off-Range or Manned Targets. Do not conduct such attacks
with hung ordnance. Do not conduct them with live ordnance, except for 20 mm ammunition in
a gun safed IAW T.O. 1F-16x-34-1-1. When the aircraft is loaded with expendable stores (e.g.
bombs, external fuel tanks, TERs carted at the pylon), load simulated weapons (zero quantity) in
the SMS/MFD only on empty or uncarted/unexpendable stations (Exception: Captive Maverick
and HARM missiles may be selected). Confirm the Master Arm switch is in OFF or
SIMULATE prior to the first attack. Flight lead will query and flight members will reply to a
“check zero quantity, uncarted station” radio call. (T-1).
6.5. Weather. In training, do not conduct climbing or diving deliveries with a ceiling below
2,000 feet AGL or level deliveries with a ceiling below 1,500 feet AGL. (T-1).
6.6. Pop-Up Attacks. Abort pop-up attacks if airspeed decreases below 350 KIAS (300 KIAS
above 10,000 feet AGL). (T-1).
6.7. Target Identification. Pilots shall positively identify the target prior to weapons release.
For wartime or contingency sorties, comply with ROE. For training sorties, achieve positive
 34                                                     AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013


identification by either visually acquiring the target or by confirming target location through
valid on-board/off-board cues. Cues may include, but are not limited to, radar, GPS, marking
rounds, TGP or IR Maverick lock on, IR pointers or NVG-compatible marking devices.
Exercise caution when relying on a single cue to confirm target location. (T-1).
6.8. Safety of Ground Personnel. When ground controllers are present on Class B/C ranges,
range personnel will brief pilots on locations of these personnel and each pilot will acknowledge.
Pilots must know applicable range weapons delivery procedures, appropriate targets and
weapons footprints. Pilots shall not expend ordnance if any doubt exists as to the ground
personnel or intended target locations. (T-1).

Section 6B—-Night

6.9. Altitude. Compute an MSA for the entire bombing pattern using the guidance in AFI 11-
214. The minimum altitude for night High Angle Strafe (HAS) is the Target MSA (as defined in
Attachment 1) unless executed by an “NVG-LOWAT” or “NVG High Angle Strafe Low
Altitude” qualified pilot (as defined in AFI 11-2F-16 V1) under high-illumination conditions (as
defined in AFI 11-214). For HAS, pilots will review and confirm parameters prior to roll-in. (T-
1).
6.10. Bank Angle. Do not exceed 135 degrees of bank when returning to the low altitude
structure (<5K AGL). (T-1).
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  35


                                           Chapter 7

                        ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

7.1. General. Follow the procedures in this chapter when other than normal circumstances
occur. These procedures do not supersede procedures contained in the flight manual. (T-1).
   7.1.1. Do not accept an aircraft for flight with a malfunction which is addressed in the
   emergency/abnormal procedures section of the flight manual until appropriate corrective
   actions have been accomplished.
   7.1.2. Do not fly an aircraft with a tripped engine monitoring system (EMS) Go-No-Go
   indicator (Bit Ball) until maintenance has accomplished the appropriate procedures and
   cleared the fault.
   7.1.3. Do not taxi with a known malfunction of the nose-wheel steering system, the brake
   system, or a generator [Note: F-16C/D aircraft may be taxied with a single generator failure
   (main or standby) if the other generator is operating normally].
   7.1.4. Once a malfunctioning aircraft system is isolated, do not use that system again unless
   its use in a degraded mode is essential for recovery. Do not conduct ground or in-flight
   trouble-shooting after flight manual emergency procedures are complete.
   7.1.5. In the F-16B/D, the pilot in command is primarily responsible for handling in-flight
   emergencies. The additional pilot will confirm that all critical action procedures have been
   accomplished and will provide checklist assistance at the request of the pilot in command.
   7.1.6. For actual/perceived flight control malfunctions, pilots will terminate maneuvering
   and take appropriate action. If the problem was due to crew/passenger stick or rudder
   interference, the pilot will take positive action to ensure no further control interference
   occurs.
   7.1.7. When a fuel imbalance exceeds dash one limits, terminate tactical maneuvering and
   investigate. If the problem was caused by a slow feeding external or internal fuel tank and
   can be corrected, the mission may continue IAW TO 1F-16A/C-1. If not, terminate the
   mission. Instruments, deployment missions, level weapons deliveries and straight-through-
   non-maneuvering intercepts are authorized to reduce gross weight until a safe landing is
   possible.
7.2. Critical Action Procedures (CAPs). CAPs are in Attachment 4.
7.3. Ground Aborts. (T-1).
   7.3.1. If a flight member aborts prior to takeoff, the flight lead will normally renumber the
   flight to maintain a numerical call sign sequence. Flight leads will advise the appropriate
   agencies of such changes.
   7.3.2. Pilots who do not takeoff with the flight may join the flight in accordance with the
   brief or flight lead instructions. If a join-up is to be accomplished on an air-to-ground range,
   all events will be terminated until the joining aircraft has achieved proper spacing.
7.4. Takeoff Aborts. (T-1).
 36                                                      AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013


   7.4.1. If an abort occurs during takeoff roll, say call sign and intentions when practical.
   Following aircraft will alter takeoff roll to ensure clearance or abort takeoff if adequate
   clearance cannot be maintained. The phrase "Cable, Cable, Cable" will be used to indicate a
   departure-end cable arrestment. The phrase "Barrier, Barrier, Barrier" will be used to
   indicate a departure-end net arrestment. Local procedures will address net barrier raising
   procedures.
   7.4.2. When aborting above 120 KIAS, or whenever hot brakes are suspected, declare a
   ground emergency. Taxi the aircraft to the designated hot brake area and follow hot brake
   procedures.
   7.4.3. If aborting at or above 100 KIAS, lower the hook. If aborting below 100 KIAS, lower
   the hook if there is any doubt about the ability to stop on the remaining runway.
7.5. Air Aborts. (T-1).
   7.5.1. If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original numerical call
   sign.
   7.5.2. Escort aborting aircraft with an emergency condition to the field of intended landing.
   When other than an emergency condition exists, the flight lead will determine if an escort for
   the aborting aircraft is required.
   7.5.3. Abort the mission, regardless of apparent damage or subsequent normal operation, for
   any of the following:
       7.5.3.1. Bird strike
       7.5.3.2. Actual or suspected foreign object damage.
       7.5.3.3. Recovery below FRAG altitude with live ordnance.
       7.5.3.4. Moderate to severe icing.
       7.5.3.5. Over-G (Note: Land as soon as practical out of a straight-in approach).
       7.5.3.6. Flight control system anomalies, including uncommanded departures from
       controlled flight (Exception: intentional departures from controlled flight conducted
       IAW a MAJCOM-approved syllabus), but not including flight control system lights that
       reset IAW flight manual procedures.
       7.5.3.7. Engine flameout/stagnation or shutdown.
       7.5.3.8. Lightning strike.
7.6. Radio Failure (NORDO). Reference AFI 11-205 and the Flight Information Handbook.
   7.6.1. NORDO in Formation. (T-1).
       7.6.1.1. A pilot who experiences total radio failure while in close or route formation will
       maneuver within close/route parameters to attract the attention of another flight member
       and give the appropriate visual signals. The mission should be terminated as soon as
       practical and the NORDO aircraft led to the base of intended landing or a divert base. A
       formation approach to a drop-off on final should be performed unless safety
       considerations dictate otherwise.
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                 37


     7.6.1.2. If flying other than close/route formation when radio failure occurs, the NORDO
     aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position at approximately 500 feet on another
     flight member. The NORDO aircraft is responsible for maintaining clearances from
     other flight members until his presence is acknowledged by a wingrock, signifying
     clearance to join. Once joined, the NORDO aircraft will give the appropriate visual
     signals. If pre-briefed, the NORDO aircraft may proceed to a rendezvous point and hold.
     If no one has rejoined prior to reaching bingo fuel, the NORDO aircraft should proceed to
     the base of intended landing or a divert base.                Aircraft experiencing any
     difficulty/emergency in addition to NORDO will proceed as required by the situation.
  7.6.2. NORDO on a Class A Range or a Manned Class B Range.
     7.6.2.1. Attempt contact with the RCO on the appropriate back-up frequency or back up
     radio.
     7.6.2.2. If contact cannot be reestablished, make a pass by the range control tower on the
     attack heading while rocking wings and turn in the direction of traffic. The flight lead
     will direct another flight member to escort the NORDO aircraft to a recovery base or
     rejoin the flight and RTB.
     7.6.2.3. If the NORDO aircraft has an emergency, make a pass by the range control
     tower, if practical, on the attack heading while rocking wings, turn opposite the direction
     of traffic, and proceed to a recovery base. The flight lead will direct a flight member to
     join-up and escort the emergency aircraft.
  7.6.3. NORDO on an Unmanned Class B Range or on a Class C Range.
     7.6.3.1. Make a pass on the target maintaining normal pattern spacing, if possible, while
     rocking wings. The flight lead will direct another flight member to escort the NORDO
     aircraft to a recovery base or rejoin the flight in sequence and recover. If the NORDO
     aircraft has an emergency, if practical, it will make a pass on the target maintaining
     normal pattern spacing, rocking wings, turn opposite direction of traffic and proceed to a
     recovery base. The flight lead will direct a flight member to join-up and escort the
     emergency aircraft.
     7.6.3.2. Unexpended Ordnance. If radio failure occurs and circumstances preclude
     landing with unexpended ordnance, safe jettison of ordnance may be accomplished
     provided the following conditions are met:
     7.6.3.3. The NORDO aircraft joins on another flight member who has radio contact with
     the RCO and the remainder of the flight.
     7.6.3.4. Stores jettison visual signals specified in AFI 11-205 are relayed to the NORDO
     aircraft to initiate jettison.
  7.6.4. NORDO during Missile or Air-to-Air Gunnery Firing.
     7.6.4.1. Aircraft will not fire without two-way radio contact.
     7.6.4.2. If radio failure occurs, safe the armament switches, join on another member of
     the flight or the tow aircraft, IAW paragraph 7.6.1
     7.6.4.3. Gunnery target tow aircraft experiencing radio failure will rock wings and
     continue the turn if an attack is in progress. The flight lead of the attacking aircraft will
 38                                                     AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013


       join on the tow's wing. Remain clear of the banner in the event it is cut. The tow pilot
       will use standard hand signals to indicate his difficulty. The flight lead will signal when
       the banner is cleared for cut with a slicing motion across the throat. After the banner is
       away and the flight lead determines there is no remaining cable, he will take the lead,
       RTB with the tow aircraft on the wing, advise the tower of the NORDO and establish the
       appropriate landing pattern. If cable remains, follow local procedures.
   7.6.5. NORDO during Recovery.
       7.6.5.1. If a formation straight-in approach is flown and a go-around becomes necessary,
       the chase will go-around, pass the NORDO aircraft and rock his wings. The NORDO
       aircraft will go-around, if the situation allows. If the NORDO aircraft is in formation as a
       wingman, the leader will initiate a gentle turn into the wingman and begin the go-around.
       7.6.5.2. To signal the need for an approach-end arrestment, lower the tailhook (visual
       formation) or fly a straight in approach flashing the landing light (unescorted).
7.7. Severe Weather Penetration. Do not fly through severe weather. If unavoidable, flights
will split-up and obtain separate clearances prior to severe weather penetration. (T-1).
7.8. Spatial Disorientation (SD). SD has proven to be a leading killer of F-16 pilots. Although
SD is most common at night or in IMC, it can and has happened in day VMC. Reference
AFMAN 11-217V1 for information on the causes of SD, how to avoid it, and how to mitigate its
consequences.
   7.8.1. Enabling PARS is an acceptable recovery method from SD induced unusual attitudes,
   reference AFTTP 3-3.F16 for recommended throttle techniques during PARS recoveries.
   7.8.2. Pilots should ensure deconfliction from other aircraft (primarily above or below their
   position) prior to PARS activation.
7.9. Lost Wingman. (T-1).
   7.9.1. Priorities. The first priority is to establish safe separation from other aircraft (e.g.,
   tanker or wingman). Next, obtain a separate clearance to ensure obstacle/terrain clearance
   and clearance from other traffic.
   7.9.2. Prohibitions.   Do not practice lost wingman procedures in other than day VMC
   conditions.
   7.9.3. General Procedures. Simultaneously transition to instruments and inform lead while
   executing lost wingman procedures (ref AFTTP 3-3.F16 for amplifying data). Lead will
   acknowledge the radio call and transmit attitude, heading, altitude and airspeed. Once lost
   wingman procedures have been executed, permission to rejoin must be obtained from the
   flight lead.
   7.9.4. Two- or Three-Ship Flights. (Note: If in three-ship echelon, refer to four-ship lost
   wingman procedures.)
       7.9.4.1. Wings-Level Flight (climb, descent or straight and level). Simultaneously
       inform the leader and turn away using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds, then resume
       heading and obtain a separate clearance.
AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013                                                                 39


      7.9.4.2. Outside the Turn. Reverse the direction of turn using 15 degrees of bank for 15
      seconds and inform the leader. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to
      resuming the turn. Obtain a separate clearance.
      7.9.4.3. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation and
      inform the flight lead to roll out of the turn. Maintain angle of bank to ensure lateral
      separation and obtain a separate clearance. The leader may resume turn only when
      separation is ensured.
      7.9.4.4. Precision/Non-precision Final. The wingman will momentarily turn away to
      ensure clearance, inform lead, and commence the published missed approach procedure
      while obtaining a separate clearance.
      7.9.4.5. Missed Approach. The wingman will momentarily turn away to ensure
      clearance, inform lead, and continue the published or assigned missed approach
      procedure while climbing to 500 feet above missed approach altitude. Obtain a separate
      clearance.
   7.9.5. Four-Ship Flights. If only one aircraft in the flight becomes separated, the previous
   procedures would provide safe separation, but since it is impossible for number 4 to
   immediately ascertain that number 3 still has visual contact with the leader, it is imperative
   that number 4's initial action be based on the assumption that number 3 has also become
   separated. Numbers 2 and 3 will follow the procedures outlined above. Number 4 will
   follow the appropriate procedure listed below:
      7.9.5.1. Wings-Level Flight. Simultaneously inform the leader and turn away using 30
      degrees of bank for 30 seconds, then resume heading and obtain a separate clearance.
      7.9.5.2. Outside the Turn. Reverse direction of turn using 30 degrees of bank for 30
      seconds to ensure separation from lead and number 3 and obtain a separate clearance.
      7.9.5.3. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation and
      increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Inform the leader to roll out. Obtain a separate
      clearance. Leader will resume turn only when separation is ensured.
7.10. Armament System Malfunctions. (T-1).
   7.10.1. General. Do not attempt to expend ordnance using a weapons release system with a
   known malfunction. If abnormal missile launch or erratic missile flight occurs, have the
   launching aircraft visually inspected by a chase pilot, if possible, to determine if any damage
   has occurred.
   7.10.2. Inadvertent Release. Record switch positions at the time of inadvertent release and
   impact point, if known, and provide the information to debrief personnel. Check switches
   safe and do not attempt further release in any mode. Treat remaining stores as hung and
   obtain a chase aircraft for RTB, if practical. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard,
   jettison in a suitable area on a single pass, if practical.
   7.10.3. Hung Freefall Ordnance or Missile Hangfire/Misfire. First confirm switches/SMS
   settings were correct. If they were, record all relevant switch/SMS settings and proceed as
   follows.
 40                                                      AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013


       7.10.3.1. Hung Live Freefall Ordnance. Attempt delivery using an alternate delivery
       mode, if applicable. If unsuccessful, use selective jettison procedures for the store. If
       unsuccessful and the ordnance is either unsecure or the security of the ordnance cannot be
       determined, consider selective jettison of the rack.
       7.10.3.2. Hung Practice/Inert Freefall Ordnance. Make an additional attempt to expend.
       If unsuccessful, select an alternate delivery mode and try again. If unsuccessful,
       ordnance from other stations/dispensers may be released provided this does not violate
       load symmetry limits. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison in a suitable
       area on a single pass, if practical.
       7.10.3.3. Maverick Missile Hangfire. A missile that fires but fails to depart the aircraft is
       a hangfire. If able, have a chase pilot inspect such a missile.
       7.10.3.4. Maverick Missile Misfire. A missile that fails to fire when all appropriate
       switches were selected is a misfire. If this occurs, safe the Master Arm switch. If able,
       have a chase pilot inspect the missile for smoke or fire. If either exists, jettison the
       missile on the range. If not, pilots may attempt another pass. If the second attempt fails
       and conditions permit, remain dry in the pattern for 15 minutes, then proceed to the
       recovery base following hung ordnance/weapons malfunction recovery procedures.
       7.10.3.5. Hung Ordnance/Weapons Malfunction Recovery Procedures. Visually inspect
       the aircraft for damage, if practical. Declare an emergency (not required for hung
       practice/inert ordnance or hung rockets). Obtain a chase aircraft, if available. Avoid
       populated areas and trail formations. Land from a straight-in approach.
7.11. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures. Reference AFI 11-202V3. A simulated
emergency procedure is any procedure that produces an effect closely paralleling the actual
emergency. One example would be retarding the throttle sufficiently to emulate the performance
of an aircraft with a flamed out or idle engine.
   7.11.1. Prohibitions. Do not practice aborted takeoffs in the aircraft. Instead, use the flight
   simulator, Cockpit Familiarization Trainer or a static aircraft, in that order of preference. Do
   not practice in-flight engine shutdown. Do not practice SFO patterns unless crash rescue is
   available and either an active tower or a ROM (or equivalent, e.g. SOF) is in operation. Do
   not practice SFO patterns in conditions other than day VMC. (T-1).
   7.11.2. Simulated Flameout (SFO)/Emergency Landing Patterns. OG/CCs will establish
   specific procedures for SFO training and establish letters of agreement with appropriate
   agencies. They will publish those procedures in their supplement to this volume. General
   SFO procedures follow: (T-1).
       7.11.2.1. The SFO pattern may be entered from any direction or altitude that will ensure
       the aircraft is properly configured above 2,000 feet AGL and in a position to safely
       complete the approach.
       7.11.2.2. Do not initiate or continue an SFO if a potential traffic pattern conflict exists
       that would require division of the pilot’s attention between the SFO and sequencing with
       traffic. Discontinue an SFO whenever excessive maneuvering is required, whether as a
       result of a traffic conflict or when making corrections. Discontinue an SFO if unable to
       obtain wings level on final by 200 feet AGL. Discontinue an SFO if airspeed drops

       below Dash One minimum airspeed any time between base key and the initiation of the
       flare. Once the decision to discontinue an SFO has been made, initiate a go-around and
       do not attempt to resume the SFO.
       7.11.2.3. Except when operating IAW a MAJCOM-approved syllabus (e.g., AFMC high
       angle of attack training), do not touch down from an SFO.
       7.11.2.4. Make radio calls IAW local procedures, but as a minimum call.
           7.11.2.4.1. "High Key"
           7.11.2.4.2. "Low Key"
           7.11.2.4.3. "Base Key, Gear Down, (Intentions)"
7.12. Search and Rescue (SAR) Procedures. General directive procedures are listed below.
OG/CCs will establish specific procedures in the unit supplement to this volume. (T-1).
   7.12.1. Squawk. Immediately cease tactical maneuvering by executing Knock-It-Off
   procedures. Place IFF to EMER to alert ATC/GCI/AWACS of the emergency situation.
   7.12.2. Talk. Establish an On Scene Commander (OSC). Communicate the emergency
   situation and intentions immediately to applicable control agencies. Use GUARD frequency
   if necessary.
   7.12.3. Mark. Mark the last known position of survivors/crash site using any means
   available, e.g. visual ground references, TACAN, INS, EGI, ATC/GCI/AWACS, HMCS, or
   TGP. Pass this information to follow-on SAR forces.
   7.12.4. Separate. Remain above the last observed parachute altitudes until the position of all
   possible survivors is determined. If visual contact with parachute is not maintained, allow
   approximately 1 minute per thousand feet (16 feet per second) for parachute descent. The
   OSC will establish deconfliction between all aircraft involved in the SAR.
   7.12.5. Update Bingo/Recovery Base. Revise bingo fuels or recovery bases as required to
   maintain maximum SAR coverage over survivor(s). Do not overfly bingo. Relinquish OSC
   duties to more qualified rescue forces (e.g., SANDY 1, US Coast Guard) upon their arrival.
   7.12.6. For overwater SAR/CSAR, OSC will utilize every means available (visual, TGP,
   Radar Ground Map, or Ground Moving Target Modes) to locate vessels that may aid in
   recovery.
7.13. Post Arresting Gear Engagement Procedures. Do not shut down the engine unless
fire/other conditions dictate or directed to do so by the arresting gear crew. Raise the tailhook on
the signal from the arresting crew. Do not taxi until directed to do so by the arresting gear crew.
(T-1).

    CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH YIELD
                 EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) OPERATIONS (T-1)

A2.1. General Information. Potential adversary use of CBRNE weapons against a friendly
airfield presents a serious threat to flying operations. Although the most effective way for
aircrews to avoid this threat is to be airborne before those weapons are detonated/dispersed and
then land at a field that has not been contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate
from a field that has come under CBRNE attack.
A2.2. Mission Preparation. Be aware of the status of the CBRNE environment at the planned
launch and recovery airfields, potential divert bases, and throughout the area in which the sortie
may fly. Know the current and forecast surface wind direction and the MOPP level in effect for
relevant sectors of the airfield. Don appropriate aircrew chemical defense equipment (ACDE) or
Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) to match the appropriate MOPP level (reference AFMAN 10-
100) and carry individual protective equipment (IPE) as required.
A2.3. Stepping to Fly and Aircraft Preflight. This may entail donning ACDE or transitioning
from GCE to ACDE. Take precautions to protect aircrew from injury and or contamination
while in transit from the squadron facility to the aircraft. If possible, transport aircrew in a
vehicle that provides overhead cover (enclosed vehicle). If aircrew travel on foot is unavoidable,
choose a route that takes maximum advantage of available overhead cover (sun shades,
buildings, etc.) to avoid agents that may be settling from the air. If extra aircrew members are
available for preflight duties, consider assigning them to do so wearing GCE. This will allow the
aircrew actually flying to minimize exposure.
   A2.3.1. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) Prior to Engine Start. If Alarm Red occurs
   during the step or preflight process, take cover and don appropriate MOPP. This may require
   use of the ground crew mask. A hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) provides optimum
   protection, if available. Use caution if entering a HAS that contains aircraft and/or
   equipment. Close doors after entry. If a HAS or other overhead cover is not immediately
   available, accept the best rapidly reachable cover.
A2.4. Engine Start to Takeoff. If a HAS is available, use it to minimize exposure time by
accomplishing aircraft arming and End of Runway (EOR) procedures inside it (if local
procedures permit) and by delaying taxi time as long as possible prior to takeoff.
   A2.4.1. Aircraft Launch to Survive (LTS). Units will develop local procedures to provide
   this option to the commander. In general, aircraft may LTS any time after engine start if they
   have sufficient fuel and safe, expeditious access to a runway. This option may only be
   practical for aircraft that are near EOR prior to takeoff or that have just landed.
   A2.4.2. Alarm Red Prior to Taxi. If in a HAS, the normal procedure is to shut down.
   Engine noise may preclude effectiveness of normal alert notification procedures, so ensure
   ground personnel are aware of the alarm warning, assume proper MOPP, and close HAS
   doors. Use hand signals if necessary.
   A2.4.3. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) After Taxi. Units typically establish procedures
   for this contingency depending on whether additional protection is available along the taxi
   route (empty HAS, for instance). Ideally, ground crew sheltering in such a HAS would be
 50                                                     AFI11-2F-16V3 18 DECEMBER 2013


   available to assist in normal engine shutdown procedures and to close HAS doors. If
   protection is not available, the best option may be LTS. Maintain contact with Command
   and Control (C2) entities (Wing Operations Center, Maintenance Operations Center,
   Supervisor of Flying, etc.) to ensure unity of effort in the overall plan.
A2.5. Takeoff to Landing.
   A2.5.1. Contamination. If Chemical Warfare (CW) agent contamination occurred prior to
   takeoff, flying the aircraft will dissipate the agent to some degree. The total amount of
   dissipation will be greater with lower flight altitudes and longer flight times. Because the
   agent may have entered wheel wells, flaps, etc., consider flying in landing configuration to
   increase airflow to these areas. In any circumstances, merely flying the aircraft is unlikely to
   achieve complete decontamination.
   A2.5.2. Preparing to Land. Aircrew should remain aware of the status of primary and
   alternate landing locations. Do not attempt to land during Alarm Red situations unless there
   is no other option. Follow C2 directions and either hold or divert. If mission needs preclude
   divert, hold until the Alarm Red (or theater equivalent) has cleared or become an Alarm
   Black. Prior to landing, gain awareness of contaminated sectors of the airfield and of
   current/forecast surface winds. Use this information in conjunction with C2 direction to plan
   a route from landing to engine shutdown. The liquid deposition phase following a CW
   airburst attack can extend up to 1 hour. If landing during Alarm Black, expect a
   contaminated environment and MOPP 4.
A2.6. Landing to Engine Shutdown. Take advantage of any protection available, minimizing
taxi time and distance. Maintain contact with C2 in order to remain aware of unexploded
ordnance and/or damage to airfield movement surfaces. If a HAS is available and local
procedures permit, accomplish aircraft de-arm and EOR procedures there. If Alarm Red (or
Theater Equivalent) occurs between landing and engine shutdown, considerations are similar to
those discussed in the engine-start-to-takeoff section.
A2.7. After Engine Shutdown. Don appropriate MOPP if not already worn. If circumstances
permit, accomplish normal post-flight inspection procedures. If the aircraft is not contaminated,
close the canopy. If there is any suspicion of personnel contamination, aircrew will process
through an aircrew contamination control area (ACCA). Accomplish maintenance debriefings
under cover to the maximum extent possible.
