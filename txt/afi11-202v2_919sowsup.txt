SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is revised to align with AFI 11-202 Vol 2 and AFSOC Sup 1. The use of Information
Management Tool (IMT) will be used in lieu of the term ―form‖. Note: All Privacy Act Information and
Social Security Numbers will not be included on the IMTs and sent electronically. The social security
number and any other Privacy Act data pertinent to the individual will be on the printed final copy of the
IMT. All references to the 8th SOS and the MC-130P have been removed. Format of Supplement has

been changed to conform with Tenth Air Force (10 AF) (Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC))
standards vice AFSOC as coordinated with Headquarters (HQ) AFSOC A3V.
1.3.1. (Added) Waivers. All waivers for flight operations will be coordinated through 919 OG/OGV.
See the waiver matrix in the current Flight Crew Information Summary (FCIS) for specific guidance on
routing coordination and approval authority. 919 OG/OGV will document, track, review, make
recommendations, and forward all waivers through the appropriate command channels.
1.3.2. (Added) 919 OG/OGV maintains applicable waivers on file for reference. Status of open/pending
waivers will be briefed semi-annually at the Standarization/Evaluation Board (SEB). Note: Training
waivers are processed by 711 SOS/Training (DOT).
2.3.2.7. Master Question Files (MQF) questions and review will be accomplished IAW paragraph
6.4.4.2.
3.2.2.4.1. The Trend Program will use PEX tracking of discrepancies and missed test questions to
compile date for trend analysis.
3.2.2.4.1.1. (Added) A trend is a recurring deficiency requiring corrective action. Trends are established
by the OG/CC at the SEB as a result of analysis of deficiencies. Objectives analysis of deficiencies
requires a meaningful quantity of data. A deficiency meets the threshold of a trend when, 1.) a question
missed 20% of the time with a sample size greater than 10 attempts; 2.) an evaluation area/sub area
downgraded on 20% of administered evaluations; or 3.) a requisite test questions missed more than
twice during a half. Meeting trend threshold alone is not the sole means of designating a deficiency as a
trend. The OG/CC is the final authority for trend designation. (Note: FTU trending will be tracked
separately).
3.2.2.4.1.2. (Added) Grading Areas. All downgrades (Q and U) will be included in trend analysis.
Review specific downgrade descriptions for all grading areas that meet the percentage criteria for a
trend. If the discrepancies correlate to a single significant knowledge deficiency, the area will be
designated a trend. If discrepancies in a grading area do not correlate to a single knowledge deficiency,
the area is not necessarily a trend.
3.2.2.4.1.3. (Added) An observation is a recurring deficiency that approaches but does not meet the
trend threshold. Examples of an observation are a question/area missed 10 to 19 percent of the time with
a sample size greater than 10 or a question/area missed greater than 20 percent of the time with a sample
size less than 10. Once an observation is established, OGV will:
3.2.2.4.1.3.1. (Added) Expand the data sample size by including the previous semiannual trend analysis
cycle and determine if the reoccurring deficiency warrants designation as a trend without meeting the
20% threshold.
3.2.2.4.1.3.2. (Added) The 919 OG/OGV will notify the 919 OG/CC and the appropriate squadron
commander/operations officer of trends and potential trends. 919 OG/OGV will brief the actual results
of the trend analysis at the semi-annual SEB meeting. The trends will also be published via the SEB
minutes. The SEB will address the causes and determine corrective action(s) for trend areas.
3.2.2.4.1.3.3. (Added) Corrective actions for trends and observations are the same. OGV recommends
and the OG/CC approves corrective actions. OGV recommends and the OG/CC designates the
appropriate POC/OPR to implement and report completion of each corrective action.
3.2.2.4.1.4. (Added) Corrective actions include, but are not limited to: tailored periodic examination,
SEFE training emphasis, Unit Training Assembly (UTA) pilot briefing, and bulletin board slides with
appropriate information. Effectiveness of corrective actions will be verified with control measures.
AFI11-202V2_919SOWSUP 22 JUNE 2009                                                                    3


Control measures include, but are not limited to: supplementary evaluations (supp evals), SPOT evals,
No-Notice evals, testing, and tape review.
3.2.2.5. The supplementary evaluation program will be used to verify compliance with
directives/procedures and to gather additional information for OG/CC use on any topic. Supp evals may
encompass ground and/or flight events. The OG/CC will designate the OPR, objectives, scope,
methodology and suspense of supp evals. Upon completion of the supp eval, the OPR will brief the
OG/CC on the results. Document supplementary evaluation details and track all findings in the SEB
until closed. Reference Attachments 16 and 17 for example letters of notification and results reporting.
3.2.2. 6 Stan/Eval Board. A SEB should convene during the UTA following the end of a semi-annual
period (NLT Feb and Aug). Membership includes the 919 OG/CC (Board President), 919 OG/OGD, 5
SOS/CC or DO, 711 SOS/CC or DO, 919 SOW/SE, 919 OG/OGV assigned evaluators (unit
evaluators/training officers are invited). 919 SOW/CC and 919 SOW/Vice Commander (CV) are always
invited to attend the SEB. The meeting will be conducted by the 919 OG/OGV Chief, or designated
representative.
3.2.2.6.1. (Added) SEB Agenda (Attachment 19). An agenda letter will be sent to the board members
specifying the time and place of the SEB. The agenda will be in accordance with applicable AFIs and
MAJCOM supplements.
3.2.2.6.2. (Added) SEB Minutes. Board minutes will be published by 919 OG/OGV. SEB minutes,
since the last formal Stan/Eval visit, will be placed on the 919 OG/OGV website.
3.2.2.7. To ensure the quality of the unit FCIF program, at a minimum OG/OGV will review the FCIF
library annually in the first half and include results in subsequent SEB minutes. This will satisfy the
requirements for annual Flight Manual reviews IAW AFI 11-215.
3.2.2.8. To ensure the quality of the flight publications program, at a minimum OG/OGV will review the
flight publications annually in the second half and include results in subsequent SEB minutes. This will
satisfy the requirements for annual reviews IAW AFI 11-215.
3.2.2.9.4. (Added) OGV will maintain an AF Form 847, tracking log until the change is incorporated or
disapproved. Each AF Form 847 submitted will be tracked in the SEB until closed. Flight Engineers
(FE) will actively solicit for necessary changes from examinees upon completion of EPEs and testing.
3.2.2.9.5. (Added) Members may submit AF Form 847 via email IAW instructions found on the unit
Stan/Eval webpage at: https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=RC-OP-
01-38.
3.2.2.12. (Added) The 919 OG/OGV will conduct No-Notice evaluations as a subset of periodic and
SPOT evaluations. The program intent is candid appraisal of typical continuation training missions. The
evaluations should be proportionately distributed (approximately equal percentage) between each type
of evaluation. An effort should be made to sample all crew positions (instructor pilot, copilot, flight
engineer, loadmaster, radio operator, etc.). OGV will report evaluation distribution and results at the
SEB.
3.2.2.12.1. (Added) The OG/CC goal for no-notice evaluations is a minimum of 15% for each Mission
Design Series (MDS) per Calendar Year (CY). Efforts will be made to evaluate each crew position to
this number in each MDS, but is not required as long as the 15% for each MDS is met.
3.2.2.12.2. (Added) No-Notice evaluations will be scheduled as directed by the 919 OG/CC, Squadron
Commander/Operations Officer, or 919 OG/OGV. Coordination will be done at the daily 1230 update
4                                                          AFI11-202V2_919SOWSUP 22 JUNE 2009


on the day of the evaluation. Examinees will be informed of a No-Notice evaluation no later than the
scheduled mission briefing time.
3.2.2.12.3. (Added) 919 OG/OGV will track the No-Notice evaluation program and document the
results in the Stan/Eval Board minutes. The No-Notice program is not intended as aircrew harassment,
but as a tool to validate tactics and training. Unless substandard performance is suspected individuals
should not be administered more than one no-notice evaluation per year.
3.2.2.12.4. (Added) Unless commanders specify otherwise, no-notice evaluations will be conducted
within six months following any failed evaluation, to assess continued performance and verify
progression.
3.2.3. Operations Group Standardization/Evaluation (Stan/Eval) Organization. The 919 SOW
Stan/Eval function is centralized under the 919 OG Commander (919 OG/CC) and managed by the
Chief of Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation (919 OG/OGV). The 919 OG/OGV manages all
squadron Stan/Eval functions for the 5 SOS and 711 SOS (5 SOS see the Wing to Wing Memorandum
of Agreement (MOA) for exceptions). 919 OG/OGV includes representatives from both the MC-130E
and PC-12/U-28 reserve aircrew force. The PC-12/U-28 representatives of 919 OG/OGV will
functionally operate out of the 5 SOS, Hurlburt Field, FL, for ease of coordination and management of
the 5 SOS squadron Stan/Eval functions. However, they will be managed directly by the Chief of 919
OGV.
3.2.3.1.1. (Added) Chief of Stan/Eval Responsibilities. In addition to responsibilities set forth in AFI
11-202, Vol 2, and the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) Supplement 1, the Chief of

4.2. Selection.
4.2.1.1. (Added) Flight Examiner Upgrade Program. 919 OG/OGV will administer the flight examiner
upgrade program for Reserve personnel. Experienced, highly qualified instructors nominated by their
squadron commanders will complete training IAW the Flight Examiner Upgrade Worksheet
(Attachment 11) to upgrade to flight examiner. Once training is complete, nominees will be scheduled
by 919 OGV to meet the Certification Board IAW paragraph 7.2.1.
4.2.1.2. (Added) As a minimum, individuals re-qualifying as flight examiners will be given a review of
current Stan/Eval publications, procedures and philosophy by 919 OG/OGV and interview with the 919
SOW/CC. Follow the certification guidance given above.
4.2.3. 919 OG/OGV Chief or designated representative will administer any flight examiner upgrade

Secondary Method of Training evaluations should be accomplished by 919 OG/OGV Flight Examiners
if available.
4.3.5. The flight examiner briefing (Attachment 13) will include any necessary scenario information the
examinee has not already received, and should make clear what the Flight Examiner expects of the
examinee and what the examinee may expect from the flight examiner. Specific grading criteria will be
briefed. Any unique flight examiner requirements will be identified to the examinee at least one day
prior to scheduled evaluation. The flight examiner’s briefing will not infringe on allocated mission
planning or briefing time of the examinee.
4.3.5.1. (Added) After the evaluation, the flight examiner will debrief the examinee on the results of the
evaluation and ensure the examinee is aware of the overall grade, any restrictions, additional training, or
remaining requirements (for incomplete evaluations). The flight examiner will complete the AFSOC
Form 48, MC-130 (Crew Position) Flight Evaluation Worksheet with appropriate grades, an overall
grade, and examiner’s remarks to include: mission description, discrepancies, required additional
training, instructor capabilities, and remaining requirements (for incomplete evaluations). The Flight
Examiner will forward the completed AFSOC Form 48 to Squadron CC/DO for their review and
remarks if any via email, and to 919 OG/OGV via e-mail and signed hard copy (IAW Paragraph
5.1.2.). If additional training is required, the flight examiner will debrief an appropriate squadron
supervisor and 919 OG/OGV (as stated in paragraph 5.2.12.2.).
4.3.5.2. (Added) If the evaluation is incomplete, the flight examiner will notify 919 OG/OGV either the
day of or the morning following the flight periodic evaluations, the examinee is responsible for making
himself/herself available to complete all ground and flight phase requisites within their eligibility period.
For initial/prequalification evaluations, the examinee is responsible for completing all ground phase
requisites prior to the flight evaluation. The examinee is responsible for understanding the grading
criteria in advance of any requisite or flight evaluation. In addition, the examinee is responsible for
resolving any questions about the evaluation by asking the flight examiner.
4.3.9. (Added) Prior to an evaluation of any type, the flight examiner should review AFI 11-202, Vol 2
(along with the AFSOC Supplement and this local 919 SOW Supplement) and
AFI 11-2MC-130, Vol 2, MC-130 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria. Flight Examiners will brief their
examinee(s)     on       the    type      of     evaluation,      expectations     and    requirements
accordance with the Flight Examiner Briefing Guide (Attachment 13) located at:
https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=RC-OP-01-38.

tailored to their experience by the OG/CC in accordance with paragraph 4.2.1.1.
5.1. Evaluations.
5.1.1. (Added) Control of Evaluations. 919 OG/OGV uses PEX to monitor requisite, flight evaluation
and additional training completion, and to maintain/update the Aircrew Examination/evaluation Status
Report. Section schedulers are responsible for scheduling and pre-coordinating flight evaluations with
919 OG/OGV via telecom or e-mail to 919og.ogv@eglin.af.mil.
5.1.1.1. (Added) Once notified, 919 OG/OGV will e-mail the flight examiner the necessary evaluation
documents. This e-mail will contain a Flight Examiner Briefing Guide an appropriate AFSOC Form
48(X), Crew Position Evaluation, AF IMT 4031, CRM Skills Criteria Training/Evaluation, and list any
special requirements (i.e., Night Mountainous Terrain-Following, examination remaining, etc) or

5.1.1.2. (Added) Once the flight evaluation is complete, the flight examiner will complete the
appropriate blocks of the AFSOC Form 48 email and print out and sign a copy, to be kept in the
individuals Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) as a temporary evaluation certificate, until the original AF
Form 8 is complete. Return the AFSOC Form 48 via e-mail to and hard copy to 919 OG/OGV within 3
working days.
5.1.2. (Added) Scheduling of Evaluations. A Zone Notification Letter (Attachment 14) will be sent to
each crewmember when they enter their evaluation eligibility period, listing the eligibility period, type
evaluation required and instructions on how to proceed with requisite completion.
5.1.2.1. (Added) 919 OG/OGV will maintain and update an Aircrew Examination/Evaluation Status
Report (Attachment 12), located on the OGV website at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=-2193284 This report will list all required written
examinations, type of flight evaluation, and the month by which they need to be completed. This report
will list each crew member who has entered their 6-month eligibility period for periodic evaluations and
examinations.
5.1.2.2. (Added) Individuals who receive a No-Notice outside their zone and the decision is made to use
that evaluation as a periodic evaluation will also be listed on the report with the date by which the
individual must complete their requisites for the evaluation to count as a periodic evaluation. Section
supervisors will schedule their aircrew members for completion of all evaluation and examination
requirements.
5.2.2. Combined Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. Flight evaluations will be conducted in
accordance with applicable AFIs. Pilots should accomplish Instrument/Qualification flight evaluations
and Mission flight evaluations on separate sorties. All other crew positions will accomplish a combined
Qualification/Mission evaluation.
5.2.4. Ground Phase Requisites. Examinees should make every effort to complete ground evaluation
requisites within the first four months of the eligibility period. Individuals entering their fifth month will
be scheduled to accomplish their requisites during the next training period (UTA, Additional Ground
Training Period (AGTP), unless squadron CC/DO dictates otherwise. Section schedulers should attempt
to schedule personnel to complete their ground requisites at the beginning of their eligibility period.
Squadron CC/DO/Section supervisor will be notified by 919 OG/OGV if anyone fails to complete their
ground requisites within their eligibility period and of the required supervised status of the individual via
the 919 OGV Notification Letter (Attachment 15).
5.2.5. Flight Phase Requisites. Squadron section supervisors should normally schedule an individual to
complete the flight phase of a periodic evaluation no later than the fifth month of eligibility to preclude
delinquent evaluations. The sixth month of eligibility is considered a backup for the completion of
canceled or incomplete evaluations, or other unusual circumstances. Squadron CC/DO/Section
supervisor will be notified by 919 OG/OGV if anyone fails to complete their flight requisites within
their eligibility phase and of the required supervised status of the individual via the 919 OG/OGV
Notification Letter (Attachment 15).
5.2.5.1.1. (Added) Incomplete Flight Evaluations. The flight examiner will clearly indicate on the
AFSOC Form 48 any required grading areas that were not observed. The flight examiner will grade the
areas that were observed and debrief, or prescribe additional training and restrictions, as appropriate, for
all Q or U areas/sub areas. Include the mission description and any other pertinent information on the
AFSOC Form 48. Return the AFSOC Form 48 to 919 OG/OGV. 919 OG/OGV will inform the
appropriate squadron section supervisor that the evaluation was incomplete, and what events need to be
scheduled for completion.
AFI11-202V2_919SOWSUP 22 JUNE 2009                                                                     7


5.2.5.1.2. (Added) The squadron section supervisor will schedule the individual to complete the flight
evaluation. 919 OG/OGV will provide the original evaluation documentation AFSOC Form 48
electronically via e-mail to the flight examiner. At a minimum, the flight examiner will confirm all
remaining areas/sub-areas to complete the evaluation, administer the remainder of the flight evaluation,
and document completion on the AFSOC Form 48.
5.2.7. RequisiteCompletion. 919 OG/OGV tracks requisite completion though an automated Stan/Eval
program and notifies section supervisors and/or squadron commanders via the Aircrew
Examination/Evaluation Status Report located on the OGV website. When an individual successfully
completes all required requisites for an evaluation AF IMT 1522, ARMS Additional Training
Accomplishment Report (TAR) and an AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification
Worksheet (as appropriate) is generated by OGV and sent to squadron Aviation Resource Management
System (ARMS) personnel for input.
5.2.12.2. Additional Training.
5.2.12.2.6. (Added) When additional training is required as the result of an evaluation, the flight
examiner will debrief the appropriate Squadron CC/DO and 919 OG/OGV. This can be done in person,
via e-mail or telephone, but must be conducted the day or night of or no later than the morning
immediately following a night flight. The debriefing will include the downgraded area(s), recommended
training, additional training due dates, and any restrictions imposed. 919 OG/OGV will pass this
information on to the squadron section supervisor and squadron training officer via the 919 OGV
Notification Letter with a required completion date.
5.2.12.2.7. (Added) The flight examiner will document the information on the AFSOC Form 48 and
forward it to 919 OG/OGV who will prepare the AF Form 8 IAW AFI 11-202 Vol 2 and AFSOC SUP
1. OGV will place the individual in supervised/restricted status in PEX with the required additional
training. OGV will brief the operations supervision on the requirements to complete the assigned
additional training and complete the evaluation. The squadron DO/CC or Squadron Training officer, if
designated is responsible for ensuring completion of requirements, and will monitor PEX to track
completion of assigned additional training by the due date.
6.3.2. (Added) All test banks (MQFs, SQBs, etc.) will be maintained by OGV using PEX. Alternate
areas/means for examinations (i.e. deployed, other room, hard copy) are authorized if approved by
OGV, and the test is administered by a SEFE or other Stan/Eval personnel. Boldface and closed book
tests will be taken in a single session, while the open book, instrument, Operation Supervisor (Ops Sup)
/Supervising Duty Officer (SDO), SEFE tests can be completed during more than one session. Hard
copy open book examination materials are available in the testing room in OGV. All tests should be
graded immediately upon completion. In the event of a PEX malfunction, hard copy testing is available
in OGV. Hard copy tests will be scored and tracked manually and the completed test will be placed in
the Check Ride in Progress (CIP) folder. Tests taken as a hard copy will be manually entered into PEX
for trending. In the event of a failure, PEX will automatically indicate a red (No-Go status) under TEST.
6.3.4. Examination Question Review. MQFs and SQBs will be reviewed annually during the first half
for accuracy and currency and documented in subsequent SEB minutes. After publications release, the
corresponding questions in the MQF and SQB will be reviewed for accuracy and removed from
examinations as appropriate.
6.4. Requisite Examinations. Prior to accomplishing any Stan/Eval qualification/mission written
examination at 919 OG/OGV (Qual examinations for pilots), aircrew will have their personal set of
publications checked by an instructor/flight examiner (the flight examiner may be any crew position but
must be current and qualified in the respective MDS). A list of current publications will be maintained
8                                                           AFI11-202V2_919SOWSUP 22 JUNE 2009


and published by the 919 OG/OGV on the 919 Stan/Eval CoP. Individuals will use this list to update
their personal publications. Instructors/Flight Examiners will use this list to conduct publications checks
and will document the check on a publication check letter that will be given to 919 OG/OGV by the

OG/OGV. The FCIF library for the 5 SOS will be a combined 5th/19th SOS library kept at Hurlburt in
the combined mission planning area. The FCIF Library will be maintained by the 1st OGV and 19th
Standardization Evaluation (DOV), with assistance from the 919 OG/OGV members attached to the 5th
SOS. 919 OGV assigned personnel will monitor and update this library for accuracy and applicability
particularly when a publication contains an AFRC supplement.
9.1.1.1. (Added) 919 SOW FCIF backup plan is as follows: For deployed or contingency operations,
laptops with current FCIF and Read File will be deployed to support the aircrew. In addition, one
Supervisor of Flying (SOF) kit will be deployed to ensure all required hard copy publications are
available at the deployed location. OGV will contact the deployed location and ensure they receive new
FCIF information if appropriate. In addition to being backed up on the 919 OG local area network
(LAN), all information pertinent to the FCIF Program is backed up monthly on a stand-alone hard drive
in OGV.
9.1.2.1. The FCIF Part A index is as electronically displayed by PEX.
9.1.2.2. 919 SOW will use PEX to electronically document positive verification of FCIF Part B and Part
C items. OGV will maintain a backup paper copy located in the 919 OG/OGV office. Part B will
contain, as a minimum, an approved date, a control number, subject, Originator and Originator Title,
expiration date, and suspense date. Note: The subject should match the MAJCOM FCIF subject, when
applicable. The No-Go box will be checked for all Part B items. Units will review items for applicability
in conjunction with the semi-annual FCIS.
9.1.2.3. (919 SOW) 919 SOW will maintain and identify a squadron-specific Part C read file in PEX. At
a minimum, Part C items will be verified by crewmembers monthly in conjunction with the UTA. Even
if not safety of flight related, commanders may request that these items may be issued as a Part B FCIF
item when deemed necessary for review as soon as possible.
9.1.3. Publications Library. 919 OG/OGV will announce the release of applicable publications,
technical orders, checklists, changes, supplements, message traffic, etc, via an FCIF Part B item. 919
OG/OGV will maintain a current FCIF library at the 919 OGV Stan/Eval. An FCIF library will also be
maintained at the 711th Squadron operations desk, this library will be maintained and updated by the
Operations Desk personnel except for Volume 1 items which will be the responsibility of the 919
OG/OGV. The FCIF library for the 5 SOS will be a combined 5 SOS/19 SOS library kept at Hurlburt in
the combined mission planning area. The FCIF Library will be maintained by the 1 OGV and 19 DOV,

with assistance from the 919 OG/OGV members attached to the 5 SOS. 919 OGV assigned personnel
will monitor and update this library for accuracy and applicability particularly when a publication
contains an AFRC supplement.
9.1.3.1. Control and Distribution. Once a new publication is released by 919 OG/OGV FCIF item, the
squadron publications office will be notified and responsible for acquisition and distribution to all
applicable crewmembers.
9.3. Go/No-Go Procedures.
9.3.2. The PEX Go/No-Go computer program located at the Ops Sup/SDO counter can be used by pilots
to record and track the review or accomplishment of certain Go/No-Go items. Currently PEX is used to
track and indicate Go/No-Go status using DNIF, S/E testing, FCIF, etc. Pilots indicating ―red‖ in these
columns are not cleared to fly.
9.3.2.1. (Added) Current items tracked in PEX as FCIF items include (not limited to): FCIF B read file,
FCIF C read file, boldface, init/annual read file review, publication issue (flight), Safety read file, semi-
annual test accomplishment, and Operation Supervisor/SDO read file. All items above will be entered as
a ―no-go‖ item until PEX allows for a ―yellow‖ status in the FCIF column, then FCIF C read file items
will not be ―no-go‖. The primary OPR for FCIF item entry into PEX is OGV but it can be implemented
on the squadron level by PEX administers. 919 OG/OGV will maintain and publish a Letter of X’s on
the 919 Stan/Eval CoP for reference use. The letter will indicate current individual qualifications and
will be used in conjunction with each Squadron’s Go/No-Go Procedures.
9.3.2.2. (Added) Aircrew members will be displayed by a colored dot indicating his/her current status in
each column. ―Red‖ indicates that a crew member cannot fly until the current items are accomplished
and/or signed off in PEX. A ―yellow‖ status (when implemented) indicates that a crew member has a
non-grounding item to sign off, but can still fly. A ―green‖ status indicates that all Go/No-go items for
that column are satisfied, cleared to fly.
9.3.2.3. (Added) Current Aeronautical Order will always need to be checked manually using the ARM
currency report regardless of PEX implementation.
9.3.2.4. (Added) (919 SOW) As a positive control measure, the Ops Sup/SDO will terminate the Ops
Sup/SDO briefing if any crew member is found to be in a No-go status. Once the No-Go status has been
changed/documented the Ops Sup/SDO briefing can continue.
9.3.2.5. (Added) In addition, the Ops Sup/SDO will review the Ops Sup/SDO Currency Report for
training items/currencies (non-grounding) that may affect mission profiles.
9.3.2.6. (Added) Backup Procedures. In the event of PEX failure, or password problems when signing
off PEX FCIF items, a pilot may document FCIF accomplishment by indicating ―thru FCIF XX-XX‖ on
the flight authorization. In the event that the local PEX system is not available (i.e. deployed), the flight
authorization (or other manual means), or locally developed system will be used to document FCIF
Go/No-go status.
9.3.3. (Added) Prior to each flight, aircraft commanders will check their crew’s Go/No-go status. The
Ops Sup/SDO, DO, and 1CO also have redundant responsibilities to ensure Go/No-go status so that no
aircrew/team member flies ―in the red‖. Training items accomplished, but not yet entered in ARMs (i.e.
red on the ARMS Currency Report or under the training column when implemented in PEX) must be
verified accomplished. Document training event accomplishment on an AF IMT 1522, TAR sheet, or in
the remarks section of the Flight Authorization prior to the Ops Sup/SDO brief.
AFI11-202V2_919SOWSUP 22 JUNE 2009                                                                 13


9.3.4. (Added) Squadron ARMS. 919 OG/OGV is responsible for updating ARMS with completion
dates for Stan/Eval-controlled events (i.e., FEF Reviews, Evals, certifications, upgrades, special
qualification upgrades, instructor-certified events, etc). Only 919 OG/OGV is authorized to update
ARMS with completion dates for Stan/Eval-controlled events. 919 OG/OGV will provide this
information on an AF Form 4324 or an AF IMT 1522 to the Aviation Resource Management Office.
Once all requisites are complete, 919 OG/OGV will fax the AF Form 4324 or AF IMT 1522 to SARM.
SARM will process and store all forms as necessary. SARM will sign off the AF Form 4324 and send a
copy to 919 OG/OGV and the squadron training officer for their records.
9.7. (Added) Hostile Environment Repair Procedures (HERP) The 919 OG/OGV will oversee the
HERP program to ensure standardized equipment and training are utilized for each squadron and
aircraft. The kits will be supplied and maintained by each respective squadron.
9.8. (Added) Crew Resource Management Program (CRM) The 919 OG/OGV Chief will be the CRM
Program Manager for the 5th and 711th flying Squadrons. CRM training for all crew positions will be
accomplished IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, AFRC Sup 1.
The program manager will be responsible for ensuring the program material is updated and made
available to each squadron on a quarterly basis per AFI 11-290 AFRC Supp 1. Each Squadron CC/DO
will be responsible for ensuring the information is being utilized by their respective squadrons. 919
OG/OGV will provide squadrons with the Quarterly AFRC CRM Special Interest Item (SII) via FCIF.
Aircraft Commanders will brief the current CRM SII during each mission brief. The quarterly SII and
CRM power point presentation for the quarter will also be provided to each squadron via the squadrons,
Aircraft Commander’s CRM briefing guide, provided by 919 OG/OGV and kept at each squadron’s
operations desk. The SII and Briefing Guide will also be posted on the 919OG/OGV website. The
