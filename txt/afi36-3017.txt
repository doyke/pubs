SDAP is an incentive to induce enlisted members to qualify for and serve in designated duties involving
the performance of extremely difficult duties or duties demanding an unusual degree of responsibility.
This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 36-30, Military Entitlements, and tells how to
administer the SDAP program. It explains how to award, terminate, and change SDAP ratings and lists
the jobs and SDAP for each (Table 1.).
This instruction requires unit commanders to collect information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974.
The authorities to collect the records prescribed in this instruction are Title 10, United States Code
(U.S.C.), Sections 8013 and 8032. The Privacy Act of 1974 applies to this instruction. Under the Privacy
Act, before asking for personal information the unit commander must show and, if asked, give personnel
a Privacy Act Statement for each form or memorandum used to collect the information. System of
Records Notice F177 AF AFC D, Joint Uniform Military Pay System (JUMPS), also applies. Process sup-
plements that affect any military personnel function as shown in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 37-160, vol-
ume 1, table 3.2, The Air Force Publications and Forms Management Programs--Developing and
Processing Publications (formerly Air Force Regulation (AFR) 5-8).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This is the initial publication of AFI 36-3017, substantially revising AFR 39-45, 31 July 1991. It provides
guidance on what constitutes previous creditable experience and adds four new special duty assignments:
PAVE LOW Aerial Gunners, PAVE HAWK Aerial Gunners, members of Headquarters Joint Special
Operations Command, and Flying Crew Chiefs; and makes changes to recruiters serving in the field
(Table 2.). It also tells how personnel become eligible for SDAP (Table 3.).


1. Who Can Receive SDAP? To be eligible, enlisted members must:
2                                                                            AFI36-3017 10 JUNE 1994


    1.1. Serve on active duty (not including less than 180 days active duty for Reserve training) and earn
    basic pay.
    1.2. Have a pay grade of E-3 or higher.
    1.3. Have completed special schooling or equivalent on-the-job training for the assignment.
    On-the-job training must last as long as special schooling.
    1.4. Work at an SDAP duty (Table 2.).
    1.5. Be eligible and qualified, as certified by the unit commander.

2. Responsibilities:
    2.1. Unit Commanders:
       2.1.1. Identify members who are qualified and eligible for SDAP, and start the pay. Unit com-
       manders may not delegate this authority.
       2.1.2. Certify eligibility for members on the monthly SDAP roster and return the roster to the ser-
       vicing Military Personnel Flight (MPF) noting additions, deletions, or errors.
       2.1.3. Counsel unit members on changes in SDAP ratings and initiate and certify these changes.
       2.1.4. Counsel members on rate changes and terminations. Table 1. lists current SDAP rates.
       2.1.5. Submit AF Form 2096, Classification/On-the-Job Training Action, or special orders for
       actions affecting an airman's SDAP.
       2.1.6. Perform additional responsibilities outlined in AFMAN 36-2622, Base Level Military Per-
       sonnel System (formerly AFM 30-130).
    2.2. MPFs:
       2.2.1. Update all SDAP program actions in the Personnel Data System (PDS) using source docu-
       ments from the units.
       2.2.2. Produce the monthly SDAP roster, send it to unit commanders for certification, and make
       any changes they require.
       2.2.3. Report to DFAS-DE/JPQ, HQ AFMPC/DPMYCO, and HQ USAF/DPXF any PDS prob-
       lems that interfere with updating SDAP status or paying individuals.
       2.2.4. Resolve differences between the base level, Headquarters Air Force (HAF), and JUMPS
       data files using the JUMPS data reconciliation.
       2.2.5. At least 90 days in advance, announce the date when SDAP decreases or ends. Table 3. and
       the DoD Pay and Entitlements Manual (DoDPM), table 1-8-2, list the reasons for termination.
       SDAP stops on the dates listed in these tables unless the commander sets an earlier date. Members
       assigned to these duties after the effective date earn the pay that was in effect when they qualified
       for the SDAP duty.
       2.2.6. Carry out the additional responsibilities outlined in AFMAN 36-2622.
    2.3. HQ USAF/DPXF:
       2.3.1. Submits budgets.
AFI36-3017 10 JUNE 1994                                                                                 3


       2.3.2. Tracks expenses.
       2.3.3. Works with Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) and sister services.
       2.3.4. Recertifies approved duties.
   2.4. Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Denver (DFAS-DE):
       2.4.1. Keeps the information needed to update JUMPS current.
       2.4.2. Pays authorized recipients.
       2.4.3. Reports SDAP expenses to HQ USAF/DPPR.

3. Designating a Duty for SDAP.
   3.1. The Air Force Career Field Managers (AFCFM), Major Commands (MAJCOM), Field Operat-
   ing Agencies (FOA), or Direct Reporting Units (DRU) can request that a duty be part of the SDAP
   program.
   3.2. Include this information in your request:
       3.2.1. The number of members and how long they have been working on the duty in an Air Force
       Specialty Code (AFSC), Special Duty Identifier (SDI), or Reporting Identifier (RI).
       3.2.2. Turnover and volunteer rates.
       3.2.3. Whether the special duty assignment is part of the normal career progression for the duty.
       3.2.4. Special individual qualifications.
       3.2.5. Other special pay received for the duty (such as diving duty pay and hazardous duty pay).
       3.2.6. Proposed SDAP rate, an estimate of how long the designation will be needed, the number
       of members eligible, and the annual cost.
       3.2.7. Special screening and schooling needed, other than a brief orientation.
       3.2.8. Explain how positions are extremely demanding or highly responsible duties that require
       extraordinary physical effort or place a heavy personal burden on the member, over and above
       what would reasonably be expected in a military assignment for a member's grade and experience.
   3.3. Do not include in your request for SDAP any elements of a position or AFSC that are part of the
   justification for a person performing that duty to receive special or incentive pay. EXAMPLE: The
   fact that a duty involves aerial flight will not be used to justify SDAP if the people performing the
   duty already receive hazardous duty incentive pay because they perform aerial flight.
   3.4. Send your requests to HQ USAF/DPX. If an SDAP affects more than one MAJCOM, FOA, or
   DRU, send it to the AFCFM who will consolidate it and send it to HQ USAF/DPX.
   3.5. HQ USAF/DP grants or rejects requests for designating an SDAP duty.
   3.6. HQ AFMPC/DPMYCO helps base-level personnel make changes the new designation demands
   and makes sure the information needed for PDS updates are current and compatible with JUMPS.

4. Recertification. As initiators of approved requests, you must justify the designation every 2 years
(HQ USAF/DPXF will notify you at the appropriate time). If you fail to provide the biennial justification,
AF/DPXF may initiate action to reduce or eliminate the pay.
