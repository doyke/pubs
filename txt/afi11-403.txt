              AEROSPACE PHYSIOLOGY TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Personnel Who Require AP Training.
   2.1.1. Aircrew (includes government civil service). All 11X, 12X, 13BX, 46F, 48G/R/V,
   career enlisted aviators (1AXXX AFSC), and nonrated aircrew (K-, Q-, or X-prefixed AFSC)
   personnel responsible for the safe ground and flight operation of the MDS and onboard
   systems, or for airborne duties essential to accomplishment of the MDS-specific mission (ref
   AFPD 11-4) require AP training. Per AFI 11-202 vol. 1, personnel who are delinquent in
   physiological training will not be scheduled for flight duty.
   2.1.2. High Altitude Parachutists. All battlefield airmen: 1T2, 1C2, 1C4, 13D, 13C
   personnel participating in parachute operations above 10,000 feet MSL as required by
   MAJCOM, Air Force, US Army or US Navy directives. AP training should not be used as a
   screening tool for Free Fall Course selection.
   2.1.3. AOP personnel in AFSC 43A and 4M0 must maintain physiological training currency
   IAW this instruction.
   2.1.4. Aircrew Flight Equipment Personnel IAW AFI 11-301, Aircrew Flight Equipment
   (AFE) Program.
   2.1.5. Officer Cadet Initial Training. USAFA and ROTC cadets participating in an AF
   flying program. Civil Air Patrol members are eligible to receive US Air Force physiological
   training when the AOPTU‘s operations group commander authorizes training. The minimum
   age for all non-military training trainees is 18; comply with the state‘s age requirement when
   more restrictive.
   2.1.6. Contractor aircrew, to include mission crew and flight test engineers, required by US
   Government contract to maintain AP training currency as government furnished training.
   Training must be scheduled by the contract government quality assurance evaluator (QAE) or
   government flight representative (GFR) after verifying the government‘s responsibility to
   provide physiological training to the contractor. Contractor aircrew who complete
   physiology training receive a five year currency.
   2.1.7. Civilian Distinguished Visitors (DVs). All requests for physiological training of DVs
   must be coordinated with appropriate OG, MAJCOM/A3 and AF/A3O-AI OPRs through the
   commensurate Public Affairs office in support of approved PA programs. The local wing
   commander may authorize training for civilians when required for military orientation
   flights. Physiological training of distinguished visitors should be associated with a pending
   aircraft flight or other mission-oriented purpose due to the high risk nature of exposure to
   reduced partial pressures and/or barometric pressure changes during the training course.
   2.1.8. Rated aircrew flying in their non-primary MDS must meet pre-flight training
   requirements in AFI 11-202 vol. 3. Flight surgeons and AOP officers, where available, will
   provide a briefing on MDS-specific human factor threats, use of oxygen equipment, and
   acceleration forces, if applicable. ROBD may be used to reinforce hypoxia symptoms but
   will not refresh AP training currency unless accompanied by a complete academic course and
   completion of all ROBD training objectives.
 10                                                           AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012


   2.1.9. Orientation flyers per AFI 11-401 must meet pre-flight training requirements in AFI
   11-202 vol. 3. Additionally, flight surgeons and AOP officers, where available, will provide
   a briefing on hypoxia, use of oxygen equipment, trapped gas/valsalva maneuver, airsickness
   prevention, and acceleration forces, if applicable, no earlier than 72 hours prior to flight. If
   72 hours are exceeded before flight, training will be re-accomplished. ROBD may be used to
   familiarize trainees with their hypoxia symptoms and provide training in oxygen system use
   as available if trainees are medically cleared. ROBD familiarization may not negatively
   impact aircrew and parachutist AP training schedules.
   2.1.10. All other personnel requesting AP training must coordinate approval through
   AETC/A3FM.
2.2. AP Training Requirements.
   2.2.1. General. AOPTUs will schedule any aircrew member or parachutist requesting
   training, regardless of MAJCOM or location; however, schedulers should assist these
   individuals in scheduling training at a closer AOPTU. To ensure efficiency and encourage
   MDS specificity for the students, AP courses have been built to group aircrew and
   parachutists into common aircraft platforms. AP courseware will be posted on the AETC
   Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT) Bookstore for instructor use. Use Course Change
   Request form to request changes via AETC/A3FM Workflow email at
   aetc.a3fm.workflow@us.af.mil. Requests for access to the AETC Flying Training Special
   Publications site (e-BOOKSTORE) may be made on the site itself at
   https://trss3.randolph.af.mil/bookstore/home/homePage.aspx. Requests for courseware
   release must be requested via the AETC/A3FM Workflow email address. Courseware will
   not be released without approval from AETC/A3FM.
   2.2.2. Initial Physiological Training. Rated officer aircrew, career enlisted aircrew, non-
   rated aircrew, parachutists, and AOP personnel will accomplish initial physiological training
   as part of their undergraduate flying training, flying specialty, or AFSC-granting formal
   training program. Training components are outlined in those flying training and formal
   course syllabi and must as a minimum meet Table 3.1 requirements.
      2.2.2.1. Battlefield airmen (1T2, 1C2, 1C4, 13D, 13C) and High Altitude Parachutists
      will receive High Altitude Parachutist initial and refresher training. For High Altitude
      Parachutists, initial physiological training should be completed after selection for
      attendance to a Military Freefall Course and before formal course entry.
      2.2.2.2. Cadets may receive specialized initial physiology academics as long as time
      required and scheduling does not interfere with aircrew AP training. For USAFA cadets
      and ROTC cadets, ROBD may be used in conjunction with academics if available/to the
      maximum extent possible. Cadet training is current through duration of cadet status.
      EXCEPTION: For cadets flying in ejection seat aircraft, oxygen system and egress
      training will be provided IAW MAJCOM/local wing policy prior to flight.
      2.2.2.3. Written tests are required of all initial students. Students need a score of at least
      80 percent to pass. The student should review all missed questions with an instructor and
      verbally correct them to 100 percent. Scores below 80 percent require more instruction
      and retest. An AOP Officer certifies satisfactory training using AF Form 1274,
      Physiological Training, upon satisfactory test completion. Report personnel who
AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                   11


     demonstrate inadequate knowledge of the instructed subject to their unit commanders and
     arrange for them to repeat the course of instruction.
  2.2.3. Transition Physiological Training. Transition physiological training is required for
  all rated officer aircrew and career enlisted aviator personnel attending a formal weapon
  system qualification training course in transition to a new aircraft. The purpose of this
  training is to provide weapon system and mission-specific human factors and update oxygen
  system emergency procedures training, not necessarily to refresh hypoxia symptoms (or
  provide a ―chamber re-hack‖).        Helicopter aircrew and other aircrew completing
  requalification training IAW AFI 11-202 vol. 1 para. 2.2 are not required to re-complete
  transition physiological training.
     2.2.3.1. Lead MAJCOMs and weapon system Formal Training Units (FTU), to include
     remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) FTUs, will ensure physiological training addresses the
     MDS-specific physiological and human performance challenges. As a minimum, non-
     RPA FTU students will receive training in the following mission/MDS-applied topics:
     human factors of displays, automation and helmet-mounted cueing systems, cabin
     pressurization and oxygen system effects on human performance, attention management
     threats to situational awareness, and spatial disorientation (to include night vision
     systems), protection in high-G environments, and fatigue and circadian rhythm
     management. As a minimum, RPA FTU students will receive training in human factors
     of displays (to include visual effects in low light), automation and cueing systems,
     situational awareness, sensor management, spatial disorientation, and fatigue and
     circadian rhythm management.
     2.2.3.2. Oxygen system failure and hypoxia emergency procedures training must be
     conducted prior to first flight in the aircraft for MDSs whose oxygen system/equipment
     and emergency procedures differ from those taught in the altitude chamber during initial
     physiological training. For example, if a B-1 pilot transitions to become a T-6A or a T-
     38C Instructor Pilot, he/she must undergo oxygen system failure and hypoxia emergency
     procedures training as part of the appropriate Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) formal
     course due to significant differences in the oxygen equipment and hypoxia emergency
     procedures training.
     2.2.3.3. At FTU locations where ROBDs are used for aircrew hypoxia recognition and
     emergency procedures training as part of the formal training course, refresher training
     may be annotated if concurrently accompanied by refresher academics, shifting the
     refresher requirement to 5 years from the end of the month during which the ROBD
     training was accomplished.
  2.2.4. Refresher Physiological Training. Refresher training will be conducted IAW this
  instruction and the appropriate syllabus as developed by AETC/A3FM. Training guidance
  will undergo annual review.
     2.2.4.1. For rated officer aircrew, career enlisted aviators, non-rated aircrew, AOP
     personnel and High Altitude Parachutists, refresher training must be completed no later
     than 5 years from the end of the month during which initial or transition level AP training
     was accomplished (IAW para. 2.2.2.3). With the exception of some Track E refresher
     students (see para 2.2.4.8), all refresher students must complete hypoxia exposure via
     altitude chamber or ROBD regardless of number of years of flying service. Personnel
12                                                         AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012


     exempt under prior 20 years of aviation service exception in the 2001 version of this
     instruction are not required to retrain immediately upon publishing of the update but must
     receive hypoxia exposure during their next AP refresher training session. Refresher
     training currency must be maintained with the same 5 year frequency. For example, if an
     aircrew member completes their initial AP training on 21 Aug 2012, their refresher
     training is due 31 Aug 2017. The MAJCOM/A3 may establish more frequent MDS-
     specific training requirements as appropriate. Reference aircraft-specific 11-series
     publications and MAJCOM supplements for more information on these additional
     training requirements.
     2.2.4.2. Types of Refreshers. Refresher course categories are grouped based upon
     common aircraft characteristics. All refresher training will emphasize aircraft-specific
     oxygen equipment re-familiarization and emergency procedures.
     2.2.4.3. Track A (formerly Trainer, Attack, Reconnaissance, Fighter - TARF): For
     aircrew who fly in ejection seat-equipped aircraft such as trainer, bomber/attack, fighter
     or C4ISR, except for aircrew flying U-2 (see para 2.2.5).
     2.2.4.4. Track T (formerly Tanker, Transport, Bomber - TTB): For aircrew who fly in
     tanker and transport aircraft and those manned C2ISR aircraft who do not fly with
     ejection seats.
     2.2.4.5. Track H (formerly Helicopter - HELO): For aircrew who fly in helicopters.
     2.2.4.6. Track C: For aircrew who fly CV-22 aircraft. If CV-22 academics are not
     available, USAF CV-22 aircrew may attend either a Track T or H course.
     2.2.4.7. Track J (formerly High Altitude Parachutist - HAP): For parachutists who have
     previously completed initial physiological training and are MFF qualified.
     2.2.4.8. Track E (formerly Executive - EXEC): For E-9 Command Chief (or higher) or
     O-6 Group Commander (or higher) rated aircrew members or parachutists. Academic
     training as a minimum must include the following topics: attention management threats to
     situational awareness, spatial disorientation, g-induced loss of consciousness (for fighter
     aircrew) and a review of altitude threats to performance tailored to the students‘
     experience level. A chamber flight to demonstrate hypoxia is not required for members
     with more than three documented refreshers. ROBD should be used where available.
     Refer to MAJCOM supplements or MDS-series guidance for required hypoxia
     recognition/recovery training. EXEC training candidates deployed for 180 days or more
     may request a Video Teleconference class if an AOP is not able to ensure training.
     2.2.4.9. Track R. For Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) aircrew. Consists only of
     refresher academics on human factors such as fatigue, attention management threats to
     situational awareness, including displays and automation challenges, and spatial
     disorientation. No altitude chamber or ROBD training is required.
  2.2.5. Pressure Suit Training. Conduct pressure suit training and support for personnel
  who fly U-2 aircraft.
     2.2.5.1. Original Pressure Suit Training. A one-time requirement provided upon initial
     assembly and fitting of the pressure suit assembly. Reference ACCI 11-459, High-
AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                      13


       Altitude Reconnaissance Mission Support Program, for course entry criteria and specific
       training requirements.
       2.2.5.2. Refresher Pressure Suit Training. Required every 5 years for those who have
       undergone original pressure suit training. Course content will meet the requirements of a
       Track A refresher course, and provide pressure suit and routine refresher training
       simultaneously with emphasis on both the high altitude and companion trainer aircraft.
2.3. Medical Requirements for AP Training. Individuals must have the appropriate medical
clearance to be eligible for physiological training. See paragraphs 2.3.2 - 2.3.3 for medical
clearance documentation requirements. Trainees who have colds, sinusitis, headaches,
abdominal pain, digestive upset, ear trouble, pregnancy, and injuries are typically excluded from
hypobaric chamber training. AP training is waived during pregnancy until aircrew are returned
to flight status. To assure training safety, a local flight surgeon will assess a trainee‘s medical
clearance if questions arise; telephone consult by on-call flight surgeon is acceptable but will be
documented by AOP personnel. Trainees who have donated blood in the last 72 hours cannot
participate in chamber flights. Local on-call flight surgeon will be the approval authority for
chamber flight participation of trainees with operational requirements for beards or mustaches
which interfere with a safe oxygen mask fit. In coordination with the flight surgeon, the
AOPTU/CC may refuse training to any individual who does not appear to have the physical
health or attitude commensurate with high-risk physiological training.
   2.3.1. Chamber Flight Exposures after Diving. Personnel must delay altitude chamber
   and aerial flight exposures for at least 24 hours following dive events. This includes
   compressed air or mixed gas diving, surface supplied diving, or hyperbaric exposure. If the
   dive requires a decompression stop, then 48 hours must elapse prior to altitude chamber
   exposure. EXCEPTION: Special Operations personnel may follow guidelines per the US
   Navy Diving Manuals.
   2.3.2. US and Foreign Military, Service Academy/ROTC Cadets or Midshipmen, or
   Government Service Civilians. Copy of AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for
   Flying or Special Operational Duty, DA (Army) Form 4186, Medical Recommendation for
   Flying Duty, or Naval Medical Form 6410/2, Clearance Notice (Aeromedical), indicating
   that a flying class I, II, or III physical has been completed. US Coast Guard, Department of
   the Navy, and US Army personnel may present any of the forms previously listed. North
   Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other foreign military personnel may use the local
   current base clearance or annual physical 1042 prepared by home station flight surgeons
   based on the standards of medical fitness for flying duties issued by the parent country (IAW
   AFI 48-123). Clearances will have a specific expiration date ensuring the trainee is
   medically cleared through the duration of training. Medical clearances for ―physiological
   training only‖ will be accepted for training participation and may be provided by the flight
   surgeon for foreign military personnel. In the absence of written medical clearance,
   telephone verification with the trainee's home medical facility is authorized. Print or type the
   name of the person who verified the clearance, clearing flight surgeon, and clearance
   expiration on the flight recorder sheet for that day‘s training.
   2.3.3. Government Contractors, Non-DoD Government Civilians and Non-Government
   Civilians (to include DVs). Government contractors and non-government civilian personnel
   to include DVs undergoing USAF physiological training must present a copy of current
 14                                                              AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012


   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Medical Certificate flying class I, II or III. The
   AOPTU/CC is responsible for interpreting the relative health risks of civilians attending
   physiological training and may refuse to provide training IAW para. 2.3 of this instruction.
2.4. Exceptions to AP Training.
   2.4.1. Department of the Navy or US Coast Guard aircrew personnel, who have current AP
   training in their service, are not required to complete a full USAF AP training course before
   their first flight in USAF aircraft. US Army aircrew require additional training, specifically
   para. 3.2.4, 3.2.12, and 3.2.11, if flying in fighter or bomber aircraft, prior to their first flight
   in USAF aircraft. Prior to first flight, all rated aircrew from any other services must receive a
   briefing on the oxygen equipment and emergency procedures as part of requirements in AFI
   11-202 vol. 1. For flight in fighter aircraft, refer to AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for
   High-G Aircrew, for additional acceleration training requirements. AOP Officers will sign
   an AF Form 1274 after verifying prior training documents and completion of additional
   training requirements.
   2.4.2. Prior to first flight, all rated aircrew from other countries must receive a briefing on
   the oxygen system procedures and ejection seat procedures if applicable as part of
   requirements in AFI 11-202 vol. 1. For flight in fighter aircraft, refer to AFI 11-404 for
   additional acceleration training requirements. Foreign flying personnel who have current AP
   training from their country are not required to take USAF training before their first flight in
   USAF aircraft if their country's AP training program has been approved for unconditional
   acceptance. Training documentation must be in English, legible, and certified by the correct
   training official from foreign country. AOP personnel will generate an AF Form 1274 to
   document AP training currency upon receipt of complete training documentation. Requests
   for foreign AP training documentation clarification should be forwarded to the base
   International Military Student Officer (IMSO) or AFSAT/DO via AFSAT Workflow email if
   there is no base IMSO.
       2.4.2.1. Aircrew trained in countries with no or expired approval must complete USAF
       AP refresher training prior to their first flight in USAF aircraft. Use Invitational Travel
       Order (ITO) as primary document requiring an individual to obtain USAF AP training;
       contact AFSAT/DO with courtesy copy to AETC/A3FM to verify training is required and
       will be resourced for foreign personnel not on ITOs. Student identification number listed
       on the ITO will be used in completion of AP training documentation (AF Form 1274 or
       MFR). Full refresher course must include the oxygen system and ejection seat
       procedures brief required by AFI 11-202 vol. 1. The list of approved foreign AP training
       programs can be found on the AETC/A3F page of the Air Force Portal.
       2.4.2.2. Requests for USAF approval of foreign country AP training should be initiated
       through the appropriate country manager at SAF/IA and/or AFSAT/DO, who will
       coordinate with AETC/A3FM to review the training program. Upon request from
       SAF/IA and/or AFSAT/DO, AETC/A3FM will identify the best qualified AOP personnel
       to review the requesting country‘s AP training program. Two person teams (consisting of
       field grade 43A3 and 4M071) will complete in-country approval visits after establishing
       courseware similarity; re-certifications may be accomplished via courseware review only.
       SAF/IA will prioritize and coordinate with AFSAT to fund for country approval requests.
       AETC/A3FM will provide guidance and standardized evaluation checklists to the
AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                   15


     reviewer(s) to support this process. The reviewer(s) will provide a written summary of
     their findings and recommendations to AETC/A3FM, who will then forward the
     recommendation and supporting documentation to AETC/A3F for approval of
     unconditional acceptance. NOTE: Foreign country AP training programs must be
     reviewed every 5 years via this same coordination process.
  2.4.3. Aircrew who are within 4 months of approved separation or retirement, assigned to a
  non-flying position or are placed in an inactive status for administrative or medical reasons,
  are not required to maintain currency in physiological training.
  2.4.4. All flying personnel assigned to an active flying assignment overseas with no ROBD
  refresher capability must complete refresher physiological training prior to departure from
  home station.
  2.4.5. Requalification. Any person who has completed original/initial physiology training
  may requalify in AP training by taking the appropriate refresher course for their current
  flying duties.
  2.4.6. Aircrew required to wear pressure suits for high altitude operations complete refresher
  training every 5 years as described in para 2.2.5.2 of this instruction.

                     AEROSPACE PHYSIOLOGY TRAINING CONTENT

  3.1. General. The purpose of AP Training is to provide aircrew and parachutists the
  knowledge, skills and attitudes to optimize performance in physiologically and cognitively
  challenging air and space operations. AP training systems provide a training environment that
  replicates high altitude, high-G, egress, and orientation-compromised exposures in which
  personnel can apply preventive countermeasures and practice emergency procedures. By
  providing academic lessons followed by hands-on application in a controlled environment,
  student learning is maximized while minimizing risk exposure. Only AP instructors who are
  graduates of an approved USAF Academic Instructor Course are authorized to teach AP
  instructional blocks. Instructors will supplement their academic courseware with mishap lessons
  learned and trend information. Table 3.1 illustrates required lessons and training events required
  to complete AP training.

training requirement. Cadets who complete commissioning and selection to an aircrew training
pipeline will re-accomplish initial training. During aircrew pipeline training, these trainees will
experience a full initial and rapid decompression chamber flight as a portion of their required training.

  3.2. Academic Lessons. Qualified AOP personnel will conduct presentation of the standardized
  curriculum IAW syllabi standards. Individuals who have attained a primary AFSC of 4M071 or
  higher, and an Associate‘s Degree or higher may be certified by the local AOPTU/CC to teach
  the subjects listed in paragraph 3.2.1 and 3.2.5. Individuals who have attained a primary AFSC
  of 4M071 or higher, hold an Associate‘s Degree or higher, and have experience in High Altitude
  Airdrop Mission Support (HAAMS) operations or qualified as a parachutist, may also be
  qualified to teach initial and/or refresher (Track J) HAP training. The local AOPTU/CC must
  provide these technicians additional, comprehensive training to teach the subjects listed in
  paragraph 3.2.1., 3.2.2., 3.2.5., 3.2.6., 3.2.8, 3.2.10. This additional training must be documented
  in the individual's OJT record.
      3.2.1. Physiological Effects of Altitude. Physics of the atmosphere; anatomy and physiology
      and effects of the flight environment on circulation and respiration, to include smoke and
      fumes; the physiology, causes, prevention, recognition and recovery of hypoxia and
      hyperventilation, trapped and evolved gas.
      3.2.2. Performance Threats. Self and mission-imposed threats applied to the flight
      environment: alcohol, temperature extremes, performance nutrition, dehydration, over-the-
      counter medications, dietary supplements, fatigue, circadian rhythms and physical fitness.

      emphasis is placed on HAP oxygen systems.
      3.2.4. Cabin Pressurization and Decompression. Principles of cabin pressurization, physical
      and physiological consequences of decompression, as well as the procedures to be followed
      after cabin decompression.
      3.2.5. Pressure Breathing. The need for pressure breathing, its limitations, proper
      techniques, precautions, and potential problems. This block will include F-22 ground
      pressure breathing initial or refresher academics, if applicable.
      3.2.6. Vision. Basic anatomy of the visual system, physiology of day and night vision,
      factors affecting vision, dark adaptation, scanning methods and lasers. Instruction on lasers
      should include, at a minimum, hazards of lasers and reporting laser incidents or accidents to
      meet AFI 11-301 Volume 4, Aircrew Laser Eye Protection, requirements. Unaided night
      vision academics will be conducted in conjunction with an unaided night vision training
      system.
      3.2.7. Spatial Disorientation. Human sensory systems used for orientation, illusions derived
      from vision, semicircular canals, otolith organs, and proprioceptive system, types and
      characteristics of spatial disorientation, motion sickness, the role that situational awareness
      and the instrument crosscheck play in prevention, recognition and recovery from spatial

   disorientation. For initial students, this academic session will be followed by disorientation
   demonstration using the Barany Chair or other AETC-approved disorientation trainer.
   3.2.8. Noise and Vibration. Basic anatomy and physiology of hearing for initial trainees
   only. Sources and harmful effects of exposure to hazardous noise and vibration and methods
   used to reduce and/or control exposure.
   3.2.9. Principles of Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). Concepts of CRM to
   include basic terminology and CRM tools for undergraduate flying training pipeline students
   as directed by AETC syllabi.
   3.2.10. Attention Management Threats to Situational Awareness (AMT-SA). Attention
   management threats to cognitive performance, decision-making, motivation, concepts of SA,
   and techniques of maintaining/regaining SA applied to mishap prevention such as spatial
   disorientation, GLOC, and task management problems.
   3.2.11. Acceleration. Aeromedical aspects of high speed flight, aircraft ejection, and visual
   problems, including physical and physiological effects of acceleration and techniques used to
   raise G-tolerance and endurance. The Anti-G Straining Maneuver will be discussed and
   demonstrated. This course is required for all personnel flying in high-g aircraft.
   3.2.12. Aircraft Egress. Physiological principles and problems of escape associated with
   different conditions of altitude and velocity. Initial trainees flying in ejection seat aircraft
   will receive seat training if available at the local AOPTU. Covers the principles of crash
   survival and the care/use of the parachute, parachute control, and parachute landing
   techniques if required by MAJCOM supplement or UFT syllabi. UFT and CSO egress
   covers ground egress and ejection seat procedures IAW applicable syllabus.
3.3. Training Devices. Safety and training effectiveness are paramount. Operate all AP
training devices IAW this instruction and local unit Operating Instructions. Local unit
instructions will follow AFOSH and other applicable safety standards. Use of the physiology
training devices for experimental, non-training activities is not approved, with the exception of
AFRL-owned hypobaric chambers designated solely for research. Practical training using
devices is optimally delivered immediately following academic instruction. Practical training
using AP training devices will occur no later than 90 days following academic instruction.
   3.3.1. Altitude Chamber. Operating instructions for AP training are listed in Attachment 2.
   Medical evaluation flights require direct supervision of the attending flight surgeon to
   include designation of flight profile requirements needed to evaluate patients. Medical
   evaluation flights will not interfere with operational training or expose any person inside the
   chamber to altitudes at or above FL250 for more than 30 minutes or above FL180 for more
   than 1 hour due to the increased risk for decompression sickness. Minimum crew
   complement requirements and inside observer exposure limits apply to this non-training use
   of the chamber.
       3.3.1.1. The altitude (hypobaric) chamber provides a training system which replicates the
       effects of barometric pressure change on the human body. This includes the exposure to
       low barometric pressure environment for recognition of personal hypoxia symptoms as
       well as physical effects of pressure change at various training altitudes. The ability to
       simulate an aircraft rapid decompression is a valuable initial training experience of the
       altitude chamber for all aircrew and parachutists. Full pressure suit chamber training and
AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                   19


     profiles are discussed in ACCI 11-459, High-Altitude Reconnaissance Mission Support
     Program.
     3.3.1.2. The altitude chamber is a required component for all initial physiological
     training. Cadets are authorized to use ROBD for training (see note 3 of Table 3.1). For
     those personnel identified in para. 2.1.1-2.1.4. and 2.1.6, it is an acceptable training
     system for refresher requirements.
     3.3.1.3. Trainees will receive chamber flight pre-brief and post-briefings prior to and
     following the training system event. Training units will regularly debrief training events
     with all available personnel. Lessons learned will be documented via instructor meeting
     minutes and used as applicable in future training for instructor/inside observer upgrades
     or quarterly emergency training sessions. Lessons learned may be submitted to
     AETC/A3FM for use as a training resource for other AOPTUs.
        3.3.1.3.1. Altitude Chamber Pre-flight Briefing. At minimum, all students will be
        briefed on the following topics prior to altitude chamber training. Ensure students are
        not suffering from any type of illness or issues that would prohibit participation in a
        chamber flight.
        3.3.1.3.2. Ensure students understand the following chamber flight objectives:
            3.3.1.3.2.1. Accomplishing all steps for complete hypoxia recovery.
            3.3.1.3.2.2. Exhibit proper techniques to combat mechanical effects of pressure
            change for ear, sinus and gas expansion.
            3.3.1.3.2.3. Demonstrate proper oxygen equipment discipline and in-flight
            oxygen checks.
            3.3.1.3.2.4. Identify and use emergency/portable oxygen equipment.
            3.3.1.3.2.5. Recognize and correct night vision deficiencies resulting from
            decreased oxygen.
            3.3.1.3.2.6. Determine physical indication and physiological effects of a rapid
            decompression, only required for initial trainees.
        3.3.1.3.3. . Ensure trainees understand when, how, and why to use the ―Level Off‖
        hand signal.
        3.3.1.3.4. Ensure trainees know the steps to perform an effective valsalva maneuver.
     3.3.1.4. Personnel who have participated in an altitude chamber flight are restricted from
     physical exercise, strenuous or extended duty for a period of 12 hours. Additionally,
     personnel may fly as crew member or passenger after a chamber flight to 25,000 feet or
     below but should remain below a cabin altitude of 15,000 feet for 24 hours after
     exposure.
     3.3.1.5. Because not all chamber reactions meet safety reporting criteria, chamber
     reactions will be tracked using the grading scale in Table 3.2. and the anatomical location
     of the reaction (right ear, abdominal pain, etc). AOPTUs will review reaction data for
     trends as appropriate, but no less than once per quarter, and include this information in
     instructor training meetings monthly and annual reports as required. Units will not
 20                                                           AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012


        maintain any health or privacy act information on reactions, only information useful in
        identifying and documenting trends. All confirmed DCS cases must be reported to the
        local Wing Safety Office.

Table 3.2. Chamber Reactor Grading Scale.
Grade                                             Description
  1       Requires no level-off or change in flight profile. Treatment is limited to verbal inquiry
          or instruction only. An example of a grade 1 reaction would be instructing someone to
          valsalva on descent if they complain of fullness in their ear and valsalva results in
          alleviation of the problem.
  2       Interrupts flight profile or levels chamber. An example of a grade 2 reaction would be
          a level of the chamber to resolve an ear problem or an increase of up to 2,000 feet (also
          known as a bounce) of the chamber to relieve ear pain.
  3       Requires removal from the chamber and/or placed on 100% oxygen for observation
          without hospitalization. DCS symptoms are classified as at least a grade 3 reaction.
          Includes most reactions requiring flight surgeon consult. An example of grade 3 would
          be removal of a student from the chamber due to gas pains at altitude or administering
          surface level oxygen for suspected DCS.
  4       Requires admission to the hospital or treatment in the hyperbaric chamber. All Grade 4
          reactions require flight surgeon consult and must be reported to the local Wing Safety
          Office.
        3.3.1.6. Altitude Chamber Post-flight Briefing. At minimum, all students will be
        briefed on the following topics following altitude chamber training
           3.3.1.6.1. Students will not participate in physical exercise, strenuous activity or
           extended duty for a period of 12 hours.
           3.3.1.6.2. Students may fly as crewmembers or passengers after a chamber flight to
           25,000 feet or below but should remain below a cabin altitude of 15,000 feet.
           3.3.1.6.3. Students should perform periodic valsalva maneuvers throughout the
           day/evening to prevent delayed ear blocks.
           3.3.1.6.4. Students should avoid alcohol consumption for 12 hours after a hypobaric
           exposure. Alcohol can mask DCS symptoms, and dehydration can increase DCS risk.
           3.3.1.6.5. Students should monitor their fatigue level and avoid driving great
           distances without proper rest after a hypobaric exposure.
           3.3.1.6.6. Provide students contact information and procedures to report suspected
           DCS while in the local area, outside the local area, and after hours.
   3.3.2. ROBD. Operating instructions for AP training are listed in Attachment 3.
        3.3.2.1. The ROBD is a training system that provides hypoxia recognition and
        emergency procedures training using normobaric reduced oxygen gas mixtures. ROBD
        training requires the student to wear their primary oxygen equipment in order to deliver
        the reduced oxygen gas mixture to the trainee and is often referred to as ‗Mask-On‘
        hypoxia training. It is designed to be used in conjunction with aircraft flight simulators
        or Hypoxia Familiarization Trainers (HFT-C or HFT-M) so that the MDS-specific
AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                 21


     oxygen systems emergency procedures are concurrent to that of the aircraft. ROBD
     training will be accomplished using an approved training plan. Trainees will receive
     ROBD pre-brief and post-briefings prior to and following the training system event.
     3.3.2.2. The ROBD may be used in transition physiological training when oxygen
     system emergency procedural differences training is required as part of the FTU syllabus.
     If used, every attempt should be made to use the ROBD in conjunction with the aircraft
     flight simulation/training system. When the flight simulator is not available, use of an
     appropriately configured HFT is authorized. Part task trainers or flight task simulations
     may be used if an HFT is not appropriate for the crew member‘s flight duties and flight
     simulators cannot be used; refer to the approved training plan. MAJCOM AP training
     PMs will develop and maintain a list of MDS/crew position/approved alternative training
     simulations reviewed by AETC/A3FM and approved by the MAJCOM/A3. Updated
     copies of approved device listings must be maintained in the MAJCOM supplement to
     this publication or in an MFR documenting approved devices maintained in the AP Read
     File, Tab 3 (see para 6.6).
     3.3.2.3. The ROBD should be used for all refresher aircrew whose aircraft oxygen
     systems and emergency procedures are not adequately represented in the altitude
     chamber. Examples include: CV-22, B-2, B-1, F-22A, and the F-35.
     3.3.2.4. For all other aircrew, a ROBD is an approved replacement for the altitude
     chamber during refresher training as long as the appropriate oxygen system configuration
     is available and the training scenarios are appropriate for their MDS. Trainees will
     receive ROBD flight pre-brief and post-briefings prior to and following the training
     system event.
     3.3.2.5. ROBD Pre-flight Briefing. At minimum, all trainees will be briefed on the
     following topics before completing ROBD training.
        3.3.2.5.1. Provide students with an ROBD orientation.
        3.3.2.5.2. Describe the following training objectives:
            3.3.2.5.2.1. Experience hypoxia while in a simulated flight/mission environment.
            3.3.2.5.2.2. Perform the appropriate hypoxia emergency procedures without
            assistance.
            3.3.2.5.2.3. Demonstrate correct positive pressure breathing technique during
            emergency oxygen activation, if supplemental pressure is used.
            3.3.2.5.2.4. Demonstrate proper pre-flight, in-flight, emergency, and post flight
            equipment configuration checks.
            3.3.2.5.2.5. Recognize and correct night vision deficiencies resulting from
            decreased oxygen.
            3.3.2.5.2.6. Recognize the negative effect of hypoxia on effectively completing
            mission-related duties.
        3.3.2.5.3. Review the ROBD profile and simulator, HFT or part task trainer scenario
        as appropriate.

     3.3.2.6. ROBD Post-flight Briefing. At minimum, all students will be briefed on the
     following topics following ROBD training.
         3.3.2.6.1. Advise students to contact a flight surgeon or emergency treatment facility
         in the event unusual symptoms occur after the completion of ROBD training.
         3.3.2.6.2. Advise students that there are no aircrew, jump, or passenger flight
         restrictions placed on personnel following ROBD training.
         3.3.2.6.3. Students should monitor their fatigue level and avoid driving great
         distances without proper rest after ROBD training.
  3.3.3. Hypoxia Familiarization Trainer (HFT). The HFT provides a flight task simulation
  for use in conjunction with an ROBD during which the aircrew can undergo hypoxia
  recognition and oxygen system emergency procedures training. Two configurations are
  available, the HFT-C or cockpit trainer and the HFT-M for mission crew. Training scenarios
  must enable the aircrew to practice use of the primary and any emergency or alternate
  oxygen systems. This can include the ‗Quick-Don‘ mask, the MA-1 portable oxygen
  assembly, the emergency oxygen system associated with fighter aircraft and passenger
  oxygen kits. Operating instructions for aircrew training are listed in Attachment 4.
  3.3.4. Barany Chair. The Barany Chair is used as introductory spatial disorientation
  demonstrator and for rotational training as part of the airsickness management program.
  Operating instructions for aircrew training are listed in Attachment 5.
  3.3.5. Unaided Night Vision Trainer. The unaided night vision trainer is used during
  initial physiological training to demonstrate unaided night vision limitations. It is also used
  to provide visual acuity demonstration to Track J refresher students during ROBD training.
  Operating instructions for AP training are listed in Attachment 6.
  3.3.6. Other Training Devices. Some AP training devices are used solely within a specific
  MAJCOM. Guidance for these devices will be provided via MAJCOM supplement to this
  publication. Configuration control will be maintained by AETC/A3FM even for devices
  used by only one MAJCOM. If devices are purchased for use by other MAJCOMs, then
  device guidance will be issued via a change to this publication.

          OTHER AIRCREW TRAINING SUPPORTED BY AOP PERSONNEL

4.1. General. The purpose of AP training is to provide aircrew the knowledge, skills and
abilities to optimize performance in physiologically and cognitively challenging aerospace
operations. AOP personnel maintain a unique skill set that can be beneficial to many programs.
This chapter will detail some widely supported aircrew training programs and quantify AOP
personnel support to those programs. This chapter is not intended to be an all inclusive list of
AOP capabilities, nor is it intended as an exclusive list of AP training activities. Rather, this
chapter is intended to provide standardization among AOP personnel regarding their support of
requirements driven by other instructions. The originating AFIs and their MAJCOM
supplements describe programs independent of AP training as well as critical program execution
details. These AFIs will be referenced fully before AOP personnel support these other training
programs as they supersede any clarifying guidance provided in this instruction.
4.2. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Training. Per AFI 11-202 vol. 1, NVG training will be
conducted by certified instructors. AOP personnel may support initial and refresher training as
allowed by MAJCOM instruction. AOP personnel must meet any qualification requirements
established by AFI 11-202 and 11-2-MDS series guidance.
4.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM). AOP personnel will have familiarity with
CRM concepts and review CRM courseware at their wing for redundancies with AP training
materials IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program. Per
MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-290, AOP personnel may complete CRM Facilitator training
and serve as CRM Instructors/Facilitators.
4.4. Anti-G Strain Maneuver (AGSM) Reviews. AOP officers will conduct HUD video
reviews or provide AGSM academic refresher required for fighter aircrew as directed by the
specific 11-2-MDS series publications. Increased security clearance requirements may be
required and should be facilitated per para 1.4.6.2.3 of this instruction.
4.5. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC). AOP officers should provide spatial disorientation
and attention management threats to situational awareness briefings relevant to wing operations
during required IRC training IAW AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program.
4.6. Squadron and Wing Safety Briefings. AOP personnel should provide briefings on
performance threats or other AP training topics to support quarterly flight safety and other

                                 DEVICE MANAGEMENT

5.1. General. AETC/A2/3/10 serves as Lead Command for all AP training program devices.
AETC/A3FM coordinates with the AP Training Devices SPO to ensure configuration
management for all AP training devices per AFPD 10-9. AOPTU personnel are responsible for
local management of AP training devices, and will ensure all technical manuals/orders,
associated checklists, and procedures are properly followed for storage, operation and
maintenance.
5.2. Device Status Reporting. Device utilization and maintenance information for the
preceding month will be reported to AETC/A3FM via the AETC/A3FM Sharepoint site no later
than the 10th day of each month after review by respective MDG (if required), OG and
MAJCOM/A3 and MAJCOM/SG AP POCs. AETC/A3FM will compile and provide usage data
annually to HQ USAF/A3O-AI and the SPO IAW para 6.3 of this instruction.
   5.2.1. Units providing AP training will notify AETC/A3FM and their respective wing and
   MAJCOM SG and A3 AP POCs when AP training devices are non-operational due to
   maintenance or otherwise not an available training option for wing trainees within 24 hours
   of non-operational status.
5.3. Device Maintenance. Maintenance not detailed within the appropriate technical manuals
will not be accomplished unless authorized by the SPO via AETC/A3FM. NOTE: All personnel
will comply with technical orders and manuals in accomplishing maintenance.
   5.3.1. Altitude chamber discrepancies are to be handled by AP personnel to the maximum
   extent possible using proper Technical Orders (TOs) and procedures.
      5.3.1.1. If a problem is encountered that is not addressed by a TO or is beyond the scope
      of local expertise, contact AETC/A3FM for information on contacting altitude chamber
      contract maintenance or obtaining SPO direction on maintenance of other AP devices.
      5.3.1.2. Contractors may request photographs or additional information on local issue to
      provide help desk support. This information should be provided as quickly as possible to
      ensure rapid help desk support. Chamber units are not expected to furnish computer
      support to contractors during site visits but are requested to support base access on behalf
      of the contract team. Repair parts will be purchased by the chamber unit as available via
      stock list. If there are no stock-listed parts or quantity available is zero, then units will
      notify the contractor who will provide repair parts. Contract repair team‘s response time
      will be based on parts delivery.
      5.3.1.3. If the contractor is required to accomplish maintenance procedures, the team will
      not depart the site until a government acceptance check is complete. The government
      acceptance check is required to verify that the chamber is fully operational after all
      corrective actions are complete. As a minimum, use the daily inspection checklist
      provided by the SPO to verify chamber functionality. Additional functional checks may
      be accomplished at the user‘s discretion. Direct any questions on altitude chambers‘
      contract maintenance to AETC/A3FM.

                 HYPOBARIC CHAMBER OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

A2.1. General.
   A2.1.1. Overview and Description. The altitude (hypobaric) chamber uses a vacuum pump
   based system to replicate the effects of barometric pressure change on the human body. The
   maximum number of students on a chamber flight is the maximum number designed to be
   held by the main chamber for initial or refresher profiles and the lock compartment for rapid
   decompressions.
   A2.1.2. Objectives. Initial students complete initial & rapid decompression flights.
   Refresher students complete only the refresher chamber flight. To successfully complete the
   physiological training requirement, students must complete recovery procedures without
   Inside Observer‘s assistance to physical switch activation. Additional objectives relevant to
   each chamber flight type are listed in A2.2-A2.4.
   A2.1.3. Personnel Requirements and Qualifications. AOP personnel who have completed
   CFETP requirements and have been evaluated in their ability to complete the duties of the
   position and aid chamber reactors and emergencies appropriate for their designated chamber
   position are considered qualified to serve as chamber crew on those positions. Document all
   training via CFETP and final qualifying evaluation on the instructor evaluation form.
      A2.1.3.1. The minimum required crew positions are lecturer, chamber operator, crew
      chief, recorder, lock operator, APO, and the appropriate number of inside observers (IO)
      for number of trainees. Initial classes require one IO for one student, two IOs for 2-10
      students, and three IOs for 11 or more students. Rapid decompressions require one IO
      per flight. Refresher classes require one IO for five or fewer students. Two IOs are
      required for chamber flights with six or more students.
          A2.1.3.1.1. The local on-call flight surgeon will be notified of altitude chamber start
          and completion. During all scheduled training events, a designated flight surgeon
          must continuously be able to be able to respond by telephone and physically to the
          training facility in the timeliest manner possible in the event of a medical incident
          and/or emergency response.
          A2.1.3.1.2. Waivers to provide training using smaller crews (i.e. dual tasking a
          member to two crew positions) must be requested from AETC/A3FM no later than 1
          day prior to providing training.
      A2.1.3.2. Maximum chamber exposure limits for Inside Observers are four flights in a 7-
      day period to 25,000 feet or two rapid decompressions in a 7-day period. These flights
      may be taken in combination. At least 23 hours will be allowed between exposures to
      rapid decompressions and at least 12 hours between exposures to 25,000 feet. The
      chamber exposure levels listed in this chapter are considered the maximum exposures
      permitted.
   A2.1.4. Responsibilities. AOP personnel will provide a pre- and post-flight briefing to all
   students in addition to required physiological training. During the pre-flight briefing, the
   instructor describes the purpose and procedures of the flight and verifies that no trainees have
 34                                                         AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012


   medical complaints rendering them a flight risk during training. Post-flight briefings will
   describe restrictions for personnel who take part in chamber flights, such as no physical
   exercise, strenuous or extended duty for a period of 12 hours; personnel may fly as crew
   member or passenger after a chamber flight to 25,000 feet or below but should remain below
   a cabin altitude of 15,000 feet IAW AFI 11-202 vol. 3.; common post-flight issues such as
   ear blocks and fatigue; and procedures for reporting suspected DCS, to include emergency
   contact numbers. Specific requirements for each profile pre- and post-flight are listed in
   A2.2-A2.4. NOTE: Local AOP leadership is responsible for ensuring all chamber time
   should be used for training activities only; research or equipment check flights for pay are
   not authorized IAW para. 6.2.1.5 of this instruction.
A2.2. Initial Hypobaric Chamber Flight.
   A2.2.1. Initial Hypobaric Chamber Flight Goals. Designed to acquaint initial trainees
   with the overall effects of barometric pressure change and permit them to practice the
   principles and techniques learned in the classroom in the low-pressure flight environment.
   Specific training objectives include trainee experience in:
      A2.2.1.1. The mechanical effects of pressure change (ear, sinus and gas expansion).
      A2.2.1.2. Positive pressure breathing resulting from the loss of cabin pressure in a low-
      pressure environment.
      A2.2.1.3. Applying the techniques and principles learned in the classroom to an
      accidental loss of cabin pressure.
      A2.2.1.4. Hypoxia recognition and treatment in self and others.
      A2.2.1.5. Proper oxygen equipment discipline in a low-pressure environment.
      A2.2.1.6. Use of the emergency oxygen system and portable oxygen equipment.
      A2.2.1.7. Prevention, recognition, and treatment of hyperventilation during various flight
      conditions.
      A2.2.1.8. Visual degradation resulting from decreased oxygen and night flying
      conditions.
      A2.2.1.9. Instilling proper habit patterns, to include proper wear of aircrew flight

   percent oxygen.
   A2.3.3. Simulated Flight in Low-Pressure Chamber Procedures:
AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                    37


     A2.3.3.1. During mask fitting, preflight check of oxygen equipment, and
     intercommunication check, trainees will don oxygen masks with regulator set at "100
     percent oxygen."
     A2.3.3.2. During the ear and sinus check, ascend to 5,000 feet and descend to ground
     level at a rate not to exceed 5,000 feet per minute. Ear and sinus check is normally
     completed as a large group in the main chamber and is only accomplished when the
     initial chamber flight does not immediately precede this flight for all trainees and
     observers. Students and inside observers exit chamber following ear and sinus check.
     Divide students into appropriate groups in preparation for the rapid decompression
     flights.
     A2.3.3.3. Set the main chamber at the altitude determined to achieve a 4.5 psi rapid
     decompression for the field elevation while the inside observer seats the students in the
     lock compartment.
     A2.3.3.4. Direct the students to preflight their oxygen equipment and complete a
     communication check: student‘s name and seat number. If possible, the students should
     wear the same type of mask they will use during aircraft flight and should wear the masks
     as they do during routine flight. Masks will be worn in the down position, unconnected,
     before the rapid decompression. Connecting the mask will be demonstrated as part of
     rapid decompression recovery.
     A2.3.3.5. Ascend to 500 feet above field elevation or until a good door seal is achieved.
     Discuss indications of a rapid decompression and proper rapid decompression recovery
     procedures.
     A2.3.3.6. Inside observer signals the lock operator to fire the rapid decompression.
     A2.3.3.7. Lock observer monitors student recovery procedures and corrects if necessary,
     then directs lock operator to descend to ground level.
     A2.3.3.8. Inside observer reviews procedures for preventing/treating ear and sinus blocks
     and reviews effects of decompression.
     A2.3.3.9. At 10,000 feet, inside observer directs students to remove masks.
     A2.3.3.10. Review flight with trainees.
  A2.3.4. Post-flight Briefing. Review the chamber flight to emphasize learning outcomes.
  Give the trainees instructions to follow in case they experience any type of delayed reactions.

A2.4. Refresher Hypobaric Chamber Flight.
   A2.4.1. Refresher Hypobaric Chamber Flight Goals. Designed to reacquaint refresher
   trainees with the overall effects of barometric pressure change and permit them to practice
   the principles and techniques learned in the classroom in the low-pressure flight
   environment. Specific training objectives include trainee experience in:
      A2.4.1.1. The mechanical effects of pressure change (ear, sinus and gas expansion
      problems).
      A2.4.1.2. Positive pressure breathing resulting from the loss of cabin pressure in a low-
      pressure environment.
      A2.4.1.3. Applying the techniques and principles learned in the classroom to an
      accidental loss of cabin pressure.
      A2.4.1.4. Recognition of the loss of cabin pressurization, factors affecting the severity of
      the decompression, the physical and physiological responses present, and the proper
      response to these occurrences.
      A2.4.1.5. Hypoxia recognition and treatment using appropriate emergency procedures.
      A2.4.1.6. Proper oxygen equipment discipline in a low-pressure environment.
      A2.4.1.7. In-flight checks of oxygen equipment in a low-pressure environment.
      A2.4.1.8. Use of the emergency oxygen system and portable oxygen equipment.
      A2.4.1.9. Instilling proper habit patterns, to include proper wear of aircrew flight
      equipment. NOTE: Instructors will ensure that students wear their aircrew flight
      equipment and flight clothing properly (to the greatest extent possible).
      A2.4.1.10. Instilling and enhancing confidence in aircrew flight equipment. NOTE:
      Additional objectives may be added based on MAJCOM, mission, or aircraft type
      requirements, but training objectives may not be removed without an approved waiver.
AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                   39


  A2.4.2. Pre-flight Briefing. Instructor will explain the purpose and procedures of the flight
  as well as the need to perform an ear and sinus check before performing the main flight to all
  trainees. The instructor must also explain why, in pressurized aircraft, the oxygen is
  regulated with the setting on ―Normal‖ unless conditions of the flight dictate the use of 100
  percent oxygen. Use chamber time for training activities only. Use 100 percent oxygen up to
  8,000 feet where the masks are removed for the rapid ascent to FL250 and the hypoxia
  demonstration.
  A2.4.3. Simulated Flight in Low-Pressure Chamber Procedures. Inside personnel or
  trainees will not exceed altitudes at or above FL250 for more than 30 minutes or above
  FL180 for more than 1 hour.
     A2.4.3.1. During mask fitting, preflight check of oxygen equipment, and
     intercommunication check, trainees will don oxygen masks with regulator set at "100-
     percent oxygen."
     A2.4.3.2. Ascent and descent rates are as follows: ear and sinus check at 2,500 feet per
     minute; ascent to 8,000 feet at 5,000 feet per minute; 8,000 feet to FL250 at maximum
     vacuum; descent from FL250 to FL180 at 5,000 feet per minute; descent from FL180 feet
     to ground level at 2,500 feet per minute.
     A2.4.3.3. During ear and sinus check, ascend to 5,000 feet above ground level and
     return.
     A2.4.3.4. Ensure that 30 minutes of denitrogenation have been completed before
     reaching 8,000 feet in preparation for the hypoxia demonstration. During pre-breathing
     period, have trainees experience pressure breathing by using the narrow panel regulator
     in the EMERGENCY and the TEST MASK positions or the A-14 oxygen regulators
     when available.
     A2.4.3.5. During ascent to 8,000 feet and on to FL250, discuss decompression
     phenomena using training aids to demonstrate mechanisms. Demonstrate and practice
     using the oxygen regulators.
     A2.4.3.6. At 8,000 feet, the track T trainees desiring to use a quick don oxygen mask
     system will make the transition to this system if available.
     A2.4.3.7. After the oxygen systems have been switched and the communication with the
     trainees is rechecked, all trainees will drop their masks as the chamber is taken at
     maximum vacuum to FL250 feet. During ascent and subsequent time at FL250, trainees
     experience hypoxia within the limits of useful consciousness. Trainees resume breathing
     oxygen and are confirmed to be fully recovered before starting descent.
     A2.4.3.8. During descent to FL180, have trainees remove masks at FL220 and
     experience mild hypoxia.
     A2.4.3.9. At 18,000 feet, use visual aids to demonstrate effects of hypoxia on night
     visual acuity.
     A2.4.3.10. Descend to 10,000 feet while breathing normal oxygen. After descent below
     10,000 feet, oxygen masks may be disconnected and descent continued to ground level
     breathing air.

      A2.4.3.11. Practice using emergency and/or portable oxygen equipment as appropriate
      during the chamber flight. If pressure breathing was not demonstrated earlier, use
      portable oxygen equipment to practice breathing techniques using higher breathing
      pressures and review walk-around cylinder recharging. Discuss the need for ventilating
      middle ears after flights using oxygen. Discuss problems of rapid decompression.
      A2.4.3.12. Review flight and answer student questions.
   A2.4.4. Post-flight Briefing. Same as initial flight (see paragraph A2.1.6).

Figure A2.3. Refresher Hypobaric Chamber Flight.




A2.5. Altitude Chamber Reactions and Emergency Procedures.
   A2.5.1. Altitude Chamber Reactions.
      A2.5.1.1. Apprehension and Claustrophobia. Feelings of apprehension and
      claustrophobia may extend from a student‘s unfamiliarity with altitude chamber flights.
      Professionalism and sensitivity by AOP personnel can help alleviate problems and
      limit/minimize hyperventilation reactions. The best approach is to work with the student
      prior to the chamber flight, allowing them to practice breathing with an oxygen mask
      while sitting in the chamber with the doors open. The student should not be rushed or
      crowded. If a student insists on leaving the chamber during the flight, the student should
      be transferred to the lock, removed from the chamber, and referred to the flight surgeon.
      A2.5.1.2. Hyperventilation. Ensure reactor‘s regulator is gang-loaded and perform a
      PRICE check. IO monitors reactor‘s rate and depth of breathing. Once hypoxia has been
      ruled out, take their regulator out of the positive pressure setting. If the reactor cannot
      control rate and depth of breathing adequately, notify the APO and remove the reactor
      from the chamber. The APO will refer the student to the flight surgeon. If the reactor
AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                  41


     becomes unconscious or unresponsive for more than 30 seconds, follow procedures listed
     in para A2.5.3.1 of this instruction.
     A2.5.1.3. Suffocation. When a reactor reports feelings of suffocation, perform a PRICE
     check. If a PRICE check doesn‘t reveal the problem, replace the mask and/or change the
     regulator. Student may drop the mask as needed, but pre-breathe must be restarted if
     broken.
     A2.5.1.4. Hypoxia. Hypoxia (other than demonstration) may develop during the
     chamber flight for various reasons. Ensure reactor‘s regulator is gang-loaded and
     perform a PRICE check. IO monitors reactor‘s rate and depth of breathing. If the reactor
     becomes unconscious or unresponsive for more than 30 seconds, follow procedures in
     para A2.5.3.1 of this instruction.
     A2.5.1.5. Ear block. For pain on ascent, level off, descend and remove student. Crew
     Chief will notify the APO, who refers student to the flight surgeon. For pain on descent,
     level off. If the student is in pain, immediately bounce 2,000 feet and reassess.
     Ordinarily, an altitude bounce, valsalva, coughing against positive pressure (test mask
     setting on regulator) and/or nasal vasoconstrictive spray will be sufficient to equalize
     ears. The IO determines the need to alter flight profile (bounce again, slow descent rate)
     as needed to relieve symptoms and prevent reoccurrence with APO approval. The IO
     also may determine the need to use a Politzer bag, with APO approval.
     A2.5.1.6. Tooth pain. Tooth pain normally occurs on ascent. Tooth pain can be
     determined by singling out a specific tooth that hurts. If more than one tooth hurts or
     pain occurs on descent, suspect sinus problem and treat as such. Level chamber
     immediately and remove reactor from chamber and refer to flight surgeon for possible
     dental referral.
     A2.5.1.7. Abdominal pain. Mild gas discomfort during a chamber flight is normal.
     However, strong abdominal pain may occur if expanding gas pressure is not relieved at
     lower altitudes. When a reactor reports abdominal or GI pain, level off. Have the reactor
     change body position and massage the abdomen from upper right to lower left to assist in
     passing gas. If pain is extreme and can‘t be relieved, descend the chamber until the pain
     is relieved. The reactor should be escorted to the lock, brought to ground level, and
     referred to the flight surgeon. NOTE: In the event any of the above physiological
     symptoms can‘t be resolved, the APO will determine if the reactor should be removed
     from the chamber and referred to the flight surgeon.
  A2.5.2. Mechanical/Electrical Emergencies.
     A2.5.2.1. Power Outage. If electrical power is lost, the chamber and lock operators
     should ensure that vacuum and air valves are closed to maintain altitude. Further
     movement of the chamber should be directed by the APO. The crew chief will activate
     the battery powered lights and intercom system, and open all outside doors in the
     chamber room for additional light. The flight may be aborted or continued at the
     discretion of the APO.
     A2.5.2.2. Pump Failure. If vacuum is lost because of pump failure, chamber and lock
     operators will ensure that vacuum and air valves are closed to maintain altitude. The
     crew chief will attempt to analyze and correct the problem. The crew chief will restart
42                                                          AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012


     the malfunctioned pump or start another pump (if available) and valve it to the proper
     chamber. The flight may be aborted or continued at the discretion of the APO.
     A2.5.2.3. Fire.
         A2.5.2.3.1. Inside chamber (other than electrical fire). IOs will combat the fire
         with the fire extinguisher located in the chamber and lock compartments. The
         chamber operator will begin an immediate descent to ground level under guidance of
         the APO. The crew chief will initiate the alarm to the base fire station and then stand
         by the chamber door armed with an extinguisher, ready to assist inside personnel
         when ground level is reached. Students will transfer from the chamber oxygen supply
         to portable walk around assemblies and the crew chief will turn off the oxygen supply
         to the chamber. After students have been evacuated from the chamber, the crew chief
         will turn off all power to the chamber.
         A2.5.2.3.2. Electrical fire inside chamber. Water fire extinguishers should NOT be
         used to combat an electrical fire. The chamber operator should begin an immediate
         descent to ground level under the guidance of the APO. The crew chief should
         initiate the alarm to the base fire station and then stand by the chamber door ready to
         assist inside personnel when ground level is reached. Students will transfer from the
         chamber oxygen supply to portable walk around assemblies and the crew chief will
         turn off the oxygen supply to the chamber. After students have been evacuated from
         the chamber, the crew chief will turn off all power to the chamber.
         A2.5.2.3.3. Fire outside chamber. If a fire occurs in the chamber room or building,
         the chamber operator should start an immediate descent to ground level under the
         guidance of the APO. The crew chief should initiate the alarm to the base fire station.
         Other crew members will assist in evacuating students from the chamber.
     A2.5.2.4. Loss of Oxygen. If the oxygen supply to the chamber is lost, IOs should
     immediately transition to portable walk around oxygen assemblies and then assist
     students in connecting to their portable walk around oxygen assemblies. The APO
     should be notified immediately and the crew chief should activate the back-up oxygen
     manifold and assess the situation. If the oxygen supply can‘t be restored to the chamber
     within 2 minutes, the chamber operator will descend the chamber to 10,000 feet or below
     at a rate determined by the APO.
     A2.5.2.5. Physical disasters. These should be covered by unit-specific operating
     instructions.
  A2.5.3. Altitude Chamber Emergencies. Syncope (loss of consciousness or fainting),
  breathing cessation, loss of blood, extreme pain or decompression sickness constitute in-
  flight emergencies and must be treated seriously and with urgency. Report illnesses or
  injuries requiring medical care greater than first aid or lost duty days to local Safety office
  IAW appropriate 91 series AFIs.
     A2.5.3.1. Syncope.
         A2.5.3.1.1. Anytime a trainee becomes unconscious or unresponsive, the IO
         immediately gang-loads the trainee‘s regulator and ensures the trainee‘s mask is on.
AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                   43


        A2.5.3.1.2. If the trainee doesn‘t regain consciousness within 30 seconds after
        corrective action, the IO declares a medical emergency. The crew chief immediately
        calls 911 and communicates ―UNCONSCIOUS, UNRESPONSIVE INDIVIDUAL,‖
        and other necessary information, then contacts the APO. IOs place the reactor in a
        supine position on the floor and monitor respiration and pulse. Abort the training
        profile and initiate a rapid descent at 10-12,000 feet per minute. Implement basic
        resuscitation procedures as required. During descent, other AOP personnel (not on
        the flight) will make preparations to assist with transport/treatment of the reactor, as
        well as evacuation of other students.
        A2.5.3.1.3. If the student regains consciousness during the descent, the chamber
        should be leveled and the APO will determine whether to continue to descend the
        entire chamber or to remove the reactor via the lock and continue the flight for the
        remaining trainees. If time at altitude is not excessive, the APO may determine to re-
        ascend and complete hypoxia demonstration training for the remainder of the
        students.
        A2.5.3.1.4. The chamber lecturer continues to monitor other students and remind
        them to continually ventilate their ears and sinuses. IOs observe and assist other
        students for potential reactions.
        A2.5.3.1.5. Record blood pressure, pulse, respiration, signs, symptoms and time upon
        entry into the recovery room and every 15 minutes thereafter, until the flight surgeon
        authorizes discontinuation. Record vitals on the ―Reactor Data Record‖ form located
        in the recovery room.
        A2.5.3.1.6. If the patient is hospitalized, or oxygen therapy for DCS is administered,
        notify respective Squadron Commander as appropriate and AETC/A3FM within 1
        duty day of the incident, who will notify AFMSA/SG3PT and HQ USAF/A3O-AT
        per their requirements and complete appropriate Safety Investigation paperwork. The
        APO in charge of the flight is responsible for accuracy, completeness, and timely
        submission of the report.
     A2.5.3.2. Decompression sickness.
        A2.5.3.2.1. If this reaction occurs at altitude, place the reactor on 100% oxygen and
        ensure a good mask seal. Notify the APO and follow his/her directions.
        Monitor/record vital signs until the reactor is transported or a provider arrives and
        takes charge.
        A2.5.3.2.2. In the event of a delayed reaction, place the reactor on 100% oxygen with
        a tight fitting mask and notify the APO for instructions. Monitor/record vital signs
        until the reactor is transported or a provider arrives and takes charge.
        A2.5.3.2.3. APOs will direct the care and treatment of suspected acute and delayed
        DCS reactors until the flight surgeon arrives. Manage the reactor IAW local MDG
        DCS operating instructions.
        A2.5.3.2.4. Students will be instructed that, if they suspect DCS after duty hours,
        they should follow the specific local procedures provided to them by AOP personnel
        (contact emergency room or command post for flight surgeon on call).
44                                                    AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012


     A2.5.3.2.5. Notify Squadron Commander as soon as appropriate.                  Notify
     AETC/A3FM within 1 duty day of the incident, who will in turn notify
     AFMSA/SG3PT and HQ USAF/A3O-AI per their requirements. Complete local
     equipment inspection checklist and provide to safety office as required. The APO in
     charge of the flight is responsible for accuracy, completeness, and timely submission
     of the report.

 REDUCED OXYGEN BREATHING DEVICE (ROBD) OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

A3.1. General.
   A3.1.1. Overview. The ROBD training system provides hypoxia recognition and
   emergency procedures training for flight conditions that result in the need for supplemental
   or emergency oxygen. The ROBD shall be used IAW approved training plans detailing
   devices used to provide simulation of the member's flight tasks. The preferred task
   simulation devices are a flight simulator or HFT to train aircraft-specific hypoxia emergency
   procedures. MDS Lead Commands will develop training plans for ROBD after obtaining
   using commands‘ coordination and AETC/A3FM approval of part task trainers or flight task
   simulation. AETC/A3FM will maintain the master list of approved training plans and
   devices. The ROBD is an approved training system alternative to the low-pressure chamber
   for aircrew and parachutist refresher training requirements. Following guidance for other AP
   training devices, ROBD will not be used for research, unless purchased and sustained by the
   Air Force Research Laboratory or the 711 HPW for research purposes.
   A3.1.2. Description. The ROBD produces normobaric hypoxia by delivering a precise
   mixture of nitrogen and reduced oxygen from attached pressurized cylinders or from an
   oxygen/nitrogen extraction system. The reduced oxygen gas mixture is delivered to an
   aviator‘s oxygen mask to accurately simulate the equivalent oxygen concentration at altitudes
   from sea level to 34,000 feet. The instructor controls the altitude and concentration of
   oxygen in the gas mixture via the ROBD control interface by selecting the appropriate
   training profile. The training profile is an operator-programmed menu that consists of
   desired altitudes and simulated ascent rates. The instructor may start, change, or stop the
   training profile from the ROBD control interface. Following trainee-initiated hypoxia
   emergency procedures, the instructor initiates 100% oxygen with appropriate positive
   pressure from the control panel.
A3.2. Objectives and Demonstrations. IAW Chapter 3 and the appropriate syllabi, all training
requirements must be fulfilled for refresher students. At locations where the ROBD is available,
the refresher chamber flight should be replaced with this training system. ROBD training
operations will be accomplished IAW this Instruction and referenced ROBD and HFT checklists.
   A3.2.1. The following training objectives are required for ROBD hypoxia recognition and
   recovery training:
       A3.2.1.1. Experience the symptoms of hypoxia while in a simulated flight/mission
       environment.
       A3.2.1.2. Without assistance, perform the appropriate aircraft-specific hypoxia
       emergency procedures.
       A3.2.1.3. Demonstrate the correct positive pressure breathing technique during
       emergency oxygen activation when appropriate based on aircraft system characteristics.
       A3.2.1.4. Demonstrate proper pre-flight, in-flight, emergency and post-flight checks and
       configuration of oxygen equipment.

      A3.2.1.5. Recognize and correct night vision deficiencies resulting from decreased
      oxygen.
   A3.2.2. ROBD training profiles should be programmed for a 25,000 foot hypoxia
   demonstration and an 18,000 foot night vision demonstration. MAJCOM/A3 may deviate
   from these altitudes based on MDS-specific training requirements but must accomplish both
   demonstrations.
   A3.2.3. All ROBD training will use approved aircrew flight equipment. Oxygen panel will
   be configured per the aircraft technical order. If required, a list of part-task trainers and other
   flight task simulations will be approved by the MDS Lead Command A3 and AETC/A3FM.
   Upon approval, this list will be maintained by the MAJCOM‘s AP Training PM and
   AETC/A3FM.
A3.3. Personnel Requirements and Qualifications.
   A3.3.1. Minimum Personnel Requirements for ROBD: Only designated AOP personnel,
   AFSC 43A and 4M0X (7-level or above), may instruct and operate the ROBD for aircrew
   training. As a minimum, an AP Officer (APO) must be present for all ROBD training and
   may concurrently be an Instructor/Operator (I/O). If several ROBDs (two or more devices)
   are being used in the same location, each device will have a qualified and dedicated I/O.
   A3.3.2. Qualifications: All personnel will be graduates of the ROBD Operator Course,
   ROBD2OQT, and have documented upgrade training tasks on the correct AETC-
   standardized 797 prior to operating the ROBD or supervising ROBD operations.
   AETC/A3FM will manage and conduct the ROBD Operator Course and coordinate course
   training requests. All personnel operating and/or supervising ROBD operations must have
   current basic life support and automated external defibrillator (AED) certifications and must
   be current in AP training IAW this instruction.
A3.4. Responsibilities: This section covers the duties and responsibilities of the ROBD APO
and ROBD I/O.
   A3.4.1. APO. The APO is responsible for all phases of ROBD training, student safety and
   shall be present during ROBD operations. The APO will review the pre-flight student
   screening and refer any students with a suspected condition that might adversely affect the
   student during training to the flight surgeon. The APO will ensure that the flight surgeon has
   been notified of training start and finish. The APO is the go/no-go decision authority for
   remedial ROBD training following any unsuccessful completion of the training objectives
   outlined in paragraph A3.2. If unsuccessful completion of training objectives is due to an
   adverse reaction, APO will consult with flight surgeon prior to resuming training. APO will
   develop an ROBD emergency action plan to cover procedures in the event of mechanical
   failures and adverse/unusual student reactions. In the event of an emergency or
   adverse/unusual reaction during ROBD training, the APO will ensure all appropriate
   emergency procedures are executed and that the injury/adverse reaction is documented and
   reported IAW AFI 91-204.
   A3.4.2. I/O. The I/O is responsible for guiding and conducting student ROBD training. The
   I/O will contact the flight surgeon for notification of training session start and finish. The
   I/O ensures the correct ROBD configuration for training, operates the ROBD during the
   system self-test, selects and controls the training profiles, activates the ROBD emergency
AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                  47


   oxygen for student recovery and directly supervises the student‘s training session and
   completion of training objectives. The I/O as the first responder to any unusual student
   reactions will execute appropriate emergency procedures and will assist the APO with reactor
   management. The I/O will report the student injury/adverse reaction as a ground event IAW
   AFI 91-204.
A3.5. ROBD Training and Operating Procedures.
   A3.5.1. ROBD Flight Profiles. Aircraft flight simulator scenarios and HFT profiles used
   with the ROBD shall meet the training objectives outlined in paragraph A3.2 of this
   publication and shall be relevant to the wing flying mission and aircraft characteristics.
   Aircraft flight simulator and ROBD HFT scenarios and ROBD profiles must meet all training
   objectives in this instruction or appropriate syllabus. MDS Lead Command‘s AP Training
   Manager will establish basic mission profile, coordinate through using commands, and
   review owning OG/CC approved local scenarios. Upon approval, forward profile
   information to AETC/A3FM.
   A3.5.2. Hypoxia Recognition and Recovery Training. ROBD training profile altitude shall
   not exceed 25,000 feet for longer than 10 minutes nor shall blood oxygen saturation drop
   below 65% (whichever comes first).
   A3.5.3. Unaided Night Vision Hypoxia Demonstration. Night vision demonstration altitude
   shall not exceed 18,000 feet for longer than 10 minutes nor shall blood oxygen saturation
   below 65% (whichever comes first). Night vision demonstration will be accomplished as a
   separate training objective from A3.5.2 but should be provided during the same training
   event.
   A3.5.4. APO should consider the effect of repeated hypoxia exposure on training benefit and
   fatigue effects before allowing a third attempt at any hypoxia training objective during a
   training day.
   A3.5.5. The ROBD training session shall be terminated if the student loses consciousness or
   becomes incoherent and incapable of performing his emergency procedures. Subsequent
   flights may be performed, but only after the student has recovered fully (i.e., absence of
   symptoms and blood oxygen saturation greater than 95%) and flight surgeon has been
   consulted.
   A3.5.6. Any time a training session needs to be terminated while a low-oxygen gas mixture
   is being delivered to the student, use 100% Oxygen via the Oxygen Dump switch to
   terminate the training profile. For example, if the student‘s blood oxygen saturation drops
   below 65% or the student loses consciousness or becomes incapable of performing hypoxia
   recovery emergency procedures, then the training session should be terminated via activation
   of the Oxygen Dump switch by the I/O.
A3.6. ROBD Reactions and Emergencies.
   A3.6.1. Apprehension and Claustrophobia. Apprehension and claustrophobia should be
   minimal as training occurs in a familiar environment with experienced aircrew and
   parachutists. However, training is normally not accomplished while in a reduced oxygen
   environment, so apprehension and claustrophobia are still possible. Professionalism and
   sensitivity by AOP personnel can help alleviate problems and limit/minimize
48                                                          AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012


  hyperventilation reactions. If the student appears to be apprehensive, work with them prior
  to accomplishing ROBD training by practice breathing off of the device before the training
  event is to begin. The student should not be rushed or crowded. If the student insists on
  leaving the ROBD training site/simulator, the student should be allowed to leave and shall be
  referred to his/her commander or flight surgeon as required. If ROBD is determined not
  appropriate for training, then all efforts will be made to schedule the student at a chamber
  location where the training requirement can be achieved.
  A3.6.2. Hyperventilation. Hyperventilation can result from apprehension, positive pressure
  breathing and/or hypoxia. If student exhibits signs of hyperventilation, the I/O will activate
  the oxygen dump switch, monitor the student, and encourage the student to slow their
  breathing rate and depth. Having the student read a checklist or talk is one recommended
  way to slow breathing rate. If the student cannot control rate and depth of breathing
  adequately and/or blood oxygen saturation levels begin to drop after activation of 100%
  oxygen, the I/O will remove the student from the ROBD training system and will notify the
  APO. The APO will refer the student to the flight surgeon for further evaluation. If the
  student becomes unconscious or unresponsive for more than 30 seconds, place the student on
  the floor in a horizontal position (if practical) and follow procedures listed under loss of
  consciousness IAW paragraph A3.6.3.5.
  A3.6.3. Suffocation. When a student reports the feeling of suffocation, have the student
  immediately lower his/her mask and check connections. If connections-check is good, check
  ROBD system state for correct mode of operation and remedy if required IAW ROBD
  Operations Checklist. If the ROBD passes ops test then inspect reactor‘s mask and have
  him/her exchange aircrew flight equipment or provide student with a properly fitted training
  mask if available.
  A3.6.4. Hypoxia. If during the non-hypoxia stage of the training the student becomes
  hypoxic, immediately activate the oxygen dump switch on the ROBD. Monitor oxygen
  sensor and heart rate to ensure appropriate recovery. If hypoxia symptoms do not subside,
  instruct the student to disconnect the mask from the right side of his/her helmet and allow
  them to recover breathing ambient air; however, recovery from hypoxia may be delayed
  without 100% oxygen under pressure. Continue to monitor for recovery and ensure no
  further degradation of consciousness occurs.        If student becomes unresponsive or
  unconscious, follow procedures under loss of consciousness IAW paragraph A3.6.5.
  A3.6.5. Loss of Consciousness. Loss of consciousness is considered a medical emergency.
  If student loses consciousness for 30 seconds or more, activate the EMS system immediately
  then call the on-call flight surgeon. Ensure the student is on 100% oxygen (ROBD Oxygen
  Dump Switch activated) and place the student in a supine position on the floor and monitor
  respiration, pulse, and oxygen levels via the student‘s pulse oximeter until directed otherwise
  by emergency response personnel. Vital signs must be taken initially and at least every two
  minutes thereafter unless otherwise directed by emergency response personnel. Continue to
  provide basic emergency life saving skills and AED if available until relieved by emergency
  response personnel.
  A3.6.6. Mechanical/Electrical Emergencies.
     A3.6.6.1. Power Loss. If electrical power is lost during hypoxia portion of ROBD
     training, I/O will instruct the student to disconnect the mask from the right side of his/her
AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                         49


       helmet and allow them to recover breathing ambient air. If electrical power is lost during
       non-hypoxia portion of ROBD training, student will disconnect mask and wait for
       instructions from I/O. Training can be restarted once electrical power is restored and the
       IO has performed an ROBD self-test IAW ROBD operations checklist. Training will
       commence from the beginning of the profile following an equipment check/retest.
       A3.6.6.2. Electrical Fire. If an electrical fire is detected, cease all training activities and
       follow local emergency fire procedures. If not the source of the electrical fire, turn off
       the ROBD power switch and close all cylinder valves but do not disconnect any hoses.
       A3.6.6.3. Loss of Oxygen, Nitrogen, or Air. If oxygen source is inadequate during
       hypoxia recovery portion of ROBD training, the ROBD oxygen alarm will sound.
       Disconnect student from ROBD by instructing the student to disconnect the mask from
       the right side of his/her helmet and allow them to recover breathing ambient air; however,
       recovery from hypoxia will be delayed without 100% oxygen under pressure. If air and
       nitrogen sources are inadequate, the ROBD will disable hypoxia training and
       automatically activate 100% oxygen. Discontinue training until bottles are professionally
       serviced or replaced.
A3.7. Required Recurring Emergency Procedure Training. Emergency procedures must be
exercised no less than quarterly and can be scheduled concurrently with wing/MDG exercises or
inspections. These exercises should be conducted where ROBD training is located to include
simulator facilities at least annually. AT least two of these exercises must include local first
responder teams in an annual period. The senior AP staff member will ensure all training events
are documented and routed through appropriate agencies to ensure the opportunity for exercise
feedback from all responders.
A3.8. ROBD Training System Management. This section describes the roles and
responsibilities for ROBD training system management and sustainment.
   A3.8.1. AETC as Lead Command for the AP training program and AETC/A2/3/10 as the
   OPR will manage the ROBD training systems IAW AFPD 10-9 and AFI 36-2251 guidance.

  HYPOXIA FAMILIARIZATION TRAINER (HFT) OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

A4.1. General.
   A4.1.1. Overview. The HFT shall be used in conjunction with the ROBD to train aircraft-
   specific hypoxia emergency procedures. The HFT in conjunction with the ROBD is an
   approved aircrew training system alternative to the altitude chamber for refresher
   physiological training requirements. Two configurations are available, the HFT-C for
   cockpit crew, and the HFT-M for mission crew. For simplicity, this attachment refers to both
   using the term HFT. Each configuration‘s specifics for operation are detailed in the
   appropriate training plan.
   A4.1.2. Description. The HFT components are the main chassis and Instructor/Operator
   (I/O) Station. The Main Chassis emulates a generic aircraft cockpit with simulated flight
   controls and other panels a student uses to perform simulated flight duties, and mask-on
   hypoxia recognition and recovery procedures from induced hypoxic events. The I/O station
   is a commercial frame/enclosure that interfaces with the main chassis and contains the
   ROBD and other equipment/components for conducting and controlling training scenarios.
   The HFT is used to train aircrew to recognize and properly respond to the effects of hypoxia
   while performing simulated flight duties. The training replicates environmental conditions
   similar to those experienced by aircrew during high altitude missions, where an I/O has the
   ability to induce hypoxia without changes in barometric pressure.
   A4.1.3. Objectives and Demonstrations. At locations where the HFT is available, the
   altitude chamber refresher training flight may be replaced with this training system in
   conjunction with the ROBD. Hypoxia objectives and demonstrations are listed in A2.2 of
   this document.
   A4.1.4. Personnel Requirements and Qualifications. Personnel who have completed
   upgrade training per 43A or 4M0 CFETP and local upgrade requirements may operate the
   HFT as part of refresher physiological training. Because the HFT is operated in tandem with
   ROBD, personnel must also be qualified IAW para A3.3.
   A4.1.5. Responsibilities. This section covers the duties and responsibilities of the HFT
   APO and HFT I/O.
      A4.1.5.1. APO. The APO is responsible for all HFT procedures, and must ensure
      student safety at all times. The APO shall be present and follow guidance in A2.4. of this
      document during all HFT operations.
      A4.1.5.2. I/O. The I/O is responsible for guiding and conducting student HFT scenarios.
      The I/O directly supervises the student‘s training session and ensures completion of
      training objectives. The I/O will conduct the preflight briefing and post training review.
      The I/O will ensure compliance with all guidance in A2.4 of this instruction.
A4.2. Refresher training description. The HFT will be configured to replicate the trainee‘s
aircraft/crew position to the maximum extent IAW the most current HFT User Configuration
Guide provided by Detachment 1 ACC Training Support Squadron Luke AFB, AZ. All hypoxia
training conducted in the HFT will be accomplished IAW A2.2 of this document.
AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                  53


  A4.2.1. Goals. The HFT allows aircrew and parachutists to experience symptoms of
  hypoxia while performing duty related tasks and respond using proper emergency procedures
  in a controlled setting. Upon completion of training events, the student will have a
  heightened awareness of the potential compounding hazards that can result in the flight realm
  as a result of hypoxia.
  A4.2.2. Preflight Briefing Details. All students must complete the appropriate refresher
  academics prior to receiving training in an HFT. Additional briefing items will include
  training device limitations, actions that will be simulated and any safety items unique to
  individual training locations.
  A4.2.3. Training Description. AOPTUs will coordinate with the local OG to develop HFT
  scenarios to ensure aircraft specific training objectives are met. HFT profiles will mimic
  local flight operations to the maximum extent possible.
  A4.2.4. Post Training Review. Each student will receive a thorough post training briefing
  that is tailored to emphasize positive and negative aspects of how the individual
  accomplished hypoxia recovery procedures. Any flight task deviations that were caused by
  the hypoxia event will be explained in detail.
 54                                                             AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012

                     BARANY CHAIR OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

A5.1. General. The Barany chair is a rotational seating device used to generate a response to
motion within a trainee‘s vestibular system. Training applications for this device include spatial
disorientation familiarization training and airsickness physiological adaptation training. Training
goals, objectives and demonstrations for each use of the device are detailed within the respective
section below.
A5.2. Disorientation Familiarization Training. Spatial disorientation presents a serious threat
to aircrew safety. Disorientation Familiarization Training can be accomplished using several
trainers and demonstrations. The Barany chair is used during initial AP training to provide
trainees with an understanding of the visual and vestibular system‘s susceptibility to error.
   A5.2.1. Objectives        and      Demonstrations. Vestibulocular          reflexes     and
   somatogyral/oculogyral illusions can be demonstrated via the Barany chair by limiting
   additional orientation information from the visual, auditory, or somatosensory system.
   Instructors may direct various positioning causing an increased reaction in trainees, and
   providing a notable effect on the trainee‘s ability to interpret their orientation in two
   dimensional space. This disorientation is easily apparent to both the trainee and observers.
   The three primary demonstrations are listed in para A5.2.6.
   A5.2.2. Personnel Requirements and Qualifications. Personnel who have completed
   upgrade training per 43A or 4M0 CFETP and local upgrade requirements may demonstrate
   spatial disorientation to trainees as a part of initial physiology training. Initial trainees should
   observe all three demonstrations and experience one.
   A5.2.3. Preflight Briefing.       Trainees will receive academic instruction on spatial
   disorientation prior to training. Each trainee will be briefed on safety prior to Barany chair
   demonstration. This requirement may be met with a general brief to the class when the
   training session begins. Specific instructions for executing each maneuver will be briefed to
   trainees as each maneuver begins; there is no requirement for this information to be reviewed
   in a pre-brief.
   A5.2.4. Spatial Disorientation Familiarization Training Description
       A5.2.4.1. Graveyard Spin/Spiral. Ensure trainee is sitting upright, arms resting on the
       arm rests with thumbs straight up to the ceiling. Fasten outer arm of the chair and seat
       belt, if applicable. Brief the trainee to point in the direction of the turn perceived before
       the trainee dons goggles and hearing protection. Brief any observers to stay quiet. Begin
       rotating the chair clockwise to simulate spinning to the right. Continue spinning until
       achieving a constant rate of rotation. Minimize abrupt inputs to the chair so the student
       cannot perceive the added acceleration. Continue at a constant rate for approximately 30
       seconds. If the trainee still perceives the clockwise rotation, stop making inputs into the
       chair. When the trainee shows no perceived rotation (via thumbs up hand signal), show
       observers the trainee‘s non-perception, and slow or stop the chair‘s rotation. Ideally, the
       student will sense rotation in the opposite direction when the rotation stops. Allow the
       student to recover for a short period of time before sending them back to their seat.
       When they feel no rotation, they may return to their seats. Briefly explain the physiology
AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                        55


       of semicircular canals and cause of disorientation in this example after the demonstration.
       If desired affect not achieved; wait a minute and try again opposite direction, or simply
       explain what should happen.
       A5.2.4.2. Nystagmus. Ensure trainee is sitting upright, arms resting on the arm rests.
       Fasten outer arm of the chair and seat belt, if applicable. Direct the trainee to pick a focal
       point and rotate his head/eyes to maintain the focal point within his line of sight. Begin
       rotating the chair and continue spinning until achieving a constant rate of rotation. The
       trainee should focus on the approximate location of the focal point as continued spinning
       reduces visual acuity. Continue spinning for approximately 20-30 seconds. Stop the
       rotation so the spinning student is facing the focal point. Instruct the student to open their
       eyes as wide as possible, focus on the focal point, and ask the student to explain how
       difficult it is to focus. Point out the involuntary eye movement to the class. Allow the
       student to recover for a short period of time before sending them back to their seat.
       When they feel no rotation, they may return to their seat. Briefly explain what is
       happening physiologically with muscles in the eyes.
       A5.2.4.3. Coriolis. Have trainee sit with weight back in the chair, arms crossed over the
       outer bar with pillow underneath, head resting on their crossed arms as if sleeping on a
       desk, with one ear pointing towards the ground. Table A5.1. describes demonstration
       orientation and resulting feeling of disorientation in the trainee. Direct the trainee to
       close his eyes and to quickly sit upright with arms in the air when the spinning stops.
       Rotate the chair in a clockwise direction for approximately 30 seconds. Ensure the
       student does not get ―top heavy‖ with their weight distributed towards the outside of the
       spinning. If chair starts to rock, have the student sit back in the chair, or terminate the
       demonstration. Stop the chair with the trainee facing the class and have him describe
       what motion he perceives.

Table A5.1. Coriolis Demonstration Orientation and Trainee Effects.
               Demo Orientation                                Effect
   Head Right, Spun Right (clockwise)             Front Right Tumble
   Head Right, Spun Left (counterclockwise)       Front Left Tumble
   Head Left, Spun Right (clockwise)              Back Left Tumble
   Head Left, Spun Left (counterclockwise)        Back Right Tumble
          A5.2.4.3.1. Allow the student to recover for a short period of time before sending
          them back to their seat. When they feel no rotation, they may return to their seats.
          Briefly explain what is happening physiologically with more than one semicircular
          canal stimulated at one time.
   A5.2.5. Post Flight Brief/Post Training Review. Ensure trainees understand the
   physiological cause for the illusion demonstrated and illusion‘s relevance to aviation
   operations.
A5.3. Aircrew Rotational Training (ART). Airsickness desensitization or adaptation training
using a Barany chair occurs via ART. ART is a consecutive three day program with each day
lasting one to two hours. ART saves valuable training dollars and time by educating and
building confidence in airsickness control techniques in trainees. For maximum efficacy, the
program should occur during three days of flying followed by spinning in the Barany chair.
 56                                                           AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012


Each day of the program focuses on a different aspect of controlling airsickness. WARNING:
All flying for the trainee must be completed prior to that day’s Barany spins. Trainees are not
allowed to fly after spinning in the chair until they have had at least 12 hours un-interrupted
crew rest.
   A5.3.1. Objectives and Demonstrations. Day one teaches the student to determine
   different factors influencing their susceptibility to airsickness. It also gives them the chance
   to practice mechanical methods of reducing airsickness. Day two teaches techniques used to
   relax the body and lower student‘s airsickness arousal level. Day three builds confidence in
   the student‘s ability to control their susceptibility to airsickness. Maneuvers that can be used
   in spin sessions include a climb simulated by having the trainee focus eyes on focal point on
   the ceiling and hold for three revolutions or a bank simulated by holding their right or left
   ear, respectively to the shoulder.
   A5.3.2. Personnel Requirements and Qualifications. Students and aircrew with
   airsickness problems may be referred to the local AOPTU for ART as a part of an overall
   Airsickness Management protocol administered under flight surgeon guidance. Flight
   surgeons may refer airsick students to psychologists, where available, for relaxation
   techniques training or additional training/resources. Physiology personnel may accomplish
   introductory counseling, teach relaxation techniques if needed, and perform desensitization
   training using the Barany chair but are not responsible for overall case management.
   Physiology personnel will document training via database or MFR and provide copies to
   trainee‘s squadron commander if required. Deviations in spin protocols as described in para
   A5.3.6.1-A5.3.6.4 may be directed by flight surgeon as needed for individual patients.
   A5.3.3. Responsibilities
       A5.3.3.1. Trainee Responsibilities: Practice the relaxation/diaphragmatic breathing
       techniques while both flying and chair flying. Attend all scheduled training sessions at
       AOPTF each of the three days. If there is a break in flying while still in the three day
       program (due to weather, scheduling, etc.) the trainee will still complete that day of ART.
       Students who begin a 3 day ART program will complete all three days, even if there are
       no airsickness episodes during Day 2 or Day 3 flying.
       A5.3.3.2. Instructor Responsibilities: Counsel trainees on relaxation techniques using
       both preventive education and the Barany chair. Instructors may be required to be
       available for training whenever the student‘s flying schedule dictates per local policy.
   A5.3.4. Goals. The program is designed to speed adaptation to the flight environment via a
   joint approach between the flying squadrons, Flight Medicine, AOP personnel, and Mental
   Health. This guidance simply governs AOP support to a comprehensive Airsickness
   Management protocol. The entire airsickness management program and associated protocols
   should be determined by appropriate SG leadership.
   A5.3.5. Preflight Briefing. Instruction will be tailored to the individual based on the
   student‘s initial interview. Discuss their emotional, mental and physical state of being
   throughout the entire day of flying. Focus on high stress activities such as emergency
   procedures, mission planning, crew briefing, and if applicable, stand up, SP/IP relationships
   and progress in flying training.
AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                          57


      A5.3.6. ART Description. Trainees receive three days of consecutive spins using the
      Barany chair and may receive refresher spins if needed. Table A5.2. illustrates the subjective
      airsickness rating chart, which is used to measure the trainee‘s response to duration and
      stimulus. Trainee ratings should be recorded and may be used as a measure of progression in
      their training.

Table A5.2. Subjective Airsickness Rating Chart.
  Airsick Rating                                            Indication
1-3                     Indicates low level of nausea or discomfort. Would not affect duties during
                        flight.
4-6                     Indicates a medium nausea level. Would cause the student to deviate from
                        planned flight, i.e. straight and level flight
7-9                     Indicates a high nausea level. Would cause the a trainee to modify or stop
                        performing flight duties, i.e. transfer flight control to the IP
10                      student becomes actively sick
         A5.3.6.1. Day One Spin Training. Trainee receives two ten minute spins with a ten
         minute break between each spin session. The primary objective for day one is to get to
         know the trainee, the history of their problem, and observe the trainee‘s reaction to
         extensive rotation. This is initial phase enables the student and instructor to identify
         personal behavioral patterns and physiological/psychological symptoms in relation to
         airsickness. During this spin, the intent is to assess the trainee‘s susceptibility to motion.
         Let the trainee know his/her signs of airsickness, such as paleness, sweating, sudden
         flushing of the face after performing a head-movement, etc. so they have a more intimate
         knowledge of what is happening to their body prior to becoming actively airsick.
             A5.3.6.1.1. Spin rate is 20-25 RPMs.
             A5.3.6.1.2. Trainee spins with eyes open and fixated on the focal point.
             A5.3.6.1.3. Make a note of any outward (objective) symptoms observed. Examples
             include gripping the arm rests hard, sweating, paleness, hyperventilating, etc.
             A5.3.6.1.4. Periodically (e.g. each minute) ask the student his or her level of
             airsickness and record these readings.
             A5.3.6.1.5. The student might perform a few maneuvers or head movements during
             this ride, if needed to raise nausea levels. They can practice any techniques they
             currently use for motion sickness. Do not go into ―drop-off‖ maneuvers at this time.
             A5.3.6.1.6. After the spin is finished, discuss subjective and any outward (objective)
             symptoms with the student. Give the student a 10-minute break before the second
             spin.
             A5.3.6.1.7. If student becomes actively sick, stop the spin.
         A5.3.6.2. Day Two Spin Training. Trainee receives three ten minute spins with a ten
         minute break between each spin session. The primary objective of day two is to reinforce
         the student‘s understanding of their symptoms that precede airsickness. Practice deep
         diaphragmatic breathing, rhythmic breathing, ―drop-off‖ (a continuing cycle of tensing
         muscles, then relaxing them) maneuver techniques, and progressive muscle relaxation.
58                                                          AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012


     Simulate realistic aircraft scenarios in the Barany chair and require the student to control
     their nausea level. The goal for each spin would be to have the student‘s nausea peak at
     least once per spin in the 7-8 range on the nausea scale. Nausea at the higher end of at
     least once per spin forces the student to control it. When they accomplish this
     effectively, they gain confidence in their abilities and they can incorporate the technique
     in flight.
        A5.3.6.2.1. Spin rate is 20-25 RPMs.
        A5.3.6.2.2. Trainee spins with eyes open and fixated on the focal point.
        A5.3.6.2.3. Make a note of any outward (objective) symptoms observed. Examples
        include gripping the arm rests hard, sweating, paleness, hyperventilating, etc.
        A5.3.6.2.4. Periodically ask the student his or her level of airsickness and record
        these readings.
        A5.3.6.2.5. Talk the student through the progressive muscle relaxation as needed to
        lower subjective airsickness rating.
        A5.3.6.2.6. If student becomes actively sick, stop the spin.
        A5.3.6.2.7. Encourage the student to practice diaphragmatic breathing and muscle
        relaxation techniques on their own time to enhance success.
     A5.3.6.3. Day Three Spin Training. Trainee receives three ten minute spins with a ten
     minute break between each spin session. The primary objective of day three is to build
     that final amount of confidence and adaption in the student. Review progress and
     relaxation techniques with students.
        A5.3.6.3.1. Spin rate is 20-25 RPMs.
        A5.3.6.3.2. Trainee spins with eyes open and fixated on the focal point.
        A5.3.6.3.3. Make a note of any outward (objective) symptoms observed. Examples
        include gripping the arm rests hard, sweating, paleness, hyperventilating, etc.
        A5.3.6.3.4. Periodically ask the student his or her level of airsickness and record
        these readings.
        A5.3.6.3.5. When final spin is complete, get feedback from student on their
        confidence level and discuss follow-up actions and ability to self-refer for refresher
        spin training as needed.
     A5.3.6.4. Refresher Spin Training. Trainee receives one ten minute spin and one two
     minute spin with a ten minute break between each spin session as needed after
     completion of the three day program. These spins are warranted if the student
     experiences an airsickness episode after completing the three day program. Physiology
     personnel must ensure that flight surgeon/flying squadron commanders receive training
     documentation for each refresher spins for self-referred trainees.
  A5.3.7. Post Training Follow-up Actions. Instructors will follow up with students after
  their first sortie upon ART and again one month post ART completion. Discuss any
  recurrent airsickness symptoms and what measures were used to compensate. Follow-up is
AFI11-403 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                   59


  not required to occur via in-person interview; a telephone interview is an acceptable means of
  completing this requirement. Follow-up after refresher spin training is not required.
