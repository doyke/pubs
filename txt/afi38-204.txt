                                                Chapter 1

                   PROGRAMMING AND ALLOCATING USAF MANPOWER

1.1. Manpower Resources. All budgeted and programmed manpower resources for the total Air Force
(Active, and Air Reserve Component) derive from two sources:
    The Department of Defense (DoD) Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).
    The Air Force Force and Financial Plan (F&FP).
    1.1.1. The DoD uses program elements in the FYDP to budget for and control its resources. A Pro-
    gram Element Code (PEC) accounts for each DoD program in the FYDP.
    1.1.2. The Air Force uses the F&FP to budget for and control its portion of the subsets of DoD PECs.
    Resources in the F&FP aggregated to DoD PEC level represent the Air Force portion of the FYDP.

1.2. Chain of Responsibilities:
    1.2.1. From these sources, the Directorate of Manpower, Organization and Quality, Program Devel-
    opment Division (HQ USAF/XPMP) allocates programmed manpower resources to the commands
    directing implementation of approved programs.
    1.2.2. The commands translate these manpower resources into manpower authorizations by updating
    the Unit Manpower Document by organization, AFSC, grade, program element code, etc.
    1.2.3. Manpower and Quality Offices provide this detailed identification to the Personnel community
    to begin the actions necessary to recruit, train, and assign people. Simultaneously, the Air Force Per-
    sonnel Center receives an electronic copy of all active military and civilian authorization changes
    from the Manpower Data System (MDS).

1.3. Manpower Resource Levels. HQ USAF allocates the manpower in the Air Force FYDP to the
commands to support approved Air Force programs. HQ USAF adjusts command manpower in the Air
Force FYDP via programmatic decisions made through the Air Force Corporate process, SECDEF/CSAF
decisions, Program Decision Memorandums (PDM) or Program Budget Decisions (PBD).
    1.3.1. Changing Manpower Allocations. Command specific military and civilian manpower require-
    ments must be certified by the command XPM, approved by HQ USAF/XPM and accepted by the Air
    Force Corporate Structure before they can be used in the programming/resourcing process. It is essen-
    tial to pursue competitive sourcing as a means to source new requirements that are not military essen-
    tial or inherently governmental. Notify HQ USAF/XPMP of command initiatives that would drive a
    change to active duty manpower allocations. Notify HQ USAF/REX , with information copy to HQ
    USAF/XPMP, of initiatives that require changes to Reserve manpower allocations. Notify NGB/
    XPPI, with information copy to HQ USAF/XPMP, of initiatives that require changes to Air National
    Guard manpower allocation. HQ USAF approves these changes via the Air Force Corporate process.
        1.3.1.1. Give reasons for the requested manpower change, including both mission and support
        manpower.
        1.3.1.2. If command initiatives require an increase in military manpower, propose specific mili-
        tary tradeoffs or other accommodations. If command initiatives are approved through the corpo-
AFI38-204 1 AUGUST 1999                                                                                  5


       rate process, HQ USAF either reprograms military resources within the command or acquires
       resources from some other source.
       1.3.1.3. If command initiatives require an increase in civilian manpower, identify specific civilian
       tradeoffs or other accommodations. If command initiatives are approved through the corporate
       process, HQ USAF either reprograms civilian resources or funds from within the command, or
       acquires resources from some other source.
   1.3.2. Accommodating Temporary Manpower Requirements. D o n o t c h a n g e m a n p o w e r
   resources in the Air Force FYDP to accommodate cyclical or temporary requirements. Instead:
       Authorize overtime, temporary full-time, part-time, or occasional hire of civilian personnel.
      Authorize temporary duty of military and civilian personnel.
      Use contract services.
       1.3.2.1. Use available funds and command civilian employment plans to employ civilians.
       1.3.2.2. Process manpower or workload requirements expected to last more than two years
       through the appropriate panel in the corporate process so HQ USAF/XPM can adjust the Air Force
       FYDP.
   1.3.3. Transferring Manpower Resources. Process interservice support agreements involving the
   transfer of manpower resources as specified in DoD Regulation 4000.19, Interservice and Intragov-
   ernmental Support, August 9, 1995.
       1.3.3.1. Process Commercial Activities (CA) programming actions through the command man-
       power resource manager after coordinating the action with the command CA program manager.
       1.3.3.2. Process Reserve manpower programming actions through HQ USAF/REX, with infor-
       mation copy to HQ USAF/XPMP. Process Air National Guard manpower programming actions
       through NGB/XPPI, with information copy to HQ USAF/XPMP.

1.4. Manpower Resource Accountability. Air Force PECs provide HQ USAF resource accountability.
Each Air Force program element contains three manpower categories: officer, enlisted, and civilian. The
civilian category contains three subcategories: US direct hire (USDH), foreign national direct hire
(FNDH), and foreign national indirect hire (FNIH). Reserve end strength is further identified in the
FYDP by Resource Identifier Code (RIC) as drill officer and enlisted, Individual Mobilization Augmen-
tee (IMA) officer and enlisted, and Air Guard Reservists (AGR).
   1.4.1. End Strengths. HQ USAF allocates manpower resources to the commands at the end of each
   FYDP update, making out-of-cycle allocations as necessary. Commands must balance end strengths
   in the Manpower Data System (MDS) by identities of Active, Guard, Reserve, and IMAs with the
   allocated end strengths. These strengths by DOD program element code (PEC) must remain within
   the overall levels allocated by HQ USAF with temporary deviations of up to .5 percent being consid-
   ered compliant.
   1.4.2. Deviations within Program Elements. Commands may change Air Force program elements
   within an allocation provided they are within the same DoD program element. Restrict changes to
   essential circumstances and submit reprogramming actions promptly to HQ USAF/XPMP to initiate a
   zero balance programming request through the corporate process. Reprogramming actions for
   Reserve manpower should be submitted to HQ USAF/REX, with information copy to HQ USAF/
6                                                                          AFI38-204 1 AUGUST 1999


    XPMP. Reprogramming actions for Air National Guard manpower should be submitted to ANG/
    XPPI, with information copy to HQ USAF/XPMP.
       1.4.2.1. Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) end strength, including IMA Allocation Team
       (IMAAT) results, are reprogrammed through HQ USAF/XPMP by HQ USAF/REX. Any preced-
       ing announcement memorandum from HQ ARPC/XP are for command information only and no
       action is to be taken until reprogramming allocations occur.
    1.4.3. Pipeline Accounts. HQ USAF centrally manages military manpower authorizations in tran-
    sient, holding (prisoners, patients and separatees), and students in the TDY training, enroute, and PCS
    pipeline accounts.
    1.4.4. Management Headquarters. Command manpower resources for management headquarters
    organizations must use the specific management headquarters program element ending in 98. Do not
    exceed HQ USAF constraints on management headquarters. Refer to AFI 38-202 (formerly AFR
    26-8) for further guidance in programming manpower in AF management headquarters and headquar-
    ters support activities.
    1.4.5. Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) End Strength. Additions and deletions to the MDS are
    done through a memorandum to the commands from HQ USAF/REX or ANG/XPPI. This also
    applies to Base IMA Administrators (BIMAA).
    1.4.6. Air Reserve Technicians. Air Reserve Technicians (ART) are identified by a memo entry in
    the FYDP and an ART ID code on the MDS.

1.5. Manpower Allocation Procedures:
    1.5.1. HQ USAF Actions:
       1.5.1.1. Allocate manpower resources to the commands in the Manpower Allocation Transaction
       Report.
       1.5.1.2. Compare the resources allocated to the authorizations reported, by the commands, by Air
       Force PEC, to ensure resource accountability.
       1.5.1.3. Allocate manpower resources by command, country code, PEC, and category for the cur-
       rent and the six succeeding fiscal years.
    1.5.2. Command Actions:
       1.5.2.1. Record authorizations in the Manpower Transaction Report:
          Within 30 days for actions effective during the current fiscal year.
          Within 60 days for actions effective the next fiscal year.
          Within 90 days for actions effective in the current fiscal year plus two.
       1.5.2.2. Implement manpower adjustments beyond the current year plus two as soon as possible.
       1.5.2.3. In the Unit Manpower Document, show that HQ USAF allocated resources for a given
       fiscal year are valid authorizations for each quarter, as established in the USAF Program, Installa-
       tions, Units and Priorities (PD) document. For example, allocated resources effective for FY 99
       would be valid for fiscal quarters 99/2, 99/3, and 99/4 when the PD shows a program effective
       date of 99/2.
AFI38-204 1 AUGUST 1999                                                                                7


       1.5.2.4. Manpower will be eliminated from the MDS, effective the fiscal quarter of the associated
       mission change. However, when a mission is extended from one to three quarters, the MAJCOM/
       XPM will, where appropriate, submit a request to HQ USAF/XPMP to over allocate manpower on
       the MAJCOM MDS to match the mission change. For requirements that extend four or more fis-
       cal quarters, the MAJCOM will submit the requirement through the Air Force corporate process as
       a disconnect.
       1.5.2.5. Ensure authorizations in the MDS match total allocated FYDP by DoD PEC. Deviations
       of more than .5 percent for a PEC are non-compliant.

1.6. Host Tenant Manpower Actions. Commands whose initiatives impose extra work on other com-
mands must coordinate with the affected command.
   1.6.1. Tasking Command Actions:
       1.6.1.1. Give the tasked command the information it needs to determine its manpower require-
       ments.
       1.6.1.2. Negotiate with the tasked command regarding availability of existing resources to sup-
       port the requirement.
       1.6.1.3. Program required manpower actions in the first available exercise in the Planning Pro-
       gramming, Budgeting System (PPBS) cycle.
   1.6.2. Tasked Command Actions. Assess your own manpower resources and inform the tasking
   command of any additional resources you need to perform the proposed workload or mission.
   1.6.3. Who Programs and Budgets for Manpower. The command designated as the lead agency
   for a particular Air Force program or system must initiate programming and budgeting for required
   manpower resources.
   1.6.4. Who Pays for Additional Manpower Costs. The party desiring or causing an action must
   initiate action to fund the additional costs. A coordinated memorandum of agreement or host-tenant
   support agreement is required prior to transfer of manpower resources. This is especially important if
   the manpower resource must transfer between active and air reserve components or between services.

1.7. Base Support. Programmed changes in mission manpower effect changes in base support manpower.
These changes are quantified through AF base support factors (see Table 1.1.), which are used by HQ
USAF, major commands, field operating agencies (FOA), and direct reporting units (DRU).
   1.7.1. Base Support Factors. The base support factor estimates the incremental impact in base sup-
   port manpower generated by a change in mission manpower requirements. Its use assumes the pres-
   ence of a full base support infrastructure prior to making the proposed mission manpower changes.
   1.7.2. How To Use the Base Support Factors. BOS requirements vary dramatically dependant on
   the extent of competitive sourcing at a base. The different factors recognize differences in the
   required level of support. Use Table 1.1. to determine the proper BOS factor. All future BOS tail
   actions need to be reviewed in this light (i.e., you can not take BOS tail at “Pick-a-Base” locations
   where BOS has already been taken).

NOTES:
Multiply the number of mission manpower resources associated with the unit mission change by the fac-
tor for the type of support involved (i.e., general support).
The General Support Factor is only applied against permanent party manpower. Student factor is only
applied against PCS/pipeline students. Do not add factors together before applying.
       1.7.2.1. This instruction provides these overall factors and manpower category percentages
       (officer, enlisted, civilian) for general programming guidance. Commands may adjust base sup-
       port computations based on the specific situation and location. However, Air Staff manpower pro-
       gramming will be done using these factors and MAJCOM deviations must be justified to HQ
       USAF/XPMP. Further, the MAJCOM submitting the deviation must offset any additional man-
       power costs.
       1.7.2.2. When a change in mission manpower is predominantly civilian, the supporting command
       may request HQ USAF/XPMP decrease the base support factor by as much as 50 percent.
       1.7.2.3. For mission transfers between Active, Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve, or, new
       Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve missions added to an active duty base requiring BOS be
       given to the host command, HQ USAF computes base support impacts as follows:
          1.7.2.3.1. For Air Reserve Technicians and Air National Guard Military Technicians, HQ
          USAF computes BOS using 50 percent of the approved CONUS general support factor.
          1.7.2.3.2. For Active Guard and Reserves (AGRs), HQ USAF computes BOS impacts using
          the same approved CONUS general support factor used for active full time military.
          1.7.2.3.3. For drill spaces, HQ USAF computes base support by applying a 2-percent factor to
          total drill spaces.
AFI38-204 1 AUGUST 1999                                                                                  9


           1.7.2.3.4. Competitive sourcing and privatization contract dollars required to be transferred as
           the result of mission transfer between commands must be negotiated between the gaining and
           losing commands. Agreed-to-dollar transfer must be incorporated into the Program Change
           Request or commands’ Financial Plans for budget year transfer.
           1.7.2.3.5. Any resulting support manpower reductions associated with these mission transfers
           will be retained by HQ USAF/XPMP as program savings. Any resulting increases in support
           manpower associated with these mission transfers must be programmed as part of the mission
           transfer and offset by the activity proposing the transfer.
       1.7.2.4. MAJCOMs must coordinate all self-initiated programming factors with the affected com-
       mands (including host tenant support agreements and intercommand transfers) that impose BOS
       workload on other commands. HQ USAF does not provide base support resources in such cases.
       1.7.2.5. For actions impacting the Air Reserve Components, the tasking command, including the
       Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve for programming changes impacting the reserve compo-
       nents, must develop manpower agreements and work with the affected commands on transfers of
       base support resources to support unit moves. The tasking command provides, or programs for,
       required base support resources when a prime function or tenant organization of that command is
       moved. Refer any disagreement between losing and gaining commands to HQ USAF/XPMP.
       1.7.2.6. HQ USAF/SG determines medical base support requirements.
       1.7.2.7. The Defense Commissary Agency determines commissary base support requirements.
       1.7.2.8. HQ USAF normally does not program a base support manpower tail to support changes
       to other base support functions.
       1.7.2.9. USAF organizations tasked by other government departments or DoD agencies must
       develop manpower and funding agreements via the inter-service support agreement (ISSA) and
       work with HQ USAF/XP and respective functional staff to ensure that required out-year man-
       power programming actions are addressed.

1.8. Manpower Time phasing. Command XPM activities make program changes to manpower require-
ments in Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) detail. Affected commands must promptly include these
changes in their Manpower Transaction Reports. Per paragraph 1.5.2.1. this will allow personnel activi-
ties to implement required actions.
   1.8.1. Out-of-Cycle Command Actions. Hold out-of-cycle command actions to a minimum. As
   with authorizations, the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) does not maintain a reserve of
   active-duty personnel to respond to short-notice manpower actions. Therefore, to prevent such
   actions from hindering the assignment process, command XPM and Personnel activities jointly decide
   when to pursue out-of-cycle action.
   1.8.2. Military Manpower Increases. Do not increase military manpower authorizations made
   effective in the current or two succeeding fiscal quarters unless command Personnel activities confirm
   that such a short lead time would not negatively impact the personnel assignments process.
   1.8.3. Manpower Reductions. Implement military and civilian authorization reductions when HQ
   USAF or the tasking command eliminates the manpower requirement. Reductions that are not related
   to the loss of a specific workload or mission take effect when a higher authority levies the reduction
   per the allocation process, paragraph 1.5.
10                                                                          AFI38-204 1 AUGUST 1999


     1.8.4. Intercommand Transfer of Functions and Related Authorizations. Use the programmed
     lead times identified in the previous paragraphs. Since intercommand transfers often involve man-
     power realignment among Major Force Programs (MPFs), the constraints associated with crossing
     budget appropriations and MFPs may limit timing of civilian realignments among DoD program ele-
     ments. Therefore, losing and gaining commands must work closely together.
        1.8.4.1. Manpower resources can only be transferred for a given fiscal year. Use the losing com-
        mand's manpower authorizations during the 4th quarter of the fiscal year in which the transfer
        occurs as the baseline for an intercommand transfer. Using this baseline ensures that command's
        files and the FYDP agree.
        1.8.4.2. Once intercommand negotiations begin on transferring functions, the losing command no
        longer adjusts manpower authorizations in the functions proposed for transfer. Also, the losing
        command must provide, on request, an associated manpower display for the two-year period
        before the proposed transfer date.
        1.8.4.3. To prevent duplicate end-strength reporting, complete manpower authorization transfers
        between commands within the Manpower Data System during the same month, and with the same
        effective date.

1.9. Authorizations for Nonpermanent Party and Other Services. Commands must report HAF
MDS NPP data in non-Air Force tenant units, rotational units, and other nonpermanent party strength to
ensure accurate programmed population data for installations.
     1.9.1. Permanent Change of Station Student Resources. Commands report permanent change of
     station student resources, allocated as Air Force Academy cadets or officer or enlisted students, in the
     MDS outgoing interface to HAF MDS.
     1.9.2. Rotational Units. Only the deploying command reports Air Force rotational units in the MDS
     outgoing interface to HAF MDS. The deploying command identifies, by base and country, those
     CONUS units deployed to foreign countries in a rotational status. Do not report Pacific Air Forces
     and United States Air Forces in Europe intratheater rotational units.

                 RESERVE FORCES UNIT MANPOWER AUTHORIZATIONS

2.1. Authorizing Manpower Requirements. The Secretary of the Air Force constitutes and authorizes
Air Reserve Component (ARC) units to the National Guard Bureau (NGB) and Headquarters Air Force
Reserve Command (HQ AFRC) for activation. These units form the first and primary source of Active
Force augmentation.

2.2. Managing Manpower Requirements. Manpower managers at all levels must provide adequate
emphasis for ARC manpower management.

2.3. Responsibilities.
   2.3.1. HQ USAF/XPM:
       2.3.1.1. Issue Department of the Air Force (DAF/XPM) letters under Secretary of the Air Force
       (SAF) authority to control numbers and names for Air National Guard (ANG) and US Air Force
       Reserve Command (AFRC) units.
       2.3.1.2. Constitute and allot new ANG units to the NGB which, in turn, allocates units to the indi-
       vidual states.
       2.3.1.3. Arbitrate manpower requirement disagreements between gaining commands and the
       ARC.
       2.3.1.4. Monitor the HQ USAF manpower data systems (HAF MDS) consolidated manpower
       database (CMDB) to make sure the data complies with policies and procedures.
       2.3.1.5. Validate authorizations needed for the nonmobilized environment.
       2.3.1.6. Review ARC authorization skill and grade distribution to make sure it complies with cur-
       rent Air Force policy.
   2.3.2. Gaining Command:
       2.3.2.1. Set mobilization manpower requirements based on paragraph 2.4.
       2.3.2.2. Do not redesignate such ANG units to a different type of unit (for example, fighter to air-
       lift) without getting a new DAF/XPM letter authorizing the redesignation.
       2.3.2.3. Develop mobilization manpower requirements for ARC units. Provide manpower
       requirements to Headquarters Air National Guard Manpower and Organization Division (ANG/
       XPM) or HQ AFRC/XPM for use in developing and maintaining their MDS.
       2.3.2.4. Inform ANG or HQ AFRC that you are making specific manpower authorization changes
       before you make changes in MDS. Clearly explain the reason for the change. NOTE: You do not
       need to inform these offices before making force structure changes.
       2.3.2.5. Submit any disagreements that arise between you and the ANG or HQ AFRC on ARC
       and manpower authorizations to HQ USAF/XPM for resolution. Send a summary of the differ-
       ences and your recommendations to ANG/XPM, HQ USAF/REX, and HQ AFRC/XPM.
   2.3.3. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command:
12                                                                       AFI38-204 1 AUGUST 1999


        2.3.3.1. Use the gaining command MDS manpower requirements to create the manpower data-
        base for ANG or AFRC units.
        2.3.3.2. Establish manpower requirements needed for in-place mobilization and for managing,
        supporting, and training units in a nonmobilized status when the gaining command does not pro-
        vide this support. Incorporate these authorizations with the gaining command's mobilization man-
        power requirements and send the consolidated data to HQ USAF, the gaining MAJCOM, HQ
        AFPC, and the respective reserve units.
        2.3.3.3. Monitor unit programming actions to ensure unit designations are valid and Personnel
        Accounting Symbol (PAS) codes are available. Confirm and communicate unit designation and
        PAS codes to gaining commands as soon as they complete programming actions. NOTE: Only
        ANG may allocate manpower resources, to include skill-level and grade, and prepare manpower
        documents for ANG state headquarters according to approved Air Force staffing guides.

2.4. Establishing Manpower Requirements:
     2.4.1. Criteria. The Air Force bases manpower authorizations approved for ARC units on:
     Established manpower standards and guides, support agreements, and programming documents.
     Approved Unit Type Codes (UTC).
     Information and automated manpower file excerpts exchanged among gaining and host commands,
     the NGB, HQ AFRC, ANG, and HQ USAF.
     2.4.2. Requirements for Gained Units. Commands will establish mobilization manpower require-
     ments for gained ARC component units. These requirements state the manpower resources needed to
     augment the Active Forces in wartime and contingencies. NOTE: Obtain ANG/XPM or HQ AFRC/
     XPM coordination before placing mobilization manpower requirements in the Manpower Data Sys-
     tem. Use the required grade of the Active Force unit manpower document (UMD) and standards for
     like functions to determine ARC required grades.
     2.4.3. Requirements for In-place and Nonmobilized Units. The ANG and HQ AFRC will deter-
     mine manpower requirements needed for in-place mobilization and for managing, supporting, and
     training Guard and Reserve units in a nonmobilized status.
        2.4.3.1. With justification for change, state whether the action was started by the gaining com-
        mand or is a peacetime requirement authorized by this chapter.
        2.4.3.2. ANG or HQ AFRC maintains the authorization changes requests (ACR) for authoriza-
        tions included in the ANG or AFRC MDS.
     2.4.4. Documents. The USAF Program Guidance (PG) and USAF Program, Installations, Units and
     Priorities (PD) documents provide the numbers and types of ARC units programmed by time period
     and unit location. HQ USAF/XPM uses the Manpower Transaction Report to monitor manpower pro-
     grams established for ANG and AFRC units.

2.5. Changes in Grade. Units may specify military grades that differ from those specified in the gaining
command's standard statement. This flexibility enables them to respond to management problems inher-
ent to the unit. Except as allowed by paragraph 2.5., however, the total officer and airman authorized
AFI38-204 1 AUGUST 1999                                                                          13


grades in the UMD will not exceed those indicated as required by the gaining command. Justify such
changes by referring to this paragraph.
   2.5.1. Airman Grade Changes. Keep all airman authorized grade changes within the required
   AFSC and skill level spread shown in the governing directive by the gaining command. Further, do
   not change the gaining command's approved grade more than one grade within each skill level. For
   example, you may substitute a technical sergeant AFSC 3A071 for either a staff sergeant or master
   sergeant.
   2.5.2. Officer Grade Changes. Keep all officer authorized grade changes within the required AFSC
   and skill level spread grade spread authorized in the governing directive for the gaining command
   required AFSCs. Further, do not change the gaining command grades more than one grade level. For
   example, you may substitute a major for either a captain or a lieutenant colonel.
   2.5.3. Restriction. Commands may not use this grade realignment guidance to shift grades between
   gaining command wartime requirements and ARC additive requirements approved for in-place mobi-
   lization for managing, supporting, and training units in a nonmobilized status.

                                                 Chapter 3

            INDIVIDUAL MOBILIZATION AUGMENTEE (IMA) AUTHORIZATIONS

3.1. Definition. IMA authorizations are individual military Air Force Reserve assets functioning as a
total force multiplier to augment the Air Force in war, contingency operations, and peacetime to meet
National Defense, strategic national interest, and domestic objectives.

3.2. Criteria. As provided for in Department of Defense Directive 1235.11, IMA authorizations may be
established to support mobilization (including pre and/or post mobilization requirements), contingency
operations, operations other than war, or other specialized or technical requirements to augment the active
duty component structure. Use the following guidelines when validating IMA manpower requirements:
     3.2.1. Mobilization. To support the two Major Theaters of War (2 MTWs), deployed and
     stay-at-home backfill manpower requirements, for which Active and unit Air Reserve Component
     forces are of insufficient quantity. HQ USAF/XPMR will provide to MAJCOM Directors of Man-
     power, Organization, and Quality a list of manpower requirements by AFSC that fit this criteria after
     each Total Force Assessment.
     3.2.2. Contingency Operations and Operations Other Than War (OOTW). The principal use of
     IMAs under this criterion is in support of manpower requirements related to Expeditionary Aerospace
     Forces, as follows: (a) to backfill active duty positions that deploy from an Aerospace Expeditionary
     Force (AEF) location, (b) fill a recurring AEF deployment requirement, or (c) augment Air Staff,
     MAJCOM and Numbered Air Force staff functions that must expand operations during these opera-
     tions. The key basis for IMAs justified under this category is that the IMA position will either reduce
     the PERSTEMPO of the active force, provide workload relief for units that lose personnel on steady
     state deployment requirements, or augment MAJCOM or Numbered Air Force staffs not manned to
     handle the expanded hours associated with contingency operations or OOTW.
     3.2.3. Specialized, Technical, or Scientific. To augment Active Forces when the workload is mis-
     sion essential and to maintain a military capability requiring specialized, technical, or scientific
     knowledge or experience in scope not available in the active duty force.
     3.2.4. Economic. To augment Active Forces when the workload is mission essential and the cost of
     IMA augmentation is less than alternative manpower resources. To meet the economic criterion,
     funding for the new IMA manpower positions must be offset by funds from existing programs or on
     the basis that funding will be requested in the PPBS process when IMAs provide a more economic
     alternative than manpower in existing or proposed programs. NOTE: IMA REQUESTS, UNDER
     THE ECONOMIC CRITERION, MUST IDENTIFY THE RESOURCES BY FISCAL YEAR, PRO-
     GRAM ELEMENT, AND APPROPRIATION TO BE USED TO FUND THE IMA REQUIRE-
     MENT.
     3.2.5. Management and Training of AFRC Personnel. Management and training of AFRC per-
     sonnel in the IMA program, can be used as partial justification for an IMA authorization, when the
     command can demonstrate that:
        Proficiency in the IMA's primary responsibilities will not be degraded.
        Use of Reservists is economical.
        An IMA will exercise the leadership and management skills required of the position and rank.
AFI38-204 1 AUGUST 1999                                                                                15


3.3. Additional Guidelines.
   3.3.1. IMA Wartime Authorizations. Before requesting IMA authorizations to satisfy wartime
   requirements, designate manpower made available by planned wartime reductions or eliminating
   peacetime workloads.
   3.3.2. Overseas IMA Authorizations. Air Force component commands in overseas theaters must
   state unified command operations plan (OPlan) augmentation requirements in Time-Phased Force
   and Deployment Lists (TPFDL), using the Manpower Force Packaging Systems (MANFOR). See
   AFMAN 10-401, Operation Plan and Concept Plan Development and Implementation, for direction.
   NOTE: Air Force manpower activities align IMA authorizations for overseas commands under the
   "pool" concept. That is, the individuals must reside in-theater and must relinquish their IMA assign-
   ments to the command when they move outside the augmented theater.
   3.3.3. Centrally Managed/Single Managed Programs. IMAs with AFSCs in the chaplain, medical
   and legal career fields are designated as "centrally managed" at the Air Reserve Personnel Center
   (ARPC). Similarly, HQ AFOSI and the Air Intelligence Agency (AIA) are "single managers" for all
   IMAs in the Office of Special Investigations and intelligence AFSCs, respectively. All requests for
   new IMA authorizations with AFSCs in these areas must be coordinated with the appropriate program
   manager at ARPC, AIA, or HQ OSI.

3.4. Restrictions. IMAs may not be authorized for the following purposes:
   3.4.1. To augment the Reserve Component force structure.
   3.4.2. To augment Air National Guard units.
   3.4.3. To replace military personnel expected to be unavailable for duty because of leave, hospitaliza-
   tion, professional military education, or other temporary reason.
   3.4.4. To replace civilian employees who are Ready Reservists of the military services.
   3.4.5. IMA administrative management when that is the sole justification for an IMA requirement.
   NOTE: Commands may assign administrative management as an additional duty to senior IMA posi-
   tions that have a valid primary tasking. Active-duty personnel within the command retain primary
   responsibility for managing IMA program operations.

3.5. Requirements Validation Process. Processes for validating IMA requirements stem from responsi-
bilities delineated in Department of Defense Directive 1235.11.
   3.5.1. Requests for IMA requirements generated within USAF Major Commands will be initiated by
   the using organization; coordinated with the using Reserve Advisor/Program Manager and Centrally
   Managed/Single Managed Program Manager, as appropriate; and forwarded to the MAJCOM man-
   power office for review, coordination, validation, and approval consideration.
   3.5.2. Requests for IMA requirements generated within, the Joint Staff and Unified Combatant Com-
   mands, or other organizations and agencies external to the United States Air Force will be processed
   in accordance with DOD Directive 1235.11. Subsequent to review, validation and prioritization by
   the appropriate authority, new IMA requirements will be submitted through HQ USAF/XPM to HQ
   USAF/REX for review and resourcing options.
16                                                                           AFI38-204 1 AUGUST 1999


     3.5.3. Requests for IMA requirements generated within organizations other than those identified in
     3.5.1. and 3.5.2. (e.g., the Air Staff) will be initiated by the using organization; coordinated with the
     using Reserve Advisor/Program Manager and Centrally Managed/Single Managed Program Manager,
     as appropriate; and forwarded through appropriate manpower channels to the 11th Wing Manpower
     Office for review, coordination, validation and approval consideration.
     3.5.4. Copies of all validated IMA request forms for IMA requirements will be forwarded by the
     approving authority to ARPC/XP.
     3.5.5. All validated IMA positions will be monitored by ARPC. ARPC will instruct user organiza-
     tions to delete IMA requirements for other than wartime mobilization requirements from manpower
     requirement documents if such positions are not funded and filled within three years of validation.

3.6. IMA Funding Process. IMA resources are part of the Air Force Reserve appropriation and are pro-
grammed and managed by HQ USAF/RE. HQ ARPC/XP is the executive agent for reviewing, processing
and making recommendations to HQ USAF/RE for funding IMA requirements. All decisions pertaining
to the funding of IMA resources will be made by HQ USAF/RE unless delegated.
     3.6.1. Requesting IMA Authorizations. Once IMA requirements are validated, requests to fund
     these new requirements are sent to HQ ARPC/XP. Requests must include a proposed funding strat-
     egy. Strategies include realigning resources already used by the command and requests for new fund-
     ing in the next budget exercise (POM). HQ ARPC/XP will forward a recommendation to HQ USAF/
     RE for consideration. HQ ARPC/XP will notify the requesting organization of the decision.

3.7. General Officer Authorizations. The Reserve General Officer Baseline Study periodically reviews
and validates requirements and authorizations for General Officers and Mobilization Assistants. The
study is the basis for changes in authorizations to the gaining command for inclusion in the MDS. HQ
USAF/REPS is the OPR for the Baseline Study.

3.8. Reporting Requirements.
     3.8.1. Manpower Data System (MDS). Procedures are provided in AFI 38-204, Chapter 7, and
     AFM 38-142, Volume 2, MDS Software User's Manual, to create and maintain MDS Current Require-
     ment Authorization (CRA) tables and report outgoing external interface increments sent to both Head-
     quarters Air Force-Manpower Data System (HAF MDS) and the Personnel Data system (PDS).
     3.8.2. Total Authorized Air Force Reserve IMA Positions. To identify total Air Force Reserve
     IMA authorizations, use the data elements in the Air Force Corporate Data Dictionary (AFCDD)
     on-line. Use Code 3 to identify authorized Air Force Reserve IMA positions assigned to Air Force
     organizations and Codes 4-9 to identify authorized Air Force Reserve IMA positions in non-Air Force
     organizations. All IMA authorizations will be coded to reflect validation based on either a wartime
     manpower shortfall requirement or other requirements.

                                    THE TRANSIENT ACCOUNT

4.1. Purpose. The transient account provides military manpower authorizations to offset duty time lost
by Air Force officers and airmen in travel, proceed, and leave status with PCS. The transient account cov-
ers all PCS moves except unit moves and separation moves within the CONUS.

4.2. Types of PCS Moves:
   4.2.1. Accession. Officer and enlisted personnel PCS moves from entry point into active service:
   Directly to first permanent duty station (for prior service personnel).
   From final period of initial entry training to first permanent duty station (for nonprior service person-
   nel).
   4.2.2. Operational: HQ USAF- and command-directed intercommand and intracommand officer
   and enlisted personnel PCS moves between CONUS duty stations or between overseas duty stations
   when transocean travel is not involved.
   HQ USAF-directed consecutive overseas tour (OT) moves when transocean travel is not involved.
   4.2.3. Rotational. HQ USAF- and command-directed officer and enlisted personnel moves to and
   from overseas and between overseas locations when transocean travel is involved. Rotational
   includes:
      Officer and enlisted personnel moves as a result of activation, inactivation, reorganization, and
   school, regardless of length.
      Moves without personnel and equipment (WOPE) when unit transocean is involved (excludes
   accession and separation moves).
   4.2.4. Separation. A general term that covers:
      Discharge.
      Release from active duty.
      Release from custody and control of the Armed Forces.
      Transfer to a Reserve component.
     Travel of officers and enlisted personnel from last CONUS or overseas permanent duty station to
   home of record, point of entry into service, or home of selection when authorized by law.
      Travel of officers and enlisted personnel when separated at overseas duty stations to overseas home
   of record, point of entry into service, or home of selection when authorized by law.
   4.2.5. Training. Student officers, enlisted personnel, and officer candidates (graduated and
   eliminees) in CONUS PCS moves from previous CONUS permanent duty station to, from, and
   between education and training courses lasting at least 20 weeks. Training does not include under-
   graduate flying training schools that award an aeronautical rating.

4.3. Transient Account Guidance and Procedures:
18                                                                         AFI38-204 1 AUGUST 1999


     4.3.1. Transient Manpower:
        4.3.1.1. The PCS move program drives transient manpower requirements.
        4.3.1.2. HQ USAF calculates transient manpower as man-year equivalents.
        4.3.1.3. HQ USAF centrally holds transient manpower. Transient manpower is not shown in the
        Manpower Data System (MDS). This ensures that the commands' UMD shows only the autho-
        rized manpower resources needed to support assigned mission.
     4.3.2. Exclusions. Transient entitlements exclude:
        Military personnel taking part in an organized unit move.
        Former military personnel in travel status from separation point to home of record.
        Military personnel on temporary duty for training status while enroute PCS.
        Military personnel on leave or temporary duty status who will return to the same duty unit.
        Military personnel house-hunting in conjunction with a PCS move.

4.4. Responsibilities:
     4.4.1. HQ USAF/XPM: Serves as the OPR for the transient account.
        Justifies, defends, and plans manpower requirements for the transient account.
     4.4.2. HQ USAF/DPF: Justifies the transient program within the military personnel program.
         Gives HQ USAF/XPM PCS move requirements and other functions required for development of
     transient account man-years.
        Provides data on trained personnel requirement and rated personnel.
     4.4.3. The Air Force Center for Quality, Management and Innovation (AFC QMI):
        Determines the criteria by which HQ USAF/XPM plans transient manpower requirements.
        Determines the criteria by which HQ USAF/DPF calculates transient entitlements by command,
     grade, skill and type of PCS move. Uses average transient time, projected authorizations, unit prece-
     dence ratings, and the PCS move program, excluding unit moves.
        Monitors PCS movement and transient man-year usage with AFPC to manage transient entitle-
     ments.

                          OVERSEAS MANPOWER CONSIDERATIONS

5.1. Ceilings. US activities in foreign countries are of special political and economic interest to the
United States and foreign governments. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), working with
higher authorities, establishes overseas ceilings to control US DoD activities in particular areas, regions,
and countries.

5.2. Guidance:
   5.2.1. Unless HQ USAF or a higher authority specifies otherwise, overseas manpower ceilings
   include all permanent party military authorizations.
   5.2.2. HQ USAF designates, as the Air Force executive agent, the MQ office of the Air Force compo-
   nent to the unified CINC for the geographic area.
   5.2.3. The executive agent administers and monitors the Air Force portion of the ceiling. The agent:
       Notifies other Air Force MAJCOMs and FOAs of their portion of the ceiling.
       Makes sure that MAJCOMS and FOAs don't exceed ceiling limits unless a higher authority so
   authorizes.
      Makes sure that ceilings provide only the minimum manpower needed for mission accomplish-
   ment.
   5.2.4. Executive agents, MAJCOMs, and FOAs may directly communicate on ceiling limitations.
   Executive agents may directly communicate with the unified command staff that controls the ceiling
   they administer.
   5.2.5. HQ USAF/XPMP notifies executive agents of ceiling limitations and makes sure that MAJ-
   COMs and FOAs comply with them.
   5.2.6. MAJCOMs and FOAs affected by manpower ceilings make sure that UMD manpower autho-
   rizations do not exceed ceiling limitations.

5.3. Ceiling Increases:
   5.3.1. To increase an Air Force ceiling, the executive agent sends a written explanation of why the
   need exists to the appropriate unified command staff, with an information copy to HQ USAF/XPMP.
   5.3.2. To increase a MAJCOM ceiling, the MAJCOM or FOA sends a written explanation of why the
   need exists to the executive agent, with an information copy to HQ USAF/XPMP. The executive
   agent approves or disapproves the MAJCOM request if it falls within the established Air Force ceil-
   ing.

5.4. Overseas Rotation Index. The Air Force also monitors overseas requirements to ensure military
manpower authorizations exist in the CONUS, in each support Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), to pro-
vide a sufficient rotation and training base. HQ USAF/XPMR will periodically analyze cumulative
impact of programming actions including CS&P on existing CONUS rotation base. The Air Force goal is
to allow airmen to serve no more than 8 involuntary years overseas during a 20-year career.

                                                Chapter 6

                                      USE OF MILITARY MANPOWER

6.1. Types of Manpower. The Air Force uses three types of manpower to perform required work:
     Military personnel.
     In-service civilian employees.
     Contract services.
     6.1.1. Use of Military Personnel. In accordance with DoD guidance, the Services assign military
     personnel only to positions that:
        Directly contribute to prosecution of war (combat or direct combat support).
        Are military by law.
        Are military by custom or tradition.
        Are needed for overseas rotation, operational deployment augmentation, career field sustainment.
     6.1.2. Use of Nonmilitary Personnel. For indirect combat support, use in-service civilian employees
     or contract services.
     6.1.3. MAJCOM. In this chapter the term MAJCOM includes FOAs and DRUs.

6.2. Responsibilities.
     6.2.1. HQ USAF/XPM: Is the OPR for military essentiality.
       Sees that MAJCOMs follow DoD policies and procedures when identifying manpower positions as
     military essential.
     6.2.2. MAJCOM . XPMs ensure that their commands follow DoD and Air Force directives on mili-
     tary essentiality.
     6.2.3. Servicing manpower activities: Code each manpower authorization in the MDS for military
     essentiality.
        Follow policies and procedures on military essentiality when establishing new manpower positions
     or considering conversion of current positions.
        Review positions for military essentiality when a major mission or duty change occurs.
       Coordinate all actions involving civilian manpower authorizations with the servicing civilian per-
     sonnel office.

6.3. Manpower Mix. Military essentiality is the determinant of the Air Force manpower mix.
     6.3.1. Nonmilitary Work. Use in-service civilian employees or contract services to perform work
     not requiring military personnel. NOTE: In work centers where civilian authorizations have been
     abolished as a result of a civilian reduction in force (RIF), MAJCOMs may not assign military or
     overage military personnel to perform the tasks formerly performed by in-service civilian employees.
AFI38-204 1 AUGUST 1999                                                                                21


   Functional managers may maintain the workload with the work center's residual military including
   IMAs as specified in paragraph 3.2.4. or civilian personnel.
   6.3.2. Military Work. When currently authorized civilian positions are identified as military essen-
   tial, commands should convert the civilian authorization to military through attrition unless mission
   requirements dictate a faster conversion. Coordinate all conversions in functions affecting Air
   National Guard or Air Force Reserve forces training with HQ Air Force Reserve Center or the
   National Guard Bureau.
   6.3.3. Manpower Mix Decision Process. Attachment 2 and Table 6.1. through Table 6.3. describe
   the manpower mix decision process.

6.4. Military Essentiality Status (MES) Coding:
   6.4.1. General Guidelines for MAJCOMs:
      6.4.1.1. Do not create new military manpower positions unless they satisfy military-essentiality
      criteria. Use Table 6.1. in your decision process.
      6.4.1.2. Code each position identified as military essential in the MDS using MES data field with
      the appropriate alpha code.
      6.4.1.3. Do not use MES codes on a civilian position unless:
         It is an Air Reserve Technician (ART) or Air Technician (AT) position.
         It is in a function undergoing a cost comparison or direct conversion.
         It is in a function that remained in-house after a cost comparison.
      6.4.1.4. Determine military essentiality on the basis of the requirements of the position or need to
      maintain capability rather than the characteristics of the incumbent.
      6.4.1.5. Supporting rationale for each military-essential position will be documented based on
      DoD Force Mix Codes implemented in the Defense Reform Initiative Directive (DRID) # 20,
      Inherently Governmental Review.
      6.4.1.6. Review military-essential positions annually for currency and compliance to criteria. Use
      Table 6.1. in your decision process.
   6.4.2. MES Codes:
      6.4.2.1. Code A. Designates as military essential those positions that:
         Perform combat or direct combat support functions.
         Require previous military training.
         Are dictated by tradition or custom.
         Require current military experience.
        Require incumbents to exercise direct command authority over military subordinates under the
      Uniform Code of Military Justice.
         The law requires.
22                                                                       AFI38-204 1 AUGUST 1999


           Are indirect combat support positions tasked by a HQ USAF-approved contingency or war
       plan.
          Require skills not available in the civilian community.
       6.4.2.2. Code J. Designates civilian positions for which the incumbent must be one of the follow-
       ing:
          An Air Reserve Technician (ART) assigned to the Air Force Reserve.
          An Air Technician (AT) assigned to the Air National Guard.
NOTE: ARTs and ATs have dual status as military members of the Selected Reserve and as civil service
employees.
       6.4.2.3. Code R. Designates military or civilian positions in a function undergoing an in-house
       (versus contract) cost comparison or direct conversion.
       6.4.2.4. Code S. Designates civilian positions in a function that remained in-house after undergo-
       ing a cost comparison.

Terms
End Strength —The count of the Air Force military and civilian positions which the Air Force has
funded in each year of the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) to accomplish all approved missions.
End strength provides the basis for funded man-years within the personnel system, and provides the target
for personnel plans, programs, and budgets. End strength is a resource provided to support approved
force structure, programs, or missions. End strength changes do not drive force structure or missions
changes; they are tied to programmatic increases and decreases in force structure or mission. FYDP end
strength is allocated to commands by program element code and category.
Manpower Authorization —A funded manpower requirement with detail which defines the position in
terms of its function, organization, location, skill, grade, and other appropriate characteristics which
commands use to extend end strength resources to units.
Manpower Data System (MDS) —The official source of manpower authorization data for the active
duty Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve. The system receives manpower authorization
allocations from the HQ Air Force Manpower System, organization data from the Personnel Accounting
38                                                                            AFI38-204 1 AUGUST 1999


Symbol System, and contingency planning data from the manpower and personnel system. The
Manpower Data Systems provides authorization data to the Personnel Data Systems for recruitment,
training and assignment actions and to wing and unit commanders for peacetime and contingency
planning actions.
Manpower Requirement —Joint Pub 1-02 defines manpower requirements simply as human resources
needed to accomplish specified work loads of organizations. More specifically, the manpower is needed
to accomplish a specified job, workload, mission, or program. There are two types of manpower
requirements: funded and unfunded. Funded manpower requirements are those that have been validated
and allocated. Unfunded requirements are validated manpower needs that have been deferred because of
budgetary constraints.
Military Essential —Positions that directly contribute to prosecution of war (combat or direct combat
support), exercise Uniform Code of Military Justice authority, are required by law, are military due to
custom or tradition, are needed for overseas rotations, or require a skill not available in civilian resources.
Other workloads are not military essential and should be performed by in-service civilians or contract
services.
Out-of-Cycle Actions —Changes to military authorizations effective in the current or two succeeding
fiscal quarters or changes to civilian authorizations effective during the current quarter.
Unit Authorization File (UAF) —A file within the Manpower Data System containing all manpower
attributes (data fields) applied to authorizations: for example, functional account code, Air Force specialty
code, program element code, personnel accounting symbol, etc.

                              MANPOWER MIX DECISION PROCESS
The following steps describe the decision process used to determine type of manpower (military, civilian,
or contract service) to use when validating manpower requirements. See Figure 6.1. for a graphic illustra-
tion.
Step 1. Validated Manpower Requirement. A validated manpower requirement is a unit of work, usu-
ally expressed in whole man-years that a MAJCOM XPM recognizes as a requirement for mission accom-
plishment. After validating a manpower requirement, the MAJCOM goes to step 2.
Step 2. Is Military Incumbency Required for Unit Mission? To answer this basic question, review
Table 6.1., rules 1 through 11. If the answer is yes, go to step 3. If the answer is no, go to step 13.
Step 3. Is Full-time Capability Required? Decide whether the work must be performed during wartime
only and need not be performed daily during peacetime. If the answer is no, go to step 4. If yes, go to step
5.
Step 4. Provide Air Reserve Force Authorization. Identify the workload requirement to HQ USAF/XP
so that it can give the proper Air Reserve Force authorization.
Step 5. Are Active Military Skills Available? Check AFIs 36-2105 and 36-2108 to determine whether
proper Air Force Specialty Codes exist to perform the workload. You may need to check with the MAJ-
COM personnel office and with AFPC/DPP to determine if military skills are available. If yes, go to step
6. If no, go to step 7.
Step 6. Provide Active Military Authorization. The MAJCOM gives active military authorization.
Step 7. Is There a Legally Contractable Workload? Check with the MAJCOM or installation con-
tracting office to determine whether the workload is legally contractable according to FAR part 37, para-
graph 37.104, which prescribes personal services contracts. If yes, go to step 8. If no, go to step 10.
Step 8. Are Contract Services Available? If the MAJCOM or installation contracting office determines
that contract services are available, go to step 9. If not, go to step 10.
Step 9. Interim Contract Until Resources Available. The MAJCOM approves an interim contract until
military resources can be planned and made available.
Step 10. Are Civilian Skills Available? The MAJCOM or local civilian personnel office determines
whether civilian skills are available. If no, go to step 11. If yes, go to step 12.
Step 11. Surface to HQ USAF. The MAJCOM or local civilian personnel office recommends alterna-
tives to HQ USAF for resolution.
Step 12. Interim Use of Civilians Until Resources Available. The MAJCOM approves interim use of
civilians until military resources can be planned and made available.
Step 13. Is Military Incumbency Required for Air Force-wide Mission? Review Table 6.1., rules 9
through 13. If the answer is yes, go to step 3. If no, go to step 14.
Step 14. Is In-Service Civilian Incumbent Required? Review Table 6.1., rules 1 through 9. If yes, go
to step 15. If no, go to step 23.

Step 15. Are Civilian Skills Available? See step 10 for review procedures. If yes, go to step 16. If no,
go to step 17.
Step 16. Provide Civilian Authorization. The MAJCOM gives civilian authorization.
Step 17. Are Active Military Skills Available? See step 5 for review procedures. If yes, go to step 18.
If no, go to step 19.
Step 18. Interim Use of Military Until Resources Available. The MAJCOM approves interim use of
military personnel until civilian resources can be programmed and made available.
Step 19. Is There a Legally Contractable Workload? See step 7 for procedures. If no, go to step 20.
If yes, go to step 21.
Step 20. Surface to HQ USAF. See step 11.
Step 21. Are Contract Services Available? See step 8 for procedures. If yes, go to step 22. If no, go to
step 20.
Step 22. Interim Contract Until Resources Available. See step 9.
Step 23. Is There a Legally Contractible Workload? See step 7. If yes, go to step 24. If no, go to step
27.
Step 24. Are Contract Services Available? See step 8. If yes, go to step 25. If no, go to step 27.
Step 25. Are Contract Services Less Expensive? When mission changes or wartime taskings dictate a
review of a commercial activity, a cost comparison is appropriate. To do the review, compare all relevant
costs. If yes, go to step 26. If no, go to step 27.

Step 26. Procure Contract Services. The contracting office procures contract services.
Step 27. Are Civilian Skills Available? See step 10 for procedures. If yes, go to step 28. If no, go to
step 29.
Step 28. Are Civilian Authorizations Provided? The MAJCOM gives civilian authorization.
Step 29. Are Military Skills Available? See step 5 for procedures. If yes, go to step 30. If no, go to step
31.
Step 30. Interim Use of Military Until Resources Available. The MAJCOM approves interim use of
military personnel until civilian resources can be programmed and made available.
Step 31. Surface to HQ USAF. Recommended alternatives must be surfaced to HQ USAF for resolution.
