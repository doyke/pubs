                UNIT ENVIRONMENTAL COORDINATOR (UEC) DUTIES

3.1. Scope. This section describes the duties and responsibilities of the UEC as identified by the
HW Subcommittee in conjunction with the Environmental, Safety & Occupational Health
Council (ESOHC). UECs must be qualified to evaluate processes or facilities for environmental
compliance and must therefore attend the UEC training offered annually. This qualification will
be documented using AF Form 55, AF Form 623 or other approved record keeping system.
Organizations are required to appoint one UEC and a minimum of one alternate to perform the
following duties.
     3.1.1. Serve as the focal point for all environmental issues in the organization as relates to
     Hazardous Materials, Hazardous Waste, waste reduction, and recycling initiatives. The UEC
     will act as a focal point for all authorizations pertaining to EESOH-MIS Chemical/Hazardous
     Materials Request Authorization. They will ensure that all authorized personnel are
     thoroughly familiar with the authorization process.
     3.1.2. Report to the Group Commander and/or Squadron Commander on Hazardous
     Waste/Hazardous Materials (HM) management issues (including administration, education,
     and regulatory issues).
     3.1.3. Prepare briefings, memos, and reports for squadron/group/wing commander(s) as
     required, on environmental issues affecting their unit’s mission.
     3.1.4. Maintain high degree of proficiency concerning knowledge of environmental policies
     pertaining to McConnell AFB’s mission and activities.
     3.1.5. Meet with the Haz-waste Office to discuss environmental compliance issues when
     required. Meetings will occur quarterly, unless circumstances require more frequent
     meetings.
     3.1.6. Notify the Haz-waste Office of all new waste streams, changes to current waste
     streams or processes and change of SAP managers. The Haz-waste Office will make the final
     waste decision and determine if a new SAP is needed.
     3.1.7. Serve as the focal point for recycling and pollution prevention initiatives within the
     organization. The base Pollution Prevention Program Manager is located in Bldg. 1096, the
     Hazardous Waste Office.
     3.1.8. Attend quarterly HM/HW & P2 Subcommittee meetings chaired by the Maintenance
     Group Commander. The Haz-waste Office will notify all UECs or their designated
     representative of the time and place of the meeting.
     3.1.9. Maintain a UEC Folder (see Section 3.2).
     3.1.10. Provide SAP Environmental Management Folders for each shop in the organization
     that generates HW.
     3.1.11. Schedule and ensure SAP Managers attend initial and annual refresher training for
     HW management. This training will be scheduled as needed through the Haz-waste Office.
MCCONNELLAFBI32-7002 29 MAY 2014                                                                9


   3.1.12. Ensure Tier I assessments of all work centers with HAZMAT or SAPs are conducted
   at least once per quarter. Checklist for Tier I assessments are located on Environmental’s E-
   Dash site or from the List builder web site. List builder web address and password will be
   provided by the Hazardous Waste Office.
       3.1.12.1. Tier 1 assessments are routine facility and workplace process reviews intended
       to ensure compliance with federal, state, and local laws or regulations and conformance
       with DoD, Air Force or installation instructions, policies, or other requirements.
       Assessment documentation serves as a record of compliance/noncompliance and can be
       used to identify areas for corrective action, lessons learned, or best practices.
       3.1.12.2. Documentation of instances of noncompliance and/or nonconformance found
       during Tier 1 assessments must identify corrective and preventive actions, even when the
       problem is immediately eliminated. Elimination of the immediate problem may not
       necessarily address the underlying root cause, which may only be properly addressed
       through corrective action. Significant findings must be immediately reported to the Unit
       Commander and to the appropriate installation-level functional office. For more complex
       issues (i.e., problems that cannot be immediately corrected), workplace personnel should
       contact the installation ESOH functional for assistance in identifying the root cause and
       appropriate corrective/preventive actions to ensure future compliance.
       3.1.12.3. Records of assessments must be maintained for one calendar year. Tier 1
       assessments will be reviewed during Tier 2 and Tier 3 assessments.
   3.1.13. Ensure that all applicable Waste Profile Sheets (WPS) are current and supported by
   current documentation [e.g., lab analysis or Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)]. The
   expiration date on a WPS is located in the upper left-hand corner (see Attachment 4).
3.2. Maintain a UEC folder either by hardcopy or electronically. This folder will include, at
a minimum, these tabs:

Table 3.1. UEC Folder Tabs.
 TAB             Contents

   4.2.1. Copies of MAFI 32-7002, Training Plan, Waste Profiles, Appointment letters and HW
   Management Plan may be kept in Share Point or E-Dash. If they are, their location will be
   annotated in the appropriate tab.
       4.2.1.1. Turn-in documents (i.e. AF form 2005 and/or DD form 1348-1A) may be kept
       electronically If this option is used a note in Tab D must list the location the forms are
       kept.
       4.2.1.2. Weekly SAP Inspection may be stored, with the consent of the HW Office, in
       alternate locations. If stored outside of the SAP folder the location must be annotated in
       the SAP folder.
   4.2.2. Waste Profile sheets are available on the Environmental Element’s E-Dash site. If
   these Profiles are being used by a UEC or SAP manager there is not a requirement for them
   to be signed but they must be current.
   4.2.3. The UEC or SAP manager must ensure the analytical they have on hand is current.
   This can be done by matching the sample ID numbers found on both the analytical report and
   the WPS.
   4.2.4. If E-Dash is being used, all members of the work center must be able to demonstrate
   the ability to retrieve the document in a reasonable amount of time.
MCCONNELLAFBI32-7002 29 MAY 2014                                                            11


  4.2.5. Responsible for knowing the source of all waste streams and contents of all waste
  containers.
  4.2.6. Whenever a new waste stream is generated, or changes occur to a current waste stream
  or process, the SAP Manager must notify the organization’s UEC.
  4.2.7. Maintains copy(s) of the current WPS for each waste stream, in a SAP, with attached
  documentation.
  4.2.8. Ensures that SAP signs are posted at all HW accumulation points and that the primary
  and alternate points of contact, including phone extension, are current. Signs must be posted
  at eye level directly above the accumulating container. If the accumulating container is in a
  metal locker (flammable cabinet or conex), the SAP sign must be posted on the exterior door.
  4.2.9. If the SAP is an accumulation area (more than one HW stream), the containers must
  be organized evenly beneath the SAP sign with HW labels facing out.
  4.2.10. SAP managers must ensure that container labeling meets all the requirements IAW
  Section 6.3.2. Pre-printed labels may be obtained from the Haz-waste Office.

                                           Chapter 5

                               CONTAINER MANAGEMENT

5.1. Scope. This section includes the proper container selection for the accumulation; storage,
proper handling, and transport of HW (see Attachment 8).
5.2. Container Distribution. The Haz-waste Office is the sole supplier for HW containers.
Pick-ups from SAPs are a one-for-one swap, with a new drum replacing the drum being
removed. A HW label will be affixed to the container with all but the last three lines completed.
SAP managers will be responsible for annotating the POC, organization, building number and
POC phone extension.
5.3. Weight. The maximum allowable weight of a filled 55-gallon container is 500 pounds.
5.4. Container Condition. Waste accumulation containers must be kept in good physical
condition (e.g., no rust, dents, deformations, holes, or extraneous markings) and must meet
Department of Transportation (DoT) approval per 49 CFR Part 271, 273 & 279. Containers
must also be kept sealed except when adding wastes.         To prevent accidental release the
container must be tightly sealed. Note: [Drum lids must be secured with the locking ring or
bung plug and must be wrench tight].
5.5. Corrugated Fiber. The use of corrugated fiber containers may be employed when
applicable. The most cost effective containers will be used to store HW when waste conditions
meet the container criteria for waste type accumulation (e.g., caustic in plastic containers). The
WPS will also recommend the appropriate container for that specific waste stream. Consult the
Haz-waste Office for questions relating to container type.
5.6. Day Containers, formerly known as Transfer Containers. A container used to transport
HW from the point of generation to the SAP. For example, a 5-gallon container used to collect
sludge from an anti-freeze reclaimer and then transport it to the HW container.
   5.6.1. Day containers will not exceed 5 gallons in capacity and will be labeled with the
   words “Day Container” and the name of the waste on the container. Day Containers will be
   emptied at the end of each shift per 40 CFR 261.7(b)(1).
   5.6.2. Approval must be obtained from the Haz-waste Office, Bldg 1096, before Day
   Containers can be used in a work center. As of Nov 2011 no work centers have approval for
   Day Containers.
   5.6.3. Triple rinsing of HW containers at McConnell AFB is prohibited without approval
   from the Hazardous Waste Office.
   5.6.4. Spill cleanup/containment materials will be readily available near all liquid HW
   accumulation. Spill pallets are recommended for 55-gallon drums.
       5.6.4.1. Corrosive HW will also have a neutralizing agent available in the event of a
       spill, in addition to cleanup/containment materials.
MCCONNELLAFBI32-7002 29 MAY 2014                                                                13


                                           Chapter 6

                             WASTE TURN-IN PROCEDURES

6.1. Scope. This section applies to all individuals who manage HW containers at a SAP.
6.2. When the container is deemed full ensure the full container is moved to the 90-Day
Hazardous Waste Storage Facility (HWSF) within 3 days with the appropriate label affixed
to the upper third of the container (see Attachment 7).
   6.2.1. If a new container is placed into service before the full container is removed. The date
   the container became full must be annotated on the Haz-Waste label. This date will be
   placed in the upper right hand corner of the label and read: FULL DATE: __________
       6.2.1.1. When the container is full, immediately notify the Haz-waste Office at 759-5347
       and give your name, organization, extension and a brief description of the waste and
       WPS number.
   6.2.2. During the pick-up, shop personnel must be available with a completed AF 2005 or
   have an electronic version that can be e-mailed to the Haz-Waste Office. In order to reduce
   paperwork AF form 2005 and DD form 1345-1A may be completed, transferred, and stored
   electronically. All information (Waste Description, Waste Code) needs to be annotated on
   the HW label from the profile and must be verified by the Haz-waste Office. If the waste is
   not removed from the shop within 48 hours from the initial contact, call the Haz-waste Office
   immediately at 759-5345 or 759-5346.
   6.2.3. After the pick-up has been made, the work center is responsible for maintaining the
   processed document AF Form 2005 (see Attachment 5) for one year from the date of the
   pick-up.
   6.2.4. For non-regulated waste, it is the responsibility of the generator to transport the waste
   to Bldg. 1096 for processing on Thursdays from 0800-1100. The turn-in procedure will be
   the same as for regulated waste in terms of required documents.
   6.2.5. The same turn-in procedures will apply to the Kansas Air National Guard (KANG)
   184 Intelligence Wing. SAP Managers will notify the Haz-waste Office at 759-5347 to
   coordinate the transport of HW containers to the 90-Days HWSF, Bldg 1096.
6.3. Waste labels. The following describes the requirements for labeling wastes generated on
McConnell AFB.
   6.3.1. Requirements. All labels will be placed on the upper one-third portion of the container
   and facing out so that it is clearly visible.
   6.3.2. Hazardous Wastes (HWs). All HW containers must be labeled (see Attachement 6).
   Enter your shop or organization phone extension; and for the accumulation start date, leave it
   blank. The EPA Waste number is obtained from the WPS under “RCRA Characterization.”
   On the three bottom lines, the SAP manager will annotate the point of contact, phone
   extension, unit, and building number or location.
   6.3.3. Non-Regulated Wastes. All non-regulated wastes must be labeled with a non-
   regulated waste label (see Attachment 7). The top three fields will be the same on all non-
 14                                            MCCONNELLAFBI32-7002 29 MAY 2014


   regulated wastes. The two lines at the bottom of the label will vary depending on the POC
   and waste type.
6.4. Unknown Wastes. Any wastes that have not been declared to be non-regulated by the Haz-
waste Office will be managed as HW.
MCCONNELLAFBI32-7002 29 MAY 2014                                                              15


                                           Chapter 7

                          ABANDONED WASTE PROCEDURES

7.1. Scope. This procedure will be followed for all waste containers found on MAFB that are
not properly labeled. If the owning organization can be identified by the Haz-waste Office, the
container will be returned to that organization for proper disposal and Sections 7.2-7.5 will not
apply.
7.2. Procedure and Initial Response. Any individual who notices a container of waste that is
unlabeled must do the following:
   7.2.1. Assume the waste is hazardous.
   7.2.2. If the container is unknown or leaking, immediately notify the MAFB Fire
   Department, extension 911.
   7.2.3. Even if the container is in good condition the Fire Department must be called if the
   content is unknown.
   7.2.4. Keep the area secure until the appropriate personnel respond.
   7.2.5. Upon notification of an “abandoned waste container,” the Haz-waste Office will
   respond to the site to determine the course of action to be taken. Based on the suspected
   contents of the container and the location, the Haz-waste Office will determine if an
   investigation needs to take place.
7.3. Storage and Disposal. Once the container has been properly secured, the Haz-waste Office
will transport the container to the 90-Day HWSF for sampling and final disposition.
7.4. Return to Organization. If at any time during this process the organization responsible for
the abandoned waste container is determined, the owning organization will be contacted and will
be required to handle/process the container in the appropriate manner.
7.5. Investigation and Enforcement. If an investigation is determined to be necessary, the
Haz-waste Office will notify the Air Force Office of Special Investigation. Enforcement will be
determined based upon the result of the investigation, in coordination with the 22 ARW/JA, the
Haz-waste Office, and the base commander.

                          HEALTH AND PERSONNEL SAFETY

8.1. Scope. To protect the health and safety of Air Force personnel when working with HW.
8.2. Health.
   8.2.1. The health effects of HW can be categorized into: acute and chronic affects.
   8.2.2. Acute affects are reactions that are immediate and can include dizziness, nausea, light-
   headedness, burns, and tightness of chest, incapacitation, and death. An example of an acute
   effect would be burnt skin from contact with an acid.
   8.2.3. Chronic affects are due to multiple exposures over a period time before symptoms
   occur. Some examples of chronic affects are: cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, and skin
   sensitivity.
   8.2.4. BEE is responsible for conducting a yearly base-line survey for HW work center
   evaluation. It is their responsibility to set exposure limits and determine what Personnel
   Protective Equipment (PPE) is required.
   8.2.5. The Haz-waste Office is responsible for characterizing waste streams generated in
   each work center and creating a WPS where appropriate.
8.3. Personnel Safety.
   8.3.1. Certain chemicals may react when exposed to various elements or other chemicals.
   The resulting reactions range from combustion to hazardous polymerization. For this reason
   it is important not to mix incompatible wastes.
   8.3.2. Examples of incompatible waste are: Oxidizers and Flammables, or Corrosives and
   Flammables. If the compatibility of waste or container is unknown, contact the Haz-waste
   Office, Bldg 1096 and provide them with all information available (which should be, at a
   minimum, the MSDS).
   8.3.3. Flammable HW must be protected from spark and ignition sources.
   8.3.4. Before adding waste to a flammable HW container, the container that is being poured
   must be bonded to the waste container.
   8.3.5. Flammable HW will be stored in a metal container, unless otherwise directed by the
   Haz-waste Office.
   8.3.6. HW must be stored in a compatible container, for example corrosive waste will not be
   stored in a metal drum.
   8.3.7. The proper PPE will be worn when handling HW. PPE requirements are established
   by BEE and/or the MSDS.
8.4. AFOSH Standards: All Air Force personnel must follow AFOSH Standards in order to
protect their health.
   8.4.1. AFOSH Standard 91-68 applies primarily to chemical storage, handling, use, and
   disposal.
MCCONNELLAFBI32-7002 29 MAY 2014                                                        17


  8.4.2. AFOSH Standard 91-501 contains requirements for the use of protective clothing and
  equipment for protection against the chemical and physical hazards of chemicals.

Terms
Best Management Practice— A measure or practice used to reduce the amount of pollution
entering surface water, air, land, or ground waters. Best management practices also include
treatment requirements, operating procedures, and practices to control runoff, spillage or leaks,
sludge or waste disposal, or drainage from raw material storage.
Container— Any portable device, in which material is stored, transported, treated, disposed of,
or otherwise handled.
Containment— The safe and correct procedure of isolating, containing, and preventing a HW
spill from spreading to the surrounding environment. Any such spread could cause
environmental pollution and/or extreme degradation to human health and the environment.
Contingency Plan— A document prescribing an organized, planned, and coordinated course of
action to be followed in case of a fire, explosion, or release of HW or HW constituents that could
threaten human health or the environment.
Discharge— The accidental or intentional spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting,
emptying, or dumping of waste into or onto any land, water or air.
Disposal Turn—in Document - A government form, DD Form 1348-1; issue receipt document
used to provide internal control.
Empty Container— A container from which all HW has been removed, using practices
commonly employed to remove materials from that type of container and that meets the
requirements of 40 CFR 261.7.
EPA HW Number— The number assigned by the EPA to each listed HW and to each
characteristic identified in 40 CFR 261, Subpart C. An example is D001 for lighter fluid.
EPA Identification Number— The number assigned by the EPA to the generator, transporter or
to the treatment, storage and disposal facility. The number assigned to McConnell AFB is KS
1571924140.

Generator— Any person, by site, whose act or process produces HW identified or listed in 40
CFR 261. McConnell AFB, as the holder of the EPA identification number, is the “generator” of
HW for the installation.
Ground water— Water below the land surface in a zone of saturation.
Hazardous Material— Any solid, liquid, or gaseous substance that poses a unique or
categorical hazard to human health or the environment. Many common materials in daily use in
the home or the workplace are hazardous materials. The most comprehensive list of hazardous
materials is presented in the DOT Hazardous Materials Table in 49 CFR 172.101.
Hazardous Substance— A material (included in a specific list of chemicals designated by EPA
in 40 CFR 302) that poses a threat to the environment when discharged or spilled. Hazardous
substances are regulated only when they are discharged in certain quantities (called reportable
quantities). In addition, all materials meeting the definition of HW have been defined by the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA)
as hazardous substances with a reportable quantity as listed in 40 CFR 302.
Hazardous Waste— A solid waste or combination of solid wastes that displays one or more
identifying characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity. The waste may:
cause or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality or an increase in serious, irreversible,
incapacitating, or reversible illness; or pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human
health or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed of, or otherwise
managed.
Incompatible Waste— A HW which is unsuitable for: 1) placement in a particular device or
facility because it may cause corrosion or decay of containment materials; or 2) commingling
with another waste or material under uncontrolled conditions because the commingling might
produce heat or pressure, fire or explosion, violent reaction, toxic dusts, mists, fumes or gases, or
flammable fumes or gases.
Ninety—day Storage Area - A non-permitted storage/consolidation facility that provides a
centralized facility for receiving, containerizing, and storing HW. Storage of waste is limited to
90 days, with the 90-day period starting when waste is first placed in the storage area.
Noncompliance— Violations of this HWMP and applicable federal and state regulations.
Noncompliance with the law is both a federal and state offense.
Oil water separator— Wastewater treatment equipment used to separate oil from water
consisting of a separation tank, which also includes the fore bay and other separator basins,
skimmers, weirs, grit chambers, and sludge hoppers. Note: Oil water separators can only handle
trace amounts of oil.
Operator— The person(s) responsible for the overall operation of a facility.
Recyclable Material and Recycled Material— A material that is used, reused, or reclaimed. A
used or reused material is either: 1) used in an industrial process to make a product; or 2)
employed in a particular function or application as an effective substitute for a commercial
product. A material is “reclaimed” if it is processed to recover a usable product or if it is
regenerated.
MCCONNELLAFBI32-7002 29 MAY 2014                                                                21


Satellite Accumulation Point— HW may be accumulated at or near the point of origination
without a HW permit, provided that no more than 55 gallons of HW, one quart of acutely
hazardous, or one quart of extremely HW are stored.
Solid Waste— Any garbage, refuse, or sludge from a waste treatment plant, water supply
treatment plant, or air pollution control facility and other discarded material, including solid,
liquid, semisolid, or contained gaseous material resulting from industrial, commercial, mining,
and agricultural operations and from community activities, not including solid or dissolved
material in domestic sewage or solid or dissolved material in irrigation return flows or industrial
discharges that are point sources subject to permits under the Federal Water Pollution Control
Act, or special nuclear or by-product material as defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, or
as defined in 40 CFR 261.2.
Spill— The accidental leaking, pouring, pumping, emitting, or dumping on or into any land or
water of controlled industrial waste, recyclable materials, or hazardous materials that, when
spilled, become uncontrolled industrial waste.
Storage— The holding of HW for a temporary period, at the end of which the HW is treated,
disposed of, or stored elsewhere.
Transportation— The movement of HW by air, rail, highway, or water.
Transporter— A person engaged in the off-site transportation of HW.
Treatment— Any method, technique, or process, which changes or is designed to change the
physical, chemical or biological character or composition of any HW or any material contained
therein, or removes or reduces its harmful properties or characteristics for any purpose,
including, but not limited to, energy recovery, material recovery, or reduction.

                      MCCONNELL AFB HW CONTINGENCY PLAN

A8.1. PURPOSE: The purpose of this plan is to establish policies and procedures if the HW
90-Day HWSF management contractor fails to perform due to default, termination, strike action
or national crises. This Plan applies wholly or in part to the transport of waste from the Satellite

responsibility of the commander to coordinate the requirements of this Contingency Plan.
A8.2. ASSIGNMENT OF TASKS: The 22d Civil Engineer Squadron Commander is
responsible for the successful implementation of this plan. The Commander should review the
plan annually to ensure the requirements are still valid. The Squadron Commander will:
   A8.2.1. Keep the 22d Mission Support Group Commander, Wing Commander and
   MAJCOM aware of any difficulties with the contractor or with implementation of this plan.
   A8.2.2. Determine if in-house civilian personnel is the most effective approach for continued
   performance in lieu of military personnel.
   A8.2.3. Coordinate the requirements of this contingency plan with all base organizations
   affected, including the Kansas Air National Guard in advance.
   A8.2.4. Direct Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) to assume supervisory position during
   interim of this contingency operation.
   A8.2.5. If required, request the contracting office to solicit bids or negotiate a new 90-Day
   Hazardous Waste Storage Facility management contract.
   A8.2.6. Direct QAE to adjust working schedule to accommodate HW turn-ins during the
   extended duty shifts.
   A8.2.7. Advise comptroller of the estimated operational cost if applicable.            Primarily

       procedure by calling x5347. CEAN’s HW personnel will respond and conduct all
       regulated waste pick-ups for transport to the 90-Day HWSF. All other waste (non-
       regulated) will be transported to Bldg. 1096 by the generator for processing.
       A8.3.3.2. Discarded aerosol cans, at accumulation points, will be the responsibility of the
       SAP managers, who will transport them to Bldg. 1096 for depletion.
