                                2 Patient Identifiers

      1. Patient’s full name with suffix (e.g., Jr, III)

      2. Patient’s Birth Date*
                 If date of birth is not clear, add last 4 of the sponsor’s SSN
Use these 2-patient identifiers when conducting patient care activities, to include:
 Administering and dispensing medications
 Before all treatments and procedures
 Collecting lab specimens
 Conducting the final time out
 Greeting patients at clinic reception desks, and at each step of the patient encounter
*Prior to any specimen collection, medication administration, transfusion, or treatment, ACTIVELY
involve the patient and as needed the family in the identification and matching process, asking for
example, “Please tell me your full name and DOB”. When active patient involvement is not possible
or the patient’s reliability is in question, the individual collecting the specimen, administering the
medication, blood transfusion, or treatment is responsible for identity verification. Note: The
involvement of a single caregiver is acceptable as long as the other components of patient
identification are satisfied.
         Exceptions:
        -When administering blood/blood products: Use the patient’s full name, FMP,
        and sponsor’s full social security number per 59 MDWI 44-107, Blood Products and
        Cellular Components.
        -Newborns: Use the patient’s full name, FMP, and the sponsor’s full social
         security number.
