                                                Chapter 1

                                                POLICIES

1.1. General. This instruction implements the basic policy for providing airlift in support of the Presi-
dent of the United States, the Vice President, and other Presidential directed missions. It applies to all
organizations and aircrews who are responsible for the operation and support of airlift aircraft flying mis-
sions in support of presidential requirements. Commanders at all levels must ensure their units are fully
aware of the importance and sensitivity of these missions. The guidance in this publication takes prece-
dence over any conflicting guidance issued by field units.

1.2. Deviations and Waivers. The HQ AMC Operations Management Division (AMC/A33) is OPR for
this instruction. Unless otherwise specified in cited source references, HQ AMC Director of Operations
(AMC/A3) is waiver authority. Submit requests to deviate from the guidance in this instruction, or for
specific waivers to operational procedures, to HQ AMC/A33 for disposition. HQ AMC Standardization/
Evaluation Division (AMC/A37V) is the POC for waivers to operational procedures. Aircrews should
contact 18 AF Tanker Airlift Control Center Current Operations (18 AF TACC/XOO) through the 18 AF
TACC Global Operations Division (or, Cell) (18 AF TACC/XOCG) to request deviations—TACC/XOO
will forward such requests to AMC/A33. Non-AMC aircrews will request authorization to deviate from
this instruction through their normal chains of command to their controlling MAJCOM Mobility Airlift
C2 Facility (Para. 1.7.9.) which, in turn, will forward the requests to 18 AF TACC/XOCG. Requests for
waivers to aircraft operating procedures will be through normal methods established IAW Mission Design
Series (MDS) guidance. When extraordinary conditions arise with such short notice as to preclude prior
approval for deviations or waivers, the aircraft commander may exercise command authority to deviate
from this instruction. In all such cases, aircraft commanders will furnish a written explanation to their
commanders within 24 hours, providing copies through channels to 18 AF TACC/XOO and HQ AMC/
A33.

1.3. Requisitioning Procedures. Instructions for obtaining this publication are posted to the AFDPO
WWW site at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil.

1.4. Distribution. MAJCOMs will establish a control system for distributing this regulation and
changes. Unit commanders provide copies of this instruction for all aircrew members and associated sup-
port personnel.
    1.4.1. At least one copy of this instruction will be maintained in each C-130, C-5, C-17 and KC-10
    squadron operations section, readily accessible to operations and aircrew personnel.
    1.4.2. Additionally, one copy will be maintained by each of the following:
       1.4.2.1. Each mission trip kit.
       1.4.2.2. Command Posts, Operations Centers and Air Mobility Control Centers (AMCC).
       1.4.2.3. Staff operations, all levels.
       1.4.2.4. Air Terminal Operation Centers (ATOC).
       1.4.2.5. Air Terminal Manager.
       1.4.2.6. Air Freight Manager.
AFI11-289 16 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                                5


       1.4.2.7. Fleet Service.
       1.4.2.8. Director, Airlift Operations, White House Military Office (WHMO).

1.5. Supplements. MAJCOMs may supplement this AFI after coordination with AMC, the lead com-
mand for this instruction. Forward a copy of all published supplements or chapters to the OPR, AMC/
A33, and to WHMO. Supplements and local procedures will not duplicate, alter, amend, or be less restric-
tive than the provisions of this basic AFI or of flight manual publications.

1.6. Operations Security (OPSEC). The responsibility for OPSEC associated with PHOENIX BAN-
NER, SILVER, and COPPER missions rests with all personnel involved. Limit the dissemination of per-
tinent information to those having operational and or leadership responsibilities. In reference to these
missions, and particularly to the travel of DVs on these missions, do not use the terminology “Phoenix
Banner,” “Phoenix Silver” or “Phoenix Copper” when using non-secure transmission modes (radio, tele-
phone, e-mail, FAX, fiber optics, etc.); rather, use the Global Decision Support System (GDSS) mission
numbers to identify these missions. Do not associate the names, duty titles or ranks of the DVs traveling
with any mission details unless using secure communications. Ensure all actions relevant to this regula-
tion comply with the guidance in AFI 10-1101, Operations Security.

1.7. Terminology.
   1.7.1. Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM). A SAAM is operated (other than by the 89th Air-
   lift Wing) to satisfy a requirement to pickup or deliver cargo and/or personnel at locations other than
   those established within the normal channel structure. It is a mission needing special consideration
   because of the number of passengers, weight of the cargo, size of the cargo, urgency, sensitivity of
   movement, or other special factors.
   1.7.2. PHOENIX BANNER. A SAAM supporting the President of the United States.
   1.7.3. PHOENIX SILVER. A SAAM supporting the Vice President of the United States.
   1.7.4. PHOENIX COPPER. A SAAM supporting White House-directed missions when not support-
   ing the President or Vice President.
   1.7.5. ALFA, BRAVO, and CHARLIE Alert. Alert definitions are expanded as follows when consti-
   tuted in support of PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER missions:
       1.7.5.1. ALFA Standby. Aircraft and aircrew capable of departing 1+00 hour after alert for C-130,
       C-17 and KC-10 and 1+30 hours for C-5.
       1.7.5.2. BRAVO Standby. Aircraft and aircrew capable of departing 3+00 hours after alert for
       C-130, KC-10 and C-17 missions, and 3+45 for C-5 missions.
       1.7.5.3. CHARLIE Standby. Aircraft and aircrew capable of entering crew rest within 2 hours
       after notification and becoming legal for alert 12 hours after entering crew rest. C-130 aircraft and
       aircrew will be capable of departing a maximum of 17+15 hours after entering crew rest. C-17 air-
       craft and aircrew will be capable of departing a maximum of 17+45 hours after entering crew rest.
       KC-10 and C-5 aircraft and aircrew will be capable of departing a maximum of 18+15 hours after
       entering crew rest. Aircrews may then be placed in ALFA, BRAVO, or tasked to fly.

    1.7.6. Load Time. The time established by WHMO Airlift Operations and PHOENIX BANNER
    users as the time aircraft doors are open and aircrew is ready to load cargo or equipment. All servicing
    activities should be accomplished prior to this time.
    1.7.7. Common Users of This Mission. The single POC for each of these users on a given flight is
    referred to as the troop commander.
       1.7.7.1. United States Secret Service (USSS).
       1.7.7.2. White House Communications Agency (WHCA).
       1.7.7.3. Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1).
       1.7.7.4. Senior Executive Service (SENEX), or (SES).
       1.7.7.5. Presidential Airlift Group (PAG).
    1.7.8. Banner Express. This expression refers to the deployment of aircraft, aircrews, maintenance
    personnel, support equipment, and a command element to sustain the anticipated high ops tempo of
    PHOENIX BANNER/SILVER operations within the continental United States (CONUS) during an
    election season.
    1.7.9. MAJCOM Mobility Airlift C2 Facility. This generic expression identifies Command and Con-
    trol (C2) facilities or organizations within an Air Operations Center (AOC) which provide command
    and control over mobility airlift missions. The following organizations are examples: Force Projection
    Operations Center (FPOC) within United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE); Air Mobility Divi-
    sion (AMD) within US Pacific Command Air Forces (PACAF) or US Central Command Air Forces
    (CENTAF); 18 AF TACC within AMC; and, others. NOTE: The expression Air Mobility Operations
    Control Center (AMOCC) is being phased out.

1.8. Airlift Priority—DoD Transportation Movement Priority System (DTMPS).
    1.8.1. DTMPS priority 1A1 applies to PHOENIX BANNER and PHOENIX SILVER missions.
    1.8.2. DTMPS priority 1B1 applies to PHOENIX COPPER missions.

1.9. Mission Tasking Authority. WHMO Airlift Operations validates PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER,
or COPPER missions and assigns SAAM numbers.
    1.9.1. C-130, C-5, C-17 and KC-10 Tasking:
       1.9.1.1. During Normal Duty Hours. WHMO Airlift Operations validates SAAM airlift requests
       to United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) J3, Operations Directorate (TCJ3).
       The TCJ3 forwards validated requests through 18 AF TACC/XOO to 18 AF TACC Mobility Man-
       agement (TACC/XOB), who will task the appropriate airlift wing via telephone, facsimile or other
       electronic means. AFRC taskings will be coordinated through HQ AFRC Command Center at
       DSN 497-0680 or 1-800-223-1784 (Extension 70680).
       1.9.1.2. Other Than Normal Duty Hours. WHMO Airlift Operations validates SAAM airlift
       requests to TCJ3 through 18 AF TACC. TCJ3 passes validated requests to 18 AF TACC/XOB
       through 18 AF TACC/XOO and informs 18 AF TACC Director of Operations (TACC/XOZ) and
       18 AF TACC Command and Control (TACC/XOC) of the new taskings. 18 AF TACC/XOB,
       through 18 AF TACC/XOC, then tasks the appropriate airlift wing/group through the associated
AFI11-289 16 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                         7


     Current Operations Squadron (OSS) or command post. AFRC taskings will be coordinated
     through HQ AFRC Command Center at DSN 497-0680 or 1-800-223-1784 (Extension 70680).
  1.9.2. Tasking Non-AMC Assets (PACAF / USAFE / CENTAF). WHMO Airlift Operations validates
  SAAM requests to TCJ3, who passes validated requests to 18 AF TACC/XOO. For US Pacific Com-
  mand (PACOM), US European Command (EUCOM) and US Central Command (CENTCOM) the-
  aters, the TCJ3 should contact the respective Joint Movement Center (JMC). The JMC then directs the
  appropriate theater or MAJCOM Mobility Airlift C2 Facility to contact 18 AF TACC/XOOO to coor-
  dinate mission details.

                                     AIRCREW PROCEDURES

2.1. Aircrew Mission Procedures. The Global Decision Support System (GDSS) provides detailed mis-
sion tasking information. Unless GDSS calls for an augmented aircrew, units will plan on using a basic
aircrew with three loadmasters on C-5 aircraft, two loadmasters on C-17 aircraft, and one loadmaster on
C-130 aircraft (two loadmasters or one loadmaster and another qualified aircrew member are required if
more than 40 passengers are carried on a C-130). On KC-10 aircraft, the basic aircrew should include an
extra boom operator if cargo operations are required, or an extra boom operator qualified to handle pas-
sengers (or an extra aircrew member knowledgeable in passenger procedures) when more than 31 total
people are on board. Normally, aircrew evaluations should not be scheduled during the mission.
    2.1.1. Aircrew Selection. Squadron commanders and operations officers will ensure that aircrew
    members chosen for these missions are certified IAW Para 2.1.2. and highly capable. Selection should
    be based on qualification, proficiency, experience, maturity, and mission complexity. As a minimum,
    the aircrew must be qualified and current to fly the aircraft’s lowest certified instrument approach
    minima capability (i.e., AFI 11-2C-17, V3, Para 6.42.3.2, Aircrews will not execute an actual CAT II
    ILS to minimums unless both pilots are current in CAT II ILS. The aircraft commander must have
    logged at least 100 hours in command since the current aircraft commander qualification).
       2.1.1.1. Aircraft Commanders. Squadron Commanders will select the aircraft commanders to
       command PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER missions from among their most qualified
       aircraft commanders. Selection is a judgment-call, based on the overall performance of candidate
       A/Cs and on their experience level since upgrade to A/C.
    2.1.2. Aircrew Certification. All aircrew members will complete the following training program and
    be certified prior to flying unsupervised on a PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER mission.
    Training will focus on the unique circumstances that differentiate this mission from other missions.
    Aircrew members may enter PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER mission training once they
    begin mission qualification training (airland only). Wings will establish and maintain PHOENIX
    BANNER training programs. As a minimum, the training program will consist of:
       2.1.2.1. An instructor-led, in-depth review of AFI 11-289, including a discussion of tasking and
       execution agencies for PHOENIX BANNER missions and how the aircrew will interface with
       these agencies. It must also include a discussion of POCs that the aircrew will have to coordinate
       with in case of diversion or delay, including the Air Force Advance Agent and the troop com-
       mander from the USSS, WHCA, HMX-1, and SENEX. The goal is to educate aircrew members
       on the interface required between aircrew members and the users.
       2.1.2.2. An open book examination of material covered in AFI 11-289, minimum passing score of
       80 percent, corrected to 100 percent.
       2.1.2.3. A memorandum of certification signed by the squadron commander or operations officer.
       For AMC, annotate certification on AF IMT 1381, Certification of Aircrew Training, and file
       under Tab 1, Section 1, of the individual’s Flight Evaluation Folder. The operations group com-
       mander (OG/CC) must review the Phoenix mission-series certifications at the Standardization/
       Evaluation (STAN/EVAL) Board. For other MAJCOMs, annotate on training letter of transmittal,
       ARMS, or AF IMT 1381 and file IAW MAJCOM directives.
AFI11-289 16 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                              9


  2.1.3. Briefings. The operating wing will brief the aircraft commander on all aspects of the mission.
  The aircraft commander will then brief the remainder of the aircrew. The aircraft commander or a des-
  ignated aircrew member will then discuss these aspects with the designated troop commander. The
  troop commander is the single POC representing the user. The aircraft commander will ascertain the
  identity of the troop commander prior to departure. The briefing will include the following:
     2.1.3.1. Mission number and priority.
     2.1.3.2. Airfields to be transited.
     2.1.3.3. Parking locations.
     2.1.3.4. Remain overnight (RON) restrictions. Fly mission as planned. To RON at an unplanned
     stop is problematic and normally will not be approved.
     2.1.3.5. Servicing at civilian airfields.
     2.1.3.6. Load, takeoff and landing times.
     2.1.3.7. Names and telephone numbers of contacts.
     2.1.3.8. Load information, to include cargo description, number of passengers, and name of high-
     est-ranking passenger (Distinguished Visitor (DV) code 6 and SES-1 or higher).
     2.1.3.9. Meal requirements.
     2.1.3.10. Security procedures.
     2.1.3.11. Command and Control (C2) Procedures. If the aircrew enters crew rest, the aircraft com-
     mander will ensure the troop commander is aware of the existing C2 at that location (local com-
     mand post, Tanker Airlift Control Element (TALCE), Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC),
     Passenger Service, etc.). This is especially important if there is a chance that another aircrew will
     assume the mission.
     2.1.3.12. Overseas intelligence briefing and customs procedures, if applicable.
     2.1.3.13. Diplomatic clearance information.
     2.1.3.14. Aircrew member passports, visa requirements (emphasizing expiration dates and sin-
     gle-entry verses multiple-entry visas) and international certificates of vaccinations. Immediately
     notify 18 AF TACC/XOB if aircrew member passports or visas will expire during the duration of
     the trip including up to 14 days afterwards.
     2.1.3.15. Any additional items deemed appropriate.
     2.1.3.16. Mission directives (aircraft commander should check mission information in GDSS and
     other messages pertaining to the mission when available).
     2.1.3.17. Take-off, en route, and destination weather.
  2.1.4. Crew Duty Time (CDT) and Flight Duty Period (FDP).
     2.1.4.1. Both CDT and FDP are in accordance with the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Vol-
     ume 3 series.
10                                                                    AFI11-289 16 FEBRUARY 2006


        2.1.4.2. Normally CDT and FDP begin one hour after alert. EXCEPTIONS: Any time an aircrew
        member is required to show before the standard aircrew show time, the CDT and FDP start when
        the aircrew member arrives to perform duties. For ALFA standby, CDT and FDP begin at alert.
     2.1.5. Aircrew Apparel. The aircrew uniform is the only uniform normally required on PHOENIX
     BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER missions. Civilian attire may be required at some overseas locations
     when directed by the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG).

2.2. Mission Kits. The trip kit will include, as a minimum, the following:
     2.2.1. A copy of AFI 11-289.
     2.2.2. Sufficient copies of AF IMT 15, United States Air Force Invoice.
     2.2.3. Sufficient copies of standard form SF 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher.
     2.2.4. Appropriate customs clearance forms for the aircrew and passengers.
     2.2.5. A copy of the unclassified sections of the DoD FCG for missions transiting overseas locations,
     if not already located with the Flight Information Publications.

2.3. Aircrew Command and Control (C2). Aircrews and controllers will follow C2 procedures as out-
lined in Para 4.2. For aircrews on AMC-tasked missions, “C2” refers to 18 AF TACC; for aircrews on
missions tasked by USAFE, C2 refers to FPOC; and, for PACAF- or CENTAF-tasked missions, C2 refers
to AMD. Aircrews will forward mission problems to 18 AF TACC, the FPOC or AMD, as appropriate.

2.4. Contacts. The primary POC for PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER mission planning is
WHMO Airlift Operations. The primary POC for aircrews is 18 AF TACC/XOCG, the theater FPOC or
AMD, as appropriate. The 89th Aerial Port Squadron (APS) is the single POC for aerial port issues on
PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER missions which originate or transit Andrews AFB. Nor-
mally, at all offload stations for PHOENIX BANNER missions, an Air Force Advance Agent represents
WHMO. If time permits, WHMO provides the name of its POC and Advance Agent to 18 AF TACC/
XOOO, who sends the information in the GDSS. If present, the Air Force Advance Agent will meet the
aircraft upon arrival. The aircraft commander will provide the Air Force Advance Agent with instructions
for reaching the aircrew during overnight stays (to include a telephone number); in turn, the Advance
Agent provides a telephone number to the aircraft commander where the agent can be reached. The
Advance Agent will not violate the aircraft commander’s crew rest. The aircraft commander will inform
the Advance Agent and 18 AF TACC/XOCG (or the appropriate theater FPOC or AMD) of any mainte-
nance problems, load problems, or schedule changes.

2.5. Ground Times, Early Arrivals and Departures. At onload and offload stations, the planned
ground times for PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER missions are 2+15 hours for the C-130 air-
craft, 2+45 hours for the C-17, 3+45 hours for the C-5 and 4+15 hours for the KC-10. At en route stations
without cargo onload or offload, planned ground times for these missions are 2+15 hours for the C-130,
2+15 hours for the C-17, and 3+15 hours for the C-5 and KC-10. WHMO may request shorter ground
times consistent with mission requirements and safety considerations. T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing
of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding, Para 5.32, authorizes concurrent ground operations to include
ground servicing, cargo, and maintenance. Aircrews may request early departure if all cargo and passen-
gers are loaded. With C2 concurrence, WHMO must authorize all early arrivals and departures. WHMO
AFI11-289 16 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                               11


delegates approval authority for early departures of 1+15 or less to the TACC/XOC SAAM Duty Officer.
Early departures greater than 1+15 require WHMO approval. For missions outside the continental United
States (OCONUS), diplomatic clearance validity must be considered prior to requesting or authorizing
early departures and arrivals (many diplomatic clearances do not allow early arrival).

2.6. Diplomatic Clearances. Required clearances normally will be obtained before home station depar-
ture. In some instances, this may not be possible and special assistance by the State Department may be
required. Aircraft commanders will become familiar with the provisions of Section III of the DoD FCG
and their in-flight responsibilities for all countries to be over flown or transited. Aircraft commanders
must ensure proper clearances have been received before entering foreign airspace. When in-flight devia-
tions are required due to emergencies or other contingencies, contact the appropriate C2 for assistance.
Aircraft commanders will keep the appropriate C2 informed of all actions taken or any assistance
required.

2.7. Aircraft Configuration. Configure PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, and COPPER missions accord-
ing to the GDSS. Chocks and ground wires will be on board. C-130 missions will have a cargo ramp sup-
port (milk stool) and operational cargo winch on board. 89 APS will coordinate the exact quantities of
463L equipment needed.

2.8. Passenger Requirements.
   2.8.1. In-flight Feeding.
       2.8.1.1. MAJCOM/A3 may authorize the dispensing of alcoholic beverages on PHOENIX BAN-
       NER, SILVER, or COPPER missions according to AFI 34-219, Alcoholic Beverage Program.
       2.8.1.2. Hot meals (other than in-flight frozen meals) will not normally be served unless USAF
       In-flight Passenger Service Specialists (Flight Attendants) are on board.
       2.8.1.3. WHMO Airlift Operations coordinates the number and type of meals with TRANSCOM.
       The meal request is added to the GDSS. Meals are requested for departures from USAF Active
       Duty Installations when legs are four hours or more. At stations other than USAF Active Duty
       Installations, users are responsible for in-flight meals.
           2.8.1.3.1. 89 APS will deliver meals to the aircraft for missions departing Andrews AFB.
           2.8.1.3.2. Do not over pack frozen or boxed meals. Meals Ready to Eat (MRE) may be over
           packed, if requested by the user through WHMO.
           2.8.1.3.3. IAW AFMAN 34-240, Food Service Program Management, in-flight kitchens issue
           meals on a credit basis. The senior passenger representative(s) will collect meal money from
           all passengers and will turn the money over to the aircraft loadmaster for turn-in at the next
           station's in-flight kitchen or to their home station in-flight kitchen office upon mission termi-
           nation.
       2.8.1.4. IAW AFMAN 34-240, Food Service Program Management, the in-flight kitchen will
       provide snacks, free of charge to passengers, using the Transportation Working Capital Fund
       (TWCF) for departures from USAF Active Duty Installations.
   2.8.2. Ground Requirements.
12                                                                     AFI11-289 16 FEBRUARY 2006


        2.8.2.1. At en route stops, the aircrew is not responsible for special requests of passengers unless
        directly related to the operation of the aircraft or the mission (as determined by the aircraft com-
        mander).
        2.8.2.2. Individual passengers are responsible for ensuring their baggage is on the aircraft.
     2.8.3. Aircraft Manifesting. WHMO is the manifesting authority for all PHOENIX BANNER, SIL-
     VER, and COPPER missions.
        2.8.3.1. Space Available and unrelated duty passengers are not authorized on active legs except by
        very specific exception and approval. Do not manifest, load, or airlift unrelated passengers or
        cargo unless specifically approved by the user and 18 AF TACC/XOOO (or the MAJCOM Mobil-
        ity Airlift C2 Facility), who will coordinate with WHMO. Space Available passengers are allowed
        on positioning and depositioning legs. EXCEPTION: Space Available passengers are not allowed
        on aircraft positioning from or depositioning to Marine Corps Base Quantico (KNYG).
     2.8.4. Passenger Access and Seating.
        2.8.4.1. C-5 Courier Compartment Access. WHMO will coordinate through 18 AF TACC/XOOO
        and the requirements will be published in the GDSS. Aircrews should anticipate the use of the
        Courier Compartment on all PHOENIX BANNER or PHOENIX SILVER missions. The follow-
        ing restrictions apply:
            2.8.4.1.1. Courier Compartment seating is limited to six seats. One of the six seats will be
            reserved for the HMX-1 Security Guard who will accompany all USAF aircrew members who
            require access to the cargo area when HMX-1 helicopters are carried.
            2.8.4.1.2. Normal access to areas other than Courier Compartment and lavatory requires
            approval of the aircraft commander.
        2.8.4.2. HMX-1 Passengers in the Cargo Area. During the movement of HMX-1 assets, personnel
        (including aircrew) requiring access to the cargo compartment must be accompanied by HMX-1
        security or HMX-1 maintenance personnel. EXCEPTION: During emergencies, aircrew mem-
        bers will be allowed access to the C-5 cargo compartment without escort. If a problem exists with
        a HMX-1 helicopter or with the cargo, HMX-1 security or maintenance personnel shall be granted
        access to the cargo area accompanied by an aircrew member. HMX-1 security and maintenance
        personnel will be briefed by an aircrew member on the use of emergency equipment prior to
        accompanying aircrew members during in-flight checks in the C-5 cargo compartment.
        2.8.4.3. When a military working dog is carried, the dog handler requires frequent access to the
        canine to monitor its health and welfare. If the canine is in a non-passenger area, an aircrew mem-
        ber will escort the dog handler.

2.9. Waivers. The following standing waivers are applicable to PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, and
COPPER missions only.
     2.9.1. USSS agents will retain their weapons and ammunition. They may be placed in vehicles on
     board the aircraft. HMX-1 and SENEX security will retain their weapons and ammunition when
     escorting their equipment on PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER and COPPER missions.
AFI11-289 16 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                            13


  2.9.2. Helicopters, vehicles and support equipment under direct control and escort of USSS, WHCA,
  HMX-1, SENEX and PAG may be transported without hazardous materials shipper certification,
  packing lists, load lists, placards and markings (C/B, FAW, etc).
     2.9.2.1. All helicopters, vehicles and support equipment will be prepared for air shipment accord-
     ing to AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipments. Aircrew will
     inspect the cargo to verify proper preparation for air shipment. The user will correct deficiencies
     before loading cargo.
     2.9.2.2. The standing waivers of Para 2.9. do not apply to personnel and equipment (e.g. Tanker
     Airlift Control Element, Mission Support Team, Maintenance Recovery Team) deploying to sup-
     port PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER and COPPER missions.
     2.9.2.3. Users will validate the weights and dimensions of cargo on their load plans to ensure air-
     crews have accurate data for computing the aircraft weight and balance.
  2.9.3. Escorts will brief the aircraft commander or designated representative on all hazardous material
  being transported. The aircraft commander will ensure escorts or their designee has received the nec-
  essary briefing before departure.

                                                 Chapter 3

                 AREA STANDBY FORCE AND BACKUP AIRCRAFT POLICIES

3.1. Area Standby Force.
     3.1.1. General:
        3.1.1.1. To support short-notice PHOENIX BANNER and PHOENIX SILVER missions, AMC
        maintains one C-17 aircraft and one C-17 augmented aircrew in continuous BRAVO alert at a
        CONUS location determined by 18 AF TACC/XOB. Changes to the aircrew complement or alert
        status, regardless of duration, must be approved by WHMO.
        3.1.1.2. 18 AF TACC/XOB, the MAJCOM Mobility Airlift C2 Facility, as appropriate, will task
        specific BRAVO or ALFA area standby aircraft and crews to support scheduled PHOENIX BAN-
        NER and PHOENIX SILVER missions. Authority to release the area standby resides with 18 AF
        TACC/XOZ or the MAJCOM Mobility Airlift C2 Facility, as appropriate. Coordination with the
        18 AF TACC/XOB Barrel is strongly encouraged.
        3.1.1.3. Unplanned changes to the PHOENIX BANNER and PHOENIX SILVER alert posture
        must be coordinated with WHMO. WHMO area standby requirements are in addition to other
        AMC requirements. Non-AMC controlled area standby requirements will be tasked by the MAJ-
        COM Mobility Airlift C2 Facility, as appropriate.
     3.1.2. Aircraft configuration. Chocks, ground wires, milk stool and operational winch (as applicable)
     are required for all standby aircraft.
        3.1.2.1. Standby C-130 aircraft will be configured C-1 according to AFI 11-2C-130, Volume 3,
        Addendum A, unless otherwise directed by WHMO through 18 AF TACC Combat Delivery Divi-
        sion (18 AF TACC/XOBC).
        3.1.2.2. Standby C-5 aircraft will be configured CP-2 according to AFI 11-2C-5, Volume 3,
        Addendum A, unless otherwise directed by WHMO through 18 AF TACC Airlift Allocation Divi-
        sion (18 AF TACC/XOBA).
        3.1.2.3. Standby C-17 aircraft will be configured C-2 according to AFI 11-2C-17, Volume 3,
        Addendum A, unless otherwise directed by WHMO through 18 AF TACC/XOBA.
        3.1.2.4. Standby KC-10 aircraft will be prepared with a “B” configuration IAW AFI 11-2KC-10,
        Volume 3, Para 25.5, unless otherwise directed by WHMO through 18 AF TACC/XOBA.
     3.1.3. Status. Area standby forces are normally in Bravo status. This may be upgraded to ALFA alert
     status by 18 AF TACC on a case-by-case basis after consultation with WHMO. 18 AF TACC may
     direct an additional augmented aircrew in Charlie status to facilitate area standby force reconstitution.
     Area standby aircraft in BRAVO status may be used for local training sorties so long as they remain in
     radio contact with local C2 and are capable of being on the ground at the alert location within one hour
     of being recalled. If a maintenance discrepancy is discovered that would prevent the aircraft from
     being launched on a mission, terminate the local training and have the necessary maintenance per-
     formed before accomplishing further training.
     3.1.4. Mission Validation. Validated WHMO requirements will normally be filled using home station
     launches. If there is insufficient lead time, the area standby alert force will be used with WHMO Air-
AFI11-289 16 FEBRUARY 2006                                                                              15


   lift Operations approval. The area standby force will be reconstituted IAW Para 3.1.5. WHMO will
   confirm the tasking and launch approval with 18 AF TACC/XOZ (EXCEPTION: Banner Express).
   3.1.5. Reconstitution. Area standby force reconstitution process begins when notification is received
   that the area standby force will be launched. Reconstituted area standby forces must be legal for alert
   NLT 14 hours from the time of notification. 18 AF TACC/XOB will notify WHMO through normal
   channels when the reconstituted forces will be legal for alert. Area standby forces may be used to sup-
   port other short-notice requirements with concurrence of WHMO. They will be launched from Bravo
   alert to support the new mission.
   3.1.6. Alternate Standby Force Tasking. When adverse weather conditions are forecast to impact the
   primary standby alert force, 18 AF TACC will establish an alternate standby force at a location with
   more favorable weather to ensure uninterrupted coverage. WHMO will be advised of the standby
   force alternate location and when the standby force has been reconstituted at the original location.

3.2. Backup Aircraft Policies.
   3.2.1. Backup Aircraft. All missions requiring backup IAW paragraphs 3.2.1.1., 3.2.1.2., and 3.2.1.3.
   will be backed up with like MDS, or larger aircraft, if required by the individual dimensions or
   weights of the cargo. If the load can be moved on a combination of aircraft smaller than the primary
   aircraft, the backup can be accommodated with one or more dissimilar aircraft with the approval of
   WHMO. Backup aircraft, or substitute, will be configured to support the load requirements.
       3.2.1.1. PHOENIX BANNER Backup. 18 AF TACC/XOB will establish at least one aircraft and
       aircrew in BRAVO status to cover PHOENIX BANNER active mission segments (CONUS and
       OCONUS). The aircrew complement (basic vs. augmented) will be sufficient to operate the mis-
       sion if the primary aircrew cannot. This may be upgraded to ALFA status by 18 AF TACC on a
       case-by-case basis after consultation with WHMO. The BRAVO alert aircraft and aircrew will be
       legal for alert no later than one hour prior to the scheduled departure time for active mission seg-
       ments. The MAJCOM Mobility Airlift C2 Facility will establish at least one aircraft and aircrew
       in BRAVO status when a theater-tasked PHOENIX BANNER/SILVER mission is on active mis-
       sion segments.
       3.2.1.2. PHOENIX SILVER Backup. CONUS PHOENIX SILVER missions do not normally
       require a backup aircraft. PHOENIX SILVER missions tasked to overseas locations require
       backup aircraft to include the departure from the CONUS onload locations. Backup procedures to
       OCONUS PHOENIX SILVER are the same as those for PHOENIX BANNER missions in Para
       3.2.1.1., above.
       3.2.1.3. PHOENIX COPPER Backup. PHOENIX COPPER missions do not require a backup air-
       craft unless specifically tasked by WHMO and 18 AF TACC (or theater FPOC or AMD, as appro-
       priate).
   3.2.2. Home Station Departures. No AMC-directed requirement exists for dedicated spare aircraft for
   PHOENIX BANNER/SILVER/COPPER missions departing home station. BRAVO alert or in-sys-
   tem-select aircraft will fulfill backup requirements. Unit commanders may dedicate a mission spare
   from their Wing Aircraft Allocation at their discretion.

3.3. En Route “In-System Select” Aircrew and Aircraft Requirements.
     3.3.1. For an aircrew to be considered qualified to operate a PHOENIX BANNER/SILVER/COPPER
     mission, only the aircraft commander and one loadmaster/boom operator must meet the selection and
     certification criteria in Para 2.1.1. and 2.1.2. of this regulation. In-system select aircraft may be Par-
     tially Mission Capable (PMC) as long as the selected aircraft can meet the requirements of the mission
     being operated.

                                              Chapter 4

                      SECURITY, AND COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2)

4.1. Aircraft Security. Security procedures prescribed in appropriate MAJCOM security regulations
apply to PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, and COPPER missions.
   4.1.1. For PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER missions operating into foreign airfields, 18
   AF TACC/XOO will inform HQ AMC Security Forces Division (AMC/A7F) as far in advance as
   practical. AMC/A7F will conduct the airfield security assessments, to include host nation security
   capability, and apprise HQ AMC Threat Working Group (AMC/TWG) of assessment results. If secu-
   rity vulnerabilities exist and host nation support is inadequate, or unavailable, AMC/A7F will assign
   available PHOENIX RAVEN personnel to the mission and advise both HQ AMC TWG and WHMO
   of the requirement.
   4.1.2. For PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER missions operating into foreign locations, 18
   AF TACC/XOO will inform HQ AMC Intelligence Directorate (AMC/A2) as far in advance as prac-
   tical, providing the planned flight itineraries. HQ AMC Force Protection Intelligence Analysis & Inte-
   gration Division (AMC/22) will assess the current threat of such operations, apprising HQ AMC
   TWG of results. HQ AMC Force Protection Intelligence Operations & Applications Division (AMC/
   A23) will use the planned itineraries to provide “24/7” intelligence flight following for 18 AF TACC.
   4.1.3. The aircraft commander will ensure all security force personnel tasked to support a PHOENIX
   BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER mission receive the applicable briefings.

4.2. Command and Control (C2).
   4.2.1. PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, and COPPER missions are of high level interest and must get
   special attention in accordance with established CLOSE WATCH procedures. Any problems that
   affect the mission will be immediately brought to the attention of 18 AF TACC for AMC-controlled
   assets or theater FPOC or AMD, as appropriate, for theater-controlled assets. The senior controller/
   director will take the necessary action to ensure the mission operates on schedule.
   4.2.2. Command:
      4.2.2.1. AMC tasked missions. The Commander, AMC, retains operational control of PHOENIX
      BANNER, SILVER, and COPPER aircraft and aircrews. Control is exercised through 18 AF
      TACC and the en route FPOC or AMD, as appropriate. For theater-tasked missions, the theater
      MAJCOM commander retains operational control, which is exercised through the FPOC or AMD.
      18 AF TACC, or the theater FPOC or AMD, will update all applicable MAJCOMs on the status,
      changes, or requirements. For missions when cargo transitions from 18 AF TACC to theater
      FPOC- or AMD-controlled assets, 18 AF TACC will fully coordinate all mission details with the
      appropriate FPOC or AMD to ensure precise details are passed, agreed upon, and coordinated. For
      missions when cargo transitions from the theater FPOC or AMD to 18 AF TACC, the theater
      FPOC or AMD, as appropriate, will initiate the communication for the above compliance.
      4.2.2.2. AMC tasked crews will use the 18 AF TACC C2 system to the maximum extent possible.
      Theater tasked crews will use the FPOC or AMD C2 system to the maximum extent possible. Air-
      crews will forward mission problems to 18 AF TACC/XOCG or to the theater FPOC or AMD, as
      appropriate.
18                                                                       AFI11-289 16 FEBRUARY 2006


        4.2.2.3. When AMC bases are transited, normal C2 reporting procedures apply. At non-AMC sta-
        tions, aircraft commanders will report all arrivals and departures to 18 AF TACC/XOCG by any
        means necessary, including high frequency radio, High Frequency-Automatic Link Establishment,
        L-Band Satellite Communication, commercial telephone or through Flight Service Stations.
        Non-AMC controlled units should ensure their report is received by their theater FPOC or AMD,
        as appropriate.
        4.2.2.4. When an aircraft departs during non-duty hours, the C2 agency updates the GDSS data-
        base and notifies all concerned stations.
        4.2.2.5. The appropriate C2 agency (18 AF TACC/XOCG or theater FPOC or AMD) must relay
        to WHMO Airlift Operations any mission delays and problems that will affect any active legs.
        Aircrews should not normally contact WHMO directly.
        4.2.2.6. WHMO Airlift Operations is the sole validation authority for changes to PHOENIX
        BANNER, SILVER, or COPPER missions. Air Force Advance Agents and the user (USSS,
        WHCA, and HMX-1) do not have the authority to alter scheduled missions. If the aircraft com-
        mander is approached with a proposed change, the A/C will refer the requesting party to their
        operations section or to WHMO Airlift Operations.
     4.2.3. Communications:
        4.2.3.1. Along with normal airborne reporting, remarks should include any special requirements,
        such as fuel, transportation, parking, security and in-flight meals.
        4.2.3.2. Aircrews have limited access to WHCA facilities and will use existing commercial,
        Defense Switching Network (DSN) and radio equipment for routine communications. As a last
        alternative, an aircrew requiring WHCA assistance should contact the WHCA Trip Officer or Air
        Force Advance Agent.
        4.2.3.3. For C-130 support to HMX-1 on CONUS cross-country helicopter ferry missions, contact
        the HMX-1 Operations Duty Officer for a briefing upon arrival at Marine Corps Base Quantico.
        This briefing will include primary point of contact, helicopter call sign, planned route of flight (to
        include diverts) and frequencies. The call sign and frequencies are necessary for in-flight commu-
        nication with the ferrying helicopter. Planners will ensure that the airfields are at least suitable for
        C-130 aircraft. HMX-1 Operations phone number is DSN 278-2760/2209 or Commercial (703)
        784-2760/2209.

                                               Chapter 5

                                     LOGISTICS PROCEDURES

5.1. General. This chapter provides guidelines for aircraft selection and preparation for PHOENIX
BANNER, SILVER, and COPPER missions. It applies to all maintenance personnel who support or con-
duct these support airlift missions. The most highly qualified technicians available should do all inspec-
tions, repairs, and verifications.

5.2. Aircraft Selection and Preparation. Aircraft are selected like all high priority SAAM missions to
meet the highest standards of reliability and must not have an uncorrected history of repeat or recurring
malfunctions. PMC aircraft may be used as long as the selected aircraft can meet the requirements of the
mission being flown.

5.3. Flying Crew Chiefs. Units with Flying Crew Chiefs (FCC) will assign them to PHOENIX BAN-
NER, SILVER, and COPPER missions. The FCC will be responsible for all aircraft inspections, mainte-
nance and servicing after home station departure. At en route locations, the FCC will normally coordinate,
direct, and participate in all maintenance support activities due to mission security requirements. The
FCC will be responsible to report all grounding conditions to the aircraft commander and 18 AF TACC,
or the theater FPOC or AMD, as appropriate. PHOENIX BANNER, SILVER, and COPPER aircraft
logistics recovery will be accomplished as prescribed in MAJCOM directives.

5.4. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosive (CBRNE). For PHOENIX BANNER,
SILVER, and COPPER missions operating into locations where the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction
(WMD) by terrorists is a credible threat, as determined by theater commanders, or where such weapons
have actually been used, AMC flying units will ensure their aircrew and ground crew personnel are issued
protective equipment IAW AFI 11-301, Vol 1, Aircrew Life Support (ALS) Program.

                                                 Chapter 6

                                         AIRCRAFT LOADING

6.1. Helicopter and Vehicle Loading. Secure vehicles and helicopters using 1C-XXX-9 restraint crite-
ria and this paragraph.
     6.1.1. Users will ensure that loadmasters/boom operators are aware of all additional unplanned cargo
     placed in vehicles or helicopters. This will ensure the loadmaster/boom operator can calculate the
     proper weight and balance.
     6.1.2. USSS vehicles will be driven on the C-17 and C-130 facing forward, rather than being backed
     on. Normally USSS vehicles will be driven on the C-5 through the forward doors in the drive-in mode.
     Aft doors may be used at the discretion of the loadmaster. As a minimum, use four tie-down chains on
     each end of the vehicle (total of eight). When possible for forward restraint, use at least two,
     25,000-pound tie-down chains as part of the total tie-down requirement.
        6.1.2.1. C-130 aircraft vehicle-loading ramps. 89 APS maintains vehicle-loading ramps for the
        C-130. Ramps will remain with vehicles for use on the return trip. After 89 APS vehicle loading
        ramps are properly positioned for loading or off loading, secure them to aircraft auxiliary loading
        ramps with two 5,000-pound cargo straps. Attach the ratchet end of the strap to tie-down rings of
        the sides of vehicle loading ramps and the hook end to a cross member of the aircraft auxiliary
        ramp. 89 APS will retrieve ramps on termination of the mission. This procedure should only be
        used when vehicles have no other type of approach shoring.
     6.1.3. HMX-1 Support Missions. Loadmasters will load the aircraft IAW user-provided load plans.
     Loadmasters may adjust or deviate from the load plan only when the load plan exceeds an aircraft lim-
     itation, jeopardizes safety of flight, or conflicts with command guidance.
        6.1.3.1. VH-60 helicopters are restrained by members of HMX-1 using standard tie-down pat-
        terns. For ease of on and offload, the helicopter should be loaded down the centerline of the trans-
        porting aircraft. Normally the tie-down consists of two 25,000 and six 10,000 pound chains for
        forward restraint, two 25,000 and two 10,000 pound chains for aft restraint, two 10,000 pound
        chains solely for lateral restraint and one 5,000 pound strap securing the tail wheel. The remaining
        lateral and vertical restraint requirements are normally met by the combination of all chains. Load-
        masters will not change the tie-down of helicopters to meet personal preference. The overall
        responsibility to ensure the cargo is restrained adequately still rests with the aircraft loadmaster.
     6.1.4. User cargo preparation. See section 2.9. for waivers concerning cargo preparation.
     6.1.5. User provided cargo documentation. See section 2.9. for waiver of user-provided documenta-
     tion.
     6.1.6. Users will validate the weights and dimensions of cargo on their load plans to ensure aircrews
     have accurate data for computing the aircraft weight and balance.
