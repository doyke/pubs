                                         Chapter 1

                                         GENERAL

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this operating instruction is to outline the responsibilities and
actions required for integrating the 6th Air Mobility Wing (6 AMW) and the 927th Air Refueling
Wing (927 ARW).
1.2. Authority. The provisions of Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 4000.19,
Interservice and Intragovernmental Support, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 25-201, Support
Agreements Procedures, AFI 65-601V1, Chapter 7, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Air
Mobility Command Instruction (AMCI) 36-2602, Management of the Reserve Associate
Program, and/or any other pertinent directives apply in the establishment of this instruction.
1.3. Background. Multiple MOAs were written to establish roles and responsibilities between
the 6 AMW and the 927 ARW. The MOAs provided initial guidance but failed to encompass all
agencies. Additionally, the MOAs do not provide good continuity for on-going operations. This
instruction is intended to provide legacy guidance for roles and responsibilities of the 6 AMW
and 927 ARW agencies.
1.4. Revisions. A joint review of this instruction will be conducted annually by 6 AMW/XP and
927 ARW/XP to determine if the instruction should be continued, modified, revised, or
rescinded.
MACDILLAFBI36-2602 20 JANUARY 2011                                                              5

                                 WING STAFF AGENCIES

2.1. Command and Control.
   2.1.1. Scope. This section provides guidance and documents agreement for command and
   control support of 6 AMW and 927 ARW assets. 6 AMW Command Post (CP) functions
   include emergency actions, operational reporting, recall procedures, physical security,
   Communications Security (COMSEC) procedures, mission management, training,
   certification, Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS), and Aircrew Command and
   Control Procedures training.
   2.1.2. Basis. Both 6 AMW and 927 ARW will act as a combined CP.
   2.1.3. Operational Chain of Command. CP leadership will be comprised of an active duty
   Officer in Charge (OIC) followed by a Reserve OIC, followed by an AFRC YC-02/Chief
   Master Sergeant (CMSgt) Superintendent. One active duty superintendent will comprise the
   middle management, one representing AMC and the other the AFRC assigned personnel. All
   of the aforementioned personnel will have operational command over subordinate CP
   members, but only retain MAJCOM specific administrative command over subordinate CP
   members to include, but not limited to, reporting, taskings, and disciplinary responsibilities.
   2.1.4. Responsibilities.
      2.1.4.1. Operational Reports. The Wing Commander (6 AMW/CC) will have sole
      responsibility to determine if an event or incident will be reported and will have approval
      and release authority for all operational reports (OPREP)-3 affecting 6 AMW assets. 927
      ARW/CC will have sole responsibility to determine if an event or incident will be
      reported and have approval and release authority for all OPREPs-3 affecting 927 ARW
      assets. The 6 AMW will not interfere with, alter, or delay 927 ARW reports, nor will the
      927 ARW interfere with, delay, or alter 6 AMW reports.
      2.1.4.2. Recall Procedures. The MacDill CP will use pyramid recall procedures to recall
      CP and MacDill Air Force Base (AFB) personnel. Per Air Force Reserve Command
      Instruction (AFRCI) 10-404, Unit Recall, the 6 AMW will maintain a separate recall
      checklist for telephone notification of the 927 ARW personnel.
      2.1.4.3. COMSEC. The 6 AMW and 927 ARW use identical COMSEC materials.
      Thus, both units will share COMSEC responsibilities. Primary and alternate COMSEC
      Responsible Officers (CRO) will be assigned with positions being filled by personnel
      from either unit. All CROs will be able to pick up COMSEC and drop off destruction
      documents from the MacDill AFB COMSEC Manager. Both 6 AMW and 927 ARW
      command post controllers will have knowledge and training on all COMSEC contained
      within the MacDill CP. All personnel will receive initial and annual training from the
      designated training personnel. A COMSEC binder will be updated and maintained by the
      appointed managers, and information will be kept in the same binder for continuity
      purposes. All regulations, supplements, and additional data will be kept in a binder for
      joint usage.

        2.1.4.4. Security. The MacDill CP will have a primary and alternate AMC and AFRC
        security manager. Security managers from both MAJCOMs will work together to ensure
        the security requirements for both AMC and AFRC are met. Either manager will be able
        to pull Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) reports and update user lists monthly
        including maintaining security line badges, requesting new badges, and completing a list
        for personnel who possess the badges. They will also conduct initial training and annual
        training. The positions should be filled from each unit so that any security deviations can
        be handled by the respective unit representative. A security binder will be updated and
        maintained by the appointed managers, and information will be kept in the same binder
        for continuity purposes. All regulations, supplements, and additional data will be kept in
        binders for joint usage.
        2.1.4.5. Mission Monitoring. All mission monitoring will be conducted by both 6 AMW
        and 927 ARW personnel. Flight following responsibilities will be the same for all
        controllers and all mission requirements will be met regardless of which unit a controller
        is assigned to console operations. All controllers will maintain proficiency in AFRC and
        AMC duties and become certified in all mission monitoring requirements.
        2.1.4.6. Training. The CP will have a primary and alternate AMC and AFRC training
        managers. Training managers from both MAJCOMs will work together to ensure the
        training requirements for both AMC and AFRC are met. The CP will have a primary and
        alternate Command and Control Procedures Training Manager. These training managers
        will be responsible for teaching aircrew command and control procedures to all assigned
        6 AMW and 927 ARW assigned aircrew personnel. All CP personnel will be trained
        using the same training plan. Training will be accomplished with monthly training
        sessions to be held on ARFC Unit Training Assemblies (UTA) weekends to
        accommodate AFRC personnel and then again during normal duty week periods to
        accommodate AMC personnel. Each controller will be certified by both respective wing
        commanders.
        2.1.4.7. SORTS. Each unit will be responsible to maintain their own SORTS program to
        include reporting, training, and Staff Assistance Visits (SAV).
        2.1.4.8. Emergency Actions. The MacDill CP has a United States Strategic Command
        (USSTRATCOM) Operation Plan 8010-08, Global Deterrence and Strike (OPLAN
        8010) support commitment. All assigned personnel must be certified in USSTRATCOM
        and AMC Emergency Actions procedures. Training managers will create monthly closed
        book exams that will be administered to all assigned personnel. A joint Master Task
        Listing (MTL) and Annual Training Plan (ATP) will be completed and maintained on
        file. The joint MTL and ATP will provide an outline that encompasses all necessary
        requirements for the 6 AMW and 927 ARW command post personnel. Both units have
        like missions at this time and the MAJCOM requirements are identical. However, there
        are some AFRC specific tasks that must be delineated in the training plan.
2.2. Safety.
     2.2.1. Scope. This section provides guidance and documents agreement for Wing Safety
     operations of 6 AMW and 927 ARW assets.

          time.
          6.2.3.2.5. Boxes used for 45 AES bags will be provided by 45 AES/SGL from the
          operational in-flight kits.
       6.2.3.3. Operational Support.       The 6 MDG/SGSP personnel perform monthly
       disinterested inventories and biannual inventory and monitor 45 AES narcotics for
       expiration dates. Items may be rotated with 6 MDG stock to prevent expiration.
       Maintenance of narcotics will be done according to 6 MDG/SGSP local guidance (6
       MDG Instruction 41-22, Monthly-Disinterested Inventories: Narcotics and Controlled
       Drugs, Pharmacy OI-51, Pharmacy Flight Controlled Drugs). 6 MDG/SGSP will provide
       copies of monthly and biannual inventories, AF Forms 579, inventory adjustments, and
       records of destruction to 45 AES/SGL. 6 MDG/SGSP will provide current telephone
       contact information that is needed to access narcotics in the event they are needed with a
       two-hour notice. 45 AES/ CN will annually provide 6 MDG/SGSP an authorization letter
       listing nurses allowed access to narcotics for missions.
       6.2.3.4. Mission Support. The 45 AES/DOO anticipates need for operational narcotics
       based on known mission requirements and informs 6 MDG/SGSP as soon as possible. If
       narcotics are required unexpectedly after duty hours, 6 MDG/SGSP personnel are
       contacted utilizing current contact information. A two-hour time is expected, allowing
       for time to contact pharmacy personnel and obtain narcotics. Narcotics will be signed out
       on the day they are required. An authorized 45 AES nurse will present a military
       identification (ID) card and either a flight authorization identifying the mission, or a letter
       from the 45 AES/CN or 45 AES/CC showing the narcotics requirement. The 6
       MDG/SGSP personnel will verify authorization to obtain narcotics by comparing ID card
       with annual authorization letter listing nurses allowed access to narcotics. 45 AES nurse
       and 6 MDG/SGSP personnel will count narcotics and record information on AF Form
       579. The 45 AES nurse will follow local 6 MDG guidance (Pharmacy 01-51) to sign out
       the narcotics. Narcotics are returned to 6 MDG/SGSP pharmacy immediately after return
       from a mission and are not stored in 45 AES facilities. The 45 AES/DOO will coordinate
       return of narcotics with 6 MDG/SGSP prior to aircraft arrival. The 45 AES nurse and 6
       MDG/SGSP will count narcotics and record information on AF Form 579.
       6.2.3.5. Manpower. The 6 MDG/SGSP will have personnel available at all times to
       support short notice 45 AES missions requiring use of operational narcotics. The 6
