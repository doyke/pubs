doors. This includes both electrically and manually operated doors, and applies regardless of
whether or not the facility is still utilized to house aircraft. Any hangar, hush house, or PAS
modified in a manner that physically prevents the doors from being operated (open and closed)
are not required to be in compliance with this operating instruction as these modified doors can
no longer create hazards associated with hangar doors. The configuration of any modified
facility will be inspected by 86 Airlift Wing (AW) safety office to assist in determining
applicability of this operating instruction. After the inspection, the appropriate safety office will
draft a memorandum for record (MFR) to reflect the details of the assessment and facility
configuration (to include specific modifications that prevent the doors from being operated.)
Include a statement requiring the unit to contact 86 AW safety office in the event the facility is
further modified in a manner that allows the doors to operate. In this case, the facility will be
required to be in full compliance with this standard.
2. GENERAL POLICY. Hangar door operations are inherently dangerous, and have caused
numerous Air Force crushing injuries and deaths. Personnel operating powered or manual doors
must be extremely vigilant to protect themselves and others. Body positioning is extremely
important, as all hangar doors have crush points. Never allow anyone to position their body,
head, hands or feet in an area that can put them at risk. Strict adherence to operating instructions
is essential to prevent injuries.
     2.1. Door operators must be formally trained on shelter/hangar door operations using the
     procedures outlined in this instruction.
     2.2. Hangar and shelter doors, as well as door operating mechanisms, must be maintained in
     good working condition in order to mitigate the inherent hazards to the greatest extent
     possible.
     2.3. Door operating checklist and post checklist (in both English and host nation) will be
     coordinated through the 86 AW safety office and the checklists will be posted at each hangar
     door control panel.
3. MARKINGS FOR POWERED HANGAR DOORS.
     3.1. All powered hangar doors will be marked in accordance with (IAW) AFOSH 91-100
     USAFE Supp 1 paragraph 7.2.3.
     3.2. Attachments 2a through 2d will be used to standardize required markings for different
     facility categories.
4. INSPECTION AND TESTING.
     4.1. Squadron commanders will appoint in writing facility mangers to 786 Civil Engineer
     Squadron (CES) Customer Service.
     4.2. Document inspections of electrically operated doors monthly and manually operated
     doors quarterly on an AF Form 2411, Inspection Form, and post it along with the door
     operating checklist and post checklist, adjacent to the door controls.
     4.3. Inspect all warning and safety markings of powered hangar doors monthly, and either
     repair (if within their capability) or initiate a work order through 786 Civil Engineer (CE)
     Service Call to have the deficiency remedied. Coordinate the work order through the 86 AW
     safety office to determine if a Risk Assessment Code (RAC) is necessary.

     4.3.1. If necessary, door wheel locks can be disengaged and the door pushed open
     manually with proper supervisory oversight until door is repaired.
     4.3.2. Contact 786 CES Customer Service or 86 AW safety office if unsure about any
     inspection or marking requirements. Submit work orders immediately to correct any
     deficiencies noted.
  4.4. In conjunction with the wing annual ground safety inspection, the 86 AW safety office
  will conduct an annual hangar door safety program inspection for any organization this
  operating instruction applies to.
5. TRAINING.
  5.1. Personnel will be fully trained within their duty section on safety considerations,
  mechanical condition inspection and proper door operating procedures before being
  authorized to operate any hangar or aircraft shelter doors.
  5.2. Supervisors will ensure that their personnel have been properly trained on door
  operating procedures by squadron’s on the job training (OJT) program.
  5.3. Squadron commander or designated representative will approve all hangar door
  operators prior to being authorized to operate hangar doors.
  5.4. All lessons plans must be reviewed and coordinated through the 86 AW safety office
  before being used to certify hazard familiarity or door operation.
  5.5. All personnel who routinely work in areas with hangar doors but do not operate hangar
  doors will receive general hangar door hazard training prior to being exposed to associated
  hazards. This training will be performed as part of the work center’s job safety training
  program and documented IAW paragraph 6.1 of this instruction. Use Attachment 4 as a
  briefing guide.
  5.6. Personnel who regularly work in areas with hangar doors and are required to operate the
  hangar doors will be trained IAW paragraph 5.5 of this instruction and additionally be trained
  in the inspection, testing and operation of applicable hangar doors within their work centers.
  This additional training will be documented IAW paragraph 6.2 of this instruction. Units
  will tailor the sample lesson plan in Attachment 5 to their specific facility.
6. DOCUMENTATION:
  6.1. All personnel exposed to the hazards posed by hangar doors will receive general hangar
  door hazard training as part of their work center specific safety training. Supervisors will
  document this as part of their work center safety training contained in the Job Safety Training
  Outline (JSTO). Training must address the hazards and precautions required when in
  proximity of hangar doors. Document completion of work center safety training on the
  member’s AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record. Contractors will document
  training on contractor specific training records.
  6.2. Initial door operation training will be documented in a Maintenance Information System
  (MIS) and tracked on a special certification roster (SCR) for maintenance personnel. For non
  maintenance personnel training will be documented on AF Form 797. Contractors will
  document training on contractor specific training records. There are separate course codes
  loaded for each of the four general categories of facilities as follows:
