1. Compliance. The 374 AW FOD/DOP Prevention Program is defined by a combination of
published guidance. Compliance with the applicable portions of 374 MXG OI 21-124, Tool and
Equipment Management and Control, and the FOD/DOP section of AFI 21-101_AMCSUP
chapter 14, constitute compliance with the 374 AW FOD/DOP Prevention Program.
2. Prevention Policy. FOD and dropped objects are costly and have a negative impact on
mission accomplishment. Every effort will be made by all 374 AW personnel to ensure FOD
and DOP prevention measures are followed. Supervisors at all levels will ensure everyone
within their span of control is trained on, and implements FOD/DOP prevention procedures at all
times.
3. General Procedures:
     3.1. “FOD Elimination” is the standard. Attention to detail, coupled with a proactive
     approach at all levels, will result in a zero FOD rate. FOD prevention is everyone's
     responsibility. Supervisors at every level will ensure that proper FOD prevention procedures
     are strictly enforced.
        3.1.1. “ZERO TOLERANCE” is the standard for all FOD prevention measures as well
        as for 374th Maintenance Group Quality Assurance (374 MXG/MXQ) assessments on
        aircraft, work areas directly in or around aircraft, tool boxes, work areas that support
        aircraft systems and Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE).
        3.1.2. All FOD assessments and spot checks will be objective based on the “zero
        tolerance” concept.
        3.1.3. FOD found within one half hour of a FOD walk or hangar sweep will constitute a
        fail against the performing organization. FOD found, including FO discovered later than
        one half hour after a FOD walk or hangar sweep, will be subject to investigation by 374
        AW FOD Monitor or QA inspectors.
        3.1.4. The “clean-as-you-go” concept will be strictly followed. On the flight line and in
        the hangars, it is important to stress that proactive housekeeping procedures will be
374AWI21-101 22 MAY 2012                                                                       3


      initiated throughout every task. The task is not complete until the area is cleaned up.
      Strict use of parts bags will be enforced.
          3.1.4.1. Incorporate “clean as you go” into FOD training to enhance the ability of
          reducing potential FOD.
          3.1.4.2. “Clean as you go” procedures are expressed below:
      Clean the immediate area when work cannot continue.
      Clean the immediate area when work debris has the potential to migrate to an out of sight
      or inaccessible area and cause damage and/or give the appearance of poor workmanship.
      Clean the immediate area after work is completed and prior to inspection.
      Clean area at the end of each shift.
      If you drop something or hear something drop--pick it up!
4. FOD Prevention.
   4.1. FOD prevention is the responsibility of all personnel working in, on, around or traveling
   through the airfield and areas near aircraft, munitions, AGE, engines or components.
   Personnel working in or transiting the aforementioned areas will comply with this
   instruction.
      4.1.1. Practice good housekeeping and hardware accountability at all times. Parts bags
      will be used at all times and will be attached to the associated component or area as
      applicable.    Use attached tag to indicate types and totals of items inside,
      aircraft/equipment number and safely secure parts. Plastic “Ziploc” type bags may be
      used as parts bags, provided they have a listing included on paper or have the contents
      annotated on the package with permanent ink. Locally produced part accountability kits
      may also be used to account for component hardware (e.g., engine mount bolt kit).
      4.1.2. Hardware and shop stock control. Hardware and shop stock (acid brushes, paint
      pens, razor blades, etc.) will be issued on a one-for-one basis. Bench stock must be
      secured in a controlled area. When obtaining these items from the Consolidated Tool Kit
      (CTK) or Supply area, turn in one item to receive one like item. For instances where a
      turn-in part is not available, CTK or supply personnel will annotate a locally produced
      log with the following minimum information: Name, rank, bin number, quantity, date,
      aircraft tail number, and job control number. Contracted maintenance operations will
      follow these guidelines, except in areas where their statement of work exempts them from
      it due to contractual FOD prevention requirements.
   4.2. While maintenance is being performed on aircraft, components, uninstalled engines, and
   AGE properly cover openings, plug or cap ports, lines, hoses, electrical connections, pitot
   tubes, and ducts to prevent FOs from entering these systems. Ensure plugs fit snugly and
   properly and that securing hardware is serviceable. Test equipment and equipment in parts
   lockers will have receptacles capped and cable ends protected with a cap or bag when not in
   use.
      4.2.1. Streamers. “REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT” streamers will be used on ground
      wires and any external cover applied to the aircraft on the ground.
4                                                                   374AWI21-101 22 MAY 2012


    4.3. Clothing restrictions. Hats will not be worn on the flight line or in engine test cell areas.
    All personnel performing ground observer duties for engine start to include engine test cell
    personnel must clear pockets of foreign objects (pens, pencils, etc.) prior to engine operation.
       4.3.1. Wear of the winter watch cap is authorized and may be worn during aircraft
       launch or recovery when using the following procedures:
       4.3.2. Ear defender/communication headset devices should be worn over the watch cap.
       4.3.3. If ear defender/communication headset is not worn over watch cap then cap must
       be firmly set on individual’s head and pulled down over ears to prevent it from
       inadvertently coming off.
       4.3.4. For FOD prevention and safety reasons the AF Form 1199, Air Force Entry
       Control Card, will be removed from the outer garment during engine inlet maintenance
       and secured on their person. Badge will be secured to the member by use of a plastic
       armband or quick release nylon/cotton cord. A metal clip may be used for securing the
       badge and cord by passing the cord through the hole to prevent loss. The badge will be
       replaced on the outer garment upon termination or when not in the immediate area where
       the engine inlet maintenance is conducted.
    4.4. Flight deck FOD inspections. All 374 AW aircraft flight deck FOD prevention
    inspections will be accomplished no earlier than 4 hours prior to flight and annotated in the
    aircraft AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. Check for
    foreign, loose, or missing items (light lenses, covers, bulbs, and hardware) on all instrument,
    control, and circuit breaker panels. Pay particular attention to areas around seat tracks, flight
    control inputs, and openings in the throttle quadrant and floor.
       4.4.1. All 374 AW C-130 aircraft throttle quadrant covers will be installed immediately
       after each flight and will remain installed while the aircraft is on the ground to include
       sealed spare and training aircraft. When removed to accomplish an engine run or
       maintenance in the throttle quadrant area, covers will be re-installed immediately after
       maintenance.
    4.5. All aircraft hangars, maintenance production areas, and vehicles that frequent flight
    line/maintenance areas will have approved area FOD containers readily accessible to
    workers. An area FOD container will be a sturdy receptacle. Flight line vehicle containers
    must be lidded type containers. Shops may fabricate or procure small portable FO containers
    (coffee cans, FOD bags, etc.) for use where area collection points are not feasible such as on
    maintenance stands or work benches.
       4.5.1. Containers will be stenciled with the word “FOD” in contrasting letters. “FOD”
       stickers may be used on FOD containers and are available from the 374 AW FOD
       Monitor’s office.
       4.5.2. All FOD containers will be emptied when full or at the end of each shift,
       whichever comes first.
    4.6. Base FOD walks. FOD walks are mandatory to remove FO from the flight line parking
    ramp, access road, and adjacent areas.
       4.6.1. 374 AW level FOD walks are conducted once a week at a time dependent on
       mission requirements to maximize participation (usually Tuesday prior to 1200 hours).
374AWI21-101 22 MAY 2012                                                                         5


       Squadron personnel will assemble at designated flight line area spots.              Maximum
       participation is essential for a successful FOD walk.
       4.6.2. FOD walk areas of responsibility are as follows:

Table 1. Responsibility of FOD Walk Areas
             SQUADRON                              AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY

                                          Spot C-8
730 AMS (FOD Walk on Wednesday)           Aircraft Parking Spots C-8 to Aircraft Parking
                                          Spot C5-4
       4.6.3. The Wing FOD Monitor may adjust FOD walk days to meet mission requirements
       when necessary. FOD walks may be terminated by the Wing FOD Monitor during
       inclement weather (e.g., heavy fog, heavy rain, severe temperatures, or when the
       Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) announces lightning inside five nautical miles).
       FOD walks will be rescheduled accordingly if cancelled.
       4.6.4. Aircraft maintenance units (AMUs) should conduct their own FOD walks on each
       duty day when group-level FOD walks are not accomplished. Individuals will conduct
       walks around individual aircraft and hangars prior to start and after completion of any
       maintenance on that aircraft. The alternative procedure is for units to assemble a
       structured line once a day in their area and conduct a FOD walk.
       4.6.5. FOD walk procedures. All participants will assemble prior to FOD walk for a
       safety briefing. For safety reasons the FOD walk supervisor has ultimate authority in
       controlling procession of the line and personnel will disperse evenly as directed.
       Movement will be at a slow pace, paying special attention to equipment, grounding
       points, expansion joints, and cracks in pavement. Personnel will disperse evenly as
       directed and move slowly in an even line. If hardware (safety wire, rivets, nuts, washers,
       etc.) is discovered, inform the FOD walk supervisor of the parking spot where the item
       was found.
       4.6.6. Aircraft parking spots will be FOD walked prior to parking and after moving
       aircraft from the spot. This requirement pertains to both towed and taxied aircraft. Tow
       supervisors/expediters will ensure the spot is FOD walked no sooner than 30 minutes
       prior to parking on and no later than 30 minutes after moving from the spot.
   4.7. Towed FOD sweepers and airfield sweeper vehicles will be used for base FOD
   prevention efforts.
 6                                                               374AWI21-101 22 MAY 2012


        4.7.1. Areas requiring airfield sweepers will be coordinated through the airfield manager
        by calling the Maintenance Operations Center.
        4.7.2. Towed FOD Sweeper Usage. The FOD sweeper is an effective tool used to
        supplement airfield sweepers in removing FOD from large areas of the airfield in an
        efficient manner. In order for the FOD sweeper to be effective, units that are assigned a
        FOD sweeper must tow it on a regularly scheduled basis. The squadron FOD monitors
        are responsible for managing this program at the squadron level.
        4.7.3. One triplex FOD sweeper is assigned to 374 MXS and one triplex FOD sweeper is
        assigned to 374 AMXS.
        4.7.4. Any vehicle can be used to pull the FOD sweeper so long as good coverage of the
        ramp is achieved. To prevent damage to the FOD sweeper backing of the vehicle is
        prohibited with the FOD sweeper installed, and the FOD sweeper should not be towed
        during inclement weather. Vehicles towing a FOD sweeper should focus additional
        attention on parking spots recently vacated by aircraft.
        4.7.5. FOD sweeper usage will be tracked and recorded by the CTK of the assigned
        workcenter on AF Form 3131, General Purpose Form. The form will track the
        following: Name of personnel, squadron/office symbol, date/time, hours driven, area
        covered, weight of material collected.
        4.7.6. Units will decide which shift and how many hours the FOD sweeper will be towed
        based on mission requirements and ramp/taxiway condition. After days of inclement
        weather it is recommended that the FOD sweeper be pulled to ensure a FOD free ramp.
           4.7.6.1. The unit FOD representative or CTK will notify the 374 AW FOD
           prevention office when a sweeper goes down for maintenance. Sweepers will be
           borrowed from another unit to sweep required areas, which will be credited to the unit
           pulling it.
           4.7.6.2. FOD sweeper usage requirements are as follows:

Table 2. Requirements of FOD Sweeper Usage
SQUADRON ASSIGNED                   AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY
374 AMXS                            Parking spot D-11 to parking spot C-8
374 MXS                             Wash rack to parking spot D-11

     4.8. Incentive Program. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Poster Competition/Golden Bolt
     Award.
        4.8.1. The 374 AW has established the Quarterly FOD Poster Competition. This
        competition is open to the entire 374 AW and its tenant units. Posters may be drawn by
        hand or developed electronically. Submit completed posters to the 374 AW FOD
        Monitor either electronically or in person before the last day of each calendar quarter.
           4.8.1.1. The Unit FOD Committee will vote for the best poster. For quarterly
           competitions, the winner will receive a certificate and be authorized/recommended
374AWI21-101 22 MAY 2012                                                                      7


         for a 1-day pass. The annual competition winner will receive a certificate and be
         authorized/recommended for a 3-day pass.
     4.8.2. Each month the Wing FOD Monitor will hide a Golden Bolt in a maintenance
     work area or on the airfield during the weekly FOD walks. Whoever finds the bolt will
     be recommended for a 1-day pass and receive a certificate from the 374 AW Vice
     Commander (374 AW/CV). These passes must be coordinated with the individual’s
     work center supervisor and be taken when workload permits. The bolt will be clearly
     tracked by the FOD Monitor to preclude its loss during FOD walk.
  4.9. Airfield inspection and monitoring.
     4.9.1. Representatives from 374 OSS Airfield Operations (374 OSS/OSAM) and the
     FOD monitor will conduct random ramp inspections. The FOD monitor will forward any
     findings from these inspections of damaged pavement, flight line construction, and other
     FOD hazards in or near aircraft parking ramps, taxiways, and access roads to 374
     OSS/OSAM for tracking purposes.
     4.9.2. Results of these inspections will be tracked in the Quality Assurance database or a
     locally devised form and briefed quarterly to the 374 AW/CV at the Wing FOD
     Prevention committee meeting.
  4.10. Engine/propeller maintenance. Aircraft engine/propeller maintenance is a FO/FOD
  critical area. All personnel will exercise caution when performing maintenance in these
  areas. Strict tool and hardware control practices will be enforced during engine/propeller
  maintenance. All hardware will be accounted for at all times.
     4.10.1. Covers (e.g., engine inlet, pitot tube(s), and protective covers) will not be
     removed more than 4 hours prior to flight and will be installed within 30 minutes
     following engine shutdown. Engine inlet covers will be installed for any maintenance
     accomplished on the engine/propeller forward of the engine firewall. All covers will be
     inspected after any severe weather condition to ensure serviceability and inventory.
     4.10.2. All engine inlet maintenance, to include inlet/exhaust inspections prior to/after
     each engine operation and blade blending, will be annotated on a Red X symbol in the
     AFTO Form 781A. Inlet/exhaust inspections before and after operation or maintenance
     will be conducted by a qualified 7-level or red-X qualified 5-level as identified on the
     unit’s Special Certification Roster (SCR) for that task.
     4.10.3. Blade damage. Upon discovery of blade damage, annotate AFTO Form 781A on
     a red dash and notify the MOC and 374 AW FOD Office prior to any rework of blades.
         4.10.3.1. A propulsion 7-Level (2A671B) will determine if damage is repairable/non-
         repairable by conducting a thorough visual inspection of the engine inlet, 5th and 10th
         stage bleed air port, and turbine exhaust areas. Air Force or field-level engineering
         experts may also be contacted to assist in determining repair limitations.
         4.10.3.2. When damage has been previously blended with no rework required, the
         applicable areas will be recoated with blue layout dye and annotated in the AFTO
         Form 781A.
         4.10.3.3. When blending is required the damage will be measured using a borescope.
         At this time, upgrade the original discrepancy to a Red-X symbol.

           4.10.3.4. Only qualified personnel that have attended a formal blade-blending course
           conducted by a qualified blade blending instructor will perform blade blending. This
           qualification will be documented on the unit’s SCR.
           4.10.3.5. An all systems Red X certified or an Field Training Detachment (FTD)
           trained and certified propulsion 7-level, as documented on the unit SCR, will inspect
           the blending and clear the Red-X discrepancy from the aircraft forms.
           4.10.3.6. Blade blending (installed engines). Notify Wing FOD Monitor (730
           AMS/QA FOD Monitor for AMC aircraft) prior to any blade blending on installed
           engines. Complete a Blade blending worksheet (Attachment 2) and forward by fax or
           e-mail to applicable 374 AW FOD monitor and the engine management branch
           (EMB). EMB will document this data in the AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical
           Data, IAW TO 00-20-1-WA-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
           Documentation, Policy and Procedures.
           4.10.3.7. Blade blending (uninstalled engines). Notify Wing FOD monitor of any

           work package tracking sheet and forward by fax or e-mail to applicable 374 AW FOD
           monitor and the engine management branch (EMB). EMB will document this data in
           the AFTO Form 9, IAW TO 00-20-1-WA-1 upon review of the work package.
           4.10.3.8. Non-repairable blade damage. When damage is verified by the previously
           mentioned methods and is confirmed as non-repairable, notify the applicable unit
           supervision and initiate impoundment procedures IAW AFI 21-101_AMCSUP and
           applicable operating instructions. Also, ensure the MOC and 374 AW FOD monitor
           are updated with this information.
    4.11. Vehicles. Vehicles are potential FO/FOD hazards. All vehicles will be maintained
    FO-free at all times. Vehicles and FOD bars will be checked for cleanliness prior to
    initialing the AF Form 1800, Operator's Inspection Guide and Trouble Report (General
    Purpose Vehicles). Each subsequent operator will ensure the vehicle and magnetic bar are
    FO free. All vehicle/equipment tires and magnetic bars will be checked and cleared of debris
    prior to entering the flight line. During hours of darkness, a bright flashlight will be used for
    this inspection. Vehicles involved in an actual emergency response are exempt from these
    tire checks.
       4.11.1. All vehicles prior to entering a flightline gate (with the exception of the control
       tower gate, and the dental gate) will come to a complete stop, turn off the engine and set
       parking brake. Control tower and dental gate FOD checks will be completed after the
       flightline gate. Passengers will exit the vehicle and check for imbedded foreign objects
       on vehicle tire surfaces, then pull forward (roll-over) and check any previously
       unexposed tire surface area for imbedded foreign objects. Vehicle operators will also
       check for any loose objects or unsecure cargo on the vehicle. This check will be
       accomplished inside or as close to the “FOD Roll-Over Tire Check Box” as possible, and
       will be accomplished prior to the FOD check sign.
       4.11.2. Magnetic FOD bars may be installed on all “high use” Transit
       Alert/dispatch/expediter vehicles. Vehicles exempt from this requirement are as follows:
374AWI21-101 22 MAY 2012                                                                        9


      Crash/recovery vehicles, mules/golf carts, tow vehicles, Grove crane, forklifts, other
      special purpose vehicles, and any vehicles not operated frequently on the flight line.
      4.11.3. If used, FOD bars will be installed either on the front or back bumper of the
      vehicle approximately 3”- 5” off the ground. All FOD bars will be removed prior to turn
      in to vehicle maintenance and reinstalled immediately upon return.
   4.12. Approved FOD containers will be installed on all multi or special purpose vehicles
   (metros, deicers, tow vehicles, etc.) which frequent flight line/maintenance areas. Due to
   safety concerns, Grove cranes and forklifts are exempt from this policy.
   4.13. Tool Management. All personnel working in, on, around, or traveling through areas
   near aircraft, munitions, AGE, engines or components, will account for all tools and/or
   equipment used in performance of their duties. Comply with all requirements in AFI 21-
   101_AMCSUP.
   4.14. Cell phones, pagers, etc. used on the flight line or in maintenance work areas will only
   be used for official/authorized business. Cell phones will not be used while actively
   performing maintenance. During maintenance actions, cell phones and other electronic
   devices (e.g., PDAs, pagers) not required in the performance of maintenance, shall be turned
   off. Placing cell phones or other electronic devices in the silent or vibrate mode does not
   satisfy this requirement. This restriction does not apply to personnel performing
   maintenance management duties (e.g., Pro Super, Expediter). Care/prudence should be
   exercised when using electronic devices on the flightline so as not to create a FOD hazard.
      4.14.1. Government equipment issued for the performance of official duties on the flight
      line must be appropriately marked/identified with squadron and office symbol, (i.e., 374
      MXG/MXQ). Personnel will also comply with restrictions in T.O. 00-25-172, AFMAN
      91-201, AFI 91-207, AFI 31-218 and AFI 21-101.
5. Dropped Object Prevention (DOP).
   5.1. DOP is the responsibility of all aircraft operators and maintainers. Prevention begins
   when aircraft panels are removed, access doors opened, or when maintenance is performed
   on an exterior component.
   5.2. General. When installing/operating aircraft panels, doors, and components, place
   special emphasis on the condition of latches, fasteners, hinge pins, and hinge lobes. Preflight
   inspections must ensure panels, doors, and components fit properly and are attached securely.
6. Reporting and Investigations.
   6.1. FOD/DOP reporting and investigations will be accomplished IAW AFI 91-204, Safety
   Investigations and Reports, and AFI 21-101_AMCSUP as applicable. Informational copies
