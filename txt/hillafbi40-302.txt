1. Responsibility: Active Duty military, retired military, DoD employees, and other base-
affiliated members are responsible for the welfare of families and for the conduct of their
dependents and guests while on the military installation in base housing.
2. Procedures: The following identifies the requirements for the supervision of children based
on the child’s age. Parents should use good judgment to determine whether other restrictions are
necessary based on your child’s mental and physical maturity. This policy cannot cover every
situation. Adherence to this instruction is meant to ensure the safety of the children. Failure to
follow this policy may result in intervention by base authorities and agencies.
     2.1. Upon notification of an allegation that a child (children) has been left unsupervised, it is
     each individual’s responsibility, active duty and/or civilian, to report the information to the
     75th Security Forces Squadron by calling 911.
     2.2. 75th Security Forces Squadron (75 SFS). 75 SFS will immediately dispatch a unit to
     investigate allegations of lack of supervision.
     2.3. Depending upon level of severity and safety, SFS will contact Department of Children
     and Family Services (DCFS) and/or the sponsor’s Command. DCFS and Command can
     respond to home immediately to address safety concerns.
     2.4. 75th Medical Operations Squadron Family Advocacy Program (75 MDOS/SGOWF)
     will receive referral. Upon receipt of an allegation of lack of supervision, the FAO will
     respond in accordance with (IAW) Hill AFB Instruction to AFI 40-301, Family Advocacy
     Program (FAP), and USAF Family Advocacy Program Standards.
     2.5. FAP: Is designated to assist agencies in assessing lack of supervision for children on
     Hill AFB to include child endangerment and neglect.
     2.6. It is expected that each individual and agency will communicate, cooperate, and
     coordinate with other individuals/agencies to ensure the safety and welfare of the child
     (children).
3. Age-Specific Guidance:
     3.1. 0-5 Years Old: Parent/caretaker can hear child at all times and see child frequently.
        3.1.1. 6-9 Years Old: Parent/caretaker is easily accessible at all times and knows the
        child’s location. Leaving a child under the age of 9 or under alone in a car at any time is
        against Utah State Law and is considered a misdemeanor.
        3.1.2. 10 Years or Older: Child may be left alone if there are no emotional or physical
        limitations and if the child is comfortable with the situation. The length of time the child
        is left alone depends on the child’s capabilities and maturity.
        3.1.3. Parents, guardians, and/or designated caretakers of children are expected to
        carefully consider several important variables before determining that their child(ren) can
        safely be left without direct adult supervision for any period of time. These factors
        include:
HILLAFBI 40-302 3 JULY 2014                                                                       3


   3.2. Maturity of child
       3.2.1. Duration and frequency of times without direct supervision.
       3.2.2. Childs knowledge of emergency procedures
       3.2.3. Accessibility to parent or another specific informed adult.
       3.2.4. Presence of physically/emotionally handicapping conditions.
       3.2.5. Time of the day or night.
       3.2.6. Other children present or to be supervised.
   3.3. A responsible caretaker must be physically and mentally capable of providing the
   necessary supervision of the child/children under his/her care.
   3.4. Unattended children who exhibit destructive behavior such as vandalism or stealing
   should be reported to 75th SFS.
4. Babysitter guidelines:
   4.1. Individuals under 18 years of age who care for younger children are strongly
   encouraged to participate in a certified babysitter’s course. Since there are varying degrees of
   maturity in children, parents will ensure that older children who babysit have enough
   experience to care properly for younger children. They must be able to control the children in
   their care, understand actions to be taken, and take proper action for situations that may arise.
   All children and/or babysitters should have the telephone numbers to notify police, fire, and
   rescue personnel, parent or responsible adult in the event of an emergency.
   4.2. Babysitter guidelines for siblings:
       4.2.1. 12–13 Years Old: Generally able to babysit for family members who are at least
       4 years old. It is highly recommended they have successfully completed an approved
       babysitting course.
       4.2.2. 14 Years Old and Over: Generally able to babysit infants, toddlers, and older
       children. It is highly recommended they have successfully completed an approved
       babysitting course.
       4.2.3. 15 Years Old and Older: Can be left alone overnight with access to adult
       supervision; sponsor must be in the local area.
       4.2.4. Babysitting courses are offered by the Red Cross. To get more information contact
       the on base Youth Center at (801) 777-2419.
   4.3. Failure to adhere to these guidelines will result in 75 SFS reports being forwarded to the
   member’s unit for action and the 75 MDOS/SGOWF for assessment of child neglect.

    4.4. PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES: Supervising children is one of the most important
    responsibilities parents have. The ultimate responsibility for the safety, care, well being, and
    behavior of dependent children remains with the parent, whether they are personally present
    to supervise them or not.

                                        YOUTH SUPERVISION POLICY

A2.1. NOTE: The ages specified are the maximum ages and are based on the child’s ability to
demonstrate age-appropriate behavior. Children who do not consistently demonstrate age-
appropriate behavior should not be given the same degree of self-management responsibilities.
These guidelines are mandated by Hill AFB, therefore, parents are expected to fully comply.
