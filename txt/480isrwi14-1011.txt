                            MISSION AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Mission. The 480 ISR WG’s mission, as the lead wing for Air Force Distributed Common
Ground System (AFDCGS), involves the exploitation of imagery from global distributed and
reach back ISR systems. This operationally requires the 480 ISR WG to exploit imagery from
multiple data sources, produce a variety of intelligence products, and support war-fighters in
various theaters. The responsibility placed on 480 ISR WG exploitation units for general and
time-sensitive exploitation of national and airborne imagery requires it to maintain assets in
accordance with Air Force and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) standards.
   1.1.1. As part of its mission, the Wing is required to maintain the quality of both film and
   digital-based imagery utilized across the Wing’s exploitation facilities. This involves
   ensuring end-to-end Image Quality (IQ) throughout the image chain supporting 480 ISR WG
   DCGS and non-ISR mission requirements to provide consistency across the Wing’s
   intelligence operations. In order to ensure image quality performance through an ISR
   imaging enterprise, it must be addressed across the end-to-end collection, distribution, and
   exploitation architecture from sensor to end-user. To achieve this objective, the USAF must
   incorporate IQ initiatives into the design, build, and operational life cycle of the end-to-end
   enterprise. This is achieved be threading IQ initiatives across the enterprise and stakeholder
   organizations. The purpose of this operating instruction is to establish formalized IQ
   initiatives within the 480 ISR WG, to maintain local site architectures, in addition to
   supporting efforts across external stakeholder organizations to ensure end-to-end IQ
   performance of the ISR enterprise.

       LIFE CYCLE APPROACH TO IMAGE QUALITY FOR ISR ENTERPRISE

2.1. Achieving end-to-end IQ. The approach involves including IQ initiatives in the design,
build, and operational life cycle stages of the collection, dissemination, and exploitation
architecture. The topic of IQ must be addressed during each phase of the architecture
development life cycle to ensure the goal of end-to-end IQ. In order to thread IQ through the
architecture, the 480 ISR WG must maintain the IQ performance of its operations while actively
coordinating with stakeholders responsible for IQ in developmental and operational ISR
architecture components.
2.2. 480 ISR WG IQ Assurance Program. This approach involves the 480 ISR WG
establishing an IQ assurance program within the Wing to maintain and monitor the IQ
architecture performance to optimize operational effectiveness. By leveraging IQ requirements,
metrics, and tools developed by collection systems, the IQ performance thread can be maintained
through the dissemination and exploitation architecture. Integrating IQ initiatives from the front-
end of the AF DCGS architecture and establishing internal processes will thread IQ from target
to analyst exploitation.
   2.2.1. This program provides a methodology for understanding the system’s IQ performance
   and a mechanism to control and maintain that performance. The methodology includes:
       2.2.1.1. Coordinate with ISR stakeholders and IQ programs to thread IQ through the AF
       ISR enterprise.
       2.2.1.2. Advocate for overarching AF guidance that threads IQ efforts across the ISR
       enterprise life cycle to include both acquisitions and sustainment.
           2.2.1.2.1. Advocate for the inclusion of IQ initiatives within the design and build
           stage of the acquisition cycle.
           2.2.1.2.2. Ensure IQ requirements are captured and refined for inclusion into system
           architecture designs to ensure they meet operation mission needs.
           2.2.1.2.3. Ensure IQ metrics and tools are developed and established for measuring
           performance against IQ requirements.
       2.2.1.3. Ensure design, component, and system performance tests include validation of
       IQ performance requirements.
       2.2.1.4. Advocate and support initialization efforts to ensure delivered system meets
       operational requirements.
       2.2.1.5. Establish stakeholder coordination to ensure 480 ISR WG IQ program initiatives
       are integrated with current ISR architecture development, sustainment, and IQ programs.
           2.2.1.5.1. Coordinate and integrate internal 480 ISR WG program initiatives with
           external IQ programs.
               2.2.1.5.1.1. Align efforts with the EIQVP. EIQVP is responsible for the IQ
               sustainment of operational assets.
480ISRWI14-1011 14 JUNE 2013                                                                 11


     2.2.1.6. Support IQ forums, standing and ad-hoc working groups to assist in the
     development of TTPs that support IQ sustainment solutions across the AF ISR
     architecture.
  2.2.2. Establish and maintain processes for the sustainment of IQ within the 480 ISR WG.
  The processes include:
     2.2.2.1. Implement training initiatives to educate Wing personnel on sustaining IQ
     performance and how to identify, troubleshoot, mitigate, and communicate issues.
     Provide IQ training to the appropriate 480 ISR WG exploitation facility users and
     maintainers on IQ issues, resolution processes, and IQ program procedures.
         2.2.2.1.1. Educate personnel to establish SMEs at each DGS exploitation facility.
         2.2.2.1.2. Educate GAs on how to identify, mitigate, and communicate IQ issues that
         can impact the mission.
            2.2.2.1.2.1. Incorporate IQ issues into the appropriate Initial Qualification
            Training (IQT), Mission Qualification (MQT), and Continuation Training (CT)
            modules.
         2.2.2.1.3. Educate maintenance personnel on how to sustain the IQ performance of
         DGS exploitation facilities and architecture. Also, train maintainers to troubleshoot
         and communicate identified IQ performance issues. The EIQVP provides this
         training on a periodic basis.
         2.2.2.1.4. Educate quality control personnel on how to identify, monitor, and assess
         IQ performance. Also, train quality control personnel to troubleshoot and
         communicate identified IQ performance issues.
  2.2.3. Establish an understanding on the current IQ performance of the ISR enterprise. This
  process includes:
     2.2.3.1. Baseline IQ performance. This provides a reference from which performance
     can be measured, monitored, and maintained as well as start the IQ sustainment and
     optimization processes.
     2.2.3.2. Document current architecture. In coordination with AF DCGS stakeholders,
     identify and document the various collection, processing, and dissemination paths
     imagery takes in reaching the Wing units for exploitation.
     2.2.3.3. Measure IQ performance to establish a baseline. Work with AF ISR IQ
     programs on using metrics and tools to conduct a baseline measurement of architecture
     performance.
  2.2.4. Ensure architecture changes meet or exceed current enterprise performance levels
  prior to operational implementation.
     2.2.4.1. Establish a general IQ test plan and tools to conduct operational testing of new
     or modified architectures.
         2.2.4.1.1. Establish a Standard Image Display Set (SIDS) for each ISR sensor
         system.
12                                                          480ISRWI14-1011 14 JUNE 2013


         2.2.4.1.2. Develop general operational testing scenario for reviewing IQ with same
         SIDS data both before and after architecture modification.
         2.2.4.1.3. The SIDS and related EEI questions need to encompass a range of IQ
         performance. This establishes an IQ measurement tool determining the relative
         performance of a system before or after a modification.
         2.2.4.1.4. Formulate EEI questions on the established SIDS that check for various
         levels of IQ based on the scene content.
         2.2.4.1.5. Subjective testing results will be achieved by having a selection of GAs
         (with preferred 5-Level experience exploiting the data type in question) review the
         SIDS imagery and answer the EEIs for both before and after implemented
         architecture changes.
         2.2.4.1.6. Objective testing results will be achieved by sending in the before and after
         SIDS data for quantitative analysis by ISR stakeholders (i.e. EIQVP).
         2.2.4.1.7. Send in subjective and objective testing results for analysis.
         2.2.4.1.8. Utilize results of the subjective and objective tests to determine if
         architecture meets or exceeds the operational requirements.
  2.2.5. Ensure delivered imagery meets operational requirements. Monitor the quality of
  imagery disseminated to the Wing. The quality of imagery maintained by the 480 ISR WG is
  dependent on the IQ received.
     2.2.5.1. DGS facilities will review delivered imagery for any IQ issues as part of its
     GEOINT Exploitation and Dissemination Quality Control (QC) Program Management
     (AFISRAI 14-121), Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Imagery Artifacts
     Resolution Process (AFISRAI 12-122), and/or other equivalent locally employed QC
     monitoring initiatives.
  2.2.6. Establish procedures to sustain the operational capability of the ISR enterprise
  collection, dissemination, and exploitation architectures.
     2.2.6.1. Collection Systems - Support the ISR enterprise efforts to monitor and maintain
     sensor collection and processing performance.
         2.2.6.1.1. DGS facilities will periodically, and upon ad-hoc request, deliver mission
         data as required by EIQVP for analysis and monitoring of airborne collection and
         distribution quality. 480 ISRW will generate a monthly tasker outlining specific
         requirements for delivery and installation.
     2.2.6.2. Dissemination Systems - Support and conduct efforts to monitor dissemination
     system performance.
         2.2.6.2.1. DGS sites will conduct periodic subjective review of SIDS test imagery to
         monitor dissemination system performance.
         2.2.6.2.2. On-site maintenance personnel, the IQPM, or quality control personnel will
         conduct SIDS evaluations. Using SIDS, side-by-side comparisons can be made on
         softcopy exploitation workstations to determine if there is a problem with the
480ISRWI14-1011 14 JUNE 2013                                                                 13


         transmission or the processing of the data. This evaluation checks for anomalies
         introduced by the system and not by the sensor.
         2.2.6.2.3. DGS facilities will submit downloaded SIDS data, as part of the monthly
         mission data delivery submission to EIQVP for objective IQ analysis.
     2.2.6.3. Exploitation Systems - DGS facility personnel will maintain and monitor
     exploitation workstations and facilities. In order to sustain the IQ performance of
     exploitation systems, the performance should be maintained and performance levels
     monitored in-between maintenance activities. This will ensure the systems continue to
     meet the mission requirements while optimizing the Human Visual System (HVS)
     interface to IQ standards. DGS facility will maintain and monitor the exploitation facility
     environment, image processing software on exploitation workstations, and softcopy
     display performance.
         2.2.6.3.1. Design and maintain softcopy exploitation facilities in accordance with
         guidance provide by EIQVP, NGA’s Softcopy Facility Guidelines document, and
         NGA’s Softcopy Exploitation Facility Standard see Chapter 3 Section 3.2.1 for most
         up-to-date version and specifications as of this writing.
         2.2.6.3.2. Maintain exploitation displays by monitoring and periodically calibrating
         displays to maintain the performance standards outlined by EIQVP and NGA’s most
         up-to-date Display Performance Standard see Chapter 3 Section 3.2.2 for most up to
         date version and specifications of this writing.
            2.2.6.3.2.1. On the 5th duty day of each month, email caldata@exelisinc.com
            the CALTOOL display maintenance database for EIQVP review.
         2.2.6.3.3. Monitor and maintain exploitation workstation performance using the
         information collected in the CALTOOL database during the monthly calibration
         process. This software plots the performance trends of displays over time and can be
         used to identify monitors reaching end of life. In submitting this data to EIQVP, as
         indicated in section 2.2.6.3.3.1, they can be contacted to assist in interpreting the
         tracking and trending data.
            2.2.6.3.3.1. Ensure image processing software on exploitation workstations
            complies with NGA’s Softcopy Image Processing Standard and EIQVP guidance
            on proper software settings and processing methodologies see References Section
            for most up to date version as of this writing].
  2.2.7. Establish processes for communicating IQ performance status and related performance
  issues.
     2.2.7.1. The status of system maintenance and performance is collected by the local DGS
     site. This information is then relayed, as needed, to Wing and IQ program stakeholders.
     Identified issues that cannot be addressed locally are communicated to ISR enterprise
     stakeholders through mechanisms such as DRs and community forums. The 480 ISR
     WG IQPD tracks and validates the investigation and resolution of captured DRs. Items
     that cannot be addressed in the current architecture are captured and input as
     requirements (i.e. AF Form 1067s) for development systems.
14                                                        480ISRWI14-1011 14 JUNE 2013


     2.2.7.2. Establish a process for capturing and addressing IQ issues. Through the use of
     discrepancy reports, any user-identified IQ issues will be collected and addressed as part
     of a process that identifies, assesses, and resolves IQ issues.
     2.2.7.3. Establish a DR and resolution tracking process. The DR process provides users
     the ability to report IQ issues with respect to architecture performance. Identified
     deficiencies that cannot be corrected in the current architecture will be submitted as
     candidates for new system requirements.
     2.2.7.4. Develop a response process in order to effectively troubleshoot the nature of the
     issue and identify the correct organization for remediation.
480ISRWI14-1011 14 JUNE 2013                                                                       15

Terms
Artifact/Anomaly—There is a fine line in discerning the terms image artifact and anomaly.
They both describe unexpected observations within an image. The term used is impacted by the
root cause of that unexpected observation. “AFISRAI 14-122 Airborne SAR Imagery Artifact
Resolution Process” refers to SAR image “artifacts” as being related to phenomenology,
collection conditions, and external Electro- Magnetic Interference (EMI) while “anomalies” refer
to issues caused be image architecture performance. Often when an IQ issue is initially observed
the cause is not known. Therefore, it is common for the term artifact or anomaly to be used
interchangeably when referencing an unexpected output observed within an image. Below is
more in-depth description of each term.
Dissemination—In this instruction, dissemination refers to the distribution of images across any
portion of the imaging architecture. For example, an image is collected by a sensor (Collection)
and then disseminated across the architecture (Dissemination) to a user who then exploits the
image (Exploitation).
Human Visual System (HVS)—Sensory system in which the eye and visual cortex collect and
process light to provide a mental image.
Image Quality— In the case of reconnaissance, it is a matter of how accurately the imaging
architecture can capture and convey spatial and tonal (to include spectral) ground truth
information so it can be exploited by an analyst. Image quality is ultimately a subjective
judgment by the human observer as to how well that image visually conveys scene content. It is
a characteristic of an image that measures the perceived image degradation (typically, compared
to an ideal or perfect image).
Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Stakeholders—Refers to anyone who
has a vested interest in the performance of imagery generated and/or distributed on the AF ISR
480ISRWI14-1011 14 JUNE 2013                                                                  19


imaging architectures. Includes organizations and personnel who acquire, deliver, sustain, and
operate that architecture as well as those who exploit and consume imagery and products from
that architecture.
Tap Point—A designated data collection node along a system’s imagery chain where imagery is
processed exploited and/or changes mediums for distribution.
Standard Image Data Set (SIDS)—Is a reference set of imagery with known quality parameters
that can be used to test an imaging path. The SIDS test suite is ideally made up of a variety of
images representative of a particular sensors output but that also represent stress cases for the
capabilities of that imaging system. These set of test images can then be inserted into the front
end of an imaging chain and then can be sampled at various tap point in the imaging architecture.
The input and output test image can then be compared to determine the presence and degree of
any IQ losses. A SIDS set needs to be unique to each sensor type (i.e. EO, IR, SAR, etc).
