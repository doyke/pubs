                                          Attachment 3
     AERIAL APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES PROJECT APPROVAL PROCESS

A3.1. Installation personnel identify the potential for using aerial application of pesticides to
control problem pests.
A3.2. Installation personnel contact the MAJCOM PMP and request that a statement of need be
prepared by a PMP certified in DoD Category 11, Aerial Application.
A3.3. The PMP conducts an on-site visit and prepares an Aerial Application of Pesticides
Statement of Need.
A3.4. An EA or EIS is prepared if the PMP’s Aerial Application of Pesticides Statement of
Need justifies the need for an Aerial Application of Pesticides Project.
A3.5. The installation commander forwards an Aerial Application of Pesticides Statement of
Need and appropriate environmental documentation to the MAJCOM PMC for project approval.
A3.6. The project is either approved or disapproved by the PMC with certification in DoD
Category 11, Aerial Application. The PMC will coordinate all projects with the MAJCOM
Surgeon General’s office for vector control. The PMC sends written project approval or
disapproval back to the requesting installation. (T-0)
A3.7. For projects to be accomplished by the 910 Airlift Wing, approved project documentation
is sent to 910 AW/DOS by the MAJCOM or requesting installation personnel. Project
documentation includes the Aerial Application of Pesticides Statement of Need, environmental
documentation (EA or EIS), and a copy of written MAJCOM PMC approval for the project. See
Figure 3.1.
A3.8. For projects to be accomplished by contract, forward the Aerial Application of Pesticides
Statement of Need, environmental documentation (EA or EIS), and PWS to the MAJCOM PMC
for project approval. An installation project coordinator with DoD Category 11 certification will
perform quality assurance for all contract aerial application projects. (T-0)
A3.9. Once a project is approved, it can continue until changes in the pesticide, application rate,
or the spray area are desired, or until environmental considerations require reexamination of the
project.
A3.10. If a reexamination is performed with appropriate changes justified in the statement of
need and environmental documentation, the project can be resubmitted for approval.
