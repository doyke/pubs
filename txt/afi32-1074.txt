SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
implements required changes from DODI 4150.07 and updates, clarifies, and streamlines
previous guidance for in-service and contract aerial application of pesticides projects at Air
Force installations. It also provides guidance for the use of Air Force resources on other Federal
properties, non-Federal properties, and in foreign countries; and more fully emphasizes
environmental impact and integrated pest management techniques for controlling pests.
1. Background. Application of pesticides from rotary and fixed-wing aircraft permits rapid
coverage of large areas and treating of areas inaccessible to ground-control equipment. It is
particularly useful when high operational efficiency is necessary to control unexpected outbreaks
of vector-borne disease, management of invasive species, and unusual outbreaks of other pests.
2. Objectives.
    2.1. Promote and support:
       2.1.1. Military readiness and joint force health protection.
       2.1.2. Installation program planning and maintenance.
       2.1.3. Pollution prevention, conservation of natural resources, and environmental
       compliance.
       2.1.4. Integrated pest management.
    2.2. Provide well-trained, technically competent, aerial pesticide application personnel.
3. Responsibilities.
    3.1. Secretary of the Air Force. DODI 4150.07 tasks the Air Force to:
       3.1.1. Maintain a large-area, fixed-wing aerial application capability to control disease
       vectors, vegetation, and pests of vegetation, and to treat oil spills in combat areas, on
       DOD installations, or in response to a Presidential declared disaster/emergency.
       3.1.2. Train aerial pesticide application air crews and ground support personnel.

       Stafford Act.
       3.1.4. Ensure that foreign disaster relief aerial application projects are in compliance
       with DOD directive (DODD) 5100.46, Foreign Disaster Relief; and that projects
       involving military support to civil authorities are in compliance with DODD 3025.1,
       Military Support to Civil Authorities (MSCA), and Air Force instruction (AFI) 10-802,
       Military Support to Civil Authorities.
    3.2. The Air Force Surgeon General (HQ USAF/SG). Establishes policy and resources to
    evaluate worldwide vector borne disease threats. Interfaces with major commands
    (MAJCOM), Department of Defense (DoD), and other Federal, state, and international

guidance. If the need is not justified, the proposed project can be terminated and considerable
resources can be saved by not starting the environmental documentation process.

     AERIAL APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES PROJECT APPROVAL PROCESS

A3.1. Installation personnel identify the potential for using aerial application of pesticides to
control problem pests.
A3.2. Installation personnel contact the MAJCOM PMP and request that a statement of need be
prepared by a PMP certified in DOD Category 11, Aerial Application.
A3.3. The PMP conducts an on-site visit and prepares an Aerial Application of Pesticides
Statement of Need.
A3.4. An EA or EIS is prepared if the PMP’s Aerial Application of Pesticides Statement of
Need justifies the need for an Aerial Application of Pesticides Project.
A3.5. The installation commander forwards an Aerial Application of Pesticides Statement of
Need and appropriate environmental documentation to the MAJCOM PMC for project approval.
A3.6. The project is either approved or disapproved by the PMC with certification in DOD
Category 11, Aerial Application. The PMC will coordinate all projects with the MAJCOM
Surgeon General’s office for vector control. The PMC sends written project approval or
disapproval back to the requesting installation.
A3.7. For projects to be accomplished by the 910 Airlift Wing, approved project documentation
is sent to 910 AW/DOS by the MAJCOM or requesting installation personnel. Project
documentation includes the Aerial Application of Pesticides Statement of Need, environmental
documentation (EA or EIS), and a copy of written MAJCOM PMC approval for the project. See
Figure 1.
A3.8. For projects to be accomplished by contract, forward the Aerial Application of Pesticides
Statement of Need, environmental documentation (EA or EIS), and PWS to the MAJCOM PMC
for project approval. An installation project coordinator with DoD Category 11 certification will
perform quality assurance for all contract aerial application projects.
A3.9. Once a project is approved, it can continue until changes in the pesticide, application rate,
or the spray area are desired, or until environmental considerations require reexamination of the
project.
A3.10. If a reexamination is performed with appropriate changes justified in the statement of
need and environmental documentation, the project can be resubmitted for approval.
