                                            Chapter 1

                               MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY

1.1. Scheduling. Aircraft flying and maintenance scheduling is a planned, methodical approach
to achieving maintenance and flying goals. The weekly flying and maintenance schedule directly
dictates the workload of a major portion of wing personnel from flightline mechanics to dining
facility personnel. The wing flying-hour program is directly tied to wing funding and the
readiness of aircrews and aircraft to perform their war-time mission. This is one of the most
important products the wing produces so the right resources must be dedicated to producing an
effective and efficient plan.
1.2. Scheduler. In some wings, operations scheduling is an additional duty for a lieutenant or
captain. Optimally, Operations Schedulers should be assigned to the function for a minimum of 1
year. Remember, these are the wing experts at building the plan and everything they do directly
impacts the operations (ops) tempo of the wing. Committing personnel for at least a year will
improve consistency and the opportunity to meet the flying-hour program while efficiently
executing the mission, increasing effective pilot training and reducing turbulence for the wing.
1.3. Collocate. One way to facilitate communication and enhance understanding of the impact
of program decisions is when possible to collocate the operations and maintenance schedulers.
This option is a proven method to improve communication but care must be exercised to ensure
that collocation does not interfere with their respective functions and organizational/leadership
structure.
1.4. Annual Plan. The annual plan is the most important element of the flying-hour program.
With smart planning, programming and updating of the immediate (in-year) and long-range (out-
year) programs, the difficulties of managing this program can be largely eliminated. With the
risk of being redundant, this is one area where your investment of time and energy can return big
dividends to wing personnel. Unfortunately, experience has shown that too often many wing
operations and maintenance schedulers do not fully understand the program. This indicates a lack
of appropriate knowledge driven primarily by a lack of instructions (AFI/ACCIs) familiarization
and position experience. As a result, many programs are developed and submitted without proper
planning or foresight. Programs that are not carefully worked and planned waste an inordinate
amount of resources in preparation and may cause the unit to fall short of meeting their flying-
hour goals.
1.5. Planning. The more planning factors that can be built into the flying schedule, the more
stability you will have to meet the operations and maintenance workload. Additionally,
maintenance schedulers can target maintenance resources and use them more efficiently to
reduce the variation within the scheduling process. It is critical that maintenance analysis, along
with Plans, Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D), perform a monthly maintenance, personnel
and facility capability study then cross-check this study with the flying-hour program to ensure
the program is supportable. If the unit’s mission cannot be supported within the unit’s organic
capacity limitations, then changes must be made to ensure successful execution. Always be
mindful that resources (personnel, aircraft, and equipment) are not over-tasked. When capability
is exceeded, notify squadron and group senior leadership so the plan can be adjusted to meet
objectives. Remember, failure by the schedulers to make appropriate inputs and properly project
capabilities could force the wing or squadron to try to execute an unsupportable program.
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                      7


1.6. Deployments. As the program is developed, schedulers should also consider the time
required to prepare for deployments. Scheduling normal flying or surges in the days immediately
preceding a deployment/temporary duty (TDY) may impact the ability of maintenance personnel
to prepare the aircraft appropriately. Personnel need time to prepare for deployments (pre-
deployment briefs, out-processing and personal business). Conversely, you have a problem if
you plan to resume normal operations too quickly after returning to home station. This is a sure
way to deplete your resources, wear down your personnel and fail to meet your programmed
goals.
1.7. Unscheduled Events. Solid planning is the key to success, but pop-up events can influence
or cause turbulence to the scheduling process. For example, poor winter weather has forced units
to heavily weight their programs toward the good weather months via planned attrition.
However, weather being what it is--unpredictable; it may not materialize as planned. If this
occurs, units are then faced with a dilemma. Maintain the sortie utilization (UTE) plan as is or
overfly the program. The recommended solution is to take advantage of the unexpected "good"
weather and fly. However, care must be exercised not to exceed the maintenance capability for
the sake of getting ahead. If you overfly or underfly the approved program by more than 10
percent, then units should reflow the balance of their flying program.
1.8. Overflys. In developing the reflow, care must also be exercised to ensure sufficient
sorties/hours remain in the months from which the sorties/hours are removed. This will ensure
unit tasking and operational training requirements are met. Banking "extra" sorties and hours
prior to the summer months will possibly allow more latitude in leave scheduling and offer
personnel some downtime. "Overflys" of programmed sorties and hours must be coordinated
fully between your OG and MXG.
1.9. Planning Impacts. It is imperative maintenance schedulers understand and appreciate
operational requirements and how they impact planning efforts. The operations scheduler must
understand and appreciate how his/her decisions will impact, not just maintenance, but all wing
agencies supporting the mission. For example, a single configuration change can take 2 to 4
hours and as many as six people. This change will have a definite impact on maintenance’s
ability to manage work shifts, repair aircraft and perform preventive maintenance.
1.10. Program Changes. The point of contact for changes that impact the overall yearly flying
program is Operations and Training Division (ACC/A3T). All changes that impact the overall
programmed hours or sorties must be approved by ACC/A3T. If the changes do not affect the
overall program, a copy of the reflow must be provided to ACC/A3T to ensure that the correct
numbers are being reported at the local, MAJCOM and Air Staff level.
1.11. Surges. One method for generating a high number of sorties and hours is a sortie surge.
Surges, if properly planned and executed, can potentially lessen the impact of "summer" high
sortie UTE rates due to the restrictive nature of the "winter" operating environment. That is, by
surging, a large portion of the required monthly program can be accomplished in a short period
of time. In turn, this allows for a significantly lower UTE rate for the remainder of the month. At
the same time, carefully executed surges can have a positive effect on unit esprit de corps.
Following are some tested basic principles that go a long way toward developing a successful
surge program.
   1.11.1. Surges should never be treated nor executed as a casual or "spur of the moment"
   event. Instead, surges should be built into a unit's annual flying program and advertised base-
 8                                     ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012


     wide. In turn, the program should include target sortie goals, planned dates and backup dates.
     Future planning does several things. First, the entire base is aware that something non routine
     is going to occur at a point in time and they need to plan and program their activities
     accordingly. Second, the maintenance community, by knowing when surges are
     programmed, can ensure the force is properly managed so that preventative maintenance
     actions are properly scheduled and the aircraft phase/inspection flow is managed in
     preparation for the surge. Third, personnel resources can be managed to ensure maximum
     availability of the maintenance force to support the surge.
     1.11.2. Surges are a significant base event and, as such, can be disruptive to base activities.
     Therefore, the surge must be worth the effort. In this light, short-notice, 1-day surges are
     often, in the long-term, counterproductive. The extensive preparation beforehand, and
     recovery afterwards, often outweighs the advantages of a 1-day surge. It is often impossible
     to justify the effort for a "surge" that produces very little in return. On the other hand, a lot of
     energy is expended to ensure local Salty Nation (or equivalent) exercises are successful. A
     surge falls into the same category and requires the same planning effort to be successful.
     1.11.3. Be aware that sortie surges can have a negative impact on your training program and
     your hourly program. Because sortie duration is usually shortened to facilitate the surge, the
     aircrew training benefits often drop in relation to the sortie duration. Additionally, if you fly
     too many surges and do not keep an eye on your Average Sortie Duration (ASD), you may
     have to add more sorties than originally programmed at the end of the year to make your
     hourly program.
1.12. Utilization (UTE). In units tasked to fly out an annual flying-hour program, UTE is the
key to ensuring success. UTE is a measure of performance--the goal the wing is trying to
achieve. To ensure success, you must publish the program and make sure the people understand
it. You must also track program progress by squadron and reward the people when the goal is
reached. Remember, do not chase flying-hours. Track the ASD. It is the link between sorties and
flying hours.
1.13. So what should you do?
     1.13.1. Plan what you fly and fly what you plan.
     1.13.2. Agree on the basics and write it down: Standard flying window, Rules of
     Engagement (ROE) for surges, night flying, Cross Country (XC) sorties, weekend duty, quiet
     hours, training days, standard configurations, minimum/standard turn times, XC ROE, crew
     ready/step minimums, standard turn times, quick turn times, etc.
     1.13.3. Establish a standardized approval authority for AF Form 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying
     Schedule Coordination, scheduling changes (If it is too easy to change the schedule, it will
     not be built right the first time).
     1.13.4. Be aware that aircraft should rarely be “added”. If aircraft are added because
     maintenance cannot provide enough front lines, something else is wrong and most likely the
     problem is being compounded. There is a domino effect: How many more aircraft will you
     add to the “broke” pile before you call “knock it off?”
     1.13.5. Closely monitor the flying window. The window drives shift scheduling, but be
     aware, operations and maintenance are not the only agencies involved in sortie generation.
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                         9


   Petrol, Oils, and Lubricants (POL), Air Traffic Control (ATC), Weather and many others will
   assist in the effort. Supervision must cover the entire flying window and then some. The
   length of the flying window determines effectiveness of maintenance “fix” shift. Turbulence
   in the flying window equals stress on the flight-line--keep it consistent throughout the week.
   Combining a late start today with an early start tomorrow hurts!
   1.13.6. For tanker and airlift units, communicate constantly between the sortie generation
   element and the plans and scheduling element. It is vital in the management of the isochronal
   inspection concept. This communication ensures aircraft are available for their scheduled
   dock input and available to meet mission requirements.
   1.13.7. Ensure your maintenance schedulers are flowing aircraft -6 maintenance inspections,
   time changes, and Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) requirements as smoothly as
   possible to maximize aircraft availability and reduce excessive maintenance downtime.
   1.13.8. Insist on a well-crafted shortand long-term plan. A unit cannot plan what they do not
   know. Conversely, a unit that fails to plan--plans to fail. In tanker and airlift units, scheduling
   flexibility is the key to success with adherence to sound maintenance management and
   policy.
   1.13.9. Do not reconfigure aircraft between gos, unless there is an overwhelming need to do
   so. Work with your operations counterpart to fly the same configuration for the entire week,
   if possible. Reconfiguring drains manpower from troubleshooting, repairing, inspecting,
   servicing, launching and recovering.
   1.13.10. Do not allow weekend duty to become routine. Weekend duty should be based on
   rules and aircraft should not be worked unless there is no other option to replace a Monday
   flyer. XCs should rarely, if ever, return on a weekend. Remember, to return on a weekend
   you must call multiple people in from a variety of base agencies to support the return and
   recovery.
   1.13.11. Review the next weeks flying window length. It should be looked at from both the
   wing and squadron perspective.
1.14. You may have problems if some of the following are evident within your program:
   1.14.1. The “lead operations scheduler” change s too frequently (i .e., week-to- week or
   month-to-month).
   1.14.2. AF Form 2407 is approved by whoever is around.
   1.14.3. Late landings or early take-offs are the norm.
   1.14.4. You are reconfiguring instead of servicing in the turn unless circumstances dictate.
   1.14.5. Fix rates down, deviations are up, ground aborts and cannibalization rate are on the
   rise.
   1.14.6. No attention given to the number of hours required and the number of jets that can be
   phased in a given month.
   1.14.7. Flying shift is fixing aircraft.
   1.14.8. Major/numerous changes to next week's flying.

   1.14.9. The maintenance schedule does not receive the same attention as the flying schedule.
   1.14.10. Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness is 100% but there are many overdue
   inspections.
   1.14.11. Weekend duty is the norm rather than the exception.
   1.14.12. Technicians do not know what time they are coming to work tomorrow.
1.15. Approach. Remember, this is not an art or science, just a planned approach to mission
accomplishment. It is imperative you know your schedulers and you understand and monitor
their programs. Balance is the key to managing mission requirements with maintenance
capabilities.

                                            Chapter 2

                       GENERAL RESPONSIBILITY AND POLICY

2.1. Responsibilities. Commanders at all levels are responsible for compliance with this
instruction.
2.2. Policy. This instruction provides procedures and audit methods for units to develop their
flying and maintenance scheduling program and analyze their effectiveness. It is intended to be a
local tool for operations and maintenance activities to use in support of their programs.
Reviewing reasons for deviating from the flying and maintenance schedule will allow wing
commanders (WG/CC) and staff to evaluate unit flying program and scheduling procedures.
Higher Headquarters (HHQ) management attention is directed to those areas beyond a unit's
control.
2.3. Objectives. This instruction allows units the flexibility to meet mission requirements
through effective flying and maintenance scheduling. Scheduling evaluation procedures provides
an audit trail to identify problems in flying and maintenance schedules. The primary purpose of
unit scheduling assessment is to evaluate the effectiveness of the unit's flying program in support
of combat capability.
2.4. Applicability. This publication is applicable to all CAF units possessing or supporting
CAF aircraft, including contractor maintained aircraft.
2.5. Reporting Requirements. Units will use the Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS)
reporting procedures. This includes contractor-maintained, wing assigned aircraft. In the event
that the contractor is not obligated to utilize IMDS, the MXG commander is responsible to
ensure all reporting procedures are followed. MAF units deployed to a combatant command
reporting through CAF will continue to use G081 for tracking and scheduling deployed assets or
equipment.
2.6. Standards. Standards and goals assist commanders in assessing the effectiveness of unit
performance. The CAF aircraft maintenance scheduling effectiveness standard is 95 percent.
There are two aircraft flying scheduling effectiveness (FSE) standards developed by HQ
ACC/A4J, approved by HQ ACC/ A4, and provided to the user each September. Overall FSE
rate is measured using recorded deviation data as outlined in Chapter 4. Operations and
Maintenance (O&M) FSE rate includes deviations only in the maintenance and operations
categories.
2.7. Waivers. Waiver authority for this publication rests with HQ ACC/A4Q. ACC waiver
requests are submitted by the WG/CC. See Attachment 2, Waiver/Change Request Format.
2.8. Standardization. Wings will develop a supplement to this instruction standardizing
scheduling practices for the wing and each assigned mission design series (MDS). Minimum
topics will include standardized flying windows, specific surge rules, quiet hour policies, cross
country take-offs and returns, minimum turn times, crew ready times, etc. Supplements will
include local schedule input and publishing deadlines along with any wing unique requirements.
   2.8.1. (Added-36WG) Andersen AFB (AAFB) is subject to multiple deployments by
   several different mission oriented airframe units/squadrons at any time. Therefore, home
 12                                  ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012


   station established standards will be used as a baseline with the 36 MXG/CC and 36 OG/CC
   having final approval authority.
2.9. Airframe Capability and Scheduling. To ensure accurate projection of operations and
maintenance capacity, units will compute airframe capabilities using only the number of Primary
Aircraft Inventory (PAI) aircraft; do not include Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI) or attrition
reserve aircraft. Operational and training schedules will be based on the capability of PAI aircraft
to execute the schedule. The OG/CC and MXG/CC will ensure BAI and attrition reserve aircraft
are not computed when building the flying program.
   2.9.1. (Added-36WG) In coordination with the 36 MXG/CC and 36 OG/CC deployed units
   will execute the portion of their home station flying hour program allocated for deployed
   operations. Aircraft are assigned for execution of deployed flying hours to fulfill PACOM
   Theater Campaign Plan (TCP) requirements.
2.10. Alert Aircraft. Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) officer in charge (OIC) and
Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC) will ensure aircraft entering or coming off alert
are managed to avoid Hangar Queen candidacy as a result of extended idle alert periods.
Maintenance Data Systems Analysis (MDSA) will review sortie performance and reliability
trends of aircraft coming off alert/immediate response (IR) and present performance analysis to
affected AMU maintenance operations and MOF maintenance operations.
2.11. Electronic Publishing. Plans and schedules may be published via electronic means (e.g.,
web pages or E-mail) provided operations security is not compromised. Normal daily operations
and training schedules are FOUO and should not be restricted to classified systems.
   2.11.1. (Added-36WG) 36 MOF/MXOOP will distribute/publish the 36 WG weekly and
   monthly flying and maintenance schedules electronically via encrypted E-mail.
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                       13

             FLYING AND MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING PROCEDURES

3.1. Flying and Maintenance Planning Cycle. The objective of the flying and maintenance
planning cycle is to execute the wing flying hour program (FHP) consistent with operational
requirements (AFI 11-102, Flying Hour Program Management) and maintenance capabilities.
These procedures enhance operations and maintenance interface. The flying and maintenance
planning cycle begins with the annual allocation of flying hours and UTE rates. For additional
information on flying hour allocation and planning procedures for CAF units, AFI 11-102_ACC
Sup, Flying Hour Program Management. Maintenance schedulers must understand operational
needs to determine supportability and operations schedulers must consider maintenance
capabilities. Maintenance and operations schedulers will develop a proposed annual flying plan
balancing both operational requirements and maintenance capabilities. The annual plan, detailed
by month, will evaluate the capability of maintenance to support the annual flying hour program.
The plan will be coordinated and consolidated by OSS Current Operations Flight operations
scheduling and forwarded to the current operations flight commander, AMXS/CC and
Maintenance Operations Officer (MOO), Munitions Officer/Munitions Control, MOS/CC,
MOF/CC and MOF PS&D. The printed wing plan will include an assessment of the wing’s
ability to execute the flying hour program. The plan will be presented to the OG and MXG CCs
for approval before being approved by the WG/CC. Commit the fewest number of aircraft
possible to meet programmed UTE rate standards and goals. The annual plan is further refined
into quarterly/monthly operations and maintenance plans and then into weekly schedules using
the guidelines contained in the following sub-paragraphs.
   3.1.1. The number and length of sorties are of prime consideration in planning to meet
   programmed UTE rate standards/goals based on Flying Hour Program Development based
   on RAP Models or course syllabus.
   3.1.2. Principal areas of concern are in the overall flying schedules. For mission
   accomplishment and improved efficiency, the following must be considered: maximize crew
   training on all flights, plan alternate missions when possible, ensure configurations and fuel
   loads are accurate, establish launch and recovery patterns, and utilize historical attrition data.
   3.1.3. (Added-36WG) The 36 WG is a sustained forward operating support organization
   and as such is not assigned aircraft, nor is it allocated annual flying hours and utilization
   (UTE) rates.
       3.1.3.1. (Added-36WG) Weekly and monthly flying schedules will be coordinated
       through the 36 OG/CC, 36 MXG/CC, EBS/CC, EAMXS/CC prior to presentation to the
       36 WG/CC, or delegated authority.
       NOTE: Paragraph 3.2. and 3.3. of parent instruction does not apply. (see paragraph
       3.1.3)

3.2. The Proposed Flying Hour Program Requirements.
   3.2.1. Proposed FHP Process. The Proposed FHP process initiates funding and a unit’s
   FHP for the next fiscal year. MOF PS&D and OSS/OSO lead the development of their
   Wing’s Proposed FHP. It’s critical that all operational requirements are reviewed and
14                                ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012


  weighed against maintenance capability factors. Units will ensure thorough coordination with
  all assigned squadrons and aircraft maintenance units prior to ACC submission.
     3.2.1.1. Developing the Proposed FHP response: MOF/PS&D and OSS/OSO will
     ensure the Proposed FHP process is initiated NLT 15 March. MOF PS&D will request
     that MDSA accomplish an airframe, personnel, and facility capabilities assessment, using
     ACC templates for each AMU based on historical data. The capabilities are due back to
     MOF PS&D no later than the last workday of March. This process identifies operational
     requirements and maintenance capability for the next fiscal year. Units will perform the
     flowing steps prior to submitting their Flying Hour Program to ACC/A3T.
     3.2.1.2. MOF MDSA will develop an initial airframe, personnel and facility capability
     study using ACC model templates.
     3.2.1.3. MOF PS&D will refine the initial MDSA airframe capability by applying
     projected maintenance requirements to the historical data. MOF PS&D will provide
     copies of the capability study to each Operating Squadron (OS) operations scheduling
     AMU OIC/NCOIC, AMXS/CC/MOO and to MXS/CC/MOO.
     3.2.1.4. NLT 5 duty-days after OSS/OSO receives (NLT 31 May IAW AFI 11-102 and
     ACC Sup) the “Proposed FHP” message, OSS/OSO will provide MOF PS&D a copy of
     “Proposed FHP” message and a breakdown of operational requirements to include at a
     minimum the following data:
         3.2.1.4.1. O&M days
         3.2.1.4.2. Sorties/hours/UTE rates (hourly & Sortie) required (programmed)
         3.2.1.4.3. Sorties/hours Scheduled (programmed + attrition)
         3.2.1.4.4. Average sorties per O&M day
         3.2.1.4.5. NLT 15 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the “Proposed FHP” message,
         MOF PS&D will provide Proposed FHP maintenance capability projections in a
         monthly format to OS operations officer, AMU OIC/NCOIC, AMXS/CC/MOO.
         Projections include “Proposed FHP” operational requirements, an assessment of
         maintenance’s ability to support the monthly contract requirements, and an overall
         assessment of the unit’s maintenance capability to meet the annual flying hour
         program.
     3.2.1.5. NLT 25 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the “Proposed FHP” message, MOF
     PS&D will gather the AMXS and OS coordinated responses to the Proposed FHP
     message and forward them to OSS Current Operations Flight operations scheduling
     section for consolidation into a comprehensive package that includes a breakdown of the
     following items by OS/AMU:
     3.2.1.6. Utilization (UTE) rates.
         3.2.1.6.1. Hourly UTE (HUTE) rates are the number of hours an aircraft must fly per
         month in order to meet the annual requirement. HUTE rates will be computed by
         month for the entire fiscal year for contracted (required) hours and scheduled hours.
         The HUTE rate equals the number of hours per month divided by the number of
         Primary Mission Aerospace Vehicle Inventory (PMAI) aircraft.
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                   15


        3.2.1.6.2. Sortie UTE (SUTE) rates are the number of sorties an aircraft must fly per
        month in order to meet the annual requirement. SUTE rates will be computed by
        month for the entire fiscal year for contracted (required) sorties and scheduled sorties.
        The SUTE rate equals the number of sorties per month divided by the number of
        PMAI aircraft.
            3.2.1.6.2.1. Aircraft Authorizations:
                3.2.1.6.2.1.1. HQ USAF specifies the PMAI for each unit in the USAF
                Programs: PA, Aerospace Vehicles and Flying Hours.
                3.2.1.6.2.1.2. Units projected to possess less aircraft than authorized may be
                assigned a revised PMAI or Chargeable Aircraft Authorization (CHRG) for
                UTE and flying hour computations. The CHRG will be displayed for each
                applicable unit in allocation messages.
     3.2.1.7. Sorties contracted/scheduled per day. Compute the number of sorties (hours)
     required per O&M day to meet the operational requirement using the formula: Number of
     sorties (hours) required divided by number of O&M days in a given month. Sorties
     (hours) per day will be computed by month for each operational squadron/AMU.
     3.2.1.8. Monthly scheduled sorties. Compute monthly scheduled sortie requirements
     using the formula: (Number of sorties or hours required) divided by (1 minus the attrition
     factor). EXAMPLE: 1,000 sorties or hours required divided by (1 minus 0.15) equals
     1,177 sorties or hours to schedule. Remember to round any part up to the next whole
     sortie.
     3.2.1.9. Phase/Isochronal (ISO) inspection dock capability. Compute the number of
     Phases/ISO inspections to be accomplished in order to meet operational requirements for
     each AMU, by month, for the entire fiscal year. Compute dock capability using the
     formula (number of O&M days) divided by (number of phase days) times (inspection
     cycle).
     3.2.1.10. MOF/PS&D and MOF/MDSA will compute and provide the phase/ISO dock
     capability projection. This projection will be reviewed with AMXS and MXS
     supervision. Compute dock capability using the formula (number of O&M days) divided
     by (number of PH/PE/ISO days) multiplied by (inspection cycle) an example (20 O&M
     days/5 day phases X 400 hour inspection cycle = 1600 hours).This number correlates to
     how many airframe inspection hours maintenance can support in a given month.
     3.2.1.11. NLT 30 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the “Proposed FHP” message, MOF
     PS&D and OSS/OSO will co-chair a Proposed FHP meeting with all required agencies.
     Agencies will include but are not limited to AMXS, MXS, MUNS, MSG (i.e. Fuels) and
     OS. Capability studies and operational requirements will be discussed and reviewed. Any
     maintenance, operational, or support shortfall will be noted and briefed to the MXG, OG
     and MXG CCs.
        3.2.1.11.1. MOF PS&D and OSS/OSO will compile the airframe, personnel, and
        facility capability studies, operational requirements (paragraph 3.2.1.4), and any
        noted shortfall. A package will be prepared and briefed to group commanders
        (OG/MXG/MSG) prior to Wing/ CC final approval. Once approved, the OG and
 16                                 ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012


           MXG will provide ACC/A3T/A4J a coordinated “Proposed FHP” response message.
           The message will depict the operational requirements by month for the next fiscal
           year and provide an overall capability statement of the unit’s ability to meet the plan.
           Maintenance and operational shortfalls will be noted and explained.
           3.2.1.11.2. NLT 35 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the “Proposed FHP” message,
           once compiled, packages will be presented to the MSG, OG and MXG/CCs (or
           equivalents) before being presented to the WG/CC for final approval. MOF PS&D
           will review the comprehensive package submitted to OSS Current Operations Flight
           operations scheduling section and provide feedback to AMU OIC/NCOIC,
           AMXS/CC/MOO and MXG/CC if required. Final assessments of maintenance
           capabilities to support the operations "Proposed FHP" projections are then sent to
           ACC/A3TB and ACC/A4J. The “Proposed FHP” response message is due to
           ACC/A3T NLT the “Propose FHP” message suspense date.
3.3. COMBAT AIR FORCES (CAF) Baseline Allocation Message. Once COMACC
approves a unit’s Proposed FHP response, the CAF Baseline Allocation message will become the
contract between CAF (ACC) and the unit. This message will be forwarded to the unit NLT 1
Sep each year and will be the basis for the unit’s annual flying and maintenance planning
process.
 NOTE: Except for emergencies or HHQ tasking at year-end (e.g., hurricane evacuations or
 air sovereignty scrambles), UNIT FLYING HOUR PROGRAMS WILL NOT BE
 OVERFLOWN by more than 20 hours per MDS WITHOUT PRIOR HHQ APPROVAL.
 Unit commanders are not required to "zero out" their annual flying hour program at the end of
 the fiscal year. The last flying day of the year should be planned and flown as a normal flying
 day and should not be truncated solely because the annual flying hour contract has been
 satisfied.
3.4. Annual Maintenance Planning Cycle. The annual planning cycle develops the wings
maintenance and operation plan to support/sustain the FHP established by the CAF Baseline
Allocation message. MOF PS&D and OSS/OSO leads the development of their wing’s annual
plan. Both maintenance and operations are required to refine their requirements and re-evaluate
their capability to support the FHP. It is critical that all factors are considered and operational
requirements are balanced with maintenance capability throughout the year. MOF/PS&D will
identify all major maintenance impacting airframe availability using IMDS products, such as
Time Distribution Index (TDI), Planning Requirements (PRA), and Workable TCTO Report
background products to determine long-range maintenance requirements. MOF/ PS&D &
MDSA will validate all capability studies. OSS/OSO will validate their requirements and O&M
days.
   3.4.1. Developing the Annual Plan: MOF/PS&D and OSS/OSO will ensure the annual
   planning process is initiated NLT 15 March and their Final Flying Hour Program (Proposed
   FHP response) message is submitted to ACC/A3T/A4J NLT the “Propose FHP” message
   suspense date. Units will ensure the following steps prior to submitting their final Flying
   Hour Program (Annual plan).
       3.4.1.1. (Added-36WG) All long range maintenance planning will be accomplished by
       deployed units and their associated home station PS&D offices. Considerations for
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                    17


     aircraft preparedness and deployed maintenance needs are addressed during that process.
     All subparagraphs are not applicable.
  3.4.2. MOF/PS&D and MOF/MDSA build and validate all capability studies which
  includes: airframe, personnel, facility and phase/ISO dock projections. The studies will be
  reviewed and analyzed with AMXS and MXS supervision. Capability shortfalls will be noted
  and briefed to the MXG/CC.
     3.4.2.1. MOF/MDSA will provide updated attrition factors to MOF PS&D and
     OSS/OSO.
     3.4.2.2. MOF/PS&D will provide all known major maintenance which includes but is
     not limited to: Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM), Phase/ISO, Refurbishment, and
     major modification schedules.
     3.4.2.3. MOF PS&D will calculate and provide an average aircraft availability per
     month.
     3.4.2.4. OSS/OSO will validate their monthly breakdown of hours and sorties (based on
     RAP/contingency/curriculum requirements) in the baseline allocation message and
     provide maintenance the following planning factors:
         3.4.2.4.1. TDYs (if known)
         3.4.2.4.2. Exercises (if known)
         3.4.2.4.3. Safety, training, UTE, family, and all non-O&M days
         3.4.2.4.4. O&M days
         3.4.2.4.5. Sorties/hours/UTE rate required (programmed). Yearly requirement broken
         out by month
         3.4.2.4.6. Sorties/hours Scheduled (programmed + attrition). Yearly requirement
         broken out by month
         3.4.2.4.7. Average sorties per O&M day
         3.4.2.4.8. Suggested turn pattern
         3.4.2.4.9. Configuration/munition requirements
  3.4.3. NLT 15 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the “Proposed FHP” message,
  MOF/PS&D and OSS/OSO will chair an annual planning meeting with all required agencies.
  Agencies will include but are not limited to AMXS, MXS, MUNS, OS and MSG (i.e. Fuels
  servicing). Capability studies, operational requirements and planning factors will be reviewed
  and validated during this meeting. Maintenance and operational shortfalls will be noted and
  briefed to the MXG/CC and OG/CC.
  3.4.4. NLT 30 duty days after OSS/OSO receives the “Proposed FHP” message,
  MOF/PS&D and OSS/OSO will prepare and brief the wing’s annual maintenance and flying
  hour program to the group commanders (MXG/OG/MSG) prior to Wing/CC approval. Once
  Wing/CC approved, the OG and MXG will provide ACC/A3T/A4J a coordinated final
  Flying Hour Program message. The message will depict the operational requirements by
  month for the next fiscal year and provide an overall capability statement of the unit’s ability
 18                                 ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012


   to meet the plan. NOTE: If maintenance or operational capability does not exist to meet
   peacetime operational requirements due to split peacetime/AEF operations, or if a operational
   event impacts a unit’s ability to execute, the unit has the option to revise their Flying Hour
   Program. This can be accomplished when submitting their annual plan or they can reflow
   sorties/hours quarterly, as required. Changes to the total hours/sorties on the CAF Baseline
   allocation message require justification by the unit.
3.5. Quarterly Scheduling:
   3.5.1. Quarterly scheduling starts with the operational requirement for flying hours, UTE
   rate, airframe availability, alert, and other related scheduling data. The OS operations officer
   provides these requirements to AMU OIC/NCOIC, MUNS Control NCOIC/Munitions OIC
   and PS&D NLT the first weekly scheduling meeting the month prior to the effective quarter.
   AMU supervision and the OS operations officer discuss these requirements at the scheduling
   meeting before the quarter being scheduled. Launch/recovery blocks, sortie flow timing, etc.,
   are established based on training ranges (TR) and air refueling (AR) allocations.
      3.5.1.1. (Added-36WG) Upon arrival, deployed PS&D personnel will produce an
      executable quarterly maintenance plan to support deployed operational requirements for
      the duration of the deployment as soon as said requirements are made available by EBS
      schedulers.
               NOTE: Quarterly maintenance plan will be coordinated with 36 OG/CC, 36
               MXG/CC, EBS/CC, and EAMXS/CC prior to approval.
   3.5.2. Schedulers ensure quarterly plans are as detailed and accurate as possible at the time
   of preparation. Include known special missions, depot maintenance input and output
   schedules, higher headquarters commitments, and lateral command support requirements.
      3.5.2.1. Use the following priority to determine which objectives to support if a lack of
      resources prevents meeting requirements:
          3.5.2.1.1. Alert Commitments.
          3.5.2.1.2. Higher-headquarters directed missions.
          3.5.2.1.3. Training.
   3.5.3. The OG/CC and MXG/CC jointly chair a quarterly meeting (calendar quarter, Oct -
   Dec, Jan - Mar, Apr - Jun, Jul - Sep) NLT the monthly meeting (can be held in conjunction
   with) prior to the effective quarter. A rolling 3-month plan briefed each month meets the
   intent of the quarterly scheduling process. OSS Current Operations Flight operations
   scheduling compiles, coordinates, and briefs the quarterly plan to include operational
   requirements, support capability, and difficulties expected. This meeting may be held in
   conjunction with the weekly scheduling meeting or as a separate scheduling meeting. Once
   an approved quarterly plan is established, OSS Current Operations Flight operations
   scheduling will forward a copy to OS, AMXS, MOS, OG, and MXG/CCs along with all
   scheduling agencies. The plan will be posted so it may be viewed by both maintenance and
   operations. When changes to the quarterly plan are required to achieve the unit objectives,
   make necessary adjustments to the monthly and weekly plans while keeping within unit
   capabilities.
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                  19


      3.5.3.1. (Added-36WG) Within ten days of a unit’s arrival the 36 OG/CC & 36
      MXG/CCs will chair a deployed OPS/MX scheduling meeting to establish an
      overarching execution plan for the duration of the deployment. Changes to operational
      requirements and maintenance supportability will be managed monthly and briefed to the
      36 OG/CC & 36 MXG/CCs in conjunction with the weekly scheduling meeting.
3.6. Monthly Scheduling:
   3.6.1. Monthly plans refine quarterly requirements. Forecast and monitor requirements for
   the current and next 2 months. Include predictable maintenance factors based on historical
   data along with other inputs, such as flow times for maintenance, turnaround times and parts
   replacement schedules from the long-range plan. Additionally, include all known operational
   events (e.g., exercises, deployments, and surges) to determine maintenance capability to meet
   operational requirements.
      3.6.1.1. Long-range maintenance plans will be developed in as much detail as possible.
      All maintenance requirements will be consolidated into a single long-range plan using AF
      Form 2401, Equipment Utilization and Maintenance Schedule, or computer generated
      Form. As a minimum, the long-range plan shows the current month and the next 2
      months’ known flying and maintenance requirements. Known maintenance requirements
      are defined as any maintenance event that impacts aircraft availability and maintenance
      events requiring management attention to ensure smooth flow of scheduling/completion.
      Maintenance events should be consolidated during a single down period to the
      greatest extent possible. As a minimum, include calendar inspections that prevent
      operational utilization for that day(s) flying schedule, calendar time change items,
      TCTOs in workable status, PDM schedules, training aircraft, cannibalization aircraft, and
      aircraft ISO/PE/Phase inspections. Specific locally developed codes will be used to
      identify each different special inspection, TCI, and TCTO on the AF Form 2401. Other
      maintenance requirements, such as engine changes, hourly requirements, inspections,
      training aircraft and cannibalization aircraft will be posted as they become known or
      planned. Add Alternate Mission Equipment (AME) inspections to the long-range plan if
      the aircraft is scheduled to stay in that configuration to ensure the inspections are
      included in the monthly and weekly schedules. Refine monthly and weekly schedules to
      ensure the quarterly plan objectives are met.
      3.6.1.2. (Added-36WG) Local codes for special inspections, TCIs, and TCTOs, will not
      be developed for use on AF Form 2401. Deployed units will maintain and use codes
      developed at home station for this purpose.
   3.6.2. The OS operations officers and AMU OIC/NCOIC will review their applicable
   portion of the monthly and weekly schedule prior to submission to MOF PS&D. To optimize
   aircraft and munitions support, MXS, AMXS and OS commanders will ensure the number of
   aircraft committed to the schedule and/or munitions configurations are minimized and
   standardized. Use the following sequence of actions to ensure monthly planning results in a
   contracted flying schedule. The monthly planning process is as follows:
      3.6.2.1. NLT the first weekly OG/MXG scheduling meeting of the month, the OPS
      officer provides AMU OIC/NCOIC, MUNS Control/Munitions officer and AMU PS&D
      with the estimated operational needs for the following month in as much detail as
      possible. Include known take-off times, landing times, the flying hour window and
20                                 ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012


      munitions configurations. If the take-off and landing times are unknown, block turn
      patterns are required.
      3.6.2.2. NLT the second weekly OG/MXG scheduling meeting of the month, the AMU
      OIC/ NCOIC tells the OPS officer whether requirements can be met or limitations exist
      which may prevent successful fulfillment of requirements. MUNS control NCOIC/
      Munitions officer tells the OPS officer whether munitions requirements can be met or
      limitations exist. Make adjustments to the proposed monthly flying and maintenance plan
      to satisfy maintenance and operational requirements.
      3.6.2.3. NLT the third weekly OG/MXG scheduling meeting of the month, operations
      and maintenance formalize next month’s plan prior to presenting it to the WG/CC for
      approval.
  3.6.3. During the monthly meeting, OS scheduling outlines past accomplishments, status of
  flying goals, problems encountered, and detailed needs for the next month.
      3.6.3.1. AMU/AMXS outline projected maintenance capability, and aircraft/equipment
      availability. MUNS control NCOIC/Munitions officer outlines projected munitions
      supportability.
      3.6.3.2. Operational requirements and maintenance capability scheduling conflicts that
      are not solvable by planned alternatives will be arbitrated by the group and wing
      commanders to decide what portion of the schedule will be executed.
  3.6.4. When the proposed monthly flying schedule contract is agreed upon and approved by
  the WG/ CC, it is included as a portion of the monthly flying and maintenance schedule. The
  monthly flying and maintenance schedule is published/distributed NLT 5 duty days prior to
  the beginning of the effective month. All agencies will submit their monthly plan inputs to
  MOF PS&D before presentation to the WG/CC.
  3.6.5. The sortie/flying hour contract specifies the number of sorties and hours required to be
  flown. The contract is the final resolved product between operational requirements and
  maintenance capabilities. The total forecasted attrition factor will be considered and added to
  the required sorties to ensure fulfillment of the contract. The annual required sorties for the
  month, plus the historical attrition factor (note paragraph 8.1: MXG approved revised
  attrition is also permitted), is the basis for the development of the monthly flying and
  maintenance schedules. Attrition sorties are not substitutes for capability shortfalls; they are
  figured against the contract. The monthly flying schedule will reflect the number of sorties
  contracted, the number of attrition sorties added, and the number of sorties scheduled for
  each unit.
NOTE: The calendar in Table 3.1. is an example month and represents when group and wing
level quarterly, monthly, and weekly scheduling meetings should be held. The calendar also
illustrates when maintenance and operations requirements must be met. Each unit may hold
scheduling meetings at times during the week/month convenient to the organization, as
long as the timelines in this instruction are met.
      3.6.5.1. (Added-36WG) Historic AAFB attrition will be applied during development of
      the 36 WG monthly schedule. Deployed operational requirements are based on OPLAN
      readiness, directed Higher Headquarters (HHQ) taskings, exercise operations, and
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                  21


     aircrew training needs. Aircraft and maintenance support for operational requirements
     are provided for these taskings.
  3.6.6. Included in the monthly flying and maintenance schedule are:
     3.6.6.1. A detailed monthly operations utilization calendar which specifies total aircraft
     flying hours, total sorties and missions, alert requirements, and scheduled sortie or
     mission requirements, daily turn plans for each MDS by squadron, group, or wing.
     3.6.6.2. Maintenance workload requirements.
     3.6.6.3. Transient work schedule, if applicable.
         3.6.6.3.1. (Added-36WG) Transient work schedule is routinely unknown and will
         not be included in any supplement.
     3.6.6.4. Aircraft scheduled inspections, deployments, TCTOs, engine changes, time
     changes, contract or depot maintenance, washes, corrosion control, training aircraft, and
     alert commitments. The letter "F" (F2, F3, etc…) may be printed on the AF Form 2401 or
     automated product to reflect the number of sorties each aircraft is scheduled to fly and to
     facilitate TDI/Phase management. As a minimum, automated Forms must reflect all
     required entries and standardized for each MDS.
     3.6.6.5. Support equipment (SE) scheduled inspections, contract or depot maintenance,
     TCTOs, time changes, washes, and corrosion control.
     3.6.6.6. Avionics and other off-equipment maintenance to include scheduled inspections,
     TCTOs, assembly or repair operations.
     3.6.6.7. Engine in-shop inspections and maintenance needs.
     3.6.6.8. Munitions, photo, electronic countermeasures and other mission loading or
     configuration requirements, including ammunition changes.
     3.6.6.9. Total ordnance requirements for aircraft support listed by quantity and type.
     Include the following statement in the schedule for units with munitions: "The types and
     quantities of munitions listed in this schedule, plus previous expenditures, do not exceed
     AFI 36-2217, Munitions Requirements for Aircrew Training, authorized allowances."
     3.6.6.10. Tanks, racks, adapters, and pylons and war reserve materiel scheduled
     inspections, TCTOs, assembly, or repair operations.
     3.6.6.11. Quality Assurance (QA) scheduled inspections listed by type and quantity
     unless published separately by QA.
     3.6.6.12. If known as confirmed requirements, include special activities, such as
     commander's calls, group TDYs, unit physical training program and other unit
     formations.
     3.6.6.13. Monthly training schedules, if not published separately.
     3.6.6.14. Detailed support requirements, as applicable, including:
         3.6.6.14.1. Petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) servicing.
         3.6.6.14.2. Supply requirements.

  NOTE: The calendar above is an example month and represents when group and wing level
  quarterly, monthly, and weekly scheduling meetings should be conducted and when
  maintenance and operations requirements must be met. Each unit may hold scheduling
  meetings at times during the week/month convenient to the organization, as long as the
  timelines in this instruction are met.
3.7. Weekly Scheduling:
   3.7.1. Weekly scheduling is the final refinement to the monthly plan and results in the
   weekly flying and maintenance schedule. Its execution is measured by the procedures
   outlined in this instruction. The OS operations officer, AMU OIC/NCOIC, and AMXS
   Maintenance Operations review the proposed weekly flying and maintenance schedule with
   OS, AMXS, MXS and MUNS Control/Munitions officer prior to presenting it to the
   OG/MXG commanders. The group approved schedule will be submitted to the MOF PS&D
   for consolidation prior to submission to the wing commander. MOF PS&D reviews the
   schedules for adequate utilization of aircraft and proper scheduling of maintenance
   requirements. Weekly scheduling meetings will be conducted at the group and wing level as
   follows:
       3.7.1.1. The OG/CC and MXG/CC, or their designated representatives, will chair the
       group meeting to consolidate and review proposed flying and maintenance plans. The OG
       and MXG will review the past week's accomplishments, negotiate alternatives, and
       approve refinements to the coming week's schedule.
          3.7.1.1.1. (Added-36WG) The 36 MXG/CC and 36 OG/CC approved schedule will
          be submitted to 36 MOF/MXOOP for consolidation prior to submission to the 36
          WG/CC. All sections will standardize schedules using a Monday through Sunday
          format.
       3.7.1.2. The WG/CC will chair a weekly scheduling meeting at which the groups (OG
       and MXG) the MSG/CC will also attend this meeting, will present the flying and
       maintenance plan for approval. MOF PS&D ensures a completed (paper or electronic)
       copy is submitted to the WG/CC (or equivalent) at the weekly scheduling meeting.
          3.7.1.2.1. At the scheduling meeting, evaluate the past week’s accomplishments, to
          include Flying and Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness, and refinements to the
          coming week's schedule.
          3.7.1.2.2. (Added-36WG) Agencies that have inputs to the weekly schedule (36
          MOF/MXOOP, 36 MXG/QA, 36 MXS/MXWMSA, 506 EARS/OPS, HSC-25, 36
          OSS/OSX, 36 CRG/A35) must submit their inputs to 36 MOF/MXOOP NLT 1600
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                              25


         hours on Tuesday. On night flying weeks, the schedule can be turned in at 1800.
         Final revisions are due no later than three hours prior to the 21-165 weekly
         scheduling meeting.
          NOTE:        36 EAMXS AMU OIC will submit Operations and Maintenance
          scheduling inputs to the EAMXS/CC for approval before forwarding to the
          MXG/CC and OG/CC.
  3.7.2. NLT 2 duty days before the weekly scheduling meeting, the flying squadron
  operations officer gives the AMU OIC/NCOIC, AMU PS&D, EMS/CMS/MXS maintenance
  operations and MUNS Control/Munitions Officer the following information:
      3.7.2.1. Aircraft take-off and landing times.
      3.7.2.2. Configuration requirements.
      3.7.2.3. Munitions requirements by quantity and type.
      3.7.2.4. Fuel loads.
      3.7.2.5. Special or peculiar mission support requirements.
      3.7.2.6. Alert requirements.
      3.7.2.7. Exercise vulnerability.
      3.7.2.8. Deployments.
      3.7.2.9. Off base sorties.
      3.7.2.10. On-equipment training requirements.
      3.7.2.11. Other special requirements.
      3.7.2.12. Nuclear munitions maintenance schedule
NOTE: When one maintenance unit supports more than one flying unit at a base, the OS
operations officers will consolidate and de-conflict those requirements and submit a single
operational requirement to maintenance. This will ensure operational requirements do not
exceed aircraft availability and maintenance capability.
  3.7.3. Operations and maintenance schedulers discuss weekly needs and arrive at an
  acceptable, coordinated schedule for group commanders' review.
  3.7.4. OG/CC and MXG/CC present the proposed flying schedule to the WG/CC for
  approval. If an agreement cannot be reached before the weekly scheduling meeting, the
  problem is referred to the WG/CC for decision. Once approved and signed by the WG/CC,
  OG/CC, and MXG/CC, the flying schedule is the final planning guide for both operations
  and maintenance and is a contract and every effort will be made to execute the schedule as
  printed.
  3.7.5. MOF PS&D ensures distribution of the schedule to each appropriate activity and
  workcenter NLT 1200L Friday morning. Units conducting night flying operations should
  distribute the schedule as soon as possible but NLT 1400L Friday. Automated methods are
  acceptable (ensure security requirements are met). Once printed in the weekly flying and
  maintenance schedule, the aircraft or equipment is made available to meet that schedule.
26                                  ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012


  MOF PS&D records maintenance scheduling deviations and forwards computations to
  MDSA weekly for publication in the monthly maintenance summary as outlined in Chapter
  5. The maintenance operations center (MOC) reports flying scheduling deviations.
  3.7.6. Units publish a weekly schedule for normal home base operations, deployments, (to
  include a printed schedule at the deployed locations, weapons training or detached site), and
  planned sortie surges. Units operating by daily ATOs will publish a schedule IAW
  paragraph 3.7 and filed as a weekly schedule after execution. Included in the weekly flying
  and maintenance schedule are:
      3.7.6.1. Sortie sequence numbers, aircraft tail numbers (primary and spares), scheduled
      take-off and landing times, aircraft or equipment scheduled use times, configurations,
      fuel loads and special equipment requirements. NOTE: Units will publish landing times.
      3.7.6.2. Spare aircraft requirements are based on projected aircraft first sortie logistics
      losses. Spare requirements are computed and printed by day for each unit in the weekly
      flying and maintenance schedule. See Chapter 8 for factors used to determine spares.
      3.7.6.3. Scheduled maintenance actions by aircraft and equipment serial number to
      include inspections, TCTOs, time changes, contract and depot inputs, engine changes,
      washes or corrosion control, documents review, deferred discrepancies and hours
      remaining to phase/ISO. A job control number/event ID will be printed in the weekly
      flying schedule for each scheduled maintenance event.
      3.7.6.4. Required pre-inspection and other maintenance meeting schedules to include
      minimum attendees.
      3.7.6.5. Wash facility use.
      3.7.6.6. Training requirements plus aircraft and equipment in support of these
      requirements.
      3.7.6.7. Aerospace Ground Equipment inspection/maintenance schedule by type, serial
      number or identification.
      3.7.6.8. Include the following statement in the schedule for units with munitions: "The
      types and quantities of munitions listed in this schedule, plus previous expenditures, do
      not exceed AFI 36-2217 authorized allowances." This statement eliminates the need for
      submitting certificates of authorization when ordering munitions to support the flying
      schedule.
      3.7.6.9. A list of new or revised publications, T.O. indexes, inspection work cards,
      checklists and -6 codebooks, including release/change dates. Automated systems will be
      used, if available.
NOTE: The AF Form 2402, Weekly Equipment Utilization and Maintenance Schedule, is used
as a summary of the week. The AF Form 2403, Weekly Aircraft Utilization/ Maintenance
Schedule, is more finite in the depiction of aircraft utilization and maintenance. Electronic
versions of the above forms are authorized. Whatever forms are used, all requirements must be
entered. Weekly schedules may be published electronically provided local security
requirements are met.
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                 27


3.8. Changes to the Weekly Schedule:
   3.8.1. Types :
      3.8.1.1. Para Change - Pen-and-Ink. The pen-and-ink AF Form 2407 is not intended
      to be used as a tool to extend the scheduling process by another day. Pen-and-ink
      changes made to next week’s schedule, submitted to the MOC by 1600 hours Friday or at
      the daily maintenance scheduling/production meeting, whichever occurs first are
      authorized (EXCEPTION: NLT 2 hours after the last landing during printed wing night
      flying weeks). They are non-reportable and become part of the printed weekly flying
      schedule. An AF Form 2407 is required stating the changes are pen-and-ink. NOTE: The
      intent of the pen-and-ink AF Form 2407 is to correct minor errors and not complete
      revisions of the previously Wing/CC approved schedule.
          3.8.1.1.1. Unit Training Assembly (UTA) Weekends. During scheduled UTA
          Weekend flying for classic Association units are allowed to accomplish pen-and-inks
          on the last scheduled fly-day (Saturday or Sunday). Approved pen-and-ink changes
          will be made to next week’s schedule prior to 1600 hours local or 2 hours after the
          last landing during scheduled/published night flying.
          3.8.1.1.2. (Added-36WG) Operations and maintenance pen-and-ink change requests
          submitted prior to 1600L on Friday or the last duty day on the flying week will be
          coordinated     through    36    MOF/MXOOP         for   distribution  after    all
          notifications/approvals have been accomplished.
      3.8.1.2. Approved pen-and ink changes are non-reportable and become part of the
      printed weekly flying and maintenance schedule. An AF Form 2407 or electronic
      substitution is required stating the changes are pen-and-ink.
      3.8.1.3. Tail Number Swaps. Tail number swaps should be used to prevent
      reconfigurations and unnecessary expenditures of work hours when the primary aircraft is
      not mission-capable by its scheduled take-off time. Every effort is made to make the
      aircraft tail number swaps at the daily maintenance production meeting the day prior to
      the aircraft scheduled flight and entered on the AF Form 2407. All tail number swaps
      made at the daily maintenance production meeting are entered on an AF Form 2407 for
      audit and analysis purposes.
      3.8.1.4. Configuration. Configurations will be finalized at the daily maintenance
      production meeting and documented on an AF Form 2407. To prevent excessive
      expenditures of work hours, configuration changes made after the daily maintenance
      production meeting and prior to the first crew ready time the next day, require an AF
      Form 2407 coordinated through the required agencies.
   3.8.2. Procedures. The initiator of AF Form 2407 will include the specific reason for each
   change. Any change to the printed schedule will require an AF Form 2407 with the following
   exceptions:
    A change to the original printed take-off or landing time of 15 minutes or less.
    A change of aircrew names, ranges, or airspace.
    Any change arising after the first crew ready time for the affected AMU for that day unless
    adding aircraft or sorties, or expanding the flying window.
28                                ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012


     3.8.2.1. Changes made during the daily maintenance production meeting also require an
     AF Form 2407. The agency requesting the change initiates the AF Form 2407 and
     coordinates it through the affected production superintendent, AMU OIC/NCOIC,
     AMXS maintenance operations, operations squadron operations officer, operations
     group, Munitions Control, maintenance group, and wing staff agencies, as applicable (i.e.
     MOC, PS&D, etc..). Coordinate changes affecting munitions requirements with
     Munitions Control to ensure proposed munitions changes can be met. The requested
     changes should be coordinated prior to the daily maintenance production meeting to
     allow sufficient time to determine supportability of the change.
     3.8.2.2. Changes arising after the first crew ready time for the remainder of the flying
     day, such as tail number swaps, do not require an AF Form 2407; however, these changes
     will be coordinated by telephone or radio with all affected agencies. EXCEPTION: Any
     aircraft, sortie added to the flying schedule and any sortie duration changes that
     extends flying or landing beyond the flying hour window will be coordinated using
     an AF Form 2407.
        3.8.2.2.1. (Added-36WG) MXG/CC and OG/CC will have final approval authority
        for all changes that result in reportable deviations as identified by the parent
        instruction. Due diligence will be applied when coordinating AF Form 2407 changes
        to ensure affected agencies are contacted. For example, an AF Form 2407 change
        that includes changes to fuel load will have the name of the POL controller that was
        contacted identified on the AF Form 2407 along with the time of notification. The
        POL contact info may say INFO only if the change did not drive a fuel load change.
        NOTE All changes affecting munitions (including load count, configurations for
        loaded munitions, delivery locations, etc.) will be coordinated through MUNS
        Munitions Operations Officer (MOO), MUNS Chief, or designated representative(s).
        Representatives(s) will be designated in writing by the MOO. This rule applies even
        after first crew show of the duty day. 36 MOF/MXOOP is the POC for the 36th
        Wing standardized 2407 template.

     3.8.2.3. After coordination, a copy of the AF Form 2407 is filed in the MOC. The MOC
     will ensure MDSA receives all AF Form 2407s for deviation accounting. AF Forms 2407
     will be disposed of IAW RDS.
        3.8.2.3.1. (Added-36WG) Upon receipt of a completely coordinated AF Form 2407
        change, MOC will ensure all affected agencies are notified via email. Phone and
        radio are acceptable avenues for notification for time sensitive changes to accompany
        email notifications.
        NOTE: MOC will email all 2407 changes (including Pen & Ink changes) to the
        MUNS Munitions control inbox.

     3.8.2.4. MOF PS&D will input all pen-and-ink changes in IMDS operational events
     subsystem using procedures in AFCSM 21-565V2, Operational Event Subsystem. After
     the Friday daily maintenance production meeting, MOC will input all changes (non-pen-
     and-ink). Maintenance Debrief will input utilization data for all sorties considered "flown
     as scheduled" (i.e. FCF/OCF, X/C returns, surge second and subsequent goes). Any AF
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                29


      Form 2407 coordinated changes made after pen-and-inks have been made and posted to
      IMDS by MOF PS&D will be input by MOC into the Maintenance Information System
      (MIS).
 NOTE: Use of the AF Form 2407 does not negate the recording of deviations.
   3.8.3. AF Form 2407 Approval Authority. All AF Form 2407 changes that add aircraft
   and/or sorties or increase the flying window require both OG and MXG commander (or
   group level representative, designated in writing by group commander) approval. All other
   AF Form 2407 changes will be approved by the affected squadron commander(s) (or
   designated representative). The MOC will coordinate higher headquarters directed taskings
   that require immediate execution. Electronic coordination is acceptable provided receipt is
   acknowledged and the sender enters the name of the person notified and the date/time on the
   AF Form 2407.
      3.8.3.1. Pen-and-ink AF Form 2407 also require OG and MXG approval. The group
      approved pen-and-ink AF Form 2407 is required because pen-and-ink AF Form 2407
      change the schedule/ contract signed at the weekly scheduling meeting and becomes the
      new basis for deviation recording.
      3.8.3.2. (Added-36WG) AF           Form       2407       change request involving
      fuel/weapons/chaff/flare require both EBS/CC and EAMXS/CC’s approval (or a
      designated in writing representative to sign on their behalf).
3.9. (Added-36WG) The following guidelines have been established to streamline
scheduling practices in the 36 WG:
   3.9.1. (Added-36WG) Turn-times. Turn-time is defined as the amount of time between
   scheduled landing and scheduled takeoff time. The following paragraphs provide guidelines
   forming the basis for negotiation between EBS and 36 EAMXS. Actual turn-times will be
   based on mission requirements and maintenance capability.
   3.9.2. (Added-36WG) B-52H Minimum Turn Time (from Landing to Takeoff):
      3.9.2.1. (Added-36WG) Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC) Sortie = 1.5 hours.
      3.9.2.2. (Added-36WG) Quick turn (QT) Sortie = 4 hours (Chute packing and fuel load
      up to 50K lbs).
      3.9.2.3. (Added-36WG) Recovery time between fly days = 12 hours.
      NOTE: If weapons are required after QT a standard planning factor will be 5 minutes for
      every weapon loaded. Ops will strive to eliminate loading weapons on a QT to the
      maximum extent possible.

   3.9.3. (Added-36WG) Flying window.
      3.9.3.1. (Added-36WG) The 36 WG normal scheduled flying window is 0800 to 2000,
      but may be extended with approval of the 36 MXG/CC and 36 OG/CC.
30                          ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012


     3.9.3.1.1. (Added-36WG) The flying window is defined from the first scheduled
     local takeoff or landing to the last scheduled local takeoff or landing. DAY/NIGHT
     schedules will adhere to a maximum 18 hour flying window, unless otherwise
     approved by 36 MXG/CC and 36 OG/CC.
     NOTE: On Friday’s the EBS and EAMXS should plan for all aircraft to be recovered
     no later than 1600L.
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                    31


                                           Chapter 4

                        FLYING SCHEDULING EFFECTIVENESS

4.1. Purpose. This chapter defines flying schedule deviations and provides formulas for
computing FSE. FSE is a tool to identify those processes within the wing’s control that can be
improved to help drive down turbulence for both the operator and maintainer.
   4.1.1. A cornerstone of successful flying scheduling and execution is an understanding of
   how the schedule is executed versus how it was planned to be executed. These differences in
   scheduled versus actual events are only recorded in the execution phase of the scheduling
   process and are called deviations. Deviation data must be recorded so that follow-up analysis
   can identify the appropriate corrective actions if any are needed. Without deviation data, this
   analysis is impossible. Deviation data recording and analysis is the beginning of the process
   that will in the end, improve unit's flying operations. The unit is responsible for documenting
   deviations to the weekly flying and maintenance schedule and determining the cause for each
   deviation. Deviations must be coordinated with the appropriate squadron/AMU before being
   assigned to a specific category. Schedule deviations that result from a sequence of events will
   be assigned a primary cause. A determination of the primary cause will be made by the
   parties involved to arrive at a unit position. The OS operations officer and the AMU
   OIC/AMXS maintenance operations, along with MOF maintenance operations, will monitor
   deviations to ensure they meet the criteria in this publication. When conflicts arise,
   leadership of involved units will resolve them at the lowest level. All deviations will be
   recorded as described in this publication.
   4.1.2. Flying Scheduling Effectiveness (FSE). This leading indicator is a measure of how
   well the unit planned and executed the weekly flying schedule. The flying scheduled
   developed by tail number is the baseline upon which the FSE is derived by comparing each
   day’s deviations. Deviations that decrease the FSE from 100% include: Scheduled sorties not
   flown because of maintenance, supply, operations adds, deletes, and ground aborts;
   scheduled sorties that take-off more than 30 minutes prior to scheduled take-off; scheduled
   sorties that take-off more than 15 minutes after their scheduled take-off time. Disruptions to
   the flying schedule can cause turmoil on the flightline, send a ripple effect throughout other
   agencies, and adversely impact scheduled maintenance actions. [Adjusted Sorties Scheduled
   = Total Sorties Scheduled - Sorties Cancelled for Monthly/Yearly Utilization Rate
   Achievement + Sorties Added for End of Fiscal Year UTE Close Out]. Reference ACCI 21-
   118, Logistics Maintenance Performance Indicator Reporting Procedures, for FSE
   computations.
4.2. Requirements. Flying scheduling effectiveness computation and deviation recording are
required for all CAF assigned aircraft. Reporting procedures are contained in Chapter 7 of this
publication.
4.3. Flying Schedule Deviations.
   4.3.1. Schedule deviations apply to the printed weekly flying and maintenance schedule,
   even though a coordinated change is accomplished using an AF Form 2407. When a unit
   coordinates a change to the printed weekly flying schedule, using an AF Form 2407, the unit
   is informing everyone of the changed information and deviations will be recorded as
32                                 ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012


  appropriate. Multiple deviations against a single line entry will not count towards FSE
  except for (a) additions that air or ground abort, (b) additions that cancel, (c) added
  aircraft/sorties that take-off late, and (d) late take-offs that air abort. The AFTO Form
  781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, is the official source document for take-
  off and landing data. For all deviations, the person recording the deviations in IMDS will
  provide a detailed explanation in the remarks section and a Job Control Number/Event ID in
  IMDS screen 350 for all maintenance CX, GAA, GAB, GAC, AA, AI, and FE. Flying
  schedule deviations fall into one of the following categories (See Table 4.1 for common
  deviations):
  4.3.2. Ground Deviations. Ground deviations are events occurring before aircraft take-off.
  All ground deviations are recorded in IMDS and used in flying scheduling effectiveness
  calculations unless otherwise noted. Specific ground deviations are:
     4.3.2.1. Addition (AD). A sortie or aircraft added to the schedule not previously printed
     on the weekly schedule, will be recorded against the agency (OP, MX, HQ) requesting
     the additional sortie or aircraft. Sorties added to the schedule will be used in Total Sorties
     Scheduled for Flying Scheduling Effectiveness computation. Aircraft added to the
     schedule will not be used as a part of the Total Sorties Scheduled for Flying Scheduling
     Effectiveness computation; however, aircraft adds (i.e. added spares) will be captured in
     the FSE Calculated-Deviations computation.
         4.3.2.1.1. Functional Check Flights (FCF) and Operational Check Flights (OCF)
         whose primary purpose is to perform maintenance checks are not addition deviations
         but will be coordinated using AF Form 2407. FCF/OCF sorties and sorties originating
         off-station without home-unit support will be considered "flown as scheduled”
         without recording deviations. FCF “chase” aircraft, when accompanying FCF/OCF
         training or checkout sortie for single seat MDS only (i.e. A-10) will be considered
         “flown as scheduled” without recording deviations. The FCF “chase” is for FCF
         qualified operator to conduct and/or evaluate training/checkout only.
NOTE: All additions will be coordinated using the AF Form 2407 and approved IAW
paragraph 3.8.3.
     4.3.2.2. Cancellation (CX). An aircraft or sortie removed from the printed schedule for
     any reason prior to crew show. For hard line sorties (sorties supporting other defense
     customers), cancellations occur when it is determined the originally scheduled
     mission cannot be met. For training sorties, if the sortie can launch and recover during
     the squadron’s flying window and perform its original mission, a cancellation is not
     recorded. If any sortie does not launch within the late take-off criteria, a late take-off is
     recorded.
     4.3.2.3. Early Take-off (ET). An early take-off is a scheduled sortie launching more than
     30 minutes prior to the published take-off time. EXCEPTION: Do not record early take-
     off deviations for hot pit turn sorties.
     4.3.2.4. Late Take-off (LT). A late take-off occurs when a scheduled sortie becomes
     airborne more than 15 minutes after the scheduled take-off time. If the printed tail
     number is a ground abort and is replaced with a spare that takes off late, only the late
     take-off is computed in FSE. Another example is if an aircraft landed late, after the
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                     33


      published landing time, and subsequently takes off late due to insufficient time to turn the
      aircraft, the late take-off deviation is recorded to the original cause for the late landing,
      such as, operations. Commanders must consider the impact when a sortie takes off late
      and the aircraft is scheduled to turn to another sortie that day. It may be best to shorten
      the sortie duration after a late take-off and land at the scheduled landing time, rather than
      fly the scheduled duration, due to a higher priority mission later in the day.
          4.3.2.4.1. EXCEPTION: RQ-4, U-2, C-130 series, C-135 series, E-3, E-4, E-8, B-1,
          B-2, and B-52 weapon systems will use 30 minutes for late take-off.
      4.3.2.5. Spare (SP). A spare is a designated aircraft on the printed schedule to be used in
      case a scheduled primary aircraft cannot fly its scheduled sortie. Spare aircraft can also
      include aircraft that are scheduled to fly in sorties later in the day, have aborted from an
      earlier sortie, have flown earlier or released after FCF/OCF. Do not count printed spares
      flown in scheduled lines as deviations when computing FSE.
      4.3.2.6. Tail Number Swap (TS). Tail swaps are changes to the printed flying schedule
      involving aircraft tail numbers printed on that day's schedule. Tail swaps may be made up
      to crew show time. Tail swaps made after crew show are recorded as spare. The MOC
      must be notified of all tail swaps and record all tail swaps in IMDS. Do not count Tail
      Number Swaps as deviations when computing FSE. Below are specific examples of tail
      swaps:
          4.3.2.6.1. Changing aircraft in printed line numbers with printed spare aircraft.
          4.3.2.6.2. Changing aircraft in printed line numbers to different printed line numbers.
          4.3.2.6.3. Changing aircraft in printed line numbers to any previously flown aircraft.
          For example, tail swaps are allowed for aircraft after release from OCF/FCF or XC
          return aircraft.
  4.3.3. Air Deviations. Air deviations are events occurring after take-off. They are recorded
  in IMDS but are not included in FSE calculations. Ground deviations take precedence over
  air deviations when only one deviation can be loaded in IMDS. Air deviations fall into the
  following categories:
      4.3.3.1. Air Abort (AA). An air abort is an aircraft/sortie that cannot complete its mission
      for any reason. Air aborts are considered a sortie flown against the flying hour program
      when reporting total sorties flown, but may not be considered a successful sortie based on
      mission effectiveness by operations to meet RAP/training/contingency requirements. Air
      aborts will be coded to the agency or condition that caused the aborted mission.
NOTE: Effective mission decisions will be made by operations; however, a non-effective
mission decision by operations does not necessarily mean an air abort occurred as defined in
ACCI 21-118. For example, if one planned mission task out of a planned five tasks is not
completed or operations flies an alternate mission (adversary, drone, etc..) and does not return
the aircraft immediately to maintenance, the sortie should not be coded as an air abort if
operations later determines, based on the original mission profile, the sortie was non-effective.
The Air Abort rate is used as a maintenance reliability indicator and as a measure of re-work
(sorties reflown).

     4.3.3.2. Air Abort, IFE (AI). An air aborted aircraft/sortie with a situation resulting in an
     in-flight emergency declared by the aircrew.
     4.3.3.3. Early Landing (EL). An early landing is an aircraft/sortie landing more than 30
     minutes before the scheduled landing time. Early Landing deviations are not used when
     computing FSE.
     4.3.3.4. IFE (FE). An aircraft/sortie with a situation resulting in an in-flight emergency
     declared by the aircrew after the mission is accomplished.
     4.3.3.5. Late Landing (LL). A late landing is an aircraft/sortie landing more than 15
     minutes after the scheduled landing time. If the sortie originated on time, record any
     subsequent late take-off or cancellation against the agency that caused the late landing. If
     the extended sortie did not originate on time, record any subsequent sortie deviation
     against the agency that caused the original delay. Late landings are not included in FSE
     calculations.
  4.3.4. Ground Aborts. A ground abort by itself is not a deviation from the flying schedule,
  but can cause a deviation such as lost sortie or late take-off. A ground abort is an event after
  crew show time preventing a “crew ready” aircraft from becoming airborne. Ground aborts
  will be recorded to the responsible agency or condition that caused the aircraft to abort.
  Ground aborts are categorized as GAA, GAB, GAC, operations, HHQ, weather, sympathy,
  other, etc. For maintenance ground aborts do not use cause code MTx, only use GAA, GAB,
  or GAC. For example, if an aircraft ground aborts and the sortie is not replaced by a spare,
  the lost sortie is a deviation towards FSE. Ground aborts on FCFs or OCFs will be recorded
  in IMDS, but not used when computing FSE.
     4.3.4.1. If a ground aborted aircraft is replaced by a spare, and the spare can meet the
     mission requirements, the original aircraft will be coded as a “spare ground abort.”
     NOTE: This is not used in computing FSE.
     4.3.4.2. If the original aborted aircraft is launched on the original scheduled mission, but
     exceeds the 15-minute late take-off criteria, the sortie will be recorded as a late take-off.
     4.3.4.3. If the aircraft lands, takes fuel via the hot pits, incurs an NMC condition after
     completion of hot pit refueling (receptacle disconnected) and can no longer continue, a
     ground abort is recorded.
     4.3.4.4. If an aircraft ground aborts and is replaced by a spare and the spare ground
     aborts causing the sortie not to be flown, both ground aborts will be counted in the
     overall ground abort rate, the lost sortie will be considered cancelled and included as the
     deviation in FSE. The first ground abort would not be used in computing FSE.

4.4. Deviation Causes. Deviations will be assigned a primary cause. See guidance in
paragraph 4.1.1 to resolve questions concerning assigning deviations between maintenance and
operations. Deviations will be assigned one of the following causes:
   4.4.1. Maintenance (MT_). Deviations resulting from aircraft discrepancies, unscheduled
   maintenance, or for actions taken for maintenance consideration.
   4.4.2. Operations (OP_). Deviations resulting from operations/aircrew actions, mission
   changes causing an early/late take-off, or cancellation including substitution/aircrew illness
   (including short notice aircrew physical/mental disqualification), and over-stressing the
   aircraft. OP_ are also deviations resulting from unit controlled operations factors including
   those caused by mission/load planning, life support, intelligence, base operations, range
   scheduling, and passengers.
   4.4.3. Supply (SU_). Deviations resulting from a Partially Mission Capable Supply or Not
   Mission Capable Supply condition or for late Supply or POL delivery. See AFMAN 23-110,
   USAF Supply Manual.
 NOTE: The actual time required for installation will be considered.
   4.4.4. Higher Headquarters (HHQ). Deviations resulting from a higher headquarters tasking
   including closing of low level routes/ranges or external customer driven mission change.
   When an aircraft that was scheduled for a higher headquarters directed alert or off-base
   mission is replaced by a spare refer to paragraph 6.5 for unit options.
   4.4.5. Weather (WX). Deviations resulting from weather conditions such as sorties canceled
   because of severe weather conditions. For example, if an aircraft taxied to the end of runway
   and the wing commander cancels all flying due to weather, the deviation is a weather abort.
   Sorties/Aircraft cancelled prior to crew show are weather cancels.
   4.4.6. Sympathy (SY). Deviations occurring when a flight of two or more aircraft, under the
   command of a flight leader or instructor pilot are canceled, aborted, or late due to a
   cancellation, abort, or delay of one of the aircraft in the flight or a supporting flight. Flights
   engaged in Dissimilar Air Combat Tactics training that are delayed by the other flight will
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                    39


   record the delay as sympathy. Sorties, which are to replace sympathy aborts or cancellations
   on the same day, will be recorded as sympathy additions. Sorties lost caused by the aircraft's
   scheduled mated tanker/receiver/mission event will be recorded as sympathy. Examples of
   mission events are: loss of release times, tanker support, Minimum Interval Take-Off causing
   take-off delay or cancellation, deviations caused by another unit’s or command’s support
   should be coded as SY deviations.
NOTE: Deviations caused by aircraft/missions earlier scheduled lines will be assigned to the
cause of the earlier deviation, not SY.
   4.4.7. Air Traffic Control (AT). Deviations resulting from air traffic control problems (for
   example, flight clearance delays, tower communication failure, conflicting air traffic, runway
   change, or runway closure).
   4.4.8. Other (OT). Deviations resulting from unusual circumstances not covered by other
   causes listed. OT may include:
      4.4.8.1. Malfunctions, failures, or necessary adjustments to equipment undergoing tests
      or evaluations associated with Operational Testing and Evaluation (OT&E),
      Development Testing and Evaluation (DT&E), or Initial Operational Testing and
      Evaluation (IOT&E).
      4.4.8.2. Unusual circumstances such as bird strikes, damage during air refueling, and
      unscheduled alert swap out.
      4.4.8.3. Equipment, non-CAF. Deviations caused by National Airborne Operations
      Center or Air Intelligence Agency or Air Force Material Command equipment, and other
      non-CAF support and equipment.
   4.4.9. Utilization Day (UTE). Commander's authorized management deletions IAW
   paragraph 4.5.3.
   4.4.10. Exercise, Higher Headquarters (XEH). Deviations resulting from higher headquarters
   directed exercises, including alarm/force protection conditions.
   4.4.11. Exercise, Local (XEL). Deviations resulting from wing/unit directed exercises,
   including alarm/force protection conditions.
   4.4.12. (Added-36WG) Weekly deviation accountability will be determined by the
   Production Supervisor in coordination with the Operations Supervisor. Any dispute or
   disagreement that cannot be agreed upon will be discussed between the AMU OIC and the
   EBS/DO, then the EAMXS/CC and EBS/CC, the MXG/CD and OG/CD and finally the
   MXG/CC and OG/CC.
    NOTE: Accountability will be properly assigned prior to being presented to the 36 WG/CC
    or designated representative, during the daily 1500 Standup meeting.
4.5. Scheduling Exceptions:
   4.5.1. Limited Number of Possessed Aircraft. AMUs with 11 or fewer possessed aircraft
   of a particular MDS, or 50% of their possessed aircraft deployed, are authorized to schedule
   tail numbers daily. Units may consider alert/IR aircraft and aircraft in possession code PJ or
   PR as non-possessed when applying the 11 or less rules. Units will print aircraft tail numbers
   in the weekly schedule. Aircraft tail numbers may be changed at the daily maintenance
40                                ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012


  production meeting using AF Form 2407 without recording deviations (sorties added or
  canceled are chargeable). Immediately following the daily maintenance production
  meeting, the selected aircraft tail numbers for the next day’s flying schedule will be entered
  in IMDS. Once tail numbers are selected at the daily maintenance production meeting,
  normal deviations will be recorded. Although aircraft tail numbers may be changed at the
  daily meeting, maintenance and flying scheduling effectiveness is measured against the
  printed weekly schedule. Aircraft tail number changes will be chargeable against FSE
  after tail numbers are confirmed during the daily maintenance production meeting.
NOTE: No additional sorties may be added under this scheduling option without addition
deviation rules being applied as applicable in paragraph 4.3.2.1.
  4.5.2. Adverse Weather. Units may add sorties to the flying schedule to make up for
  weather losses. Sorties will only be added to the schedule when the planned weather attrition
  for the month, prorated daily, has been exceeded for that month. The number of sorties added
  will not exceed the difference between the planned weather attrition and actual weather
  losses. Sorties added for weather that do not exceed prorated weather attrition, are not
  included in OP-MT-FES-Rate. (EXAMPLE: Planned weather attrition for the month equals
  30 sorties. On the 10th O&M day of the month (of 20) a unit’s weather losses are already 30
  sorties. The unit may add 15 sorties (weather “adds”). The maintenance schedule and the
  ability of maintenance to support the additional requirements must be carefully considered
  before adding sorties. Under no circumstances will the number of sorties added for weather
  exceed the difference between actual weather losses and the prorated expected weather losses
  for the month. See Chapter 8 for example of computing weather attrition for the flying
  schedule.)
  4.5.3. Achievement of Utilization (UTE) Rate. Utilization management is accomplished
  throughout the month. Attrition should be closely monitored and a determination to adjust the
  number of sorties required should be made before each weekly schedule is developed. This
  practice ensures an even sortie flow, eliminates excessive maintenance actions and limits the
  number of sorties canceled. The operations group commander is responsible for the flying
  program and, in coordination with the maintenance group commander, can add or cancel
  sorties anytime during the month. However, flying scheduling effectiveness will be recorded
  when changing the weekly schedule. The operations group commander, in coordination with
  MXG/CC and MSG/CC, is encouraged to modify or cancel all or part of the schedule when
  they are reasonably assured the UTE rate goal for the month will be met. Sorties may be
  cancelled for UTE management during the last five O&M days of the month and will be
  recorded as "UTE." Sorties cancelled for UTE are not included in FSE. See AFI 11-103,
  Aircraft Standard Utilization Rate Procedures, and AFI 11-102 ACCSUP for UTE rate
  development policy.
      4.5.3.1. (Added-36WG) Does not apply (see paragraph 3.1.3)
  4.5.4. Achievement of Student Training Goals (TF coded and Flying Training Units
  only). The squadron commander may, when an OS has achieved its monthly training goal,
  adjust the weekly printed flying schedule. Mission take-off times, configurations, etc., may
  be changed without incurring deviations. All changes will be made at the daily maintenance
  production meeting and will be documented on an AF Form 2407. Once the schedule has
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                    41


   been changed, normal deviation reporting applies. This option allows units the flexibility to
   maximize use of those sorties originally scheduled for student training.
   4.5.5. Year End Closeout. During the last 15 O&M days of the fiscal year, units are
   permitted to selectively add/cancel scheduled sorties to manage the end-of-year flying hour
   closeout. These additions/cancellations will be recorded as "UTE." This provision is intended
   to help units gradually close out end-of-year flying without creating hangar queen aircraft
   and unintentionally exceeding the UTE rate. Sorties cancelled for UTE are not included in
   FSE. However, sorties requiring munitions support should be evenly distributed throughout
   the fiscal year to preclude a high demand for munitions support during the month of
   September. IAW AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management, semi-
   annual inventories must be started and finished in the months of March and September.
4.6. Combat Sortie Generation. Combat sortie generations are conducted to exercise the
wing’s ability to meet to the unit's combat sortie generation tasking under current war plans and
contingency operations.
   4.6.1. For scheduled combat sortie generations, publish the weekly flying schedule as a
   normal schedule. On the days the unit plans to exercise annotate scheduled exercise on the
   flying schedule and AF Form 2402, AF Form 2403 or electronic version. If an unannounced
   exercise is initiated, the remainder of the printed weekly schedule may be canceled and may
   be deleted from IMDS by the AMU PS&D.
   4.6.2. Combat sortie generation will usually include operations using Air Tasking Orders.
   See paragraph 4.7 for ATO procedures.
   4.6.3. When a scramble launch scenario is used, a launch "window" will be established for
   each line number or block of line numbers. Normal deviations will be assessed against all
   sorties.
   4.6.4. Sorties lost due to required scenario responses such as chemical warfare condition
   black, airfield attacks, etc., will be recorded as "XEH or XEL."
   4.6.5. If more sorties are flown than line numbers printed, those sorties will be considered
   flown as scheduled.
   4.6.6. Once the objectives established by higher headquarters or the commander have been
   met, the remainder of that day's schedule may be canceled/deleted from IMDS by the MOF
   PS&D.
   4.6.7. At the termination of the combat sortie generation, the unit's originally printed weekly
   flying schedule may be revised, canceled, or replaced with a new weekly schedule without
   recording deviations. Normal deviation reporting procedures will apply once finalized.
4.7. Air Tasking Order. The Air Tasking Order (ATO) can contain mission numbers, on-status
time/ time on target and configurations. A daily flying schedule, including aircraft tail numbers
for the first lines and spares, will be finalized and confirmed to operations and the maintenance
operations center not later than 2 hours prior to the first on-status/take-off time. The new
published schedule derived from the ATO, is applicable to all affected organizations and no AF
Form 2407 is required to implement the new schedule. All changes after the new schedule has
been published, up to the first unit crew show time, will be documented and coordinated on an
AF Form 2407. Unlike a planned sortie surge, early and late take-offs are recorded on second
 42                                 ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012


and subsequent sorties, unless an ops change is made to the ATO. Normal deviations will be
recorded against all sorties using the new published schedule derived from the ATO.
 NOTE: All sorties launched under “Classified ATOs” will be considered flown as
 scheduled. Classified ATO lines that are missed will be recorded as cancels in the MIS.
 Cancellations will be loaded into the MIS once the sortie is declared cancelled regardless
 of actual scheduled take-off time and ground aborts will be recorded in MIS.
   4.7.1. Alert Sorties. Sorties flown from alert because of a higher headquarters exercise,
   active air or practice scramble, or committed to fly from alert on the printed weekly schedule
   will be considered sorties flown as scheduled. Ground aborts will be recorded in MIS
   however no deviation is recorded against FSE, but the ground abort is recorded in MIS.
4.8. Unscheduled Tasking. When a unit is tasked with an unscheduled higher headquarters
tasking or self-initiated tasking (mobility exercises or weather evacuations), or other services
tasking which significantly impacts the printed weekly flying schedule, the printed schedule may
be revised or deleted from IMDS by MOF PS&D and replaced with a new weekly schedule
without recording deviations. For weather evacuations, the schedule will be cancelled in IMDS,
not deleted, so the data is available for historical attrition.
   4.8.1. If the schedule is revised or canceled and reprinted, the following procedures will be
   used:
       4.8.1.1. Normal deviation reporting procedures will be followed once the
       revised/reprinted schedule has been finalized. The revised schedule will be finalized a
       minimum of 2 hours before the first scheduled launch.
       4.8.1.2. Once the tasking terminates, the original schedule may be used or it may be
       revised or reprinted for the tasking period, as required. Normal deviation reporting is
       used once the revised or reprinted schedule is finalized.
       4.8.1.3. Normal deviation reporting procedures will be followed after a take-off time is
       established to a tasking by higher headquarters or other services.
   4.8.2. If the unscheduled tasking has an adverse impact on the monthly UTE rate goal, the
   commander has the option to adjust the monthly sortie UTE rate goal.
   4.8.3. An unscheduled tasking or actual combat operations may include use of an ATO.
   Deviations for all aircraft will be recorded IAW this instruction. For AMC aircraft assigned
   to a CENTAF AOR/ CAF base for contingency support, deviations will be reported IAW
   AMC guidance.
4.9. Test and Evaluation. Wings responsible for the scheduling of OT&E, DT&E, or IOT&E
aircraft are authorized to deviate from the published schedule for aircraft, which are engaged in
these programs without incurring a deviation. They may adjust, formalize the test requirements,
and select aircraft tail numbers up to 12 hours before the first scheduled OT&E/DT&E/IOT&E
launch of the day. Deviations will be recorded based on the adjusted daily test schedule and as
prescribed in this publication.
4.10. Scheduling Options to Maximize Sortie Production.
   4.10.1. Planned Sortie Surge. Units may plan to produce sorties at a higher than normal
   rate. A unit may also use a planned sortie surge when the rest of the unit is deployed to a
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                     43


  different location. A planned sortie surge is not considered a combat sortie generation or an
  unscheduled tasking. It should be conducted in a manner that takes full advantage of training
  opportunities inherent in a period of increased operations and maintenance activity. The
  number of sorties will be determined by training objectives and established by the OS and
  AMXS commanders. Printed sortie surge rates will exceed the daily sortie rate (average
  contracted sortie per O&M day based on the applicable monthly sortie/ flying hour contract)
  of the unit by at least 50 percent, but not less than the contract required sorties scheduled on
  the monthly contract/plan. For example, if a unit normally flies 22 sorties in a day, to qualify
  for a surge, that same unit would schedule at least 33 sorties for the surge day. The statement
  "Sortie Surge" must be printed in the remarks section of the affected day’s flying schedule to
  add sorties without incurring deviations.
     4.10.1.1. Surge scheduling scenarios should task maintenance and flying organizations
     realistically. For example, flat lining a surge is often not a feasible option. For example,
     scheduling a 12-ship to reach 60 sorties by turning the same 12 aircraft to fly 5 goes (12-
     ship turned 5 times) is often an unfeasible plan. Units should plan to get the maximum
     number of sorties possible from each aircraft committed to the schedule.
         4.10.1.1.1. Units should be cognizant of historical break rates and spare constraints
         when scheduling surges. Spares are quickly used up during surges and once spares are
         exhausted the capability to meet surge goals is severely limited.
     4.10.1.2. Extreme care must be exercised to avoid creating a backlog of unscheduled
     maintenance actions when scheduling sortie surges.
     4.10.1.3. Aircraft tail numbers, take-off times, line numbers, and configurations will be
     printed in the weekly schedule for each aircraft’s first sorties of each day. Include the
     statement "sortie surge" in the remarks section for each affected day.
     4.10.1.4. Only line numbers are required on the weekly schedule for subsequent sorties
     (i.e., the total number of sorties/line numbers the unit intends to fly). Other data such as
     take-off times, configurations, and missions may be printed as required by the unit. To
     the greatest extent possible, the day prior, units should try to confirm subsequent sorties
     NLT the daily maintenance production meeting,.
         4.10.1.4.1. However, early and late take-offs are not recorded on second and
         subsequent sorties. For all other deviations, normal deviation reporting applies.
     4.10.1.5. If more sorties are flown than what was intended (i.e., line numbers printed),
     these sorties will be considered flown as scheduled.
  4.10.2. Continuation Sortie. A continuation sortie is a sortie containing scheduled
  operations stops. Maintenance provides support limited to chocking the aircraft and
  fire/safety observer and the aircraft engines/Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) must remain
  running. EXCEPTION: C-130 aircraft, engines may be shut down to upload/download
  aircrew. Continuation sorties are designed to accommodate training events, optimize aircraft
  use and minimize maintenance manpower expenditure. Continuation sorties will be clearly
  identified in the published weekly flying schedule. This scheduling option is intended to
  allow the exchange of aircrew/passengers with minimal maintenance participation and
  aircraft possession does not return to maintenance. The initial crew on the sortie will brief the
  follow-on crew at the aircraft. Units may add continuation sorties onto scheduled sorties to

   make up for sorties lost earlier in the same week without recording deviations. Do not
   include these added continuation sorties in FSE unless there were no lost sorties earlier in the
   week. If no sorties were lost in the same week, the added continuation sortie will be an “add”
   deviation in FSE. NOTE: No maintenance or servicing is performed during the stop.
   Returning the aircraft to maintenance terminates the continuation sortie. This scheduling
   option is not applicable to fighter and attack aircraft.
   4.10.3. Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC). The ERCC sortie is used to optimize
   aircraft use. It involves turnaround of an aircraft incorporating partial or full crew change
   between two separate sorties. The difference between ERCC and continuation sorties is
   minor maintenance and servicing can be performed between sorties and since each is a
   separate sortie, deviations apply to each sortie. An aircraft is scheduled to fly an ERCC
   sortie in the published weekly schedule, upon landing, crew members are changed at the
   aircraft with at least one engine running. Minimum ground time should be scheduled between
   sorties. The crew of the first sortie must brief the crew of the second sortie at the aircraft.
   Other aircraft on the published flying schedule or previously flown aircraft not on the flying
   schedule (OCF, FCF, adds) can be tail swapped into the second sortie. For example, if two
   aircraft are scheduled to land at approximately the same time, either aircraft could ERCC to
   the later sortie. EXCEPTION:              C-130 aircraft, engines may be shut down to
   upload/download aircrew and B-52 aircraft, engines may be shut down to re-pack drag chutes
   and upload/download aircrew. NOTE: This scheduling option is not applicable to fighter and
   attack aircraft.

effectiveness rate by aircraft mission and design using the formulas below: AFRC CAF-gained
units will follow CAF instructions for scheduling effectiveness computation.

   4.11.2. Adjusted-Sorties-Scheduled = Sum of total sorties scheduled (home base, off station
   or deployed) minus (-) UTE cancellations.
   4.11.3. Calculated-Deviations = Sum of all deviations (including added aircraft) minus (-) air
   deviations, aircraft tail swaps, aircraft printed spare actions, ground aborted sorties flown by

                   MAINTENANCE SCHEDULING EFFECTIVENESS

5.1. Purpose. Maintenance Schedule Effectiveness (MSE). This is a leading indicator that
measures the unit’s ability to plan and complete scheduled maintenance events (i.e. inspections,
periodic maintenance, etc.) and scheduled use of maintenance resources (Static/IR/Alert Prep,
Training Aircraft, etc.) on-time per the maintenance plan. ACC goal for MSE is 95 percent. A
low MSE rate may indicate a unit is experiencing a high rate of turbulence on the flightline or in
the back shops. This indicator is primarily used as reliability indicator for maintenance managers
assessing the unit’s capacity to execute the scheduled maintenance plan.
   5.1.1. A cornerstone of successful maintenance scheduling and execution is an
   understanding of how the schedule is executed versus how it was scheduled to be executed.
   These differences in scheduled versus actual events are only recorded in the execution phase
   of the scheduling process and are called deviations. Deviation data must be recorded so that
   follow-up analysis can identify the appropriate corrective actions if any are needed. Without
   deviation data, analysis is impossible. Deviation data recording and analysis is the beginning
   of the process to continually improve the scheduling and execution process that leads to
   improved unit flying operations. The unit is responsible for documenting deviations to the
   weekly flying and maintenance schedule and determining the cause for each deviation.
   Deviations must be coordinated with the appropriate squadron/AMU before being assigned
   to a specific category. Schedule deviations that result from a sequence of events will be
   assigned a primary cause. A determination of the primary cause will be made by the parties
   involved to arrive at a unit position. The squadron operations officer and the AMU
   OIC/AMXS maintenance operations, along with MOF maintenance operations, will monitor
   deviations to ensure they meet the criteria in this publication. When conflicts arise,
   leadership of involved units will resolve them at the lowest level. All deviations will be
   recorded as described in this publication.
5.2. Computations:
   5.2.1. Compute the aircraft MSE using scheduled maintenance events in the printed weekly
   schedule. In order to make this data valuable it is important that the integrity of the data be
   maintained. Additionally do not discard standard accepted scheduling practices in order to
   improve rates, i.e., scheduling all inspections on Friday or not including hourly inspections in
   the weekly schedule. The IMDS database will be used to determine whether or not the
   maintenance actions were completed on time. For example, if a maintenance event is
   scheduled in the weekly flying and maintenance schedule for Monday through Wednesday,
   IMDS must show completed before Thursday for credit. For maintenance events extending
   into the next week, credit for completion is based on the last day of the scheduled event.
   NOTE: Periodic, Phase and ISO inspection completion will be measured using the
   completion date of the inspection. AMXS and MXS supervision will standardize the
   scheduled duration of the inspection for each MDS based upon the work card deck and fix
   phase critical path data determined from historical data provided by MDSA and Phase/ISO
   supervision assessments. Standardized durations will be documented and forwarded to MOS
   PS&D.

  5.2.2. The MXG/CCs may select additional areas (such as Aerospace Ground Equipment,
  Avionics Intermediate Shop, Alternate Mission Equipment, etc.) for local scheduling
  effectiveness tracking. The unit will establish standards for these programs. When reported to
  HHQ these locally selected areas will not be included in aircraft MSE rates.
  5.2.3. MOF PS&D will implement procedures for reviewing and recording scheduled
  maintenance actions daily, forward this data to maintenance analysis weekly for computation
  and publication. Daily review will be accomplished by MOF PS&D and will not be
  delegated.
  5.2.4. When a unit is tasked with a combat sortie generation, unscheduled tasking,
  unannounced exercise/real world contingency, or HHQ exercise that significantly impacts the
  printed weekly maintenance schedule, the plan may be revised or reprinted without incurring
  deviations. Utilizing MSE deviation Table 5.1, normal deviation reporting procedures will be
  followed once the revised or reprinted plan is finalized. The unaccomplished portion of the
  original maintenance schedule that was revised will not be included in the scheduling
  effectiveness formula.
     5.2.4.1. Units may revise or reprint the following day’s or remainder of that week’s
     maintenance schedule to compensate for adverse weather. This adjustment should be
     used only in extreme cases and recorded on an AF Form 2407. Once changed, normal
     deviation reporting procedures will apply.
  5.2.5. Squadron commanders will coordinate to cancel and reschedule maintenance actions
  to coincide with the portion of the flying schedule that was canceled after the unit or OS has
  achieved the UTE rate goal for the month. These canceled maintenance actions will not be
  included in MSE computations.
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                     47



Table 5.1. MSE Deviations and Functions
 DEVIATION                     FUNCTION
 Maintenance (MT)               Actions canceled to adding aircraft to the flying schedule, lack
                                of manpower, equipment or as a result of mismanagement.
 Operations (OP)                Actions cancelled or not completed on-time for operational
                                considerations or as a result of adding aircraft to the flying and
                                maintenance schedule to meet operations requirements. This
                                also includes maintenance events not completed due to
                                operations group actions. For example, Life Support Section not
                                completing scheduled maintenance as published in the wing
                                weekly flying and maintenance schedule.
 Higher headquarters (HHQ) Actions canceled or not completed as a result of higher
                                headquarters tasking from outside of the wing.
 Weather (WX)                   Actions canceled or not completed as a result of weather
                                conditions.
 Supply (SU)                    Deviations that result from verified parts back order condition.
 Other (OT).                    Aircraft impounded after publication of the weekly schedule,
                                unscheduled major maintenance where the scheduled
                                maintenance action cannot be accomplished because of tech data
                                restrictions, aircraft off base and unable to return or as a result
                                of Productivity/ Utilization Goal Days. Reference ACCI 21-118
                                for MSE computations.
 EXCEPTION: Any scheduled maintenance for an aircraft that is possessed by
 depot/PDM/Contract Field Team (CFT), that is not complied with because the aircraft is not
 released for possession as scheduled to the owning unit does not count toward MSE
 computations.
      5.2.5.1. Formula: Overall Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness Rate = Total
      Points Earned Divide by Total Points Possible x 100
      5.2.5.1. (36WG) Does not apply (see paragraph 3.1.3)
          5.2.5.1.1. To obtain only the OP-MX MSE rate , treat events with deviations in
          categories other than OP or MX as if they were not missed.
          5.2.5.1.2. Create generic IMDS JSTs (profiles) to capture completion or
          preparation of aircraft used for trainers, static displays (SD), Alert Prep, and
          Immediate Response (IR). These actions although they are not maintenance actions in
          the traditional definition (phase, TCTOs, Special Inspections, etc.) do consume
          maintenance capacity/resources and should be captured to show the complete use of
          maintenance resources.

                                            Chapter 6

               DEPLOYED OPERATIONS AND OFF-STATION SORTIES

6.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes rules and procedures used in planning, executing,
evaluating, and reporting of unit flying and maintenance schedules at deployed locations where
unit maintenance is provided. Sorties flown at deployed locations where no parent unit
maintenance is provided are considered off-station sorties. If parent unit support is deployed, this
is considered the same as home station support and normal deviation reporting applies. Limited
launch support is not considered parent unit maintenance.
6.2. General. Normal deviation reporting applies to deployed operations except as noted in this
chapter. Data from deployed operations will be transmitted or forwarded back to home station
and included in unit totals IAW ACCI 21-118.
6.3. Scheduling. In addition to the procedures for home station scheduling and reporting,
deployed units will use the following procedures when developing a weekly flying schedule and
reporting deviations:
   6.3.1. Separate block(s) of sortie sequence numbers will be assigned for deployment
   location(s).
   6.3.2. When a spare aircraft is launched for a scheduled deployment to a Forward Operating
   Location (FOL), the options in paragraph 6.5.1 apply to the home station and deployment
   location flying and maintenance schedules.
   6.3.3. Additions and cancellations at deployed locations, which are required to
   accomplish specific aircrew training requirements and make optimum use of available
   range time, are considered flown as scheduled. This does not relieve operations and
   maintenance from developing a viable and realistic flying schedule at the deployed location.
   The primary purpose of this flexibility is to allow the unit to make up non-effective sorties to
   ensure accomplishment of the deployment training plan. Procedures for changing the weekly
   schedule in Chapter 2 apply to deployment location flying and maintenance schedules.
   Additions and cancellations caused by ineffective planning are recorded.
   6.3.4. When operating at a deployed location using a daily ATO, follow procedures outlined
   in paragraph 3.7 of this instruction.
6.4. Deployed Daily Activity Report. Required information for deployed ACC units will be
transmitted to home station IAW applicable unit deployment plans. See ACCI 21-118, Chapter 4,
for required data.
6.5. Off-Station Sorties. Off - station sorties are those sorties flown from other than home
station and parent unit maintenance is not provided (e.g., cross-country sorties). Units will
publish sorties planned while off station. Take off and landing times may be TBD when
supporting another unit and the specific times are unknown at the time of publishing. The
following paragraphs outline the rules that apply to higher headquarters alert or off-station
sorties:
   6.5.1. When a spare is launched to the off-station/cross country location in place of the
   originally intended aircraft, one of the following options applies.
 50                                 ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012


      6.5.1.1. Option 1. The originally scheduled prime aircraft, which remained on base, may
      fly the sorties of the departed aircraft for the remainder of the week without recording
      FSE deviations. However, maintenance scheduling effectiveness is based on the
      published weekly schedule.
      6.5.1.2. Option 2. The sorties may be tail-swapped with a printed spare aircraft on each
      day's schedule.
   6.5.2. When an aircraft is off-station and cannot return to home station for its scheduled
   sortie, a deviation will be recorded for the reason the aircraft was unable to return. The
   reasons will be specific, i.e., maintenance, operations, weather, etc.
NOTE: If the off-station aircraft can fly its scheduled mission from its location, no deviation is
recorded.
6.6. Deployed MOF PS&D Support Operations.
   6.6.1. NLT 7 days after arrival of a new units arrival, MOF PS&D Superintendent will visit
   all decentralized scheduling activities and provide technical assistance as needed.
   6.6.2. Units will follow home station guidance.
   6.6.3. Homestation AVDOs will perform AVDO duties on deployed aircraft unless the
   possession changes to the deployed location. With homestation AVDO approval, CENTAF
   MOF PS&D will make MIS inventory/status transactions and coordinate message
   requirements with homestation AVDOs. If possession changes, CENTAF, MOF PS&D will
   perform all AVDO duties.
   6.6.4. Units will use CAF/MAF supplement to AFI 21-101 and ACCI 21-165 to develop
   weekly schedules and for FSE/MSE reporting.
   6.6.5. When deploying or deployed to the CENTAF AOR, units in addition to ACCI 21-165
   guidance will also follow AFI 21-101_USCENTAFSUP1 pre-deployment and deployment
   guidance.
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                   51


                                          Chapter 7

                 FLYING SCHEDULING REPORTING PROCEDURES

7.1. Purpose. This chapter provides instructions on flying scheduling reporting procedures. The
flying schedule must be loaded in IMDS to track scheduling and deviation data. Once loaded, the
IMDS Daily Mission Schedule background report (IMDS screen 361) or proposed maintenance
plan background report (IMDS screen 361) provides detailed base-level retrieval of flying and
maintenance schedule retrieved from IMDS. IMDS will also be used to provide higher
headquarters reporting of aircraft utilization.
7.2. Responsibilities:
   7.2.1. The MXG/CC will ensure procedures are established to verify the accuracy of all
   scheduling and deviation data.
   7.2.2. MOF PS&D section will publish the weekly flying schedule IAW Chapter 3 of this
   publication on AF Forms 2400 series or computer generated forms. The MOF PS&D will
   load the weekly flying schedule into IMDS by 1600L Friday (EXCEPTION: 2 hours after
   the squadrons last landing during printed wing night flying weeks) for the following week
   using the procedures in AFCSM 21-565V2. Refer to paragraph 4.5.1 of this instruction for
   daily tail number scheduling procedures.
   7.2.3. The MOC will review the on-line IMDS debriefed sortie recap, screen 174, and the
   IMDS background products daily Accomplishment Utilization Report (Screen 362),
   Deviation Detail Listing (Screen 181), Deviation Summary Inquiry (Screen 173) and
   Uncompleted Operational Events (Screen 719), daily to ensure accuracy of deviation
   reporting. The MOC will also review Uncompleted Operational Events, IMDS screen 719,
   daily to ensure uncompleted sortie lines are deleted using Operational Events Delete IMDS
   screen 883, if necessary after coordination with debrief section and MOF PS&D. The MOC
   will record additions, cancellations before crew show, late and early take-offs and landings,
   and Tail Swaps in IMDS as deviations occur.
       7.2.3.1. The debrief section will record aborts and in-flight emergency incidents in
       IMDS during the IMDS automated debriefing process. After a primary aircraft ground
       aborts and is replaced by a spare, debrief sections will ensure that the deviation code is
       recorded as a Spare deviation with the appropriate cause code {SP/GAA (GAB, GAC)}
       against the original aircraft; debrief sections will not record the deviation as a Ground
       Abort {GA/GAA (GAB, GAC)} against the original aircraft that was replaced by a spare.
       Analysis will count SP/GAA (GAB, GAC) as one ground abort deviation but will not
       count this against FSE (see paragraphs 4.3.2.5 and 4.3.4). For all other spare and ground
       abort deviations procedures debrief will follow procedures in paragraph 4.3.
       7.2.3.2. The MOC will coordinate with both the flying squadron and AMU on all
       changes and deviations to the daily flying schedule to assist in determining correct
       debriefing status codes. The MOC will provide sortie sequence numbers and sortie
       numbers to the squadron/AMU for all additions and cross-country sorties. Sortie numbers
       assigned to a specific tail number must be in sequential order (for example sortie number
       101 must be used on a specific tail number before sortie number 102). Unique sortie
       sequence numbers will be developed for deployed sorties.
 52                                ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012


          7.2.3.2.1. (Added-36WG) Deployed units will use deployed sortie numbers
          developed at home station in according to their home station guidance. Home station
          guidance will be used to validate accuracy of line numbers used for deployed sorties
          on AAFB.
      7.2.3.3. (Added-36WG) Deployed sortie call signs will use 1X on Mondays, 2X on
      Tuesdays, 3X on Wednesdays, 4X on Thursdays, 5X on Fridays, 6X on Saturdays and 7X
      on Sundays unless directed in the Air Tasking Order (ATO).
   7.2.4. The following instructions apply to IMDS screen 474, Cause Code Table; 342,
   Operational Event Cancellation; 343, Operational Event Tail Number Swap/Tail Number
   Spare; and 350, Deviation, Start/Stop/Correction Abort/Delete. The Ground Deviation Code
   block cannot be blank. Enter one of the following codes or one of the ground deviation codes
   in AFCSM 21-565V2:

 N           Do not use N code (all deviations are recorded). Code is available for use in
             IMDS but CAF units will not use this code.
   7.2.6. Cause Code. Enter one of the following codes to indicate the reason for a deviation or
   the agency, which caused a deviation. These codes must be entered into the IMDS Cause
   Code table as outlined in AFCSM 21-565V2. The maintenance indicator block is left blank
   when loading the following Cause Codes. For maintenance ground aborts do not use cause
   code MTx, only use GAA, GAB, or GAC.

                                  ATTRITION AND SPARES

8.1. Attrition. Attrition factors represent historical percentage of scheduled sorties lost to
causes outside unit control. Maintenance and operations schedulers add attrition sorties to
monthly contracts to ensure mission goals are met. Units may make a conscious decision, with
HQ ACC/A4J approval, to use different attrition factors from statistical attrition rates calculated
by MDSA.
   8.1.1. Attrition sorties are not substitutes for unit capability shortfalls, they are added to the
   contract to mitigate scheduling turbulence to facilitate that unit’s mission goals are met.
   Attrition sorties are planned for based on historical sortie losses captured and measured by
   MDSA. The monthly flying and maintenance plan will clearly identify attrition sorties for
   planning purposes. If attrition is less or more than planned, adjustments to the weekly flying
   and maintenance schedule will be made to prevent over-extending maintenance or exceeding
   the unit’s contract. A sortie lost will normally be flown in the same month the loss occurred.
   If at the end of a quarter combined losses exceed attrition figures, the OG and MXG/CCs will
   negotiate a resolution to the shortfall.
   8.1.2. The factors used to compute attrition will be MXx, OPx, SUx, WXx, ATx, SYx, OTx,
   EXH, EXL, and HQx cancels. Attrition and spare factors will be computed for and applied to
   each flying squadron. Monthly statistical attrition anomalies should be identified,
   documented and factored out of attrition calculations if necessary. MDSA will compute
   attrition factors monthly for each OS/AMU and provide the results to MOF PS&D and OSS
   Current Operations. During the annual “Proposed FHP”, MDSA will provide attrition factors
   by month for the entire next fiscal year.
 NOTE: Attrition and spare factors need not be developed for test and evaluation (CB)
 possession identifier coded aircraft.
   8.1.3. (Added-36WG) Deployed analysis function will compute and submit to home station
   all required metric factors for deployed aircraft for use with their annual flying hour program
   as required by home station leadership.
8.2. Attrition Factor Application:
   8.2.1. Attrition computation is based on unit historical data from previous similar flying
   months. For example, when computing attrition for Jan 06, use historical data for Jan 05, Jan
   04, Jan 03, Jan 02, Jan 01, etc. Use as much historical data as required ensuring seasonal
   variations are considered to determine a basis for attrition. When computing attrition, use the
   total sorties lost in a particular category. Do not use the difference between the sorties lost
   and those sorties added to make up for the losses. The formula for computing the attrition
   factor is Historical Sorties Lost divided by Historical Sorties Scheduled.

 MX Cancels                               .02
 OP Cancels                               .01
 SU Cancels                               .01
 OT Cancels                               .01
 AT Cancels:                              .01
 SY Cancels:                              .01
 EXH Cancels:                             .00
 EXL Cancels:                             .01
 HQ Cancels:                              .01
 Cancels attrition factor:                .09
 WX Cancels:                              .03
 Total attrition factor:                  .12
 Overall attrition factor is .12 or 12%


   8.2.2. Sample Application of Total Attrition Factor:
 Sorties Required                         1000
 Subtract attrition factor from 1:        (1-.12) =.88
 Divide                                   1000 by .88
 Required sorties to schedule 1,136.36, round up to 1137.
      Based on historical attrition of .12%, the unit can expect to lose 137 sorties to meet the
 required 1000 sorties.

8.3. Prorated Weather Attrition:
   8.3.1. Computation. Weather attrition sorties will only be used when sorties are lost because
   of weather. Weather attrition sorties will not be carried over into another month. Using the
   weather attrition factor, compute the number of anticipated sortie losses for weather. Divide
   the number of weather losses by the O&M days. This will determine the prorated weather
   attrition.
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                     57


       8.3.1.1. Sample Application of Prorated Weather Attrition Factor:
 Sorties Required                                      1000
 Subtract the weather attrition factor from 1          (1-.03) =.97
 Divide 1000 by .97                                    1000/.97
 Equals Required Sorties to Schedule                   1031
 Minus Sorties Required                                1000
 Expected Weather Losses                               31
 Divide 31 by O&M Days (20 for this exercise)          31/20
 Expected Sortie Losses per O&M Day             1.55
 A unit would expect 1.55 sorties lost each O&M day in the month for weather. Thus, a total of
 31 sortie losses (1.55 sorties x 20 O&M days) would be expected for that month. Whenever
 weather losses exceed the total projected weather losses (number of O&M days to date x 1.55,
 round up to the next whole number), a unit may add sorties not to exceed the difference
 between the sorties lost due to weather and the total projected weather losses. For example on
 the 11th O&M day of the month, a unit lost a total of 30 sorties to-date due to weather. The
 expected prorated weather sorties lost to-date is 18 (1.55 times 11 equal 17.05, round up). The
 unit also added 4 weather sorties earlier in the month. The unit could add up to 8 sorties. (30
 sorties lost to date due to weather minus 18 prorated losses minus 4 weather adds equals 8
 weather adds available)
8.4. Spares. The spare requirements will not exceed 20 percent (30 percent for training units
owning TF coded aircraft) of aircraft committed to the flying schedule, rounded up to the next
whole aircraft. NOTE: During Planned Sortie Surges the MXG/CC determines the amount of
spares that will be committed. However, leadership must consider health of the fleet when
scheduled spares above 40 percent during surges.
 NOTE: Units should be cognizant of their historical break rates and spare constraints when
 scheduling surges. Spares can be quickly used during surges and once spares are exhausted
 the capability to meet surge goals is severely limited.
   8.4.1. MDSA computes annual spare aircraft requirements by month, using historical aircraft
   first sortie logistics losses and provides this information to the MOF PS&D for use in
   computing spare aircraft requirements. Spare computation is based on unit historical data
   from previous similar flying months. For example, when computing spares for Jan 06, use
   historical data for Jan 05, Jan 04, Jan 03, Jan 02, Jan 01, etc. Use as much historical data as
   required ensuring seasonal variations are considered to determine a basis. The formula for
   computing spare factors is Historical First Sortie Deletions/Cancellation divided by historical
   first sorties scheduled.
       8.4.1.1. A first sortie is defined as a sortie flown by an aircraft that has not previously
       flown for the day (0001-2400 flying period). For example, if 8 aircraft are committed to
       the schedule and there are 14 total sorties scheduled, the first 8 sortie line numbers (i.e.
       101-108) should reflect all 8 committed aircraft tail numbers before they are re-scheduled
       (turned) against the last 6 (i.e. 109-114). This would be reflected as an 8 x 6 and should
       not be reflected as a 6 x 8 because of scheduled take-off times.

          8.4.1.1.1. Operations may define first sorties or turns by mission profile, take-off
          times, but for the purposes of this instruction the sortie turn pattern is defined against
          initial aircraft flown and scheduled turns of the same or a portion of the same aircraft.
       8.4.1.2. Sample Application of Spare Factors.
1st Sortie Maintenance Cancellations          .10
1st Sortie Supply Cancellations               .03
1st Sortie Ground Aborts                      .05
Spare factor                                  .18 or 18%
A sample figure of 12 first sorties is used in the following computation:
Spare aircraft required equals 1st sorties scheduled times the spare factor and rounded up to the
next whole number.
12 x .18 = 2.16        Spares Required is 3
  8.4.2. The computed spare requirement may be adjusted to compensate for multiple
  configurations and syllabus constraints. When additional spares are added for multiple
  configurations, units will not exceed one spare per configuration.
       8.4.2.1. Additional spares are authorized to support higher headquarters taskings and
       special missions (if required by the tasking).
       8.4.2.2. At least one spare aircraft is authorized per MDS for each flying day.
       8.4.2.3. Unmanned Aerial Systems training missions are authorized an additional spare
       to support increased aircrew training requirements due to crew size ratio.
  8.4.3. (Added-36WG) Spare rules for Andersen AFB:
       8.4.3.1. (Added-36WG) All LIGHTNING and large scale MAJCOM/COCOM directed
       missions will have, at a minimum, one-spare aircraft annotated on the weekly flying
       schedule.
       8.4.3.2. (Added-36WG) ERCCs will not have a spare annotated on the weekly flying
       schedule, but every attempt will be made to schedule two aircraft to support the ERCC
       with the “best” aircraft accomplishing the ERCC mission.
       8.4.3.3. (Added-36WG) Airborne airshow flyover spares will launch and turn into local
       sorties unless otherwise coordinated with the EBS/CC and 36 EAMXS/CC.
       8.4.3.4. (Added-36WG) Spares for local training missions will be negotiated between
       the EBS/CC and the 36 EAMXS/CC on a case by case basis, but every attempt will be
       made to ensure a spare aircraft is annotated each flying day on the weekly flying
       schedule.

                                  Chapter 9 (Added-36WG)

9.1. (Added-36WG) Quiet Hours: In coordination with the local community, the 36 Wing,
will not normally schedule takeoffs or landings during the hours of 2200 to 0600. Exceptions
will be considered on a case by case basis with approval from the 36 OG/CC:
   9.1.1. (Added-36WG) The following categories will be used for airfield quiet hours at
   Andersen AFB.

Table 9.1. (Added) Quiet Hour Categories
CATEGORY A: Least restrictive; no takeoffs, overhead and SFO patterns. Engine starts
and taxiing are permitted, and all maintenance functions are allowed minus engine runs
above idle on the trim pad.
CATEGORY B: No takeoffs, approaches or full stop landings to runway 24R or 06L
(weather permitting). Aircraft will fly all approaches and land on runway 06R or 24L, hold
at EOR and wait to get towed to final parking. All maintenance functions are allowed minus
engine runs above idle on the trim pad.
CATEGORY C: No takeoffs, approaches or full stop landings to runway 24R and 06L
(weather permitting). Aircraft will fly all approaches and land on runway 24R and 06L, hold
at EOR and wait to get towed to final parking. Aircraft will not taxi, no running engines, no
AGE operations. Maintenance vehicle movement is restricted to critical taskings.
CATEGORY D: Most restrictive; no takeoffs, no landings, no running engines, no
maintenance functions to include: no AGE, no fueling, no unnecessary vehicle movement.
Additionally all, aircraft will be shut down prior to the start of the quiet period.
9.2. (Added-36WG) General Scheduling Information (B-52s).
   9.2.1. (Added-36WG) 36 MXG will provide FMC aircraft consistent with the 36 WG/CC
   directed Bomber Force Posture (BFP).
   9.2.2. (Added-36WG) During “steady state” BFP operations, 50% of the 36 WG assigned
   aircraft will be committed to operations during O&M days.
       9.2.2.1. (Added-36WG) During HHQ directed exercises, the 50% assigned aircraft rule
       will not apply and the 36 OG/CC will determine the aircrew flying priority.
   9.2.3. (Added-36WG) 36 MXG will support a baseline of 44 effective sorties per month
   (based on a 4 to 1 sortie to aircrew ratio) with a 14.7% scheduled attrition factor, for a total
   of 51 sorties per month, but this may be altered dependent upon HHQ requirements with 36
   MXG/CC and 36 OG/CC approval. The 36 MXG/MOF Maintenance Capability Study will
   be used to determine/adjust the attrition factor.
   NOTE: (Added) During months with abnormally high attrition, or reduced O & M days,
   weekend flying may be added.
   9.2.4. (Added-36WG) Weather/Ops/Mx cancels will be added to the monthly flying
   schedule when actual attrition exceeds the monthly scheduled attrition. Every attempt will be
   made to schedule these as soon as possible once the scheduled attrition has been exceeded.
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                  61


      9.2.4.1. (Added-36WG) If the scheduled sortie and RAP requirements are achieved
      prior to the end of the month, sorties may be cancelled with approval of the 36 WG/CC,
      or designated representative.
   9.2.5. (Added-36WG) One O&M day per quarter will be designated a no-fly Maintenance
   Training Day.
   NOTE: (Added) The first day after aircraft swap out is designated as a no-fly day to be
   used to conduct in processing and local orientation.
9.3. (36WG) (Added) Planned Sortie Surges
   9.3.1. (Added-36WG) Locally scheduled surge operations will be IAW ACCI 21-165 surge
   criteria. During surge operations, dynamic scheduling will be used to ensure the required
   sortie count is achieved. Surge will consist of necessary sorties to accomplish training
   objectives. Surge operations will not proceed or precede HHD weeks and will be conducted
   Monday through Friday.
9.4. (36WG) (Added) Munitions requirements
   9.4.1. (Added-36WG) No live munitions will be flown during local training sorties during
   the first or last week of a unit’s deployment.
   9.4.2. (Added-36WG) MXG will conduct a LOADEX IAW the DEPORD.

Terms
Active Associate—ARC/ANG component unit retains principal responsibility for weapon
system or systems; shares with one or more AD units.
Addition—An increase in sorties or aircraft added to the printed weekly flying schedule.
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                      67


Air Abort—An airborne aircraft that cannot complete its primary or alternate mission.
Air Deviation Code—A deviation from the scheduled sortie flight plan occurring after aircraft
take-off.
Alert Sorties—Sorties flown from alert because of a higher headquarters exercise, active air or
practice scramble, or committed to fly from alert on the printed weekly schedule will be
considered sorties scheduled and flown as scheduled.
Attrition—Losses expected based on historical data. Sorties added by maintenance scheduling
to a unit's sortie contract to allow for expected losses due to maintenance, operations, supply, air
traffic control, sympathy, HHQ, other cancels, and weather cancels as computed IAW
Attachment 2. If attrition is less or more than planned, adjustments to the schedule should be
made to prevent overextending maintenance and/or to stay within the unit's sortie flying hour
program. Attrition sorties are not substitutes for capability shortfalls; they are additive to the
contract to ensure mission goals are met. A sortie lost will normally be flown in the week/month
the loss occurred. If at the end of a quarter, losses exceed attrition figures, the OG/MXG CCs
will come to an agreement on how the shortfall will be corrected.
Attrition Reserve—Reference AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment,
Distribution, Accounting, and Termination. Attrition reserve aircraft are those aircraft required to
replace primary aircraft inventory losses in a given year projected over the life span of the
weapons system. These aircraft are distributed to operational and training units to evenly spread
life cycle fatigue and ensure all aircraft receive periodic systems upgrades and modifications.
Assigned attrition reserves are occasionally realigned to maintain fleet balance.
Backup Aircraft Inventory (BAI)—Aircraft above the PMAI to permit scheduled and
unscheduled maintenance, modifications, inspections and repair without reduction of aircraft
available for operational missions.
Cancellation—An aircraft or sortie that is removed from the printed schedule for any reason.
Change—A recompilation of a unit's month-by-month flying hour plan, this is required when
the unit's flying hour allocation changes.
Chargeable Aircraft (CHRG ACFT)—The number of aircraft against which units should build
their programs. Except in cases where possessed aircraft is forecast to be significantly different
from the PMAI such as in building or down-sizing units, chargeable aircraft will normally equal
the unit's PMAI, PTAI, or PDAI, as applicable. In these cases, HQ ACC/DO/LG will assign a
chargeable aircraft accountability for the unit in the ACC Flying Hour First Look and Baseline
Messages.
Classic Associate—AD component unit retains principal responsibility for weapon system or
systems; shares with one or more ARC/ANG units.
Combat Sortie Generation—A process by which aircraft are generated in a minimum time,
during peacetime or wartime, through concurrent operations that may include refueling,
munitions loading/ unloading, aircraft reconfiguration, and -6 inspection and other servicing
requirements. These exercises test a wing’s ability to meet current war plans and contingency
operations.
Continuation Sortie—A scheduled sortie containing scheduled operation stops. When a crew
completes their training/mission and performs an operation stop, the engines/APU remains
 68                                 ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012


running and maintenance does not service the aircraft. The aircraft can subsequently be launched
without the participation of maintenance personnel, except for a fire/safety observer. The prime
purpose is to on/off load crew members. EXCEPTION: For safety, C-130 aircraft, engines may
be shut down to upload/download personnel. NOTE: N/A to fighter and attack aircraft.
Crew Ready—An aircraft that has been properly inspected, fueled, required weapons loaded,
necessary maintenance actions completed, the exceptional release signed off (for the first flight
of the day) and the tail number passed to operations. NOTE: Units will develop and publish
specific crew ready times for each assigned MDS as agreed upon by the OG/CC and MXG/CC.
Crew Show—The time that the aircrew arrives at the aircraft.
Deployed Sorties—Sorties launched away from home base or isolated areas at home base, with
parent-unit maintenance provided. For the purpose of this instruction deployed sorties are
considered home station sorties.
Daily Maintenance Production Meeting—Meeting required by AFI 21-101 and CAF Sup to
review the previous day’s accomplishments, verify aircraft and equipment utilization and
scheduled maintenance requirements for the current and next day, establish work priorities, and
coordinate schedule changes.
Deviation—A departure from the printed weekly flying schedule.
Early Landing—Scheduled sorties landing more than 15 minutes prior to scheduled landing
time. Do not record early landing deviations for hot pit turn sorties launched more than 15
minutes prior to the scheduled take-off time. Early landing deviations are not included in FSE
calculations.
Early Take-off—Scheduled sorties launched more than 30 minutes prior to scheduled take-off.
NOTE: Do not record early take-off deviations for hot pit turn sorties.
Exercise—A unit or higher headquarters event designed to test or evaluate an organization's
plans, procedures, and operational/maintenance capabilities. Exercises are a planned sortie surge,
a combat sortie generation, or an unscheduled tasking. Operational readiness inspections and
wing directed operational readiness evaluations are combat sortie generations.
Extended Sortie—Scheduled sorties that land more than 15 minutes past the scheduled landing
time. If the extended sortie originated on time, record the subsequent late take-off or deletion
against the agency that caused the late landing. If the extended sortie did not originate on time,
record the subsequent sortie deviation against the agency that caused the original delay.
External Customer—Outside the control of the operational wing, a user of aircraft sorties that
dictates, either partially or wholly, flying schedule execution (e.g., Joint Airborne Air
Transportability Training (JA/ATT) users, Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAM) users or
channel mission users.
Ferry Sortie—Those sorties flown to transfer an aircraft to or from a maintenance facility or to a
new assignment, including inter-command, inter-unit transfers.
Flown as Scheduled Sortie—A sortie flown by a specific aircraft on the date and time indicated
on the printed weekly schedule, and those aircraft that are defined as "flown as scheduled"
elsewhere in this instruction.
ACCI21-165(PACAF)_36WGSUP_I 18 OCTOBER 2012                                                     69


Flying Scheduling Effectiveness (FSE) Rate—The FSE rate is the percentage of sorties flown
as scheduled. This rate determines how efficiently the planned/printed flying schedule was
executed. It also indicates unit turmoil caused by flying schedule deviations.
FSE Maintenance/Operations (MX/OPS) Deviation Rate—The number of maintenance
and operations deviations divided by adjusted sorties scheduled multiplied by 100. Reflects the
number of deviations within unit control. The MX/OPS deviation rate is a subset of FSE. Only
count the MX/OPS deviations used to compute the FSE rate.
Functional Check Flight (FCF)—The flight of an aircraft, in accordance with the applicable
dash -6 manual, to verify the airworthy condition of the aircraft.
Ground Abort—Event after crew show time that prevents a "crew ready" aircraft from
becoming airborne. Ground aborts are categorized as maintenance (GAA, GAB, GAC),
operations, HHQ, weather, sympathy, other, etc… The difference between a ground abort and a
cancellation is after crew show it is a ground abort, before crew show it is a cancel. A ground
abort by itself is not a deviation, but can cause a deviation such as lost sortie or late take-off.
Higher Headquarters—A controlling agency above wing level.
Home Station Sortie—Sorties launched from the home base or deployed locations where parent
unit maintenance is provided.
Hot Pit Turn—Refueling aircraft with engines running between sorties at a designated location
with approved equipment IAW T.O. 00-25-172. Hot pit refueling provides minimum aircraft
turnaround time and reduces fueling personnel and equipment support requirements.
Immediate Response Aircraft—Mission capable aircraft postured to meet short-notice taskings
which allow flexibility in meeting required Designed Operational Capability (DOC) timing.
In-Flight Emergency (IFE)—An airborne aircraft that encounters a situation or emergency that
results in an IFE being declared by the aircrew. (Not a deviation, but will be recorded IAW
Chapter 6.)
Tail Swap—Tail number swaps made to the daily flying schedule IAW paragraph 4.3.2.6
Aircraft tail swaps are swaps between printed aircraft on the same day, between printed aircraft
and spare aircraft on the same day or between printed aircraft and aircraft that have previously
flown that day (cross country return, OCF, FCF, etc.) The term is synonymous with the
previously used term “Interchange.”
Late Landing—Aircraft landing 15 minutes past its scheduled landing time. Does not apply to
continuation sorties. If the sortie originated on time, record the subsequent late take-off or
cancellation against the agency that caused the late landing. If the extended sortie did not
originate on time, record the subsequent sortie deviation against the agency that caused the
original delay. Late landings are not included in FSE calculations.
Late Take-off—Scheduled sortie launched more than 15 minutes after scheduled take-off time.
Maintenance Scheduling Effectiveness—A measurement used to determine what percent of the
scheduled maintenance actions were actually completed as scheduled in the weekly flying
schedule.
Mission, Design, and Series (MDS)—An acronym for aircraft mission, design, and series. For
EXAMPLE: B052H, F015C, etc.

Off-Station Sorties—Sorties flown away from home base (cross-country) and parent unit
maintenance is not provided. This includes aircraft that divert or break off-station and parent unit
maintenance is sent to repair and launch the aircraft. NOTE: Off-station sorties are considered
flown as scheduled. Deviations incurred are not used in scheduling effectiveness or abort rate
computations.
Operational Check Flight (OCF)—The first flight of an aircraft that has had extended
downtime or extensive maintenance which does not require an FCF.
Operations and Maintenance Day (O&M)—Monday through Friday, not including federal
holidays or command directed family days.
Pen-and-Ink Changes—Changes made to next week's flying schedule on AF Form 2407 after
the WG/CC has signed the schedule and prior to 1600 hours local Friday. EXCEPTION: Pen-
and-Ink changes are allowed 2 hours after the squadron's last landing during printed wing
night flying weeks.
Planned Sortie Surge—A scheduling option where a unit may plan to produce sorties at a
higher than normal rate. To qualify as a surge, the number of planned sorties will exceed the
normal daily sortie rate by at least 50 percent. This will be based on the monthly daily sortie rate
as determined by MOF PS&D.
Possessed Aircraft—Aircraft under a wing commander's operational control and responsibility
IAW AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting.
Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI)—Aircraft assigned to meet the primary aircraft
authorization (includes PDAI, PMAI, POAI, PTAI). PMAI will not change except when
approved by HQ USAF.

level. It is identified by a six-digit alphanumeric program element code (PEC). The sixth
character, “F", identifies the PE with the Air Force.
Program Element Code (PEC)—The six digit alphanumeric code used to identify the Program
Element (see definition above).
Ready Aircrew Program (RAP)—Continuation training regulated under the AFI 11-2 MDS
specific series for training of aircrews assigned to units primarily flying fighter, bomber, and

Scheduled Sortie—An aircraft scheduled for flight by tail number on the weekly flying schedule
and confirmed on the daily flying schedule. Incentive flights are considered scheduled sorties
and published in the weekly schedule. Functional Check Flights and Operational Check Flights
are excluded.
Scheduled Maintenance Action—A maintenance requirement printed in the weekly schedule.
Sortie—A sortie begins when an aircraft becomes airborne or takes off vertically from rest at
any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when the aircraft returns to the surface except
for continuation sorties.
Sortie Contract—A written agreement between operations and maintenance and approved by
the WG/CC. It specifies the number of sorties and hours to be flown.
Spare Aircraft—An aircraft specifically designated on the flying schedule to replace aircraft
that cannot fly its sortie. Spares can include aircraft that have been canceled, aborted, flown an
earlier sortie, scheduled in a later sortie, or an aircraft that has been released after FCF/OCF. Do
not count "Printed Spares" used as deviations when computing FSE.
Spare Ground Abort—Event after crew show time that prevents a "crew ready" aircraft from
becoming airborne, but is replaced by a spare that meets the mission requirement. Spare ground
aborts are categorized as maintenance (GAA, GAB, GAC). The difference between a ground
abort and a spare ground abort is the scheduled line is accomplished, where the ground abort is
not. A spare ground abort is not a deviation, but can cause a deviation such as late take-off. Spare
ground aborts do not count towards FSE.
Total Active Inventory (TAI)—Aircraft assigned to operating forces for mission, training, test,
or maintenance functions (includes primary aircraft inventory, backup aircraft inventory,
attrition, and reconstitution reserve).
Training Goal—The unit's completion of a formal course training syllabus and/or phase of
instruction (TF coded units only).
Unscheduled Tasking—Tasking in which initial notification occurs after publication of the
weekly schedule.
Unit Training Assembly (UTA)—A planned period when guard or reserve personnel
participate in training duty, instruction, or test alert. For the purposes of this instruction, one
UTA is considered a single Saturday through Sunday weekend. This is an authorized and
scheduled training assembly lasting at a minimum of 4 hours. This assembly is mandatory for all
troop program unit members. (AR 135-91)
Regularly scheduled unit training assembly (RSUTA)—Training time treated as a UTA or
MUTA for which pay and retirement point credit are authorized. (AR 140-1)
UTE Remaining—A measurement of the UTE required to accomplish a unit's remaining flying
hours with assigned aircraft over the remaining months of the fiscal year.
Utilization Rate (UTE)—For ACC aircraft, the UTE is expressed in the number of sorties flown
per aircraft per month.
Weekly Flying and Maintenance Schedule—The schedule, agreed to by operations and
maintenance, and signed by the OG/MXG/WG/CCs, to support the unit's flying and maintenance
requirements. In this publication it is referred to as the "flying schedule."
