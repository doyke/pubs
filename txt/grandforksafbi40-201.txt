1. SCOPE
     1.1. Evidence suggests that strategic placement of AEDs increases the chances of survival
     during sudden cardiac arrest. Public access refers to the accessibility of the AED device and
     materiel required to respond to a cardiac arrest. Public access does not mean that any
     member of the public who witnesses a person in cardiac arrest should use an AED. Public
     access to AEDs implies that appropriately trained individuals have the capability and assets
     required to respond to a cardiac emergency prior to the arrival of emergency medical
     personnel.
     1.2. According to Congressional findings in H.R. 2498, up to 700 lives are lost every day in
     the United States from sudden cardiac arrest. Most arrests are a result of irregular rhythms
     called ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. These lethal heart rhythms cause the
GRANDFORKSAFBI40-201 23 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                           3


  pumping action of the heart to stop abruptly and can rapidly lead to death. The technique of
  delivering an electrical shock, called defibrillation, is the best known treatment for
  ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. To be effective, defibrillation
  must be administered within minutes of a cardiac arrest. For every minute that passes
  without defibrillation and effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), a victim’s chance
  of survival decreases 7 to 10 percent. After as little as 10 minutes, very few resuscitation
  attempts are successful. In the past, the ability to defibrillate was solely in the hands of
  trained emergency medical personnel, who may have a long response time. With the advent
  of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs), a trained rescuer can quickly and easily
  defibrillate a cardiac arrest victim and potentially save a life. New generation AEDs are safe,
  effective, lightweight, low maintenance, and relatively inexpensive. The scope of AED
  training and utilization is applicable to all Air Force owned facilities (to include space leased
  for period(s) over 179 days) as defined by the Air Force Real Property Agency and its
  occupants and visitors. The Federal Cardiac Arrest Survival Act [of 2000] (CASA) was
  enacted with provisions to encourage AED use in federal buildings and create limited
  immunity for qualified individuals who use AEDs. CASA provides limited immunity from
  legal liability for harm resulting from use or attempted use of an AED by lay responders.
  The AF will use AEDs in support of the Public Access Defibrillator (PAD) program. An
  AED is considered a PAD when made available for use in a non-medical facility.
  1.3. For the purpose of this instruction,
     1.3.1. An event begins when a PAD is removed from its publicly accessible location to
     provide service to a victim of cardiac arrest and ends when the PAD is removed from that
     victim.
     1.3.2. ―Public‖ will mean ―not private; open to or concerning the people as a whole.‖
     Airmen are considered a subset of ―public.‖
     1.3.3. ―Accessible‖ will mean ―property that someone can access.‖
     1.3.4. ―Basic Life Support (BLS)‖ will mean the performance of CPR and use of an
     AED.
     1.3.5. A ―qualified individual‖ will mean any person who has current training in
     performance of BLS.
     1.3.6. A ―lay responder‖ will mean any qualified individual for whom providing BLS is
     a secondary or additional duty to their primary responsibility.
  1.4. Exclusions (AF facilities not required to comply with this instruction):
     1.4.1. 319th Medical Group, 319th Civil Engineer Squadron Fire Department (319
     CES/CEF emergency responder units), 319 Security Forces with AEDs located in
     vehicles for whom emergency response is a primary duty in their job description, such as
     but not limited to police cars, ambulances and fire vehicles. To qualify for exclusion,
     these facilities must be accredited by the appropriate parent authority having regulations
     which meet or exceed the requirements in this instruction.
     1.4.2. Medically licensed individuals possessing AEDs, which comply with other
     regulations meeting or exceeding all requirements in this regulation.

       1.4.7. Facilities explicitly excluded in writing by the Director, Base Medical Services
       (DBMS), typically the MTF Commander or ARC Medical Commander (on non-
       collocated bases).
    1.5. Inclusions:
       1.5.1. Unless excluded above, all AF-owned facilities as defined by the Air Force Real
       Property Agency will comply with this instruction.
       1.5.2. Facilities excluded above but identified as at-risk by the host installation safety
       office or DBMS may be recommended to the host installation PAD Program Coordinator
       (PPC) for participation in the PAD program.

                TRAUMATIC STRESS RESPONSE (TSR) INFORMATION

A4.1. What is TSR Stress Management? It is a comprehensive system of crisis intervention
designed to assist individuals and groups affected by traumatic events (natural disasters, terrorist
events, and suicides, death - either accidental or intentional). Previously, this intervention was
known as critical incident stress management (CISM).
A4.2. What events might precipitate a request for TSR services? Many types of events have
the potential to produce individual and community traumatic stress. Events include large-scale
disasters (tornadoes, bombings, hurricanes, etc.) and small-scale disasters (suicide, death or near-
death of coworker, workplace violence event, etc.). TSR services will be provided after
traumatic events to help those who have experienced the events. The goal is to assist those
affected by traumatic events to cope with the normal stress reaction in an effective manner.
These actions are intended to minimize the impact of exposure to these events and prevent or
mitigate permanent disability if possible.
A4.3. What is the procedure for requesting TSR services? The office of record for TSR
services is the Mental Health Clinic (747-4460). Please address any inquiries about TSR
services to the Chief of the TSR team.
GRANDFORKSAFBI40-201 23 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                     19
