     GUIDANCE FOR AIR FORCE VOLUNTEER EXCELLENCE AWARD (VEA)

A3.1. Award Description: The VEA was established to recognize federal civilians, family
members, military retirees and federal retirees who perform outstanding volunteer community
service of a sustained, direct and consequential nature.
A3.2. Award Eligibility: Authorized by United States Air Force Chief of Staff, for federal
civilians, family members, military retirees, and federal retirees who perform outstanding
volunteer community service. To be eligible, an individual’s service must be performed either in
the local civilian community, or the military family community, and be of a sustained and direct
nature. The volunteer service must be significant in character, produce tangible results and
reflect favorably on the United States Air Force. To be awarded the VEA, eligible persons must
be nominated by their supervisor in the form of a memorandum or by the voluntary agency for
which they donated their service. Approval authorities shall ensure the service to be honored
merits the special recognition afforded by this award. The VEA is intended to recognize
exceptional long term community support and not a single act or achievement. Further, it is
intended to honor direct support of community activities. For the purpose of this award,
attending membership meetings or social events of a community service group would not
normally be considered qualifying service, while manning a community crisis action phone line
would. The volunteer service may have been donated over time at another military installation
or in a local civilian community. For example, long term service as a Family Services volunteer,
Boy/Girl Scout leader, etc. The nominee must be performing services on a voluntary basis, not
as part of a tasking, and may not result in any personal gain. This award will not be reflected in
personnel records or earn promotion credit for federal employees selected to receive this award.
The VEA may be awarded posthumously and when so awarded, may be presented to such
representatives of the deceased as deemed appropriate by the commander.
A3.3. Selection Board: Award of the VEA shall be authorized by the United States Air Force
on behalf of the Air Force Chief of Staff. This authority is delegated to wing commanders. The
commander, at his or her discretion, may convene a board or establish another review process to
screen and select award winners; however, the commander will retain final award approval. The
approving authority shall certify that the individual meets all eligibility criteria and that service
was honorable throughout the award period. Individuals may receive only one award of the
VEA. Subsequent service may be recognized by local volunteer efforts. The awarding of the
VEA is limited to no more than one award per quarter. However, commanders may choose the
option of a semi-annual or annual award period.
A3.4. Writing the Nomination: Nominations will be one page (front only). Direct, fact-filled,
results-oriented nominations are preferred. The nomination will emphasize the benefits realized
by the volunteer service and include qualifying factors that are out of the ordinary. Some
suggestions for consideration are: leadership and management, scope of responsibility,
innovative and creative ideas, community involvement, initiative, and reliability. Nominators
will be specific when giving the time frame of the accomplishment.
A3.5. Award Period: All nominations must be submitted in time to be reviewed so the award
can be presented during National Volunteer Week.
