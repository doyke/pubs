    attend due to mission requirements (e.g., deployed or extended TDY) a non-military parent
    may attend on behalf of the member. The sponsoring member is required to attend for
    families with dual military members. In circumstances as stated above, when the sponsoring
    parent is not able to attend, the commander and first sergeant of the sponsoring member will

    appropriate actions from the 375 AMW/CC to include base barment. The sponsor and

    3.5. The board chairperson will make the final determination on actions to be taken.
       3.5.1. If the action of the board includes community service or other conditions as the
       consequences of juvenile actions, the juvenile and sponsor/parent will sign the contract
       format. (Reference: Attachment 4) Failure to accept the terms of the contract or
       violating the contract will result in recommendation for further administrative action by
       the 375 MSG/CD to the 375 AMW/CC and possible referral to civilian authorities.
       3.5.2. Action other than entrance into the program will be handled through security
       forces and staff judge advocate channels.

       recommended as a condition for the Juvenile Misconduct Agreement, the sponsor will

       counseling.
   3.6. Any open case which is not successfully completed will be formally reviewed for
   further action by the board.
   3.7. The board will review open cases with broken contracts and make recommendations for
   further administrative action to the board chairperson.

such actions.
   4.1. Submit all appeals, in writing, to the 375 SFS/S5R and then to the 375 MSG/CD, IN
   TURN, within 10 calendar days of receipt of the action to the board. The responsible unit
   commander must approve active duty military dependents’ appeals. Do not forward appeals
   if not approved by the unit commander.
   4.2. The juvenile’s parent or sponsor must originate and sign all appeals. They may include
   supporting letters and other documentation.
   4.3. Appeals are reviewed by the 375 MSG/CD, who makes the recommendation to the 375
   MSG/CC for a final decision. After the 375 MSG/CC makes his/her decision, there is no
   further right of appeal. Additionally, since the 375 MSG/CD initially hears the case,
   including all mitigating and extenuating circumstances, he/she determines the appropriate
   consequences, along with the other board members, and he/she signs all correspondence
   directing disciplinary or administrative action. He/she may also consider having a
   disinterested party make the recommendation to the 375 MSG/CC for his/her final decision.
   4.4. With the written approval of the 375 MSG/CC, the imposition of sanctions can be
   delayed pending resolution of the appeal. Automatic or minimum sanctions covered in other
   instructions, such as loss of driving privileges for DUI or revocation of exchange privileges
   for shoplifting may not be appealed with JMRB sanctions.
5. Completion Letters. It is the intent of the program to provide offenders direction and make
amends for offenses. To reiterate that purpose, the 375 MSG/CD will ensure a letter of
congratulation is mailed to juveniles once they complete their assigned tasks. (Reference:
Attachment 5)
