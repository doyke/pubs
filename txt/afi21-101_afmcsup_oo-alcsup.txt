             returned to the issue point, counted and verified by the PSC or functional
             equivalent. When cloth rags are returned, the person receiving them will
             annotate in the written or electronic rag tracking log that the items have been
             returned. AFMC Form 310 Lost Found/Item Report must be initiated for
             any cloth rag (when used in a closure or final assembly) that cannot be
             accounted for.
             10.2.1.9.2.3.3. (Added) All employees performing maintenance in FOD
             critical areas, on aircraft, engines and accessories, or providing a service to
             these organizations will perform an inspection of the work area, prior to
             closing out a task, or moving to another area to ensure that cloth rags have
             not been inadvertently left in the area.
    10.2.1.18. (Added) The supplemental list is a listing of all items kept in tool kits
    (TKs) that are not listed on the Tool Kit Custody Receipt Listing (TKCRL).
    Supplemental listings will contain at a minimum, the national stock number (NSN)

       location, and TK identification (ID). The supplemental list will be signed and dated
       by both the employee and the supervisor immediately after the last entry on the list.
       A copy of the supplemental list will be kept with the TKCRL, and on file by the
       supervisor. Use AF Form 3126, General Purpose 8½ x 11 or AF Form 3136 General
       Purpose 11 x 8½.
       10.2.1.19. (Added) Tools removed from a TK used by more than one person will be
       tracked by one of the following methods: AFMC Form 62, CTK Inventory and
       Control Log or electronic equivalent; by using an electronic keyed device on a TK,
       (swiping of the tool card to sign in or out of the TK). The following information will
       be provided through a printable report: tool nomenclature, date out/in, location or
       end item of use, and name of borrower.
          10.2.1.19.1. (Added) The owning organization’s test measurement diagnostic
          equipment (TMDE) monitor will be responsible for routing precision
          measurement equipment (PME) items for calibration. PME items maintained in a
          TK will either be individually shadowed within the TK, or be placed in
          containers. If placed in containers, the container will be controlled IAW
          paragraph 10.5.1.3.1.1
          10.2.1.19.2. (Added) TMDE monitors will issue a receipt to be kept in the TK
          for tools removed for calibration, certification or repair.
       10.2.1.20. (Added) Cleco Control Procedures. Clecos, wedge lock fasteners, and
       other similar holding devices (hereafter ‘clecos’) are considered tool items, and will
       be marked with the TK ID number, controlled, and subject to inventory and lost tool
       procedures. Clecos will be shadowed in the TK either individually, in containers, or
       on trays. If clecos must remain on an aircraft or component for multiple shifts, an
       informational note will be made in aircraft record and/or in the Work Control
       Document (WCD) task description block of the specific WCD operation number
       where the clecos were installed. This installation note will be stamped and dated by
       the technician who installed the clecos on the aircraft or component. When the clecos
       are removed, another informational note will be made indicating clecos removed.
       The removal statement will be stamped and dated by the technician that removed the
       clecos. Total quantity of clecos installed/removed will be reflected in the
       informational note.
       10.2.1.21. (Added) Tools used to support temporary duty (TDY), only if taken from
       an existing CTK or individual tool kit (ITK), will have an AF Form 1297, Temporary
       Issue Receipt, documenting, tool NSN, nomenclature and quantity of tools. AF Form
       1297 will be present with tools to serve as a TKCRL. A copy will be left in the
       existing kit to ensure accurate inspection and inventory records are maintained. All
       copies will be signed by employee and supervisor and a line will be drawn through
       the unused portion of the list. If TMDE is included in the tools taken TDY, a copy of
       the AF Form 1297 will be given to the TMDE monitor for their records. All
       inventories of such tools will require the AFMC Form 309, AFMC Tool Control
       Inventory Record, for daily and supervisor inventories.

        10.2.1.21.1. (Added) Tools checked out of a tool crib/PSC to support a TDY
        will be requested on a OO-ALC Form 515, Tool Request, and tracked in the
        Electronic Facility Equipment Management System (EFEMS). A copy of the
        OO-ALC Form 515 will be used as a TKCRL for the duration of the TDY. TKs
        left in place at TDY locations will be inventoried and transferred between team
        chiefs on a OO-ALC Form 515. A copy of the OO-ALC Form 515 will be
        forwarded to the issuing tool crib by the returning team chief upon his/her return.
        While TDY, team chiefs will coordinate with the issuing tool crib on
        broken/replacement tools.

        outlined in the contractor’s quality plan and must be coordinated with the
        respective contracting officer and contract functional manager or his/her
        designated representative. All contractors working within OO-ALC will be
        required to inventory their tools at the beginning of the shift, at the end of each
        task, and at the end of each shift to check for any lost or missing tools. Any lost
        tools not found must be reported immediately to the contracting officer,
        production area supervisor, and MXG tool manager. Control and issue of
        government provided contractor TKs, kit template, and ID numbers will be
        accomplished using OO-ALC Form 516, Establish or Revise Tool Lists or

          be controlled as follows: Such items requiring replacement due to usage or
          breakage will be exchanged on a one-for-one basis as soon as possible. Every
          attempt will be made to recover and return all pieces of broken expendable tools
          to tool crib/PSC prior to replacement. If the tool or a significant portion (as
          determined by the supervisor) is lost, a copy of a completed AFMC Form 310
          must be presented before a replacement tool may be issued.
       10.3.6.8. (Added) TKCRL Management. The tool issue center located in tool
       crib/PSC will manage the TKCRL. During the TK issue, the tool crib attendant and
       the employee will ensure the TKCRL, and TK quantities match, tools/items are
       marked per marked column, and are accurate to include drawer locations. The
       employee and tool crib attendant will sign the TKCRL. The master will be kept by
       Maintenance Support Squadron/Authorized Contractor. One copy will be provided
       for the first line supervisor to be maintained on file, and one copy will be placed in a
       protective container (plastic bag, binder, etc.) and provided to the employee for
       retention in the TK. Out of stock items will be reflected on the TKCRL, annotated

        back ordered, and placed on back order. When these items are received, the
        responsible employee and tool crib attendant will initial and date all three copies of
        the TKCRL. The TKCRL master copy will be used as the turn-in document for
        employees when they leave an organization, or when they terminate employment.
        Pen and ink changes to the TKCRL (i.e. piece count, backorders, etc.) will be
        accomplished by tool crib/PSC tool issue center personnel only, and will be reflected
        on all three copies. The tool crib attendant and kit owner will initial these changes.
            10.3.6.8.1. (Added) Tools on back order will be tracked in EFEMS, and a
            receipt issued to the TK owner. The receipt will be date stamped to provide back
            order visibility. On new kit issues the appropriate quantity will be annotated on
            the TKCRL for the backordered item.
                10.3.6.8.1.1. (Added) TKs with attached issued containers/side box will be
                listed on TKCRL.

            is used for TDY support shall be marked (laser, etching or permanent marker)
            with Hill or Randolph AFB Bldg. # and office symbol. Items that cannot be
            marked by laser, etching or permanent marker will be identified with a metal tag
            lasered or etched with HILL or Randolph AFB Bldg. # and office symbol, and
            secured to item in a way that it is not easily removed. Shop machinery
            accessories/attachments and or end items used to adjust or operate equipment
            when used to support a TDY, will have an AF Form 1297 initiated with a
            description of all items issued along with an AFMC Form 309. The AFMC Form
            309 will be annotated at the end of shift inventory each day the items are used
            during the TDY.
        10.3.9.1. (Added) The sharp edge of blades will not be exposed when not in use (i.e.
        buried in foam, put in a container, etc.). If used, tweezer tip protectors or razor blade
        covers, need to be accounted for on the TKCRL or the Supplemental list.

        locker. These items will be marked with the last name and first initial of the owning
        individual. NOTE: Shop PPE – PPE that is intended for shop use i.e., face shield for
        shop use at a drill press, will be marked with the organizational symbol.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                                 13


       10.3.15.2. (Added) All non-disposable PPE will be exchanged on a one-for-one
       basis. AFMC Form 310 will be initiated for all lost non-disposable PPE in high FOD
       critical areas.
          10.5.1.3.1. (Added) Tools, impractical or too small to mark will be identified on
          the OO-ALC Non-Marked list. This list will be approved, signed and dated by
          the complex tool program manager and kept on file in the tool issue centers. The
          Complex TCM will also post the list on the Tool SharePoint site. All tools/items
          listed in MARKED column as ‘Y’ are required to be marked with the TK number.
          Tool sets/kits with multiple miscellaneous tools will be listed in the MARKED
          column as ‘Y’. If the kit/set contains tools which are listed on the OO-ALC Non-
          Marked list, they are not required to be marked with TK number. All other tools
          within the kit will be marked with TK number. NOTE: Asterisks located in the
          DESCRIPTION column may apply to older TKCRLs. Tools impractical to mark
          but are large enough to make a representative impression may be individually
          shadowed.
              10.5.1.3.1.1. (Added) Containers (cases, pouches, tubes, boxes, etc.) will be
              shadowed and marked, lasered, or etched with the TK number, and quantity.
              Lids or caps will be marked and listed on TKCRL/supplemental list only if
              they can be separated from the container making two individual pieces. If an
              identification number becomes illegible, the TK owner will remark container
              by end of shift.
       10.5.7.1. (Added) Upon taking custody of an ITK, the kit owner will externally
       mark the kit with their last name, first initial and organizational symbol in any order.
       ITKs will also be marked with the TK ID number on the inside of the TK in an area
       not visible from the outside of the TK. TK owners are responsible to update changes
       to organizational symbols if and when they occur. CTKs will be marked on the
       outside of the TK with the ID number and the organizational symbol. DTKs will be
       marked on the outside of the TK with the ID number and the organizational symbol.
          10.5.7.1.1. (Added) All TKs will be assigned a TK ID and each tool in the TK
          will be marked (excluding tools on the Non-Marked list) with the TK ID number,
          prior to initial issue. Tools being replaced will be marked prior to replacement by
          assigned tool crib personnel. Tools will be laser marked where possible and is the
          preferred method.
          10.5.7.1.2. (Added) External mounted devices (i.e., such as vices) will be
          marked under the mounting block to prevent the TK number from being easily
          viewed, and will be subject to inspection requirements and lost tool reporting
          procedures.
          10.5.7.1.3. (Added) Tools made of a material incapable of laser or etching (i.e.,
          rubber, rawhide, plastics etc.) shall be marked with a permanent marker. If the
          marking becomes illegible, the tool will be remarked before the end of the shift.
          10.5.7.1.4. (Added) Military units will mark their mobility TKs for deployment

      10.6.1. (Added) Locally Manufactured/Modified Tools (LM/MTs). Each MXG will be
      responsible to approve and control special tools and locally manufactured/modified tools
      (tools that have been made or modified for a specific job function).
         10.6.1.1. (Added) When procuring tools to be modified, a OO-ALC Form 515 must
         be completed by the requestor, describing the tool to be modified, reason for the
         modification and intended use. The OO-ALC Form 515 must then be signed by the
         supervisor, prior to being taken to the tool crib/PSC. The procured tool will be
         reviewed by engineering for modification.
         10.6.1.2. (Added) LM/MTs will be controlled. Approved and authorized LM/MTs
         may be in a TK, but must be marked with the TK number, shadowed, and identified
         on the supplemental list.
         10.6.1.3. (Added) Tools listed and issued to a TK will not be modified. Dressing or
         sharpening of tools is allowed IAW TO 32-1-101, Use and Care of Hand and
         Measuring Tools and does not constitute a modification.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                                 15


          10.7.2.1.1. (Added) Replacement. A limited stock of replacement tools will be
          maintained by 309 MXSS. The supervisor will ensure quantities and types of
          tools in stock are not excessive and/or co-mingled. Tool bin labels will include
          NSN or part number, unit of issue, item description, and maximum bin levels.
          Stock levels may be adjusted in support of special projects, special operating
          requirements, or if existing demand data is insufficient to support mission
          requirements. A single occurrence of a mission limiting status is not sufficient
          reason to establish an adjusted stock level, but may be an indicator to review
          demand data for accuracy. Up to a 90-day level of items that are subject to wear
          and breakage may be maintained to replace unserviceable items. When bin levels
          drop below determined minimum levels, new stock will be ordered. Tool
          crib/PSC will stock standard size (e.g. 3/16”, 1/4”, 5/16”) drill bits, and a nominal
          amount of standard size machine and hand reamers under 1” diameter.
       10.7.2.6. (Added) An appointment must be made with tool crib/PSC, prior to TK
       issue and turn-in. During TK issue both the issuing tool attendant and the receiving
       mechanic/technician will verify each tool listed on the TKCRL for accuracy of tools
       issued, serviceability, and proper TK marking. Tool Crib Attendants will ensure
       employees read and return the signed original AFMC Form 311, Certificate of
       Responsibility for Government Property, to the tool crib/PSC, prior to receiving a tool
       issue. Tool crib/PSC will retain a copy of the EFEMS work order, the AFMC Form
       311, and the master (official) TKCRL signed by the employee, which will be
       maintained by the tool crib.
          10.7.2.6.1. (Added) ITKs are issued for use to a single individual. CTKs are
          issued to a supervisor for use by their crew. Dispatchable Tool Kits (DTKs) are
          issued from the PSC to perform a specific task, or for use by a specific Air Force
          Specialty Code and is designed to be used outside the tool room or work center.
          One individual is responsible for the DTK. All appropriate inspections are
          applicable to the TK.
          10.7.2.6.2. (Added) TK Content Determination.               The production/project
          engineer or planner, production supervisor and technicians (users), define the
          composition of templates required for new workloads. These templates must be
          approved through the product/project group engineering and planning section at
          squadron-level, prior to submission for implementation. A OO-ALC Form 516 is
          required to establish a new template, or to revise or delete an established template.
          Each type of standardized template will be assigned a template number. The OO-
          ALC Form 516 is initiated by the supervisor and will include the following: a
          complete list of required tools, NSNs, nomenclatures, issue quantities, drawer
          locations (i.e., Drawer 1, Drawer 2) and will be signed by a second level
          supervisor or equivalent before they are forwarded to the Group TCM.
          Supporting commercial data, (source, part number, catalogue page or screen print)
          will be provided for adding non-stock listed parts.
          10.7.2.6.3. (Added) Since the supervisor is ultimately responsible for TKs under
          his/her control, the supervisor or designated representative (a non-Bargaining
          Unit) will sign the AFMC Form 309 verifying the required 365-day inspection has
          been properly completed. This may include TKs assigned directly to the
16                             AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014


            supervisor. Previous AFMC Forms 309 will be stored/filed until a supervisor
            review has been accomplished on the current AFMC Form 309.
            10.7.2.6.4. (Added) CTKs will be inventoried and transferred from supervisor to
            supervisor as needed. The TK will be updated to match template changes as
            required. When a supervisor is not available or has been replaced, the CTK must
            be transferred to the second-level supervisor until a permanent supervisor is
            assigned or turned into the tool crib.
            10.7.2.6.5. (Added) A separate AFMC Form 309 will be maintained in each TK
            for each shift that uses that TK. Previous AFMC Forms 309 will be stored/filed
            until a supervisor review has been accomplished on the current AFMC Form 309.
        10.7.2.8. (Added) TK Issue. OO-ALC Form 515 is signed by the first-level
        supervisor for ITKs (second-level supervisor for CTKs) and forwarded to the group
        TCM to ensure all information is correct. Once OO-ALC Form 515 is complete it
        will be used to order TKs from tool warehouse. The group TCM or alternate will
        submit work order requests electronically in the Electronic Federal Equipment
        Management System (EFEMS) to tool crib/PSC with a reasonable need date.
            10.7.2.8.1. (Added) Template Change. Template changes will be acceptable
            once a calendar year if needed. If more than one change is required during the
            year it should only be for new workloads and/or a change of workload; if the
            additional template change is for any other purpose, a letter of justification will
            need to be provided from the squadron director to the group TCM for approval.
            Templates may be changed to ensure the right number of tools, proper tool to
            complete a given task, skill or work area, or a combination thereof to attain
            configuration control/standardization. Template changes will be documented on
            OO-ALC Form 516, and forwarded to the group TCM. The group TCM will
            forward any required template changes to the tool warehouse/tool issue center so
            the template may be updated. Issued TKs will be reconfigured to meet new
            template requirements if the template is revised. TK composition should be the
            same for all employees possessing the same skill who are working in the same
            work center.
            10.7.2.8.2. (Added) TK turn in. When an employee is permanently reassigned
            to a new work center or moves from his/her current job assignment, the TK will
            be turned into the tool center or transferred to the supervisor. The tool crib
            attendant and employee will inventory the kit for accuracy of tools returned and
            proper TK marking. Tool attendant and mechanic/technician will sign an EFEMS
            transaction report. A copy will be provided to the mechanic/technician for their
            TK turn-in receipt once all tools have been accounted for.
            10.7.2.8.3. (Added) Items listed on the supplemental list will be turned-in to
            current supervisor. Inventory, control, and lost tool procedures will apply to
            supplemental items.
     10.7.4. (Added) Applicable MXG will be responsible to establish procedures and/or
     operating instructions that provide tool control guidance for their respective PSCs.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                                17


       10.7.4.1. (Added) PSC End of Shift Inventory. At the end of each shift, PSC will
       print EFEMS Current Temporary/Special Issues Report and verify physical status.
       File report and annotate page 1 of AFMC Form 309 (Tool Control Inventory Record)
       in daily shift inventory binder.
          10.7.4.1.2. (Added) The annual inventory of tools and equipment in all tool
          cribs or PSCs will be documented by attaching a cover letter to the inventory
          listing used to conduct the inventory that contains the following information: the
          crib inventoried, the date the inventory was conducted, names of the individuals
          who participated in the inventory, discrepancies found, corrective actions taken
          and the supervisor’s name and signature.
          10.7.4.1.3. (Added) When permanently changing a group resource center code
          (RCC), ensure information (i.e., tool card) provided to the tool crib/PSC has been
          updated for the purpose of tracking loaned tools and equipment.
          10.7.4.1.4. (Added) DTKs. DTKs assigned and maintained within a tool
          crib/PSC will require an AFMC Form 309 to document inspections as follows:
          When the TK is issued and returned to the tool crib/PSC during the same
          shift/day, the responsible mechanic along with the tool crib/PSC attendant will
          perform a joint inventory. If the TK is not returned during the same shift or day,
          the responsible mechanic will complete all required inspections and annotate page
          1 of the AFMC Form 309. Pages 2 and 3 may be used as required and page 4 will
          be used to document lost tools. At least once every 365 days the PSC/tool crib
          supervisor or designee (that is the alternate supervisor, wage leader, or military
          equivalent) must inspect the DTKs assigned to a PSC/tool crib and document on
          page 4 of AFMC Form 309.
             10.7.4.2.1.1. (Added) Temporary loaned tools will only be loaned to
             employees and supervisors with a valid tool card. Tools checked out from the
             tool crib or PSC may be stored in the employee’s ITK, but not in their
             personal drawer. These items will not be on loan for more than five calendar
             days. If tools are required for more than five calendar days, the location of the
             tool must be physically verified and the loan must be renewed.
             10.7.4.2.1.2. (Added) The          tool     crib/PSC      will     notify the
             supervisor/mechanics and Group TCM of delinquent tools on the EFEMS web
             page. Supervisors can also check the site and notify employees of delinquent
             tools. Employees with delinquent loaned tools will not be allowed to check
             out additional tools until the delinquent tool has been reconciled.
             10.7.4.2.1.3. (Added) Tool crib employees will notify supervisor and Group
             TCM regarding over-due tools via e-mail.
             10.7.4.2.1.4. (Added) Tool management employees will post a list regarding
             overdue tools at the tool crib or issue point.
          10.7.5.2.1. (Added) Point of Use Station (POUS). Items are added to POUS
          machines after production supervisor has given written approval. Written
          approval will be verified by Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) for content.
          Initial stock lists are coordinated between material and production personnel.
18                          AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014


        NOTE: Recoverable tools and items issued through the tool warehouse/crib will
        not be stored in or issued from POUS.
     10.7.5.3. (Added) Usage reports will be distributed each month to third-level
     supervision. The usage report must reflect the following minimum requirements:
     issued product, name of technician, quantity of issue, time/date of issue, and location
     of issue. Usage reports will be used to identify highly pilferable items. Reports will
     be kept a minimum of 2 years. NOTE: It is the responsibility of MXG supervision
     to identify high pilfered items. If identified as high pilfered, these items will be
     issued as a one-for-one swap.
        10.7.5.3.1. (Added) If PPE is identified as high pilfered (by MXG supervision),
        these items will be controlled as a one-for-one swap through supervisor issue.
        10.7.5.3.2. (Added) POUS machines will be inventoried by the owning
        organization on a quarterly basis and identity tags verified for content.
        Minimum/maximum levels are reviewed at this time; slow or dead stock will be
        removed. Inventory accuracy is verified by QAE.
     10.8.1.8. (Added) Lost Tools. Tools identified as missing from a TK, tool cribs or a
     PSC will be reported immediately to the supervisor by the employee who lost a tool
     (or item) on an AFMC Form 310. The supervisor will also contact the group TCM
     immediately for official reporting. The tool (or item) owner will document the loss
     on page 4 of AFMC Form 309. The supervisor will ensure AFMC Form 310 Block
     17a is signed by the second level supervisor (if applicable), 17b signed by the third
     level supervisor (if applicable), and 17c is signed by the Group TCM. Block 18 will
     be signed by the squadron director, deputy, or higher. The lost tool/item package
     AFMC Form 310 has a 7-workday suspense back to the group TCM once it is issued.
     The group TCM will ensure the AFMC Form 310 is complete, and has been properly
     coordinated.
        10.8.1.8.1. (Added) The person issued the tool/item must search the immediate
        work area for the missing tool/item, and immediately report it to their supervisor.
        The supervisor must conduct a search of the areas including inside equipment
        where the tool may have been used.
        10.8.1.8.2. (Added) If a tool is lost across groups or in an area not usually
        assigned to the TK owner, the immediate supervisor or alternate supervisor of that
        area must be notified along with their applicable TCM. This will make
        supervisors aware of a lost tool in their area of responsibility so appropriate lost
        tool procedures may be taken. NOTE: The employee who lost the tool will
        report to their owning organization’s TCM for accomplishment of Lost Tool
        Report. The TCM will supply a courtesy copy to the TCM of the affected area.
        For example: an EMXG employee loses a tool in AMXG. The EMXG employee
        would notify the AMXG supervisor and AMXG TCM. The EMXG TCM would
        initiate the lost tool/item report and would also provide a courtesy copy to the
        AMXG TCM.
        10.8.1.8.3. (Added) In every case, an AFMC Form 310 will be provided to
        issuing tool room for tool/item replacement and be maintained in the master TK
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                                  19


            file. The group TCM will maintain a copy of the AFMC Form 310, and copies
            will be forwarded to the employee, the TK owner’s supervisor, and the Complex
            TCM. Follow AFMAN 23-220, Reports Of Survey for Air Force Property, if
            applicable. For lost stamps, the employee will provide a copy of the AFMC Form
            310 to the stamp manager to obtain a new stamp.
            10.8.1.8.4. (Added) A tool that is found will be reported to the group TCM
            within 2 hours. Tools found prior to completion of the lost tool reporting process
            will be returned to the TK owner. Once documented, a completed copy of AFMC
            Form 310 will be forwarded to tool crib/PSC to be maintained in the master TK
            file, and copies will be forwarded to the TK owner, TK owner’s supervisor and
            the Complex TCM who will maintain for 2 years.
            10.8.1.8.5. (Added) Tools that are found after the lost tool investigation and
            reporting process have been completed will be returned to tool crib/PSC by the
            MXG TCM if a replacement tool has been already issued. A new AFMC Form
            310 must be initiated for the found tool. Recovered tools returned to tool crib/PSC
            will be either de-marked and returned to stock if serviceable or properly disposed
            of if unserviceable.
     10.9.4. (Added) Initial Work Center Briefings. All newly assigned, temporary,
     contractors, transferred and loaned personnel with access to production areas, will receive
     a work center specific tool and equipment briefing.
     10.10.13. (Added) Shop supervisor’s review of the AFTO 244 will be documented in
     Part IV of the AFTO 244 with review intervals of 180 days, at which time the 244 or
     computer generated equivalent will be reviewed for correctness and accuracy.
  11.2. (Added) For Mock-up Control procedures follow AFMCI 21-130, Depot
  Maintenance Materiel Control and AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, for material
  procedures.
  14.11. (Added) Dropped Object Prevention (DOP) Program.
        14.11.1.1. (Added) The OO-ALC DOP monitor will establish supplemental DOP
        program guidance as necessary. Leadership of groups (and each squadron) which
        directly maintain or service aircraft while in flight test operations, will designate a
        DOP FP in writing. The group DOP FP will keep a complete listing of their squadron
        DOP focal point (FP) in their continuity book. DOP program contact information on
        the locally developed visual aid will include that of Hill AFB, OO-ALC, group and
        squadron DOP FP (as applicable).
        14.11.1.2. (Added) DOP training for those who directly maintain or service aircraft
        while in flight test operations will be included in the recurring training courses.
        Contractors consult your statement of work or contract management office for
        previously established DOP training requirements.
        14.11.1.5. (Added) Any delay in reporting a Dropped Object (DO) could result in
        death or damage to aircraft and/or equipment as the object may be lying on the
        airfield in the path of an aircraft taxing/landing/taking off. To ensure maintenance
        integrity of timely reporting, anyone who observes a condition which appears to have
20                             AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014


         resulted in a DO will contact the appointed supervisor (at that present time) of the
         affected aircraft or Ogden Air Logistic Complex Alert Center immediately (Complex
         Alert Center). If a supervisor is notified, they must immediately notify Complex Alert
         Center. Upon receiving notification of a DO incident the Complex Alert Center will
         immediately notify 75 ABW Base Operations (Ops) (777-1861) of a possible foreign
         object (FO) on the taxiways/runway.
            14.11.1.5.2. (Added) Group DOP FPs will send updates and all supporting data
            (i.e. pictures, etc.) to OO-ALC DOP monitor until the incident report is closed.
            14.11.1.5.4. (Added) All DOP FPs will submit quarterly reports to the OO-ALC
            DOP monitor by the fifteenth day of the first month after the start of a new
            quarter. This report will contain a summary of each DO incident to include data
            which correlates to items 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 15, 16, 18, and 20 (i.e. public property
            damage or MISHAP caused by DO (if known)) of AFI 21-101, attachment 11.
            OO-ALC DOP monitor will submit quarterly reports to the Hill AFB DOP
            monitor by the twentieth day of the first month after the start of a new quarter.
            This report will contain a summary of each DO incident.
            14.11.1.5.5. (Added) Each designated DOP program representative (group level
            and higher) within OO-ALC will attend the Hill AFB Quarterly FOD/DOP
            Program Committee meeting, and if requested, will brief all DO occurrences for
            the previous quarter pertaining to their organization. If unable to attend, ensure a
            qualified representative has access to quarterly data and any incident reports so
            they are able to field possible questions from committee members.
  14.19. (Added) Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention Program
  14.19. (Added) Supplemental Directives. The OO-ALC Foreign Object Damage (FOD)
  monitor will establish supplemental FOD program guidance as necessary. 75 Air Base Wing
  (ABW) establishes the host-tenant memorandum of agreement to outline organizational
  responsibilities for Air Force Material Command (AFMC) flightlines, runways, taxiways,
  parking ramps, and outside maintenance areas that are shared with the ABW and tenant units.
  Each organization responsible for storing, producing, maintaining or regenerating aerospace
  vehicles, products, ground support and/ or test equipment including the systems and/ or
  subsystem components will establish supplemental guidance addressing FOD prevention.
  This supplemental guidance shall expand upon its FOD prevention program procedures,
  policies, and requirements.
         14.19.1.3. (Added) OO-ALC CC or deputy will identify areas that have been
         designated as critical/ non-critical foreign object (FO) areas. Refer to OO-ALC QP
         management information system (i.e. SharePoint, etc.), FOD/DOP information, for a
         current designation letter and listing of areas. It is imperative group FOD focal point
         (FP) (group level and below) coordinate with leadership and re-evaluate an area in the
         event of changes or new workload locations, and forward updated listings to the OO-
         ALC FOD monitor to maintain currency.
     14.19.2. (Added) All maintenance personnel will take action and adhere to the
     maintenance discipline known as “clean-as-you-go.” After work inside a panel, door,
     access cover, cowling, component, etc. is performed, personnel will accomplish end-of-
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                                  21


     task or end-of-shift clean-up (whichever is applicable) to the area as necessary to make
     the area free of FO. Prior to closure or component mating, inspect and clean the inside
     area as necessary to make it free of FO. As a minimum: the designated work area will be
     cleaned at the end of each established duty shift, as necessary to make the area free of FO
     for housekeeping purposes.
        14.19.2.1. (Added) Aircraft, missiles, munitions, Aerospace Ground Equipment
        (AGE), engines, or components in temporary storage will be monitored by the
        responsible supervisor in the applicable organization to ensure security of covers and
        other associated caps/ plugs remain installed and the surrounding areas kept clean for
        housekeeping purposes. Management will make readily available all necessary caps,
        plugs, covers, etc., for use by maintenance personnel in their immediate work area for
        the prevention of FO intrusion.
        14.19.2.2. (Added) Organizations which use various means other than the TO
        prescribed intake plug while performing maintenance in or around engine intakes will
        establish a documented control measure for its installation and removal (i.e.
        installation/removal steps listed separately on a work control document); approved by
        organizational leadership.
            14.19.2.2.1. (Added) A pre-run worksheet will be established by each squadron
            or group which operate aircraft engines in either a Aircraft Engine Run Hush
            House, Trim Pad, or Test Cell. For installed engine runs on the trim pad include
            only applicable items. Engine run personnel will complete, and the engine run
            supervisor will ensure, all worksheet FOD prevention/ FO inspection items are
            complied with and documented prior to engine start. For hush house runs, this
            worksheet will be maintained by the applicable A-10/F-16 Flight Test Section
            Supervisor. For Test Cell runs, this worksheet will be maintained by the
            Propulsion (Engine Shop) Supervisor.           Contact records management for
            requirements of Air Force Records Information Maintenance System. Completed
            forms will be retained in accordance with Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).
            The worksheet will include, at a minimum; the following headings: engine type,
            model and series (TMS), engine serial number(s), remarks, run supervisors name,
            signature and date. Annotate the area inspection with performing technician's
            stamp number and date accomplished. In regards to FOD prevention, at a
            minimum, area inspection will include: inlet FOD/FO; exhaust FOD/FO;
            aircraft/engine exterior inspection for FO; test stand/ thrust bed/ test equipment
            for FO; TK inventory complied with (C/W), ensure all CTK and test equipment is
            accounted for and secured by a means to prevent it from becoming a FOD hazard
            before each engine start, check all door tracks for obstructions, debris and dirt;
            check air inlet baffles and screens for rivet security, obstructions and debris and
            dirt; check test bay for cleanliness and check augmenter (exhaust) tube for dirt
            and/ or damage; visually inspect aircraft and engine components for loose
            hardware, debris and/ or tools; ensure the run bay is washed down
            (weather/Environmental Protection Agency permitting) and free of all FO before
            engine start. Recommend a follow-up inspection behind calibration and/or
            facility maintenance actions, which take place to or above the engine mount
            fixture, prior to the next engine operation. Units may add additional inspection

        areas/ steps as appropriate.
        14.19.2.2.2. (Added) Aircraft engine and turbine AGE component test facilities
        will have a pre-engine run inspection of any test stand fixture and surrounding
        area for cleanliness and to eliminate any possible item, which may be ingested
        during engine operation.
            14.19.2.2.2.1. (Added) Aircraft engines located inside the engine test cell
            will have an intake bellmouth screen installed prior to each engine operation
            (to include motoring).
     14.19.2.3. (Added) Unless otherwise stated in specific technical order or
     maintenance group (MXG) local guidance, covers and plugs (e.g., engine, pitot
     tube(s) to include ejection seat) required by the applicable technical order will remain
     installed up to one hour prior to aircrew arrival; unless there are personal safety issues
     or cover installation impedes maintenance task being performed, as applicable.
     14.19.2.4. (Added) All engine intake inspection (bunny suits) used for aircraft
     intake and exhaust inspections will have elastic/Velcro® arm and leg cuffs.
     14.19.2.5. (Added) Restricted/ controlled area badges and other officially issued
     temporary visitor badges/ passes must remain properly displayed and secured when
     not conducting operations in an AFI/ TO identified critical intake area during engine
     operation. All badges/passes will be removed and secured (stowed) when within
     fifty-feet of the AFI/TO identified critical intake area during engine operation.
     14.19.2.6. (Added) Wear of Hats on the Flightline: HILLAFBI 13-201, Air Traffic
     Control and Flight Operations has established local guidelines for the wear of hats
     and head covers on the airfield (flightline) with regards to FOD prevention and safety.
     The wearing of a badge, beret, hairpiece, hat, metal insignia, wig, etc. in a designated
     FO critical maintenance area, other than the airfield (flightline), is authorized as long
     as there is no opportunity for the item to become entrapped in a component, ground
     support and/or test equipment. These items are to be securely held in place to prevent
     any possibility of FO risk to the components being worked and must not pose any
     safety risk to the person wearing them. Supervision is responsible to monitor the
     wearing of badge, beret, hairpiece, hat, metal insignia, wig, etc. and may direct the
     removal of such items if it is believed such items are not securely held in place.
     Organization commanders may evaluate and prohibit metal insignias/badges in
     maintenance areas other than the flightline and must be listed in their respective
     supplemental guidance. This prohibition is to prevent any possibility of FOD risk to
     the components being worked and to reduce the safety risk to the person wearing
     them.
        14.19.2.6.1. (Added) Metal accoutrements/ insignias/ badges will not be worn in
        aircraft engine operation facilities or on trim pads. Refer to Refer to AFI 21-101
        OO-ALCSUP paragraph 14.19.2.5 with regards to restricted/controlled area
        badges or other officially issued badges/passes in AFI/TO identified critical intake
        areas.
        14.19.2.6.2. (Added) The wearing of wigs, hairpieces, metal hair fasteners,
        earrings, or any other jewelry, is not authorized to be worn while performing
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                                     23


           on/off equipment maintenance in designated FO critical areas. Aircraft engine
           run (excluding personnel who remain within the control/ monitoring cab at the
           test cell/ hush house facility) or launch team personnel will remove and secure all
           jewelry, badges, lanyards and loose pocket contents prior to performing any
           engine run tasks.
               14.19.2.6.2.1. (Added) While in “off equipment” maintenance areas, which
               are not designated as FO critical; wigs, hairpieces, metal hair fasteners,
               earrings, or any other jewelry must be securely held in place as to not pose
               any safety risk to the person wearing them, must not conflict with any
               established Air Force Instruction’s, and must not pose a possible FOD risk to
               the components being worked.
           14.19.2.6.3. (Added) The FOD awareness and prevention checklist for visiting
           personnel escorts is available, refer to OO-ALC QP management information
           system (i.e. SharePoint, etc.), FOD/DOP program.
       14.19.2.8. (Added) Vehicle FOD container must be secured in a manner which will
       not allow it to tip or overturn. A disposable bag may be used as a FOD container
       liner to ease with empting. This single disposable bag may remain in the container as
       long as it is apparent it is being used as a liner, thus the container shall meet the intent
       of being empty.
           14.19.2.9.1. (Added) While in work and/or in temporary storage, aircraft,
           uninstalled engines, AGE, and components thereof; will be monitored by the
           responsible supervisor in the applicable organization, to ensure security of covers
           and other associated caps/ plugs remain installed where applicable, and when a
           specific system or circuit is not actively being worked. Upon removing hardware
           from stock or a task kit, it will be placed in a positive closing container prior to it
           entering into an area which requires a secondary Production Acceptance
           Certification (PAC) for closure.
       14.19.2.10. (Added) An absorbent pad will not be used in or on aircraft or missiles
       unless a control measure, which will include documentation, to ensure its removal has
       been established and approved by the respective FOD FP and organizational
       leadership. Unless used to actively control or clean-up a hazardous waste spill (which
       has been reported to the applicable Alert/Control/Operations Center) absorbent pads
       will not be left unattended lying on the ground or in a drip pan on the airfield or
       outside in the industrial area.
       14.19.2.11. (Added) All organizations will identify their areas of responsibility
       (AOR): airfield/flightline, buildings occupied (to include the area out to 75 feet
       around the building), and portions of the designated industrial area (ramp and areas
       used as temporary storage/ parking).          Leadership within organizations with
       designated FO critical areas will ensure these areas are designated as Areas of
       Responsibility AORs for FOD walk purposes. All designated airfield/flightline
       AOR’s, under the stewardship of specific organizations, will have a FOD walk
       performed once a day (at a minimum, weather permitting, and only on designated
       duty days), prior to the first sortie/ maintenance engine run of each day. Airfield/
       flightline AOR’s will have a post high wind event (high wind events are determined,
24                          AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014


     notification sent out, and terminated by 75 Weather Squadron, through Complex
     Alert Center) FOD walk accomplished as soon after termination as practicable; to
     gather debris which may have been blown into the area and ensure the installation and
     security of aircraft plugs/covers/streamers and other dash 21 equipment (down gear).
     A FOD walk of the end-of-runway (EOR) inspection area will be conducted by the
     unit using it (assigned/tenant/TDY) prior to its first scheduled sortie (at a minimum)
     for that unit each day. FOD walks will be conducted, within all other designated FO
     critical areas weekly (at a minimum). Leadership will ensure assigned personnel
     participate in all scheduled FOD walks for their areas of responsibility to
     reduce/eliminate the potential for FO related incidents. An adequate amount of
     supervisory personnel will oversee each scheduled FOD walk to ensure overall
     participation and effectiveness. The frequency of any aforementioned FOD walks
     may be increased when directed by leadership as required to ensure cleanliness for
     housekeeping purposes. The weekly FOD walk does not negate the requirement for
     daily end-of-task and end-of-shift clean-ups in the immediate work areas. Monthly is
     the minimum FOD walk frequency for 309 AMARG designated industrial areas. The
     309 AMARG Executive Director (DD) or QP Director, or 576 ARMS/CL will
     determine and direct additional FOD walks as needed. The 309 AMARG FOD FP
     will assign FOD walk AORs. Assigned AMARG areas will be posted in the FOD
     continuity books. Changes to AMARG FOD walk AORs will be coordinated at the
     AMARG FOD meetings. When needed, updated AMARG AOR maps will be
     attached to the AMARG FOD meeting minutes. AMARG FOD FPs will update their
     own continuity book maps as required. Prior to the departure/arrival of an aircraft
     from 309 AMARG, leadership/ supervision will ensure an immediate area FOD check
     is accomplished on the portion of the flight line in which the aircraft will be arriving
     to or departing from. Mobile 2 and/or the escort vehicle will inspect the taxi route for
     FOD to and from the 309 AMARG/ Davis-Monthan Air Force Base gate for all
     arriving and departing aircraft. The 309 AMARG Follow-Me vehicle will also
     inspect the taxi route. Prior to any ground maintenance aircraft engine operation,
     management or supervision will ensure a FOD walk, in the immediate area around the
     aircraft, is accomplished by the responsible squadron. 309 AMARG Control will
     schedule the OO-ALC AMARG motorized sweeper through the support squadron to
     sweep the flight line, parking pads, trim pads and taxiways at least twice a week. For
     immediate FOD problems that cannot be taken care of by an individual, contact 309
     AMARG Control for the motorized sweeper, or QP-FP for the towable sweeper.
        14.19.2.11.1. (Added) Within 309 AMARG; a pre-tow FOD walk throughout
        the desert areas prior to a tow operation is impractical. The tow team supervisor
        will ensure the tow route is closely monitored during the tow and will halt the
        operation when a FOD hazard is observed. The FOD hazard will be eliminated or
        an alternate route selected before the tow will continue.
     14.19.2.12. (Added) Applicable group FOD FP will ensure communication has been
     established with the owning unit’s safety office/ FOD monitor to notify them of the
     initial findings within 24 hours. These points of contact names and organizational
     symbols will be provided to the OO-ALC FOD monitor when the initial report is sent.
     The applicable FOD FP will ensure communication has been established with the
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                                 25


       owning unit to inform them of the initial findings within 24 hours of all FOD
       discoveries occurring when an aircraft is in the process of the Programmed Depot
       Maintenance/ Functional Test process. As information becomes available, updates
       (to include the final report) will also be provided to the owning unit, and applicable
       customer support representative.
       14.19.2.13. (Added) Recommend units use a FO preventative cable with a swedge
       or similar item, in lieu of snap rings for items carried by pilots and aircrew members.
       Recommend all personal items (pencils, erasers, etc.) or professional equipment
       (maps, life support items, etc.) reported lost by aircrew members during aircraft
       operation (cockpit/ flight deck FO) be briefed during applicable FOD prevention
       briefings; to include the amount of time spent and maintenance required in the
       recovery of the item(s).
       14.19.2.14. (Added) All personnel, other than pilots and aircrew members, will
       remove all pocket contents before entering the aircraft cockpit or flight deck.
       Footwear of all personnel will be inspected for imbedded debris in the sole portion
       and any debris removed before entering the aircraft cockpit or flight deck. Aircrew
       members will ensure small loose items (items smaller than the standard pencil/ pen)
       are in pockets equipped with a method to ensure positive closure to prevent items
       from falling out. Recommend placing small items together in a small bag/container
       able to be closed before placing them in the pocket to create a redundant method of
       containment. The use of writing devices with the least amount of small items that
       could fall off (pocket clips, erasers covers etc.) is also recommended.
       14.19.2.15. (Added) Engine intake and exhaust areas, as well as a minimum of 25
       feet to the front and side of the intake, paying specific attention to panel seems and
       flight control surface gaps, which may conceal FO, will be inspected immediately
       prior to and after engine operation by the maintenance or launch crew assigned to the
       operation and in accordance with the airframe or engine-specific TO engine intake
       and exhaust inspection procedures.
       14.19.2.17. (Added) Designated entry points to the airfield (flightline) are identified
       with a combination stop sign, vehicle FOD checkpoint sign. (Ref. HILLAFBI 13-202
       Airfield vehicle Control)
          14.19.2.17.1. (Added) Vehicle operators which deposit dirt/ mud/ rocks onto the
          paved surface upon re-entry and are unable to eliminate the FOD hazard on the
          spot themselves will provide location of debris and request a vacuum sweeper
          through Airfield Management Operations (75 OSS/OSAM) either via base land
          mobile radio Tower net or phone (777-1861), Control Tower (75OSS/OSAT), or
          Complex Alert Center immediately. All flightline violations of this policy may
          result in revocation of flightline driving privileges by the Airfield Management.
          14.19.2.17.2. (Added) An FO inspection will occur on all items immediately
          prior to being towed which are already on the runway, taxiway, flightline, and in
          designated FO critical areas to include but not limited to AGE and aircraft.
          14.19.2.17.3. (Added) Aircraft tow operations which enter the designated
          airfield area will comply with a roll-over tire inspection at the point of entry like
26                       AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014


     any other vehicle. Prior to completion of the tow operation, a tire roll-over
     inspection will be performed as follows: 1) IAW applicable TO, 2) IAW local
     supplemental guidance, or 3) stop five feet short of the intended final location to
     inspect tires from all angles, accomplish final positioning, then inspect the
     previously unobserved portion of tires. All flightline violations of this policy may
     result in revocation of flightline driving privileges by the Airfield Management.
     14.19.2.17.4. (Added) Vehicle operators will ensure all debris/foreign objects
     are removed, and loose hand tools/tool attachments or loose hardware items are
     placed in a container while in the interior of the vehicle or any open cargo area
     prior to entering the flight line or industrial areas. This requirement also applies to
     all upper surface areas of towed equipment to ensure loose debris does not
     migrate or drop onto the flightline. Upon identifying any out of compliance
     vehicle, the driver of that vehicle shall immediately be directed to remove the
     vehicle from the area until corrected. All flightline violations of this policy may
     result in revocation of flightline driving privileges by the Airfield Management.
     14.19.2.17.5. (Added) Vehicles not engaged in providing direct mission support
     to aircraft maintenance or flightline/airfield operations will no longer travel the
     routes which traverse the East Ramp, Flight Test Ramp, North Ramp and along
     the shoulder of Taxiway Alpha between the air traffic control tower and the
     aircraft ramp adjacent to hanger 590. These are active flightline and airfield
     operation areas, and in accordance with AFI 13-213 Airfield Driving,
     commanders are asked to limit the number of personnel authorized on the
     flightline to an absolute minimum necessary to accomplish the mission. All
     flightline violations of this may result in revocation of flightline driving privileges
     by the Airfield Management.
     14.19.2.17.6. (Added) Whenever possible, vehicle operators on active taxiways
     will drive on/or adjacent to the shoulder, to minimize the FOD potential for
     operating aircraft; consult AFI 13-213 and any local supplemental airfield driving
     instruction for further guidance. Airfield Management, sweeper vehicles, and
     emergency response vehicles are excluded from this requirement.
     14.19.2.17.7. (Added) Recommend all personnel conduct a cursory post use
     inspection of snow removal equipment used on the airfield (SMV’s with push
     blades, small utility tractors with a snow blower or broom attachment, etc.) with a
     focus on items prone to vibrate loose or shear during use. If an item is discovered
     missing, immediately notify Airfield Management of the possibility that FO may
     exists in the area of the airfield which snow removal operations were conducted.
     Recommend 309 AMXG Transportation Flight personnel conduct a cursory post
     use inspection on large snow removal equipment driven in the industrial area with
     a focus on items prone to vibrate loose or shear during use. This inspection
     should be accomplished without delay upon arrival back to the equipment yard.
     Immediately notify Airfield Management and CE Snow Barn if the possibility
     exists that FO may migrate to the airfield via other snow removal efforts.
     Recommend a checklist be established for specific items on specific pieces of
     equipment.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                                27


          14.19.2.17.8. (Added) 309 AMXG leadership will ensure 309 AMXG owned
          pull-behind sweepers/ snow removal equipment with bristles, are not equipped
          with metal bristles.
          14.19.2.18.1. (Added) Recommend the cable lug nut on the bayonet end of
          aircraft grounding cables be routinely inspected for tightness and security to
          prevent FO.
          14.19.2.18.2. (Added) Tie down points will be kept clean and inspected during
          FOD walks as well.
       14.19.2.19. (Added) 309 AMXG will install bumper magnets on selected flight line
       accessible vehicles year-round, unless the safety office deems inclement weather has
       rendered the magnet a hazard or snow exceeds the ground clearance, at which time it
       may be removed. It is recommended 309 AMARG and 514 FLTS also implement the
       use of bumper mounted magnets. 309 AMXG transportation flight, 571st Aircraft
       Maintenance Squadron, 572nd Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, and 573rd Aircraft
       Maintenance Squadron supervisors will determine the vehicles under their
       stewardship which travel the flightline the majority of the time. One vehicle from
       each squadron (two from Transportation flight) will be selected to have a bumper
       mounted magnet fitted and installed. Leadership may request additional magnets for
       other vehicles; however, each of the above mentioned squadrons will ensure at least
       one magnet, transportation will have two, are serviceable and in use. Magnets will be
       cleaned, as well as inspected, for excessive wear and cracks; at which time they will
       be replaced. Recommend items gathered by the magnets be collected for analysis by
       the group FOD FP.
       14.19.2.20. (Added) The FO removal tool will be added to the vehicle’s AF Form
       1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble report, for inventory purposes. Any
       item removed from a vehicle tire will be properly collected and disposed of, not left
       lying on the ground. This eliminates the potential for the item to continue to migrate.
       The operator of any vehicle driven on the airfield/ flightline during periods of
       darkness or that passes through vehicle tire FOD checkpoints without adequate
       lighting will ensure an operational illuminating device is available to accomplish the
       tire FOD inspection. If an illuminating device is kept in the vehicle as part of the
       vehicle equipment, it will be marked with the vehicle ID and added to the vehicle’s
       AF Form 1800 for inventory purposes. Airfield Management is not responsible to
       provide lighting at airfield/ flightline vehicle FOD checkpoints. Direct questions or
       concerns about the location or condition of airfield (flightline) vehicle FOD
       checkpoints to 75 Operational Support Squadron (OSS) Airfield Management
       Operations Section (777-3592).
       14.19.2.22. (Added) Organizations with possession of an Aeroprobe-type magnetic
       tool location device are encouraged to share the device with the other organizations
       on base to facilitate the magnetizing process and make the wand device available to
       aid with lost tool searches.
          14.19.2.23.1. (Added) Initial FOD/ (DO as applicable) briefing will be made
          part of the Job Safety Training Outline and incorporated during the initial
          orientation work center briefing. This briefing is required for all personnel who
28                        AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014


        accomplish on-equipment or off-equipment maintenance tasks in the performance
        of their assigned duties. The initial FOD/DO briefing will be documented either
        on the employees applicable AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record
        (refer to AFI 91-202, Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, the integrated
        maintenance data system [IMDS], or AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard
        Continuation/ Command JQS, of the 623 folder, Individual Training Record).
        Supervisors will brief work area-specific FOD/DO prevention techniques
        procedures and requirements. Reminder, this initial FOD/DO briefing is required
        for individuals who are TDY, transferred, or loaned from other units prior to
        beginning work in the area as well and will have to be documented separately
        from their previous initial FOD/DO briefing.
        14.19.2.23.2. (Added) All personnel who accomplish on-equipment/ off-
        equipment maintenance tasks in the performance of their assigned duties will
        have a quarterly FOD/DO awareness and prevention briefing provided to them.
        At a minimum, supervisors will use Hill AFB FOD Prevention Committee
        Meeting minutes, as information for the quarterly briefing. The Hill AFB FOD
        Prevention Committee Meeting minutes will be available on the maintenance
        information system (MIS) under FOD/DOP Program (contact your FOD FP for
        assistance). An AFMC Form 316, Supervisors Safety Meeting Minutes will be
        used as the locally developed roster for organizations to document attendance at
        the quarterly FOD briefings. Quarterly FOD/DO briefings must be mentioned as
        its own line item on the form. The form will have the typed/ written names of all
        employees assigned so the spelling of the names is distinguishable. Employees
        will sign/ initial next to their name to verify attendance. Supervisors will
        maintain, at a minimum, the most recent years’ worth (four quarters) of FOD/DO
        quarterly briefing material and attendance rosters. All other personnel (besides
        those who accomplish on-equipment/off-equipment maintenance tasks) who are
        merely required to pass through a maintenance area to perform their assigned
        duties, are not required to have a quarterly briefing provided to them, but must
        accomplish initial and the applicable refresher FOD Prevention training. All
        supervisors should closely track employees absent at the time of the quarterly
        briefing and provide the material to them upon returning to duty. Supervisors
        may send the briefing material electronically to absent employees and use a reply
        from them indicating they have read the provided briefing material as an
        electronic signature. The reply will then be attached to that quarter’s original
        AFMC Form 316 for which they were indicated as absent.
     14.19.2.26. (Added) All personnel are empowered and responsible to monitor
     facility areas for items that could be a potential FOD hazard, and use bags when
     possible to secure all trash before placing it in dumpsters. Every effort should be
     given to ensure dumpster lids are closed. Dumpsters should also be positioned
     opposite to the direction of prevailing winds whenever possible. Excess trash which
     may keep the dumpster lid from closing should be placed into the next available
     dumpster. Address potential FOD hazards and trash/ dumpster concerns to the
     applicable facility manager.
        14.19.2.26.1. (Added) Keeping dumpster lids closed is particularly important in
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                              29


          the maintenance and industrial areas immediately adjacent to the flightline,
          taxiway, and airfield. To reduce the possibility of loose and blowing items which
          may be fastened together with staples, paper clips or other devices from migrating
          out onto the airfield, no dumpster or recycle container is allowed into the
          industrial area without a serviceable lid.
       14.19.2.27. (Added) Personnel will report all potential FOD conditions to an
       immediate supervisor for further action, when such conditions cannot be corrected on
       the spot.
          14.19.3.2.2. (Added) FOD FPs; refer to paragraph 14.19.5.1 of this

        include small turbine engines) will initially be reported as a FOD incident
        (unless caused by the natural environment or wildlife) until the investigation
        (to include forensic sampling) substantiates otherwise. Damage determined to
        have been caused by a workmanship discrepancy will be considered as a
        contributing factor to a FOD incident, not material failure.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                                 31


              14.19.4.5.10.7. (Added) FOD FPs will review continuity books at least
              annually to ensure supplements and FOD program documents are current.
              14.19.4.5.10.8. (Added) FOD/DOP (where applicable) FPs will review their
              applicable quality data base monthly for trends, repeat occurrences indicating
              an area of concern or programmatic issues and will ensure they are reported to
              the applicable Group/Squadron Commander/Director for review along with a
              recommended corrective and preventative action.
                14.19.4.5.10.9.2. (Added) FOD FPs may maintain cross reference sheets in
                place of printing hard copies of material in the established continuity book.
       14.19.5.1. (Added) When a FO incident is discovered, the responsible supervisor
       will provide sufficient information needed to complete the appropriate report form
       (consult FOD FP for current form). Do not delay submitting the initial notification as
       there is a HQ AFMC mandated 24-hour suspense from the time of discovery that the
       command FOD manager be notified. Each employee is empowered and required to
       report all FOD incidents/ damage to their immediate supervisor as soon as
       practicable. Supervisors will also notify their leadership. The FOD FPs will
       coordinate with supervision/leadership for necessary support and/ or personnel during
       FOD incident investigations. Involve the respective safety office as soon as an
       incident is determined a MISHAP, refer to AFMC SUP1 paragraph 14.19.10
          14.19.5.1.1. (Added) Commanders/directors/deputies will ensure appropriate
          personnel are provided adequate time required to conduct/support FOD
          investigations. When a confirmed FOD event occurs with turbine or jet engines
          and the damage is beyond repairable limits established in the applicable technical
          order, a forensic sample will be collected. The sample from the damaged area
          will be preserved in the event it is required to be processed by a metallurgy
          laboratory to aid in the investigation. Samples will be taken by group or engine
          shop personnel trained in collecting FOD forensic samples. The sample will be
          taken when the damage is readily accessible and does not require disassembly
          beyond the scope of the organization’s capability to gain access to the damaged
          area. In this instance, when an asset is required to be sent to a repair and overhaul
          facility not associated with the OO-ALC, a request to obtain a forensic sample
          will accompany the asset. Forensic samples will be placed in the damaged asset’s
          serialized historical records file/folder. The forensic sample will be placed in a
          sealed envelope marked “Foreign Object Damage Forensic Evidence - Do Not
          Open Unless to Process.” An aircraft engine sample will be maintained as part of
          the engine data file/folder.
       14.19.5.6. (Added) When the report is submitted, a courtesy copy will be sent via e-
       mail to the originating FOD (/ DOP where applicable) FP and any personnel/
       organization mail address designated by HQ AFMC FOD/ DOP manager or the Hill
       AFB FOD/DOP manager. FOD/DOP) FPs will provide monthly updates to all
       ongoing reports to the their next higher level FOD/DOP) FP in their organization no
       later than the 15th day of the new month. The updates will then be provided to the
       Hill AFB FOD monitor. Group FOD FPs will provide known information, reference

        sample analysis results.
            14.19.5.6.1. (Added) When an investigation is completed, the group FOD FP
            will compose the final report, reference Attachment 12 of AFI 21-101 for format.
            For all FOD incidents which occur to contracted aircraft/components, the
            applicable group FOD FP will supply a copy of the initial FOD report and
            subsequent investigation updates to the Prime Vendor FOD POC. When the
            damaged asset is contractor owned or being worked IAW a partnership agreement
            between the government and a contractor, OO-ALC Contract Management Office
            and Public Affairs Offices (PAO) will be contacted to assist with ensuring the
            initial and subsequent reports are sterilized prior to release to the contractor or
            otherwise outside of government channels. Some contracts are let above the OO-
            ALC level so request the OO-ALC Contract Management Office assist to
            determine the proper contract office which needs to be communicated with to
            facilitate the review and sterilization of information before release.
               14.19.5.6.1.1. (Added) The OO-ALC FOD monitor will assign control
               numbers for OO-ALC incidents.
        14.19.5.7. (Added) Flying hours will be figured by multiplying the number of
        engines in operations by the timeframe stated; as each engine in operation has the
        same potential to have a FOD incident occur while it is in operation. Each MISHAP
        has an effect on the FOD rate; and FOD FPs will ensure their respective safety
        representative is notified when FOD incidents are determined to have met the
        MISHAP reporting requirements of AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
     14.19.6. (Added) Aircraft maintenance squadrons within OO-ALC will assist their
     respective group FOD FP by gathering the following data so it may be provided to the
     OO-ALC FOD monitor no later than the 15th work day of every month (for the previous
     month) to assist with calculating the wing’s FOD rate; total hours of Functional Check
     Flights (FCF) by mission design series (MDS), and total hours of engine operating time
     accumulated during maintenance ground runs by MDS, total hours of engine operating
     time accumulated during un-installed (test cell) engine runs.
            14.19.6.1.18. (Added) All customer-reported FO/FOD will be reported by the
            applicable weapon system specific customer support specialist through written
            media (e-mail) to the 309 AMXG FOD FP. This information is used to analyze
            FOD trends and coordinate prevention methods and is reported quarterly at the
            Hill AFB FOD Prevention Committee Meeting. Customer-reported FOD-related
            Deficiency Reports (DRs) will be included in the applicable OO-ALC quality
            performance indicators and briefed to leadership officials.
     14.19.7. (Added) When a bird strike is discovered, aircraft maintenance personnel will
     ensure the remains are not disturbed prior to the arrival of the investigation team,
     Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) representative or, a Safety representative.
     These remains provide vital information to aid the BASH program in gathering data for
     trend analysis and should be properly collected for analysis.

        acquired equipment manuals maintained by the RCC. If the manual has a T.O.
        number assigned, turn the manual over to the Government T.O. Library POC so this
        POC can notify the appropriate contract TODO personnel to add the T.O. to the
        library and update T.O. records.
        14.41.10.4. (Added) Establishes and maintains a COTS library for manuals not
        requiring a T.O. number. Location of the library will be locally determined; however,
        every effort should be made to locate the library in close proximity to existing T.O.
        libraries so there is no question as to the availability of the manuals. The COTS
        library must be accessible to all who use the equipment. Ensures COTS manuals are
        numbered to maintain positive control and filed in numerical and/or alphabetical
        sequence. Numbering will be locally determined and will be consistent throughout
        the group.

            shall have a list of effected page (LEP) check. Annotate completion of LEP on
            COTS title page or LEP with the date, reviewer initials. Page checks are required
            for brief manuals or COTS manuals without LEPs and need to be documented
            with date and reviewer initials.
            14.41.10.6.2. (Added) Add any new COTS manuals to master COTS listings
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                                     49


             ensuring new COTS manuals are numbered.
             14.41.10.6.3. (Added) Annual technical review shall be documented on the first

         working days or at the request of the COTS POC.
         14.41.10.8. (Added) AFMC Form 561, Process Order, will be developed to
         establish procedures for equipment operations where COTS manuals are not available
         or inadequate IAW AFI 21-101 AFMC_SUP Chapter 19.
  14.42. (Added) OO-ALC Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Control Program. The primary
  purpose of this program is to establish, describe, and assign specific responsibilities and
  procedures for an ESD Control Program within the OO-ALC. This program identifies
  operating procedures that apply to all employees assigned to OO-ALC who handle
  Electrostatic Discharge Sensitive items and will minimize ESD damage to
  electrical/electronic parts, assemblies, and equipment repaired, tested, operated, stored, and
  transported within OO-ALC. It is intended to supplement existing ESD control guidance
  through reference and by providing basic procedures where none currently exist. Also
  provides supplemental information to support TO 00-25-234, General Shop Practice
  Requirements for the Repair, Maintenance, and Test of Electrical Equipment, Section VII,
  Electrostatic Discharge Control, takes precedence over all referenced standards and
  handbooks. This instruction supports the OO-ALC quality systems.
     14.42.1. (Added) Background. Static electricity is an electrical charge at rest. The
     electrical charge is due to the transfer of electrons within a body or from one body to
     another. The magnitude of the charge depends on the size, shape, composition, and
     electrical properties that make up the bodies. The electrical charge can be changed when
     two substances are rubbed together, separated, or flow relative to one another. The
     voltage level can reach as high as 35KV (kilovolt) for a human being. The discharge of
     this voltage potential and electrostatic field is considered detrimental to today’s electrical
     and electronic devices. A discharge from a human being or materials can possess current
     values of 1-50A. Some of today’s circuits are sensitive to voltage as low as 25 volts.
     The approximate level of voltage for a human being to feel a static discharge is 3,500
     volts. Therefore, personnel can do damage to devices without feeling it themselves.
     14.42.2. (Added) Responsibilities.
         14.42.2.1. (Added) Group commanders/directors will:
             14.42.2.1.1. (Added) Appoint a primary and alternate group ESD Control
             Program Manager in writing to the OO-ALC ESD Program Manager.

            deficiencies. Results will be posted in the work area or in a readily accessible
            ESD program file once the survey is completed. Annual surveys will be
            accomplished on the anniversary date of the previous annual survey or when
            area requirements have changed.
            14.42.8.2.5.3. (Added) Notify squadron ESD POC within 10 working days
            when changes are made to existing areas or additional work areas are required
            to ensure an ESD Control Report of Annual Survey is re-accomplished. A
            new ESD area survey is not required for minor changes; pen and ink changes
            are authorized. Results will be forwarded to the group ESD manager within
            30 days any time changes or new requirements are introduced to the work area
            and then posted within the work area or in a readily accessible ESD program
            file. The next annual survey will contain the changes and new requirements
            within the annual written report.
            14.42.8.2.5.4. (Added) Ensure ESD work surfaces (stations) are tested

        following are the requirements for control of technical data extracts: The
        technical data title page will be printed, dated and stamped with a maintenance
        stamp and required pages from the technical data will be attached and/or in a
        binder under the specific technical data title page. Personnel not assigned a
        maintenance stamp will legibly print their first name initial and last name on the
        technical data title page. The required pages from technical data will be attached
        and/or placed in a binder under the technical data title page. Extended use
        extracts will be reviewed for currency minimally every 30 calendar days. If the
        extract is needed longer than 30 calendar days, line out the old date and write the
        date of the new check on the technical data title page.
        19.1.1.1.4. (Added) If multiple extracts are required they can be placed into a
        binder with an index sheet. The index sheet will be maintained in the front of the
        binder and will identify all the technical data extract numbers contained within the
        binder. The index sheet will be stamped and dated showing required currency
        review checks of the documents contained within the binder. There is no need to
        stamp and date each extract maintained within the extract binder. If a technical
        data extract is removed from the binder that extract will be again reviewed and
        stamped and dated per paragraph 19.1.1.1.3
        19.1.1.1.5. (Added) Printed technical data extract will also contain a required

     19.2.10. (Added) Approved OO-ALC WCDs are: AFMC Form 173, MDS/Project
     Operation Assignment, AFMC Form 959, Work Control Document, IMPRESA, ITS,
     MAXIMO, Programmed Depot Maintenance Scheduling System (PDMSS) computer
     generated AFMC Form 173, over and above (O&A) unplanned/unpredictable WCDs
     generated from a maintenance work request (MWR), and definitized lists when attached
     to an AFMC FORM 173.
        19.2.10.1. (Added) FEMS shall be utilized by Plant Management (309 MXSS) to
        create a computer generated Work Authorization Document (WAD) for called in
        problems and scheduled maintenance. Review of all Job Plans used to create Work
        Authorization Documents (WAD's) will be accomplished by QA, Engineering, and
        applicable RCC technicians every three years. Certified employees shall stamp on
        the employee work completion line when the WAD is completed. Prior to closing out
        the WAD, the supervisor or designated employee will input the certifying employee’s
        information into FEMS. FEMS shall also be utilized by the PMEL (709 MXSS) to
        generate calibration and/or repair work orders for the scheduling of TMDE.
        Completed work orders will be ‘K’ stamped by the technician who is certified to
        perform the work. The completed work order shall be routed to PMEL Production
        Control for entry into the FEMS data base. Historical tracking of all certifying
        employees shall be maintained in FEMS.
           19.2.10.1.1. (Added) Employees stamping WAD documents shall ensure stamps
           and date impressions are legible. Informational notes shall be used as required
           and IAW AFI21-101_AFMCSUP and this supplement when any WAD (work
           authorization document) task/operations is NR (not required), NA (not
           applicable), PCW (previously complied with or SAI (satisfactory as is).
        19.2.10.2. (Added) All I-coded tasks shall be performed in the sequence they appear
        on the WCD. At no time shall an I-coded task be skipped over to perform another
        dependent sub-operation task. The following is a scenario for clarification: An
        AFMC Form 173 card states rig flight controls and the attached definitized list
        identifies two independent tasks with critical but independent sub-operations that are
        I-coded (1) rigging left flight controls and (2) rigging right flight controls. In
        scenarios such as this the I-codes can be stamped out of sequence because they are
        totally independent ‘major’ tasks with independent sub-operations.
        19.2.10.3. (Added) 309 AMARG Work Order Request: The AFMC Form 173;
        MDS/Project Operation Assignment, (Maintenance Work Request (MWR)) hard copy
        or electronic version will be routed through planning for unpredictable/unplanned
        tasks. The initiating and/or performing RCC technician will ‘M’ stamps and dates
        legibly the AFMC Form 173 on the upper left hand corner of field #31. The verifying
        production supervisor or designee (and/or performing RCC supervisor or designee, if
        applicable) will ‘P’ stamps and dates legibly the AFMC Form 173 on the upper right
        hand corner of field #31, annotate and/or validate the PAC code required for the
        WCD operation. The production supervisor or designee will forward the AFMC Form
        173 to the planner for processing. The planner will input the data from the AFMC
        Form 173 into MAXIMO and generate an automated WCD. The planner will forward
        the WCD to the project scheduler so the unplanned and over & above (O&A)
        workload may be added to the schedule.

                19.2.10.3.1. (Added) PDMSS-generated O&A unpredictable/unplanned. The
                PDMSS-generated O&A WCD is initiated by a technician who identifies
                (stumbles-on) a defect and hand scribes the defect onto a PDMSS maintained
                work request worksheet when the defect is not covered by any Evaluations and
                Inspection (E&I) write up.
                   19.2.10.3.1.1. (Added) 309 AMARG Scheduler receives unplanned and over
                   & above WCDs from planning and incorporates workload into project
                   schedules. 309 AMARG will not use AFMC Form 173 as a WCD for the
                   repair and certification of maintenance work. See Table 19.1 for instructions
                   on completing the PDMSS work request worksheet.

              scribe all defects noted in the WCD list any defects area within the task
              description block or make a note within the LIST ANY DEFECTS
              DETECTED area see attached NDI report or technical data identified NDI
              defect capture log for defect findings. If feasible, the NDI technician can
              mark all part defect areas. The NDI technician shall stamp and date the
              inspection certification code block.
              19.2.14.2.2.2. (Added) If no defects are noted the NDI technician shall hand
              scribe the following or equivalent statement in LIST ANY DEFECTS
              DETECTED area ‘No Defects Noted’. The NDI technician shall stamp and
              date the inspection certification code block.
              19.2.14.2.2.3. (Added) An NDI technician supporting aircraft NDI
              requirements finding deficiencies will submit an MWR for defects discovered
              during NDI processing. For NDI noted deficiencies not addressed and/or
              outside the limits of the technical data, a tail number specific AFMC Form
              202 will be submitted IAW the procedures of paragraph 19.2.4.2.3 and
              supporting sub-paragraphs. The approved AFMC Form 202 shall be annotated
              and attached to the O&A WCD IAW paragraph. 19.2.4.2 and supporting
              sub-paragraphs of this supplement. NOTE: All WCDs containing NDI tasks
              shall be updated per the above paragraphs and sample figure within two years
              of this supplements published date. NOTE: Performance of WCD identified
              NDI tasks are a process inspection and as a result should not be considered
              always a defect free inspection.

           19.2.15. (Added) As required, a technician can manually record measurements taken
           during maintenance processes onto the WCD within the task description block.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                                     71


     19.2.16. (Added) The following management codes (MGT/CD) are authorized for use
     on       OO-ALC Complex WCDS. ‘C’ is used to indicate the WCD task requires a
     scheduler’s review of completed WCD for accuracy, completeness of stamping and other
     WCD documentation requirements. ‘P’ is used to indicate the WCD task requires a
     supervisor's review of completed WCD for accuracy, completeness of stamping and other
     WCD documentation requirements. The MGT/CD ‘SP’ (secondary PAC) is used to
     indicate the WCD task is critical and requires dual certification with either an ‘E’ or ‘I’ in
     the PAC/CD block. Rational eliminates specifying only used on ITS and IMPRESA
     WCDs allows use on all WCDs.
        19.2.16.1. (Added) Any WCD task having an assigned inspection/certification code
        to include management code shall be stamped and dated when completed. Any
        production supervisor certifying an actual WCD identified maintenance process or
        task will meet the same training, qualification, and certification requirements as the
        PAC certified employee and will require a PAC record.
            19.2.16.1.1. (Added) 309 AMARG a P-stamp will not be used to certify
            completion of maintenance accomplished on a task or product.
        19.2.16.2. (Added) Critical maintenance processes and critical maintenance tasks
        identified as In Accordance With (IAW) require the technician to have technical data
        open and in use. This means the technician has reviewed procedures, warnings,
        cautions, and notes for the maintenance process or maintenance task before starting
        the job. The technician has the approved technical data open to the applicable
        process or task in work. The technician performing the process or task will be able to
        point to the exact step being accomplished in the technical data but need not be on the
        exact page when approached.
        19.2.16.3. (Added) PPT and appointed group process engineer shall thoroughly
        review all technical data ensuring identification of maintenance processes.
        Maintenance processes are reviewed by group process engineers who in turn, as
        required, develop process orders ensuring requirements called out in technical data
        governing these processes are developed specifically for like end items undergoing
        depot overhaul. Maintenance processes in technical data are considered treatment
        and/or preparation processes. For example, heating, baking, welding, non-destructive
        process methods, cold working processes such as shot peening, high velocity oxygen
        flame spray, chemical cleaning, chrome plating, anodizing, alodining, etc. The PPT
        and group process engineer shall determine if a maintenance process is critical and
        requires secondary certification on the WCD. The appointed group process engineer
        will respond to the PPT when an actual WCD maintenance process is being
        identified/reviewed/changed/updated etc., including if the WCD identifies a process
        order. The group process engineer shall coordinate and sign off on the AFMC Form
        500, Work Control Document Production Planning Team Checklist. When the group
        process engineer and PPT can’t determine if an identified maintenance process not
        identified by a warning or caution is deemed critical and requires secondary
        certification, the planner shall contact the supply chain manager (SCM) engineering
        authority (EA) for assistance. The planner shall ensure when contacting the SCM EA
        a documentation audit trail from the SCM EA is captured. The planner can request
        the SCM EA sign the AFMC Form 500. Minimally if the SCM EA signature isn’t
72                          AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014


     obtained, the planner shall ensure an audit trail of documentation from the SCM EA
     is attached to, or included on the AFMC Form 500. Maintenance processes not
     clearly defined in technical data shall have an AFMC Form 202 submitted to the
     SCM EA.
     19.2.16.4. (Added) PPT shall thoroughly review all required technical data ensuring
     identification of IAW tasks and critical maintenance processes and critical
     maintenance tasks requiring secondary certification on WCDs. When the PPT can’t
     determine if an identified maintenance task not identified by a warning or caution is
     deemed critical and requires secondary certification the Planner shall contact the
     SCM EA for assistance. The Planner shall ensure when contacting the SCM EA a
     documentation audit trail from the SCM EA is captured. The Planner can request the
     SCM EA sign the AFMC Form 500. Minimally, if the SCM EA signature isn’t
     obtained the Planner shall ensure an audit trail of documentation from the SCM EA is
     attached to or included on the AFMC Form 500. All critical tasks covered by tech
     data shall have tech data identified as IAW on the WCD. PPT determined critical
     tasks not covered by technical data will contain the following or equivalent statement,
     “Technical Data Not Required” within the task description block.
     19.2.16.4.1. (Added) The following provides minimum requirements the PPT will
     use to identify WCD IAW processes and tasks including identification of critical
     process and tasks requiring secondary certification on WCDs:
            19.2.16.4.1.1. (Added) Use of tech data identified as ‘Preliminary’ all
            associated tasks will be identified as IAW.
            19.2.16.4.1.2. (Added) The WCD operation identifies a secondary
            certification of ‘I’. The FO inspection should not be identified as ‘IAW’
            unless the technical data specifically requires the performance of a FO
            inspection and then this FO task shall be identified as IAW.
            19.2.16.4.1.3. (Added) The WCD operation requires a ‘critical’
            measurement be taken to determine serviceability, ensure proper assembly or
            are required in order to proceed to the next step in repair or test process will
            be identified as IAW.
            19.2.16.4.1.4. (Added) The WCD operation requires critical ‘specific’ torque
            requirements in order to assemble or test an item. Example: Torque of a
            panel fastener or clamp bolt is a general torque while the torque on a bearing
            retaining nut is a ‘specific’ torque will be identified as IAW.
            19.2.16.4.1.5. (Added) The WCD operations are identified as ‘Tasks Must
            be Accomplished and Certified in Step-By-Step Order’ will be identified as
            IAW.
            19.2.16.4.1.6. (Added) The WCD operation involves critical assembly,
            installation, inspection, repair, rigging, functional/operational testing, etc., of
            munitions, rocket motor, life support system, egress system, aircraft canopy,
            landing gear, aircraft engine and components of aircraft engines, aircraft
            auxiliary power systems, aircraft gearboxes, aircraft flight control surfaces,
            aircraft hydraulic and fuel components.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                               73


              19.2.16.4.1.7. (Added) Other criteria that can be used to identify WCD tasks
              as IAW are the WCD operation with chronic: (1) rework issues, (2)
              deficiency reports, (3) quality assessment rating (QAR) of three (QAR-3), and
              (4) quality verification inspections rated QAR-3.
              19.2.16.4.1.8. (Added) All WCD FO/Rag inspections will be coded with
              either an ‘E’ or ‘I’ inspection certification code.
       19.2.16.6. (Added) When the WCD operation identifies critical maintenance
       process or task (secondary in-process certification) performed by a team, the team
       chief will brief all team members on safety requirements prior to process or task
       initiation. In cases of incomplete work at shift change, sufficient documentation will
       be provided by the off-going shift supervisor or wage leader to ensure the work, when
       continued, will not require unnecessary re-accomplishment of previous processes or
       tasks. Processes or tasks on the WCD not completed due to shift change will be
       annotated as follows:
          19.2.16.6.1. (Added) The off-going supervisor or wage leader will describe the
          completed work in an established log book identifying the WCD operation or
          production control number (PDN), job order number (JON) and specific WCD
          operation or sub-operation. The technician who subsequently completes the
          process or task will certify completion by properly stamping and dating the WCD
          task in the appropriate certification block.
          19.2.16.6.2. (Added) If the follow-on technician is unable to appraise the work
          already completed the shift supervisor or wage leader will determine how to
          proceed.
          19.2.16.6.3. (Added) When definitized lists are used to document tasks
          accomplished by more than one individual, the individual certifying the source
          AFMC Form 173 is stating that the operations he/she performed on the definitized
          list were done correctly and all other operations on the definitized list are
          stamped/dated. The source AFMC Form 173 should be M-coded.
          19.2.16.6.4. (Added) For 309 AMARG on team task certifications, the person
          designated as team leader will ensure all tasks have been completed, stamped and
          dated legibly on the WCD.
          19.2.16.6.5. (Added) 309 AMARG. When a task is not completed (i.e., end of a
          shift, AWP, etc.), the technician will document the partial completion using
          ‘Notes on Back’ procedures in paragraph 19.3.5.1.2 The technician who
          subsequently completes the task will certify completion by properly stamping and
          dating legibly the WCD task in the appropriate certification block.
          19.2.16.7.1. (Added) 309 AMARG: When upgrading inspection/certification
          code, the supervisor and planner will enter a reason for the upgrade of the
          inspection/certification code using the ‘Notes on Back’ procedures in paragraph
          19.3.5.1.2, and both the supervisor and planner shall stamp and date this
          information. If this is a permanent change the supervisor will initiate an AFMC
          Form 957.

            19.2.16.7.2. (Added) A QAS may add a Q code above block 29 of the AFMC
            Form 173 or in the Other/Insp (third column) of the definitized list. On the
            AFMC Form 959 the QAS may add a Q in block 20, third column identified with
            a Q. On an ITS equivalent WCD, to the right of the current certification code
            block the QAS will manually enter an inspection certification code block entering
            a Q inside the block. All Q entries will be done in Red. The QAS will affix a
            stamp and date next to the manually entered Q code on the applicable WCD and
            an informational note as to the reason. Upon completion of the evaluation the
            QAS shall stamp and date the manually entered Q code. Only a QAS is
            authorized to stamp or enter Not Inspected (NI) stamping and dating the NI on a
            Q coded WCD operation or sub-operation.
            19.2.16.7.3. (Added) Downgrades to Inspection/Certification Codes.              No
            process or task with an inspection/certification code of E or I will be downgraded.
            Downgrades to maintenance processes shall require coordination and approval
            through quality and Process Engineering organizations. Downgrades to
            maintenance task shall require coordination and approval through quality
            organization and SCM EA. Any downgrade to an inspection certification code
            shall require mandatory documentation and coordination of the AFMC Form 500
            through quality, Process Engineering and/or the SCM EA.
                19.2.16.7.3.1. (Added) 309 AMARG:             The planner and production
                supervisor will not date and stamp above the inspection block. The date and
                justification for the change will be annotated on the back of the WCD using
                the ‘Notes on Back’ procedures in paragraph 19.3.5.1.2
                19.2.16.7.3.2. (Added) 309 AMARG will use the date                       format
                YYYYMMDD (ex: 20120718) when stamping and dating the WCD.
     19.2.17. (Added) Handwritten ops on WCDs for items in work. If a new operation is
     required for WCDs on the shop floor the supervisor shall contact the planner and the new
     operation shall be entered in red by the planner. This entry shall contain an informational
     note stating the reason for the new operation. This entry shall be stamped and dated by
     both the planner and production supervisor. If this is a permanent change for all like
     items the supervisor shall initiate an AFMC Form 957. A thorough review of paragraph
     19.2.16.2 through paragraph 19.2.16.4. and supporting sub-paragraphs will be done.
     19.2.18. (Added) 309 AMARG. When all routed operations are complete, the
     technician will close the operations in Workplace, stamp and date the WCD router, and
     return the asset and router WCD to the project scheduler or designated drop-off area. The
     project scheduler will attach the router WCD to the core WCD for audit and tracking
     purposes. The router WCD will be referenced on the core WCD for each routed operation
     by entering “Carried Forward to attached router WCD” in Block 17, or use Notes on
     Back procedures. NOTE: Routers generated as a separate sub-WCD to the core will not
     have corresponding operations on the core, and will be maintained in its own file under
     that core WCD. No reference on the core WCD is required.
        19.2.18.1. (Added) 309 AMARG. Items condemned during the routed maintenance
        process will be identified with a DD Form 1577, Unserviceable (Condemned) Tag
        Materiel. The technician will enter “Condemned” in the task description block of the
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                                  75


        specific operation being accomplished, and on the first page of the router WCD. The
        item will be returned to the originating workcenter for disposition and requisition of a
        replacement asset. The router WCD for the condemned asset will be returned to the
        project scheduler, and referenced on the core WCD using ‘Note on Back’ procedures.
        All unaccomplished operations will be identified as “Not Required”, with an entry in
        the ‘Scheduler’s notes’ that the asset was condemned. A new router WCD will be
        generated if the replacement asset requires the same routed work. The new WCD
        will be generated as a ‘child’ of the original router WCD, with any operations not
        required on the new asset entered as ‘Not Required’. For operations that must be re-
        accomplished on the new asset, an entry will be made in the scheduler’s notes
        “previous asset condemned”. Base hours for each required operation of the child
        WCD will remain the same as the original and captured in the core hours.
     19.2.18.2. (Added) All WCDs associated with aircraft depot maintenance will be
     physically/individually accounted for and placed in aircraft dead file prior to aircraft
     delivery.
        19.2.18.3. (Added) 309 AMXG will document non-production crash damage repair
        aircraft maintenance actions using AFTO Form 781 series and/or AFMC Form 959.
     19.2.19. (Added) 309 AMXG rework is defined as all labor hours expended and/or
     material utilized to correct nonconforming conditions (damage) caused as a result of
     maintenance actions, or lack of action, while an asset (end item, weapon system,
     subsystem, or any part thereof, etc.,) is under 309 AMXG control. The labor hours
     expended to correct ‘organically caused’ deficiencies fall under the category of rework.
        19.2.19.1. (Added) A stamped and dated informational note will be included in the
        task description block indicating an item must be reworked. See Figure 19.5

Figure 19.5. (Added) Rework Documentation




         19.2.19.2. (Added) Flight Test Rework. If flight test discovers a problem suspected
         to be rework, the responsible scheduler and planner will email the appropriate
         production supervisor or designee and scheduler a description of the discrepancy and
         courtesy copy the PAO. The production supervisor or designee will research the
         suspected discrepancy. If the supervisor or designee determines that it is rework they
         will “Reply to All” in original email, provide the responsible scheduler and planner
         with the operation number suspected of causing the rework and a rework MWR will
         be submitted and a O&A WCD generated and approved for 0.1 hours. The following
         statement will be entered in the planners dispute block “REWORK Operation
         Number (OP) OPXXXXX”. If the supervisor or designee determines it is not rework
         they will notify the responsible scheduler and planner that the discrepancy was an
         incoming condition and an MWR is submitted and an O&A WCD generated and
         approved for time. The following will be entered in the planner's dispute
         “INCOMING CONDITION”. Depending on the severity of the discrepancy, it may
         be entered in the AFTO 781 series forms and carried to home station.
         19.2.19.3. (Added) 309 AMARG. Report of Discrepancy (ROD): When the 577
         CMRS receives a ROD that a wrong part was sent to a customer and it is determined
         that the fault lies with 309 AMARG, rework procedures will be as follows. Obtain
         the original completed WCD, create a new rework WCD (child) and link it to the
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                                77


       parent WCD that caused the rework, copy required tasks from the parent WCD and
       man-hour accountability charged to “rework” work category. See paragraph
       19.2.19.4.2 for more rework instructions. When the part in question is returned to
       309 AMARG, the responsible reclamation planner will ensure part is returned to the
       aircraft it was removed from or process into storage using AMARG IMT 22,
       Components/Items Missing and/or Removed from Aircraft by the 309th Support
       Squadron (SPTS). The status of the part on the removal item listing (C03) will be
       changed to storage account or return to aircraft by reversing the ‘L’ code transaction.
       19.2.19.4. (Added) 309 AMXG Rework. It is the responsibility of 309 AMXG to
       strive for constant product improvement by identifying inefficient maintenance
       operations such as workmanship defects that lead to rework of an end item. Data
       relative to the cost, profit and loss, labor, and material associated with that rework
       will be collected and analyzed to determine if rework costs have exceeded the fiscal
       year budget. This data is found in the Time and Attendance (TAA) System by
       inquiry in “Processed Labor” by rework JON (X51112614000) and RCC and date
       range.
          19.2.19.4.1. (Added) 309 AMXG the production chiefs assigned to 309 AMXG
          will ensure compliance with the guidelines specified in this section, and will be
          responsible to ensure adequate corrective actions are taken to validate the process
          that contributed to the rework, (e.g., rework is accomplished, training provided,
          tooling and equipment are upgraded, etc.). Any information that identifies the
          effectiveness of corrective actions taken by the production chiefs will be briefed
          to 309 AMXG during the monthly squadron level team review.
          19.2.19.4.2. (Added) 309 AMARG. REWORK. The Planner will create a new
          rework WCD (child) and link it to the parent WCD that caused the rework. The
          Planner will copy task(s) from the parent WCD required to re-accomplish the
          rework. In the event that tasks from multiple WCDs must be reworked, the
          Planner will add those tasks to the existing rework WCD child on the WCD that
          caused the rework. MAXIMO will retain the original WCD and operation number
          to maintain traceability. If required, the Planner will re-sequence the tasks in the
          rework WCD to ensure continuity and facilitate task process execution. To
          identify and track rework material expenses, the new rework WCD will be used to
          order all materials required to accomplish the rework. Multiple rework events
          require separate rework WCDs. A statement why rework is needed must be
          entered in block 17 (description) or ‘notes on back’ of original WCD if space is
          limited; stamp/date legibly the original WCD.
       19.2.19.5. (Added) The OO-ALC/QPA will perform an audit of rework procedures
       upon request.
       19.2.19.6. (Added) 309 AMXG Rework of Items Still in Maintenance:
          19.2.19.6.1. (Added) Production personnel performing maintenance actions will
          verbally advise their production supervisor when any material or end item,
          weapon system, subsystem, or any part thereof, etc., is damaged as a result of
          maintenance actions, or lack of, to include defects attributable to errors in
          workmanship while the end item is still undergoing maintenance.
78                         AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014


        19.2.19.6.2. (Added) The production supervisor will assess damage caused as a
        result of maintenance actions and any errors in workmanship. The production
        personnel mechanics or supervisors will complete an MWR worksheet for aircraft
        maintenance squadron. All rework reported will need to be identified back to the
        originating cell or RCC that performed the maintenance. Comments on the
        worksheet or MWR must be completed following guidelines beginning in
        paragraph 19.2.19.12 of this rework section. The scheduler/ALS or planner will
        initiate appropriate WCD(s) for all rework. Scheduler/ALS will electronically file
        the worksheet or MWR into the appropriate systems.
        19.2.19.6.3. (Added) Production, scheduling and planning will attempt to
        identify all rework back to the original operation. The mechanic will enter the
        time into PDMSS or via TAA and log onto the WCD the scheduler has assigned
        for rework.
     19.2.19.7. (Added) The following categories are not considered rework:
        19.2.19.7.1. (Added) Unavoidable periodic calibrations and adjustments.
        19.2.19.7.2. (Added) Work normally required to hand-fit or select-fit parts in an
        assembly.
        19.2.19.7.3. (Added) Work done as a result of incoming or preliminary
        diagnostic tests and inspections performed to determine necessary repairs and
        replacements. When an item fails a particular step in a diagnostic test composed
        of a number of sequential steps, is then repaired but subsequently fails a later step
        in that test, rework will not be charged unless the subsequent failure is attributable
        to a discrepancy in the earlier repair.
        19.2.19.7.4. (Added) Additional work performed as part of the most economical
        method of doing a job. The exclusion does not apply when the additional work is
        required to correct work previously done on an item.
     19.2.19.8. (Added) 309 AMXG Management of Rework Costs While TDY. If the
     purpose of the TDY is to correct a discrepancy due to 309 AMXG maintenance
     actions, the team chief will ensure all costs are charged to overhead as stated in this
     section.
     19.2.19.9. (Added) 309 AMXG Quality Deficiency Reports. When analysis of the
     Quality Deficiency Report exhibit determines the technology repair center was at
     fault, all material and labor associated with the rework of the end item will be done
     IAW the instructions in this section.
     19.2.19.10. (Added) 309 AMXG Labor Costs: Production count will not be taken
     for operations undergoing rework. The production shop employee will document
     time expended on rework against X51112614000.
     19.2.19.11. (Added) 309 AMXG Ordering Material.
        19.2.19.11.1. (Added) Production shop employees will use an AFMC Form 95,
        Issue Request, for any material ordered in support of rework. The production
        shop supervisor will ensure the form indicates the material is in support of rework
        by annotating or stamping the word “rework” on the top margin of the form.
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                                   79


            19.2.19.11.2. (Added) All 309 AMXG material associated with the rework
            process is ordered by the 709th Maintenance Support Squadron production
            support personnel as overhead material using U6800 or U6812 as the control
            number.
            19.2.19.11.3. (Added) Expendable items normally ordered under cost code ‘A’,
            ‘L’, or ‘R’, will be ordered with control number U6800, cost code ‘L’.
            19.2.19.11.4. (Added) Kits ordered under cost code ‘D’, and all expense
            material ordered under cost code “M” will be ordered with control number
            U6800, cost code ‘X’.
            19.2.19.11.5. (Added) With investment or exchange material, use U6812 with
            same cost codes for those items normally procured as cost codes ‘B’ or ‘G’.
         19.2.19.12. (Added) 309 AMXG Rework Analysis.
            19.2.19.12.1. (OO-ALC Added) Analysts from the price and availability (P&A)
            section of aircraft or a management analyst from the back shop area will analyze
            the data and build monthly first time pass yield rate charts. The analyst will then
            submit charts and data to the squadron director or equivalent to be briefed at the
            monthly squadron team reviews.
            19.2.19.12.2. (Added) The 309 AMXG/QPA QA analysts will provide all
            weapons system P&A section analysts with the first time pass yield rates for all
            panel/area and paint inspections by the tenth working day of each month. The
            P&A analysts will incorporate QA data into their first time pass yield rate charts.
            19.2.19.12.3. (Added) Data is       compiled     into the PDMSS          web,
            https://apfemweb/mabr/Wdev/lms-athome.asp via the depot data storage
            system. This is for both back shop, ITS, and aircraft, PDMSS. Information on
            MWR, ITS worksheet and the original documents can all be found on this website
            for research.
         19.2.19.13. (Added) Other Than Re-Work WCD Documentation Requirements.
         WCD operations requiring further investigation for an unknown condition will have a
         red circle placed around the inspection/certification block.        The technician
         discovering an unknown condition shall place an informational note within the task
         description block stamping and dating informational note. See Figure 19.6

          19.4.2.6.1. (Added) Engineering red-line changes to POs. The responsible
          engineer may make changes or clarifications to an electronic PO and republish it
          after the initial full review has been completed as long as the small changes are
          minor and not deemed critical. This is essentially an electronic ‘red-line’ change
          to a PO.
              19.4.2.6.1.1. (Added) Only the process engineer or his/her delegate has
              access to modify the PO in the PODDS publisher system.
              19.4.2.6.1.2. (Added) Upon publishing, the process engineer will note what
              changes were made when prompted by the PODDS system.
              19.4.2.6.1.3. (Added) If small changes not deemed critical are made, the
              process engineer may publish without full signature review and the new PO
              will immediately be made available to the production shop floor via the
              PODDS reader. PODDS will assign a new revision number to the PO with
              each update, no matter how minor.
              19.4.2.6.1.4. (Added) If a minor red-line change is made to a hard copy
              process order, the process engineer will make the change and legibly print
              their name, sign and date near the change using red ink. The same process
              engineer shall ensure the PO contained in PODDS is immediately updated
              within 2 working days with a new revision number.
       19.4.2.10. (Added) Validation/Verification (val/ver) of new process orders. Once a
       draft process order has been written, process engineering will schedule a formal
       Process val/ver with production shop personnel and quality assurance. AMARG
       planning will be responsible for scheduling a formal Process Order Val/Ver. The
       draft process order must be printed out in hardcopy and the note in red “Draft, for
       V/V” placed at the top of the document.
          19.4.2.10.1. (Added) Mandatory attendance at all val/vers shall be production

        technicians, quality assurance, and the process engineer developing the PO. Other
        parties such as safety or planning will participate if requested by production,
        quality or process engineering. The val/ver will consist of 100% hands-on
        performance by production personnel required to use the PO in performance of
        the process or task.
        19.4.2.10.2. (Added) Any deficiencies or other issues shall be noted in red on
        the draft document.
        19.4.2.10.3. (Added) Changes deemed minor by both production, quality and
        engineering may be made to the draft without the need for an additional val/ver.
        Major changes to procedures to the draft process order will require a re-val/ver.
        19.4.2.10.4. (Added) At the completion of the val/ver, production, quality, and
        process engineer (and any other parties that assisted in the val/ver) will legibly
        print, sign and date the front page of the draft process order and process
        engineering will then submit the process order (with any changes made) for
        official review, coordination, and publication.
        19.4.2.10.5. (Added) Process engineering will maintain a file of the draft
        process orders with val/ver signatures for a minimum of two years.
        19.4.2.10.6. (Added) Val/ver’s are not required for renewal or minor
        modification of existing process orders.

   technical support and ensure mission success through proper planning, design,
AFI21-101_AFMCSUP_OO-ALCSUP 4 FEBRUARY 2014                                                   107


  implementation, and execution of the processes necessary to meet clearly defined depot
  customer requirements. This also includes the engineering responsibility for process control
  through surveillance and measurement to provide for repeatability and set the stage for
  process improvements. Depot engineering requires a broad range of science and engineering
  disciplines including, but not limited to aerospace engineers, mechanical engineers, chemical
  engineers, electrical engineers, computer scientists, materials engineers, physicists, chemists,
  etc. The diversity and complexity of the industrial processes the depot engineer is
  responsible for drives the need for a diverse and highly skilled technical workforce. The
  depot engineering function provides technical oversight to all stages of the depot operations.
     22.1.1. Requirements. As new workload materializes and existing workloads change,
     depot engineering must be involved from the very beginning to include organic ‘repair’
     determinations primarily through the source of repair process (SORAP) and is defined as
     having the primary responsibility to ensure technical requirements are documented,
     understood and achievable. Depot engineering is responsible for ensuring sufficient
     technical data is available, establishing relationship with customer’s engineering
     authority and developing a proper understanding of technical risks associated with the
     workload.
     22.1.2. Process. Depot engineering is responsible for planning and developing all
     technical processes required to meet both customer workload requirements and technical
     requirements for a specific workload or for a series of similar workloads. These
     processes include engineering processes, industrial processes, supporting technical
     processes, including equipment, facilities, lab services, Non Destructive Inspection
     (NDI), Configuration Management (CM), process control, surveillance, etc. This
     responsibility requires identification of resources and infrastructure (e.g., facilities,
     equipment and instruments/tools).       Once established depot engineering has the
     responsibility to baseline the process and control change through robust configuration
     management and data management procedures. Depot engineering has the responsibility
     that all developed processes must be verified and validated against the technical
     requirement.
  22.1.3. Where 309 SMXG has a similar structure and process in place, based on CMMI
  protocols, 309 SMXG will be considered compliant with the structure as outlined below.
