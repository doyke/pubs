define unit responsibilities and limitations.
1. BASH Program Information.
   1.1. Situation. Dover AFB is in an area of high Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
   potential. Located on the Atlantic migratory flyway, Dover AFB is a stop-over zone for
   thousands of migrating birds from September to April each year. The air base is located in
   close proximity to three wildlife refuges, surrounded by grain and bean farms and has several
   large bodies of water nearby. A healthy resident goose population exacerbates the situation.
   1.2. Specific hazards.
2                                                     DOVERAFBI91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2013


        1.2.1. Waterfowl. Canadian and Snow goose populations present a significant hazard to
        the Dover flying environment. In addition to a resident Canadian goose population,
        migratory birds begin arriving in early October and depart in early April. These birds
        gather in flocks of several hundred to several thousand and fly across Dover’s approach
        and departure corridors during their daily transition between roosting and feeding areas.
        Effective dispersal techniques include, but are not limited to, the use of a wildlife
        management expert who uses working dogs and pyrotechnics.
        1.2.2. Birds of prey. Hawks, owls, and vultures soar over and near Dover's runways in
        search of food. While searching they often fly co-altitude with aircraft on the approach
        or departure flight paths. Mitigation efforts include ridding the airfield environment of
        rodents and the use of pyrotechnic dispersal techniques.
        1.2.3. Gulls. Gulls present a particularly hazardous situation to Dover AFB. A distinct
        pattern has emerged where gulls fly from the coastal area across both runways inland in
        the morning in small groups. In the late afternoon they gather at the marsh and Pioneer
        ponds at the approach end of runway 01. When leaving this area at dusk they spiral up in
        large groups to circle the ponds at altitudes up to 1000 ft. above ground level and fly back
        to the coastal areas across the approach of runway 01 and occasionally 32. During cold
        weather and rainy days the birds use the runway overruns and taxiways as areas to warm
        themselves. Dispersal techniques include but are not limited to the use of working dogs,
        pyrotechnics, paint ball guns and depredation.
        1.2.4. Blackbirds. These species present a hazard during their flocking season. The
        flocking population peaks from mid-October through November and again in February.
        The large number of birds presents a significant threat when they feed on seeds in the
        vicinity of the airfield. Dispersal techniques include the use of long grass management
        and pyrotechnics.
        1.2.5. TILCON ponds. TILCON is a gravel pit that has several large bodies of water on
        its property, located at the approach end of runway 01. The water attracts large numbers
        of waterfowl and gulls resulting in a significant hazard to air traffic. Gulls spiral up to
        depart the area in the afternoon and fly directly in the arrival and departure corridors.
        Methods used to mitigate this hazard include active harassment of birds and a cooperative
        environmental management effort with Pioneer.
        1.2.6. Waste Transfer Station. A waste transfer station operated by Eastern Shores
        Environmental Inc. (ESE) is located less than 1,500 feet from the departure end of
        runway 01. This transfer station is in the process of relocating to a location 20 miles
        from the airfield and is currently only accepting cardboard. Methods used to mitigate this
        hazard include observing operations and monitoring bird activity.
    1.3. Bird Hazard Working Group (BHWG). The BHWG meets to review wildlife strike data,
    identify and recommend actions to reduce hazards, and recommend changes in operational
    procedures. The BHWG meetings should discuss, but are not limited to the following topics:
    wildlife strike statistics, bird activity, habitat management/modification, BASH plan
    procedures, BASH awareness and education, and activities/results of the wildlife management
    contractor. The BHWG will meet quarterly during BASH Phase I and bi-monthly during
    Phase II or as bird conditions warrant. The BHWG is hosted by Wing Safety (436 AW/SE)
    and chaired by the Vice Wing Commander (436 AW/CV). Other members of the BHWG

    include: 436 AW/CP (Command Post), 436 AW/PA (Public Affairs), 436 AW/JA (Legal),
    512 AW/SE (Safety), 436 OG/CC, 3 AS/CC, 9 AS/CC, 436 OSS/CC, 436 OSS/OSA (Airfield
    Ops), 436 OSS/OSAA (Airfield Management), 436 OSS/OSAT (Tower), 436 OSS/OSO

    Management Shop), 436 CES/CEV (CE Environmental Flight), 436 FSS/SVRA (Aero Club),
    436 CONS/LGCB (Contracting), and the Wildlife Management contractor.
    1.4. Habitat modification. By incorporating specific practices into the base land management
    plan, Dover AFB can maintain a flightline habitat less attractive to birds and other wildlife.
    Any base beautification or wetland enhancement plans will be coordinated through Wing
    Safety (436 AW/SE), Base Legal (436 AW/JA), Civil Engineering (436 CES/CEV), and
    Airfield Operations (436 OSS/OSA) IAW AFI 13-204V3, Airfield Operations Procedures
    and Programs.
        1.4.1. Managing grass height. Refer to AFI 91-202. The grass height goal is 7-14 inches
        “effective height.” This refers to the grass depth after it is cut, not the actual height of the
        mower blade. When cut to the minimum 7-inch level, slower growing species of grass
        are not allowed to grow properly, while other species are allowed to grow to extreme
        lengths before being cropped back. The result is a patchwork of short, stumpy grass
        species, interspersed with longer, fast-growing patches. There is a two-part solution to
        this problem. First, faster growing species of weeds should be eliminated or reduced by
        the controlled use of herbicides. Second, the mowing contractor should maintain grass to
        achieve the 7-14 inches “effective height”. A properly designed and maintained long
        grass management program strives to reduce the bird population on the airfield. Long
        grass works to deter birds by either preventing them from efficiently seeing the
        invertebrates close to the ground or preventing them from seeing into the distance,
        effectively making them unable to remain vigilant for the approach of predators. Short
        grass cutting (i.e. the manicured lawn protocol) should be limited as much as possible.
        The areas immediately around buildings and hangars on the base proper could be cut
        short if required, but the standard throughout the airfield environment should be longer
        grasses with only qualified exceptions, i.e. the Air Museum and the Civil Air Terminal.
        1.4.2. Controlling broad-leafed weeds. Broad-leafed weeds attract a variety of birds,
        may produce seeds or berries, and may limit grass growth. Keep broad-leafed weeds to a
        minimum on the airfield. Apply herbicides as necessary to achieve this and comply with
        AFI 32-1053, Pest Management Program.
        1.4.3. Planting sparsely vegetated areas. Eliminate bare areas on the airfield. Plant grass
        species unattractive to wildlife as necessary to maintain ground cover.
        1.4.4. Fertilizing. Selectively stimulate grass growth to promote adequate vegetation
        height and uniform cover. Otherwise limit use of fertilizer that promotes lush green
        growth attractive to wildlife.
        1.4.5. Removing edge effect. Maintain the airfield as uniformly as possible to reduce the
        transition zone between two distinct habitat types (e.g., brush to grassland).
        1.4.6. Leveling of airfield. Level or fill high or low spots to reduce attractiveness to
        wildlife and prevent standing water. Ensure paragraph 1.4 is complied with.
4                                                     DOVERAFBI91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2013


        1.4.7. Removing dead vegetation. Remove dead vegetation such as brush piles, grass
        clippings, etc. This will effectively remove the cover it affords. Removal of dead
        vegetation also helps control rodent populations.
        1.4.8. Remove bird and animal carcasses from the airfield. In an effort to avoid
        attracting scavengers, remove carcasses as soon as they are discovered. Forward remains
        that may have been caused by collision with aircraft to Flight Safety (436 AW/SEF) for
        identification.
        1.4.9. Pest controls. Invertebrates and rodents are key food sources for many birds.
        Periodically survey and reduce these pests when required. Pesticides and traps can
        reduce pest populations. Ensure compliance with AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials
        Management, Section 2.5. The use of these pesticides must be coordinated through and
        approved by the 436 CES Pest Management Shop. The use of these pesticides must be in
        strict accordance with their instructions IAW AFI 32-1053 and in conjunction with the
        approved EPA permit for Dover AFB regarding Storm-water Pollution Prevention.
        1.4.10. Maintaining drainage ditches. Regularly inspect ditches to keep them clear.
        Maintain ditch sides as steep as possible (minimum slope ratio of 5 to 1) and mow
        vegetation to discourage wading birds and emergent vegetation. Improve drainage as
        necessary to inhibit temporary ponds or puddles and coordinate with CEV to ensure no
        impact on wetlands.
        1.4.11. Eliminate roosting sites. Control roosts by vegetation management of roost sites
        where possible. Prune trees to reduce the number of perches if necessary. Refer To
        Whom It May Concern: the Land Management Plan and UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and
        Heliport Planning and Design.
        1.4.12. Discourage wildlife feeding. Signs should be placed in picnic areas to educate
        the public on the hazard posed by feeding wildlife, particularly geese.
    1.5. Bird Dispersal Operations. Airfield Management or the Wildlife Control Contractor may
    accomplish bird dispersal operations. Dispersal operations include, but are not limited to, the
    use of working dogs, pyrotechnics, and paint ball guns. Prior to conducting dispersal, the
    airfield control tower will be contacted by telephone or radio for coordination of bird
    movement. No movement of birds will be accomplished until cleared by tower personnel.
    Personnel performing dispersal will inform tower of the location of birds and anticipated
    direction of movement. If dispersal is being conducted off base, use the grid map (see
    Attachment 2) to ensure clear communication of the location. Upon notification and approval
    for movement of birds, the tower will upgrade the bird watch condition (BWC) for affected
    runway(s) as appropriate. Once dispersal operations are complete and the birds have vacated
    the area, contact the tower with this information. The tower may then change the bird watch
    condition as appropriate.
    1.6. Depredation. Depredation may need to be accomplished to re-enforce reaction to
    pyrotechnics or eliminate a strike hazard from the airfield. Strict adherence to the U.S. Fish
    and Wildlife Service permit is required. The Deputy Base Civil Engineer maintains the
    permit; the permit must be renewed annually. The permit must be carried at all times while
    depredating. The number of each wildlife species taken must be documented. Refer to the
    permit for number of each species allowed, disposition of remains, ammunition requirements,

    2.6. Air Traffic Control (436 OSS/OSA).
       2.6.1. Monitors level of bird activity using tower observation, RAPCON reports, aircrew
       reports, and Bird Management Contractor reports.
       2.6.2. Tower supervisors determine the BWC based on wildlife activity (see section 4).
       In addition to Tower's observations, the BWC will be based on reports from the
       RAPCON, aircrews, Safety, and/or information provided by the Bird Management
       Contractor. After a reported bird strike within the terminal environment, the BWC will
       automatically be raised to MODERATE for reassessment of the BWC. During this time,
       Tower, with recommendations from the Bird Management Contractor and aircraft in the
       pattern, will determine the appropriate BWC.
       2.6.3. Advises all personnel, aircraft, vehicles, and the Bird Management Contractor over

       via the Information Dissemination System v5 alarm notification.
       2.6.4. During Phase II, tower will broadcast the BWC on the Automatic Terminal
       Information Service (ATIS) and to the Bird Management Contractor over the Tower net
       when the BWC changes. Tower controllers will make a blanket broadcast on the Tower
       Net stating any changes to the BWC Monday through Friday from sunrise to sunset.
       Phraseology example would be, “Attention all vehicles and personnel, Dover’s bird
       watch condition is________ (low, moderate, severe)” or “Attention all vehicles and
       personnel, Dover’s bird watch condition is _________ (low, moderate, severe) to
       RWY______ (01/19, 14/32)”. The BWC should be included on the ATIS when the BWC
       is Moderate or Severe, regardless of Phase I or II. When the BWC is rapidly changing
       tower will include the following statement on the ATIS: "Due to rapidly changing bird
       watch conditions, contact Dover Tower or Dover Approach for current bird watch
       condition."

4. Flying Operations.
     4.1. Bird Watch Conditions. The following terminology is established to rapidly
     communicate bird activity. Restrictions associated with each condition are applicable to all
     AMC aircraft. The BWC can be different for each runway and will be called as applicable.
     It cannot be overstressed that the use of numbers ("5-15 large birds") in the definition of a
     BWC is intended as a guide. Personnel responsible for establishing and maintaining a BWC
     must assess a myriad of factors when establishing BWCs. One bird in any given location can
     drive a BWC of Severe, Moderate or Low. NOTE: The restrictions associated with each
     condition do not preclude the aircraft commander’s emergency authority to land if fuel status
     or other emergencies pose a greater risk.
10                                                    DOVERAFBI91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2013


         4.1.1. BWC LOW. LOW is defined as normal bird activity (fewer than 5 large birds or
         fewer than 15 small birds) on or above the airfield with a low probability of hazard.
         Local training and airlift missions approved.
         4.1.2. BWC MODERATE. MODERATE will be declared during increased bird
         population (5 to 15 large birds or 15 to 30 small birds) in locations (airdrome and
         within 20 degrees of arrival and departure corridors) that represent an increased
         potential for strike. The BWC will be upgraded only if visual sightings indicate
         reported bird activity presents an actual threat. Only initial takeoffs and full stop
         landings are allowed for the BWC MODERATE runway. The aircraft commander and
         ATC must coordinate an arrival or departure path that has the least amount of reported
         bird activity. If both runways are MODERATE, local transition training must either
         hold until the BWC is downgraded or coordinate with Command Post to go to an
         alternate training airfield.
         4.1.3. BWC SEVERE. SEVERE will be declared when high bird population [more
         than 15 large birds (waterfowl, raptors, gulls, etc.) or 30 small birds (terns, swallows,
         etc.)] on or immediately above the active runway or specific locations (taxiways, in-
         field areas, departure or arrival routes, etc.) that represents a high potential for strike.
         The BWC will be upgraded only if visual sightings indicate reported bird activity
         presents an actual threat. Local training and airlift mission departures and arrivals
         require 436 OG/CC approval for a runway that is BWC SEVERE. The aircraft
         commander will coordinate with ATC to determine the best arrival/departure route and
         runway. The aircraft commander will coordinate through Command Post to obtain 436
         OG/CC approval for air operations. Command Post will notify tower and RAPCON if
         operations are approved or disapproved.
     4.2. Phase I Operations. Phase I operations concentrate on bird control actions and are in
     effect year round. During phase I, BWC will be used to communicate any strike hazards.
     4.3. Phase II Operations. Phase II is implemented during the migratory and flocking bird
     seasons that historically take place from early October to early April. The Phase II period
     can be adjusted by Wing Safety with coordination of the Wildlife Control Contractor. The
     decision to alter the Phase II window is accomplished through the Bird Hazard Working
     Group on the recommendations of Wing Safety. Additional restrictions to flying operations
     apply during phase II as follows:
         4.3.1. Current Operations should not schedule arrivals/departures during peak bird
         hours, between 30 minutes prior to and 90 minutes after sunrise and sunset. Should
         mission requirements dictate, AMC aircraft on TACC missions are restricted to full
         stop landings and mission departures during peak bird hours. Scheduling 436th/512th
         training operations during this time requires 436 OG/CC approval.
         4.3.2. Use a minimum radar traffic pattern altitude of 3000 feet to the maximum extent
         possible. Deviations are permitted for higher priority tasking such as aircraft separation,
         etc. Bird radar returns, reported sightings, and bird watch condition should be used to
         decide whether to issue a lower pattern altitude.
         4.3.3. During Phase II, 436 OG/CC approval required for any transient request to train
         in the local Dover area within the high risk times near sunrise and sunset (-.5 to +1.5
11                                                 DOVERAFBI91-212 1 FEBRUARY 2013


       hours of sunrise and -.5 to +1.5 hours of sunset.
 4.4. Dover AFB Aero Club/Flight Training Center. Due to the size, speed and ability to
 maneuver to avoid birds, Dover AFB Aero Club aircraft will be permitted to operate normally
 during phase I and phase II except as follows:
     4.4.1. Dover AFB Aero Club aircraft will not take-off or land on any runway that is
     reported as BWC SEVERE.
     4.4.2. Dover AFB Aero Club flight instructors will not clear student pilots for solo flight
     when BWC is MODERATE or SEVERE.
     4.4.3. During phase II, Dover AFB Aero Club pilots with less than 100 hours total flight
     time should avoid arrivals/departures between 30 minutes prior to and 90 minutes after
     sunrise and sunset.
