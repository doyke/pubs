       EGLIN INITIAL AND ANNUAL INFORMATION SECURITY TRAINING
                              STANDARDS

A2.1. This training plan is the blueprint to follow when planning initial and annual refresher
training for cleared and uncleared personnel. 96 TW/IP derived this plan from AF Information
Protection training standards developed by the Secretary of the Air Force. These standards were
used to prepare quarterly Information Security training presentations 96 TW/IP provides to
Security Managers at the beginning of each quarter. Security Mangers are responsible for
administering training to unit personnel and are encouraged to tailor the presentations and
incorporate unit specific information when necessary. When used, ensure locally developed
training meets these standards. Initial training presentations are often specific to each unit, and
therefore units are expected to develop their own presentations. However, sample presentations
are available upon request.
A2.1. During Local Information Protection Management Evaluations (LIPME), 96 TW/IP will
compare your annual program with this training plan to validate information protection training
standards are being followed.
Table A2.1. Information Protection training standards. The far right columns indicate the
training standard applies to “C” for cleared personnel and “U” for uncleared personnel.
