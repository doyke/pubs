      AMW/CV via the WAPM for approval prior to manpower office pricing out the fair
      share quota. The WAPM will also send the request to the ARB members prior to the
      ARB.
          3.2.1.1. The 375 AMW/CV (ARB Chair) prioritizes augmentation requests in order
          of greatest mission impact.
      3.2.2. Requests can be forwarded at any time, but no later than 30 days prior to the next

      days after convening.
4. Augmentation Program Call-up Procedures.
   4.1. When a supported unit deems it necessary to utilize augmentees, the squadron
   commander will submit a request through their group commander to the WAPM. The
   requesting unit commander’s request should include the number of personnel required,
   estimated duration, beginning date of augmentee duty, and justification.
   4.2. Upon the 375 AMW/CV approval, the WAPM will notify GAMs of the tasking and
   provide any other necessary information. The GAMs will in turn notify their supporting unit
   commanders and UACs who will notify the augmentees.
5. Approved Augmentation Requests.
   5.1. The following augmentation requests are approved by the ARB and need to be
   revalidated annually by the ARB.
      5.1.1. Honor Guard.
 6                                                    375AMWI10-243 22 SEPTEMBER 2014


            5.1.1.1. Twenty-eight positions are required to ensure enough personnel are available
            to fulfill all eligible funeral requests as well as ceremonial functions. The Air Force
            will ensure that, upon request, a funeral honors detail is provided for all eligible
            members. Base Honor Guards will support protocol and ceremonial functions for
            military and civilians, time and resources permitting.
        5.1.2. Emergency Management Support Team (EMST).
            5.1.2.1. Eight positions are required to support Civil Engineer Squadron (CES/CE)
            Readiness Flight for emergency operations. They are needed to support the
            Emergency Operation Center (EOC) as well as the Active Chemical, Biological,
            Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Response (ACR) Team. Two of the total
            augmentees are reserved for CE personnel.
        5.1.3. Mobility Machine.
            5.1.3.1. Forty-two positions are needed for 375th Logistics Readiness Squadron
            (LRS) to support real world Maximum Simultaneous Deployment Capability
            operations as well as regular mobility exercises/inspections.
        5.1.4. Security Forces Squadron (SFS).
            5.1.4.1. Ten Security Forces positions are required during phases of overlapping
            deployments. This will provide an uninterrupted flow of security, allowing SFS to
            continue day-to-day operations.
        5.1.5. Fitness Assessment Cell (FAC) (375 FSS).
            5.1.5.1. Four FAC positions are required for the Fitness Assessment (FA) program.
            These four requirements will be reduced from the 375 FSS overall requirements
            during the fair share price out. This allows for centralized control and oversight of
            the FA program and test administration continuity is maintained.
6. Approved Augmentation Exemptions for the 375 AMW.
     6.1. The following E-6 and below exemptions are approved by the ARB but should be
     reviewed and can be elevated for the reevaluation by any ARB member. Note: Unless
     specifically stated in an AFI that Airmen are exempt from additional duties and/or details,
     augmentees may be requested from the following units and agencies for short-term additional
     duty work (base clean-up, snow removal, etc.) at the discretion of the AMW/CC.
        6.1.1. The 375th Air Mobility Wing Staff Agency.
            6.1.1.1. Command Post (1C3X1).

               day, 7 days a week, manning requirement for the C2 facility, CP controllers
               working rotating shifts will not perform additional duties/details beyond the score
               of C2 functions (e.g., base clean up, snow removal, augmentee duties) outside of
               the CP. This provision does not apply to personnel assigned to overhead positions
               who routinely work normal day shift schedules.
            6.1.1.2. Safety (1S0X1).
375AMWI10-243 22 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                             7


        6.1.1.3. AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, paragraph 2.1.
        Minimize assigning full-time safety personnel additional duties not directly
        associated with duties described in 91-series directives and their supplements. Due to
        the time-critical mishap response and investigative requirements, the assignment of
        long-term, labor intensive, or mission impacting duties (i.e., Additional Duty First
        Sergeant) upon professional safety Airmen should be minimized. Trained and
        qualified safety personnel must be available to perform safety investigative
        responsibilities upon mishap notification.
        6.1.1.4. Chaplain Assistants.
           6.1.1.4.1. AFI 52-101, Planning and Organization, paragraph 3.2.4. Chaplain
           assistants are trained to provide spiritual care in a religiously pluralistic
           environment. The chaplain assistant specialty description is specified in the Air
           Force Enlisted Classification Directory. The chaplain assistant is vital to the
           Chaplain Corps mission and will not serve in long-term additional Ready Program
           duties in accordance with AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM)
           Program Planning and Operations and AFPAM 10-243.
     6.1.2. The 375th Mission Support Group.
        6.1.2.1. Explosive Ordnance Disposal, (EOD) (3E8X1).
           6.1.2.1.1. AFI 32-3001, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Program,
           paragraph 2. Due to the emergency response nature of EOD, non-functional
           specific duties of EOD personnel will be limited. Individual and team classroom
           and proficiency training, emergency response, and practical exercises are the
           primary peacetime mission. EOD personnel must be available for training,
           emergency response, and off installation taskings (i.e., United States Secret
           Service, Department of State, major command (MAJCOM) taskings, etc.). For
           active forces, total man-hours expended supporting additional duties will not
           exceed 5 man-hours per month per individual. Do not assign EOD personnel to
           other duties that will take them away from their primary peacetime mission. A
           minimum of two 3E8X1 (EOD) personnel will perform standby duties. One will
           be at least a 3E851. Every attempt should be made to have a 7-level team chief, if
           possible. Both members will be completely signed off on the 627 CES Stand-by
           Initial Job Qualification Standards (IJQS). The Stand-by team members will be
           available for responses, on or off base, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Stand-by
           duty will rotate every 7 days, 1000 hours Monday to 1000 hours the following
           Monday, mission pending. If Monday is a holiday, changeover will occur at 1000
           on the next duty day. Stand-by teams will be thoroughly familiar with AFI 32-
           3001, EOD Assistance to Local Government and Civil Authorities.
        6.1.2.2. Fire Protection (3E7X1).
           6.1.2.2.1. AFI 32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention
           Program, paragraph 3.1.4. Base Fire Marshals will ensure that all regularly
           scheduled civilian overtime is fully justified. They also ensure that the work
           schedule for military firefighters does not exceed 72 hours per week (T-3).

       Planning and Operations, paragraph 2.5.11. Emergency responders, as defined
       by the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS), Disaster Response
       Force (DRF), are members of the DRF elements that deploy after the First
       Responders to expand C2 and provide additional support. Emergency Responders
       include follow-on firefighters, law enforcement and security personnel, and
       emergency medical technicians, EOD personnel, physicians, nurses, medical
       treatment providers at medical treatment facilities (first receivers), emergency
       management personnel, public health officers, bioenvironmental engineer,
       mortuary affairs personnel, and other specialized team members. Emergency
       Responder duties have priority over other assigned duties. Emergency responders
       are not assigned as augmentees or to additional duties that will conflict with their
       emergency duties.
    6.1.2.4. Security Forces Personnel (3P0XX).
       6.1.2.4.1. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (FOUO), paragraph 1.5. All airmen
       have a responsibility in integrated defense. Security forces will identify units and

       Integrated Defense Planning (including augmentees). This instruction outlines
       minimum requirements for security and support forces dedicated to protection
       level resources and identifies required capabilities. It includes requirements for
       weapons, vehicles, and communications equipment. Note: Security forces and
       augmentee personnel should not be included in base details if their duty schedule
       is in excess of the majority of the base populace.
    6.1.2.5. Installation Personnel Readiness (IPR).
       6.1.2.5.1. IPR is responsible for the deployment out-processing of the 375 AMW
