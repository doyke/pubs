wing Facilities Board (FB). This applies to all 433 Airlift Wing (AW) units. To ensure a full
understanding of the process, users of this instruction should also be familiar with other AFI 32-series
(Civil Engineering) publications shown as reference in the following paragraphs. Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the
Air Force Information Management Tool (AF IMT 847), Recommendation for Change of Publication;

Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records and disposed of in accordance with the Air
Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

1. Facilities Board Concept. The 433 Airlift Wing (AW) FB provides corporate review and validation
of Civil Engineering actives, to include construction of new facilities, renovation of existing facilities,
and use of real property (land and facilities) for the 433 AW. The 433 AW FB annually prioritizes
projects for the Real Property Maintenance by Contract (RPMC), Military Construction (MILCON),
Energy (Energy Conservation Investment Program and Federal Energy Management Program), Medical,
Environmental, and Non-appropriated Funds (NAF) construction on programs for the 433 AW.
   1.1. Priorities. These priorities will then be provided to host wing for inclusion and consideration at
   the Installation Facilities Board.
2. Board Membership. The 433d Airlift Wing Commanders (AW/CC) is the chairperson of the 433
AW FB. The commander has the over-arching vision for the wing and provides a non-biased chair for
the FB. Membership on the FB is comprised of the 433 AW/CC and each 433 AW Group Commander.
2                                                                    433AWI32-1012 14 APRIL 2009


The 433d Mission Support Group Commander (MSG/CC) will provide a recorder to publish the minutes
of FB meetings.
3. Board Responsibilities. The FB will meet as required (normally each quarter) to decide on any
pending facility and real property use and development issues. The chairperson can establish a working
group(s) to help the board as deemed necessary. As a minimum, the following real property
management items must be presented for board action and approval.
    3.1. Board must: Review, validate, and prioritize a balanced three year RPMC program (current
    Fiscal Year (FY), FY+ 1, FY+2). The FB must ensure that the annual RPMC program over the
    current FY, FY+1, and FY+2 is compatible with fiscal budgets. The goal is to execute project
    design FY+1 projects, and plan/program FY+2 projects in the current FY. Ensure all projects are in
    accordance with Installation General Plans and Comprehensive Planning Framework prescribed in
    AFI 32-7062, Air Force Comprehensive Planning.
       3.1.1. Review, validate, and prioritize the MILCON program as described in AFI 32-1021,
       Planning and Programming Military Construction (MILCON) Projects. Ensure all projects are
       in accordance with Installation General Plans and Comprehensive Planning Framework
       prescribed in AFI 32-7062.
    3.2. Manage the use of existing real property. Under Executive Order 12411, Government Work
    Space Management Reforms, installation commanders must see that real property facilities are
    efficiently used. This includes identifying and correcting deficiencies, keeping records of facility
    use and facility requirements, performing management analysis when deficiencies are identified, and
    deactivating and disposing of excess facilities. Reference AFI 32-9002, Use of Real Property
    Facilities.
       3.2.1. Review, validate, and prioritize all requests for occupancy, change in utilization,
       conversions, and redesignation of all 433 AW facilities. The FB also approves, disapproves, and
       prioritizes all requests for adjustment of floor space and long-range plans for buildings.
       Reference AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property, and 433 AWI 32-9001, Use of Real
       Property Facilities.
    3.3. 433 AW Facility Utilization Working Group (FUWG).
       3.3.1. The purpose of the FUWG is to provide staff resources to review and analyze all requests
       for FB action, and make recommendations to the FB for consideration.
       3.3.2. The 433 MSG/CC is responsible for appointing a chairperson and three to five members
       to the FUWG. Members should be volunteers and can be appointed from any organization
       within the 433 AW. Members should be prepared to serve for a minimum of two years. When
       considering membership on the FUWG, members should have sufficient rank and experience to
       thoroughly analyze and consider facility space requests and make recommendations for the FB
       that best represent the 433 AW corporate interests. Because the FB has final decision making
       authority, it is not necessary for every 433 AW Group to be represented on the FUWG. The
       FUWG will normally meet once each month, and more often as required.
4. Duties:
    4.1. 433 AW/CC. Chairs 433 AW Facility Board. Final decision making authority regarding all
    facility and project issues.
    4.2. 433 AW Group Commanders. Serve as voting members of the 433 AW Facility Board.
