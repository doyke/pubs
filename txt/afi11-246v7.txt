                     AIRCREW TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION

2.1. Demonstration Pilot Training and Certification. Units will train and certify
demonstration pilots as sportsman or intermediate aerobatic pilots before wing commander (or

Sailplane Aircrew Training, specifies sportsman and intermediate aerobatic pilot training
requirements. Units may specify additional training requirements before demonstration pilot
certification.
2.2. Aerial Control Team Training and Certification. Units will train and certify ACT
members for duties required to support sailplane demonstrations according to unit-approved
training plans. (T-2).

                                            Chapter 3

                        STANDARD DEMONSTRATION PROFILES

3.1. General. Attachment 3 describes the standard sailplane demonstration profiles. The
profiles require either sportsman or intermediate-certified demonstration pilots. Each profile
includes approved maneuvers and the sequence in which they are performed. All maneuvers
flown in aerobatic demonstrations are derived from the International Aerobatic Club (IAC)
official contest rules (available at: http://members.iac.org/contests/rulebook.html) and
the     Aresti    System       Glider   Aerobatic      Figures   catalog     (available    at:
http://www.arestisystem.com), or a MAJCOM-approved aerobatic training program. Pilots will
not alter approved demonstration profiles unless necessary due to safety or weather
considerations, except as follows:
     3.1.1. Pilots will maintain final glide distance to an appropriate landing site. Pilots may
     adjust minimum altitudes upwards based on current atmospheric conditions to maintain final
     glide distance. If the entry conditions are not met for any maneuver, the pilot will execute a
     wings-level pass and reattempt the maneuver entry or transition to the next maneuver. Pilots
     will not makeup for maneuvers not accomplished in the prescribed sequence.
     3.1.2. The demonstration sequences are designed so each maneuver is always performed in
     the same direction with respect to the wind. As a result, the show may be oriented in any of
     four directions, depending on the wind and the crowd line, without considering it a profile
     change.
     3.1.3. The demonstration profiles are designed to fit in a minimum aerobatic box of
     dimensions 3,300 feet long by 3,300 feet wide by 4,500 feet tall. Pilots may increase the
     height of the box to accommodate all maneuvers in the profile. Pilots may also increase the
     lateral boundaries of the box for specific demonstrations. Minimum show lines will not be
     compromised.
3.2. Weather Requirements. Pilots will maintain visual meteorological conditions according
to AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules, throughout the demonstration.
     3.2.1. The minimum weather for a demonstration is a ceiling at least 3,500 feet above
     ground level (AGL), 5 miles visibility, and a discernible horizon.
     3.2.2. The minimum weather for a high speed pass is a ceiling at least 1,500 feet AGL and 3
     miles visibility.
3.3. Airspace Requirements. In addition to the aerobatic box dimensions, airspace must be
designated for aerotow and holding prior to the demonstration.
3.4. Show Lines. AFI 11-209 prescribes show line requirements.
3.5. Minimum Airspeed. AFI 11-209 prescribes minimum airspeed requirements.
3.6. Minimum Altitudes. The minimum altitude guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and AFI
11-209 apply. In addition, pilots may only perform aerobatics down to their certified altitude
AFI11-246V7 24 OCTOBER 2014                                                              7


(according to AFI 11-2Sailplane, Volume 1), or within the airspace approved for aerobatics,
whichever is higher.
