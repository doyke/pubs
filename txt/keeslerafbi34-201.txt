1. RESPONSIBILITIES. Active duty military, retired military, DoD employees, and other
base-affiliated members are responsible for the welfare of families and for the conduct of their
dependents and guests while on the military installation or in government sponsored housing.
2. CONDUCT. Table 1 identifies the requirements for the supervision of children based on the
child’s age. It was developed and approved by the Keesler AFB Family Advocacy Committee
and Keesler Integrated Resource Team (KIRT). You should use good judgment to determine
whether other restrictions are necessary based on your child's mental and physical maturity level.
This policy cannot cover every situation. There will be exceptions for which Family Advocacy
can/will make determinations (377-7006). Adherence to this instruction is meant to ensure the
safety of children. Failure to follow this guidance may result in interventions by base authorities
and agencies.

   2.1. Parents, guardians, and/or designated caretakers of children are expected to carefully
   consider several important variables before deciding that their children can safely be left
   without direct adult supervision for any period of time. These factors include:
       2.1.1. Maturity of the child.
       2.1.2. Duration and frequency of times without direct supervision.
       2.1.3. Child’s knowledge of emergency procedures.
       2.1.4. Presence of physically/emotionally handicapping conditions.
       2.1.5. Accessibility to parent or another specific informed adult.
       2.1.6. Number and ages of other children present without direct supervision.
       2.1.7. Age-appropriateness of responsibilities given to the child.
       2.1.8. Specific nature of ongoing child activities while unsupervised.
   2.2. A responsible caretaker must be physically and mentally capable of providing the
   necessary supervision of the child/children under his/her care.
   2.3. When a child is discovered unsupervised, and a reasonable suspicion exists that the
   child is being neglected, a referral will be made to the Family Advocacy Program (FAP). A
   social worker from the FAP will consider the factors above in making a determination.
   2.4. Unattended children who exhibit destructive behavior such as vandalism or stealing
   should be reported to Security Forces.
3. BABY-SITTING GUIDELINES.
   3.1. All children and/or baby-sitters should have the telephone numbers to notify police, fire
   and rescue personnel, parent or responsible adult in the event of an emergency.
   3.2. Baby-sitting is by definition a temporary situation and not a replacement for a
   permanent child care arrangement with a licensed child care provider. Individuals under 18
   years of age who care for younger children are strongly encouraged to participate in a
   certified baby-sitters course. Since there are varying degrees of maturity in children, parents
 4                                                   KEESLERAFBI34-201 29 AUGUST 2002


     will ensure that older children who baby-sit have enough experience to care properly for
     younger children. They must be able to control the children in their care, understand actions
     to be taken, and take proper action for situations that may arise.
     3.3. Latch Key/Home Alone Course and Baby-sitting classes are offered through the Youth
     Center and are highly recommended to better prepare youth to stay home alone and/or to
     baby-sit. Contact the Youth Center at 377-4116.
4. PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES. Supervising children is one of the most important
responsibilities parents have. The ultimate responsibility for the safety, care, well being, and
behavior of dependent children remains with the parent, whether they are personally present to
supervise them or not. Adherence to this policy is meant to ensure the safety of children. Failure
to follow this policy may result in interventions by base authorities and agencies.
