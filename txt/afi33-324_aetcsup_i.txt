                                                Chapter 2

    INTERNAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (REPORT CONTROL SYMBOL REPORTS)

2.1. Report Control Symbol Reports Procedures. This chapter covers procedures for monitoring and
controlling internal reporting requirements that Air Force organizations initiate and impose on other Air
Force organizations or DoD components or that other DoD components initiate and impose on the Air
Force.

2.2. Reports or Information Collections That Require a Control Symbol. Status, summary, or statis-
tical information that is compiled and transmitted from one organizational component to another for man-
agement purposes requires licensing with an RCS. According to DoDD 8910.1, "Information
requirements that have not been properly approved and symbolized (assigned an information require-
ments control symbol) shall not be honored."
    2.2.1. Sometimes it is necessary for an office of primary responsibility (OPR) for a reporting require-
    ment to query a reporting activity about information contained in an established RCS report. These
    requests do not constitute a new reporting requirement.
    2.2.2. An RCS assigned to a reporting requirement does not apply to the submission of additional
    information not contained in the original report and required by intermediate headquarters. The inter-
    mediate headquarters is required to license the requirement for additional information by issuing an
    organizational RCS number.
    2.2.3. Whether information is submitted via a paper report, electronically, or directed insertion of data
    into an electronically accessible database, an RCS is required.

2.3. Information Collections and Reports Managers' Procedures for New and Revised Report Con-
trol Symbol Reports. For each new or revised information requirement, ICR managers:
    2.3.1. Review requests submitted on AF Form 130, Application for a Report Control Symbol, to
    determine if they have been properly justified and meet the requirements in paragraphs 2.3.2. through
    2.3.8.
    2.3.2. Ensure that requesters have performed a cost analysis in accordance with AF Form 130.
    2.3.3. Screen against other licensed information collections for redundancy.
    2.3.4. Determine whether the request requires the collection of personal information on individuals.
    If the request collects personal information on individuals, comply with the procedures in AFI 33-332,
    Air Force Privacy Act Program.
    2.3.5. Review reporting requirements generated in new automated systems with the OPR (paragraph
    2.8.2.). Comply with the procedures in AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records (will convert to
    AFMAN 33-322 Vol. 2), and AFI 33-112, Computer Systems Management.
    2.3.6. Review RCS reports to ensure that they are current. NOTE: All RCS reports receive 3-year
    licenses.
    2.3.7. Rescind RCS reports at the organizational level if their licenses have expired.
AFI33-324_AETCSUP1_I 27 JUNE 2001                                                                       9


   2.3.8. Assign a RCS number at the requester's organizational level to justified and validated reporting
   requirements.
   2.3.9. Maintain appropriate administrative files for each report initiated by their organization. These
   files will include, as a minimum, AF Form 130; a copy of the prescribing directive, letter, or message;
   a copy of associated forms; copies of pertinent correspondence; and copies of supplementing direc-
   tives (if applicable). NOTE: If the prescribing directive is readily available through the OPR, local
   publications library, or electronically, maintenance by the ICR manager is not required.

2.4. Application Procedures for New, Revised, or Revalidated Report Control Symbols. The orga-
nization that generates the reporting requirement must request a RCS number. Generating organizations
submit the information in paragraphs 2.4.1. through 2.4.3. through their component ICR manager when
requesting approval for a new or revised RCS report or when revalidating a report every three years.
   2.4.1. AF Form 130.
   2.4.2. A copy of the title page and pertinent section of the prescribing directive.
       2.4.2.1. You may prescribe a RCS report in a policy letter or message for a one-time report or to
       expedite a recurring reporting requirement prior to implementation in a prescribing directive.
       2.4.2.2. You must put recurring reporting requirements into a prescribing directive within 120
       days. Prescribing directives and policy letters must include:
          2.4.2.2.1. The RCS number and title of the report.
          2.4.2.2.2. What data is submitted, who submits it, when it is due, and where it is sent.
          2.4.2.2.3. An explanation of reporting procedures during emergency conditions as indicated
          by the emergency status code (ESC) on the AF Form 130 (see paragraph 2.6.).
          2.4.2.2.4. An explanation on whether to continue to report data during MINIMIZE if the
          report is sent electronically as indicated on the AF Form 130.
   2.4.3. A copy of any forms used to collect the requested information. NOTE: Forms used to submit
   data for a RCS report must show the RCS number in the upper right corner (AFI 33-360 Vol. 2).

2.5. Functional Approval Authority.
   2.5.1. Determines the information to collect.
   2.5.2. Evaluates the collected information based on the burden imposed on the Air Force.
   2.5.3. Validates and approves the collection of information and perceived value of the RCS report by
   signing the AF Form 130.
   2.5.4. Determines the records retention requirements at all levels and submits an AF Form 525,
   Records Disposition Recommendation, through records management channels as prescribed in AFI
   37-138, Records Disposition—Procedures and Responsibilities (will convert to AFMAN 33-322 Vol.
   3).
   2.5.5. Division Chief or above must sign AF Form 130 for RCS reports at all organizational levels.
   2.5.6. Exceptions:
10                                                            AFI33-324_AETCSUP1_I 27 JUNE 2001


        2.5.6.1. Director or above must sign all AF Forms 130 for RCS reports that project associated
        costs of $250,000 to $500,000.
        2.5.6.2. Deputy Chief of Staff or equivalent level must sign all AF Forms 130 for RCS reports
        that are collected on a weekly or daily frequency and/or have associated costs over $500,000.

2.6. Emergency Status Code. OPRs generating an internal information collection assign an ESC to
guide the reporting procedures during emergency and crisis conditions that may hinder or sufficiently
degrade the ability to collect the data. The status and precedence code assigned to a report should reflect
its need during such conditions.
     2.6.1. The assignment of the ESC is important because a report with a lesser precedence may affect
     another with a higher precedence that could directly affect the wartime mission. It is important to
     examine a report in relation to overall data requirements when assigning an ESC. Many reports affect
     up-channel-reporting requirements.
     2.6.2. Use these codes and their definitions in the directives that prescribe or implement the reporting
     requirement. Include one of the following statements:
        2.6.2.1. This report is designated ESC.
            2.6.2.1.1. Status Code “D” indicates: Immediately discontinue reporting data requirements
            during emergency conditions.
            2.6.2.1.2. Status Code “C1”indicates: Continue reporting during emergency conditions, pri-
            ority precedence. Submit data requirements assigned this category as prescribed or by any
            means to ensure arrival on the established due dates.
            2.6.2.1.3. Status Code “C2” indicates: Continue reporting during emergency conditions, nor-
            mal precedence. Submit data requirements assigned this category as prescribed or by any
            means to ensure arrival on the established due dates.
            2.6.2.1.4. Status Code “C3” indicates: Continue reporting during emergency conditions,
            delayed precedence. Submit data requirements as prescribed, but they may be delayed to
            allow the submission of higher precedence reports. Submit by non-electronic means, if possi-
            ble.

2.7. MINIMIZE. OPRs generating an internal reporting requirement that is sent electronically must
consider reporting procedures during MINIMIZE (see definition in Attachment 1). The prescribing
directive for these reports must include one of the following statements: “CONTINUE REPORTING
DURING MINIMIZE,” or “DISCONTINUE REPORTING DURING MINIMIZE.”

2.8. Licensing Reporting Requirements in Automated Systems.
     2.8.1. An organization developing an automated system must coordinate with the MAJCOM ICR
     manager to ensure all reporting requirements are properly licensed. Coordinate with the Air Force
     IMCO if it is an Air Force-wide system. The OPR for the system should consider what would happen
     to all reports uploaded from one organizational component to another or generated on paper, tape,
     computer-output microfilm, or as output of an electronic database.
     2.8.2. The OPR for a new automated system will comply with reporting requirements in the Elec-
     tronic Records Proposal, as prescribed in AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-322 Vol. 2).
AFI33-324_AETCSUP1_I 27 JUNE 2001                                                                       11


   2.8.3. The MAJCOM ICR manager or the Air Force IMCO will work with the OPR to determine
   what data submissions require a control symbol. Follow procedures in paragraph 2.3. to request the
   appropriate control symbols. NOTE: All output products that collect information for a licensed
   report must display the appropriate control symbol.

2.9. Discontinuing and Superseding a Report Control Symbol Reporting Requirement. O r i g i n a t -
ing organizations that want to discontinue or supersede a RCS reporting requirement must:
   2.9.1. Send written notification to the reporting activities if they have superseded or discontinued a
   RCS report.
   2.9.2. Update the publication that prescribes the RCS report by issuing a revision or an interim
   change to reflect the current status of the reporting requirement. Include this information in the “Sum-
   mary of Revisions” once the publication is rewritten.
   2.9.3. Submit a copy of the written notification and a draft of the revised publication or interim
   change to the component ICR manager or the Air Force IMCO.
   2.9.4. Coordinate with servicing records manager to effect disposition of any accumulated records
   and coordinate on requirement to change any report specific records disposition published in AFMAN
   37-139 (will convert to AFMAN 33-322 Vol. 4).

2.10. Triennial Revalidation.
   2.10.1. The OPR for the RCS report must revalidate the reporting requirement every 3 years accord-
   ing to the procedures in paragraph 2.4. of this instruction.
   2.10.1. (AETC) HQ AETC/SCMC will send a reminder for triennial revalidation.
   2.10.2. The ICR manager/Air Force IMCO identifies any RCS reports that have not been revalidated
   in 3 years and lists them as expired in the organizational component's list of RCS reports or the Air
   Force Internal Information Collections (RCS Reports) at: http://www.afca.scott.af.mil/corp-info/
   icr.htm

2.11. Exemptions from Report Control Symbol Licensing Procedures. DoD and Air Force licensing
procedures exempt the types of internal information requirements described in paragraphs 2.11.1. through
2.11.12.
   2.11.1. Substantive intelligence or counterintelligence reports, personnel security reports, and other
   investigative surveys and reports that relate to safeguarding defense information, protecting DoD
   functions and property, and handling civil disturbances within the United States and its territories and

                              PUBLIC INFORMATION COLLECTIONS

3.1. How The Act Bears on Collecting Information from the Public. Public Law 104-13 and its
implementing regulation, Title 5 CFR Part 1320, cover the policy for collecting information from the pub-
lic. The Act attempts to minimize the Federal paperwork burden on the public. This chapter provides:
3.1. (AETC) How The Act Bears on Collecting Information from the Public. The Paperwork Reduc-
tion Act applies equally to information collected on the worldwide web. If an organization's web site asks
the public, including contractors, for information, whether it is a survey, form, report, or any type of infor-
mation collection device, including paperless, the organization is required by law to obtain approval from
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before the collection can take place. NOTE: This does not
refer to the information provided in response to the general comment portion of a home page.
     3.1.1. The procedures for requesting OMB approval for establishing, revising, and canceling public
     information collections (see Attachment 1, Terms).
     3.1.2. Guidelines on preparing and submitting OMB Form 83-I, Paperwork Reduction Act Submis-
     sion; supporting statements; and pertinent documentation.

3.2. The Scope of The Act. The Act applies to all executive departments, military departments, govern-
ment corporations, government-controlled corporations, and other establishments in the Executive
Branch of the Federal Government. All of the Federal Government's independent regulatory agencies
must adhere to it.

3.3. Agencies Exempt From Licensing Public Information Collections. The Act exempts the follow-
ing agencies from licensing public information collections:
     3.3.1. The Federal Election Commission.
     3.3.2. All Congressional and Judicial Agencies.
     3.3.3. The General Accounting Office (GAO).
     3.3.4. Governments of the District of Columbia and territories and possessions of the United States.
     3.3.5. Government-owned contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities and production operations.

3.4. The Annual Information Collection Budget--RCS: DD-C3I(A)1680, ICB Annual Plan. (See
Attachment 1, Terms.)
     3.4.1. ICR managers will respond to the annual call for projected ICBs.
     3.4.2. Submit your responses to HQ AFCA/ITC, ATTN: Air Force IMCO, 203 W. Losey Street,
     Scott AFB IL 62225-5222.

3.5. New and Revised Public Information Collections. The ICR managers ensure that organizations
requesting public information submit each new and revised request for OMB approval according to para-
graph 3.7.
AFI33-324_AETCSUP1_I 27 JUNE 2001                                                                       15


3.6. Expired Public Information Collections. The OMB licenses a public information collection for
three years, according to The Act. All public information collections carry an expiration date. NOTE: An
expired public information collection is an illegal collection of information and you must discontinue it
until given proper approval.
3.6. (AETC) Expired Public Information Collections. HQ AETC/SCMC will send the OPR a
reminder notice at least 6 months before the OMB licensed public information collection’s expiration
date.

3.7. Office of Management and Budget Approval Application Procedures.
   3.7.1. The organization component that generates the public information collection must request
   approval and licensing from OMB.
   3.7.2. Public information requesters submit the following information to their component ICR man-
   ager:
   3.7.2. (AETC) The HQ AFOATS ICR manager will send all requests for OMB licensed collections
   to the base ICR manager for forwarding to HQ AETC/SCMC.
       3.7.2.1. HQ AFCIC/ITC publishes a 60-day FRN, prescribed in AFI 37-120, Federal Register
       (will convert to AFI 33-320). After the 60-day comment period, HQ AFCIC/ITC sends the pack-
       age to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
       3.7.2.2. An OMB Form 83-I. Include at least two key words from the GAO Thesaurus in item 9.
       The GAO Thesaurus is available on the AFCA web page at www.afca.scott.af.mil/corp-info/
       icr.htm. Comply with the specific instructions in OMB Form 83-I. Use these instructions when
       preparing the OMB Form 83-I and the supporting statement.
       3.7.2.3. A supporting statement (see Attachment 2).
       3.7.2.4. A copy of the instrument of collection in final draft version. If the instrument of collec-
       tion is a form, the agency’s forms management office prepares the final draft according to proce-
       dures in AFI 33-360 Vol. 2.
       3.7.2.5. If the instrument of collection is not a form, contact your ICR manager for instructions on
       referring to an OMB approval number, expiration date, and Agency Disclosure Notice (ADN) on
       the final draft of your survey, questionnaire, or letter. See the ADNs listed in paragraph 3.8.
       3.7.2.6. The title page and pertinent sections of any regulatory and statutory authorities.
       3.7.2.7. If applicable, a letter of justification (paragraphs 3.11. through 3.14.).
       3.7.2.8. A copy of the published FRN.
   3.7.3. The OPR provides the ICR manager the original and four copies of OMB Form 83-I and appli-
   cable documentation listed in paragraph 3.7.2. to HQ AFCA/ITC, ATTN: Air Force IMCO, 203 W.
   Losey Street, Scott AFB IL 62225-5222.

3.8. Agency Disclosure Notice.
   3.8.1. Display the following ADN at the top of the instrument of collection immediately under the
   OMB control number and expiration date: “The public reporting burden for this collection of infor-
   mation is estimated to average XX minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instruc-
16                                                             AFI33-324_AETCSUP1_I 27 JUNE 2001


     tions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and
     reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other
     aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Department
     of Defense, Washington Headquarters Services (WHS), Directorate for Information Operations and
     Reports (DIOR), (XXXX-XXXX [enter 8-digit OMB control number]), 1215 Jefferson Davis High-
     way, Suite 1204, Arlington VA 22202-4302. Respondents should be aware that notwithstanding any
     other provision of law, no person shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection
     of information if it does not display a currently valid OMB control number.” NOTE: Do not return
     your form to the above address. Return completed form to (enter address or instructions as applica-
     ble).
     3.8.1. (AETC) Organizations using a currently approved information collection device on the web
     that displays the OMB approval data are in full compliance with the law. However, information col-
     lected without an OMB approval or continued collection of information after the expiration of OMB
     approval places an organization in violation of public law and will be reported by OMB to the Presi-
     dent and Congress when discovered.

3.9. Processing Time. Allow at least 6 months to process a request for OMB approval. Send the request
through the following channels:
     3.9.1. Submit the FRN with a 60-day comment period through your MAJCOM or HQ USAF func-
     tional ICR manager, who, in-turn, sends the request to the Air Force IMCO. (FOA ICR managers
     must send their requests through their HQ USAF functional ICR manager.)
     3.9.2. After the comment period, submit the OMB Form 83-I package. The Air Force IMCO sends
     the OMB Form 83-I to the DoD Clearance Officer.
     3.9.3. The DoD Clearance Officer forwards the OMB Form 83-I package to OMB and publishes a
     second FRN with a 30-day comment period.
     3.9.4. OMB must rule on the OMB Form 83-I request within 60 days after the 30-day publication
     period in the Federal Register. This 90-day period is used to give the public an opportunity to com-
     ment on this information collection.

3.10. Emergency Processing. Within DoD, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control,
Communications, and Intelligence (ASD [C3I]) may request emergency processing of a collection of
information under the following circumstances:
     3.10.1. When the collection of information is needed prior to the expiration of time periods estab-
     lished in The Act and is essential to the mission of the agency.
     3.10.2. When the agency cannot reasonably comply with normal clearance procedures under The Act,
     reference (g) because: (1) Public harm is reasonably likely to result if normal clearance procedures
     are followed; (2) An unanticipated event has occurred; or (3) The use of normal clearance procedures
     is reasonably likely to cause a statutory or court-ordered deadline to be missed.
     3.10.3. Public harm would be prevented, if for example, strategies to combat a public health epidemic
     depend on information in a survey that needs to be fielded immediately. An example of an unantici-
     pated event would be a natural disaster that has led to the need to provide benefits quickly to the vic-
     tims. The use of emergency clearance procedures is warranted if a new statute is passed that requires
     implementation of an information collection within clearly shorter time frames called for in The Act
AFI33-324_AETCSUP1_I 27 JUNE 2001                                                                        17


   and specify the time period within which OMB should approve or disapprove of the collection (5 CFR
   1320.18). Control numbers assigned to collections of information approved under the "emergency
   processing" procedures are not valid for more than 90 days from the date the agency requested
   approval.
   3.10.4. Prepare each request for emergency processing for the signature of DoD's CIO, the ASD
   (C3I). You must include a justification meeting the guidelines quoted below from 5 CFR 1320.18:
       3.10.4.1. A written determination that the collection of information is essential to the mission of
       the agency and that public harm will result if normal clearance procedures are followed, or that an
       unanticipated event has occurred that will prevent the collection of information or cause a statu-
       tory or judicial deadline to be missed if normal procedures are followed.
       3.10.4.2. Information indicating that it (the agency) has taken all practicable steps to consult with
       interested agencies and members of the public in order to minimize the burden of the collection of
       information.

3.11. Request for Extension. Organizations having primary responsibility for a currently licensed pub-
lic information collection may request a 90-day extension. This request is submitted when additional time
is needed to prepare the request for an OMB review for a collection that is expiring. The request must be
signed by the OPR that signed the OMB Form 83-I. The use of extensions is strongly discouraged by
OMB. Insufficient planning or administrative oversight does not warrant using an extension.

3.12. Out-of-Cycle Requests. The Air Force must identify requests for OMB review for a new public
information collection in the annual Air Force ICB submission. If not, they are considered "out-of-cycle”
requests. Include a letter of explanation regarding why the collection was not included in the Air Force
ICB when requesting approval of an out-of-cycle request.

3.13. Acquisition-/Procurement-Related Public Information Collections. OMB has approved certain
public information collections requested from Federal contractors. Acquisition-/procurement-related
information collections flow through Air Force acquisition channels for licensing when organizations
request them in connection with:
   3.13.1. Specific sections in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
   3.13.2. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).
   3.13.3. Specific sections of the Air Force FAR Supplement (AFFARS) and subordinate agency
   clauses to these regulations.
   3.13.4. All public data collections necessary to comply with the FAR and AFFARS requirements may
   not be currently approved by OMB. Process and approve information collections according to the
   procedures in paragraph 3.7., if OMB has not previously approved them. FAR and DFARS clauses
   require OMB approval through acquisition channels before they are published for Air Force use.
   3.13.5. The inclusion of a reporting or record-keeping requirement in a contract work statement or
   any other contractual provision or exhibit does not fulfill the requirement for an OMB approval or a
   waiver, as appropriate.
   3.13.6. RCS numbers assigned to DoD, HQ USAF, and MAJCOM internal reports do not authorize
   the report or related feeder information to be levied as a public reporting requirement upon any "per-
18                                                           AFI33-324_AETCSUP1_I 27 JUNE 2001


     son" or contractor. Reporting and record-keeping requirements involving the collection of informa-
     tion from non-Federal agencies, Air Force production or service contractors, or other industrial and
     commercial companies or manufacturers are subject to a specific prior public reports clearance. Such
     requirements that are approved are identified by the citation of an OMB approval number or an
     exemption statement, as appropriate.

3.14. Canceling an Office of Management and Budget-Approved Information Collection.
     3.14.1. OPRs must notify ICR managers in writing if they no longer need a public information collec-
     tion.
     3.14.2. The ICR managers send the cancellation notification to HQ AFCA/ITC, ATTN: Air Force
     IMCO, 203 W. Losey Street, Scott AFB IL 62225-5222.
     3.14.3. The Air Force IMCO then sends the request for cancellation to WHS/DIOR who informs the
     OMB.

3.15. Generic Clearance Streamline Process. The OMB has devised the "generic clearance" to
streamline the clearance process in "Resource Manual for Customer Surveys." A generic clearance is a
master plan for conducting one or more data collections termed "tasks." Review occurs in two steps: A
full review of the overall plan followed by quick review of the actual details of each task.
     3.15.1. Scope. The generic clearance involves advance approval of a well-defined class of low bur-
     den data collection. The tasks are not fully defined until used. An example of this type of clearance
     would encompass a series of customer satisfaction surveys. A generic clearance typically includes a
     set of agreements negotiated between the sponsoring agency and OMB, establishing data collection
     and usage, a burden cap, a periodic reporting requirement to update the OMB docket, and a commit-
     ment by OMB to review any specific application quickly.
     3.15.2. Requirements. You must subject the overall plan to the full clearance process and the 60-day
     FRN must provide the public with a basis for comment similar to a collection approved under normal
     clearance procedures.

3.16. Exemptions to Office of Management and Budget Licensing Procedures. Organizations need
not submit public information collections described in paragraphs 3.16.1. through 3.16.16. for OMB
approval:
     3.16.1. Affidavits, oaths, affirmations, certifications, receipts, changes of address, consents, or
     acknowledgments, provided that they entail no burden other than that necessary to identify the respon-
     dent (name, address, and identification number). However, any of these documents requesting
     respondents to provide information relating to the information being certified would require OMB
     approval.
     3.16.2. Samples of products or of any other physical objects.
     3.16.3. Facts or opinions obtained by direct observation by an employee or agent of the sponsoring
     agency or in response to non-standardized oral communication in connection with such direct obser-
     vation.
     3.16.4. Facts or opinions submitted in response to general solicitations of comments from the general
     public, provided that no respondent is required to supply specific information pertaining to a com-
AFI33-324_AETCSUP1_I 27 JUNE 2001                                                                         19


  ment, other than that necessary for self-identification, as a condition to the agency's full consideration
  of the comment.
  3.16.5. Information from individuals (including those in control groups) under treatment or clinical
  examination in connection with research on, or prophylaxis to prevent, a clinical disorder, direct treat-
  ment of that disorder, or the interpretation of biological analyses of body fluids, tissues, or other spec-
  imens, or the identification or classification of such disorders.
  3.16.6. Facts or opinions requested from a single person. However, if the law requires the request or
  it is necessary to obtain a benefit, you must inform the proposed respondent that the collection is not
  subject to OMB approval because it is addressed to nine or fewer persons. The absence of such a
  statement may result in the imposition of the public protection clause of The Act.
  3.16.7. Examinations designed to test the aptitude, abilities, or knowledge of the persons tested and
  the collection of information for identification in connection with such examinations.
  3.16.8. Facts or opinions obtained or solicited at or in connection with public hearings or meetings.
  3.16.9. Information solicited through non-standardized follow-up questions designed to clarify
  responses to approved collections of information.
  3.16.10. Like items so designated by OMB.
  3.16.11. Collections of information from Federal employees within the scope of their employment,
  unless you plan to use the results for general statistical purposes.
  3.16.12. Members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty and their family members, and retired
  members of the Armed Forces when they are surveyed within the context of the FY 1986 Defense
  Authorization Act, Section 804, Surveys of Military Families.
  3.16.13. Information collections addressed to nine or fewer persons; however, agencies are required
  to ensure that collections of information required by law or necessary to obtain a benefit, and which
  are submitted to nine or fewer persons, inform potential respondents that the collection of information
  is not subject to OMB review under The Act.
  3.16.14. Collections of information conducted by compulsory process pursuant to the Antitrust Civil
  Process Act or Section 13 of the Federal Trade Commission Improvements Act of 1980.
  3.16.15. Collections of information during the conduct of intelligence activities as defined in Sections
  3.4e and 3.4f of Executive Order 12333, United States Intelligence Activities, December 4, 1981, or
  successor orders; and during the conduct of cryptoanalytic activities that are communications security
  activities.
  3.16.16. Collections of information during the conduct of Federal criminal, civil, or administrative
  action with respect to a specific party. This exemption is a limited one. It applies only after a case file
  or its equivalent is opened with respect to a particular party. It does not apply prior to the opening of
  such file, and therefore does not apply to:
     3.16.16.1. Complaints or allegations of individuals or other persons that form the basis for the
     agency's subsequent opening of a case file, even though the file is opened immediately upon
     receipt of the complaint allegation.
     3.16.16.2. General investigations that are not focused on a particular party.

     3.16.16.3. General collections of information about a category of individuals or entities such as a
     class of licensees or an industry.

Terms
Agency Disclosure Notice (ADN)—The ADN is a statement used for public information collections. It
is put on the instrument of collection as close to the current OMB control number as practicable. It is the
agency’s disclosure of the estimated average burden hours per response and a request that the public direct
any comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and any suggestions for reducing this
burden to the agency and to OMB’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA).
Current Federal Employees and Military Personnel—Current employees of the Federal Government
and military personnel, IF, the collection of information is addressed to them in their capacity as
individual private citizens (e.g., they file income tax returns, census forms, or other survey, or
administrative forms in the same manner as persons not currently employed by the Federal Government
or serving in the Armed Forces). EXCEPTION: Current employees of the Federal Government, military
personnel, military reservists, and members of the National Guard are not considered members of the
public when they are asked to provide information that falls within the scope of their employment and
when asked for information about their duty status.
Federal Agency—A department, independent agency, commission, or establishment of the Executive
Branch.
Information Collection Budget (ICB)—The Federal Government’s projected burden on the public for
new requirements to collect information. It is the estimated response time (direct and indirect) for the
public to collect, record, and submit information to the Federal Government. Each year the OMB issues
a “budget call” for the Federal Government’s ICB.
Interagency Report—Data or information transmitted between or among Federal agencies for use in
determining policy; planning, controlling, and evaluating operations and performance; making
administrative determinations; or preparing other reports. The data or information may be displayed on
paper, magnetic tapes, or other media.
Internal Information Collection/Reporting Requirement—Data or information collected by one or
more organizational components and transmitted to other organizational components for management
purposes. The collections required for management purposes pertain to policy; planning, controlling, and
evaluating operations and performance; making administrative determinations; and preparing other
reports. It is status, summary, or statistical information in both electronic and manual information
AFI33-324_AETCSUP1_I 27 JUNE 2001                                                                         27


systems.
License—Pertaining to an Air Force approval information collection/report process. Air Force
information collections or reports are licensed once the Air Force Information Manager Control Officer or
OMB approves the information collection. A license is good for 3 years.
MINIMIZE—A procedure used during periods of crisis or other abnormal periods to reduce the volume
of record and long distance telephone traffic ordinarily transmitted electrically. MINIMIZE applies to all
users of DoD communications systems. When MINIMIZE is imposed, users of DoD electrical
communications must determine that: The information to be sent is required to avoid a seriously
detrimental impact on mission accomplishment or safety of life; electrical transmission is the only way to
get the information to the addressee in sufficient time to accomplish the purpose. (Allied
Communications Publication [ACP]121/USSUP1)
Operating Document—A completed form or other document used to facilitate, accomplish, or provide a
description or record of a transaction, function, or event. The information in an operating document may
provide data or input for a report, but that is not its primary purpose. Examples of operating documents
include application forms, purchase orders, personnel actions, bills of lading, payrolls and time sheets,
inspection or audit reports, and reports that involve direct command and control of military forces or
cryptological activities related to national security.
Public Burden or Burden Hours—The total time, effort, or financial resources required to respond to a
collection of information, including the time it takes to read or hear instructions; to develop, modify,
construct, or assemble any materials or equipment; to conduct tests, inspections, polls, observations, or
the like necessary to obtain the information; to organize the information into the requested format; to
review its accuracy and the appropriateness of its manner of presentation; and to maintain, disclose, or
report the information.
Public Information Collections—Those collections that require responses from the public. The Act
defines a collection of information to be: “The obtaining or soliciting of facts or opinions by an agency
through the use of written report forms, application forms, schedules, questionnaires, reporting or record
keeping requirements, or other similar methods calling for either: (1) Answers to identical questions
posed to, or identical reporting or record keeping requirements imposed on, ten or more persons, other
than agencies, instrumentalities, or employees of the United States; or (2) Answers to questions posed to
agencies, instrumentalities, or employees of the United States which are to be used for general statistical
purposes.” This includes information collections that are mandatory, voluntary, or required to obtain a
benefit.
Public or Person—(as defined in 5 CFR 1320) Members of the public, or the term “person,” include
individuals, partnerships, associations, corporations (including government-owned contractor-operated
[GOCO] facilities), business trusts, legal representatives, organized group of individuals, state, territory,
or local government. As to particular categories of “person,” OMB has determined: (1) Retired Federal
Employees and Military Personnel on Inactive Status: The definition of “person” includes retired and
other former Federal civilian employees. It includes retired and inactive military personnel, reservists and
members of the National Guard unless you require information about their duty status. (The FY 1986
Defense Authorization Act, Section 804, states that the Secretary of Defense may conduct surveys of
members of the Armed Forces serving on active duty, families of such members, and retired members of
the Armed Forces to determine the effectiveness of existing Federal programs relating to military families
and the need for new programs. In this context, consider them to be employees of the United States and

not members of the public.) (2) Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC): ROTC cadets are considered
employees of the United States for purposes of 44 United States Code (U.S.C.) 3502, Public Printing and
Documents, “Coordination of Federal Information Policy,” when providing information to instructors
during classroom and other training activities. ROTC cadets under contract may be asked to provide
further information, as employees of the United States, provided that the information they give remains
entirely within the scope of their employment. (NOTE: For surveys of Air Force personnel see AFI
36-2601, Air Force Personnel Survey Program. Unless exempt, they may require licensing.)
Public Protection Clause—Regardless of any other provision of law, no person can be penalized for
failure to comply with any collection of information that does not display a currently valid OMB control
number; or, in the case of information required by law or to obtain a benefit that is submitted to nine or
fewer persons, fail to state that it is not subject to OMB review under The Act. If an agency has imposed
a collection of information as a means to satisfy or prove a condition for receiving a benefit, or to prevent
a penalty, and the information collection does not display a currently valid OMB control number, the
agency won’t treat a person’s failure to comply as grounds for withholding the benefit or imposing the
penalty. The agency shall instead permit respondents to prove or satisfy the legal conditions in any other
reasonable manner (5 CFR 1320.4).
Report Control Symbol (RCS)—A standard agency designation (control number) for a report
consisting of letters or numbers indicating that the report has been reviewed and approved according to
DoD- and Air Force-directed procedures.
Similar Methods—(as specified in the definition of “Public Information Collections” in this glossary)
“Similar methods” includes contracts, agreements, policy statements, plans, rules or regulations, planning
requirements, circulars, directives, instructions, bulletins, requests for proposals or other procurement
requirements, telegraphic or telephonic requests, and standard questionnaires used to monitor compliance
with agency requirements.

Figure A2.1. Sample Supporting Statement.

1. Justification. The justification for gathering personal data on volunteers for the United States Air
Force Museum System (USAFMS) follows:

1.1. The USAFMS consists of the Air Force’s National Museum at Wright-Patterson AFB OH, Air Force
field museums, Air Force historical holdings, and airparks. The USAFMS is responsible for the acquisi-
tion, care, control, and disposition of all Air Force historical property. The USAF Museum depicts the
general history of the Air Force. It maintains the prime Air Force historical collection for the Air Force
and is responsible for preserving the Air Force’s material culture and heritage. The museum’s Manager of
Volunteer Services is responsible for providing quality volunteers to assist in all areas of the museum’s
operation, and freeing salaried staff to fulfill their management, operations, and education responsibili-
ties. The use of volunteers in military museum programs is authorized by Title 10 U.S.C. Chapter 81 Sec-
tion 1588, and regulated within the Air Force by Air Force Instruction 84-103, Museum System. The
museum encourages teamwork between salaried staff and volunteers so visitors are provided the best pos-
sible service. Volunteers contribute unique talent, skill, and knowledge of aviation history, as well as their
valuable time, to provide personalized attention to the public. Information collected on the AF Form
3569, USAF Museum System Volunteer Application/Registration will be used by the volunteer pro-
gram manager to determine applicant preferences for work assignment, special skills the applicant has,
and the amount of time the applicant is willing to donate to the museum program. Basic personal data
(name, address, telephone, etc.) will be used to contact the applicant after the application has been
reviewed and a decision made on selection or rejection. Selection and work assignments throughout the
museum will be based largely on the information provided on AF Form 3569. The form also will aid the
volunteer program manager in determining the most effective means of recruitment. Emergency data is
required to contact next of kin in the event of an emergency involving the volunteer.
1.2. Members of the public desiring to volunteer their time and talent to the USAF Museum Program will
complete this information collection. Museums throughout the USAFMS will use the information pro-
vided to evaluate and select volunteers for their museum programs. If the data contained in the AF Form
3569 is not available, the museum system will have no meaningful way to select volunteers and match
applicant skills and desires with individual museum needs.
1.3. Other methods were considered; however, there is no technological alternative. The data requested
and the means of obtaining it have been reduced to the simplest level. No mailings are made; the data is
collected at the museum; and the applicants provide it as they complete the form without the need of out-
side assistance.
1.4. Other Air Force programs were researched to determine the potential for duplication; the only other
organized Air Force use of volunteers is in the area of family support. This form does not duplicate any
document or form used in that program.
1.5. There is no similar information available.

1.6. This collection of information does not involve small businesses or other small entities.
1.7. Data is collected only once for each applicant; it cannot be collected less frequently.
1.8. The collection of information is not inconsistent with the guidelines in Title 5 Code of Federal Reg-
ulations (CFR) 1320.6.
1.9. Personal and telephone contacts were made in 1990 to USAF museums and agencies, non-Air Force
museums, and nonprofit agencies for the purpose of examining and comparing different methods used to
collect written, personal information from new volunteers. The number of outside organizations repre-
sented by these agencies is unknown.

1.9.2. Results revealed that record-keeping requirements differ. Our conclusion was to develop a form to
fit the needs of the USAF Museum and the USAF Museum Program. No other public contacts were
made.
1.10. The Privacy Act statement on the AF Form 3569 assures compliance with the Privacy Act. Respon-
dents are assured that only Air Force Museum personnel to effectively place the applicant in the
USAFMS Volunteer Program use the information.
1.11. No sensitive information is requested.

1.13. It will take 500 annual applicants 30 minutes each to complete the form; 30 minutes x 500 = 250
annual burden hours. This information collection was not included in the FY 94 DoD Information Collec-
tion Budget (ICB) because it is a new requirement identified after budget submissions were completed.
1.14.This is a new form; therefore, the annual 250-hour burden is an increase to the OMB inventory.
1.15. Results will not be published.
1.16. Collections of Information Employing Statistical Methods. This collection of information does not
employ statistical methods.
