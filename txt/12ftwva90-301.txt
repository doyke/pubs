The Inspector General Complaints Resolution Program is prescribed in AFI 90-301. Air Force and civilian
members have a duty to promptly report Fraud, Waste, Abuse (FWA) or gross mismanagement; violations of law,
policy, procedures, or regulations; an injustice; abuse of authority; misconduct; inappropriate conduct; and
deficiencies, or like conditions, to the appropriate supervisor or commander, to an IG or other appropriate inspector,
or through an established grievance channel.

You have the right to file an IG complaint at any level, but experience has shown that many complaints can be
resolved through the chain of command. For this reason, although not required to, you are encouraged to discuss
your concerns with your chain of supervision and/or commander before coming to the IG. If you wish to file a
complaint, contact the Complaints Resolution Office at:
