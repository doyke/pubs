This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-25, Emergency
Management. The Inspection Checklist is developed to support AFI 90-201, Inspector General
Activities, and AFI 90-201USAFESUP, Inspector General Activities. This checklist is intended
for inspection use. It applies to all installations in the United States Air Forces in Europe
(USAFE) It does not apply to Air National Guard (ANG) or US Air Force Reserve (AFRC)
units. Send comments and suggested improvements to this publication on AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication, to Readiness Division, HQ USAFE/A7X, Unit
3050 Box 10, APO AE 09094-5010. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at:
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This checklist has been changed substantially to reflect changes in AFI 10 -2501, AF Emergency
Management Program, Planning and Operations. It should be reviewed in its entirety to ensure
compliance.

 1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the inspection or
 assessment. As a minimum, units should use the Functional Inspection Guide in conjunction
 with the Unit Self-Assessment. The objective is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment
 of required capabilities. Higher headquarters may use this guide in whole or in part during visits
 or exercises. This checklist applies to the Installation Commander’s Emergency Management
 Program. Though the Civil Engineer administers the program, the AFI implies cross-functional
 responsibilities.
     1.1. Core Compliance Guide Items (CCGI) and Compliance Guide Items (CGI). Items
     identified by functional managers to prioritize command requirements and to allow the
     Inspector General (HQ USAFE/IG) inspectors to assess criticality of deficiencies.
         1.1.1. CCGI. Items identified by HQ USAFE directorates and functional managers as
         key result areas for successful mission accomplishment including, but not limited to,
         items where non-compliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost,
         litigation or affect system reliability. These requirements may be mandated by law,
         Executive Order, DoD directive, safety or Air Force and USAFE strategic plans. CCGIs
         are referred to as significant guide items requiring direct IG evaluation. Identify CCGIs
         by using bold letters.
         1.1.2. CGI. CGI are areas that require special vigilance and are important to the overall
         performance of the unit. Noncompliance could result in some negative impact on
         mission performance but is not likely to result in injury, unnecessary cost, or litigation.
         Identify CGIs by using standard sentence case.
