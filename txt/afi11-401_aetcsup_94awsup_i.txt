                                            Chapter 1

     RESPONSIBILITY AND OBLIGATIONS, FLIGHT AUTHORIZATIONS, AND
                      FOREIGN MILITARY FLYING

Section 1A—Responsibilities and Obligations

1.1. Who Must Comply. The policies and requirements of this instruction apply to all
personnel who fly onboard Air Force aircraft, and their commanders. In addition, it provides
guidance on the Jump Record Folder (JRF), Aviation Service Codes (ASC), and flight
authorization (FA) codes in Table A2.3 for Air Force parachutists. Further guidance on
parachutist policies and requirements can be found in AFI 11-410,Personnel Parachute
Operations.
1.2. Responsibilities of AF/A3O-A. The Director of Air Operations (AF/A3O-A):
    1.2.1. Establishes and monitors the Air Force flying program as outlined in this instruction to
    ensure effective use of resources.
    1.2.2. Assigns AF/A3O-AT as the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for this
    instruction.
1.3. Responsibilities of MAJCOMs. MAJCOM/A3s will provide oversight of MAJCOM
flying programs. MAJCOMs will establish a system to carry out the requirements of this
instruction and to meet training and operational needs of the Air Force.
1.3. (AETC) Responsibilities of MAJCOMs. HQ AETC/A2/3/10 or delegated representative
is the approval authority for all flying or operating aircraft procured through non-DoD resources.
    1.3.1. MAJCOM Commanders will prohibit any agency or unit from operating or
    maintaining an aircraft that does not have an established system program director. Waiver
    authority is MAJCOM/A3; coordinate waivers with MAJCOM/A4. Aircraft procured
    through non-DoD resources will not be flown or operated by USAF units without MAJCOM
    approval.
    1.3.2. MAJCOM Commanders may direct grounding of MDS-specific or all aircraft within
    their commands for maintenance reasons. When a MAJCOM has lead command aircraft
    responsibility, MAJCOM commanders may recommend grounding of all aircraft within an
    MDS-specific fleet. MAJCOM Commanders may also direct a stand-down of aircrew
    personnel when warranted by operational considerations, in conjunction with aircraft
    grounding or as a separate action. A stand-down has no immediate impact on the operational
    status of any unit aircraft; it is the result of an operational unit commander directing unit
    aircrews not to fly for a specific reason. A stand-down provides the commander time to
    assess an incident or finding and actions required to safely resume operations. Notification
    will be provided IAW AFI 10-206,Operational Reporting. See also AFI 21-101,Aircraft and
    Equipment Maintenance Management, for additional guidance. Return to normal operations
    will be initiated by the MAJCOM Commander directing the original grounding/stand-down.
    Authority for grounding and/or stand-down may be delegated by MAJCOMs in supplements
    to this and other governing AFIs, but not lower than MAJCOM/A3/A4.
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                       9


  1.3.3. Interfly Guidance. Lead MAJCOMs will place interfly guidance (if applicable) in
  aircraft-specific AFI 11-2MDS-Specific, Volumes 3. As required, establish additional
  interfly guidance in MAJCOM supplements to this AFI. Interfly agreements must be
  approved prior to flight. Ensure unit coordination. Ensure required information is provided to
  members‘ Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) offices.
  1.3.3. (AETC) If specific guidance regarding interfly procedures is not addressed in the AFI
  11-2 mission design series (MDS), Volume 3, units will fly aircrew and other military
  members, according to paragraph 1.10 of the basic instruction, and obtain OG/CC-to-OG/CC
  written approval. If the interfly approval is time driven or an emergency (i.e., an emergency
  evacuation), verbal approval from the unit commander or higher is authorized.
  1.3.4. Ensure no aircrew member is assigned Flying Status Code (FSC) ―S‖ ( Table 2.6)
  (except Duty Not Involving Flying [DNIF] members) or ASC ―04‖ ( Table 2.5) beyond 180
  days without being disqualified for aviation service, returned to flying, or reassigned to non-
  flying status/duty. MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent is the waiver authority for the 180-day limit.
  MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority to extend members in this status beyond 365 days.
  Send information copy to AF/A3O-AT for all cases waived beyond 365 days. NOTE: For
  members previously in DNIF status, the 180-day period begins on the date the member was
  cleared to perform flying duties.
  1.3.4. (AETC) HQ AETC/A3F is the waiver authority for the 180-day limit. HQ
  AETC/A2/3/10 is the waiver authority to extend members in this status beyond 365 days.
  Send information copy to HQ USAF/A3O-AT for all cases waived beyond 365 days. Note:
  Route all requests through HQ AETC/A3FV prior to requesting approval from HQ
  AETC/A2/3/10 or HQ AETC/A3F. Exception: See paragraph 1.10.1.10 (Added) for interfly
  of instructors in AETC flying training programs.
  1.3.5. Ensure FSC ―K‖ (Table 2.6) is used only for aircrew members assigned to an active
  Aircrew Position Indicator (API), but not authorized to fly due to lack of resources (aircraft,
  flying hours, etc.). To ensure the requirement for active flying is still valid, each position
  occupied by a member assigned FSC ―K‖ must be revalidated by the MAJCOM/A3 at the
  end of each fiscal year. The member‘s commander will submit a request for revalidation
  through group channels for MAJCOM/A3 approval. Upon completion of the revalidation,
  send notification to the member‘s Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) office
  authorizing the continuance of FSC ―K.‖ Send an information copy to AF/A3O-AT. See
  paragraph 1.4.1.9 for additional guidance. EXCEPTION: MAJCOM/A3 revalidation is not
  required for FSC ―K‖ assigned to members deployed to a non-flying assignment.
     1.3.5.1. FSC ―K‖ is not authorized when aircrew members are double billeted due to
     permanent change of station PCS or permanent change of assignment PCA actions.
  1.3.6. Review all cases when a rated officer with longer than 18 years of aviation service and
  assigned to an active flying position, or a CEA with longer than 20 years of aviation service
  and assigned to an active flying position, has not flown for 180 days and is not in suspension,
  disqualification, or DNIF status. Review will determine whether the member should be
  disqualified from aviation service, reassigned to an inactive flying position, or returned to
  flying.

     1.3.6. (AETC) The Host Aviation Resource Management (HARM) office will notify the
     OG/CC, in writing through the squadron commander (SQ/CC), of individuals who have not
     flown for 180 days and who are not in suspension, disqualification, or duty not involving
     flying (DNIF) status. The OG/CC will make a recommendation to HQ AETC/A3F for final
     approval on whether the individual should be disqualified from aviation service, reassigned
     to an inactive flying position, or returned to flying.
1.4. Responsibilities of Subordinate Organizations.
     1.4.1. Commanders are responsible for compliance with the requirements of this instruction.
     Commanders will:
        1.4.1.1. Issue orders and supervise all personnel assigned or attached to their command
        for flying duties.
        1.4.1.2. Establish procedures to ensure all flights are reviewed for flight feasibility.
        Commanders may direct a stand-down of unit flying operations when warranted by
        maintenance, operational, or safety considerations. Provide notification IAW AFI 10-206.
        1.4.1.3. Ensure compliance with appropriate instructions, and adequate crew preparation
        for safe conduct of flight.
        1.4.1.4. Verify aircrew members‘ qualification before assignment to an aircrew position.
        1.4.1.5. Notify the HARM office within 10 days of the beginning of any investigations
        that may affect an aircrew member‘s aviation service.
        1.4.1.6. Notify the MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent office when a rated officer with longer
        than 18 years of aviation service and assigned to an active flying position, or a CEA with
        longer than 20 years of aviation service and assigned to an active flying position, has not
        flown for 180 days and is not in suspension, disqualification, or DNIF status.
        1.4.1.7. Ensure aircrew members that have been disqualified for aviation service have
        the appropriate disqualification aeronautical order (AO) published, even if the member
        may have already separated or was dismissed from the Air Force. Every effort should be
        made to accomplish the disqualification action before the aircrew member is separated or
        dismissed.
        1.4.1.8. Ensure aircrew members assigned FSC ―S‖ or ASC ―04‖ do not exceed 180 days
        in this status without obtaining approval from the MAJCOM/A3T. If an extension is
        required, the member‘s unit commander will submit the request for an extension/waiver
        prior to the 180-day limit. If a waiver of the 180-limit was previously approved IAW
        Paragraph 1.3.4, the member‘s unit commander must again obtain waiver approval prior
        to the member exceeding 365 days in FSC ―S‖ or ASC ―04‖ status. AFI 11-402,Aviation
        and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, provides applicable guidance
        for suspensions/disqualifications. See Paragraph 3.1.6.4for additional guidance.
        1.4.1.8. (AETC) See paragraph 1.3.4 of this supplement for approval authority for 180-
        and 365-day extensions. The HARM office will notify the OG/CC, in writing through the
        SQ/CC, of individuals who have been in flying status code (FSC) S (inactive
        nonperformance) and aviation service code (ASC) 04 for 150 and 335 days. The OG/CC
        must decide within 10 days whether the aircrew member will be returned to flying,
        reassigned to nonflying, or recommended for disqualification. The OG/CC will route
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                     11


     waiver requests through NAF/DO prior to requesting HQ AETC/A2/3/10 or HQ
     AETC/A3F approval.
         1.4.1.8.1. (Added-AETC) If a member remains in ASC 04 status pending a flying
         evaluation board (FEB), the OG/CC or equivalent will forward a notification
         memorandum through HQ AETC/A3F to HQ AETC/A2/3/10.
         1.4.1.8.2. (Added-AETC) Approval of ASC 04 beyond 180 days, through 364 days,
         is automatic if the member is pending FEB action. However, a waiver from HQ
         AETC/A2/3/10 is required if a member remains past 365 days, according to
         paragraph 1.3.4 of the basic instruction.
     1.4.1.9. Unit commanders will obtain OG/CC or equivalent approval for assignment of
     FSC ―K‖ and provide the approval source document to the servicing HARM office for
     publication of the AO. The approval document will contain justification. Provide an
     information copy to the MAJCOM/A3. (EXCEPTION: A member‘s commander will
     submit a letter to the servicing HARM office directing assignment of FSC ―K‖ for return
     to aviation service as a result of an FEB, or when the aircraft was deactivated and/or unit
     closed when the member is still assigned to an active billet pending
     reassignment. MAJCOM/A3 notification is not required for these exceptions. Use the
     letter approving return to aviation service as the source document to publish an AO to
     assign FSC ―K‖ for members returned to service as the result of an FEB. Use the
     notification letter from the unit commander to publish an AO to assign FSC ―K‖ to
     members inactive due to aircraft deactivation and/or unit closure.
         1.4.1.9.1. (Added) In all cases, the HARM office will publish the AO, with
         explanatory remarks, and file the notification memo permanently on the left side of
         the FRF. If required, the OG/CC will submit a revalidation request to the
         MAJCOM/A3 no later than 30 September (see paragraph 1.3.5). Upon receipt, the
         HARM office will permanently file on the left side of the member‘s FRF all letters
         assigning FSC ―K‖ and all MAJCOM/A3 revalidation approvals.
  1.4.2. Commanders, including nonflying unit commanders, manage assigned aircrew and
  parachutist members and coordinate changes affecting aircrew members‘ flying status and
  parachutist members" jump status with the HARM office. NOTE: This includes all Air Force
  Reserve Command Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) flyers assigned to active duty
  units at gaining MAJCOMs.
     1.4.2.1. Commanders will manage rated and CEA aircrew positions IAW AFI 11-412,
     Aircrew Management. API 5, 6, 8, B, and D coded positions may be double-billeted and
     both members may actively fly for up to 30 calendar days. On or before the 30th day, the
     commander will identify which aircrew member to assign inactive flying activity, FSC H.
     MAJCOM/A3 may waive this paragraph to allow double-billeting and active flying for
     no longer than 180 calendar days. This waiver authority will not be delegated lower than
     the MAJCOM/A3.
         1.4.2.1.1. (DELETED) .
     1.4.2.2. Commanders will manage non-rated aircrew and parachutist positions IAW AFI
     11-402.

        1.4.2.3. Commanders will ensure aircrew/parachutist members and/or unit orderly rooms
        notify the base HARM office of all non-flying/non-parachuting TDYs, projected PCS,
        retirement, or separation actions. This requirement can be met by forwarding copies of all
        aircrew/parachutist members‘ TDY, permanent change of station (PCS), retirement, or
        separation orders to the base HARM office to process required AO or ARMS actions.
            1.4.2.3.1. Commanders will ensure aircrew/parachutist members pick up their
            FRF/JRF from the HARM office prior to final outprocessing for PCS assignments.
            1.4.2.3.2. Commanders will ensure aircrew/parachutist members and/or unit orderly
            rooms notify the HARM office prior to a permanent change of assignment (PCA)
            action.

     1.5.1. Safely and effectively use available flying and parachute jump resources to obtain and
     maintain aircrew or parachutist qualification when assigned to active flying or jump billets.
     See AFI 11-402 for guidance pertaining to failure of members to accomplish aircrew or
     parachutist training requirements.
        1.5.1.1. Squadron Aviation Resource Management (SARM) or Tenant Aviation
        Resource Management (TARM) offices will assign aircrew or parachutist training
        requirements in ARMS to all fliers/jumpers assigned to active flying/jumping billets.
     1.5.2. Accomplish an annual flight or jump records review in the HARM office (except for
     geographically separated units [GSU]) to validate aviation/parachutist service actions and the
     record of flying or jump accomplishments during the previous year. HARM offices may e-
     mail annual record review documents to a GSU for a member‘s review and certification.
     Member will complete the review not later than the end of the member‘s birth month.
     Member will acknowledge the review by either sending a signed Individual Data Summary
     (IDS) to the HARM office or by providing an e-mail reply confirming the review was
     completed. File review documentation with the IDS in the FRF/JRF. (Does not apply to
     cadets who do not have FRF/JRF requirements.)
     1.5.2. (AETC) Geographically separated unit (GSU) Squadron Aviation Resource
     Management (SARM) offices will ensure aircrew members receive and accomplish annual
     record reviews prior to due dates. The HARM servicing the separated units will notify the
     OG/CC and GSU/CC in writing 15 days prior to due dates of individuals who have not
     accomplished their annual record review. GSU/CC will ensure the aircrew members review
     and return certified documents to the servicing HARM prior to the due date.
        1.5.2.1. Certification is acknowledgement by the member that the flying/jump data is
        correct. Information maintained in the FRF or JRF will not be changed without official
        source documentation. For example an AFTO Form 781 or AF Form 3520 for missing
        flights and sorties, AETC Form 240-5 for student hours, an AF Form 922 or AF Form
        4323 for missing jumps, Military ID or re-enlistment paperwork for date of separation
        change and personnel data that did not interface to ARMS, etc. In the absence of source
        documents, the member may submit a DD Form 149 to the Air Force Board for
        Corrections to Military Records (AFBCMR) IAW Air Force Pamphlet 36-

     logbook, or letter (submitted under previous Air Force policy) must be filed on the left
     side of the FRF IAW AFI 11-421,Aviation Resource Management.
         1.5.2.1.1. AF/A3O-AT is OPR for AFBCMR requests. AF/A3O-AT may contact
         HARM offices directly to obtain documents for review/validation, to expedite
         corrective action if an AFBCMR request is received, or expedite corrective action to
         ARMS data received on the Consolidated Headquarters Aviation Resource
         Management System (CHARM) report (RCS: HAF-A3O [M&AR] 0701).
     1.5.2.2. Inactive aircrew/jump personnel will accomplish a records review within 120
     days prior to PCS. They are not required to accomplish annual reviews of their FRF/JRF.
     1.5.2.3. Aircrew/jump personnel suspended or disqualified for aviation service will
     accomplish a FRF/JRF review within 30 days of the suspension or disqualification action.
     Geographically separated members will acknowledge the review by either sending a
     signed Individual Data Summary (IDS) to the HARM office or by providing an e-mail
     reply confirming the review was completed. NOTE: (DELETED).
  1.5.3. Ensure the HARM office maintaining the FRF or JRF is aware of a pending PCS. The
  HARM office must be advised of the proposed departure date, date of last flight or jump
  before departure, and date the individual will pick up the FRF or JRF. Member must notify
  the HARM office at least five days prior to departure, if applicable. Validate flights
  accomplished before departing PCS and sign ARMS generated PCS products IAW AFI 11-
  421.

     1.5.3.2. (DELETE) .
     1.5.3.3. (DELETE) .
  1.5.4. Pick up the Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF), Flying History Report (FHR), FRF or JRF
  before departing for PCS or flying/jumping TDY (ref. para 3.1.4.1). Members must ensure
  they have a copy of their current AO, IDS, and ARMS training summary, prior to departure
  on a jump/flying TDY. Members initiating parachutist status, scheduled to attend jump
  school, must give the HARM office a copy of their TDY orders at least 5 work-days prior to
  TDY, to allow processing of the initial AO authorizing jump status.
  1.5.5. Turn in the FRF or JRF to the proper HARM office (or notify the HARM office that
  the record was mailed) within 10 duty-days after arriving at a new duty station (includes
  flying TDY). Inactive aircrew members must also turn in the FRF and FEF within 10 duty
  days. If a member does not turn in the FRF within the 10 workday limit, the HARM office
  will suspend aviation career incentive pay (ACIP), career enlisted flyer incentive pay
  (CEFIP), or hazardous duty incentive pay (HDIP) (via a Military Pay Order [MPO]) until
  receipt of the FRF for validation of qualification. HARM offices will consider mailed records
  as ―turned in‖ and will not suspend incentive pay for these members. HARM offices will
  make every effort to contact the member prior to stopping incentive pay. HARM offices will
  ensure FRFs/JRFs are inprocessed to the ARMS database NLT 10 calendar days after receipt
  of the records.

NOTES:
     1. The losing HARM office will mail the FRF to the gaining HARM office if the member‘s
        next duty location is not collocated with the gaining HARM office.
     2. (Added) Stopping Incentive Pay for Failure to Turn In Flight Records. HARM
        offices will publish an aeronautical order to assign Aviation Service Code ―04‖ when
        stopping incentive pay IAW paragraph 1.5.5. Upon receipt of the member‘s FRF/JRF,
        the HARM office will revoke the suspension and retroactively restore incentive pay, if
        the member is otherwise qualified.
     1.5.5. (AETC) Active flying personnel will not be scheduled for flight/jump activity until
     the HARM office receives the flight record folder (FRF) or jump record folder (JRF).
        1.5.5.1. Aircrew members and parachutists assigned to an inactive API code/duty
        position (after an active flying assignment – PCA or PCS) will turn in their FEF to the
        HARM office within five duty days of assignment to an inactive API code/flying position
        (i.e. API-6 flyer is placed in an API-3 position, etc.). The HARM office will file the FEF
        inside the member"s FRF. If the member returns to active flying status, the HARM office
        will forward the FEF to the member"s flying unit.
     1.5.6. Turn in medical records to the Flight Medicine Element (FME) within 10 duty-days
     after arriving at new duty station and complete initial medical clearance requirements prior to
     first flight or jump.
        1.5.6.1. (Added) Initial medical clearance requirements also apply to members who
        deploy for 365 days or longer in TDY or PCS status.
     1.5.7. Complete a Preventive Health Assessment (PHA) annually not later than the last day
     of, but not earlier than five months prior to, the member‘s birth month.
     1.5.8. Members will sign out their AF Form 702,Individual Physiological Training
     Record(original), and AF Form 1042,Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special
     Operational Duty(copy) from the HARM office prior to attending physiological/centrifuge
     training. Upon completion of training, return forms to the HARM office within 5 duty days
     after arrival at home station.

     active flying billet in a unit without flying facilities or aircraft.
     1.5.11. When aircrew members depart PCS or PCA, ensure sign-out from unit/base does not
     negatively affect Operational Flying Duty Accumulation (OFDA) credit. Aircrew members p
     require at least 15 days on active flying status in a month to receive OFDA credit for that
     month. See Chapter 2, Paragraph 2.6, for additional guidance pertaining to operational
     flying duty.
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                         15


       1.5.11.1. Aircrew members assigned to an active flying billet who are being reassigned
       to an inactive billet should make every effort to outprocess from their unit/base after the
       15th of the month to provide an opportunity to obtain the last month of OFDA credit (if
       flight requirements are also met).
       1.5.11.2. Aircrew members assigned to an inactive billet who are being reassigned to an
       active billet should outprocess from their unit/base before the 15th of the month to
       provide an opportunity to obtain OFDA credit for the first month of assignment in an
       active billet (if flight requirements are also met).
1.6. Flying Obligations.

     passenger manifest, and must fly on commercial or military aircraft with adequate
     facilities for transporting passengers. Refer to Paragraphs 1.9.4.7 ,2.12.5, and applicable
     MDS-Specific guidance for further passenger guidance/restrictions.
     1.6.2.4. Commanders, including unit commanders, may detail by written orders
     personnel under their command to take part in aircraft flights operated by any foreign
     government accredited by the United States, provided the flights do not add additional
     expense to the US Government, and provided personnel are on AOs authorizing frequent
     and regular flights. See Paragraph 1.11 for additional guidance.
     1.6.2.5. Personnel not authorized AOs (as specified above) tasked to perform unique
     ground support duties at an enroute location or destination point that are directly related
     and essential to accomplishment of the aircraft or unit mission, e.g., a specialist or
     technician required to provide aircraft support or a security team required to guard the
     aircraft, may fly as Mission Essential Personnel (MEP). MAJCOMs may further define
     MEP in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction, but guidance may not be less
     restrictive than the guidance contained herein. See paragraph 1.12.2.2 for additional
     guidance, and Attachment 1, Terms, for MEP definition.
     1.6.2.5. (AETC) For detailed information regarding mission essential personnel (MEP),
     see paragraph A7.7 (Added).
        1.6.2.5.1. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational control of the mission being
        flown authorizes MEP status. If operational control transfers, the OG/CC (or
        equivalent) who assumes follow-on operational control may continue/revise MEP
        status (coordinate changes with originating OG/CC). MAJCOMs may establish intra-
        command and inter-command guidance to facilitate this process. MEP may only fly
        on aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R, Air
        Transportation Eligibility. EXCEPTIONS: (a) MEP who are mission essential to
        aircraft launch/recovery may fly on aircraft not normally equipped for carrying
        passengers. MEP who fly under the provisions of this exception must be physically
        and physiologically (when required) qualified and must complete applicable egress
        training prior to flight. (b) Under exceptional conditions (e.g. national emergency,
        severe weather, earthquake, flood) MEP may be flown on non-passenger carrying
        aircraft if their duties are essential to the maintenance of the aircraft at the recovery
        base. All steps should be taken to pre-deploy these personnel via other means of
        transportation, if adequate time permits.
     1.6.2.6. MAJCOMs may designate aircrew members who travel as additional
     crewmembers (not required for the mission being flown but required for follow-on
     missions) as MEP. Approval authority may be delegated below MAJCOM level.
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                     17


       1.6.2.6. (AETC) The OG/CC is delegated approval authority for aircrew members when
       required to fly in MEP status.
          1.6.2.6.1. For AMC missions already in the system, the TACC Senior Controller may
          approve MEP status. MAJCOM Standardization/Evaluation Chiefs may approve
          MEP status for MAJCOM or MAJCOM-gained missions for evaluators assigned to
          the MAJCOM. Additional crewmembers who fly in MEP status may only fly on
          aircraft capable of carrying passengers IAW provisions of DoD 4515.13-R.
1.7. Waivers.
   1.7.1. For Combat Missions or National Emergencies. MAJCOM commanders may waive
   any requirements of this instruction when necessary to carry out combat missions or to
   accomplish missions flown during a state of national emergency. Provide notification to
   AF/A3/5 with a copy to AF/A3O-AT.
   1.7.2. At Other Times. Unless otherwise specified in this instruction, AF/A3O-A is the
   waiver authority for this instruction. Request waivers through applicable channels to the
   MAJCOM/A3, or equivalent level. MAJCOM/A3s (or equivalents) will forward to AF/A3O-
   A, with a courtesy copy to AF/A3O-AT. Waivers to supplemental guidance will be handled
   by the MAJCOM agency that generated the supplement.
   1.7.3. Administrative Procedures. MAJCOMs may publish HQ USAF waivers in
   supplements citing the authority (e.g., HQ USAF/A3O memo, date, subject). See AFI 33-
   360, Publications and Forms Management, for additional guidance on waivers to

Section 1B—Flight Authorization

1.8. Aircraft Flight Authorizations.
   1.8.1. Prior to all flights in Air Force aircraft, commanders (including unit commanders)
   issue written authorizations documenting all personnel required to perform inflight duties on
   the mission. Units will use AF Form 4327, ARMS Fighter Flight Authorization, or AF Form
   4327a, Crew Flight Authorization, as applicable to the unit aircraft. A commander's
   (including unit commanders) verbal authorization may direct aircraft flight only when time
   constraints or administrative procedures prevent written authorization. Written confirmation
   of this order must be issued within three duty-days. Once a Flight Authorization (FA) has
   been signed, changes to aircrew names and/or duty positions must be validated by a
   designated approving authority by placing the approving authority's initials by the line
   changed. The OG/CC or equivalent commander with operational control of the mission is
   responsible for the publication/ maintenance/retention of the aircraft FAs for each mission
   flown by the aircraft. Only commissioned officers and officer equivalent government
   civilians in active flying positions are authorized to be authenticating officials for Flight
   Authorizations. FA authenticating officials will be appointed in writing by the OG/CC or
   equivalent commander. EXCEPTION 1: Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), Pararescue (PJ), and
   ANG Senior Scout unit commanders and properly designated authenticating officials may
   publish a FA for assigned aircrew members required to perform aircrew duties on the
   mission. Commanders or designated authenticating officials must ensure all members listed
   meet go-no-go criteria prior to authenticating the FA. The FA is not a stand-alone document
18                                         AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


     and must be attached to the aircraft FA for the mission on which aircrew members were
     required to perform in-flight duties. If the AE or PJ crew is scheduled to perform aircrew
     duties on more than one mission, a remark will be placed on the FA to depict variations. As a
     minimum, the information in blocks 11 through 18 must be documented on the flight
     authorization. In the Remarks section of the aircraft FA, annotate the AE/pararescue FA
     number, date, and unit designation. The FA is a critical document used to validate aircrew
     member‘s duties/flight time logged on the AFTO Form 781. Officers or officer equivalent
     government civilians will be designated as FA authenticating officials in writing by the
     OG/CC or equivalent commander. Members properly designated as FA authenticating
     officials IAW this paragraph are not required to be assigned to an active flying position to
     perform FA authentication duties. EXCEPTION 2: UAS units will complete a preflight
     authorization signed by the aircraft commander to confirm go-no-go checks were completed.
     The authenticating official will issue a verbal order for the mission. The FA will be published
     upon termination of the mission and include crew members who flew on the mission, verbal
     order acknowledged in the remark section, and AC block initialed by the duty scheduler.
        1.8.1.1. Units will validate go-no-go qualification IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2,Aircrew
        Standardization/Evaluation Program, prior to authorizing members to participate in
        aircrew or operational support duties. Once a FA has been published, the pilot in
        command, or FA authenticating official if the pilot in command is not available, will
        validate go-no-go status for additional aircrew or operational support members prior to
        authorizing them to fly and adding or attaching them to the FA. Validation may include
        ARMS products IAW AFI 11-421 (or comparable database for USAFA airmanship
        programs), a FA from an AE, Pararescue, or Senior Scout unit commander (or designated
        representative), or a letter from the member‘s unit validating the individual"s
        qualification to fly on required missions. Note: When preparing flight authorizations for
        missions scheduled on future dates, the aviation resource management specialist or
        designated representative responsible for go-no-go validation will confirm the members‘
        aeronautical order status and ensure currency (to include flight physical and physiological
        training) and qualification will remain valid through the scheduled flight date(s). The FA
        is an official document depicting what actually occurred on the mission. The original,
        printed, signed forms with changes annotated are required documentation. Reproduction
        and disposal of the original forms to remove pen/ink changes after the flight
        authenticating official has signed the form and sorties/missions have occurred is not
        authorized.
     1.8.2. The flight authorization must include (minimum requirements):
        1.8.2.1. A designated pilot-in-command, and formation flight leader of each flight or
        flight element.
        1.8.2.1. (AETC) Place an asterisk by the name of the designated flight or mission lead
        in a formation. Place a double asterisk by the alternate flight or mission lead.
        1.8.2.2. Name, grade, and flight authorization duty code (Table A2.3) of each
        crewmember, operational support flier, or any other official personnel (use the position
        designation established by the MAJCOM) required for the mission or flight.
        1.8.2.3. Type, serial number, mission symbol, and call sign of aircraft or formation.
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                        19


      1.8.2.4. Place from which the flight will depart plus "on-or-about" departure date.
      1.8.2.5. An itinerary and the phrase "Variations in itinerary authorized."
      1.8.2.6. Provisions of AFI 65-103,Temporary Duty Orders, apply to temporary duty
      performed incidental to authorized flights. Include a statement to this effect on the flight
      authorization.
      1.8.2.7. (Added-AETC) Monitors and managers of the Equivalent Training
      Management System (ETMS), Combat Training Management System (CTMS), Time-
      Related Instruction Management (TRIM) product, Computer-Aided Aircrew Scheduling
      System (CAASS), Tactical Aircrew Scheduling and Airspace Management System
      (TASAMS), Patriot Excalibur (PEX), Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS),
      Training Integration Management System (TIMS), or Graduate TIMS (GTIMS) must
      ensure flight authorizations produced by their systems comply with paragraph 1.8 of the
      basic instruction.
   1.8.3. Flight authorizations will only include personnel on AOs (or contract aircrew
   personnel on a memorandum of agreement/contract) authorized to perform in-flight duties
   for that mission according to paragraphs 1.10 and 3.3 of this instruction. Except for MEP
   and non-interference members, individuals on the flight authorization should match those
   authorized to log time on the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract.
      1.8.3.1. Personnel who are on the aircraft for point-to-point travel, an
      orientation/familiarization flight or to only perform a proficiency jump (not performing
      aircrew duties for that mission) will be listed on the passenger manifest. Passenger
      manifesting is required on all DoD owned and controlled aircraft, IAW DoD 4500.9-
      R,Defense Transportation Regulation, Part 1.
      1.8.3.2. If MEP are transported, IAW MAJCOM supplements, they may be listed on the
      flight authorization in the Remarks section only. If MEP are listed on the flight
      authorization, the Remarks section will include all information required by DD Form
      2131, Passenger Manifest, to include emergency contact information. If MEP are not
      listed on the flight authorization, they must be placed on the passenger manifest. MEP
      will not be listed on the AFTO Form 781, will not log time, and will not accrue OFDA
      credit.
   1.8.4. If a mission is cancelled after the FA is signed, line through the canceled portion(s) of
   the flight authorization and annotate the reason for cancellation (e.g. weather or maintenance
   cancel).
   1.8.5. MAJCOMs will establish procedures to ensure compliance with the guidance in this
   section for alert sorties.
1.9. Authorization for Using US Air Force Aircraft.
   1.9.1. Commanders (including unit commanders) authorize aircraft flights to support
   command operations.
   1.9.2. Commanders (including unit commanders) will ensure each flight is in the direct

     1.9.3. The transportation of passengers and cargo will be in accordance with DoD 4515.13-
     R. The Deputy Chief of Staff/ Logistics, Installations and Mission Support, Logistics
     Readiness, Headquarters U.S. Air Force (HQ USAF/A4R), develops and publishes passenger
     policy to oversee passenger movement. AFI 24-101,Passenger Movement, provides guidance
     and procedures for arranging official transportation of Air Force personnel. Orientation
     flights may be approved as provided in DoD 4515.13-R and this instruction.
     1.9.3. (AETC) United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is the primary
     source for passenger or cargo airlift requests. In AETC, passenger and cargo airlift request
     requirements include paragraphs 1.9.3.1 (Added) through 1.9.3.3.5 (Added). Note: Not
     applicable to CAP-USAF.
        1.9.3.1. (Added-AETC) Airlift Restrictions. See DoDD 4500.56, DoD Policy on the
        Use of Government Aircraft and Air Travel; DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation
        Eligibility; DoD 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation Part 1–Passenger
        Movement; and the basic instruction.
        1.9.3.2. (Added-AETC) Airlift Mission Types:
            1.9.3.2.1. (Added-AETC) AETC Airlift Support Missions. An AETC airlift
            support mission is established to meet a military unit‘s request for support of
            passenger or cargo-carrying requirements for inspections, conferences, deployments,
            exercises, competitions, performances, demonstrations, or aerial events on a
            passenger carrying capable aircraft. According to DoD 4515.13-R, two-seat trainer
            aircraft are not considered passenger-carrying aircraft. This does not restrict their use
            for orientation flights (see Table A8.1 (Added)).
                1.9.3.2.1.1. (Added-AETC) Unit Exercise Support. Units with passenger-
                carrying aircraft may fly unit-assigned personnel as space-required passengers
                within the home station and auxiliary airfield area in support of local unit mobility
                training exercises. The OG/CC is the approval authority for unit-assigned
                personnel space-required passenger status. The WG/CC is the approval authority
                for the mission and non-unit-assigned personnel. The mission profile and aircraft
                maneuvers are restricted by the basic instruction, this supplement, and MDS-
                specific passenger guidance.
                1.9.3.2.1.2. (Added-AETC) Space Available/Required (A/R) Travel. See
                DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 6, and AFI 24-101, Passenger Movement, and its AETC
                supplement. Space A travel is authorized on passenger-carrying aircraft at the unit
                CC‘s discretion. Units will not schedule aircraft specifically to transport space
                A/R passengers unless dedicated airlift approval is requested in accordance with
                paragraph 1.9.3.3 (Added). Note: DoD 4515.13-R paragraph C1.3.6 and DoDD
                4500.56, paragraph 4J, aircraft not designed or normally configured for passenger
                (non-aircrew personnel) carrying capability, such as, but not limited to, fighter
                aircraft, are not to be used for passenger travel. This restriction includes all AETC
                T-1 trainer aircraft.
                1.9.3.2.1.3. (Added-AETC) Airlift Missions (Staff Ride and Professional
                Development Dedicated):
                   1.9.3.2.1.3.1. (Added-AETC) Staff ride participants literally walk the battle
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                      21


               ground and figuratively dissect commander battle decisions. Normal venues
               include U.S. Civil War and Revolutionary War battlefields, and areas outside
               the continental U.S. (OCONUS) where battles resulted in significant or high
               impact leadership decisions. In contrast, professional development
               opportunities are visits to military or civilian seats of importance such as the
               U.S. Air Force Museum, U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), U.S. Congress,
               U.S. Supreme Court, and Library of Congress. Ground transportation is the
               preferred method of travel for both types of visits.
               1.9.3.2.1.3.2. (Added-AETC) These opportunities are available to all AETC
               wings. Staff ride or professional development opportunities that require
               dedicated AETC airlift are limited to two per year for all wings. Follow
               aircraft request procedures in paragraphs 1.9.3.3 (Added) through 1.9.3.3.5
               (Added). The NAF/DOO will coordinate air transportation and notify wings
               of the approved asset.
               1.9.3.2.1.3.3. (Added-AETC) Dedicated airlift missions will be authorized
               only if all of these apply: (1) They are supplied by AETC–owned assets; (2)
               There is no impact on programmed flying training (PFT); (3) No additional
               resources are provided; (4) Travelers are on official, funded temporary duty
               (TDY) orders; and (5) There is no perception of fraud, waste, or abuse of
               military assets. Since these are AETC-owned assets, requestors do not need to
               submit the electronic staff summary sheet (ESSS) airlift request to
               USTRANSCOM. At minimum, the ESSS must include required dates, pick-
               up locations, drop-off locations, number of passengers, class of passengers
               (military, civilian, distinguished visitor [DV], etc.), type of cargo/equipment
               to be carried, weight (in pounds) of cargo/equipment, justification for flight,
               and a statement that all travelers are on official, funded TDY orders, and all
               cargo, if applicable, is authorized for transport according to DoD 4515.13-R.
        1.9.3.2.2. (Added-AETC) USTRANSCOM Missions. Airlift mission types
        include funded and unfunded passenger and cargo-carrying missions approved by
        USTRANSCOM for Air Force airlift support.
     1.9.3.3. (Added-AETC) Airlift Request Procedures:
        1.9.3.3.1. (Added-AETC) Units must submit all ESSS requests for AETC airlift
        support to NAF/DOO at least 14 days prior to the requested airlift date. At minimum,
        the ESSS must include: required dates, pick-up locations, drop-off locations, number
        of passengers, class of passengers (military, civilian, DV, etc.), type of
        cargo/equipment to be carried, weight (in pounds) of cargo equipment, justification
        for flight, and a statement that all travelers are on official, funded TDY orders and all
        cargo, if applicable, is authorized for transport, according to DoD 4515.13R.
           1.9.3.3.1.1. (Added-AETC) Non-AETC units may request airlift support from
           AETC only after making the request through their commands to USTRANSCOM,
           and being placed on the unfunded requirements list. Annotate USTRANSCOM
           nonsupport in the ESSS justification to reflect that USTRANSCOM is unable to
           support the request.
22                                       AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


               1.9.3.3.1.2. (Added-AETC) AETC units will request airlift support through
               AETC and USTRANSCOM channels simultaneously. The requester must submit
               DD Form 2768, Military Air Passenger/Cargo Request, to the HQ AETC/A4RTT
               for submission to USTRANSCOM. Include a statement in the remarks block of
               the DD Form 2768 that an ESSS request has been submitted to the NAF/DOO,
               and a statement in the ESSS that the DD Form 2768 was submitted to HQ
               AETC/A4RTT. Units must submit both requests at least 14 days prior to the
               event. The NAF/CC is the waiver authority for requests to USTRANSCOM.
           1.9.3.3.2. (Added-AETC) The NAF/DOO forwards the ESSS airlift request for
           NAF/CC approval or disapproval. NAF/CC approval does not guarantee AETC
           support. Unless tasked by higher headquarters (HHQ), AETC WG/CCs decide
           whether or not to support an approved airlift mission.
           1.9.3.3.3. (Added-AETC) HQ      AETC/A4RTT        notifies      NAF/DOO       when
           USTRANSCOM approves or disapproves a request. The NAF/DOO notifies the
           requesting unit, and if USTRANSCOM support is approved. If the NAF/CC also
           approves the request, NAF/DOO instructs the AETC airlift unit to maintain backup or
           standby status in case USTRANSCOM cancels its support.
           1.9.3.3.4. (Added-AETC) Five days prior to the mission request date, HQ
           AETC/A4RTT notifies the NAF/DOO of the USTRANSCOM support or nonsupport
           status. If USTRANSCOM does not support the request, but AETC support is
           approved, the NAF/DOO notifies NAF/CC. The NAF/CC decides whether to cancel
           the USTRANSCOM request in order to use AETC airlift support, and advises HQ
           AETC/A4RTT to cancel the USTRANSCOM airlift support request, if necessary.
           1.9.3.3.5. (Added-AETC) The NAF/CC is the approval authority for
           USTRANSCOM mission requests to use wing assets. Units will inform NAF/DO no
           later than 14 days prior to mission execution.
        1.9.3.4. (Added-AETC) Ferry Flights. Ferry flight missions are:
           1.9.3.4.1. (Added-AETC) Added to the daily schedule, at short notice, for
           unscheduled events in support of unit operational requirements.
           1.9.3.4.2. (Added-AETC) Accomplished with authorities, procedures, and
           restrictions described in DoDD 4500.56, Enclosure 2 (E2); DoD 4515.13-R, Chapters
           1, 2, and 7; AETCI 21-104, Aircraft Planning and Scheduling Procedures; and this
           supplement.
           1.9.3.4.3. (Added-AETC) Used to transport MEP, aircraft parts, or equipment to
           inoperative aircraft at off-station locations, according to current DoD and Air Force
           directives and procedures outlined in paragraphs 1.6.2.5, 1.6.2.6, and 1.12.2 of the
           basic instruction, and paragraph A7.7 (Added).
           1.9.3.4.4. (Added-AETC) Added to the daily schedule of an existing sortie that has
           the approval of the OG/CC, the SQ/CC, or operations officer.
     1.9.4. Commanders (including unit commanders) may use Air Force aircraft under their
     control to:
        1.9.4.1. Perform tactical and combat operations.

     4515.13-R).
     1.9.4.4. (AETC) Except for Air Mobility Command (AMC) Tanker Airlift Control
     Center (TACC)-tasked missions, the local command post or operations control center is
     the central point of contact (POC) for handling and coordinating civilian medical
     transportation requests.
     1.9.4.5. Cooperate with foreign governments as directed by HQ USAF.
     1.9.4.6. Perform other official missions as required.
        1.9.4.6.1. (Added-AETC) Refer all search and rescue (SAR) requests to the local
        command post. Aircrews from the 58th Special Operations Wing (SOW) and 336
        TRG are authorized to perform SAR and disaster relief missions that have been
        coordinated through and approved by the rescue coordination center. They are
        authorized to conduct real-time SAR if life and limb are at risk.
        1.9.4.6.2. (Added-AETC) For information regarding the instructor enrichment
        program (IEP), see paragraph A7.2 (Added).
     1.9.4.7. Conduct the Air Force Orientation Flight and Public Affairs Travel Programs
     according to DoD 4515.13-R; AFI 11-301, Aircrew Life Support (ALS) Program; AFI 11-

     Medical Examinations and Standards, Volume 3, Flying and Special Operational Duty;
     this instruction, and MAJCOM guidelines.
     1.9.4.7. (AETC) For AETC-specific information, see Table 1.1 in the basic instruction,
     and paragraphs 1.9.4.7.1.6 (Added) through 1.9.4.7.1.6.8.10 (Added). Approval authority
     will not be further delegated.
        1.9.4.7.1. Orientation Flights. The USAF conducts orientation flights to reward and
        motivate individuals (incentive orientation flights only), ensure a better understanding
        of a particular weapon system and its role, or when the flight is determined to be in
        the best interest of the USAF. Table 1.1is a matrix of approval authorities for
        orientation flights.
            1.9.4.7.1.1. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Flights. Display USAF weapons systems
            to individuals so they gain a better understanding of the particular aircraft and

     orientation flights, see paragraph A7.4 (Added).
     1.9.4.7.1.3. Incentive Flights. Provide a visible reward to military personnel for
     outstanding service and motivate others to similar performance levels.
     1.9.4.7.1.3. (AETC) For further information regarding incentive orientation
     flights, see paragraph A7.5 (Added).
     1.9.4.7.1.4. Spouse Orientation Flights. Familiarize military spouses with the unit
     aircraft and mission to enhance their understanding of the military member‘s role
     and contribution to the Air Force mission. Spouse orientation flights will be
     limited to retention and recruitment of critical skills and will not be expanded to
     an all-skills, service-wide program. Spouse orientation flights will adhere to the
     following guidance:
     1.9.4.7.1.4. (AETC) For detailed information regarding the Spouse Flight and
     Taxi Orientation (SFTO) Program, see paragraph A7.12 (Added).
        1.9.4.7.1.4.1. Provide flights within approved flying hour programs.
        1.9.4.7.1.4.2. Do not use aircraft requiring routine oxygen breathing
        equipment, or equipped with ejection seats, or have automatic escape devices
        requiring special training.
        1.9.4.7.1.4.3. Do not accomplish simulated emergency procedures, unusual
        attitudes, touch-and-go landings, minimum altitude, terrain following profiles,
        airdrop missions, and other maneuvers/profiles listed in MDS-specific
        publications as prohibited with passengers on board.
        1.9.4.7.1.4.4. Ensure a qualified pilot or copilot occupies the seat throughout
        the flight. Under no circumstances will a spouse be given control of the
        aircraft. The pilot in command will brief this restriction prior to each mission.
        1.9.4.7.1.4.5. Units with fighter, bomber, and two-seat trainer aircraft may
        establish an aircraft spouse taxi-ride program.
     1.9.4.7.1.5. Passengers on orientation flights must be in appropriate
     organizational uniform, where applicable, and present appropriate identification.
     1.9.4.7.1.6. (Added-AETC) AETC Orientation Flight Guidelines:
        1.9.4.7.1.6.1. (Added-AETC) The mission profile and aircraft maneuvers
        are restricted by the basic instruction, this supplement, and MDS-specific
        guidance for carrying passengers. Therefore, report these individuals
        according to guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 3_AETCSUP.
        1.9.4.7.1.6.2. (Added-AETC) Normally, individuals are approved for only
        one orientation flight per assignment. Repeat flyers require additional
        approval from the commander who approved the initial orientation flight.
        Units must justify the multiple flights on the request. Exception: Wing
        commanders at undergraduate flying training (UFT) bases may authorize
        more than one flight for graduate students selected to remain as first
        assignment instructor pilots. Follow IEP guidance for egress and aircrew
        flight equipment (AFE) training. Graduates selected to be T-6 instructors may

             fly during critical phases of flight with a 19 AF/DO waiver. Note: The AETC
             Form 327 may be used for unit documentation but is not required at higher
             headquarters (HHQ).
             1.9.4.7.1.6.3. (Added-AETC) AETC commanders at all levels may
             nominate individuals for orientation flights. (Note: Nominated individuals
             must be volunteers.) The AETC Form 327 may be used for unit
             documentation but is not required at HHQ. Send requests to the OG/CC at the
             unit that controls the requested aircraft. The OG/CC determines what type of
             orientation flight or profile is appropriate for the individual and who the
             approval authority will be (see Table 1.1. of the basic instruction and this
             supplement for further guidance). Approval requirements include:
              1.9.4.7.1.6.3.1. (Added-AETC) DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 4, defines the
              categories of passengers eligible for orientation flights.
              1.9.4.7.1.6.3.2. (Added-AETC) All orientation flight requests that require
              approval above the WG/CC, according to Table 1.1 must be received at
              NAF DOO:
              1.9.4.7.1.6.3.2.1. (Added-AETC) For NAF/CC approval, no later than 14
              days prior to the flight.
              1.9.4.7.1.6.3.2.2. (Added-AETC) For AETC/CC approval, no later than 21
              days prior to the flight.
              1.9.4.7.1.6.3.2.3. (Added-AETC) For HQ USAF or higher approval, no
              later than 30 days prior to the flight. Note: The AETC Form 327 may be
              used for unit documentation but is not required at HHQ.
             1.9.4.7.1.6.4. (Added-AETC) Requests for orientation flights that come
             directly to an AETC flight, squadron, group, or wing from non-AETC
             headquarters agencies will be immediately forwarded up the appropriate chain
             of command to the appropriate approval authority. These requests must
             include recommendations for support or nonsupport.
             1.9.4.7.1.6.5. (Added-AETC) The SQ/CC or equivalent selects only highly
             qualified instructors or mission qualified crewmembers to conduct orientation
             flights.
             1.9.4.7.1.6.6. (Added-AETC) Unless otherwise provided in MDS-specific
             guidance (technical orders (TO), AFIs, etc.), use the orientation flight and
             generalized passenger briefing guide provided in Attachment 9 (Added) to
             brief orientation flyers and passengers prior to flight. The aircraft commander
             is responsible for ensuring all passengers are briefed.
             1.9.4.7.1.6.7. (Added-AETC) AETC Form 30, Orientation Flight
             Certificate, may be presented to participants following orientation flights.
             1.9.4.7.1.6.8. (Added-AETC) The restrictions to consider and observe
             during orientation flights include:
              1.9.4.7.1.6.8.1. (Added-AETC) Orientation flights are normally flown
26                        AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


     within the local home station or auxiliary flying area. However, the WG/CC,
     after careful consideration of planning and safety factors, may allow off
     home station orientation flights after ensuring compliance with Table 1.1 of
     the basic instruction, and DoD 4515.13-R. Wings must include procedures
     for off home station orientation flights in local operating procedures. Wings
     will publish local instructions or supplements according to guidance in AFI
     33-360, Publications and Forms Management, and provide procedures,
     briefings, and checklists that comply with the guidelines contained in
     Attachment 9 (Added). Wings will forward these publications to the
     NAF/DO for approval prior to publication. Off home station orientation
     flights are prohibited unless units have approved written procedures. Note:
     Point-to-point orientation flights are not permitted according to DoD policy
     and the basic instruction.
     1.9.4.7.1.6.8.2. (Added-AETC) Orientation sortie approval is valid for 6
     months or until accomplished, whichever comes first. (Note: The AETC
     Form 327 may be used for unit documentation but is not required at HHQ.)
     AFE and ejection-seat training is valid for a 72-hour period and must be
     reaccomplished after the period expires, according to AFI 11-301, Volume
     1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Program, and the AETC supplement.
     Exception: For aircrew members awaiting introduction to fighter
     fundamentals (IFF), upgrade instructor pilot/weapon systems officer
     (UIP/UIW), or follow-on fighter training, emergency escape (EE) and
     parachute descent training (PDT) will remain valid until 90 days following
     EE and PDT training or the subsequent course start date, whichever comes
     first. Ejection seat orientation flight candidates will report to the flight
     surgeon for medical review according to guidance in AFI 48-123, Medical
     Examinations and Standards. Orientation flight passengers under 18 years
     of age require written parental approval before the flight, according to DoD
     4515.13-R, paragraph C4.1.
     1.9.4.7.1.6.8.3. (Added-AETC) Touch-and-go landings will not be
     performed on any orientation flights or sorties. The WG/CC may further
     restrict the mission or sortie profile, as necessary, for passenger safety.
     1.9.4.7.1.6.8.4. (Added-AETC) Active duty and Air Reserve component
     (ARC) personnel will not fly on orientation flights while in leave status.
     1.9.4.7.1.6.8.5. (Added-AETC) The pilot in command will occupy the
     front or left seat (waiver authority is NAF/CC). If the orientation recipient is
     at a set of controls, no other passengers are permitted on board (Note: Not
     applicable to CAP-USAF).
     1.9.4.7.1.6.8.5.1. (Added-AETC) Authorized civilian participants who are
     outside the aircraft TO seat design limit (SDL) are restricted to aircraft in
     which they meet the SDL or to non-ejection seat aircraft. Commanders at all
     levels must make every effort, prior to offering a flight, to obtain candidate
     weights and make appropriate aircraft recommendations. Note: An
     exception to policy waiver may be requested for a civilian nominee outside
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                 27


              SDL weight restrictions, but still within weight-for-flight limits. These
              waivers are rarely granted, and only if no other aircraft is available and the
              benefits to the Air Force outweigh the risk of potential liability. Such a
              request requires the nominees to sign a hold harmless agreement. When a
              hold harmless agreement is required, forward a signed copy of the
              agreement with the ESSS for flight authorization. Individuals must read and
              understand AETC Form 35, Ejection Seat Weight Limit Notification.
              Ejection seat weight waiver approval authority is the NAF/CC.
              1.9.4.7.1.6.8.5.2. (Added-AETC) Personnel scheduled for an orientation
              flight in ejection seat aircraft must:
              1.9.4.7.1.6.8.5.2.1. (Added-AETC) Demonstrate, while wearing AFE, a
              working knowledge of every switch on the oxygen regulator; ―gang
              loading‖ the regulator (EMER, O2-100 percent, green mode level-ON); the
              emergency oxygen supply system (green apple/ring), without activation;
              dropping the mask from the helmet using the bayonet release; disconnecting
              the oxygen supply hose from the CRU-60/P or CRU 94/P; disconnecting the
              mask hose from the side of the CRU-60/P or CRU-94/P; and breaking the
              seal on the mask by sticking a finger anywhere inside the edge of the mask,
              grabbing the hose on the front of the mask and pulling upward, and tucking
              the chin down to the chest.
              1.9.4.7.1.6.8.5.2.2. (Added-AETC)         Be aware of these operating
              characteristics of some oxygen regulators: green mode lever can be
              intentionally or inadvertently bumped from ON to OFF; green mode lever
              might stick in a position between ON and OFF; some regulators may allow
              you to breathe with green mode lever off; and oxygen may be supplied with
              the green mode lever slightly out of OFF.
              1.9.4.7.1.6.8.6. (Added-AETC) For orientation flights in ejection-seat
              aircraft, participants must be 18 or older (age waivers will not be granted).
              Authorized participants outside the aircraft TO SDL are restricted to aircraft
              in which they meet the SDL or to non-ejection seat aircraft. All individuals,
              regardless of weight, must read and understand AETC Form 35.
              1.9.4.7.1.6.8.7. (Added-AETC) Pregnant women will not fly in ejection-
              seat aircraft. However, with clearance from the flight surgeon, they may fly
              in non-ejection seat aircraft.
              1.9.4.7.1.6.8.8. (Added-AETC) Each ejection seat aircraft orientation
              flight recipient will receive physiological training for the intended aircraft
              flight profile, according to AFI 11-403, Aerospace Physiological Training
              Program.
              1.9.4.7.1.6.8.9. (Added-AETC) USAFA and AFROTC cadets and active
              duty military members may accept control of the aircraft under instructor
              pilot (IP) direct supervision. The IP must be at the other set of controls.
              Such control is allowed only during noncritical phases of the flight. The
              NAF/CC has waiver authority. Critical phases include takeoffs and landings,
28                                         AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


                      radar and traffic patterns, air refueling, airdrops, and low levels. Critical
                      phases may be further restricted by MDS-specific or unit guidance.
                      1.9.4.7.1.6.8.10. (Added-AETC) According to Secretary of Defense
                      restrictions, at no time will civilian passengers touch or operate any type of
                      aircraft controls, including such on-board systems as the flight control stick,
                      air refueling booms, etc.
             1.9.4.7.2. Public Affairs Flights. The Air Force conducts public affairs flights for
             prominent US citizens, civic leaders, news media representatives, etc. See AFI 35-
             101 for guidance, to include approval authorities for public affairs flights.
             1.9.4.7.3. MAJCOMs, ANG, FOAs, and DRUs will administer orientation and public
             affairs flight programs according to the above guidelines. Secretary of Defense
             moratorium, ―Civilian Visitors Operating Military Equipment‖ (22 Feb 01), and
             CSAF memorandum, ―Air Force Policy on Civilian Visitors Operating Military
             Equipment‖ (20 Jul 01), apply (source documents on file in HQ USAF/A3O-AT). For
             approval authorities in Table 1.1, ANG will use equivalent positions, as appropriate.
                1.9.4.7.3.1. Maintain appropriate documentation          on   activity levels     and
                periodically evaluate program effectiveness.
                1.9.4.7.3.2. Units requesting orientation flight support from other MAJCOMs
                will submit a request through their owning MAJCOM/A3 to the supporting
                MAJCOM/A3 for staffing and approval.

NOTES:
1. ―Orientation flights‖ are defined as continuous flights performed within the local flying area
and terminating at the point of origin (DoD 4515.13-R, Chapter 4). ―Note 1 N/A,‖ means the
category of flight is not considered an orientation flight; however, it is included in the table as a
consolidated reference source.
2. Requests for point-to-point travel must be specifically addressed and approved by SECAF.
Retiring members of Congress and retiring congressional staff members may be flown on
orientation flights only upon the written approval of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Legislative Affairs (ASD[LA]). (Ref. DSD Memo, 23 Dec 1996.)
3. When aircraft are ―chopped‖ or assigned to a gaining Combatant Commander, approval
authority will be the Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) or Theater Special Operations
Command (SOC) commander.
4. Inform AF/CC, AF/A3/5, AF/A3O, AF/A3O-A, if approved.
5. Flights involving foreign nationals must be reviewed for foreign disclosure requirements and
political concerns. Foreign government officials are equivalent to U.S. Federal government
officials and do not include local government officials such as mayors, police chiefs, and other
local officials who do not represent a foreign government at the national level. Foreign military
"civilian equivalents" are comparable to DoD "civilian equivalents ."
a. Ensure foreign disclosure requirements and base visit requests are satisfied according to AFI
16-201, Air Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program.
b. Coordinate with the country director in the appropriate SAF/IA regional division (four-letter
level), before approval, to ensure no political concerns exist that would prevent the flight.

 Notes:
 16. (Added) Prior to the flight, WG/CCs will notify the NAF/DOO of WG/CC-approved
 orientation flights for active duty general and flag officers, active duty personnel of any service
 who hold the position of wing commander or equivalent, GM-15s and above, chief master
 sergeants of the Air Force, MAJCOM command chief master sergeants (CCM), and Medal of
 Honor recipients. To ensure timely notification, submit via fax or E-mail. The AETC Form
 327, Air Education and Training Command Orientation Flight Request may be used for unit
 documentation but is not required at HHQ.
 17. (Added) HQ AETC/A2/3/10 approval is required for orientation flights of the sons and
 daughters (who are otherwise eligible for orientation flights according to the basic instruction
 or other DoD directives) of senior officers on aircraft assigned to their parents‘ wing or group.
 In this context, senior officer refers to NAF/CCs and vice commanders (CV), WG/CCs and
 CVs, and group commanders and deputy group commanders.
 18. (Added) This category applies to USAFA and AFROTC cadets only. Use an ESSS for
 orientation flights for USAFA and AFROTC cadets who are not on official deployment orders
 or part of a formal training unit (FTU). When these cadets fly using ESSS authorization,
 manifest them according to guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules, and the
 AETC supplement. The cadets must meet the requirements and restrictions of an orientation
 flight. The AETC Form 327 may be used for unit documentation but is not required at HHQ.
 19. (Added) Due to ejection-seat weight limitations, these individuals will fly in nonejection-
 seat aircraft only.

     rating or aviation badge, are on active AOs to take part in frequent and regular flights,
     and are within the authorized crew complement (AFI 65-503) for the aircraft or required
     for the mission. Unless ordered to perform mission-essential rated duties outside their
     normal aircrew specialty in direct support of MAJCOM (or equivalent) -approved
     operations, aircrew members will perform duty associated with their current aeronautical
     rating and aircrew qualification. Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for incentive
     pay or OFDA credit is not authorized.
         1.10.1.1.1. (Added) When members are ordered to perform rated duties outside their
         current aeronautical rating and aircrew qualification, and in direct support of
         Combatant Command operations, commanders will ensure members are trained and
         qualified via AF Form 8 or AF Form 8a to perform other rated duties. Commanders
         will provide a memorandum to the member‘s servicing HARM office with full
         justification for the action. HARM personnel will file this memorandum permanently
         in the member's FRF and change the member's crew position to "Y" in ARMS (see
         also Table A2.3). See AFI 11-421 for specific HARM actions.
     1.10.1.2. Qualified non-rated officers and enlisted personnel of US military services on
     AOs, are required to perform mission essential inflight duties on a full time basis, and are
     within the authorized crew complement (AFI 65-503) for the aircraft or required for the
     mission. Aircrew members will perform duty associated with their current aircrew
     specialty and aircrew qualification. Flying solely for the purpose of qualifying for
     incentive pay or OFDA credit is not authorized.
     1.10.1.3. Operational support fliers on AOs and required to perform specific inflight
     duties on an occasional basis that cannot be accomplished by regularly assigned crew
     members, and other non-rated members on non-interference AOs ( Paragraphs
     2.12.3and 2.12.4) who fly occasionally to perform specific official inflight tasks. Flying
     solely for the purpose of qualifying for Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay is not authorized.
     1.10.1.4. Personnel authorized by competent authority to receive instruction in aircrew
     duties at Air Force schools.
     1.10.1.5. Professionally qualified civilian employees of the US Government. MAJCOM
     commanders determine individual qualifications.

     Training Corps (ROTC) cadets, Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences
     (USUHS) and Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) students participating in
     aviation related activities, and Civil Air Patrol (CAP) cadets are authorized to participate
     in flying duties as observers, in a special training status, on missions as determined by the
     MAJCOM. HARM offices will publish AOs for such cadets or students. Neither flying
     incentive pay nor flying duty credit is authorized, nor will aviation service dates be
     established.
     1.10.1.8. (AETC) The HARM office will publish AF IMT 1887, Aeronautical Order
     (PA) Aviation Service, for USAFA cadets; AFROTC cadets; Uniformed Services
     University of Health Sciences (USUHS) and Health Professionals Scholarship Program
     (HPSP) students participating in aviation-related activities; and CAP cadets. However,
     the office will not enter them into the Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS).
     (Note: Do not log time in ARMS or on AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight
     Data. For guidance on completing the AFTO Form 781, see AFTO 00-20-1, Aerospace
     Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures.) The
     306th Operations Support Squadron (OSS) HARM must ensure an AF IMT 1887 is
     published for USAFA cadets prior to their departure for summer camp. USAFA and
     AFROTC flights will be provided, according to this supplement. See Table 1.1, Note 18
     (Added) and paragraph A7.11.2 (Added). USUHS and HPSP students, and CAP cadets
     will fly on orientation flights, according to the basic instruction and this supplement.
     1.10.1.9. Cadets assigned to the US Air Force Academy and Air Force ROTC cadets
     enrolled in approved USAFA flying programs are accorded aircrew status while actively
     participating in such programs. Cadets will be placed on an AF Form 1887,Aeronautical
     Order, authorizing flying status while participating in approved USAFA flying programs.
     Cadets will not be entered into an operational ARMS database, an Aviation Service Code
     (ASC) will not be assigned, and an Aviation Service Date (ASD) will not be established.
     Neither flying incentive pay nor OFDA credit is authorized.
     1.10.1.10. (Added-AETC) Aircrew members from other commands may instruct AETC
     student training missions only if they are certified formal training unit (FTU) instructors
     or part of a MAJCOM/A3-to-MAJCOM/A3 agreement. Forward by-name requests for
     other than FTU-certified instructors for approval through AETC/A3T. For attached flying
     requests, refer to paragraph 2.20 of the basic instruction and paragraphs 2.20 through
     2.20.3 (Added) of this supplement. Exception: ARC instructors, utilized under the HQ
     AETC/A2/3/10 manpower authorization (MPA) man-day program, who complete local
     area orientation and FTU instructor training are considered 314th FTU instructors for the
     duration of their commitment to the 314th and, therefore, require only an interfly
     arrangement, according to AFI 11-2C-130, Volume 3, C-130 Operations Procedure. The
     intent of the program is to require ARC instructors who become FTU instructors to
     remain in place for at least 90 days to ensure PFT-producing productivity.
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                       35


       1.10.1.11. (Added-AETC) AETC aircrews with an assignment or course enrollment to
       another MDS aircraft will not fly outside the prescribed syllabus once they start any
       portion of a flying training program (including academics and simulator training) for the
       newly assigned MDS aircraft. After completing training in the new aircraft, crewmember
       will not fly in a primary duty position in previously assigned MDS aircraft Exception:
       Training accomplished to provide the member with multiple aircraft qualification,
       according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training.
       1.10.1.12. (Added-AETC) The HARM office will establish procedures to ensure
       aircrew members have completed an initial medical clearance, according to AFI 48-123,
       before performing duties in an Air Force aircraft.
   1.10.2. Family members will not be assigned to airborne duty on the same aircraft for a
   given mission. Family member is defined as spouse, brother, sister, parent, and child.
   MAJCOMs are authorized to waive this prohibition on a case-by-case basis, only when
   unusual conditions dictate.
   1.10.2. (AETC) This restriction includes all types of flights listed in Table 1.1 of the basic
   instruction.
1.11. Authorization to Perform Inflight Duties in Non-US Air Force Aircraft.
   1.11.1. With MAJCOM approval, aircrew members in active flying positions, and
   authorized operational support personnel, may perform appropriate duties in non-US Air
   Force aircraft if it is in the interest of the US Government, approved by the authority that
   controls the aircraft, the members are qualified or are authorized to receive training prior to
   qualification and, if applicable, licensed to perform such duties. Prior to authorizing these
   missions, MAJCOMs will ensure a valid requirement for a USAF aircrew member to
   operationally fly exists, which cannot be accomplished in USAF aircraft. For operational
   support flying, justification must show that qualified aircrew or operational support personnel
   of other (non-US Air Force) services or applicable organizations cannot perform such duties.
   Requests to fly solely for the purpose of qualifying for incentive pay or OFDA credit will not
   be approved.
NOTES:
1. MAJCOMs will identify approval authorities in MAJCOM Supplements. Authority may be
delegated below the MAJCOM level.
2. If the aircrew member is not assigned/attached to a MAJCOM for flying duties (such as a
Combatant Command with a geographic area of responsibility), the Air Force air operations
element within that organization will accomplish the MAJCOM function.
*3. (Added) For members who attend flying training that includes flights in non-USAF aircraft,
the orders directing such activity constitute MAJCOM approval and satisfy validation
requirements for paragraph 1.11.1. The member‘s servicing HARM office will file a copy of
the orders in the member‘s flight record folder as the source document for authorization to fly in
non-USAF aircraft.
*4. (Added) Aircrew members will perform duties associated with their current aeronautical
rating and aircrew qualification, or when specifically authorized to perform mission-related

observation or evaluation duties. If a waiver is required to accommodate unique requirements,
submit request IAW paragraph 1.7.2.
     1.11.1. (AETC) Qualified F-16 aircrew members in active flying positions assigned or
     attached to the 56 OG may perform aircrew duties in non-USAF F-16s to conduct Peace
     Carvin II and Feng Huang missions, which require members to perform aircrew duties that
     cannot be performed in USAF aircraft.
        1.11.1.1. (Added-AETC) The 56 OG will ensure all aircrew remain qualified according
        to AFI 11-2F-16; Volume 1 and Volume 2, as supplemented.
        1.11.1.2. (Added-AETC) F-16 aircrew member units will provide members‘ SARM
        offices with validated AF Forms 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification
        Worksheet, to assign the aircraft and crew positions, according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
        1.11.1.3. (Added-AETC) WG/CCs may approve individuals for orientation flights in
        Non-U.S. Air Force aircraft.
     1.11.2. Performing duties in non-US Air Force aircraft does not remove military personnel
     from line-of-duty determination status. When aircrew members are not assigned to API 7 or
     API G coded positions, MAJCOMs will provide the member‘s HARM office with a letter of
     justification authorizing the member to perform official aircrew duties in non-US Air Force
     aircraft and log flying time IAW Paragraph 3.3HARM offices will use this letter as the
     source document to assign an appropriate aircrew qualification code IAW Table A3.1.
     1.11.3. Orientation Flights in Non-US Air Force Aircraft. MAJCOMs may authorize
     orientation flights in non-US Air Force aircraft for individuals within their command who are
     otherwise eligible to fly on US Government aircraft. This authority may be delegated, but not
     lower than wing commander or equivalent level. Prior to authorizing such flights, approving
     authorities will ensure a valid requirement exists. Obtain approval from the appropriate
     authority that controls the non-USAF aircraft. The approving office will clearly indicate to
     the non-USAF controlling authority and the foreign government (as applicable) that
     acceptance of an orientation flight does not infer that the USAF/US Government will extend
     a reciprocal invitation to non-USAF or foreign government (as applicable) personnel.
     Individuals will not log flight time on orientation flights. Flights do not satisfy flight pay or
     OFDA requirements.
     1.11.4. USAF Exchange Personnel. See AFI 16-107,International Personnel Exchange
     Program,for additional guidance regarding USAF exchange personnel flying with foreign air
     forces.
     1.11.5. (Added-AETC) Qualified aircrew members assigned to active flying positions in
     the 306 FTG may perform aircrew duties within their rated specialty in the initial flight
     screening (IFS) contractor‘s aircraft. The unique mission requires syllabus execution and
     contract oversight flights that cannot be performed in USAF aircraft. AETC recognizes
     USAF aircrew qualification in the IFS contractor‘s aircraft when the aircrew member
     maintains an FAA instructor certificate with airplane category and single-engine land class
     rating.
        1.11.5.1. (Added-AETC) The IFS contractor may impose additional qualification
        requirements in accordance with the terms of the contract.
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                     37


     1.11.5.2. (Added-AETC) The 306 FTG/CC will provide the member‘s HARM office
     with a letter of justification. The HARM/SARM office will assign an appropriate aircrew
     qualification code for each member performing duties in the IFS contractor‘s aircraft.
  1.11.6. (Added-AETC) 306 FTG pilots assigned to active flying quality assurance
  evaluator positions may perform aircrew duties in non-USAF aircraft for the purpose of
  obtaining an FAA flight instructor certificate (CFI) with airplane category and single-engine
  land class rating.
     1.11.6.1. (Added-AETC) The unique IFS mission requires contract oversight flights by
     FAA CFI-rated aircrew. Training for these FAA ratings cannot be accomplished in USAF
     aircraft. AETC recognizes USAF aircrew qualification for this training by virtue of the
     Air Force pilot rating. No USAF aircraft qualification is required while in training.
     1.11.6.2. (Added-AETC) Prior to training, the 306 FTG/CC will provide the member‘s
     HARM office with a letter of justification and assign an appropriate aircrew qualification
     code for each member.
  1.11.7. (Added-AETC) Performing In-Flight Duties In Non-U. S. Air Force Aircraft
  While Deployed. Occasionally the AETC mission requires qualified crewmembers to
  perform duties and log flying time in non-U.S. Air Force aircraft (foreign or sister service).
  When deployed, aircrew members in active flying positions assigned to AETC units may be
  authorized to perform official in-flight duties in non-U.S. Air Force aircraft when tasked by
  HQ AETC provided the member has a current physical, chamber, valid (active) aeronautical
  orders, TDY orders that state the member is ―required and authorized to conduct flight
  operations in Non-U.S. Air Force aircraft,‖ and written approval from HQ AETC/A2/3/10
  prior to departure. Note: If TDY orders are not required, submit a memorandum for record
  from the unit commander justifying the requirement to perform aircrew duties, and written
  approval from HQ AETC/A2/3/10 prior to departure.
     1.11.7.1. (Added-AETC) Prior to departure, commanders must submit requests through
     the chain of command to HQ AETC/A3F for HQ AETC/A2/3/10 approval. If a member
     is not qualified in the non-USAF aircraft, include a description of the training leading to
     qualification in the request. Approval to fly non-US Air Force aircraft must be obtained
     prior to flight. Failure to receive HQ AETC/A2/3/10 approval prior to departure may
     result in loss of qualification in the member‘s current MDS, which will require
     requalification training upon return.
     1.11.7.2. (Added-AETC) Aircrew members must contact the servicing HARM office
     for assistance prior to performing in-flight duties in non-U.S. Air Force aircraft. Upon
     return, members will supply the servicing HARM with:
         1.11.7.2.1. (Added-AETC) AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, or
         equivalent, stating aircrew qualification. See AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew
         Standardization/Evaluation Program, for guidance on completing the form.
         1.11.7.2.2. (Added-AETC) AF Form 4324.
         1.11.7.2.3. (Added-AETC) AFTO Form 781 or AF IMT 3520, ARMS
         Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract, appropriately certified according to the basic
         instruction.

        1.11.7.3. (Added-AETC) Aircrew members maintaining or obtaining qualification will
        log flying time, and commanders will assign an appropriate qualification code, according
        to paragraph 3.3 of the basic instruction. Commanders will assign an appropriate
        qualification code according to the basic instruction. Aircrew members who are not
        qualified or maintaining or obtaining qualification will use the appropriate flying duty
        code of ―X‖ or ―O,‖ and log other time on the AFTO Form 781 or AF IMT 3520.
        1.11.7.4. (Added-AETC) Qualified flight surgeons, pararescue, and combat rescue
        officer personnel are authorized to perform in-flight duties and maintain flying currency
        on a foreign or sister service aircraft they are current and qualified on when in
        performance of their assigned duties. To receive credit for logging time or jumps, the
        member must provide written justification from the operational commander that he or she
        was required to perform aircrew and (or) jump duties. Aircrew members not qualified or
        obtaining qualification will use the appropriate flying duty code of ―X‖ or ―O‖ and log
        other time on the AFTO Form 781 or AF IMT 3520. An AF Form 4324 (depicting
        aircrew certification for that aircraft) and an AF IMT 1522, ARMS Additional Training
        Accomplishment Report, (showing egress and other qualifications) are required. See AFI
        11-202, Volume 1, for guidance on completing the form.
1.12. Requirements for Pilots in Dual Controlled Aircraft.
     1.12.1. Every flight in a dual-controlled aircraft requires two pilots with current qualification
     in the aircraft. Anytime an individual not fully qualified in the specific mission-design-series
     (MDS) occupies a pilot‘s seat with a set of controls, a current and qualified instructor pilot
     will occupy the other seat. EXCEPTIONS:
        1.12.1.1. If operational, command mission requirements, or MDS-specific instructions
        dictate that these requirements are not practical.
        1.12.1.2. To accommodate training programs for checkout or continuation programs.
        1.12.1.3. If the crew composition requires another rated specialty (such as a weapons
        system officer).
        1.12.1.4. To accommodate established programs (for example, indoctrination and
        orientation programs).
        1.12.1.5. Flight surgeons and MAJCOM-designated Flight Test Engineers who take part
        in flights in dual-controlled aircraft.
     1.12.2. At no time will an individual who is not fully qualified as a pilot in the specific type
     aircraft being flown occupy any pilot‘s seat (with a set of controls) with passengers on board
     the aircraft. For general officer flying, waiver authority to this guidance is AF/CC.
     EXCEPTIONS:
        1.12.2.1. To accommodate training objectives required by formal training programs. This
        exception allows passengers, who are an integral part of the mission (e.g., Pararescue,
        Rangers, CCT, SEALs, etc.) and when their presence is required by the training syllabus,

Section 2A—Flying Program

2.1. Rated Officer and Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA) Flying Program. The rated officer
and CEA inventory requires close management at all levels to ensure a high state of readiness is
maintained with available resources. The authorized rated inventory includes pilots,
navigators/combat systems operators (CSO) and air battle managers in the grade of lieutenant
colonel and below. To manage these as well as other rated/CEA aircrew positions, API codes are
assigned to identify these positions. NOTE:API codes 1-0 apply to all rated officers, and codes
A-Z apply to CEA personnel (Table 2.1).
     2.1.1. Until the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) is modified to maintain API
     effective dates and interface this data to the ARMS database, HARM offices will enter the
     API effective date in ARMS. Upon receipt and validation of MilPDS interface API change,
     enter the effective date of the API change.

support-flying priorities according to paragraph 2.9 when adequate resources are lacking.
2. ARMS automatically generates an FSC change for ASC G; no AO is required.
3. Do not process non-performance AOs for rated officers after 18 years of aviation service or
CEAs after 20 years of aviation service. Refer to AFIs 11-202, Vol 1, and 11-402 flying
evaluation board requirement procedures, for members assigned to active flying positions who

2.4. Aviation Service Code (ASC), and Flying Activity Code (FAC) EffectiveDates.
     2.4.1. Flying or parachuting duties, OFDA credit, and incentive pay start on the ASC
     effective date. Incentive pay terminates the day prior to a suspension, disqualification, or
     termination ASC effective date. Assign the ASC effective date as follows:
        2.4.1.1. Use 1 June 1974 for officers rated before 1 June 1974.
        2.4.1.2. Use the individual‘s aviation service date for medically qualified officers and
        CEAs entering formal Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT) or approved local initial
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                       55


     qualification training (IQT) flying training courses where flying is part of the course. This
     date cannot be prior to member meeting qualification requirements IAW AFI 11-402.
     2.4.1.3. Use the day after DDLDS from the losing organization for a PCS move that
     requires an ASC change. This includes inactive officers who require active AOs to attend
     formal flying training TDY enroute to PCS to an active flying assignment.
     EXCEPTIONS:
        2.4.1.3.1. Use the day a rated officer or CEA UFT graduate signs in to the
        operational unit at the permanent base following initial qualification training to
        change the FSC from "X" to "A."
        2.4.1.3.2. Use the day after departing the TDY location where initial qualification
        was completed to change FSC "X" to "A" when an officer/CEA UFT graduate
        changed base locations to his or her first operational duty assignment following
        completion of UFT, then later completed initial qualification training at another
        location.
        2.4.1.3.3. Officer/CEA UFT graduates assigned to operational duty after UFT and
        then entered into in-unit or formal training leading to initial qualification in the
        primary aircraft will retain FSC X until completion of training as documented by a
        flight evaluation, AF Form 8,Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, or AF Form
        8a,Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple Aircraft). The unit will submit an
        AF Form 4324 or an AF Form 1522 (documenting the basic qualification) to the
        HARM office to publish the AO.
        2.4.1.3.4. A previously rated officer or CEA returning to another UFT course will
        maintain their current ASC until the UFT class-start date. For example: Captain
        Lopez, a rated navigator with a current ASC of 1A is selected to attend pilot UFT.
        Captain Lopez has a PCS assignment to Laughlin AFB to attend UPT and departs
        Robins AFB on 5 Sep 05. The UFT class-start date is 15 Sep 05. The Laughlin
        HARM office changes Captain Lopez‘s ASC from 1A to 1U effective 15 Sep 05.
        2.4.1.3.5. Use the date an officer/CEA completes an in-unit or formal qualification
        training course (combined UFT/MQT) at the permanent duty station, as documented
        by an AF Form 8/8a evaluation, to publish an AO to change the member‘s FSC from
        ―U‖ to ―X.‖ Publish an AO to the change the member‘s FSC from ―X‖ to ―A‖
        effective one calendar day after the effective date of the AF Form 8/8a.
     2.4.1.4. Use the latest UFT graduation date to publish the ASC change from 1U to 1X
     (rated) or AU to AX (CEA). The UFT HARM office will publish the AO. For CEA UFTs
     without a formal graduation, use the effective date of the AF Form 8/8a.
     2.4.1.5. Use the formal jump school training (leading to the basic parachutist rating)
     class start date as the AO effective date to initiate Air Force parachutist service for
     members initially assigned to an authorized jump ("J" prefix AFSC or AFSC 1C2XX,
     1T2XX, 13DXX, 1T0XX, and 1W0XXC) UMD position. HARM offices may use TDY
     orders or formal training notification to jump school to process initial AO prior to the
     member attending training.
56                                    AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


        2.4.1.5.1. HARM offices will publish AOs for parachutists to attend HALO (High
        Altitude Low Opening) school prior to the member attending school, effective the
        class start date. Member must be on competent orders for that type of jumping and
        AOs must specify the type of pay (HALO). HALO pay will not start until the member
        performs a HALO jump. Once the member performs a HALO jump, HALO pay is
        authorized from effective date of the AO forward (if otherwise qualified). If the
        member does not complete the course, HALO pay terminates on the day the member
        is disenrolled from class. A new AO must be published effective the day after
        disenrollment to reinstate Static Line HDIP (if member returns to previous jump duty)
        or previous ASC held (prior to the class).
        2.4.1.5.2. For members approved to attend a formal jump course prior to an approved
        assignment (PCS or PCA) to a "J" prefixed AFSC or jump inherent DAFSC, the
        HARM office will publish an AO authorizing jump status effective the class start
        date. HARM offices will process an AO assigning ASC 06 effective one day after the
        course completion date. Member"s gaining HARM office will publish an AO
        authorizing active jump status again, once the member is officially assigned to the
        billet.
     2.4.1.6. Use the duty effective date for a change in duty that does not involve PCS but
     requires an ASC change (suspension/disqualification actions, flying waivers, etc.). For
     example: Member assigned to an inactive position approved for a Flying Activity Code
     (FAC) waiver to support a contingency or date a commander directs
     suspension/disqualification IAW AFI 11-402.
        2.4.1.6.1. For inactive aircrew approved to attend a formal flying qualification or
        requalification course prior to PCS or PCA to an active flying position, the HARM
        office will publish an AO assigning FAC 6/E and FSC A effective on the class start
        date. For inactive aircrew deploying to positions requiring active flying, the HARM
        office will validate the requirement to fly utilizing the member‘s deployment order
        and publish an AO assigning FAC 6/E and FSC A for the duration of the deployment,
        effective on the member‘s report date or the member‘s training/requalification start
        date, whichever is earlier. All other uses of FAC 6/E must be approved by
        MAJCOM/A3. Approval authority may not be delegated below the MAJCOM level.
        (See Table 2.2).
        2.4.1.6.2. (Added) MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent function) will coordinate on
        assignment of FAC 6/E in excess of 365 days and on any extensions that would
        continue assignment of FAC 6/E beyond 365 days.
     2.4.1.7. For rated officers/CEAs required to perform air battle staff, airborne emergency
     actions officer, combat rescue officer, mission crew commander, RP, IIO, or other duties
     that do not fall under the operational support program, use the effective and termination
     dates of the duty orders to authorize FAC 8. FAC 8 terminates upon completion of flying
     duties. Rated or CEA personnel not already receiving ACIP or CEFIP are eligible to
     receive HDIP IAW AFI 11-421 for the duty period (if otherwise qualified); OFDA, ACIP
     and CEFIP are not authorized for these duties. Do not change the ASC for a rated officer
     or CEA. Assign ASC 9C for non-rated/non-CEA members who perform this duty.
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                   57


     2.4.1.8. Use the effective date of the new API code for a change from inactive flying
     status to active flying status or vice versa.
     2.4.1.9. Rated officers. Use the anniversary date (same month and day) plus 12, 18, 22
     (if applicable), and 25 years of aviation service when passing an OFDA milestone.
     2.4.1.10. CEAs. Use the anniversary date (same month and day) plus 10, 15, 20, or 25
     years of aviation service, when passing an OFDA milestone.
     2.4.1.11. Parachutists. Publish AOs only for individuals assigned to authorized
     permanent (UMD "J" prefix or DAFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX and 1T0XX) positions,
     on temporary or permissive jump status, or for USAFA cadets enrolled in approved jump
     programs. Process commander requests to initiate jump status IAW AFI 11-410. Process
     disqualification requests IAW AFI 11-402.
        2.4.1.11.1. The AO effective date will be the date the member is assigned to a
        designated Unit Manpower Document (UMD) position that requires active jump
        status ("J" prefix DAFSC or AFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX and 1T0XX) IAW AFI
        11-410 without a PCS change, or the date a member is authorized attachment to
        another US military unit requiring active parachute duty. The HARM office publishes
        AOs, assigning ASC 9E for jump duty only or 9D if the member is assigned to duty
        that requires both aircrew and parachutist qualification IAW AFI 11-401. The AO
        must specify type of jump duty required and pay authorized.
        2.4.1.11.2. For an officer/enlisted member qualified for parachutist service who is
        authorized temporary jump status IAW AFI 11-410, publish an AO with a start date
        established in the commander‘s request letter and with a termination date not to
        exceed 180 days. For example, a qualified parachutist, currently not assigned to a ―J‖
        coded UMD position is approved to provide manning assistance on a Joint Readiness
        Exercise from 19 Jul 05 through 23 Sep 05. The HARM office would publish an AO
        effective 19 July 05, with a termination date of 23 Sep 05. AO remarks will reference
        approval letter justification.
        2.4.1.11.3. For an officer/enlisted member authorized permissive jump status IAW
        AFI 11-410, publish an AO with a start date established in the commander‘s request
        letter; the termination date will not exceed 12 months. Do not change the ASC or
        authorize HDIP.
        2.4.1.11.4. If a parachutist reenlists without a break in service, publish a new AO to
        change only the termination date. If otherwise qualified, incentive pay and badge
        creditable months continue through this period.
        2.4.1.11.5. Publish a new AO when type of jump duty changes (static/HALO).
        Member must be required to perform HALO duty to be eligible for the HALO
        incentive pay rate. This includes attending HALO school (reference Paragraph
        2.4.1.5.1). If a member is in a HALO-authorized manning position and departs PCS
        to a position that does not require HALO jumping, publish a new AO authorizing
        static jumping/pay only.
        2.4.1.11.6. Use the day a member is no longer assigned to an authorized UMD
        parachutist position ("J" prefix, AFSC or AFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX and
58                                    AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


        1T0XX) IAW AFI 11-410 to assign ASC 06 (Conditional HDIP—Flying/Jump
        requirement terminated) at the same duty location.This includes members who retrain
        out of parachutist duties or members who are assigned to a unit that has no available
        jump authorizations (manning in excess of total UMD authorizations).
        2.4.1.11.7. Use the day after departed last duty station or jump school for members
        who PCS to a base without an available UMD parachutist position ("J" prefix, AFSC
        or AFSC 1C2XX, 1T2XX, 13DXX and 1T0XX) IAW AFI 11-410 to remove the
        parachutist from parachute duty and assign ASC 06 (Conditional HDIP—
        Flying/Jump requirements terminated).
        2.4.1.11.8. HARM offices will publish AOs for USAFA cadets and other approved
        Air Force members participating in jump related duties as part of the USAFA
        Airmanship Program. Use the effective date of entry to the USAFA Airmanship
        Program. The effective period of the AO authorizing parachutist service is limited to
        the period of training at the USAFA. Do not assign an aviation service code. Leave
        the ASC section of the AO blank. Neither jump duty credit nor jump incentive pay
        are authorized.
     2.4.1.12. Non-rated officer and non-CEA enlisted aircrew members. The effective
     period of an AO authorizing aviation service as a non-rated aircrew member is limited by
     the member‘s duty availability. The member must be assigned to an aircrew-prefixed
     manpower position on the UMD. For members initially beginning aviation status, the AO
     effective date is the date the member is certified for aircrew duty and is entered into a
     formal school where in-flight duties (not observation) are part of the course curriculum.
     Example: On 1 Jun 05, a member reported to the base for aircrew duty. On 15 Jun 05, the
     commander certified eligibility and assigned the member to an aircrew-prefixed
     manpower position on the UMD. On 1 Jul 05, the member commenced TDY to begin
     formal flying training. The initial AO effective date is 1 July 05. For in-unit initial
     training, the AO is effective when formal in-flight flying training begins after being
     assigned to an authorized aircrew position within a unit. For example: On 1 May 05, a
     member reported to a base for aircrew duty. On 15 May 05, the commander certified
     eligibility, assigned the member to the appropriate UMD aircrew prefixed DAFSC, and
     notified the HARM office of in-flight training start date. On 20 May 05, the member
     began formal in-unit flying training. The AO effective date is 20 May 05; however, the
     initial training must lead toward initial qualification.
        2.4.1.12.1. For previous non-rated/non-CEA inactive aircrew members assigned to
        an active flying position at the gaining unit, HARM offices will assign ASC 9D
        (Active Non-rated Aircrew Member) effective one day after member departed last
        duty station, providing the member is qualified for aircrew duty and is assigned to an
        authorized non-rated/non-CEA aircrew "X," "K," or "Q" UMD DAFSC position, not
        occupied by another active flyer. If there was no PCS involved, use the effective date
        of duty (if otherwise qualified). See AFI 11-402 for limitations on exceeding UMD
        manpower authorizations for non-rated/non-CEA aircrew positions.
        2.4.1.12.2. Use the date the non-rated/non-CEA aircrew member is no longer
        assigned to an authorized aircrew "X," "K," or "Q" prefixed UMD manpower position
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                         59


           to terminate aviation service and assign ASC 9J (Inactive-Restricted). This paragraph
           also applies to members approved for retraining.
           2.4.1.12.3. If a non-rated aircrew member reenlists without a break in service,
           publish a new AO to change only the termination date. If otherwise qualified,
           incentive pay and badge creditable months continue through this period.
       2.4.1.13. Operational Support Members. IAW AFI 11-402, use the effective date
       when man-months are authorized, not to exceed a one-month period.
   2.4.2. (Added-AETC) A first-assignment instructor pilot (FAIP) will remain in ASC 1X
   status until awarded IP qualification. The effective date of the initial instructor evaluation
   will be the effective date of changing the FAIP‘s ASC from 1X to 1A.
2.5. Operational Flying Duty. Operational flying duty is flying duty performed under
competent orders while serving in assignments in which flying skills are maintained in the
performance of assigned duties. The Aviation CareerIncentive Act of 1974,theAviation Career
Improvement Act of 1989,and the FY 1996National Defense Authorization Actestablished
months of operational flying duty accumulation (OFDA) required for entitlement to continuous
monthly incentive pay for specific years of aviation service. Current legal authority is established
in the US Code. Table 2.7 shows OFDA requirements for each of the establishing acts.

2.6. Transition Status Codes (TSC). Transition Status Codes were established to track the
OFDA requirements for rated officers affected by the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the
Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989,and the FY 1996National Defense Authorization Act.
Table 2.8lists and defines TSCs. Figure 2.3provides a timeline chart based on aviation service
dates and provides additional guidance to aid in determining a member‘s TSC. Table 2.9shows
OFDA requirements based on the member‘s TSC.

Figure 2.3. TSC Timeline Chart.




1. Aircrew members assigned TSC "D" or "E" are grandfathered under the ACIA of 1974.
2. Aircrew members assigned TSC "A" require 96 months OFDA at 12 years to receive
continuous pay until 18 years, and 120 or 144 months OFDA at 18 years to receive continuous
ACIP until 22 years or 25 years respectively.
3. Aircrew members with an ASD between 2 Oct 1979 and 1 Oct 1985 inclusive, who
accumulated at least 72 months of OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, are assigned TSC "C".
          Example A. If a member in this status accumulated 72-107 months OFDA as of 1 Oct
          1991, he/she was entitled to continuous ACIP until 18 years.
          Example B. If the member accumulated 108-131 months OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991,
          he/she was entitled to continuous ACIP until 22 years.
          Example C. If the member accumulated at least 132 months OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991,
          he/she was entitled to continuous ACIP until 25 years.
          Example D. Members assigned TSC "C" with less than 132 months OFDA as of 1
          Oct 1991, were reviewed again at 18 years to determine appropriate incentive pay
          action.
       4. Aircrew members with an ASD between 2 Oct 1979 and 1 Oct 1985 inclusive, who
       accumulated less than 72 months of OFDA as of 1 Oct 1991, were assigned TSC "B."
          Example A. Members assigned TSC "B," with an ASD of 2 Oct 1979 – 9 Feb 1984
          inclusive, require 108 months OFDA at the 12-year point to receive continuous ACIP
          until 18 years.
          Example B. Members assigned TSC ―B,‖ with an ASD of 10 Feb 1984 or after,
          require 96 months OFDA at the 12-year point to receive continuous ACIP until 18
          years.
          Example C. Members assigned TSC ―B‖ who did not meet the 12-year requirement,
          but accumulated at least 72 months OFDA at the 12-year point, were assigned ASC
          ―5Y‖ and were reviewed again at the 15-year point.

2.7. Rated Officer and Career Enlisted Aviator Operational Flying Duty. To control the
award of operational flying duty credit required by public law, HARM offices must assign active
operational fliers (FSC A) who fail to perform flying duties to a temporary status, FSC S
(Inactive-Nonperformance) effective the first day of the fourth month of inactivity. FSC S will
remain valid until: the member accomplishes an OFDA-creditable flight; is disqualified for
Aviation Service; or is reassigned to non-flying duty. Active rated officers and CEAs
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                       63


recommended for DNIF are identified in ARMS by a physical availability date and code. When
the DNIF is expected to last more than 30 days or has lasted for 30 days, ARMS automatically
reports the member on the Consolidated Headquarters Aviation Resource Management System
interface as FSC G. (The FSC G is for reporting purposes only.) An AO change is not necessary.
Members continue to accumulate OFDA credit until FSC S applies.
   2.7.1. As defined by public law, operational flying duty is flying performed under competent
   orders by rated or designated members while serving in assignments in which basic flying
   skills are normally maintained in the performance of assigned duties as determined by the
   Secretary concerned, and flying performed by members in training that leads to the award of
   an aeronautical rating or designation. Rated officers and CEAs must attain and maintain, as a
   minimum, basic aircraft qualification in mission or support aircraft. One of the following
   indicates the need to fly:
       2.7.1.1. The assigned API code associated with a specific position.
       2.7.1.2. Assignment to a formal course of flying instruction.
       2.7.1.3. A case-by-case determination by AF/A3O-A when unusual circumstances
       dictate.
   2.7.2. The requirement for the Air Force to track the flying activity of rated members, other
   than flight surgeons and UFT students, is based upon the Aviation Career Incentive Act of
   1974, the Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989, the FY 96 National Defense
   Authorization Act(NDAA), and the FY 99 NDAA. These acts established the criteria to
   determine eligibility for ACIP. The requirement to track flight activity of CEAs is based
   upon the FY 00 NDAA. Title 37 US Code, Chapter 5, Article 301a provides current public
   law guidance on ACIP and OFDA requirements.
       2.7.2.1. The 1974 Act set standards of minimum experience necessary to receive ACIP:
       at least 72 months (6 years) of operational flying completed prior to the 12th year of
       aviation service and 108 months (9 years) of flying completed by the 18th year of
       aviation service. Individuals meeting these requirements were, if otherwise qualified
       (medically and physiologically [if applicable]), entitled to continuous ACIP until the
       22nd year of officer service (using an individual‘s OSD), without meeting a specific
       flying performance standard. Members who completed at least 132 months (11 years) of
       operational flying by the 18th year of aviation service received, if otherwise qualified,
       continuous entitlement to ACIP until the 25th year of officer service. Those who failed to
       meet the standards were conditionally entitled to ACIP only through a minimum
       performance standard by flying an average of four hours per month (two hours for ARC
       members) while assigned to operational flying duties. In addition, rated officers with over
       25 years of officer service (grade O-6 and below) and assigned to operational flying
       positions were eligible to receive conditional ACIP.
       2.7.2.2. The 1989 Act modified the required OFDA months rated officers must achieve
       for ACIP entitlement. The new law established revised OFDA requirements of 108
       months (9 years), 120 months (10 years), and 144 months (12 years) from the previous
       requirements of 72 months (6 years), 108 months (9 years), and 132 months (11 years).
       The effective date for the new criteria was 1 October 1991. On 1 October 1991, the
       USAF began transition to the new requirement structure and rated members were
64                                        AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


        assigned Transition Status Codes (TSC) in order to determine OFDA requirements. Rated
        officers with ASDs of 1 October 1985 and later were required to meet the 9, 10, and 12-
        year OFDA requirements under the ACIA of 1989.
        2.7.2.3. The FY 96 NDAA modified the requirements rated officers must achieve for
        ACIP entitlement established by the 1989 Act. The new law established revised OFDA
        requirements for rated members who completed, or would complete, 12 years of aviation
        service on or after 10 Feb 1996. Rated members assigned TSC A must have accumulated
        8 years or more of OFDA months within their first 12 years of aviation service to qualify
        for continuous ACIP through 18 years of aviation service. Rated members who
        completed 12 or more years of aviation service prior to 10 Feb 1996 must have
        accumulated at least 9 years of OFDA within their first 12 years of aviation service to
        qualify for continuous ACIP through 18 years of aviation service. Rated members who
        did not meet the applicable standard for entitlement to continuous ACIP remained
        entitled to conditional ACIP contingent upon meeting the monthly flying hour
        requirement.
        2.7.2.4. The FY 99 NDAA changed the way ACIP entitlement was computed for all
        rated officers. Previously, eligibility determination was based on the anniversary of the
        Officer Service Date (OSD). The FY 99 NDAA changed eligibility determination to the
        anniversary of the ASD. This change did not apply to those aviators who had passed 22
        or 25 years of OSD and had ACIP terminated under the ACIA of 1974.
        2.7.2.5. The FY 00 NDAA set minimum experience levels required for CEAs to receive
        continuous CEFIP: at least 72 months (6 years) of operational flying completed prior to
        the 10year of aviation service, 108 months (9 years) of flying completed by the 15year of
        aviation service, and 168 months (14 years) completed by the 20year of aviation service.
        CEAs who meet these requirements and are medically, professionally and, if required,
        physiologically qualified, are entitled to continuous CEFIP until their 25year of aviation
        service and without regard to a specific flying performance standard. Members who fail
        to meet standards for entitlement to continuous CEFIP are entitled to conditional CEFIP
        if they are assigned to active operational flying duties and perform aircrew duties an
        average of four hours per month (two hours for ARC members) until they reach their next
        aviation service requirement point.
     2.7.3. OFDA Computations. To receive credit for a month of OFDA, an individual must:
        2.7.3.1. Be assigned to primary or corollary duties that require flying and perform valid
        flying duties which are authorized OFDA credit in the current month or preceding three
        months.
            2.7.3.1.1. (Added) After establishment of an ASD, ABMs assigned to OFDA-
            creditable ground based radar duties will receive OFDA credit for these duties.
        2.7.3.2. Be assigned to rated/CEA in-flight or similar RP duties while assigned FSC A,
        U, X, or Z for at least 15 days within each calendar month that earned OFDA credit from
        the current month or previous three months. Rated officers or CEA members assigned to
        an active flying billet pending a PCS assignment to an inactive billet should sign out from
        the losing base after the 15day of the month in order to receive OFDA credit for that
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                      65


       month. They must have also performed OFDA-creditable flying within three months of
       the departure month.
       2.7.3.3. Have no more than 18 years of aviation service for rated officers and 20 years of
       aviation service for career enlisted aviators. NOTE: If required, members may
       accumulate badge-creditable OFDA months toward advanced rating criteria after the 18or
       20year of aviation service. See AFI 11-402.
       2.7.3.4. Individuals initially assigned to flying duty (FSC A) or returning to such duty
       from a disqualified or inactive status, other than FSC S, receive OFDA credit from the
       date of assignment of an active FSC. If such individuals do not fly within three months of
       that date, the HARM office will retroactively change the active FSC to FSC S, effective
       the day following the date of initial assignment of the active FSC. Deduct OFDA credit
       which began accruing with assignment of the original active FSC and terminate
       entitlement to OFDA credit. Assign an active FSC when flying begins, effective two
       months before the date of the first flight. OFDA credit resumes from that date.
       EXAMPLE: Captain Wiggins is assigned FSC A on 19 December but first flies on 17
       April: On 20 March, the HARM changes the FSC A to FSC S, effective 20 December.
       Captain Wiggins accumulated three months OFDA credit for January, February, and
       March. (Do not credit December because Capt Wiggins was assigned an active FSC for
       less than 15 days during that month.) The FSC S action deducts the three months credited
       and stops further accumulation. On 17 April, change the FSC S to FSC A, effective 17
       February. This retroactive change restarts OFDA credit. Do not award OFDA credit for
       February (less than 15 days assigned), but award credit for March and April. Credit
       continues to accumulate until the individual fails to perform for a period greater than
       three months.
       2.7.3.5. When aircrew members who are actively flying prior to reaching 18 years (rated)
       and 20 years (CEA) of aviation service do not perform by the end of the third month
       following the month in which flying duties were last performed, change FSC to "S"
       effective the first day of the fourth month following the month in which flying duties
       were last performed and stop OFDA credit. Change the FSC to "A" again effective the
       date of the member‘s next OFDA-creditable flight. Do not award retroactive credit.
       EXAMPLE: Lt Ostrowski flew on 14 May and did not fly again until 18 November: The
       HARM office assigns FSC S on 1 September. Credit OFDA for May, June, July, and
       August. The HARM office changes the FSC back to "A" on 18 November. There is no
       OFDA credit for November because the member was assigned FSC A for less than 15
       days during that month. OFDA credit is not earned in September and October.
       2.7.3.6. (Added) Unit commanders will notify the servicing HARM office when an
       ABM assigned to OFDA-creditable ground based radar duties prior to reaching 18 years
       of aviation service does not perform crew duties by the end of the third month following
       the month in which crew duties were last performed. HARM office personnel will
       change the member‘s FSC to S effective the first day of the fourth month following the
       month in which crew duties were last performed and stop OFDA credit. Change the FSC
       to B effective the date the member resumes crew duties. Do not award retroactive credit.
2.8. OFDA Waivers. Operational flying duty requirements for officers and CEAs are
established by public law: Title 37, U.S. Code, Chapter 5. IAW AFI 36-2110,Assignments, it is
66                                         AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


Air Force policy that as many rated officers as possible complete at least 10 years (120 months)
of operational flying by the 18th year of aviation service, however not all officers will fulfill the
requirements to receive ACIP through 25 years of aviation service. For CEAs, Air Force policy
is to manage CEAs to complete at least 9 years (108 months) of operational flying by the 15year
of aviation service; not all CEAs will fulfill the requirements to receive CEFIP through 25 years
of aviation service. The Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989 and FY 00 NDAA authorized
the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) to waive OFDA requirements for rated officers and
CEAs who are unable to meet their flying requirements due to reasons beyond their control. Each
year, MAJCOM commanders may submit nominations for Lieutenant Colonels and below and
SMSgts and below to AF/A3O-AT, for Colonels (and selectees) to AF/DPO, and for CMSgts
(and selectees) to AF/DPE, for review and staffing to SECAF. To implement this program the
following procedures apply:
     2.8.1. Rated officers assigned TSCs A, B, C, and CEAs are eligible for OFDA waivers.
     Because TSC D and E rated officers were grandfathered to the pre-ACIA of 1989 OFDA
     requirements, they are not eligible for waivers. Candidate rated officers must have at least 72
     months (6 years) of OFDA credit to apply for a waiver. CEAs must accomplish at least 60
     months (5 years) of operational flying during the first 10 years of aviation service, or 96
     months (8 years) of operational flying duties during the first 15 years of aviation service to
     apply for a waiver. Officers and CEAs who have not accumulated the minimum number of
     months shown above are not eligible for waiver consideration. By direction of the SECAF,
     third gate waivers, for individuals to receive ACIP or CEFIP through 25 years of aviation
     service when OFDA requirements have not been met, will not be considered.
        2.8.1.1. When retroactive waivers are approved by SECAF for rated officers who obtain
        72 months of OFDA credit after the 12th of aviation service, members will be authorized
        continuous entitlement to ACIP from the month in which they completed 72 months
        credit. (Members are not qualified for continuous entitlement prior to meeting
        qualification requirements.)EXAMPLE: Major Farrell reached his 12th year of aviation
        service on 18 January 04 and had accumulated 60 months of OFDA credit, 36 months
        short of the 12 year requirement, and was assigned ASC 5A, conditional entitlement
        status. Effective 17 January 05 he accumulated 72 months of OFDA and applied for a
        waiver of his 12th year requirement on that date. SECAF approved a 24-month OFDA
        waiver on 15 June 05 and Major Farrell‘s HARM office was directed to publish an AO
        changing Major Farrell‘s ASC from 5A to 2A and start continuous ACIP effective 17
        January 05.NOTE:CEAs are not eligible for retroactive waivers.
        2.8.1.2. For OFDA waiver requests submitted from the MAJCOM or equivalent, and
        approved by SECAF prior to loss of continuous pay, members will be authorized
        continuous entitlement to ACIP or CEFIP from the requirement anniversary date (if
        otherwise qualified).
        2.8.1.3. For OFDA waiver requests submitted from the MAJCOM or equivalent, and
        approved by SECAF after the loss of continuous pay, members will be authorized
        entitlement to ACIP or CEFIP from the date the member submitted the original request to
        the first office in the member‘s MAJCOM or equivalent chain of command (if otherwise
        qualified). See also Paragraph 2.8.9.
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                        67


  2.8.2. MAJCOM commanders may submit OFDA waiver nominations only when the
  member failed to achieve requirements due to reasons beyond his or her control. Examples
  include, but are not limited to: banked UPT graduates, extended DNIFs, rated officers
  assigned to deactivating/draw down flying units or Air Liaison Officer assignments who
  cannot be placed into another flying position prior to completion of 120 months of OFDA
  credit at 18 years of aviation service, rated officers assigned to non-flying duties necessary to
  comply with the requirements of the Goldwater-Nichols Act (joint duty schools/follow-on
  tours) or the Acquisition Public Law, and CEAs assigned to inactive flying billets to perform
  UAS sensor operator duties.
     2.8.2.1. Officers and CEAs selected for highly competitive and nominative assignments
     merit OFDA waiver consideration, when those assignments are specifically responsible
     for rated officers and CEAs failing to accomplish OFDA requirements. Should such
     assignments jeopardize the achievement of OFDA requirements, place appropriate
     documentation in the member‘s personnel record. Documentation will include reasons
     why the member was assigned to a non-flying position (see Paragraph 2.8.7).
  2.8.3. Rated officers receiving acquisition bonus monies may not be eligible for OFDA
  waivers.
  2.8.4. Months lost due to time spent under flying status code K (inactive--lack of support) do
  not meet OFDA waiver criteria unless the officer or CEA was assigned to a unit undergoing
  draw down or conversion to an aircraft in which the individual‘s specialty was not required
  (i.e., an F-4 navigator assigned to a unit converting to single-place fighters), or when the unit
  aircraft was operationally grounded (paragraph 1.3.2). Individuals must meet both K code
  and draw down, conversion, or grounding criteria to be considered for a waiver.
  EXCEPTION: Members in active flying assignments assigned flying status code K while
  deployed TDY to non-flying assignments IAW Table 2.6 are eligible for waiver
  consideration.
  2.8.5. DELETED
  2.8.6. Individuals who voluntarily turn down a flying opportunity or elect to move to a non-
  flying position which would preclude the possibility of meeting OFDA requirements are not
  eligible for OFDA waivers (except as provided for in paragraph 2.8.2.1). When an
  individual declines an opportunity to fly and is selected for a non-flying assignment,
  document this action in the member‘s personnel record, as specified in Paragraph 2.8.7.
  Reference the flying assignment that was declined.
  2.8.7. AFPC, HQ USAF, or MAJCOM assignment officers, as applicable, will document
  that the above situations existed at the time of assignment to establish an audit trail.
  (MAJCOMs will verify flying status code K criteria.) This may then be used to verify why
  OFDA waiver candidates were unable to accomplish OFDA requirements.
  2.8.8. MAJCOM commanders will forward OFDA waiver nominations for Lieutenant
  Colonels and below and SMSgts and below to AF/A3O-AT, for Colonels (and selectees) to
  HQ AF/DPO, and for CMSgts (and selectees) to AF/DPE. If submission is not warranted,
  MAJCOM commanders may deny requests.
  2.8.9. Submit OFDA waiver requests to the servicing HARM office no earlier than the year
  prior to loss of flight pay. HARM offices will staff requests to the MAJCOM. For members
68                                        AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


     assigned to Headquarters, USAF, submit waivers through the individual‘s supervisory chain
     of command (A1, A3, A4, etc.), then to A3O-AT, DPO, or DPE; submit waivers for Colonels
     to AF/CVA prior to routing to AF/DPO. For members not assigned to an Air Force
     MAJCOM (i.e. members assigned to organizations such as USCENTCOM, USPACOM, or
     USSTRATCOM), individuals will submit packages to their servicing Air Force HARM
     office, which will staff packages to the MAJCOM that is in the HARM office‘s chain of
     command. As a minimum, the submission will include the member‘s dated request letter,
     Aviation Service Worksheet, justification for OFDA request, Military Personnel Data System
     duty history (SURF), and any other documents to support justification. MAJCOMs will
     coordinate with AFPC to ensure support for packages when waivers are based on assignment
     actions. Packages forwarded to HAF for SECAF approval must also contain MAJCOM/CC
     (or equivalent) indorsement. It is the responsibility of the member submitting the OFDA
     waiver request to establish adequate justification for waiver consideration.
        2.8.9.1. HARM offices will review the package for accuracy and validate eligibility
        criteria IAW this instruction. Review ARMS data/member‘s FRF to validate TSC code.
        Do not forward OFDA waiver request packages for members with TSC D or E. See also
        Paragraph 2.8.1.
        2.8.9.2. Commanders ensure eligible members submit waiver packages within the year
        prior to the applicable aviation service point for which the member requests an OFDA
        waiver.
            2.8.9.2.1. If a rated officer requests waiver of OFDA requirements, submit the
            package during: (a) the 11th year of aviation service for a waiver of the 12-year
            requirement or (b) the 17th year of aviation service for a waiver of the 18 year/120-
            month requirement.
            2.8.9.2.2. If a CEA requests waiver of OFDA requirements, submit the package
            during: (a) the 9th year of aviation service for a waiver of the 10-year requirement or
            (b) the 14th year of aviation service for a waiver of the 15 year/108-month
            requirement.
     2.8.10. Eligibility Criteria for Air Battle Manager OFDA waivers. In addition to meeting
     established criteria in this section (paragraph 2.8), an ABM must have an established ASD
     and be eligible to receive ACIP.
        2.8.10.1. (DELETED) .
        2.8.10.2. (DELETED) .
        2.8.10.3. (DELETED) .
        2.8.10.4. (DELETED) .
     2.8.11. AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE will verify that packages meet eligibility criteria.
     AF/A3O-AT (or AF/DPO/DPE) and AF/A1 staff representatives will review packages. If all
     offices concur, nominations will be forwarded through the HAF chain of command to
     SECAF for consideration of an OFDA waiver. Packages that do not meet eligibility criteria
     will be returned to the MAJCOM. Waivers will be approved only for the minimum months
     required.
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                        69


   2.8.12. MAJCOMs are responsible to ensure each individual eligible for an OFDA waiver is
   considered for a waiver.
       2.8.12.1. The MAJCOM OFDA waiver process must include Operations Staff (A3) and
       Personnel Staff (A1) to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations and laws.
       MAJCOMs will coordinate with AFPC/AFCMO to ensure support for packages when
       waivers are based on assignment actions. Each submission must include the items
       specified in Paragraph 2.8.9, above.
       2.8.12.2. Prior to MAJCOM/CC approval, MAJCOMs may send OFDA waiver packages
       to AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE for an informal review. MAJCOMs will provide
       the initial review function. If the package needs revision, MAJCOMs will accomplish this
       prior to submission to HAF agencies. If requested, AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE
       will provide a recommendation to the submitting MAJCOM staff with an assessment of
       the validity of each case.
   2.8.13. AFRC and ANG will develop initial MAJCOM procedures for reviewing OFDA
   waiver packages. Following MAJCOM/CC approval, forward OFDA waiver packages to
   AF/A3O-AT, AF/DPO, or AF/DPE for processing and final action.
   2.8.14. (Added) Individuals who receive an OFDA waiver are not eligible for a second
   OFDA waiver. For individuals who receive waivers, the specific eligibility requirement is
   waived for the member; members are not granted additional months of OFDA credit to meet
   the established requirement.
2.9. Taking Part in Flying by Rated Officers. Public law and DoD directives restrict active
rated flying to officers in positions that require members to maintain flying skills. If certain
SECAF approved mission requirements are more than the number of such officers locally
assigned, a minimum number of other qualified members of the authorized rated inventory may
also be assigned rated aircrew duties.
   2.9.1. Flying duties are assigned in the following precedence:
       2.9.1.1. API 1 or 2 officers assigned to support the weapon system crew ratio.
       2.9.1.2. Student officers assigned to a formal course of flying training.
       2.9.1.3. Officers assigned to positions coded API 6 or 8.
       2.9.1.4. Officers assigned to positions at MAJCOM or FOA level or below coded API 3
       or 4, or non-rated (API 0). Assign such officers to rated aircrew duties on the basis of the
       most recent aviation service date, if:
           2.9.1.4.1. The assignment provides at least 24 months of local flying availability (12
           months at short tour bases).
           2.9.1.4.2. The flying assignment is to an approved operational support mission
           specifically designated by HQ USAF.
       2.9.1.5. Crewmembers will not perform flight duties while on leave, permissive TDY,
       non-flying TDY, or participating in an orientation flight, unless required to perform
       official aircrew duties. EXCEPTION: Members on terminal leave, who are otherwise
       eligible to fly, may perform flight duties and participate in orientation flights.
70                                         AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


        2.9.1.5. (AETC) The NAF/CC is the approval authority for crewmembers to fly when
        they are required to perform official aircrew duties. Forward requests through wing
        channels to NAF/DO for NAF/CC approval.
     2.9.2. Special Circumstances.
        2.9.2.1. If special circumstances require active temporary operational flying that is not
        IAW paragraph 2.9.1, MAJCOM/A3 may approve exceptions on an individual case
        basis (FAC 6/E waiver). See Table 2.2
        2.9.2.2. If special circumstances require rated officers to perform temporary in-flight
        non-rated or non-crew (operational support) duties, HARM offices will assign FAC 8.
        For rated officers who were in inactive status, publish an AO assigning FAC 8, FSC J,
        and include in the remarks section of AO: "Rated Officer assigned to perform in-flight
        non-rated (or non-crew) duties." Officers performing non-rated duties will log aircrew
        certification code "Z" on the AFTO Form 781; flight time does not count towards OFDA
        or ACIP entitlement.
     2.9.3. Do not assign active flying duties to members scheduled for an academic instruction
     course of 180 days or longer. The HARM office will assign FSC L to these members.
     2.9.4. Reserve officers not on extended active duty (EAD) may be assigned to inactive rated
     positions (API 3 or API 4).
        2.9.4.1. Send requests for removing Reservists from flying to AFRC/A3TS (with copies
        to AF/REO and AF/A3O-AT) for approval.
        2.9.4.2. Send requests for removing ANG personnel from flying to NGB/CF (with a
        copy to AF/A3O-AT) for approval.
     2.9.5. (Added) Rated officers assigned to API-0 billets may fly on a non-interference basis
     when required. Incentive pay and OFDA credit are not authorized for non-interference
     flying. Members will not log flying time on the AFTO form 781. (See also paragraph
     2.12.4.)
2.10. Flight Surgeon Flying Policy.
     2.10.1. To be assigned to active flying status, a flight surgeon must be medically qualified,
     physiologically qualified (if applicable), and maintain flight medicine credentials. To receive
     conditional ACIP, active flight surgeons must be assigned to an API 5 unit manpower
     document (UMD) position with Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC) 48XX, or 40C0C
     with an additional AFSC of 48XX, be on active flying status AOs, and be qualified in the
     aircraft. IAW DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 7a,Military Pay Policy and Procedures - Active
     Duty and Reserve Pay, flight surgeons are conditional fliers and qualify for entitlement to
     conditional ACIP by completing the prescribed number of operational flying hours per
     month.
     2.10.1. (AETC) Flight surgeons may only control the aircraft or mission equipment during
     noncritical phases of flight. In multi-place aircraft, a qualified instructor pilot approved by
     squadron supervision must be at the other set of controls. Flight surgeons will not be at a set
     of controls with passengers onboard. In other crew positions, a qualified crewmember
     approved by squadron supervision must be immediately available to control mission
     equipment. Flight surgeons will not occupy a nonpilot crew position during a phase when the
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                       71


   pilot in command determines a current and qualified crewmember (in that position) is
   required to accomplish the mission.
      2.10.1.1. When a flight surgeon is assigned to an API coded ―0‖ position, the HARM
      office will terminate active flying AOs and assign the member ASC 8J. Inactive flight
      surgeons may be authorized to fly and log time without ACIP on a noninterference basis
      with unit training and flying schedules. Flight surgeons not qualified in an aircraft, on
      inactive AOs, will log only ―Other‖ flight time and include remarks on the reverse side of
      AFTO Form 781 (for example, ―Inactive flight surgeon,‖ or ―Flight surgeon not qualified
      in aircraft‖).Paragraph 2.16.3through 2.16.5apply.
      2.10.1.2. (Added-AETC) Critical phases of flight, under this status, are defined as
      portions of the flight requiring current and qualified crewmembers to control the aircraft
      or mission equipment, including takeoffs and landings, air refueling, live hoist-
      operations, night vision goggle (NVG) operations, weapons delivery, flights below 1,000
      feet above ground level (AGL) for fixed-wing aircraft, and airdrops.
   2.10.2. A flight surgeon possessing an additional pilot or navigator rating and assigned to an
   API 5 flight surgeon position flies only as a flight surgeon, unless selected and approved as a
   pilot-physician or navigator-physician IAW AFI 11-405. Pilot-physicians/navigator-
   physicians assigned to active flying positions (API 1/2) fly as line pilots/navigators. AF/A3/5
   authorizes exceptions upon request, based on justification provided by the Surgeon General
   (AF/SG). Flight surgeons who hold valid pilot or navigator ratings are entitled to conditional
   ACIP only; OFDA credit is not authorized, even when members are assigned to API 1/2
   positions.
   2.10.3. Pilot-Physicians Procedures. AFI 11-405,The Pilot-Physician Program, prescribes
   procedures for the US Air Force Pilot-Physician Program. Pilot-physicians remain
   conditional fliers for ACIP entitlement and do not earn OFDA credit. Except as noted above,
   active flying pilot-physicians will be assigned ASC 8A, FAC 9, and API 5, and hold DAFSC
   48VX. Retain members in ASC 8 beyond 25 years of aviation service. Credit flight time
   logged as a pilot towards advanced pilot and flight surgeon ratings (only when member is
   assigned FAC 9) and ACIP entitlement.
   2.10.4. Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATT) Procedures. Active and inactive
   flight surgeons may be tasked to assist CCATTs with patients on a mission.
      2.10.4.1. Active flight surgeons assigned to API 5 positions, with ASC 8A, are
      authorized to log crew position "FS" and primary time on all USAF aircraft missions
      based on their aircraft qualification.
      2.10.4.2. Inactive flight surgeons assigned to API 0 positions, in ASC 8J and tasked to
      perform CCATT non-crew duties, are authorized to log "FZ" crew position and primary
      time on these missions. Flight time may only be logged when critical care patients are
      onboard. When authorized, the member"s HARM office will process the operational
      support AO. Assign FAC 8, and include AO remarks: "Rated officer tasked to perform
      CCATT non-crew FAC 8 duties. Crew position FZ and non-crew HDIP authorized." The
      member"s ASC remains ASC 8J.
2.11. Taking Part in Flying by Career Enlisted Aviators.

     2.11.1. Flying duties are assigned in the following precedence:
        2.11.1.1. API A or B CEAs assigned to support the weapon system crew ratio, flying
        training instruction duty, operational test and evaluation functions, Foreign Military Sales
        (FMS), etc.
        2.11.1.2. Students assigned to a formal course of flying training.
        2.11.1.3. Career enlisted aviators assigned to positions coded API B or D.
        2.11.1.4. Career enlisted aviators assigned to positions at MAJCOM or FOA level or
        below coded API C or E. Assign career enlisted aviators API C or E aircrew duties on the
        basis of the most recent aviation service and be careful not to cause the member to fall
        short of meeting OFDA credit.
     2.11.2. Do not assign active flying duties to members who are scheduled for an academic
     instruction course of 180 days or more.
     2.11.3. Crewmembers will not perform flying duties while on leave, permissive TDY, non-
     flying TDY, or participating in an orientation flight, unless required to perform their official
     aircrew duties.
     2.11.4. If special circumstances require active temporary flying that is not IAW paragraph
     2.11.1, MAJCOM/A3 may approve exceptions on an individual case basis (FAC E waiver).
     2.11.5. (Added) CEAs assigned to API-Z billets may fly on a non-interference basis when
     required. Incentive pay and OFDA credit are not authorized for non-interference flying.
     Members will not log flying time on the AFTO Form 781. (See also paragraph 2.12.4.)
     2.11.5. (AETC) For detailed information regarding flying while assigned to operations
     group superintendent positions, see paragraph A7.11.
2.12. Taking Part in Flying by Non-rated Officer Aircrew Members and Non-CEA
Enlisted Aircrew Members.
     2.12.1. Non-rated officer and non-CEA enlisted aircrew members (FSC D) are qualified
     personnel assigned to designated aircrew positions. Non-rated aircrew members are included
     onboard aircraft when their presence is required for the aircraft to accomplish its primary
     tasked mission. This is their full-time duty. When a full-time presence is not required,
     operational support flying may be applicable (see Paragraph 2.12.2). Non-rated aircrew
     members will maintain flying class III physicals.
        2.12.1.1. Non-CEA enlisted aircrew members require an aircrew prefix of X (Basic
        Aircrew), K (Instructor), or Q (Evaluator).
        2.12.1.2. Non-rated officer aircrew members may be assigned to duty positions with an
        AFSC prefix of X (Basic Aircrew), B (Squadron Operations Officer), C (Commander), F
        (Flight Test), K (Instructor), or Q (Evaluator).
            2.12.1.2.1. When a non-rated officer aircrew member and/or parachutist is assigned
            to an authorized X or J (Jump) prefixed UMD position which is also a Commander (C
            prefix) or a Squadron Operations Officer (B prefix) position, the C/B prefix does not
            remove the authorization to fly or jump. Place the following remark on the
            individual‘s AO: ―Member occupies an X (or J) prefix UMD position.‖
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                        73


         2.12.1.2.2. FSC J (Inactive) or L (TDY School) identifies aircrew members not
         assigned to active flying positions. AOs terminate authorization to fly and entitlement
         to incentive pay.
  2.12.2. FSC C (Operational Support) identifies non-rated/non-CEA personnel required to
  perform essential inflight duties that cannot be accomplished by rated officers, CEAs or non-
  rated aircrew members. Operational Support fliers may be required to perform flight duties
  on an occasional basis. However, their assigned full-time duties do not require them to be
  onboard the aircraft to accomplish its assigned primary mission. When the requirement to fly
  terminates, flight record responsibility ends. Authorized man-months are required prior to
  issuance of AOs. Process requests for operational support flying IAW AFI 11-402.
  2.12.3. Aerospace physiologists (DAFSC 43AX), Human Performance Training Teams
  (DAFSC 4M0X1), and non-aircrew aeromedical technicians (DAFSCs 42GX and 4N0XXs)
  are authorized to participate in aircraft flights as observers on a noninterference basis.
  HARM offices will publish AOs according to this instruction and MAJCOM directives.
  Neither ACIP entitlement nor OFDA credit are authorized. Personnel who provide high
  altitude airdrop mission support qualify for Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP).
  Paragraph 2.16.3through 2.16.5apply. Personnel who fly in support of high altitude airdrop
  missions will comply with AFI 11-402.
  2.12.3. (AETC) For detailed information regarding aerospace physiologists and human
  performance training teams (AP/HPTT), see paragraph A7.8 (Added).
  2.12.4. Other non-rated personnel who fly occasionally to perform specific tasks (e.g.,
  administrative duties, evaluation of equipment, maintenance, passenger escort, security for
  classified documents, crew chiefs who perform duties on the ground at the final destination
  or points enroute and other duties not authorized as operational support IAW AFI 11-402)
  may have AOs published according to this instruction and MAJCOM directives. Individuals
  in these categories will fly on a non-interference basis. Neither flying incentive pay nor
  OFDA credit is authorized. Paragraph 2.16.3and 2.16.5apply.
  2.12.4. (AETC) AETC wing-level and above CCMs are authorized to fly in this status to
  perform official observation of career enlisted aviator (CEA) instructor duties if their units or
  units subordinate to theirs have enlisted aircrew assigned, and those aircrew are actively
  flying unit assigned aircraft. These duties may be performed only locally on passenger-
  carrying capable aircraft (no point-to-point flights). The OG/CC with operational control of
  the aircraft must approve local flights at other than home station. The HARM office will use
  AF IMT 1887 to place members on noninterference orders. Do not issue aeronautical orders
  (AO) to CCMs for the convenience of transporting individuals in TDY status, or as a
  substitute for the orientation/familiarization flight program. AO termination dates for CCMs
  will not exceed the AF IMT 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special
  Operational Duty expiration, physiological training certification (where required) expiration ,
  or one year from the AO effective date (see Table A3.1, Item 19f, of the basic instruction),
  whichever occurs first. See AFI 48-123, for guidance on completing AF IMT 1042. The
  SARM office will establish currency folders for CCMs on current AOs. Folders will contain,
  at minimum, a copy of the AO, medical clearance certification, physiological training
  certification (where required), a record of aircrew flight equipment training, record of
74                                         AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


     emergency procedures, and aircraft systems training (where required). SARM office
     personnel will validate the currencies of all required training during go/no-go procedures.
        2.12.4.1. Members who fly on non-interference AOs will not be placed on the AFTO
        Form 781 (see Paragraph 1.6.2.2), except for those members specified in Paragraph
        3.3.1.5.2
        2.12.4.2. Non-Aircrew personnel who fly occasionally to obtain familiarity with the
        flying environment or directed to perform specific inflight duties on an infrequent or
        irregular basis (Commanders [including unit commanders], Operations Officers, and
        supervisory personnel) may do so under the guidelines of Paragraph 1.6. Non-aircrew
        members assigned to flying unit commander positions may log flying time IAW
        Paragraph 3.3.1.5.2.
        2.12.4.3. (Added-AETC) For detailed information regarding intelligence personnel
        flight program (IPFP), see paragraph A7.13 (Added).
     2.12.5. Aircrew members not formally entered into Initial Qualification Training will fly
     under orientation flight guidelines of Paragraph 1.9.4.7.
     2.12.6. Performance of flying duties is not authorized while on leave, permissive TDY, non-
     flying TDY, or participating in an orientation flight, unless individuals are required to
     perform their official aircrew duties.
     2.12.7. UAS sensor operators are authorized to participate in UAS aircraft flights as non-
     aircrew members. HARM offices will publish AOs according to this instruction and
     MAJCOM directives authorizing the performance of sensor operator duties. Neither HDIP
     entitlement nor OFDA credit are authorized. Non-aircrew members assigned to UAS sensor
     operator positions may log flying time IAW Paragraph 3.3.1.5.3.

Section 2B—Supervisory Operational Flying Positions

2.13. Supervisory Position Criteria. To conserve available resources, clearly identify rated
officers and CEA supervisory positions (API 6, 8, B, or D) that require the incumbent to actively
fly.
2.14. Supervisory Flying.
     2.14.1. Rated officer and CEA supervisory flying is necessary to ensure that appropriate
     rated staff officers maintain a current and comprehensive background in the overall flying
     operations of the organization. Although occasional indoctrination flights normally maintain
     inactive rated staff officers and career enlisted aviators at an acceptable level of experience
     for their jobs, it is Air Force policy that key supervisors must actively maintain their basic
     flying skills to provide them with expert awareness of the unit mission.
     2.14.1. (AETC) For information regarding AETC supervisory flyers (SF), see paragraph
     A7.9 (Added).
     2.14.2. Perform supervisory flying to the maximum extent possible in primary mission
     aircraft inventory (PMAI) associated with the position. When PMAI resources are not
     available or not practical to use, and maintenance of flying skills is mandatory, perform
     supervisory flying in the most cost-effective aircraft available.
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                   75


   2.14.3. Commanders (including unit commanders) authorized to designate rated and CEA
   supervisory positions must minimize the impact of such flying and designate API 6, 8, B, or
   D positions only when active flying is essential for mission accomplishment. Designating
   authorities are:
   2.14.3. (AETC) Coordinate all requests for changes to aircrew position indicators (API) 6,
   8, B, and D positions through HQ AETC/A3R to HQ AETC/A1M for approval.
       2.14.3.1. General Officer. The Chief of Staff designates general officer operational
       flying positions. MAJCOM commanders may manage assigned general officer
       operational flying positions above wing level to meet command requirements. Notify
       AF/A3/5 when a status change is made (send an info copy to AF/A3O-AT and AF/DPG).
       MAJCOMs are not authorized to increase the number of general officer operational fliers
       without the Chief of Staff‘s approval. MAJCOMs desiring to add operational fliers must
       submit a request for a change of status to AF/A3/5. AF/A3/5 will coordinate changes
       with AF/DPG. All requests for general officer operational flying training must be
       coordinated with AF/DPG. See paragraph 2.16.1 and Table 2.11 for additional
       guidance on general officer indoctrination fliers.

Table 2.10. General Officer Flying Positions.
The following general officer positions are authorized operational or indoctrination flying
positions (as shown) when filled by USAF general officers. Individuals flying operationally
must accomplish Form 8 qualification to include instrument qualification and must
maintain a minimum of BAQ status.

NOTES:
*1. Combatant Commanders may determine their flying status, based on requirements. Notify
AF/A3/5 of status, with info copy to AF/A3O-AT and AF/DPG.
*2. The Chief of Staff will determine the status of the AF/CC position.
*3. (Added) MAJCOMs may determine the flying status of general officers assigned within
their command, utilizing the available AF/CC-approved operational positions within the
command. This option applies to all approved operational flying positions above wing
commander. Current approved positions are shown in Table 2.10 with most recent HAF
authorized status (NOTE: May not reflect actual status if a MAJCOM change has been made). If
a change is made, notify AF/A3/5 with an info copy to AF/A3O-AT and AF/DPG.
*4. (Added) Wing Commander applies to commanders of flying wings (and includes
expeditionary flying wings). Air base and support wing commanders are specifically excluded.
*5. (Added) Current list of approved general officer operational flying positions is maintained
on file in AF/A3O-AT. AF/A3O-AT maintains records of approval for all general officer
operational flying positions.
*6. (Added) Individuals (O-6) in currently authorized operational flying positions who have
been selected for promotion to the grade of Brigadier General may continue to fly operationally
while assigned to their current flying position.
       2.14.3.2. Colonel. MAJCOMs designate colonel active flying positions (API 6/8) by
       forwarding AF Form 480,Aircrew AFSC/Active Flying Justification, to AF/DPO for
       review and approval (see AFI 38-201,Determining Manpower Requirements). Colonel
       flying positions will be limited to individuals who directly supervise aircraft flying
       operations, flight safety, standardization/evaluation programs, and operational readiness
       inspection programs. Should positions not warrant full time flying, there may be
       justification for the individual to participate in the indoctrination flying program.
       2.14.3.3. Lieutenant Colonel and Below. MAJCOMs designate Lt Colonel-and-below
       rated officer and CEA positions that require active flying IAW AFI 38-201. If the
       position requires an AF Form 480, provide justification for flying on the form. Normally,
       API 8/D positions (NAF/FOA/DRU/MAJCOM) are authorized only in safety, inspector
       general, and standardization/evaluation functional areas in which flying is a requirement
       associated with the position. On occasion, justification may exist for an aircrew member
       to fly while in inactive status; see Paragraph 2.17.
2.15. Supervisory Position Limitations. MAJCOMs will establish procedures to review API
6, 8, B, and D supervisory flying positions when incumbents are assigned FSC K (lack of
support) and when adequate support will not be available within six months. Where practical,
convert such positions to API 3, 4, C or E.
2.16. Indoctrination Flying. Rated officers and CEAs in inactive status who are required to
perform operational flying on a temporary basis to complete a specific official task (for example,
to evaluate an operational flying procedure, review flying training effectiveness, take part in a
78                                        AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


flying exercise or test program, or become familiar with a specific operational weapon system
and procedure) may be authorized indoctrination flying status. The following policy applies:
     2.16.1. MAJCOMs (or MAJCOM equivalents) select and authorize rated staff and CEA
     positions for indoctrination flying. Indoctrination flying allows inflight observations of
     mission equipment or procedures that will benefit the organization. Incumbents must request
     to fly. Take a conservative approach in designating these positions. MAJCOMs (or
     MAJCOM equivalents) will establish procedures for approval of indoctrination flying in
     accordance with Table 2.11 MAJCOMs will identify the incumbent by assigning FSC T.
     MAJCOMs may not increase the number of general officer indoctrination fliers without
     AF/CC approval.
     2.16.1. (AETC) For detailed information regarding indoctrination flyers (IF), see paragraph
     A7.10 (Added).
     2.16.2. MAJCOM commanders must approve the use of command aircraft resources to
     support indoctrination flying for personnel outside their commands. Authorization may be
     delegated, but not lower than MAJCOM level.
     2.16.3. MAJCOMs must ensure individuals complete, before flight, adequate training on
     emergency procedures, life support equipment, and aircraft systems. Individuals must be
     physically and, where required, physiologically qualified.
     2.16.4. Indoctrination flights in inactive status do not entitle the member to OFDA credit or
     incentive pay and do not allow authority to change ASCs except to assign FSC T.
     MAJCOMs will ensure indoctrination flying does not impact unit training, and will not
     increase command flying hour allocations.
     2.16.5. Obtaining or maintaining aircraft qualification while in inactive status is not
     authorized. Individuals flying in inactive status may not act as pilot in command and flights
     in single-place aircraft are specifically prohibited. Document indoctrination flights on the
     AFTO Form 781,ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Documentusing Other flight time, IAW
     Paragraph 3.4.5
     2.16.6. (Added) MAJCOMs may authorize indoctrination flying for individuals assigned to
     active operational flying positions. Do not change FSC.
     2.16.7. (Added) Indoctrination flying is not authorized for individuals assigned to API 0 or
     Z coded positions. EXCEPTION: MAJCOMs may authorize indoctrination flying for CEAs
     assigned to 9G100 positions, and for individuals tasked to perform indoctrination flying
     duties while deployed.

Section 2C—Flight Management Administration

2.17. Host Aviation Resource Management Office. The host command of the Air Force base
designates within the operations group a HARM office function to be the base OPR for ARMS
and for FRF/JRF management of all aircrew/parachutists on base or in the locale (regardless of
MAJCOM). (EXCEPTION: For ANG units not associated with active duty units, the ANG
Wing/GSU Commander will appoint an ANG HARM office for management of ANG flight
records.) The Wing/Group HARM Chief will be the senior or most qualified person, with a
primary AFSC of 1C072, 1C092, 1C000, or civilian equivalent. The individual appointed to this
position will have a minimum of three years experience in the Aviation Resource Management
career field, and obtained/maintained Special Experience Identifier (066). (Waiver requests to
these qualification requirements must be submitted to the MAJCOM functional manager with
documentation of member‘s qualification [copy of 1C0X2 training record documenting AO task
certification], and expected get well date.) HARM offices will be manned according to Air Force
Manpower Standard (AFMS) 13C1, OFPP Policy Letter 92-1, and the Defense Reform Initiative
Directive (DRID) 20. (EXCEPTION: Air National Guard Wing/Group HARM offices will be
manned IAW NGB/OL manpower standards for specific MDS or mission.) HARM positions are
inherently governmental and only qualified 1C0X2 personnel (and government equivalent) will
operate ARMS for the purpose of processing aviation/parachutist service entitlement actions, or
monitoring and validating entitlement to flight/parachutist incentive pay.
   2.17.1. Prepare AOs according to Attachment 3of this instruction and AFI 11-402.
   2.17.2. Maintain all FRFs/JRFs according to this instruction, AFI 11-410,Personnel
   Parachute Operations, AFI 11-421,Aviation Resource Management, AFPD 33-3,Information

   accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), located
   athttps://afrims.amc.af.mil. Maintain all FRFs/JRFs at the HARM office nearest to where
   the aircrew member maintains personnel, finance, and if possible, medical records.
   (EXCEPTION: All inactive IMA FRFs/JRFs will be maintained by AFRC/RMG.) To ensure
   proper aviation or parachutist incentive pay validation and prevent interruptions in the
   MilPDS to ARMS interface, FRF/JRF management will not change for TDY periods of less
   than 90 days. For formal courses where the member will accomplish flight/jump activity,
   provide to the TDY unit a TDY/Formal Flying Processing Checklist and ARMS training
80                                         AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


     products IAW AFI 11-421. If the member‘s personnel and finance records are maintained at
     different locations, the HARM office located nearest to where the finance records are
     maintained will manage the member‘s FRF. With the concurrence of both HARM offices
     (and MAJCOMs if different), and with MOAs in place, FRFs of attached flyers may be kept
     at the attached HARM office. Request exceptions to this policy from AF/A3O-AT.
     2.17.3. Obtain medical information from the FME. The FME will provide the initial
     notification to the HARM office when required periodic physical examinations are
     completed, or when there are changes to an individual‘s medical status that affect flying duty.
     Suspense is one duty day.
        2.17.3.1. (DELETED) .
        2.17.3.2. The FME will send completed medical examination results (AF Form
        1042,Medical Recommendations for Flying or Special Operational Duty) to the HARM
        office within 10 duty-days. If the medical examination is incomplete due to reasons
        beyond the member"s control, the appropriate medical waiver authority may extend
        certification to cover administrative processing. The FME will inform the HARM office
        via AF Form 1042 if the applicable waiver authority extends an aircrew member‘s
        medical certification. The official date of the AF Form 1042 will be the date of the flight
        surgeon‘s signature. See also AFI 11-402.
     2.17.4. Validate entitlement to flying/jump incentive pays with member‘s finance office. The
     HARM office will ensure receipt of documentation required to validate accurate flight/jump
     pay entitlement, to include verification that the member is receiving the correct rate of
     incentive pay.
     2.17.5. Validate personnel data changes with member‘s unit orderly room. Contact the MPF
     to obtain a UMD and a personnel listing to reflect member‘s current assignment data. As a
     minimum, validate DAFSC, API, effective date of duty, unit manning position numbers, and
     active Guard/Reserve duty (AGR) or non-EAD status for ARC personnel.
     2.17.6. Monitor and ensure the proper FAC and ASC are assigned for all assigned and
     attached fliers.

2.20. Attachment for Flying/Parachuting.
2.20. (AETC) Attachment for Flying/Parachuting. Records for members on active
flight/jump status permanently assigned to a base and attached to another to perform such duties
will be maintained at the attached HARM office. Exception: FRF/JRFs for general officers and
stan/eval assigned to HQ AETC or 19 AF will be maintained at Randolph AFB.
     2.20.1. Aircrew/parachutist members assigned by PCS/PCA orders to active
     flying/parachutist positions in US Air Force units and organizations without flying facilities
     or aircraft may be attached for flying/parachuting to units with appropriate resources. Intra-
     wing attachments may be approved by the OG/CC. Individuals must request (in writing)
     attachment for flying/jumping through their chain of command to their MAJCOM or
     equivalent. (EXCEPTION: Request for attachment for flying/parachuting is not required if
     flying/parachuting support and a primary unit/aircraft is addressed in a host-tenant
     agreement. Members will provide required information to the servicing HARM office.)
     Approval authority may be delegated as directed by MAJCOMs. The request must include:
     Individual‘s name, rank, Social Security Number (SSN), aviation service date (ASD),
     aviation service code (ASC), aeronautical rating (or badge), expected duration of attachment,
     date of separation (DOS)/expiration of term of service (ETS), assigned duty position
     title/position number/API code, aircraft last qualified in, date last flown, current AO, current
     AF Form 1042, and requested unit of attachment and point of contact. (Parachutists need
     only provide information applicable to parachuting.) Individuals should coordinate
     flying/parachute qualification, currency and attachment with requested units prior to
     submitting formal request. MAJCOMs will develop procedures for attachments within the
     MAJCOM. For attachments outside an individual‘s MAJCOM, submit the request to both
     MAJCOMs (or equivalent) for coordination. For attachments outside the USAF, submit the
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                       83


  request to the gaining unit‘s MAJCOM equivalent approval authority and the individual‘s
  parent MAJCOM (or equivalent) approval authority for coordination.
  2.20.1. (AETC) Exception: Aircrew members attached to flying units within the same
  wing or group and located on the same base do not require memorandums requesting
  attachment. Example: An individual assigned to the group stan/eval function and attached to
  a local squadron for flying, or flight surgeons assigned to local medical group (same wing,
  same base).
     2.20.1.1. (Added-AETC) The NAF/CC is the approval authority for flying and
     parachuting attachment within AETC. Forward approval requests for flyer and
     parachutist attachment (including supporting rationale) through wing channels to
     NAF/DO for NAF/CC approval. See Attachment 10 (Added) for AETC instructions on
     requesting an attachment for flying.
     2.20.1.2. (Added-AETC) For units with a host tenant agreement, approval authority for
     attached flyers is delegated to the OG/CC with operational direction. Tenant units
     authorized to be attached to a host unit will provide a roster of attached flyers to the host
     unit OG/CC. The host unit will forward a copy of the roster to the servicing HARM
     office, NAF/DO, and HQ AETC/A3F. AETC units will coordinate new and revised host
     tenant support agreements with the NAF/DO and HQ AETC/A3F when they establish
     attachment for flying to an AETC flying or jump unit.
     2.20.1.3. (Added-AETC) AETC/A2/3/10 is the approval authority for attached aircrew
     members from other commands who will instruct AETC students (paragraph 1.10.1.10
     (Added)). Use the format in Attachment 10 (Added), and include justification for AETC
     instructor approval. Exception: The 306 FTG/CC is the approval authority for USAFA-
     assigned instructors in Airmanship programs.
     2.20.1.4. (Added-AETC) The attached flyer must contribute to the AETC or local
     mission in a tangible, positive manner. HQ AETC (through the wing or group
     commander or above) retains the right to terminate support of attached flyers when this
     support begins to have a negative impact on AETC personnel and mission. The SQ/CC
     will ensure attached instructors are FTU instructor certified prior to flight with
     unqualified students. Previously certified FTU instructors are not required to undergo the
     local faculty training course a second time. On completion of assignment, the member‘s
     attached flying authorization will be rescinded. The HARM will notify NAF/DOO within
     30 days of the rescinded flying authorization.
     2.20.1.5. (Added-AETC) Attachment authority for NAF crewmembers is delegated to
     NAF/DO for attachment to flying units under NAF control. The NAF attachment
     memorandum will contain the same requirements as listed in the basic instruction,
     paragraph 2.20.1, and will be signed by NAF/DO. The NAF/DO will send the attachment
     for flying memorandum to the appropriate HARM and the unit of attachment.
  2.20.2. Attachment units will provide resources necessary for the member to complete and
  maintain minimum training requirements established in applicable aircrew/parachutist
  training publications, including TDY cost to formal training courses. The unit to which the
  member is assigned is responsible for cost of the member‘s TDY travel to the attached unit to
  accomplish normal training requirements. The attached unit will maintain the FEF.

     2.22.2. Inter-Fly. AFRC operations group commanders are authorized to approve flights
     with AFRC units for aircrew members not assigned or attached to an AFRC unit and are the
     final authority for determining when an active duty/air national guard member may fly unit
     aircraft. Such aircrew members must provide operations group commanders with a source
     for validating aircrew qualifications, training and currencies prior to flying. AFRC OG/CCs
     will forward information copies of interfly agreements to the respective NAF/A3.
     EXCEPTION: Those units with an existing written agreement, e.g. TFI/associate units, will
     follow guidance within the agreement.
        2.22.2.1. (Added) Interfly agreements may involve the exchange and/or substitution of
        aircrew members and/or aircraft between different MAJCOM units to accomplish flying
        in support of contingencies, exercises or designated missions according to the appropriate
        OPLAN/CONOPS.
        2.22.2.2. (Added) During situations where interfly may be an option, aircraft ownership
        does not change. Aircraft hours executed will be credited to the command and unit of
        assignment of the aircraft regardless of the crews MAJCOM affiliation. Ensure use of
        correct mission symbol.
            2.22.2.2.1. (Added) For TFI units, there are two separate and distinctly funded
            flying hour programs. Unit ‗owning aircraft‘ has responsibility for oversight and
            management of both programs in tandem. TFI and Associate units are to use their
            respective command‘s mission symbols regardless of crew status
            (Active/ANG/Reserve).
        2.22.2.3. (Added) As a minimum, interfly crewmembers will be qualified/certified in
        the MDS and model as well as system/configuration required to fly the aircraft and/or
        mission.

2.23. Flying With ANG Units.
   2.23.1. The ANG Wing Commander must concur on all active duty flying with ANG units.
   Flying is restricted to Air Force advisors and aircrews who support unit training objectives,
   contingencies, or operational missions to include aircrew that inspect, standardize, augment,
   or assist in unit conversion. (Individuals will not be listed on the ANG web page since they
   are not formally attached to an ANG unit for the purpose of obtaining continuation training.)
   With the deployed commander‘s concurrence, active duty aircrew attached to Air Warrior,
   Combat Archer and Combat Hammer are authorized to fly with ANG units.
   2.23.2. Active duty flying with ANG units for the sole purpose of continuation training (CT)
   is prohibited without approval from the ANG Director of Operations (NGB/A3). (Future
   Total Force [FTF] wings will coordinate active duty CT flying IAW the MAJCOM
   CONOPS). Forward all requests for active duty CT flying support to NGB/A3 with
   appropriate ANG Wing Commander and MAJCOM/A3 concurrence. Requests must include:
   name, rank, office symbol (e.g., 9 AF/DOV), primary aircraft MDS (e.g., F-16C, C-130E),
   aircrew position (e.g., IP, IN), and reason for requested CT support. A complete list of AD
   aircrew approved to fly CT sorties with the ANG is available on the NGB/A3O Portal.
   2.23.3. Active duty aircrew members authorized to fly ANG aircraft in accordance with
   Paragraph 2.22.2may coordinate sortie support directly with the unit. Members must
   provide the supporting unit operations group commander with a source for verifying
   currencies, egress training, flight qualification, etc., before flying. The supporting unit
   operations group commander is the final authority for determining when active duty aircrew
   may fly unit aircraft.
   2.23.4. Conduct flying in accordance with applicable US Air Force, lead MAJCOM, and
   ANG instructions.
2.24. Coordination Authorization. Direct communication with MAJCOMs, AFRC, and ANG
concerning attachment of rated personnel is authorized.

     3.1.1. Use these records as the basis for USAF flying resource inventory reporting (RCS:
     HAF-A3O[M&AR]0701). This report provides essential individual flying information to HQ
     USAF and MAJCOMs. HARM offices ensure the report is transmitted not later than the 10th
     of each month (or as soon as possible for special reports). Continue to report during
     emergency conditions, precedence delayed (Emergency Status Code C-3). Continue
     reporting during MINIMIZE.
     3.1.2. The HARM office is the sole approval authority (except for HQ USAF/A3OT) at each
     flying base for entitlement to and the initiation and termination of Aviation Career Incentive
     Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted Flyer Incentive Pay (CEFIP), and Hazardous Duty Incentive
     Pay (HDIP) for flying and parachute duties. The HARM office interprets public law as it
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                     87


  pertains to flying/jumping incentive pays; audits, reconciles, and processes associated waiver
  requests; is the single point of contact for ARMS; and is responsible for the following
  procedures:
     3.1.2.1. The HARM office, maintains FRFs/JRFs for all flying (active and inactive) and
     jump personnel with the assigned HARM code established for that base. The ARMS
     program manager will allocate one ARMS database code per base. (EXCEPTION: The
     ARMS program manager may allocate more than one ARMS database code for
     installations granted an exception IAW Paragraph 2.17of this instruction.) The HARM
     office must be located in a securable area to ensure integrity of Privacy Act material
     when office personnel are not present.
     3.1.2.1. (AETC) Following UFT, the HARM office must file, on the right side of the
     FRF, an AETC Form 240-5, Summary Record of Training; a TIMS-created product; or a
     locally developed and approved form used to verify time, with source-related documents,
     and update the student time in ARMS.
         3.1.2.1.1. Base HARM offices keep the FRFs/JRFs for all assigned tenant and
         attached personnel ordered to take part in regular and frequent flights as aircrew,
         operational support members, and parachutists. This includes all active duty and ARC
         active and inactive aircrew members, active operational support members, and
         parachutists. (EXCEPTION: HARM offices will not create/maintain FRFs or JRFs
         for UNRAPPs.)
         3.1.2.1.2. Base HARM offices will combine the FRF and JRF into one folder for dual
         qualified aircrew and parachutist members. File documents IAW AFI 11-421.
         3.1.2.1.3. Base HARM offices will maintain FRFs/JRFs for disqualified aircrew or
         parachutists (entitlement status 0) for eight years after such designation. After eight
         consecutive years, return the FRF/JRF to the member. (EXCEPTION:for UFT
         students disqualified from training and operational support fliers removed from flying
         for more than one year, release the FRF to the member and comply with out-
         processing guidance in AFI 11-421.)
  3.1.3. Initiate a Military Pay Order (MPO) (except for non-USAF members) NLT 5 work
  days when:
     3.1.3.1. An aircrew/parachutist member initially meets or fails to meet flight/jump
     entitlement requirements for pay.
     3.1.3.2. An aircrew/parachutist member satisfies flight/jump entitlement requirements
     for pay following a period of failure to meet minimum requirements (or a period of
     suspension disqualification has been removed), or a member otherwise regains
     entitlement to incentive pay.
     3.1.3.3. An individual in conditional entitlement status (ESC 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, E, F, G, or H)
     departs PCS to a non-flying or non-jump position.
     3.1.3.4. A parachutist enters into a 12-month Rule 3 waiver period IAW DODFMR and
     AFI 11-421,Aviation Resource Management. The HARM office will terminate pay until
     jump requirements are met.
  3.1.4. Release the FRF to individual custody only after the HARM office receives:
88                                         AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


        3.1.4.1. Official PCS orders or TDY orders indicating a TDY with another USAF
        activity for a period of 90 days or more (ref. Paragraph 1.5.4). (Units have the option to
        transfer records to the gaining HARM office for TDYs.)
            3.1.4.1.1. (Added-AETC) Do not release the FRF/JRF for TDY to non-flying
            contingency taskings. Do not release FRF/JRF to individuals in suspended (ASC 04)
            aviation service status.
            3.1.4.1.2. (Added-AETC) WG/CCs, OG/CCs, SQ/CCs and inspection team
            members may temporarily sign out FRFs to perform official duties. The HARM must
            have on file a memo signed by the SQ/CC designating individuals authorized to
            pickup FRFs.
        3.1.4.2. Official retirement or separation orders.
        3.1.4.3. Notice that the aircrew member has been disqualified for more than eight
        consecutive years. (See Paragraph 3.1.2.1.3for one-year release.)
     3.1.5. Release of Data from Flight/Jump Records.
        3.1.5.1. Information maintained in the FRF/JRF is subject to the provisions of the
        Privacy Act of 1974. HARM offices have a legal obligation to safeguard these records
        from unlawful disclosure. Standard ARMS reports or ad hoc queries which contain
        personal data will have the symbol "(PA)" in the product title and contain the statement
        "Personal Data - Privacy Act of 1974."
        3.1.5.2. The disclosure of information, for any purpose, to other than those AF activities
        with an official need, is not authorized without the expressed written consent of the
        member concerned.
        3.1.5.3. Except where allowed by law, do not disclose data to agencies outside the
        Department of Defense. Reference AFI 33-332,Privacy Act Program.Maintain a record
        of each disclosure to include name and address of the person or agency receiving the
        data, date, nature and purpose of each disclosure.
            3.1.5.3.1. Retain a copy of the disclosure on file as part of the FRF/JRF. Prior to
            releasing the FRF/JRF, the HARM office will remove all records disclosures. Retain
            the disclosure accounting on file for five years or for the life of the record, whichever
            is longer.
        3.1.5.4. The Pilot Records Improvement Act of 1996 requires that before a civilian
        airline hires a pilot, the air carrier must request and receive certain records from "any
        carrier or other persons that have employed the individual at any time during the
        preceding five years." Before any information is released to an agency based on this Act,
        HARM offices must receive a written release of information statement signed by the
        applicant via the agency or applicant. This statement confirms the applicant agrees to the
        release of records to the air carrier. The HARM office will not release any information
        without receipt of this signed statement. HARM offices must release information within
        30 days of receipt of the request. Additionally, the releaser must provide notice to the
        applicant that a release request has been received and inform the applicant of his or her
        right to receive a copy of the records. The HARM office will provide the Individual
        Flight Record (IFR), Flying History Report (FHR), and documents contained in the
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                       89


       member‘s Flying Evaluation Folder (FEF) for the preceding five years from the date of
       employment application of the member. If the member‘s FEF is maintained in another
       location, the HARM office must obtain and provide copies to the requesting agency.
   3.1.6. The FRFs/JRFs of personnel assigned or attached to other than USAF activities must
   be kept at a designated HARM office. The following guidance applies:
       3.1.6.1. The parent command will designate a HARM office to maintain FRFs/JRFs for
       individual aircrew members or parachutists on duty with other US military services.
       3.1.6.2. The MAJCOM with geographical cognizance over the area or country to which
       the individual is assigned or attached for duty with an allied service or on duty with non-
       US military agencies will designate a HARM office to maintain the FRF/JRF.
       3.1.6.3. If the individual‘s FRF/JRF is required at the crewmember‘s or parachutist‘s
       duty station, provide a duplicate copy. The master record will be kept at the HARM
       office designated by the MAJCOM.
       3.1.6.4. The designated HARM office will notify the member‘s parent MAJCOM if the
       member will exceed 180 days in FSC ―S‖ or FSC ―4‖ status. Notify the MAJCOM prior
       to the member exceeding the 180-day limit. See also Paragraph 1.4.1.8

Section 3B—Logging of Flight Activity (ARMS)

3.2. Background Information. This section explains the conditions under which personnel are
authorized to log flight activity into ARMS. ARMS will be used for tracking and management of
all aircrew and operational support flight activity. NOTE: 306 OSS/OSOF (USAFA HARM)
will assign military DoD/UNRAPP training requirements in the ARMS training database to those
who obtain a qualification through completion of 306 FTG airmanship programs.
   3.2.1. The Air Force flying program is designed to ensure that each individual actively
   engaged in performing airborne duties maintains basic professional skills. This requires
   accurately logged flight and simulator activity to record and monitor flying experience.
   3.2.2. Flight data must be recorded and reported accurately to provide commanders with
   meaningful flight experience information to ensure resources are effectively used and only
   qualified personnel receive incentive pay. Units will follow AFI 33-360,Publications and
   Forms Management,to develop local training accomplishment forms for entering training
   data into ARMS.
   3.2.2. (AETC) See AFI 11-202, Volume 1, for guidance on training accomplishment forms.
   Exception: If AFTO Form 781 flight time is .0 (1 to 2 minutes) and training events are
   logged on the training accomplishment report, place a remark on the back of the form to
   explain events accomplished.
   3.2.3. Responsibility of Pilot in Command. Enter and credit flight time on an individual"s
   flight record only when flown according to this instruction and properly logged on AFTO
   Form 781 or AF Form 3250. The pilot designated, as "in command" of the aircraft is
   responsible for making sure the appropriate form is dated and properly completed, to include
   specific remarks as required. These forms provide an accurate record of pertinent flight data
   for personnel authorized to take part in the flight and to receive ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP.

     3.2.4. (Added-AETC) Rated Air Force members will document their flight time on AF
     IMT 3520 when flying joint fixed-wing training at Corpus Christi Naval Air Station (NAS)
     TX; Whiting NAS FL; and Pensacola NAS FL. Submit the completed AF IMT 3520 to the
     appropriate HARM office within 5 duty days of the flight to prevent the member from being
     placed in FSC S, which stops flying gate months from accumulating.
3.3. Crediting Flight Time. Credit flying time as follows:
3.3. (AETC) Crediting Flight Time. The secondary flight time category includes all multitask
trainers, operational flight trainers (OFT), weapon systems trainers (WST), and part-task trainers
(PTT) except the special function trainer.
     3.3.1. To credit flight activity, personnel must:
        3.3.1.1. Be physically qualified. The member cannot be in DNIF status and must be
        medically cleared for flying duty, documented on an AF Form 1042.
        3.3.1.2. Be physiologically qualified (if applicable for the aircraft).
        3.3.1.3. Be on AOs to take part in frequent and regular flights as aircrew, to obtain
        aircrew qualification, or as operational support members (IAW AFI 11-402).
        3.3.1.4. Be under an approved aircrew qualification code (based on AF Form 8/8a
        qualification) and aircrew position identifier ( Table A2.3) designated on the flight
        authorization for the aircraft. ( EXCEPTION: aircrew members authorized to perform
        inflight duties in non-USAF aircraft, IAW Paragraph 1.11, will comply with guidance
        applicable to the authority controlling the aircraft in regards to flight authorization
        requirements.)
        3.3.1.5. Be part of the crew complement (AFI 65-503) authorized to perform aircrew
        duties in the aircraft in order to obtain and maintain aircrew qualification, or be required
        for the mission.
            3.3.1.5.1. Individuals required for the mission who are not part of the crew
            complement may log flying time only when specifically authorized to perform duties
            required for the mission (e.g. AEs, CROs, PJs, combat camera, etc), or when
            specifically authorized to perform mission-related observation or evaluation duties.
            Members will comply with all other applicable requirements to include medical
            clearance and physiological training (if applicable).
                3.3.1.5.1.1. (Added) Commanders will include an explanatory note in the
                remarks section of the FA for crewmembers that exceed the crew complement but
                are required for the mission.
            3.3.1.5.2. Non-aircrew members assigned to flying unit commander positions may
            log flying time in assigned aircraft. Individuals will fly on a non-interference basis
            (reference Paragraph 2.12.4), will use crew position "OX" (Colonel and above) or
            "XX" (Lt Col and below) IAW Table A2.3, and will log other time on the AFTO
            Form 781 for entry into ARMS.
            3.3.1.5.3. Non-aircrew members assigned to UAS sensor operator positions will log
            flying time in assigned UAS aircraft. Individuals will fly on a non-interference basis
            (reference Paragraph 2.12.7), will use aircrew position (Second Character) "X" IAW
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                       91


          Table A2.3, and will log AFTO Form 781 flying time category commensurate with
          qualification and duties performed for entry into ARMS.
   3.3.2. Flights in any other capacity are orientation flights IAW Paragraph 1.9.4.7.1and
   logging flight time on an AFTO Form 781 is not authorized. Commanders will ensure
   crewmembers and parachutists do not credit flights/jumps while on leave, permissive TDY,
   or nonflying/nonjumping TDY/Temporary Assignment Duty (TAD), regardless of duration,
   or while flying on an aircraft during point-to-point travel (not authorized or required to
   perform aircrew duties). Aircrew members will not log flying time when the purpose for
   flying is to make a proficiency-sustaining jump or perform jumpmaster duties.
   EXCEPTION: Pararescue personnel in "X" coded billets may log flying time if aircrew
   duties are performed during the flying portion of the mission. Document duties performed in
   the remarks section of the AFTO Form 781.
   3.3.3. For individuals authorized to perform inflight duties in non-US Air Force aircraft,
   reference Paragraph 1.11, Paragraph 3.3.1.4, above, does not apply. IAW Paragraph
   3.3.1.5, individuals must be required for the mission.
3.4. Definition of Flight Time Categories. The references in this paragraph to aircraft also
apply to synthetic training devices categorized as operational flying trainers or weapon system
trainers. Log flight time only on the AFTO Form 781 and AF Form 3520,ARMS Aircrew/Mission
Flight Data Extract, and use only the approved Flight Authorization Duty Codes listed in
Attachment 2, Table A2.3.
   3.4.1. Primary Flight Time. Time logged by a member occupying a designated duty
   station identified in AFI 65-503, and actively performing the duty associated with their
   aircrew specialty. Only qualified aircrew members and aircrew members obtaining
   qualification in the aircraft will log primary time when performing in-flight duties. Non-rated
   aircrew members and operational support personnel who do not have an established crew
   duty station will log primary time only when actually performing required in-flight duty. For
   example: operating equipment or caring for medical evacuation patients.
       3.4.1.1. EXCEPTIONS:
          3.4.1.1.1. Pilot commanders and key supervisors who fly IAW the provisions of
          Paragraph 3.7.1will log primary time only when actually controlling the aircraft.
          3.4.1.1.2. Pilots who maintain qualification in single-place aircraft when completing
          instrument training or the instrument flight check in similar dual-place aircraft.
          3.4.1.1.3. Graduates of a military test pilot school (Air Force Test Pilot School, Navy
          Test Pilot School, etc.) are considered qualified and may log primary flight time using
          FP, FN, or FW as the flight authorization duty code while actively flying qualitative
          or approved short-term aircraft tests or evaluations. This does not authorize Test Pilot
          School graduates to perform duties on other missions requiring qualified aircrew
          members at the controls of the aircraft (e.g. functional check flights).
          3.4.1.1.4. Pararescue/Combat Rescue Officer aircrew members assigned to
          authorized flying billets, on active flying AOs and qualified in the MDS, who are
          required in addition to the normal aircrew complement to perform in-flight duties for
          mass rescued aircrew member/personnel missions may log primary flight time when

        performing patient support duties on mass personnel recovery missions. Primary time
        is authorized only during the time required in-flight duties are performed. During
        periods when the PJ is not performing in-flight duties associated with the rescued
        members, or if the PJ is non-current for that MDS, "Other" flight time will be logged.
        Annotate specific inflight duties that require additional crewmembers (in additional to
        basic crew complement) on the mission in the remarks section of the AFTO Form
        781.
        3.4.1.1.5. (Added) Operational support medical personnel may log primary time
        when tasked to perform primary medical support duties on real world Combat Search
        and Rescue (CSAR), Casualty Evacuation (CASEVAC) or Medical Evacuation
        (MEDEVAC) missions. If tasked to fly on sister service CSAR, CASEVAC, or
        MEDEVAC missions, ensure requests are coordinated though the member"s
        MAJCOM IAW Paragraph 1.11.1of this instruction.
        3.4.1.1.6. (Added) Aeromedical        Evacuation      Crewmembers        (AECM)      on
        Aeromedical Readiness Missions (ARM) are authorized to conduct simultaneous
        (tandem) training on the same aircraft utilizing no more than two basic AE crews to
        meet flight currency requirements. AECMs in primary crew positions will log
        primary time when performing in-flight duties. Example: Two basic AE crews
        conducting separate in-flight training using separate in-flight kits, medical equipment,
        and mission documentation. A lead crew will be identified to the flight crew prior to
        take off for CRM purposes.
        3.4.1.1.7. (Added-AETC) Pilot/physicians are authorized to log FS time when not
        actively performing pilot duties. Document duties performed in both specialties in the
        remarks section of AFTO Form 781.
     3.4.1.2. For pilots, primary time is time actively controlling the aircraft, excluding
     hands-on-time flown while instructing and evaluating (log such time under instructor or
     evaluator). It is not predicated on which set of controls is being used (multi-place
     aircraft), or on the duty position indicated on the flight authorization. Pilots receiving
     instruction while controlling the aircraft will log primary time
     3.4.1.3. Astronauts performing duties in the space shuttle may log primary time in their
     rated specialty in accordance with the preceding paragraphs. Astronauts performing space
     station duties may log primary time for the duration of space station activity. For space
     station duty, use Aircrew Position Identifier (Second Character) "A" from Attachment 2,
     Table A2.3.
     3.4.1.4. For other aircrew specialties, log primary flight time only when performing
     duties at a duty position established for that specialty. Where more than one station is
     established for the same specialty, one member at each such station may log primary time
     while actually performing the duties associated with that station (for example, multiple
     Air Surveillance Operator positions on a single aircraft). (MAJCOMs will specify which
     AFI 65-503,US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, authorized crew duty station(s)
     flight test engineers may occupy during test functions. During periods when the flight test
     engineer is not actively performing his or her evaluation/test duties, Other time will be
     logged.) Except under conditions in this paragraph, the total primary time for any specific
     aircrew specialty will not exceed the total flight time.
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                       93


     3.4.1.5. Nonrated aircrew members on active flying AOs, qualified in specific aircraft,
     but tasked to perform in-flight aircrew duties for a time-sensitive mission in an aircraft in
     which they are not current and/or not qualified, will log aircrew certification code (first
     character of crew position) "F" and primary time for that mission. See also Paragraph
     3.3.1.5.1
  3.4.2. Secondary Flight Time. Flight time logged by a crewmember who is performing
  inflight duties related to the crewmember‘s specialty, but who is not controlling the function
  of that specialty. Except as listed below, the total secondary time logged in each specialty
  will not exceed the total flight time. When crewmembers are in excess of the authorized crew
  complement, annotate in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781 the secondary duties performed
  by additional aircrew.
     3.4.2.1. The member must be maintaining or obtaining qualification in the aircraft to log
     secondary time. EXCEPTION: Crewmembers in aircrew positions designated in AFI 65-
     503; and tasked to perform primary duties on aircraft other than their assigned aircraft
     (e.g., Flight Attendants tasked by TACC or HHQ to support Silver Bullet or DV
     missions) will log secondary time as long as they maintain currency in their primary
     aircraft. The member‘s aircrew certification code will reflect the current qualification. If
     not qualified in the aircraft, the member will log ―X‖ or ―O‖ as the aircrew qualification
     code first character IAW Table A2.3.
     3.4.2.2. For pilots, log secondary time while occupying a duty position having a set of
     flight controls and not actively controlling the aircraft, instructing, or evaluating.
     3.4.2.3. For other aircrew specialties, log secondary time when actually performing
     inflight duties of the specialty, but not at the primary duty station established for that
     specialty (for example, second navigator during airdrop missions or additional PJs/CROs
     on AOs required to perform "in-flight duties" assisting mass aircrew/personnel on a
     rescue mission) when dictated by mission requirements.
         3.4.2.3.1. Annotate in the remarks section of the AFTO Form 781 specific inflight
         duties performed and circumstances that require additional crewmembers (in
         additional to basic crew complement) to perform the mission.
     3.4.2.4. A current Aeromedical Evacuation Crewmember (AECM) may log secondary
     time when performing simulated patient duties or Mission Clinical Coordinator duties
     during aeromedical readiness missions. A noncurrent AECM may only log Other flight
     time when performing simulated patient duties
     3.4.2.5. Except as provided for in AFI 65-503, the total secondary time logged in each
     specialty will not exceed the total flight time.
     3.4.2.6. Pararescue aircrew members assigned to authorized flying billets, on active
     flying AOs and qualified in the MDS, who are required in addition to the normal aircrew
     complement to perform in-flight duties for mass rescued aircrew member/personnel
     missions, may log secondary time when performing simulated patient duties or Mission
     Coordinator duties on mass personnel recovery training missions. Secondary time is
     authorized only during such time those in-flight duties are performed. During periods
     when the PJ is not performing "in-flight" duties associated with the rescued members or
     mission coordinator, or non-current for that MDS, only Other flight time will be logged.
94                                          AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


     3.4.3. Instructor Flight Time. Flight time logged by a designated and qualified instructor
     while actively performing authorized instructional duties. Includes "hands on" time during
     demonstration activities that are part of instructional duties. The instructor is not required to
     occupying a primary duty station established for that specialty, but must be actually
     performing instructor duties. Except as provided for in this section, members must be
     qualified and current in the aircraft to log instructor time. Except as provided for in AFI 65-
     503 and Paragraph 3.4.3.1, the total instructor flight time for each aircrew specialty will not
     exceed the total flight time.
        3.4.3.1. Instructors may log instructor time while accomplishing unlike specialty training
        instruction (e.g., an instructor navigator training pilots/boom operators for the three-
        person crew or third pilots in the navigator seat). Only the amount of time used to train a
        specific event may be logged as instructor time. If more than one instructor of like
        specialty are on the aircraft to provide simultaneous instruction for crewmembers of
        different specialties, both instructors may log instructor time (e.g., two instructor
        navigators are on the same aircraft, one is instructing a student navigator and the other is
        instructing a boom operator). In this case, total instructor time logged may exceed total
        flight time logged. Enter a remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781 explaining the
        rationale for logging excess instructor time.
        3.4.3.2. Two instructors (to include FTU) of the same specialty may fly together and
        each log instructor time; however, total instructor time logged may not exceed total flight
        time logged. (e.g., A new FTU instructor is flying with a student crew and a more
        experienced FTU instructor flies with the new FTU instructor; instruction can occur
        between the new FTU instructor and student or between the experienced FTU instructor
        and new instructor, but not both simultaneously. Therefore, the total instructor time
        logged may not exceed total flight time.)
        3.4.3.2. (AETC) FTU instructors who are required to perform in-flight duties in support
        of formal student syllabus objectives will not log instructor time unless actively
        performing instructor duties.
        3.4.3.3. Aircrew members who are instructor qualified in one aircraft, and who are
        current and qualified (but not qualified as an instructor) in another aircraft, may log
        instructor time while flying in the second aircraft and providing instruction to an aircrew
        member in the first aircraft. This applies to instructors in single seat aircraft who are also
        qualified in chase aircraft, but who do not maintain instructor qualification in the chase
        aircraft. Instructor time may be logged only while actively providing instruction. Enter a
        remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781 to explain the rationale for logging instructor
        time in the chase aircraft (this paragraph may be cited as a reference).
        3.4.3.4. Instructors will log primary, secondary, or other time, depending on their
        activity, when not performing instructor duties.
        3.4.3.5. Log simulator console time as instructor time when the crewmember is qualified
        as an instructor in the aircraft. When MAJCOMs authorize crewmembers to be
        instructors in the simulator only, they may log simulator console time as instructor time.
        MAJCOMs will determine which types of simulators qualify for this approval, e.g.,
        operational flight trainers, weapon system trainers, etc.
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                       95


     3.4.3.5. (AETC) Simulator-only instructors operating the console or instructing students
     in an OFT, WST, PTT, or Frasca Model 242 flight training device may log instructor
     time on the AFTO Form 781.
  3.4.4. Evaluator Flight Time. Flight time flown by a designated and certified flight
  evaluator while actively performing authorized flight evaluation duties. Includes "hands on"
  time if coincident with performance of flight evaluator duties. The member is not required to
  occupy a primary duty station established for that specialty, but must be actually performing
  evaluator duties. Evaluators will also log instructor, primary, secondary, or other time,
  depending on their activity, when not performing evaluator duties.
  3.4.4. (AETC) Flight evaluators authorized to evaluate on aircraft in which they are not
  qualified will log ―Other‖ flight time on the AFTO Form 781. An evaluator in the grade of
  colonel or above will use aircrew certification code ―O_‖; lieutenant colonels and below will
  use aircrew certification code ―X_.‖
     3.4.4.1. (Added) Aircrew members who are designated and certified as a flight
     evaluator in one aircraft, and who are current and qualified (but not certified as a flight
     evaluator) in another aircraft, may log evaluator time while flying in the second aircraft
     and evaluating an aircrew member in the first aircraft. This applies to flight evaluators in
     single seat aircraft who are also qualified in chase aircraft, but who are not certified as a
     flight evaluator in the chase aircraft. Enter a remark on the back of the AFTO Form 781
     to explain the rationale for logging evaluator time in the chase paragraph (this paragraph
     may be cited as a reference).
  3.4.5. Other Flight Time. Flight time flown by members who are on the flight
  authorization, but who are not occupying a designated duty station or conforming to the
  requirements of primary, secondary, instructor, or evaluator time. For example: additional or
  extra crewmembers taking part in the flight, required for the mission to augment the crew or
  perform mission-related observation or evaluator duties (not qualified in the aircraft).
  Indoctrination fliers log other time. Crewmembers will log other time during periods of crew
  rest or sleep.
  3.4.6. Combat and Combat Support Flight Time.
     3.4.6.1. Combat. Aerial activity, engagements, or attacks conducted by aircraft against
     an enemy of the US or an opposing foreign force when there is risk of exposure to hostile
     fire. Aerial activity in support of forces engaged in combat when there is risk of exposure
     to hostile fire. Combat includes both elements: activity against an enemy or opposing
     force (or activity supporting forces engaging an enemy or opposing force) and risk of
     exposure to hostile fire.
         3.4.6.1.1. As soon as possible after a combat zone is established, the Commander Air
         Force Forces (COMAFFOR) will identify which portion constitutes hostile airspace.
         Hostile airspace is airspace within a combat zone that has been specifically
         designated as hostile airspace by the COMAFFOR, based on risk of exposure to
         hostile fire. The combat zone may contain areas that are not designated as hostile
         airspace. For the purposes of logging combat time the aerial activity must be
         accomplished in a designated combat zone within the designated hostile airspace.
         Flight within the combat zone but outside of the designated area or areas of hostile
96                                        AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


            airspace does not qualify as combat time, since there is no risk of exposure to hostile
            fire. (EXCEPTION: In cases of aircrews that employ standoff weapons, the
            COMAFFOR under extraordinary circumstances may permit those aircrews to log
            combat time outside of the hostile airspace and/or outside of the designated combat
            zone. If an exception is granted, include the exception in the guidance designating the
            combat zone and the hostile airspace.) COMAFFOR will publish guidelines
            specifying which aircraft missions may log combat/combat support flight time and
            will identify the inclusive dates that the hostile airspace is activated for logging
            combat time. During contingencies when a combat zone is not designated but the use
            of force is authorized, COMAFFOR will coordinate with AF/A3/5 to establish hostile
            airspace criteria and guidelines for logging combat/combat support flight time.
            NOTE:COMAFFOR will issue new guidance and procedures every two years to
            ensure all Air Force units are aware of the current policy.
        3.4.6.2. Combat Support. Aerial activity, engagements, or attacks conducted by aircraft
        against an enemy of the US or an opposing foreign force that operate outside the
        designated hostile airspace, where there is no risk of exposure to hostile fire. Includes
        aerial activity directly supporting forces engaged in combat or directly supporting those
        who are actively supporting combat when the aerial activity occurs outside the designated
        hostile airspace. Hostile airspace is determined as described above under combat time.
        3.4.6.3. Combat or combat support time will be logged from takeoff to landing when an
        individual: (1) meets the requirements of combat/combat support flight time, (2) is on an
        AO that requires the member to fly, (3) is listed on the flight authorization authorized to
        perform in-flight aircrew duties and, (4) is required for the mission IAW paragraph 3.3
        of this instruction. Additionally, eligible members authorized to fly IAW paragraph
        3.7.1 may log combat or combat support time. Do not combine mission symbols; use one
        symbol for the entire flight.
     3.4.7. Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Time. UAS crews may be authorized to
     simultaneously control more than one aircraft during flight operations. The total time logged
     by each individual will reflect the total time spent controlling aircraft inflight and is not
     dependent upon the number of aircraft actually controlled. Flight time logged will not exceed
     the time the individual was performing inflight duties.
3.5. Flight Condition Time. The categories listed in Paragraph 3.4are the basis for
accumulating flying experience for all flying personnel. Record all flying time accrued on a
mission in the appropriate category. Provisions have been made to record, for historical
purposes, a breakout of flight time by flight condition: night, instrument, and simulated
instrument. Primary time flown in more than one condition simultaneously (for example, night
and instrument) would result in entries under both of these categories on the form. The type of
time logged will be consistent with the flight condition actually encountered or procedure
accomplished. MAJCOMs may further restrict logging combinations that are inconsistent with
command policy or procedures. Use the following guidance for logging flight condition time:
     3.5.1. Night Time. That portion of primary, secondary, instructor, or evaluator flight time
     logged between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight,
     as published in the American Air Almanac. (EXCEPTION: An evaluator will log night time
     as a flight condition in conjunction with "other" flight time when performing evaluation
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                      97


   duties onboard aircraft in which he or she does not maintain qualification.) Crewmembers
   having night training requirements (includes wear of NVG) specified by Air Force or
   MAJCOM publications will log this time. For personnel assigned at latitudes above 60
   degrees north (May through August) or below 60 degrees south (November through
   February), night requirements are waived when removal from active flying or PCS occurs
   during the summer months. May be logged in a flight simulator when operating in simulated
   night conditions.
   3.5.2. Primary Instrument Time. The portion of primary, instructor, or evaluator flight
   time logged when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude be maintained
   primarily by reference to the flight instruments. Pilots only will log this time when
   performing duties in this flight condition.
   3.5.3. Primary Simulated Instrument Time. The portion of primary, "hands-on"
   instructor, or "hands-on" evaluator time logged by an individual controlling the aircraft
   attitude primarily by reference to the flight instruments. Pilots only will log this time when
   performing duties in this flight condition. May be logged in a flight simulator.
   3.5.3. (AETC) Do not log primary simulated instrument time while flying with an
   undergraduate student pilot. Exceptions: synthetic trainers and instrument flight simulators.
   3.5.4. Night Vision Goggle Time. The portion of flight time logged by an aircrew member
   wearing night vision goggles between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of
   morning civil twilight, as published in the American Air Almanac. Crewmembers performing
   aircrew duties in a crew position with NVG training requirements will log this time while
   wearing NVGs. NVG time may also be logged by flight surgeons and aircrew members
   instructing or evaluating individuals who are performing crew duties where NVGs are
   required and worn. NVG time will not exceed total night time logged. NVG time may be
   logged in a flight simulator if the simulator is accredited for NVG training (simulator model
   and simulator software).
3.6. Non-rated Flight Time. Non-rated aircrew members will log flying time using the proper
flight authorization duty code. Log time only when authorized on AOs and when actively
performing specific inflight duties as designated by flight authorization orders (Paragraph 3.9).
Aeromedical evacuation crewmembers log time only when listed on the flight authorization and
actively engaged in operational air evacuation or air rescue missions; aeromedical research and
development inflight; or air evacuation training missions that require AECMs in a crew position,
being instructed, being evaluated, or as listed in Paragraph 3.4.2.4above.

Section 3C—Logging of Flight Activity (General)

3.7. Logging Flight Time for Pay. Credit only flight time logged according to Paragraph
3.3toward incentive pay requirements. Flight time flown in "O" or "X" status does not entitle the
member to OFDA credit, ACIP or HDIP. NOTE. See Attachment 2,                              Table
A2.3.EXCEPTION: Air Technicians (AT) and Air Reserve Technicians (ART) must be in
military status to log time for incentive pay. This Air Force Instruction and MAJCOMs define
the inflight duties that qualify individuals for ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP.
98                                          AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


     3.7.1. Logging Flight Time by Rated Officers and CEAs Who are Qualified in One
     Aircraft and Not Other Types of Aircraft Assigned to Their Units. MAJCOMS and
     equivalent organizations, and subordinate organizations, may authorize commanders
     (including unit commanders) and key supervisors (API 6, 8, B, or D) who are qualified and
     maintain currency in one type aircraft, but have other types assigned to their units, to fly in a
     primary crew position in assigned aircraft in which they are not qualified. Individuals will be
     under the supervision of an instructor for the applicable crew position. The crewmember will
     log an "O" or "X" as the aircrew qualification code first character and his or her assigned
     second character crew position code IAW Table A2.3 (As noted above, Flight time flown in
     "O" or "X" status does not entitle the member to OFDA credit, ACIP or HDIP.) See also
     paragraph 3.4.1.1.1 Members who fly IAW this paragraph will log all applicable flight time,
     to include combat or combat support time (see paragraph 3.4.6.3).
3.8. Logging Flight Time by Rated Officers and Career Enlisted Aviators in Inactive
Flying Status. Personnel in such status do not log flying time in their specialty in US
Government aircraft except as provided in FAC waivers listed in Table2.2, paragraphs 2.9.2.2.,
2.10.1.1., and 2.16In all such cases, inactive crewmembers must maintain physical and
physiological qualification (if applicable) for aviation service.
3.9. Non-rated Crewmembers and Operational Support Flight Time. Inflight duties
authorized by Air Force and MAJCOM instructions determine the proper flying duty or position
symbol for logging flight time on AFTO Form 781. This flying time is accomplished when
actively performing inflight duties as follows:
     3.9.1. Non-rated Crewmember Duty. When on AOs and properly assigned to an
     authorized non-rated aircrew position as part of the regularly constituted crew IAW AFIs 11-
     401, 11-402, and 65-503, and:
        3.9.1.1. The individual‘s primary duty requires the performance of inflight duties on a
        frequent and regular basis.
        3.9.1.2. The approved inflight duties are essential to operating aircraft systems and
        associated equipment required for mission accomplishment.
     3.9.2. Operational Support (Non-crewmember) Duty. Members are placed on AOs for a
     specified time and must be properly authorized to perform inflight duties not prescribed in
     AFI 65-503 and to supplement a regularly constituted aircrew. They are on flight status for
     limited periods to perform essential and specific in-flight duties that cannot be accomplished
     by authorized aircrew personnel. Refer to AFI 11-402 for guidance.
3.10. Logging Flight Time in Non-US Air Force Aircraft. Only members performing inflight
duties authorized by Paragraph 1.11 may log flying time in non-Air Force aircraft for credit
towards OFDA requirements or incentive pay. Otherwise only "Other" flight time will be
credited in an individual"s flight records.
3.11. Logging Other US Military Time. Total career flight time obtained in the service of
other US military agencies when not officially directed by the Air Force, and when verified by
logbook or other official records certified by authorized persons. This time will be entered into
ARMS in the Other US Military hour block. Time obtained in other US military aircraft is not
included in this category if performed in an official capacity (e.g., directed by competent Air
Force order); such time is recorded as Air Force rated time.
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                       99


3.12. Logging Student Time. Total career flight time acquired by rated trainees in USAF or
USAF-directed undergraduate flight training prior to attaining a rating. This time will be entered
into ARMS in the student time hour block.
3.13. Logging Foreign Military Time. Total career flight time obtained in the service of other
governments when not officially directed by the Air Force, and when verified by logbook or
other official record certified by authorized persons. This time will be entered into ARMS in the
Foreign Military hour block.
3.14. Logging Flight Time in Other Than Military Aircraft. Flight time logged according to
Paragraph 3.3in other than military aircraft is credited toward annual flying requirements only
when directed by competent Air Force AOs and such flying is inherent in the primary duty
assignment of the person concerned. Aircrews must document flight time on an AFTO Form 781
or AF Form 3250 and, except for CAP-USAF or Introductory Flying Training missions, be in
aircraft with 450 or more rated horsepower.
3.15. Logging Civilian Flight Time. Total career flight time acquired in civilian aircraft of 450
or more rated horsepower, when verified by logbook or other official record certified by
authorized persons. (These authorized persons are operations officers of military aviation
activities; suitable agents of commercial aviation companies; operating managers of fields from
which the reported flying was performed, if in privately owned aircraft; and officials of
recognized civil flight schools.) This time will be entered into ARMS in the civilian hour block.
3.16. Quarterly General Officer Flying Hour Information Report. MAJCOMs will submit
Quarterly GO Flying Hour Information Report (RCS: HAF-A3O[Q]0702) via message to HQ
USAF/A3OT by the 15of the month following each calendar quarter. This report is designated
emergency status code C-3. Submit data requirements as prescribed, but they may be delayed to
allow the submission of higher precedence reports. Continue reporting during emergency
conditions, delayed precedence. Discontinue reporting during MINIMIZE. The report will
include the following:
3.16. (AETC) Quarterly General Officer Flying Hour Information Report. Wings will E-
mail the Quarterly General Officer Flying Hour Information Report (RCS: HAF-A3O (Q) 0702)
to HQ AETC/A3FV by the 5th of the month following each calendar quarter.
   3.16.1. Rank/Name/Position. Include general officer selectees.
   3.16.2. Aircraft qualification/aircrew status.
   3.16.3. Flight Authorization Duty Codes.
   3.16.4. Aircrew Position Indicator Code/Aviation Service Code.
   3.16.5. Total flight hours/sorties in all aircraft in which the member maintains qualification
   (AF Form 8) by aircraft and by flight time category.

(K-, Q-, or X-prefixed Air Force Specialty Code) personnel responsible for the safe ground and
flight operation of the aircraft and onboard systems, or for airborne duties essential to
accomplishment of the aircraft‘s mission. Includes members in initial formal training for
immediate assignment to an authorized operational flying position. Individuals must be on
aeronautical orders and assigned to an authorized position according to AFI 65-503, US Air
Force Cost and Planning Factors, or nonrated aircrew not in an aircraft‘s basic crew
complement, but required for the mission. Aircrew members perform their principal duties
inflight and their presence is required for the aircraft to accomplish its primary tasked mission.
Duties must be essential to operating the aircraft or mission systems and equipment used for
completing a mission, or other duties essential to the aircraft‘s mission.
(Added-AETC) Auxiliary Field—Any landing field owned by the parent unit and used for
flying training.
NOTES:—*1. The term "navigator" includes all navigator specialties and is synonymous with
the designation Combat Systems Officer (CSO). New UFT graduates are designated CSOs, but
previously qualified individuals will continue to be identified as navigators.
*2. (DELETED)
Air Force Aircraft—US Government aircraft under US Air Force jurisdiction.
Airmanship Programs (USAFA)— Any USAF Academy course listed in the catalog and
administered by the 306 FTG at the Academy airfield or deployed location.

Authentication—The process that makes an administrative order official. Evidenced by proper
signature or seal that a document is genuine and official. The only seal authorized on AOs is on
Department of the Air Force (DAF) orders (For example: A DAF order that awards a pilot
rating).
Authorized Aircrews—Aircrews authorized according to AFI 65-503, USAF Cost and Planning
Factors, Attachment A36-1 (Authorized Aircrew Composition Active Forces), Attachment A37-
1 (Authorized Aircrew Composition Reserve Forces), and Attachment A38-1, (Authorized

as authorized in the Aviation Career Incentive Act of 1974, the Aviation Career Improvement
Act of 1989, and the FY 96 National Defense Authorization Act.
Aviation Service Date (ASD)—Effective date of the first aeronautical order to perform flight
duties. For rated officers, this date is set when the member first reports to the aviation activity
that has aircraft in which he or she will receive flight training leading to an aeronautical rating
and is placed on aeronautical orders (for example, class start date of SUPT, SUNT, or UPT-H
class or Weapons Systems Training) or date of commission, whichever is later. For flight
surgeons, the ASD equals the date all requirements for the flight surgeon rating were met, which
is normally the date Course 50BY9351 or equivalent was completed. (EXCEPTION: The ASD
for medical students who have completed Course 50BY9351 will be the date post graduate
medical training is completed, an unrestricted medical license is attained, AFSC 48XX is
awarded, and the flight surgeon rating is assigned. All requirements must be accomplished for
award of the ASD.) For Air Battle Managers, the ASD is the date the crewmember enters formal
ABM flying training (class start date). For career enlisted aviators, the ASD is set when the
member first reports to the aviation activity that has aircraft in which he or she will receive flight
training leading to career enlisted aviator status and is placed on aeronautical orders. Rated
ASDs and CEA ASDs are established separately. See also AFI 11-402.
Aviation Programs (USAFA)— Any USAF Academy course listed in the catalog and
administered by the Dean of Faculty in conjunction with the 306 FTG at the Academy airfield or
deployed location.
Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA)—Personnel in AFSCs 1AXXX and 8A000.

individual is assigned or attached for flying. If an individual is geographically separated from the
wing, authority may be delegated to a group or squadron level.
Conditional Entitlement—The condition under which rated officers and career enlisted aviators
in an aviation career are entitled to receive ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP, conditional to meeting
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                       111


minimum monthly flying time standards IAW DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Chapters 22
and 24, and AFI 11-421.
Continuation Training—The continuation training program provides crew members with the
volume, frequency, and mix of training (flying and ground training) necessary to maintain
proficiency in the assigned qualification level. This training must be recorded in the ARMS
database.
Continuous Entitlement—The condition under which rated officers and career enlisted aviators
in an aviation career are entitled to receive ACIP or CEFIP without regard to flight activity.
Flight—For the purpose of this instruction only, a flight is synonymous with a mission.
Flight Authorization (FA)—A single document used to identify all aircrew, operational
support, and authorized non-interference members on AOs, who are qualified and required to
perform duties on specific aircraft for a scheduled mission. MEP may be placed on the flight
authorization, only in the Remarks section. AE/PJ FAs are attached to the aircraft FA for the
mission(s) on which they performed duties.
Form—Term used to identify Air Force forms and IMTs (Information Management Tools).
IAW AFI 33-360, the IMT designator is being phased out; it is not used in this publication.
Frequent And Regular—"Frequent and regular" is a DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Part Two,
term which establishes the minimum monthly flight requirements to be entitled to conditional
Aviation Career Incentive Pay (ACIP), Career Enlisted Flight Incentive Pay (CEFIP), or
Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP). DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Part Two, sets the
minimum at four hours for active duty (DoDFMR, Part Two) and two hours for Air Reserve
Components (ARC) per calendar month, or a prorated share for lesser periods. By itself, the
requirement to fly frequently and regularly is not justification to assign an individual to aircrew
or operational support flier status. There must be a need to perform inflight duties.
Government Aircraft—An aircraft owned, operated, or leased by the US Government.
Hazardous Duty Incentive Pay (HDIP)—Incentive pay authorized for personnel required to
perform flight duties on a frequent and regular basis.

pertains to entitlement to these incentive pays along with auditing and reconciliation of these
incentive pays; and the single point of contact for ARMS. This position is inherently
governmental.
Instrument Flight—Flight conducted when external conditions require that the aircraft attitude
be maintained primarily by reference to the flight instruments.
Intent—For the purpose of publishing an Aeronautical Order, the intent of an AO is to validate
individual qualification for aviation and/or parachutist service, authorize and direct frequent and
112                                        AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


regular participation in aerial flight or parachute duties; and establish or terminate individual
entitlement to ACIP, CEFIP, and HDIP. Intent also includes the effective date of the AO.
Interfly—The exchange and/or substitution of aircrews and aircraft between MAJCOMs.
Mission—For the purpose of this instruction only, mission is defined as a primary objective for
which an aircraft is operated (see Mission Symbols) and which may consist of an increment of
one or more sorties. Several missions may be accomplished in one sortie. See .
Mission Essential Ground Personnel (MEGP)—(DELETED).
Mission Essential Personnel (MEP)—personnel who are required for the execution of the
aircraft or unit mission, to include follow-on missions. Includes additional aircrew members
required for follow-on missions (may be further defined in MAJCOM supplements to this
instruction) and personnel not authorized AOs who are tasked to perform ground support duties
at enroute locations or destination points that are directly related and essential to accomplishment
of the aircraft or unit mission, e.g. a specialist or technician required to provide aircraft support
or a security team required to guard the aircraft. MEP may include military staff personnel and
U.S. Government employees when those individuals are required for the mission. MAJCOMs
may further define MEP in supplements to this instruction but guidance may not be less
restrictive than the guidance contained herein. The OG/CC (or equivalent) with operational
control of the aircraft grants MEP status. (EXCEPTIONS: For AMC missions already in the
system, the TACC Senior Controller may approve MEP status. MAJCOM
Standardization/Evaluation Chiefs may approve MEP status for MAJCOM or MAJCOM-gained
missions for evaluators assigned to the MAJCOM.) If operational control transfers, the OG/CC
(or equivalent) who assumes follow-on operational control may continue/revise MEP status
(coordinate changes with originating authority). MAJCOMs may establish intra-command and
inter-command guidance to facilitate this process. MEP, to include additional crewmembers
who fly in MEP status, are passengers and may only fly in aircraft capable of carrying
passengers IAW the provisions of DoD 4515.13-R. (EXCEPTION: MEP who are mission
essential to aircraft launch/ recovery may fly on aircraft not normally equipped for carrying
passengers. MEP who fly under the provisions of this exception must be physically and
physiologically [when required] qualified and must complete applicable egress training prior to
flight.)
(AETC) Mission Essential Personnel (MEP)—Military staff personnel and U.S. government
employees accompanying a general officer on an approved AETC mission may fly in MEP status
only. Submit requests to the appropriate flying unit for OG/CC approval. After approval, the
OG/CC must forward a copy of the approved authorization to 19 AF/DOO and AETC/A3FV.
Officer Service Date (OSD)—Effective date of service as a commissioned, warrant, or flight
officer, whether or not served on extended active duty. This is usually equivalent to total federal
commissioned service date backdated by any period served as a warrant or flight officer. For
flight surgeons, the OSD includes constructive service granted medical officers in the
computation of creditable service for basic pay.
Operational Flying—Flying performed under competent orders by rated and CEA personnel
(primarily for mission, support, or training purposes) while serving in an assignment where basic
flying skills usually are maintained for performing assigned duties.

Operational Support Flier—An individual whose primary, full-time duty does not require
flying. The Air Force may require these individuals to fly on an occasional basis to perform a
specific, essential inflight duty that cannot be performed by an assigned aircrew member. Duties
may include, but are not limited to inflight test, operation, or inflight maintenance of specific
aircraft systems or installed equipment. To receive non-crew hazardous duty pay, operational
support fliers must be placed on aeronautical orders and complete prescribed flying hour
requirements. Authorized man-months are required prior to issuance of aeronautical orders.
Orientation Flight—Continuous flights in DoD-owned aircraft performed within the local
flying area and terminating at the point of origin. See also paragraph and .
Pilot In Command—The aircrew member designated by competent authority as being in
command of an aircraft and responsible for its safe operation and accomplishment of the
assigned mission.
Point-To-Point—Point-to-point means flights that takeoff from one location and land at a
different location. Point-to-point orientation flights are not authorized.
Sortie—An AFTO Form 781 aircraft sortie begins when the aircraft begins to move forward on
takeoff or takes off vertically from rest at any point of support. It ends after airborne flight when
the aircraft returns to the surface and either of the following conditions occur: a) the engines are
stopped, or the aircraft is on the surface for five minutes, whichever occurs first; or, b) a change
is made in the crew which enplanes or deplanes a crewmember. For logging aircrew proficiency
training, on missions during which some crewmembers deplane and the remaining crew from the
original takeoff re-launch, this may be considered to be a continuation of the original aircrew
sortie. MAJCOMs may establish MDS-specific crew requirements and procedures for aircrew
continuation sorties.
STANAG 3526 AMD—Interchangeability of NATO Aircrew Medical Categories.
Supervisory Aircrew Or Staff Member—Personnel in supervisory or staff positions (API 6, 8,
B, and D) who actively fly; or in positions (API 3, 4, C, and E) that require aircrew expertise but
individuals are not required to fly.
Training Level—Assigned to individuals based on the continuation training aircrew status
(basic aircraft qualification, basic mission capable, or mission ready/combat mission ready) they
are required to maintain.
Training Period—Any training period determined by the MAJCOM or Wing in which training
requirements are performed.
Unit Commander—When used in this instruction, "unit commander" refers to the squadron
commander (or comparable level) or higher level within the chain of command.
UNRAPP— USAFA Non-Rated Airmanship/Aviation Program Participants. Includes service
academy/ROTC cadets/midshipmen, foreign exchange students assigned to USAFA, 306 FTG-
assigned/USAFA assigned casual status officers previously qualified in USAFA airmanship and
aviation programs, DoD/contractor (FAA-rated pilots, USPA-licensed parachute instructors,
civilian coaches, FAA-designated flight examiners) and other personnel specifically authorized
by HQAETC/A2/3 to participate in USAFA airmanship programs.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AFTO FORM 781, ARMS AIRCREW/MISSION FLIGHT
                         DATA DOCUMENT

A2.1. Purpose. The AFTO Form 781-series provides maintenance, inspection, service
configuration, and flight operations records for weapon or support systems. AFTO Form
781,ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, is the source document for recording and
reporting operational flight or training device information for each individual authorized to take
part in a mission. This form is the primary record of both personnel and aerospace vehicle flying
hours. It is the official record to validate flight pay eligibility for rated, CEA, and other non-rated
officer and enlisted members required to fly. The original AFTO Form 781 must be maintained
in the HARM office that services the unit to which the aircraft is assigned. This form is available
for downloading on the e-publishing website atwww.e-publishing.af.mil.
A2.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all members authorized to log flight or training device
time in an airborne duty or position for the purpose of maintaining an official Air Force Flight
Record.
A2.3. Responsibilities. The AFTO Form 781 is established by TO 00-20-1. In most cases,
maintenance personnel are responsible for distributing and collecting these forms. Completing
the AFTO Form 781 and other forms in the series is a joint responsibility of maintenance
personnel and the pilot in command.
   A2.3.1. The crew chief or alternate ensures a sufficient number of copies of AFTO Form
   781 are onboard the aircraft and completes items 2 through 5 on a sufficient number of
   copies to fulfill mission requirements. If the forms are generated in advance, the pilot in
   command will confirm with maintenance personnel the correct data for items 2 and 3.
   A2.3.2. The pilot in command ensures the AFTO Form 781 is dated and properly completed
   to show all pertinent flight data and the flight time for all personnel authorized to take part in
   the flight. The pilot in command will initial item 40 for each flight sequence flown under
   item 6.
       A2.3.2.1. (DELETED) .
       A2.3.2.2. (DELETED) .
       A2.3.2.3. (DELETED) .
   A2.3.3. The completed AFTO Form 781 must processed in the maintenance information
   system and delivered to the SARM for ARMS updating, then provided to the HARM office.
       A2.3.4.1. Gives to the maintenance organization that services the aircraft assigned to that
       unit the necessary organization and location information to be entered in items 4 and 5 of
       AFTO Form 781. This ensures completed forms are sent to the proper SARM or HARM
       office for entry into ARMS.
       A2.3.4.2. Ensures a responsible individual audits the unit's AFTO Forms 781 for
       accuracy and eligibility and initials in item 41 of the form before sending it to the HARM
       office. Where local procedures establish the HARM office as the auditing agency, the
       responsible individual from that office initials the form in item 41.
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                         115


       A2.3.4.3. The original copy of the AFTO Form 781 must be provided to the HARM
       office that services the unit to which the aircraft is assigned no later than 5 days after the
       end of the month in which the flights were performed. For example, the Form 781 for a
       flight flown in March must be turned in to the servicing HARM office NLT 5 April.
       EXCEPTION: ARC units that track/maintain ACIP and CEFIP entitlement information
       may forward the AFTO Forms 781 to the servicing HARM office not later than the first
       day following two months after the month in which the flight was performed. In the
       above example, the forms would not be required to be turned into the HARM office until
       1 June.
           A2.3.4.3.1. SARM offices will not maintain duplicate copies of AFTO Forms 781
           (including extracts). If changes are required after the flight information has been
           entered in ARMS and the form is at the HARM office, the pilot in command must
           contact the HARM office to make corrections.

Table A2.1. AFTO Form 781 Entries.
ITEM    ENTER
2       MDS designator from AFTO Form 781F, item 12. Example F016A.
3       Enter the aircraft serial number. Use the following format for entry in ARMS, last
        two digits of the year, followed by a dash, then the last four digits of the tail number.
        Example: 83-0142.
4       Organization to which the aircraft is assigned. Show command designation in
        parentheses (for example, 52 FW (USAFE). This will be the HARM office that

5       The name of the installation whose HARM office services the unit charged for flying
        hours identified in item 4 and processes and files the original AFTO Form 781.
AFTO FORM 781 ENTRIES (CERTIFIED BY THE PILOT IN COMMAND)
1       Date. Use the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) date in the following ARMS
        compatible format: (Example) 22 Sep 2008
6       The flight sequence of each particular leg of the flight.
7       Mission number assigned for this leg of the mission (MAJCOM option).
8       Authorized mission symbol for each flight. Aircrew may enter all flights on the
        same GMT date on a single AFTO Form 781.
9       International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code for the base or airport where
        the aircraft takes off. If a flight is continued from a previous entry, enter "INFL."
        Use ―XXXX‖ for classified locations or locations without an official ICAO identifier
        (i.e. a CV-22 landing in a field).
10      Base ICAO code for the base or airport where the aircraft lands. If a flight is
        terminated without landing for a change in mission symbol, enter "INFL." Use
        ―XXXX‖ for classified locations or locations without an official ICAO identifier.
11      24-hour GMT clock time. The takeoff time is when the aircraft begins to move
        forward on takeoff roll.
12      24-hour GMT clock time. The landing is when the aircraft is on the ground after
        being airborne and any of the following conditions occur: (a) The engines are
        stopped and shutdown occurs at or before five minutes after touchdown. (b) The
        aircraft has been on the ground for five minutes after touchdown; however, a series
116                                      AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


            of practice landings is considered one flight. (c) A change is made in the crew where
            a crewmember enplanes or deplanes. NOTE: When a flight starts before 2400 GMT
            and ends after GMT midnight (2400Z), record and report the flight on the date of
            takeoff. A separate AFTO Form 781 is not necessary.
13          Subtract takeoff time from landing time. Use the conversion table to the right to
            convert to hours and tenths, and enter the result.
14          Number of touch-and-go, full stop, and total landings.
15          Number of sorties accomplished. A sortie covers a flight from first take off to
            landing as described in block 12; however, if any flight entry is split (INFL), the
            sortie will be recorded on the flight that lists final landing.
16          Special use as specified by MAJCOM.
17          Flight authorization number generated in the SARM as specified in AFI 11-421.
            (MAJCOM option.)
18          Unit issuing the flight authorization and designated to perform this mission
            (MAJCOM option).
TOTALS Sum of flight sequences ―a‖ through ―f‘‖ for total flight time, landings, and sorties at
            the end of the mission.
19          Four-digit unit number to which the crewmember is assigned/attached for flying
            purposes. Use leading zeros when the unit number has fewer than four digits.
20          Last four digits of the SSN of the crewmember. An error in this entry will result in
            time being lost or credited to another crewmember.
21          Crewmember‘s last name (printed). May use additional characters if another
            member in the unit has the same last name.
22          Flight Authorization (FA) Duty Code assigned on the FA to the crewmember for this
            mission. This code cannot be higher than the individual‘s current qualification, but
            will indicate duties that the individual crewmember is scheduled to perform on the
            mission. For example, if the individual is an IP, but is scheduled to perform MP
            duties on a mission, the individual will be listed as an MP on the Flight
            Authorization. Refer to Table A2.3 for a complete list of duty codes. NOTE: The
            only time the FA code will not match the scheduled duties on the FA is for
            extenuating circumstances. The AC must document the reason in the remarks of the
            AFTO Form 781. For example, a pilot was scheduled to perform IP duties in
            conjunction with upgrade training for a second pilot; however, the upgrading
            individual was DNIF and did not fly, so the pilot only performed primary duties. MP
            is logged with primary time and the AC documents the reason in the remarks section.
            When using the FA more than one day, log FA Duty Code actually performed and
            annotate in remarks if different from the FA.
23-28       Times in hours and tenths for each category as defined in Chapter 3 of this
            instruction. The total time in item 28 cannot exceed the grand total in item 13 and
            total of items 23 through 27 cannot exceed item 28.
29          Total number of sorties for this crewmember. Entry is normally the grand total (see
            item 15, above).
30, 33, 34, Hours and tenths of time performed in night, instrument, simulated or NVG
36          conditions, as defined in Chapter 3 of this instruction.
35, 37      Number of Combat and Combat Support Sorties flown that meet requirements as
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                      117


           defined in Chapter 3 of this instruction.
38         Air Reserve Component Flight Duty Status Code for the crewmember, if applicable.
           If used: 1=Active Duty, 2=Unit Training Assembly (Inactive Duty), 3=Flying
           Training Period (Inactive Period), 33=Dual Additional Flying Training Period
           (Inactive Duty), 4=Civilian (ART).
39         Initials of maintenance personnel at the debriefing who reviewed the form.
40         Initials of the pilot in command who certifies the form for accuracy. For multiple
           sorties, the pilot in command initials for each sortie sequence. If the pilot in
           command changes during multiple sorties, the individual who acted as pilot in
           command for a particular sortie must initial in the sortie block. If the pilot in
           command changes during any single sortie, the last individual to act as pilot in
           command for that sortie will initial the sortie block.
41         Initials of the unit operations officer or Aviation Resource Manager (ARM) who
           verifies the accuracy and legibility of the form prior to entry into ARMS.
42         Date (e.g., 22 Sep 2008) and initials of the ARM who input and audited the form.
43         Date (e.g., 22 Sep 2008) and initials of the ARM who audited and processed the
           form.

Table A2.1. (AETC) AFTO Form 781 Entries.

     16   Units will enter the squadron to which the aircraft is assigned.
 Note (Added): Units may use Item 15 codes on the AFTO Form 781 and flight authorization
 after completion of the sorties.

A2.4. Extract AFTO Form 781. Each individual on the form whose flight records are
maintained by another HARM office prepares a data extract photocopy of the original AFTO
Form 781 to be sent, usually within five duty-days, to that member‘s HARM office. If more than
one individual named on the form is serviced by the HARM office, a single data extract copy
118                                      AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


may be used. For example Captain Grengs, a pilot from Minot AFB, flew a mission at Grand
Forks AFB. A photocopy of the AFTO Form 781 is made, certified in item 43, and sent to the
HARM office at Minot. Extracts at the same base for aircrew members serviced by the same
HARM office are not authorized.
     A2.4.1. Individuals whose flight records have been closed out to transfer custody must
     prepare a data extract form for each authorized flight during that period.
     A2.4.2. The data extract AFTO Form 781 is an exact copy of the original AFTO Form 781.
     A2.4.3. Upon receipt of an extract, member's servicing SARM/HARM personnel will lightly
     line through individual mission data lines of members not in the local ARMS database,
     leaving only the members they will enter in ARMS. The SARM office responsible for
     management of the original AFTO Form 781 will have a line lightly drawn through members
     who were extracted (not from aircraft's home station).
     A2.4.4. The data extract form is so identified and certified in item 43, either by a
     commissioned officer (preferably the pilot in command), a government civilian (when pilot
     in command), or by the HARM Chief/ Superintendent.

OPERATIONS NOTES:
1. For the P, R, and C mission symbols, use the following third character suffixes to identify missions
flown by specific MAJCOM: AMC use A, B, C; ACC use D, E, F; USAFE use G, H, I, J; PACAF use
K, L, M; AFSOC use N, O, P; ANG use Q, R, S; and AFRC use T, U, V; AETC use W, X, Y and
AFMC use Z. Guard and Reserve units will coordinate with their gaining MAJCOM to determine if
the Guard/Reserve or active duty MAJCOM suffix will be used. MAJCOMs will provide AF/A3O-AT
a copy of directives on the use of these mission symbols.
2. For all missions flown in designated combat areas, make the third character an A to differentiate
those combat missions where aerial delivery/recovery of airborne forces/equipment, ordnance
expended, or direct exposure to hostile fire occurred. The suffix B is used on designated combat
missions established by HQ USAF that result in personnel tour curtailment or other personnel actions.

       authorized non-crew in-flight duty
To meet OFDA, ACIP, CEFIP, or HDIP requirements, aircrew members must comply with the
following:
    1. Log their flight time using both an aircrew certification code and position identifier valid to
       credit time (a "yes" in column 3).
    2. Log primary, secondary or instructor flight time. Evaluator flight time is also creditable
      when the evaluator is current in the aircraft. Otherwise the evaluator should use the aircrew
      certification code O or X.
    3. Be attaining or maintaining qualification in the aircraft.
    4. Operational support fliers must log primary time to meet the requirement for HDIP. When
       not performing primary duties, they will log other time. Operational Support medical
       technicians on AOs will only log primary time when performing in-flight medical
       assistance to actual patients. Only other time is authorized for periods of the mission when
       medical assistance is not being provided. EXCEPTION: AFSPC and AETC medics will log
       primary time for that portion of the mission when they perform required temporary CEA
       duties on aircraft equipment (hoists and litters).
    5. Non-interference flyers (other than flying unit commanders and UAS sensor operators) must
       receive HQ USAF/A3OT approval to log flying time on AFTO Form 781 and enter data into
       ARMS. See paragraphs 3.3.1.5.2 and 3.3.1.5.3.
  6. Rated officers and CEAs will log second character crew position ―Z‖ when tasked to
    perform in-flight non-crew duties (e.g. safety observer). Include a remark on the back side of
    the AFTO Form 781 to explain the duty performed.
NOTE: MAJCOMs may specify additional characters and may provide supplemental guidance.

                        PREPARING AERONAUTICAL ORDERS

A3.1. AO Purpose. AOs are:
   A3.1.1. Published on AF Form 1887, or in an approved computer output format, AOs are
   used to validate individual qualification for aviation and parachutist service; to authorize and
   direct individual performance of duty that involves frequent and regular participation in
   aerial flight or parachute duties; to authorize and direct individuals (non-aircrew) to perform
   non-interference flying duties; and to establish or terminate individual entitlement to aviation
   career incentive pay (ACIP), career enlisted flyer incentive pay (CEFIP), and hazardous duty
   incentive pay (HDIP). HDIP for parachutists must specify static or HALO jump requirement
   and type of HDIP authorized. AOs initiating and authorizing aviation/parachutist service will
   not be effective before the member is medically qualified. This form is available for
   downloading on the e-publishing website atwww.e-publishing.af.mil.
   A3.1.2. Maintained in individual FRFs/JRFs to provide a complete chronological history of
   each individual‘s aviation/parachutist career. A record set will be maintained in the HARM
   office file system until moved to staging area.
   A3.1.3. Distributed according to Table A3.2.
   A3.1.4. Completed according to Table A3.1through Table A3.4.
   A3.1.5. Signed by the wing Host Aviation Resource Manager (HARM). The wing HARM
   must be an Aviation Resource Management SNCO (E-7 or above/civilian equivalent [GS-6]
   or E-7/GS-7 or above for ANG) with a seven (7) skill level, with at least three years
   experience in the 1C0 career field, a current CHARM qualification, and SEI Code
   066.NOTE:The MAJCOM 1C0 Functional Manager may waive this requirement. All waiver
   requests will include full justification, proof of member‘s qualification (copy of 1C0 training
   record AO task certification), and expected get well date. Send an information copy to
   AF/A3O-ATF for waivers approved for longer than 180 days.
      A3.1.5.1. With approval of the MAJCOM 1C0 Functional Manager and subject to the
      qualification requirements listed in ParagraphA3.1.5, the assistant CHARM may sign
      aeronautical orders on behalf of the CHARM. Additionally, the statement "Signed for"
      must be written or typed above the signature block and the assistant CHARM will sign
      his or her name above the CHARM‘s signature block. The MAJCOM 1C0 Functional
      Manager will document this approval.
A3.2. AO Publication. Publish AOs for:
   A3.2.1. Officers and CEAs qualified for an aviation career (restricted to rated officers,
   officers in flying training leading to award of an aeronautical rating, or enlisted members in
   flying training leading to the CEA designation) to:
      A3.2.1.1. Start or stop the requirement to perform operational flight/jump duty.
      A3.2.1.2. Direct and record changes to ASC and incentive pay entitlement. When the
      AO initiates or terminates flight/jump pay at the same time as the ASC change, complete
      the bottom portion of the AO. This serves as a Military Pay Order (MPO) to start and
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                         131


      stop flight/jump incentive pay. HARM offices will use a DD Form 114 to start and stop
      past or future entitlements based on qualifications or actions not applicable to the current
      AO. MPOs may be cut as separate documents to control privacy act information
      contained in aeronautical order remarks section.
   A3.2.2. Members (officer and enlisted) not qualified for an aviation/parachutist career to:
      A3.2.2.1. Initiate or terminate member‘s requirement to perform regular and frequent
      flight as a crewmember.
      A3.2.2.2. Direct and record changes to ASC, FAC 4, 5, 6, 8, and E duties and incentive
      pay entitlement.
      A3.2.2.3. Establish or terminate member‘s requirement to perform frequent and regular
      parachute jump duties as a parachutist member.
      A3.2.2.4. Initiate operational support and non-interference flying. Once AO terminates,
      it is no longer in effect. Do not publish an AO to terminate aviation service for these
      members.
      A3.2.2.5. Track members required to perform UAV sensor operator duties. Termination
      date will be three years from the AO effective date or member‘s DOS, whichever occurs
      first. The AO will read as follows: ―Initiate Sensor Operator Duties.‖
   A3.2.3. Award authorized basic ratings and badges. AOs that award aeronautical ratings,
   aircrew member badges, and parachutist ratings are single-action orders. NOTE: Do not
   publish an AO to award advanced ratings or badges. HARM personnel will validate
   advanced ratings/badge criteria was satisfied IAW AFI 11-402 and update advanced
   ratings/badges in ARMS only. The day the information is updated in ARMS is the effective
   date for award of an advanced rating/badge. NOTE: HARM offices may publish AOs for
   professionally qualified government civilian employees using AF Form 1887. Do not publish
   AOs for qualified members of other US military or foreign services (unless in UFT), or
   government contractors. Place all members on the unit‘s flight authorization. (See
   paragraph 1.8.) Validate US military and foreign service members have competent orders
   (AOs) from their respective service directing them to perform flying duties. HARM offices
   may enter other US military, foreign service, government contractor, or government civilian
   members in ARMS for the purpose of tracking aircrew training and physical/physiological
   qualifications when the member will perform flying duties on a frequent basis.
A3.3. General Instructions.
   A3.3.1. The HARM office prepares AOs IAW this instruction and inputs from unit HARM
   offices, commanders (including unit commanders) and AF/A3O-AT.
      A3.3.1.1. Number AOs in sequential order, starting with number one for each fiscal year.
      Cite, above the heading of the first order of a year, the number of the last order published
      the previous year. For example: "FY06. Last AO was #2140."
          A3.3.1.1.1. A record set of AOs contains all orders published during a fiscal year, to
          include regular, amendment and revocation orders. Each order number must be
          accounted for (log required), from the first order through the last order published for
          that fiscal year. Multiple logs and numbers (with letters added) are not authorized.
132                                      AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


          A3.3.1.1.1. (AETC) Maintain a paper copy log of all AOs published. Include name,
          grade, date accomplished, effective date of order, and reason for order.
          A3.3.1.1.2. A separate file of background material (from official sources) which
          supports each order‘s publication must be maintained for each fiscal year IAW
          AFMAN 37-123. Annotate (in ink) the background material in the lower right-hand
          corner (bottom margin of page) to show the order number to which it pertains. For
          example: ―Supporting document (or background material) for AO # 0469, dated 15
          Dec 2005.‖
              A3.3.1.1.2.1. Source documents include information from personnel database
              interfaces, military identification cards, finance system documents, re-enlistment
              papers, etc. Do not use documents that transferred dates or information from one
              source document to another—use the source. If using information logged on a
              member‘s in-processing or out-processing checklist, for example DDLDS or
              Effective Date of Duty to process AOs, the HARM office will request a MILPDS
              interface and validate the data for processing the AO.
          A3.3.1.1.3. Post each amendment AO to the HARM office record set and FRF/JRF.
          Post revocation AOs to the HARM office record set only. Enter an explanation in ink
          on the left margin of the original order. For example: "Revoked by AO #2424, dated
          18 Sep 05."
      A3.3.1.2. Confirm verbal orders (in writing) within three duty-days. Include in the
      written order the date and by whom the verbal order was issued and, if flying/jump status
      or aeronautical ratings/badges were affected, a statement why written orders were not
      issued earlier. For example, "The verbal orders of the commander on (date) are
      confirmed; circumstances prevented written orders in advance."
   A3.3.2. Unit commanders will notify the HARM office to request aviation or parachutist
   service actions that originate at the unit level. For example: Initiating aviation/parachutist
   service, non-interference flying, or operational support requests.
   A3.3.3. The host base Information Management (IM) office will provide reproduction
   facilities for publishing AOs when facilities are not available within the HARM office.
   A3.3.4. HARM offices may publish a single aeronautical order affecting several members
   providing the action is exactly the same for each member. For group orders, mask
   information protected under the Privacy Act of 1974 (SSNs) to prevent unauthorized
   disclosure.
   A3.3.5. A single AO may be published directing several actions that pertain to an individual,
   provided all actions have the same effective and termination dates. EXCEPTION: AOs
   awarding basic or advanced aeronautical ratings or badges do not contain other actions.
   A3.3.6. Use AF Form 1887 or ARMS AO to amend or revoke a previous AO.
      A3.3.6.1. Amend AOs to correct minor administrative errors (erroneous SSN, improper
      grade, termination date, misspelled name, etc.), if the intent of the original order is
      unaffected by the correction. The amendment order should contain the original effective
      date and only other required identifying data (name, grade, SSN, and organization) and
      the amended data. If other personal data is the same as the AO being amended (ASD,
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                   133


     ASC, FAC, etc..), it may also be included on the AO. Underline amended items and
     reference the amended item(s) in the AO remarks.(An amendment makes the
     amended order read as it should have initially.) An AF Form 1887 is the recommended
     medium for amending AO because, as an automated system, ARMS automatically
     includes current information that may not be applicable for the effective period of the AO
     being amended. This information may be included if it mirrors the AO being amended.
     Use of AF Form 1887 avoids HARM system "work-arounds" that entail entering false
     date into ARMS. False data may interface with other Air Force systems and corrupt
     promotion or assignment processes.
        A3.3.6.1.1. HARM offices may use a single amendment AO to correct erroneous
        data on more than one AO if the data to be changed is the same on each incorrect
        AO.EXAMPLE:A HARM office does not amend the ASD and termination date on
        AOs following an ASD adjustment. This may be corrected by publishing one AO to
        correct the ASD and termination date and listing each AO number that required
        correction in the remarks section of the amendment AO.
        A3.3.6.1.2. Do not publish an amendment order to another amendment order. Revoke
        the incorrect amendment and publish a single correct amendment.
        A3.3.6.1.3. Amending a termination date is authorized, except on an AO published to
        change a termination date. In this case, the AO‘s intent was incorrect from the
        beginning. When amending an AO, document in ink the AO number and request date
        of the amendment AO on the lower left-hand margin of the original AO in the record
        set and FRF being amended. For example: ―Amended by AO #13, dated 13 Oct 05.‖
        A3.3.6.1.4. HARM offices will not amend an AO to correct an effective date. Since
        the intent of a published AO is that the AO is valid from the beginning (effective
        date), an incorrect AO effective date invalidates that AO from the beginning. HARM
        offices must revoke the AO and publish a new AO with the correct effective date and
        the required aviation service change.
        A3.3.6.1.5. (Added) . HARM offices will not amend an AO to correct an erroneous
        OFDA total or FAC unless the AO was published to mark an aviation service point,
        e.g. 12 years of aviation service, or to assign FAC 6/E, respectively.
        A3.3.6.1.6. (Added) . HARM offices will not amend a past AO solely to correct an
        erroneous authority paragraph reference. The authority paragraph reference must be
        correct on the member‘s current AO.
     A3.3.6.2. Do not rescind AOs. Action taken on a later AO supersedes only the same item
     on previous orders. Previously awarded items on an order maintain the same effective
     date. Example: MSgt Jones", (ASC 9D) aeronautical order (AO) will terminate 27
     December 2005. However, MSgt Jones reenlists on 15 Dec 2005, and will remain on
     active flying status. An AO must be printed to reflect the new termination date based on
     the new DOS; the effective date of the new AO will remain the same as the original AO
     that placed MSgt Jones on flying status.
     A3.3.6.3. Revoke an order when it is void and without effect from the beginning. (A
     revocation deletes the order from the chronological history in the member‘s FRF or JRF.)
     However, the revoked AO must be filed with the record set background material of AOs
134                                     AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


       to support the AO being published. When an AO is revoked, it no longer exists as an
       official document. Do not revoke a revocation; instead, publish a new order. For
       Example: When the HARM office publishes AO #2424 to revoke AO #444. Remove AO
       #444 from the FRF and file AO #2424 in the HARM office record set. Document
       revoked information on the lower left-hand side margin of revoked AO. For Example:
       Revoked by AO #167, dated 18 Jan 03. HARM offices must send a copy of both AOs to
       the member and AFPC/DPAOY. AFPC/DPAOY maintains a permanent file in member‘s
       historical file to show all aviation service actions processed.
A3.4. Restrictions on Publication.
   A3.4.1. Do not publish an AO to authorize Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) or Air
   National Guard (ANG) personnel to take part in flight activity during short periods of
   EAD.EXCEPTION:AOs will be published for AFRC and ANG personnel while attending
   the Flight Screening Program.
   A3.4.2. The AO effective date will not precede the date the member met all eligibility
   requirements.
   A3.4.3. Prior to publication of an AO that will involuntarily terminate aviation service for
   non-CEA enlisted aircrew members, the HARM office must ensure the member was given a
   120-day notification before removal from aviation service (IAW AFI 11-402). Receipt of
   assignment notification documentation from the MPF, as directed by AFI 36-2102,Base-
   Level Relocation Procedures, verbal orders of the member‘s unit commander (written
   confirmation must be received within three duty-days), or any official documentation
   received from AF/A3O-AT constitutes certification and will be noted in remarks of the
   published order. Place MPFs on distribution for all such AOs.
   A3.4.4. AOs should not be published later than the effective date if the action changes,
   initiates, or terminates incentive pay entitlement or OFDA, unless:
       A3.4.4.1. The AO confirms an ASC change as a result of PCS. In this case, the effective
       date is the day after the member signs out from the losing organization, as provided by
       the MPF. A retroactive statement is not necessary for this action. HARM offices will
       verify DDLDS documented on the member‘s in-processing sheet with MILPDS data.
       A3.4.4.2. The AO involves circumstances where a directive establishes an effective date
       of AO. Cite the governing directive that applies as authority.

                       date of the order (item 18). An aviation service period is initiated for
                       rated officers and CEAs on entry into flying training that leads to an
                       aeronautical rating or badge and at each subsequent aviation career phase
                       point (10, 12, 15, 18, and 20 years aviation service).

                 ARMS AIRCREW/MISSION FLIGHT DATA EXTRACT

A4.1. Purpose. The AF Form 3520 is the source document for recording and reporting flight
training and space shuttle/space station information for each individual authorized to take part in
missions. This form is primarily used for aircrew members attending qualification school or
aircrew logging space time. Aircrew who fly operational missions off-station will use/make an
exact copy of the original AFTO Form 781, certify this as a true extract, and turn in the
form/copy to their HARM or SARM office for updating in ARMS. This is an official record to
validate flight pay eligibility for rated, CEA, and other non-rated officer and enlisted members
required to fly while TDY. This form will not be used for flights involving combat/combat
support operations. The original AF Form 3520,ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Extract,
must be maintained in the HARM office that services the unit to which the member is assigned.
This form is available for downloading on the e-publishing website atwww.e-publishing.af.mil.
A4.2. Scope. The instructions listed on the reverse side of the AF Form 3520 apply to all rated,
CEA, and other non-rated officer and enlisted members authorized to log flight time while
attending training to attain qualification in an aircraft or training device and to log authorized
flights in non-USAF aircraft (includes space shuttle and space station) for the purpose of
maintaining an official Air Force Individual Flight Record. Source documents used to transfer
flight data from non-USAF aircraft are maintained as source documents IAW AFMAN 37-139.
A4.3. Responsibilities. SARM/HARM office personnel are responsible for distributing and
collecting these forms. Completing the AF Form 3520 is a responsibility of the aircrew member.

    INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING AF FORM 4327, ARMS FIGHTER FLIGHT
AUTHORIZATION, AND AF FORM 4327A, CREW FLIGHT AUTHORIZATION (FA)

A5.1. Purpose. Unit commanders will use the AF Forms 4327 and 4327a to authorize the use
of USAF aircraft to perform a specific mission(s), and to authorize aircrew members required to
perform in-flight duties. Use the AF Form 4327 to authorize flights of utility, fighter, and trainer
aircraft for missions that originate and end at the same location. Use the AF Form 4327a to
authorize all other aircraft missions and for fighters/trainers (if desired). These are critical
documents used during mission review to validate duties performed/logged on the AFTO Form
781, and for reimbursement of temporary duty expenses. Forms are available for downloading on
the e-publishing website atwww.e-publishing.af.mil.
   A5.1.1. Additional members authorized to fly, who are not required to perform aircrew
   duties (except for noninterference fliers, and MEP when specifically authorized [see
   paragraph A5.1.3]) must be listed on a passenger manifest.
   A5.1.2. The FA accounts for aircrew personnel required/authorized to perform in-flight
   aircrew duties and the passenger manifest lists all additional members approved to fly on the
   aircraft, but not performing specific aircrew duties on that mission. MEP and non-
   interference fliers not on AOs may be listed on the FA, in the Remarks section; if not listed
   on the FA, these individuals will be placed on the passenger manifest. The FA and passenger
   manifest combined account for all personnel on the aircraft.
   A5.1.3. Units may use computer-generated programs to produce AF Forms 4327/4327a in
   lieu of the actual form program. If used, computer-generated forms must duplicate AF forms
   located at the AFDPO e-publishing web site.
A5.2. Scope. These instructions apply to all flying unit commanders with operational control of
USAF aircraft who direct the use of aircraft and aircrews in support of command operations; and
AE, pararescue unit and ANG Senior Scout unit commanders who publish AE/PJ/Senior Scout
flight authorizations for aircrew members assigned to their units who are required to perform
aircrew duties on the mission.
A5.3. Responsibilities. AF Forms 4327 and 4327a are established by this instruction. Aviation
Resource Management personnel are responsible for publication of these forms and performing
Go/No-Go validation (review of ARMS products and member‘s AOs) during pre-mission
review.
   A5.3.1. When additional aircrew members are added after completion of the FA, the
   authenticating official, pilot in command, or flight lead must confirm Go/No-Go
   requirements are accomplished by validating ARMS training products and AOs prior to
   flight.
   A5.3.2. The completed FA and the AFTO Form 781 will be used during post mission review
   to ensure proper documentation and accounting for all aircrew members authorized to
   perform duties. The pilot in command will document deviations between scheduled duties on
   the FA (Duty Position) and actual duties performed in the remarks of the AFTO Form 781.
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                      145


   A5.3.3. The completed FA is normally filed with other mission paperwork. The Air Force
   Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)lists the minimum disposition requirements of this form.
   MAJCOM supplements may require longer retention times for the form.
   A5.3.3. (AETC) Keep a signed copy of the flight authorization (FA) on file in the squadron
   during flight operations. If administrative constraints exist (high volume of sorties flown and
   excessive deviations to the daily schedule), UFT units may use a signed working copy of the
   FA. UFT units will reprint the FA with changes and have a designated approving official
   sign. Units will ensure both copies are filed together. Note: Each unit will sign AF IMT
   4327, ARMS Fighter Flight Authorization, and AF IMT 4327a, Crew Flight (FA)
   Authorization.

flight authorizations match the aircraft‘s flight authorization for that specific mission.
3. As a minimum, AE/PJ/Senior Scout flight authorizations must contain information in blocks
11-18.
4. The pilot in command must validate all aircrew members listed on the flight authorization(s),
including AE/PJ/Senior Scout aircrew members, are required to perform aircrew duties or are
required to perform specific tasks (non-interference flyers on AOs) by initialing in Block 16.
5. AE/PJ/Senior Scout flight authorizations must be filed with the aircraft flight authorization
(mission paperwork) that they performed specific in-flight aircrew duties on.

AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                        151


 Submit a request for approval and waiver.
 4. Off-home station missions must not be flown in lieu of travel for personal reasons, while
 TDY, or on leave status. The perception of personal travel must be avoided.
A7.2. (Added-AETC) Instructor Enrichment Program (IEP) Purpose. The IEP is an
observation-flying program designed to familiarize AETC instructors with missions performed
by AETC instructors who fly different weapons systems. An IEP sortie may be used to
familiarize supervisor of flying (SOF) personnel with mission and performance of different
aircraft in the traffic pattern. Knowledge gained is expected to allow SOF personnel to make
more informed decisions during critical situations, such as emergency recoveries.
   A7.2.1. (Added-AETC) Foreign Aircrew Members. Unless otherwise stipulated in an
   MOA or memorandum of understanding (MOU), foreign aircrew members assigned to
   AETC units, including officer exchange program personnel and ENJJPT IPs, are eligible to
   participate in IEP. IEP flights for foreign aircrew members in other than their primary aircraft
   must be reviewed for foreign disclosure requirements, according to AFI 16-201, Air Force
   Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program.
   A7.2.2. (Added-AETC) IEP Qualifications:
       A7.2.2.1. (Added-AETC) The squadron            commander      will   ensure   only   highly
       experienced IPs give the IEP sortie.
       A7.2.2.2. (Added-AETC) The IEP candidate receiving the sortie must be an AETC
       instructor currently qualified in an AETC aircraft and on current AOs. Exception: Phase
       III SUPT graduates and USN personnel assigned as JSUPT instructors programmed to
       attend T-6 PIT may use this program to gain recent familiarization in the T-6. These
       candidates must be on current AOs.
       A7.2.2.3. (Added-AETC) The IEP candidate will receive physiological training for the
       intended aircraft profile, according to AFI 11-403.
       A7.2.2.4. (Added-AETC) The IEP candidate will receive egress and AFE training
       appropriate to the aircraft being flown, according to AFI 11-301, Volume 1, and its
       AETC supplement.
   A7.2.3. (Added-AETC) IEP Restrictions:
       A7.2.3.1. (Added-AETC) The IEP candidate will fly only in an aircraft that has an
       equivalent crew position that the IEP candidate currently holds (e.g., flight engineers may
       fly only in AETC aircraft with flight engineer crew positions; combat system officers
       may fly only in AETC aircraft with combat system officers positions, etc.). Exceptions:
          A7.2.3.1.1. (Added-AETC) Rated SOF personnel may fly in all AETC aircraft
          assigned to their unit to gain familiarization with the mission and the performance of
          different aircraft in the traffic pattern.
          A7.2.3.1.2. (Added-AETC) KC-135 boom operators at the FTUs may participate in
          the IEP program regardless of the presence of an equivalent position in the IEP
          aircraft, but they must abide by requirements in A7.2.3.1.2.1 (Added) through
          A7.2.3.1.2.4 (Added).
              A7.2.3.1.2.1. (Added-AETC) The boom operator must be in the 97 OG faculty
152                                     AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


             development program.
             A7.2.3.1.2.2. (Added-AETC) Only one IEP sortie is authorized and it must be
             flown on a 97th Air Mobility Wing (97 AMW) aircraft with a 97 AMW-based
             instructor crew.
             A7.2.3.1.2.3. (AETC) The sortie must include air refueling.
             A7.2.3.1.2.4. (AETC) Scheduling and execution must comply with this
             supplement.
      A7.2.3.2. (Added-AETC) IEP sorties may be flown on local or off-station missions.
      The minimum crew complement, as prescribed by governing aircraft and manpower
      instructions, does not include IEP candidates. The primary crew must be current and
      qualified, or attaining or maintaining aircraft qualification under instructor supervision.
      A7.2.3.3. (Added-AETC) Under the IEP program, only IEP pilot candidates may fly at
      a set of aircraft controls. Passengers are not permitted on board when an IEP pilot
      candidate is at a set of aircraft controls.
      A7.2.3.4. (Added-AETC) A student pilot may occupy a pilot seat with a set of controls
      while an IEP candidate is on board the aircraft. The student pilot is under the direct
      supervision of an IP, who will be at the other set of controls.
      A7.2.3.5. (Added-AETC) Only IEP pilot candidates may fly in ejection-seat aircraft or
      in one of the designated pilot seats. The IEP pilot candidate may be given control of the
      aircraft if he or she has completed an OG/CC-approved training program. If a simulator is
      available at the base where the sortie is flown, the program will include the IEP candidate
      completing one simulator sortie for the type of aircraft to be flown (minimum .5 duration)
      with emphasis on switchology, control actuations, flight characteristics, egress,
      cockpit/crew resource management (CRM), and application of boldface emergency
      procedures. Units will develop local procedures to document training. Reaccomplish all
      training if the sortie is not completed within 30 days. This approval will allow the IEP
      candidate to fly during all phases of flight under IP supervision and when the IP occupies
      the other pilot seat. Waiver authority is NAF/CC. Exception: AETC C-21 IEP pilot
      candidates at Keesler AFB and IEP pilot candidates at Altus AFB scheduled to fly in
      Randolph AFB T-1 TDY aircraft are not required to complete the simulator sortie
      requirement.
         A7.2.3.5.1. (Added-AETC) If a simulator is not available, the MDS IP will
         thoroughly brief all of the items identified in paragraph A7.2.3.5 to the IEP pilot
         candidate, and the IEP candidate will not control the aircraft during critical phases of
         flight as defined by the MDS Volume 3. The owning MDS OG/CC is the waiver
         authority for this paragraph.
         A7.2.3.5.2. (Added-AETC) Prior to the flight, the MDS IP will mission brief the
         IEP candidate. The mission briefing will include applicable portions of Attachment 9
         (Added). The IP will occupy the front seat in the F-15, F-16, T-38, and T-6; left seat
         in the C-5, C-130, KC-135, T-37; right seat in the CV-22, UH-1N, HH-60, and MH-
         53; and either seat in the T-1, C-17, and C-21. The IEP candidate will not perform
AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010                                                        153


           touch-and-go landings from a back seat without a NAF/CC waiver. Only one IP is
           required for these flights.
           A7.2.3.5.3. (Added-AETC) The minimum crew for a UH-1N helicopter is the

       33-360, to address local operations resource management issues.
   A7.2.4. (Added-AETC) IEP Approval Authority. The OG/CC is the approval authority
   for IEP sorties. The SQ/CC is the selection authority for wing personnel, and will forward the
   IEP candidate nomination to the OG/CC. For nonunit-assigned personnel, the IEP
   candidate‘s OG/CC will forward the IEP candidate nomination to the appropriate OG/CC for
   approval. IEP sorties will be coordinated between units in advance and should not interfere
   with student training. Units will develop local procedures for all IEP requests.
   A7.2.5. (Added-AETC) IEP Logging Flight Time. The IEP guest instructor will:
       A7.2.5.1. (Added-AETC) Log ―X_‖ or ―O_‖ (depending on the member‘s grade),

       A7.12.2.1. (Added-AETC) WG/CCs may approve spouse orientation flights in
       nonejection-seat aircraft only. Spouses may not fly orientation flights in ejection-seat
       aircraft.
       A7.12.2.2. (Added-AETC) Normally, this program is for assigned instructors‘ spouses.
       Spouses of unit critical specialty members, active duty maintenance personnel who
       directly support the flying mission, and student aircrew may participate (in that order of
       priority) on a space-available basis. Note: Units must coordinate with the local FSS or
       the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) for a list of current ―critical specialty‖ skills. This
       will be used to document eligibility.
160                                     AFI11-401_AETCSUP_94AWSUP_I 1 APRIL 2010


      A7.12.2.3. (Added-AETC) A spouse is usually limited to one orientation flight during
      the sponsor‘s tour but may be granted additional flights with OG/CC coordination and
      WG/CC approval. Note: The AETC Form 327 may be used for unit documentation but is
      not required at HHQ.
      A7.12.2.4. (Added-AETC) A spouse will not fly in the same aircraft as his or her
      sponsor.
      A7.12.2.5. (Added-AETC) The SQ/CC (or equivalent) will select only highly qualified
      instructors or mission qualified crewmembers to conduct these flights.
      A7.12.2.6. (Added-AETC) Spouses should be given a wing mission briefing before
      flight. In addition, they will be fully briefed using an MDS-specific passenger briefing
      guide or the orientation flight and generalized passenger briefing guide. See Attachment
      9 (Added).
      A7.12.2.7. (Added-AETC) Orientation flights will be conducted on a round-robin route
      that originates and terminates at the departure base with no intermediate stops.
      Orientation flights on air-refueling sorties are authorized. A low-level flight or wingtip
      formation is strictly forbidden with spouses on board.
      A7.12.2.8. (Added-AETC) Training maneuvers will be restricted according to TO
      guidance for passenger-carrying missions. Aerobatics, stalls, or emergency procedures
      are strictly forbidden.

      taxi rides. Normally, only assigned instructors‘ spouses are allowed taxi rides in the T-1,
      T-6, T-37, T-38, F-15, and F-16. Spouses of unit critical specialty members who directly
      support the flying mission and spouses of student aircrew may participate (in that order of
      priority) on a space-available basis. (Note: OG/CCs will coordinate with the local FSS or
      AFPC for a list of current ―critical specialty‖ skills.) A spouse is usually limited to one
      taxi ride during the sponsor‘s tour but may be granted more than one taxi ride with
      OG/CC coordination and WG/CC approval. Note: The AETC Form 327 may be used for
      unit documentation but is not required at HHQ.
      A7.12.3.2. (Added-AETC) This program demands careful planning and execution.
      Safety is paramount, and everyone involved must comply with all restrictions, adhere to
      requirements, and use common sense. These are taxi rides only. No acceptable reason
      exists for an instructor to become airborne with a spouse on board.
      A7.12.3.3. (Added-AETC) Develop local procedures according to AFI 33-360. Ensure:
         A7.12.3.3.1. (Added-AETC) All participants receive hands-on ground egress
         training (to include emergency ground egress) and AFE briefing, according to AFI

          rides. They will taxi from the left or front seat and may taxi their own spouse. T-6
          participants will be strapped in, using normal procedures.
          A7.12.3.3.5. (Added-AETC) Escort officers are available to accompany spouses to
          the aircraft, assist with strapping in and deplaning, and escort the spouse back off the
          flight line.
          A7.12.3.3.6. (Added-AETC) Normal assigned call signs are used.
          A7.12.3.3.7. (Added-AETC) Normal routes and taxi speeds are used. Accelerate to
          1,000 feet down the runway or 50 knots maximum for the T-1, T-37, and F-16; 70
          knots maximum for the T-6; and 90 knots maximum for the T-38 or F-15, whichever
          comes first. Leave the nose wheel on the ground at all times. Use the brakes sparingly
          to prevent heat buildup. Taxi to the end of the runway; do not turn off early.
          A7.12.3.3.8. (Added-AETC) Comply with normal checklist procedures. Exceptions
          include:
              A7.12.3.3.8.1. (Added-AETC) For T-37 and T-38 taxi rides, do not strap
              participants into the parachute; instead, use it as a backrest. Use the gold key on
              the oxygen supply hose to secure the lap belt, not the gold key on the parachute.
              Do not insert the CRU-60/P into the CRU-60/P block on the parachute; instead,
              rest it in the participant‘s lap. Ensure ejection-seat arming handle safety pins
              remain installed throughout the taxi ride.
              A7.12.3.3.8.2. (Added-AETC) Do not remove seat or canopy pins. They must
