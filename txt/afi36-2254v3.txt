AFI36-2254V3 18 JUNE 2010                                                                      3



                                           Chapter 1

                                    TELECOMMUTING

1.1. Background.
   1.1.1. Telecommuting is a management tool that allows the United States Air Force (USAF)
   to authorize reservists to work/train away from their official duty location. Telecommuting is
   a complementary way of doing business, which moves work and training to the people
   instead of moving the people to the work or training. In general, it means working/training
   from an alternate location away from the official duty location. The most common
   technologies used for telecommuting are the telephone, facsimile, computer, and modem.
   1.1.2. The approval authority should grant telecommuting only when it is in the best interest
   of the Air Force. Telecommuting is a privilege and not a right for the reservist. Do not
   authorize travel in connection with this type of duty.
   1.1.3. This instruction requires that participants use a pre-authorized agreement for
   accountability. Attachment 2 shows a sample agreement.
1.2. Definition. Telecommuting allows written pre-authorization by Reserve unit commanders
or Readiness Management Group (RMG) program managers (PMs) to allow reservists to
work/train in an official capacity for pay and/or points away from the official duty location in
either annual tour or active duty (AD) for Operational Support, or inactive duty training (IDT)
status. The alternate work locations must have the necessary tools and environment to enable
reservists to accomplish assigned duties. All data, documents, or products developed are the sole
property of the United States (US) Government and will be prepared for filing in accordance
with command guidance if it is to be a permanent record.
1.3. Percentage of Use. The approval authority and the supervisor determine the percentage of
telecommuting work for an individual reservist. Under no circumstances should a reservist
perform all their duty by telecommuting. It is the intent that every reservist participate in a
military environment by performing duty in uniform at their official duty location.
1.4. Roles and Responsibilities.
   1.4.1. The RMG PM or the Numbered Air Force/wing/group commander (or their designees)
   are approval authorities for telecommuting and work agreements.
   1.4.2. The immediate AD or Reserve supervisor is responsible for:
       1.4.2.1. Recommending the telecommuting project to the approval authority.
       1.4.2.2. Preparing required documentation and obtaining any necessary signatures from
       the telecommuter.
       1.4.2.3. Ensuring project details (e.g., scope of work, deliverables, etc.) are mutually
       agreed upon before beginning work.
       1.4.2.4. Quality control of the telecommuter‘s completed product.
       1.4.2.5. Maintaining the original approved agreement, and giving a copy to the reservist.
 4                                                                AFI36-2254V3 18 JUNE 2010


     1.4.3. The commander is responsible for approving the use of Government owned equipment
     and related supplies for use by the telecommuter. The decision to use appropriated funds to
     pay for equipment, services, or supplies for the purposes of telecommuting, rests solely with
     the commander (AFI 33-112, Information Technology Hardware Asset Management.)
1.5. Dual Compensation for Federal Employees.
     1.5.1. Many reservists also hold separate positions as Federal civilian employees. After
     civilian duty hours, telecommuting as a reservist to perform IDT should ordinarily be
     compatible with such employment. However, performing consecutive days of AD, even if
     such duty transpires after the completion of the civilian workday, will result in a full
     workday‘s charge to leave from the Federal civilian position.
     1.5.2. Military leave, annual leave, leave without pay, accrued compensatory time off, or
     accrued credit hours may be used to cover the civilian work hours.
1.6. Safety. Telecommuters are responsible for ensuring that alternate work locations are safe
environments. The reservist will report any injuries while telecommuting to their supervisor as
soon as possible. The supervisor will follow Line of Duty reporting procedures for accidents or
injuries.
1.7. General Obligations.
     1.7.1. Reservists are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) while
     telecommuting (see Title 10 U.S.C., Section 802(a)(3); AFI 51-201, Administration of
     Military Justice, paragraph 2.8). The period of military jurisdiction coincides with the duty
     hours specified in applicable AD orders, or the inactive duty hours reflected on the AF Form
     40A, Record of Individual Inactive Duty Training.
     1.7.2. Members must meet requirements outlined in AFI 36-22XX, Volume I, Reserve
     Personnel Participation, in order to telecommute.
     1.7.3. Reservists are responsible for providing telecommuting equipment requirements to the
     supervisor.
     1.7.4. Reservists should obtain the approval authority‘s concurrence before performing
     telecommuting that exceeds the agreed hours.
     1.7.5. The approval authority of the telecommuting agreement may terminate participation in
     telecommuting at any time.
     1.7.6. Members should not use telecommuting for formal training purposes. However, IDT
     credit is permissible if telecommuting is used to satisfy sustainment or supplemental types of
     activities typically satisfied in an IDT status. Enlisted members may not engage in
     telecommuting on projects within their Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) area unless they
     are in training status code D or R. Officers must have a Qualified level AFSC (i.e., 33S3 or
     37P4 not 37P1) to telecommute on projects in their AFSC area. Projects unrelated to AFSC
     areas may be approved if the supervisor knows the member to be capable of completing the
     project.
1.8. Funding.
     1.8.1. The approval authority will not authorize travel or per diem for telecommuting.
AFI36-2254V3 18 JUNE 2010                                                                   5


   1.8.2. Before beginning a project, approval authorities may authorize reimbursement for
   incidental and minor out-of-pocket expenses, (e.g., postage, long distance telephone calls,
   consumable supplies). They should include a statement in the telecommuting agreement
   allowing the reservist to use the Standard Form (SF) 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for
   Expenditures on Official Business. The normal procedures and dollar limits associated with
   the SF 1164 apply.
1.9. Agreement.
   1.9.1. The reservist and supervisor should sign an agreement before starting the
   telecommuting project specifying all terms for the project and before receiving approval
   authority‘s signature.
   1.9.2. The approval authority may authorize a general agreement for the performance of
   telecommuting projects in 4 hour increments. However, before each project, the approval
   authority should document specified project details (e.g., scope of work/training,
   deliverables, project completion times, type of participation, resource requirements,
   reimbursable expenses, and progress report requirements).
      1.9.2.1. The approval authority must require the reservist to sign a separate assignment
      report, or an addendum to the agreement, acknowledging receipt and understanding of
      project details.
      1.9.2.2. The approval authority must give a copy of the agreement, with any addendum
      or assignment reports, to the reservist and supervisor.
      1.9.2.3. Approval authorities must maintain and dispose of this agreement according to
      AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel Records System.

   commander must notify the Equipment Control Officer of the relocation of the equipment
   (AFI 33-112).
   1.10.3. Government equipment is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO). Commanders may
   authorize installation, repair, and/or maintenance of equipment at their discretion and
   direction. The equipment is for authorized use by the reservist only.
   1.10.4. The reservist agrees to protect any government-owned equipment from damage, loss,

                         ADVANCED DISTRIBUTED LEARNING

2.1. Definition of Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL). ADL is defined as structured
learning that takes place without the physical presence of the instructor but may require
mentors/facilitators to be physically present. ADL is enhanced with technology, which may
include the use of one or more of the following media – correspondence course materials,
audio/videotapes, CD-ROMs, audio/video tele-training, interactive television, web based
instruction, and video conferencing.
2.2. Currently, ADL is confined to members in duty status or enrolled in Air Force Institute for
Advanced Distributed Learning courses. Members will only receive credit and compensation for
successful completion of ADL courses. Points received for successful completion of ADL
courses is considered compensation by DoD.
   2.2.1. An officer will not earn points in a course specified for enlisted members. Enlisted
   members will not earn points in a course specified for officers.
   2.2.2. Reserve members who complete developmental eduction (DE) via ADL must register
   for the course through an Air Force Military Education and Training Office in order to
   receive point credit. Air Force Reserve members are authorized to complete other service
   DE via ADL after first completing the comparable level of Air Force DE. Members are not
   authorized to enroll directly with other service schools offering DE, and any DE completed
   by using such means will not be creditable for points.
