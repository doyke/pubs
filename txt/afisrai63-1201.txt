SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision incorporates revisions to the organizational identifications and minor content changes.


1. Policy:
   1.1. The MFT Process. The MFT is a customer-focused team composed of stakeholders in the acqui-
   sition and is responsible for the acquisition throughout the life of the requirement. The MFT performs
   actions that may include but are not limited to:
       1.1.1. Providing support to AF senior leadership.
       1.1.2. Promoting business decisions to meet customer requirements.
       1.1.3. Researching the commercial market for acquisition solutions.
       1.1.4. Fostering partnerships with industry to enable exchanges of information.
       1.1.5. Developing a performance based acquisition strategy/
       1.1.6. Managing risk especially for cost and schedule constraints
2                                                              AFISRAI63-1201 29 NOVEMBER 2007


       1.1.7. Developing PBSA requirements.
       1.1.8. Planning financial resources for upcoming acquisitions and managing funding milestones.
       1.1.9. Developing technical requirement and independent cost/government estimate.
       1.1.10. Developing source selection factors and sub-factors.
       1.1.11. Assessing and documenting contractor performance IAW the performance plan.
       1.1.12. Managing contract performance IAW the performance plan.
       1.1.13. Identifying opportunities to improve performance throughout the life of the contract.
       1.1.14. Assessing/managing contractor performance assessment data (including Contractor
       1.1.15. Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).
       1.1.16. Performing annual performance reviews IAW Management and Oversight of Acquisition
       of Services Process (MOASP) policy.
    1.2. When requested, the AF ISR Agency Contracts Review Committee will assist the contracting
    officer (CO) in initiating the MFT process for each requirement. AF ISR Agency units receiving sup-
    port from other than AF ISR Agency/A7K should check with their contract support office to deter-
    mine procedures that apply for their acquisition.
    1.3. Acquisitions for Which a MFT is Required. AFI 63-124 requires that service requirements with
    an estimated value in excess of $100,000 will establish a MFT unless exempted by the criteria in FAR
    37.102(a)(1). The CO will determine whether a formal MFT should be established for any task orders
    or contracts under $100,000.

2. Procedures.
    2.1. The AF ISR Agency/A4/7 Director designates the following personnel as mandatory participants
    in AF ISR Agency MFTs: the Contracting Officer, the buyer/contract administrator, Contracts Com-
    mittee representative, Contracting Quality Assurance Program Coordinator (QAPC), Quality Assur-
    ance Personnel (QAP), and Project manager or QAPs supervisor. Other optional participants will
    participate at the direction of the MFT facilitator and may include: small business representative,
    acquisition support team representative, resource advisor or Finance rep, and Staff Judge Advocate’s
    representative, Security Office representative, price analyst, DCMA ACO.
    2.2. AF ISR Agency/A7K Tracking and Coordination. AF ISR Agency/A7K Contracting Officers
    monitor contract expiration and schedule initial MFT meetings in sufficient time to avoid breaks in
    service. The branch chief will report overdue MFTs to the AF ISR Agency/A7K Division Chief at
    monthly "How Goes It" meetings.
    2.3. Contracting Officer. The CO facilitates the MFT meetings. The CO is responsible for ensuring
    that minutes documenting the results of the MFT are taken. The CO will distribute minutes and place
    a copy of the minutes in the official contract file no later than 5 working days after the initial MFT and
    acquisition strategy meetings. The CO will update the Contract Actions Database (CADB) to reflect
    current acquisition status.
    2.4. Buyer/Administrator. The buyer/administrator shall participate in all MFT meetings. The buyer/
    administrator will assist the CO in documenting the minutes during each meeting.
AFISRAI63-1201 29 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                      3


  2.5. MFT Meetings. The MFT will conduct at least an initial MFT meeting and an Acquisition Strat-
  egy meeting for each acquisition. Additional meetings may be scheduled prior to award as determined
  by the CO. The CO documents attendance, establishes a Milestone Schedule (Attachment 1 for major
  contracts or Attachment 2 for task orders), and completes the minutes. The MFT may be set up to
  support a single function or multiple functions. At the discretion of the CO and upon approval of the
  branch chief, the MFT meetings may be conducted using electronic or E-mail communication. Other
  meetings of the MFT may be called after award as shown in paragraph 2.5.3. below.
     2.5.1. Initial MFT Meeting. The initial MFT meeting begins the planning process for all acquisi-
     tions subject to AFI 63-124. The MFT checklist at Attachment 3 will be used to ensure all rele-
     vant issues are addressed. This meeting should be conducted no later than 12 months prior (for
     major contracts) and 5 months prior (for task orders) to the required date for the new acquisition
     and will normally include all members of the team. Two weeks prior to the MFT meeting, AF ISR
     Agency/A7K will send a letter (Attachment 5) or electronic message to the functional Com-
     mander/Director and the QAP notifying them of the scheduled MFT meeting. Mandatory attend-
     ees at the meeting are the CO, buyer/contract administrator, QAP, Project manager or QAP
     supervisor, representative from the contracts review committee, and QAPC. Other suggested par-
     ticipants, may include the small business specialist, the acquisition branch chief, price analyst,
     functional Commander/Director, requirements support or contracts management office personnel,
     JA, FM, SO, and the DCMA ACO.
     2.5.2. Acquisition Strategy Meeting (ASM). The ASM should occur no later than 3 months after
     the initial MFT meeting for major contracts and no later than 2 months after the initial MFT for
     task orders. Prior to the ASM, the CO will send a letter (Attachment 6) to the customer notifying
     them of the scheduled ASM meeting. The ASM will focus on finalizing the customer submitted
     documents. To assist in accomplishing this goal an ASM checklist has been developed (Attach-
     ment 4). The CO will conduct the meeting with the requiring activity no later than 3 weeks after
     the requiring activity submits all required documents. The CO will convey and discuss all neces-
     sary corrections and revisions to the customer submitted documents and confirm or revise the pre-
     viously established suspense for final submission of all final documents. The Performance Plan
     will be signed by all team members. The CO will distribute minutes and place a copy of the min-
     utes in the contract file no later than 5 working days after the ASM meeting.
     2.5.3. Follow-on MFT Meetings. Follow-on meetings will be called as necessary to resolve post
     award issues that require the team’s input. The CO will determine the need for these post award
     meetings. The CO will also determine if it is necessary that JA, FM, SO and others should attend.
     The CO will document each meeting, distribute documents of each meeting to all mandatory MFT
     participants, and maintain documentation in the Official Contract File.
