                                          SYSTEM SUMMARY

2.1. System Application. The function of D072 is to compute OWRMRs for budget code "9" items.
These represent items used by the Air Force but are managed by other DoD services/agencies. Computed
Air Force requirements are provided to the non-Air Force ICPs of their DoD services/agencies to include
in their budgetary requirements. Items are individually computed by dividing 2 years of peacetime
demand by 24 to obtain an AMD. Factors are obtained by comparing six months of peacetime flying
hours to six months of wartime flying hours from the budget year (three years in the future). The AMD is
multiplied by six wartime factors to provide six monthly figures for the first six months of wartime. After
arriving at the six-month figures, subtract prepositioned quantity from the first two months. Upon com-
pletion of the computation, the transactions are transmitted to the managing ICP. These transactions must
reach the managing ICP by 15 February each year.

2.2. System Operation. The system receives stocklist change data from the D043 system (monthly) to
update NSN records. The monthly operation also receives D062 demands and applications. D040 does
not supply TA data - only WRM prepositioned quantity and RSP (which includes HMPSK) for each
application. The M024B system is used for transmission of requirements to the Army, Navy, Marine
Corps, and GSA. DLA receives a tape at each applicable site. The system operates quarterly to process
Air Force demands received on items managed by the DLA, Army, Navy, Marines, and the GSA. These
demands are provided each quarter by the DAAS (on magnetic tape). Prepositioned WRM requirements
are received from the D040 system each quarter. The records contain NSN, prepositioned quantity, appli-
cation data, MDS, TA, and Communication Electronics (CE). C001 produces a file semiannually (end of
March/September) of In-Use/Authorized quantities for WRM and non-WRM budget code 9 equipment
items. Requirements are computed annually (in January). Individual requirements for each NSN are trans-
mitted by the M024 system to the managing ICPs. The transactions must be received by 15 February
annually. A microfiche copy of the completed transactions is sent to HQ AFMC/LGI.

2.3. System Configuration. D072 is processed on the Amdahl computer.

2.4. System Organization. The system contains five master files and eight work unit codes. The system
is organized into five files as listed below:
    2.4.1. The active item master file contains NSNs with associated stock control data, prepositioned
    WRM requirements, eight quarters of demand, and three years of DM_transactions. The item applica-
    tion master file contains NSNs linked to all types of application data such as aircraft MDS, CE, and
    TAs. The exception master file contains NSNs with associated data from all interfacing systems
    (except D043) that don't match the existing active or inactive master file. The inactive item master file
    contains NSNs received as a result of stocklist changes from the D043 system that don't match any
    other system inputs (i.e., demands, application, prepositioned quantities, etc.). The cross-reference
    master file contains outdated NSNs linked to current NSNs.
    2.4.2. The work units are Major Production (MA, AP, OC, JJ, CO, AN), Major Utility, (IT), and
    Minor Production (RS, QT, TC). The last are used for polished outputs used in major production work
    units. Work units consist of seven types of transactions for file maintenance which include loading of
    information from all of the interfacing systems. The computation work unit includes processing all of
AFMCMAN10-101 24 APRIL 1996                                                                               7


   the information received from the interfacing systems in order to arrive at the output of transactions to
   the wholesale managers. The actual computation is accomplished by dividing the 8 quarters of
   demand (by 24) to arrive at an AMD. The AMD is multiplied by six wartime program factors which
   results in six months of gross OWRMRs. The interrogation work unit processes inquiries by NSN
   which include stock control information, item requirements, demand history, allocation information,
   and miscellaneous data. It processes inquiries by application and by AAC. This work unit also pro-
   cesses ICP inquiries containing NSNs and applications.

2.5. Performance. The system produces OWRMRs computations once a year (January) to provide bud-
geting information to DLA, GSA, and the other services to support the needs of the Air Force. The system
also produces four types of interrogations for management information and error correction.

2.6. Data Base. The system has five master files. The most important files are the active item master and
the item application master:
   2.6.1. The item application master file relates NSNs to application and in turn to the wartime factor in
   the computation work unit. The application master receives its information from the D043 system for
   NSN, interchangeability and substitution (I&S) master NSN, and D040/D062 application data.
   2.6.2. The active item master file contains most of the systems information. The interfacing systems
   and what information they provide are as follows:
       2.6.2.1. The NSN and stock control data are provided by the D043 system.
       2.6.2.2. The master NSN is provided by the D043 system.
       2.6.2.3. RSP requirements are received from the D040 system.
       2.6.2.4. TA information is received from the C001 system.
       2.6.2.5. Demand history information is received from DAAS.
       2.6.2.6. The DMA transactions are computed within the D072 system and then posted to the sys-
       tem.
       2.6.2.7. The WCDO data comes from AFC2S.
       2.6.2.8. The inactive item master file contains NSNs that don't match on application, demands, or
       prepositioned WRM quantities.
       2.6.2.9. The exception master file contains NSNs that are not matched by any other master file in
       D072.
       2.6.2.10. The cross-reference master file contains obsolete NSNs that are related to current NSNs.
       This information is built from monthly stocklist changes received from the D043 system.

2.7. General Description of Inputs, Processing, Outputs. The system OPR, located in HQ AFMC/
LGI, is responsible for manual file maintenance and interrogation transactions.
   2.7.1. Inputs. Manual input transactions are used to change elements of data in the active item master
   file, for input of the flying hour program data and for interrogating the active item master file and the
   item application master file.
8                                                                  AFMCMAN10-101 24 APRIL 1996


       2.7.1.1. File maintenance to the active item master file (Attachment 1) consists of changing the
       quantities in the transactions. The first and second quarter WRMR quantities and the sustained
       monthly demand rate can be changed. This transaction is used to correct known errors that are
       detected during the computation cycle or by the item manager (IM) at the controlling ICP. It cor-
       rects only the active item master file. To input these transactions, the system OPR must send them
       to DISA/WED22 (Keyplus) to be keyed in within 24 hours of the processing date.
       2.7.1.2. The flying hour program data (Attachment 2) is identified by record code PGM in col-
       umns 78-80. The program data contains an MDS and its average monthly peacetime flying hours
       and six months of wartime flying hours as well as an average of monthly peacetime hours to arrive
       at a multiplier factor. If the wartime hours are higher than the peacetime hours, i.e., wartime hours
       500, peacetime hours 100, the factor (5) is used in the computation. The peacetime demands (24
       months) contained in the active item master file are used to obtain an AMD. The AMD is multi-
       plied by each of the six monthly multiplier factors to produce six months of gross wartime require-
       ments. This data is prepared annually in January. To prepare the data, the system OPR must obtain
       a copy of the wartime and peacetime flying hour program from HQ AFMC/LGI to input the data.
       2.7.1.3. Four types of interrogations (Attachment 4-Attachment 7 ) are processed in this system;
       stock number, source of supply (SOS), application, and acquisition advice code (AAC). All of the
       interrogations are processed against the active item master file and the application master file. The
       stock number reply contains stock control information, requirements data, ICP allocation,
       demands, miscellaneous information, and applications. It is produced as a listing. The SOS reply
       contains all items that have requirements (by SOS in NSN sequence). This product contains stock
       control data, average demands, and application information. It is produced on microfiche. The
       application reply is in NSN sequence. It contains application, NSN, stock control information, and
       average demands. The AAC reply contains the AAC, NSN, stock control data, average demands
       and application data. This reply is produced on microfiche in NSN sequence within AAC. These
       products are used in error correction, for information purposes or to provide the information
       needed for higher headquarters, other agencies, or for congressional inquiries. To obtain this prod-
       uct, the system OPR must prepare the proper interrogation format and data input identification and
       request special processing from DISA/WED22 (Keyplus).
       2.7.1.4. Manual change records (Attachment 8) are used to change the first quarter, second quar-
       ter, and sustained monthly demand periods for the current DMA, first previous DMA, or second
       previous DMA. One transaction must be prepared for each DMA record to be changed. To process
       these transactions, the system OPR must prepare the proper format (on an 80-column worksheet)
       and ask for special processing from DISA/WED22 (Keyplus) before processing the interroga-
       tions.
    2.7.2. Processing. The system has been set up to run as required monthly, quarterly, semiannually, and
    annually in order to accept information from interfacing systems and to produce the specified prod-
    ucts. When unscheduled products such as interrogations are required, schedule the operation of the
    system by product control number (PCN) and notify DISA/WED22 (Keyplus) before the processing
    date.
    2.7.3. Outputs:
       2.7.3.1. The results of the annual computation are output in DMA and DME format (attachment
       l). To compute a requirement on a given NSN, a flying hour program transaction that matches that

     NSNs application must be loaded into the system (Attachment 2). These transactions (file label
     PCIC201CPU) are transmitted to the SOS by the M024 system.
     2.7.3.2. Stock Number Replies, PCN: Q-D072-003-IT-2IT (Figure 3.9.). These replies have
     detailed information at the NSN level, and are produced as listings.
     2.7.3.3. Source of Supply Replies, PCN: Q-D072-003-IT-MIT, part 1 (Figure 3.10.). The replies
     are in NSN sequence within SOS; for example, S9C, NSN 1, NSN 2 and NSN 3; S9E, NSN 2,
     NSN 3. These replies are produced on microfiche.
     2.7.3.4. Application Replies, PCN: Q-D072-003-IT-MIT, part 2 (Figure 3.11.). Replies are listed
     in NSN sequence within application (for example, B052, NSN 1, NSN 2, and NSN 3, which are
     produced on microfiche).
     2.7.3.5. Acquisition Advice Replies, PCN: Q-D072-001-IT-VIT, part 3 (Figure 3.12.). Replies
     are in NSN sequence within AAC (for example, AAC-Y, NSN 2, NSN 4, and NSN 5 which are
     produced on microfiche).
     2.7.3.6. These output products will be used by the mission OPR (LGI).

                  STAFF FUNCTIONS RELATED TO TECHNICAL OPERATIONS

3.1. Initiation Procedures. The system is run on a scheduled basis to receive inputs from interfacing
systems monthly, quarterly, semiannually, and annually. Only the annual process requires input from the
system OPR to produce the required transactions. (See paragraphs 2.7.1.2. and 2.7.1.3..) The four interro-
gation processes (stock number, SOS, application, and acquisition advice) require manual input transac-
tions and notice to the DISA/WED22 (Keyplus) work group supervisor. Figure 3.3. through Figure 3.5.
illustrate the information needed to perform interrogations.

3.2. Staff Input Transactions:
     3.2.1. Deliver the flying hour program data for each application (Figure 3.1.) to DISA/WED22 (Key-
     plus) within 24 hours of the annual computation process (January). Interrogation transactions are
     caused by known errors which need corrections or that are requested from higher headquarters and
     other agencies.
     3.2.2. Notify DISA/WED22 (Keyplus) to request for special processing (interrogations). Interroga-
     tions are processed as the need arises.
     3.2.3. The system OPR in the General Support Division of the Air Force Stock Fund originates the
     input transaction and interrogations.

3.3. Input Formats:
     3.3.1. The Flying Hour/Operating Program Record (Figure 3.1.) has the following types of applica-
     tion information: aircraft, missiles, CE equipment, engines, guns, support equipment, and WRM TAs.
     The system currently uses flying hour by mission design (MD) in the actual computation. The appli-
     cation for aircraft consists of seven positions - the first position is an alpha code or blank for modified
     mission. The second and third positions are alpha codes to identify the mission. Positions four through
     six are numerical denoting the design. The seventh position is an alpha or blank denoting the series.
     The first line in Figure 3.1. illustrates the current configuration of the system which accepts only MD
     (e.g., BO52) for computational purposes.
     3.3.2. The SOS interrogation record (Figure 3.2.) contains a record code (constant 1) and SOS which
     is a three-position MILSTRIP routing identifier code.
     3.3.3. The application interrogation record (Figure 3.3.) contains a record code (constant 2) and an
     application number. Aircraft and missiles application numbers begin in column 2 and end in column
     8. Column 5 through column 7 are for design (zero filled numerics). Column 8 contains series (alpha).
     Other applications (such as NSN) begin in column 2 extending to column 13.
     3.3.4. The stock number interrogation record (Figure 3.4.) contains a record code (constant 3) and a
     national item identification number (NIIN).
     3.3.5. The acquisition advice interrogation record (Figure 3.5.) contains a record code (constant 4).
     3.3.6. The manual change record (Figure 3.6.) contains a record code, DMA quantities, month/year,
     and unit of issue. It returns a microfiche report of nearly every entry in the active master (approxi-
     mately one million items).
AFMCMAN10-101 24 APRIL 1996                                                                              11


3.4. Composition Rules:
   3.4.1. The four types of interrogations can't exceed 200 lines.
   3.4.2. Each input line can have a maximum of 80 characters.
   3.4.3. All items must be right justified.

3.5. Input Vocabulary. Prepare all input transaction on an 80-column worksheet (AF Form 1530, Punch
Card Transcript). Send it to the DISA/WED22 (Keyplus) work group supervisor. The transactions must
have an AFMC Form 381, Batch Control - Product Routing - Disposition (Figure 3.7.), attached. All
of the interrogations are input as work unit IT, PCN Q-D072-003-lT-2IT. The flying hour operating pro-
gram record is input 15 January each year using PCN Q-D072.C02-ZCl.

3.6. Output Requirements:
   3.6.1. Purpose. The DM_ Transaction Report PCN Q-D072.002-CO-VC1 contains a record of the
   OWRMRs transactions that are transmitted to the managing ICP of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps,
   DLA, and GSA. The interrogation transactions are processed when there are questions requiring
   detailed information concerning NSN, application, and SOS. Requests can originate from the other
   services, agencies, or higher headquarters.
   3.6.2. Time. The DM_Transactions Report is produced each year in January. The interrogation
   reports are produced randomly, when required.
   3.6.3. Medium. All of the output products are produced on microfiche except for the stock number
   interrogation which is a printed listing.

   output each time interrogations are processed. For each interrogation it produces an item count or a
   zero if no match occurs.

3.9. Utilization of System Outputs:
   3.9.1. Data for Review Notices. Three distinct data for review notices are automatically output during
   DO72 runs. These notices provide statistical information and help find errors within various process-
   ing cycles.
   3.9.2. Interrogation Outputs. The interrogation output products provide specific information to the
   system OPR. They are used for budget information, general stock control information, and item appli-
   cation information, when required locally, for higher headquarters, or by other agencies.
   3.9.3. Production Products. The DM_Transactions are transmitted each year in January to the manag-
   ing ICPs. These transactions provide Air Force requirements to non-Air Force managing activities.
   3.9.4. Recovery and Error Correction Procedures. The computation data for review (Figure 3.13.)
   and the file maintenance data for review (figure 3.14) notices are used for statistical purposes and
   detecting errors during processing cycles. The computation data review notices give counts on the
   various types of items loaded into the system such as, the number of applications with matching flying
   hour programs (by MDS) and a count of items with demand, flying hour programs, and prepositioned
   WRM. The file maintenance data for review provides counts on the items input from interfacing sys-
   tems and by manual file maintenance. These counts include WRM application (WAP from D040),
   demands from D062 demands from DAAS (DAS), WCDO, and miscellaneous application (MAP).
   Corrections will be made after the computation by file maintaining requirement quantities (see
   Attachment 8 and Figure 3.6.) or by rerunning the system.
