      2.4.11. Document unit training and appoint unit container monitors on use and
      preparation of AF Form 451.
      2.4.12. Monitor and establish effective metrics to account for and control reusable
      containers and materials.
   2.5. Procedures. 35 LRS/LGRDDC will ensure that items received are not separated from
   their respective containers. If an item is received without its proper container, a Supply
   Discrepancy Report (SDR) will be accomplished and maintained with the property.
      2.5.1. 35 LRS Storage and Issue Element (35 LRS/LGRMSS) will ensure the original
      container remains with the issued item. When property requiring a Special Packaging
      Instruction (SPI) is issued without the SPI container, 35 LRS/LGRMSS will annotate the
      accompanying DD Form 1348-1A, to indicate whether or not the property was issued in a
      reusable container. The using agency will retain the annotated DD Form 1348-1A, and
      SDR if applicable, to validate future turn-in shipments of reparable assets without the
      proper container.
      2.5.2. 35 LRS Flight Service Center (35 LRS/LGRMMF) will not accept an item for turn
      in that needs a reusable container unless the item is accompanied by an AF Form 451 or
      proof that the item was issued to the unit without the correct container (i.e. - a copy of the
      DD Form 1348-1A, or Report of Discrepancy/SDR if applicable, signed and stamped
      when the item was originally issued. If an item was issued without a container, base
      Flight Service Center will initiate the AF Form 451.
      2.5.3. When an item is received in a container that is contractor packed, every effort
      should be made to return the item, or its authorized substitute, in the original container.
      Do not obliterate any markings on that container or any other container (i.e., ID,
      serviceable tag, packaging labels, etc.). Exception: Container markings on munitions
      shipping containers must be IAW T.O. 11A-1-60.
      2.5.4. Other units on the installation must ensure that all items requiring shipment are in
      the required container. Items received from 35 LRS Base Supply will stay in their
      containers until such time as required for bench stock or inspection.
      2.5.5. All units should ensure that when an asset is removed from the container and put
      in use that the asset being replaced is immediately put in the same container for turn-in.
      If the container is not immediately reused, when the item is removed, it will be kept in
      the appropriate storage area. Ensure all internal blocking, bracing and cushioning
      materials are placed in the container.
3. Arms, Ammunition and Explosive (AA&E)
   3.1. Scope. This chapter applies to all personnel whose duties involve receiving, processing,
   packaging, handling and shipping of AA&E, including non-nuclear munitions.

    arrivals after hours, contact the Command Post for 35 LRS/LGRDDC standby personnel. An
    AF Form 4388, Inbound Transportation Protective Service Material Checklist, will be
    initiated per AFI 24-203, paragraph 5.1.8. 35 LRS/LGRDDC will, upon receipt of a Report
    of Shipment (REPSHIP), advise the 35 MXS Munitions Flight (DSN 226-3015) of the
    shipment quantity, type, Transportation Control Number (TCN) and estimated time and/or
    date of arrival.
    3.7. Inbound Shipments via Surface. All munitions movements, except for US Navy,
    originating from off base will be coordinated by the 35 MXS Munitions Flight with the 35
    SFS Control Center (35 SFS/SFCC) a minimum of 3 hours prior to its estimated time of
    arrival to Misawa Air Base. All incoming munitions laden trucks, regardless of explosive
    class, are to enter through the Misawa Apple Gate. Drivers will advise the gate guard to
    notify 35 LRS/LGRDDC and/or 35 MXS Munitions Flight for an escort/inspector.
       3.7.1. The gate guard will in-turn notify the SFCC and 35 LRS/LGRDDC of the truck’s
       arrival and instruct the driver to standby at the vehicle staging area for arrival of the
       escort(s).
       3.7.2. Upon arrival of the escort(s), the driver will be directed for processing through the

     4.2.6. 35 LRS/LGRDDC will ensure each asset is enclosed in two opaque sealed
     containers or similar wrapping. If the classified material is an internal component of an
     item of equipment, the outside shell or body of the item may be considered to be a
     sufficient enclosure if it does not reveal classified information. Specialized shipping
     containers including closed cargo transporters may also be considered as the outer
     wrapping or cover.
     4.2.7. 35 LRS/LGRDDC will ensure all previous markings on exterior shipping
     container are obliterated. No new markings on the exterior container will contain any
     information indicating the piece is of a classified nature, e.g., security classification
     marking or Transportation Protective Service (TPS) required. However, when a
     shipment goes by military airlift, the DD Form 1387-2 must show the TPS required in
     Block 6. See DTR 4500.9R, Part II, Chapter 205, paragraph I.2, for DD Form1387-2
     preparation and distribution instructions. Note: Maintenance TOs may require a
     nomenclature marking on the exterior of the shipping container.

   7.1. Scope. NWRM is a separately defined materiel classification. The successful
   application of these procedures requires the full cooperation of all 35 FW personnel
   associated with the handling and shipment of NWRM assets. NWRM is not typically
   shipped to/from or transitioned through Misawa Air Base, Japan.
   7.2. Responsibilities. All personnel assigned to Misawa that may be required to process,
   package, handle and/or transport NRWM will abide by guidance set forth in AFI 21-203,
   Nuclear Accountability Procedures, as well as any other applicable AFIs that may govern
   NWRM.
      7.2.1. 35 FW Group Commanders/Directors ensure all individuals and organizations
      which physically control, possess, store and maintain nuclear weapons account for these
      resources while in their custody in accordance with T.O. 11N-100-3150, Joint Reporting
      Structure Nuclear Weapons Reports.
      7.2.2. 35 LRS Commander, 35 MXS Commander and other applicable unit commanders
      will appoint, in writing, personnel who are authorized to process, ship and receive
      NWRM materiel. Only personnel who are trained and have the appropriate security
      clearance will be authorized to handle this type of asset. Note: JPAS will be used to
      verify Security Clearance Eligibility, Investigation Status and Access Levels; therefore,
      units must provide the          35 LRS/LGRDDC an update immediately if an individual's
      clearance eligibility and/or access level is downgraded or changed.
16                                                      MISAWAABI24-203 14 MAY 2014


     7.2.3. It is the responsibility of all personnel involved with handling, movement,
     shipment and storage of NWRM to comply with the procedures contained in this
     instruction, public law, policy, agreements and applicable international, federal and
     military directives incorporated or referenced in this publication.
  7.3. General NWRM Discrepancy Reporting. Any individual who suspects they have
  discovered an NWRM discrepancy shall immediately notify the applicable Accountable
  Officer (AO) appointed. All potential NWRM discrepancies require immediate notification.
  7.4. Commanders Responsibilities. The NWRM AO/Munitions Accountable Systems
  Officer (MASO)/local LRS Commander/Director will notify the Air Force Global Logistics
  Support Center (AFGLSC) and the MAJCOM NWRM POC within 12 hours of a potential
  NWRM discrepancy and complete the NWRM Discrepancy Notification template located on
  the       NWRM           SharePoint     site   at      the     following      address:
  https://cs.eis.af.mil/afnuclearmunitions/NWRM/Incident/default.aspx.   The AFGLSC
  NWRM Transaction Control Cell (NTCC) can be contacted at DSN 312-576-4633
  (Commercial 618-256-4633) 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, or at
  635scow.ntcc@scott.af.mil. (Mandatory information fields are identified with a red
  asterisk on the NWRM Discrepancy Notification template.)
  7.5. Shipment Information. The shipment originator will be responsible for annotating
  correct NWRM data on the DD Form 1348-1A. All NWRM will be handled and shipped
  according to their respective CIIC.
     7.5.1. The shipment originator will provide a printed serial number list along with the
     shipping document(s). A separate serial numbers listing is not required when all serial
     numbers are printed on the DD Form 1348-1A.
     7.5.2. The DD Form 1348-1A MUST be stamped with the following statement in red
     ink: “Classified NWRM Item.”
     7.5.3. Nuclear weapons and NWRM will be shipped and documented in accordance with
     AFI 21-203 and AFI 24-203.
     7.5.4. In the event the appropriate supply system is not available, request a one-time
     authorization in writing from the NWRM AO to process a manual DD Form 1348-1A.
     The manual 1348-1A will include all applicable data as the automated version, to include
     SPI data. Once the applicable system is available, the shipment transaction data will be
     loaded immediately.
  7.6. DD Form 1149 Requirements. The DD Form 1149 is not authorized for shipping
  NWRM except when necessary to meet requirements indicated below.
     7.6.1. When a DD Form 1149 and Truck Manifest is directed to use secure ground
     transportation, the shipment originator is responsible for accomplishing the DD Form
     1149 and providing the appropriate data in Block 4 and the quantity (Block 4(d)) of the
     total number of items under one TCN/requisition number. The shipment originator will
     stamp the DD Form 1149 with the statement “Classified NWRM Item” in red ink.
     7.6.2. The shipment originator will present the DD Form 1149 to 35 LRS/LGRDDC who
     will enter the data into CMOS to produce a truck manifest and verify the total quantities
     on the DD Form 1149 and piece totals on the truck manifest match. This is accomplished
MISAWAABI24-203 14 MAY 2014                                                        17


     for each TCN/requisition number. 35 LRS/LGRDDC will accomplish other shipping
     documentation (e.g., REPSHIP, DD Form 1907).
  7.7. Shipment Preparation. The shipment originator ensures NWRM is properly packaged
  and marked in accordance with proper SPIs. On-base movements of NWRM for organic
  consolidation which do not transfer accountability follow instructions issued by the
  installation NWRM AO.
