days to 4 duty days; changed time for the Wing Commander (6 AMW/CC) out-brief from 11
duty days to 15 duty days after exercise termination (ENDEX); added Remedial Action Program
(RAP) statement; added Air Mobility Command/Inspector General (AMC/IG) Pre-Approved
Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI) Simulations and Limitations as guidance for local
exercise simulations. Added Abbreviations and Acronyms to Attachment 1; modified
Attachment 2; modified Attachment 3; modified Attachment 4.
1. General. Air Force and Headquarters, Air Mobility Command (HQ AMC), guidance tasks
the 6 AMW to conduct periodic exercises to determine unit readiness. Exercise frequency is
governed by directive and unit performance.
2. Program Objectives. The goal of this program is to improve organizational effectiveness by
giving commanders an independent assessment of their organization’s capability to meet mission
tasking. The program will evaluate the ability of the 6 AMW to respond to accidents, disasters,
increased states of readiness, and deployments in support of worldwide contingency operations.
3. Applicability. This instruction applies to all 6 AMW units. Mission-partner units may be
asked to support exercises within their capabilities and areas of responsibility. There is also a
continuing requirement for units to conduct exercises that are not specifically covered by this
instruction. These involve unit-unique training scenarios. Exercise planning must ensure
thorough scenario development and coordination with tasked units. All exercises that impact the
daily operations of the 6 AMW and mission-partner units must be coordinated through 6
AMW/XPI.
4. Responsibilities.
     4.1. 6 AMW/CC is the approval authority for all wing exercises conducted on MacDill AFB
     and will ensure the wing can successfully respond to a variety of operational challenges.
     4.2. 6 AMW/XPI will:
        4.2.1. Direct the wing Exercise Evaluation Team (EET).
        4.2.2. Schedule, plan, and conduct wing exercises.
        4.2.3. Develop, coordinate, and maintain the wing annual exercise calendar.
        4.2.4. Develop objectives and scenarios for all exercises based on inputs from the
        EMWG and EET members.
        4.2.5. Coordinate all exercises with Group Commanders, 6 AMW Director of Staff and
        the Installation Deployment Officer (IDO) as required.
        4.2.6. Maintain training records and appointment letters of assigned EET members.
     4.3. Group Commanders, Director of Staff and Squadron Commanders will designate an
     appropriate number of highly qualified individuals (primary and alternates) as EET members
     to evaluate all exercises. Members will serve as functional area evaluators and must be
     available upon request by the EET chief for the duration of the exercise. All EET members
     will be considered ―Trusted Agents.‖
     4.4. 6 AMW EET members will:
        4.4.1. Keep close-hold information in EET channels only except for information
        approved for release by 6 AMW/XPI.
MACDILLAFBI10-204 30 APRIL 2012                                                                   3


      4.4.2. Accomplish required training after appointment to EET.
      4.4.3. During all exercises, wear EET badge and safety reflective belt at all times.
      4.4.4. Solicit commander inputs for exercise objectives and scenarios.                  Brief
      commanders on major problems noted during exercises as soon as possible after exercise
      termination (intent is to validate findings prior to the formal debrief). Stop and correct all
      activities when a safety violation occurs.
      4.4.5. Conduct evaluations according to scenario guidelines and evaluation checklists.
      4.4.6. Report to their designated inspection stations as directed by the EET Chief.
      4.4.7. Be available throughout the exercise and critique period, not only to evaluate, but
      to answer questions, provide additional information, and validate findings. EET
      members will be released to their work centers by the EET Chief following the EET
      debrief.
      4.4.8. Provide exercise inputs to 6 AMW/XPI within 1 duty day after the exercise
      ―Hotwash‖ for the formal report. All after action inputs should be submitted
      electronically using the format at Attachment 2, Exercise Observation. Each input must
      include EET member’s badge number and source of discrepancy.
5. Exercise Evaluation Team Selection.
   5.1. Only highly qualified individuals with a minimum of 1-year retainability will be
   assigned to the EET. Commanders will select team members from within their respective
   organizations. Assignment to the EET will be an additional duty. Commanders will ensure
   that team members are available upon request of the EET Chief. Once an exercise begins, all
   team members will be under the control of the EET Chief until released back to their duty
   stations.
   5.2. Each group will provide 6 AMW/XPI with an appointment letter for personnel from
   their organization. Letters of appointment will be in the format specified in Attachment 3 of
   this instruction. Appointment letters will be updated as changes occur and submitted to 6
   AMW/XPI. All appointments are subject to approval by 6 AMW/CV. Replacement
   personnel will be assigned 60 days prior to permanent change of station/permanent change of
   assignment of current team members. 6 AMW/XPI will brief replacements. Formal training
   will be conducted in accordance with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-2501, Air Force
   Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations.
   5.3. EET members must complete required EM training as soon as possible after their
   appointment to the team (not later than 60 days). AMC Supplement to AFI 10-2501 lists
   EET requirements.
6. Procedures.
   6.1. 6 AMW/XPI will have overall responsibility for exercise scenario development;
   however, 6 AMW/XPI will request input from unit EET members to exercise unit-specific
   functional areas. Operational Readiness Exercise (ORE) scenarios are particularly complex
   and require input from all base support agencies. Scenario development may take up to
   several weeks.
 4                                                      MACDILLAFBI10-204 30 APRIL 2012


     6.2. 6 AMW/XPI will identify and brief all required EET members prior to exercise
     initiation. Each team member will be issued a badge identifying him or her as a 6 AMW
     exercise evaluator.
     6.3. For maximum realism, exercise information will be disseminated on a need-to-know
     basis and will be released to as few individuals as possible. All flight-line exercise activity
     will be coordinated with Airfield Management Operations and Tower.
     6.4. Evaluators, using appropriate checklists, will closely monitor and evaluate their
     designated areas. They will minimize interference with the personnel or function being
     evaluated; however, evaluators will take immediate action to stop all unsafe actions
     involving personnel or equipment.
     6.5. At the conclusion of the exercise, the EET chief will conduct a ―Hotwash‖ with the EET
     within 24-hours of ENDEX.
     6.6. The team will prepare a written AAR using Attachment 2 format. One of the goals of
     the EET is to make each exercise better than the last. To do this, input must be in the form of
     constructive criticism or laudatory comments. Each observation must have the EET member
     badge number and the source of the observation, i.e., EET #4, Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM)
     90-902, Operational Risk Management (ORM) Guidelines and Tools, page 61. For an ORE,
     also identify the chapter to which the observation pertains, i.e., Initial Response,
     Employment, Mission Support, Ability to Survive and Operate, or Operation Plan (OPLAN)
     8010, and the established rating criteria as determined by 6 AMW/XPI. This report will be in
     sufficient detail to identify and report those problems requiring command and staff corrective
     action.
        6.7.1. EET members will submit inputs to 6 AMW/XPI not later than 1 duty day after the
        exercise. 6 AMW/XPI will release a draft AAR to EET 2 duty days after the exercise for
        validation. The EET validations must be completed and returned to 6 AMW/XPI not
        later than 3 duty days after the exercise. 6 AMW/XPI will release an EET validated
        AAR to the Squadron and Group Commanders for Corrective Action/Reply 4 duty days
        after the exercise. Squadron and group commanders must return the AAR with
        Corrective Action/Reply not later than 10 duty days after the exercise. Report
        publication and outbrief to 6 AMW/CC will be not later than 15 workdays following
        ENDEX.
     6.8. All findings will be assigned an OPR by the evaluation team. The OPR of the listed
     deficiency will initiate corrective action and submit an electronic written reply through the
     respective group commander to 6 AMW/XPI. The reply must be in electronic spreadsheet
     format to include the fix, squadron/office symbol, point of contact, phone, estimated
     completion date, and open or closed (see Attachment 4).
     6.9. 6 AMW/XPI will use the RAP to track all exercise observations until closed.
7. Exemptions/Simulations for Wing Exercises or HQ AMC Evaluations.
     7.1. Personnel who have been given medical profiles (AF Form 422, Notification of Air
     Force Member’s Qualification Status) whose participation would be detrimental to the
     individual as well as those directly involved in the activities listed below are excused from
MACDILLAFBI10-204 30 APRIL 2012                                                          5


  participation in exercises.   Tasked squadrons will identify the shortfall and provide
  replacements.
     7.1.1. Airman Leadership School.
     7.1.2. Weighted Airman Promotion System testing.
  7.2. 6 AMW/CV must approve all simulation requests before the unit may consider them
  valid. Simulations must be kept to an absolute minimum and must be submitted via 6
  AMW/XPI through 6 AMW/XP to CV.
     7.2.1. 6 AMW/XPI will use the AMC/IG Pre-Approved ORI Simulations and
     Limitations, 1 March 2011, as a guide for local exercise simulations. Additionally,
     AMC/IG NORI SPINS and AMC/IG ORI SPINS will also be used as a guide for local
     exercises.
     7.2.2. ORE simulation requests will be submitted by using AMC Form 188,
     Inspection/Exercise Communication. All requests for simulations must answer the
     following questions: WHAT? (Describe the simulation task or equipment.) HOW?
     (Describe how you will simulate the task.) WHY? (Provide a brief explanation of why
     the simulation is required and the impact if the EET disapproves the simulation.). AMC
     Ground Rules and MacDill Ground Rules for Exercises have pre-approved simulations.
