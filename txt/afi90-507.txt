                                               Chapter 1

                                   PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Overview. The Drug Demand Reduction Program (DDRP) directly impacts mission
readiness. The success of this long-standing program can be traced directly to strong command
support at all levels.
   1.1.1. Illicit Drug Use. The Air Force does not tolerate the illegal or improper use of drugs
   by Air Force personnel. Such use:
   1.1.2. Is a serious breach of discipline.
   1.1.3. Is not compatible with service in the Air Force.
   1.1.4. Automatically places the member's continued service in jeopardy.
   1.1.5. Can lead to criminal prosecution resulting in a punitive discharge or administrative
   actions, including separation or discharge under other than honorable conditions.
   1.1.6. Studies have shown that products made with hemp seed and hemp seed oil may
   contain varying levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), an active ingredient of marijuana,
   which is detectable under the Air Force Drug Testing Program. In order to ensure military
   readiness, the ingestion of products containing or products derived from hemp seed or hemp
   seed oil is prohibited. Failure to comply with the mandatory provisions of this
   paragraph by military personnel is a violation of Article 92, UCMJ. Violations may
   result in administrative disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable
   criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws.
   1.1.7. In order to ensure military readiness; safeguard the health and wellness of the force,
   and maintain good order and discipline in the service, the knowing use of any intoxicating
   substance, other than the lawful use of alcohol or tobacco products, that is inhaled, injected,
   consumed, or introduced into the body in any manner to alter mood or function is prohibited.
   These substances include, but are not limited to, controlled substance analogues (e.g.,
   designer drugs such as "spice" that are not otherwise controlled substances); inhalants,
   propellants, solvents, household chemicals, and other substances used for "huffing";
   prescription or over-the-counter medications when used in a manner contrary to their
   intended medical purpose or in excess of the prescribed dosage; and naturally occurring
   intoxicating substances (e.g., Salvia divinorum). The possession of any intoxicating
   substance described in this paragraph, if done with the intent to use in a manner that would
   alter mood or function, is also prohibited. Failure to comply with the prohibitions contained
   in this paragraph is a violation of Article 92, UCMJ. Violations may result in administrative
   disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions for
   violations of related laws.
1.2. Goals and Objectives of the Drug Demand Reduction Program.
   1.2.1. Enhance mission readiness and foster a drug-free environment through a
   comprehensive program of education, prevention, deterrence, and community outreach in
   support of the President’s National Drug Control Strategy.
6                                                            AFI90-507 22 SEPTEMBER 2014


    1.2.2. Community outreach is defined as on and off base prevention, drug
    education/awareness and deterrence activities targeted to Department of Defense (DoD)
    family members, retirees, civilians, and contractors.
    1.2.3. Maintain the health and wellness of a fit and ready fighting force as well as a drug-
    free Air Force community.
    1.2.4. Deter military members, including those members on initial entry on RegAF after
    enlistment or appointment from using illegal drugs and abusing controlled substances.
    1.2.5. Assist commanders in assessing the security, military fitness, readiness, and good
    order and discipline of their commands.
    1.2.6. Detect and identify those individuals who use and abuse illegal drugs and other
    prohibited/controlled substances.
    1.2.7. Provide a basis for action against a service member who tests positive for illicit drug
    use.
    1.2.8. Ensure that urine specimens collected as part of the drug abuse testing program are
    supported by a legally defensible chain of custody procedure at the collection site, during
    transport, and at the drug testing laboratory.
    1.2.9. Ensure that all AF military specimens are tested by a DoD certified drug testing
    laboratory. Re-tests may be sent to a DoD-certified laboratory, the Armed Forces Medical
    Examiner System (AFMES) or a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
    Administration (SAMHSA)-certified laboratory.
    1.2.10. Ensure Air Force personnel recognize that the wrongful use of anabolic steroids,
    controlled substances, and other substances such as inhalants, prescription drugs, and over-
    the-counter medications by Air Force military members is an offense under the UCMJ. ANG
    members in Title 32 status are accountable to the State Code of Military Justice.
    1.2.11. Ensure that AF members serving in Joint-Service commands, operations, and schools
    are tested according to the commanding service requirements. Host commanders may, at
    their discretion, test any and all Temporary Duty (TDY) personnel assigned to their units
    IAW the procedures outlined in this Instruction. Urine Specimen collection of other Service
    personnel may be performed under the AF Drug Testing Program, provided the commanding
    Service establishes either a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or a Memorandum of
    Agreement (MOA) to perform such testing. Absent the establishment of an MOU or MOA,
    testing of other Service personnel will be the responsibility of the respective Service.
       1.2.11.1. The supporting Component at joint bases will manage the drug testing program
       for all military personnel assigned to the joint base and any affiliated geographically
       separate units and detachments, in accordance with each supported Component’s
       respective policies and procedures for selection, collection, packaging, shipping, and
       testing (including utilizing supported component personnel as needed to comply with
       those policies and procedures).
    1.2.12. Foreign/International students will be tested using the same standard as U.S. military
    members only when authorized by international agreement or other legal authority.
AFI90-507 22 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    7


1.3. Levels and Frequency of Testing.
   1.3.1. AF DDRPs will ensure compliance with DoD standards for AF end strength testing
   annually. (T-0) For example, at 100% testing rate, an installation with an end-strength of
   5,000 Regular Air Force (RegAF) personnel must collect and ship a total of 5,000 specimens
   per year. This is accomplished through random selection of RegAF personnel using the Air
   Force Drug Testing Program (AFDTP) software or through a combination of random
   selection and dorm, unit sweeps/gate sweeps. (T-0).
       1.3.1.1. If a combination of random selection and unit sweeps/gate checks are used,
       random selection using the Air Force Drug Testing Program (AFDTP) software must be
       at a level commensurate with guidelines established or agreed upon by DoD, Drug
       Enforcement Policy and Support and Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF). (T-1) All
       members must be tested at a rate of one test per member per year IAW DoDI 1010.1. (T-
       0) In order to ensure sufficient numbers are selected, the AFDTP software selection rate
       should be set at a selection rate no less than 9% per month for all Service Members. (T-1)
       The AFDTP Software Testing Target Rate can be adjusted (up or down) to ensure annual
       collection rates are achieved. ARC will use the Reserve version of the AFDTP software
       for random selections and will follow any additional AFRC provided guidance. (T-1)
   1.3.2. All new accessions (officer and enlisted personnel) will be tested, as defined in
   Section F of this Instruction. (T-0)
1.3.3. Untestable Specimen Rate. Wing CCs should keep the untestable specimen rate as low
as reasonably achievable in order to maximize program value. (T-3) If the rate of untestable
specimens exceeds one percent in a month, installation commanders should take appropriate
action and have a plan in place to decrease untestables. (T-3) Untestable discrepancies at GSUs
will not be counted against the untestable rate at the host installation. (T-3)
1.3.4. Air Reserve Component (ARC) members will be tested utilizing available Reserve
Component resources and constraints on training time. (T-1) Reserve component personnel on
extended active duty (Guard in Federal status or active Reserve personnel) will be tested at the
same rate as the RegAF component. (T-0) Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs) are the
responsibility of the RegAF. (T-2) Activated and mobilized reservists are the responsibility of
the gaining Major Command (MAJCOM). (T-1) ANG only: Wing’s must receive approval prior
to testing ANG members who are in T10 status by e-mailing 201st MSS. (T-2)
   1.3.5. A combination of random and other forms of inspection testing (e.g., unit/gate
   sweeps) will be performed no less than eight days per month (four days at GSUs). (T-1)
   Bases that have a population of 500 RegAF or less are only required to test four days a
   month. (T-1) Computer generated random testing days or commander (computer code: CO)
   selected testing days for Random Selection Testing must occur on at least six days per month
   (three days at GSUs and bases with a population of 500 RegAF or less). (T-1) The computer
   program must be run (button pushed) at least 15 days per month unless fewer days are
   approved by the Wing CC. (This is not applicable to ARC.) (T-2)
       1.3.5.1. The Drug Testing Administrative Manager (DTPAM) at a Geographically
       Separated Unit (GSU) can run local drug testing software to select testing days and
       personnel for testing. (T-3) Alternatively, personnel assigned to GSUs can be included in
       the drug testing software of the host-base DDRP. (T-3) The latter option is preferable at
8                                                              AFI90-507 22 SEPTEMBER 2014


       small GSUs to prevent personnel from being selected more frequently than personnel
       assigned to larger facilities.
           1.3.5.1.1. When the host base software is used to select GSU personnel for testing,
           the Drug Demand Reduction Program Manager (DDRPM) (or DTPAM) will pre-
           designate at the beginning of the month which host-base testing days will include the
           GSU (for example, the first, third, fourth and seventh random testing days will
           include the GSU). (T-3) The selected schedule will not be shared with the GSU; the
           DTPAM at the GSU will be notified only on the day of testing. (T-3)
           1.3.5.1.2. Names of GSU personnel selected by the host base on days that are not
           designated for testing at the GSU will be held by host-base DDRP and not
           communicated to the trusted agent or DTPAM at the GSU until the next GSU testing
           day. (T-3) If the host base software does not select personnel from a specific GSU to
           meet the minimum requirement of four testing days, this should be documented in an
           MFR by the host base and the GSU will not be required to test four days (so long as
           all assigned personnel are in the selection pool and are vulnerable to selected each
           time the software selects names). (T-3)
       1.3.5.2. Daily random testing is strongly encouraged.
    1.3.6. ARC will perform random and other forms of inspection testing at a frequency
    deemed appropriate by the reserve wing commander to meet DoD established rates. (T-3)
    The reserve wing commander is responsible for ensuring randomization and level of testing
    is met. (T-3) Monthly testing is highly encouraged. While the minimum rate of testing
    outlined in this paragraph does not strictly apply to Reserve Component units, every effort to
    achieve an equivalent rate of testing should be made. (T-3)
       1.3.6.1. Air Reserve Component (ARC) members require testing. (T-0) Testing rates
       should ensure DoD compliance with current end-strength population testing rates for
       each unit annually. (T-0)
    1.3.7. Field testing (rapid screening tests) is not authorized. (T-2)
    1.3.8. All requests for waivers to any portion of this AFI, must be submitted to SAF/MR
    through the MAJCOM/Commander ((CC) (or Vice Commander (CV)), AFMOA/SGHW or
    AFMOA/SGB. (T-2)

               2.6.4.6.3.7.2. In the event the DTPAM is randomly selected to provide a drug
               testing specimen, the DTPAM may not handle, prepare paperwork, or package
               and ship his/her own specimen for testing. (T-3) Arrangements must be made
               to ensure that all aspects of packaging and shipment of the box containing the
               DTPAM are performed by an alternate DTPAM (or the DDRPM) who is
               thoroughly knowledgeable and competent to perform this task and who is

        (T-3) The AFRC IDS functions as the action arm of the CAIB and develops a
        comprehensive, coordinated plan for integrating and implementing community
        outreach and prevention programs (e.g., financial, relationship, family maltreatment,
        sexual assault, equal opportunity, suicide prevention, substance abuse, health
        promotion, tobacco cessation, etc.), with the goal of enhancing resilience in military
        communities. The AFRC IDS improves the delivery of human service programs by

        acknowledgement letters are maintained within the unit IAW AFM 33-363
        (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil). (T-3)         Attachment 5 provides a sample
        notification letter to provide a urine sample. Specimen collection is to be conducted
        on the day of selection. (T-3) Once notified, members must report to the testing
        location within two hours. (T-3) Exceptions: a. Commanders will permit personnel
        who must travel to the collection site more than two hours if required by distance
        and/or traffic or weather conditions. (T-3) Any such time extension must be noted in
        the Notification of Selection to Provide a Urine Sample. (T-3) b. Personnel who are
        shift workers or who routinely work alternative duty weeks with weekends during the
        regular duty week must report to the testing location within two hours of notification,
        as soon as possible upon returning to duty, preferably the same day the member
        returns to duty. (T-3) Commanders and/or First Sergeants will coordinate such
        activities with the collector to ensure the member reports for testing, within two hours
        of notification, as soon as possible upon returning to duty, preferably the same day
        the member returns to duty. (T-3) Commanders must not notify members of their
        selection sooner than one hour prior to the available testing period. (T-3)
           2.6.4.8.2.1. Commanders who choose to appoint a designee (such as a deputy
           commander) for issuing and ensuring member notification should consult with the
           servicing SJA. (T-3) Designations must be made in writing. (T-3)
AFI90-507 22 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  25


        2.6.4.8.3. Track individual(s) unavailable for testing because they cannot be located
        at the time, swing shift workers, flying status, etc. (T-3) Members who are on leave,
        TDY, or deployed do NOT need to be kept on the due back list.
           2.6.4.8.3.1. Commanders or designee will coordinate with the collector to ensure
           testing of shift working individuals. (T-3) Commanders must not notify members

           3)
           2.6.4.8.3.2. ARC (to include IMAs). Members who are on, pass, quarters, flying
           status, crew-rest, missile duty, or non-duty status, or who did not attend training
           where their names were randomly selected for drug testing, will report for testing
           during the next training/drug testing period. (T-3) Commanders must not notify
           members of their selection sooner than two hours prior to the scheduled collection
           time. (T-3)
           2.6.4.8.3.3. Commanders, at their discretion, may give Service Members who are
           approved for teleworking the option to select an alternate site for drug testing.
           While most teleworking Service Members will be able to present for drug testing
           at the installation DDRP, some may telework at a location which is a significant
           distance from the installation and an alternate DDRP location may be closer.
           When the Service Member chooses an alternate site, their name will be removed
           from the installation DDRP drug testing software and added to the selection pool
           at the alternate location. (T-3) When selected for testing, the Service Member
           will report to the selected DDRP location regardless of whether they are
           teleworking or working at the traditional duty location. (T-3) Alternatively,
           teleworking Service Members may also be given the option to be included in the
           selection pool at both the installation DDRP and an alternate DDRP. (T-3) When
           this option is selected, the selected Service Member will report to the DDRP
           location that made the selection. (T-3) If the Service Member is teleworking
           when selected by the assigned base DDRP, he or she will not be notified until the
           next work day at the traditional workplace. (T-3) If the Service Member is
           working at the traditional workplace when selected by the alternate DDRP, he or
           she will not be notified until the next telework day. (T-3) The choice to be
           included in the selection pool at two locations can significantly reduce travel time
           for some teleworkers; however, individuals choosing this option must be
           informed of the fact that their chances of being selected will increase two fold. (T-
           3) Those not wanting to subject themselves to increased testing should decline
           this option. (T-3)
               2.6.4.8.3.3.1. Service Members who are given the option to select an alternate
               drug testing site will be given a window of time annually to change their
               selection. (T-3) The time period designated for changes to be made will be
               determined locally by each DDRPM/DTPAM. (T-3) If they discontinue
               approved telework status, however, the installation DDRP will be notified and
               the member’s name will be added to the installation selection pool and
               removed from the alternate site’s pool. (T-3)

        2.6.4.8.3.3.2. If the alternate location is operated by another military Service,
        a memorandum of agreement (MOA) will be signed between the squadron or
        higher level commander and the equivalent commander at the alternate
        location. (T-3) A single MOA can cover multiple Service members. If an
        MOA cannot be completed, the service member will not have the option to
        move to the alternate DDRP. (T-3)
     2.6.4.8.3.4. Take appropriate administrative or UCMJ action against personnel
     who fail to report for testing without a valid reason (leave, pass, TDY, quarters,
     flying status, crew-rest, missile duty, or non-duty status). (T-3) All actions taken
     by commanders must be coordinated with the SJA to ensure the integrity of the
     program. (T-3)
     2.6.4.8.3.5. May order Commander-directed testing. Any Commander-directed
     drug testing must first be coordinated with the SJA. (T-3)

              not be considered a bar to service as a Trusted Agent.
                2.6.4.8.3.7.2.1. Commanders, on a case-by-case basis, make determinations
                as to whether or not conduct is/was dishonest and/or fraudulent, and may
                make exceptions to the rule articulated in above paragraph. (T-3)

     re-accomplished. (T-3) This briefing must consist of a verbal explanation as well as a
     written statement signed and dated by the observer acknowledging their acceptance and
     understanding of their responsibilities and the consequences of their actions for not
     performing their duties IAW established guidelines. (T-3) Attachment 4 of this AFI
     provides a sample observer briefing letter.
     3.1.3.4. Apply the appropriate bottle label to the specimen bottle. (T-2) Collector and
     member will verify the ledger and bottle information are accurate. (T-2) Have the
     individual inspect the bottle in the presence of the DTPAM/Collector and observer,
     making sure that it is not damaged and is clean and free of any debris. (T-2) Instruct the
     individual to carry the specimen bottle so that it is in view of the observer at all times. (T-
     2)
        3.1.3.4.1. Optional use of the individually packaged sterile specimen container cup is
        authorized for collecting urine specimens by female members only. (4 ¾ oz, NSN
        6530-00-837-7472 or NSN 6530-01-048-0855 or equivalent). Immediately after
        collection in the wide mouth collection cup, the urine must be poured into the
        specimen bottle and tightly capped by the person submitting the specimen. (T-2) This
        must be performed under direct observation and supervision of the observer to
        preclude adulteration, contamination, or break in the chain of custody. (T-2)
     3.1.3.5. Direct the individual providing the specimen to remove bulky outer garments

     milliliters. (T-0)
AFI90-507 22 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    33


        3.1.3.6.1. A specimen which appears contaminated or adulterated must be brought to
        the attention of the DTPAM/Collector or DDRPM who will immediately contact the
        SJA for guidance. (T-2) If contamination or adulteration is suspected, take custody of
        the suspected sample and note such custody on the DD Form 2624, Specimen Custody
        Document - Drug Testing. (T-2) Maintain custody of the suspected sample in secure
        storage and release only as directed by SJA. (T-2) Direct the member to remain in
        the area until he/she can provide an acceptable sample in a different specimen bottle
        that complies with all chain of custody requirements. (T-3)
        3.1.3.6.2. If there is inadequate volume, have the member who provided the
        specimen, under direct observation, discard the specimen and return the empty bottle
        to the DTPAM/Collector. (T-3) The DTPAM/Collector will void the label on the
        bottle, and in the ledger or register annotate Quantity Not Sufficient or QNS. (T-3)
        The DTPAM/Collector will deface and discard the label as well as the bottle. (T-3)
        In the case of voided specimens, the information on the label and ledger or register
        must be re-accomplished. (T-3) If using automated labels, annotate the ledger or
        register including QNS and time, and reprint a new label for the member. (T-3) The
        member must remain in the collection facility until a 30 milliliter volume of urine can
        be produced at one time. (T-3)
     3.1.3.7. If the individual provides an adequate volume of specimen, then, in the presence
     of the member, ensure the cap is firmly fixed, then apply tamper evident tape
     (conforming to the shape of the bottle to minimize tearing) extending from approximately
     halfway down and over the gummed label (not covering any identifying information)
     across the bottle cap, and to an approximate midpoint on the other side of the specimen
     bottle, touching the label. (T-0)
     3.1.3.8. Have the member confirm that the SSN and other identifying information on the
     specimen bottle is correct, that the member witnessed the application of the tamper
     evident tape, and that the specimen in the bottle is that of the member. (T-2) Then have
     the member initial (and date, when applicable) the bottle label. (T-2) Have the member
     initial and sign (payroll signature) by his or her printed name in the ledger after verifying
     that the SSN annotated on the bottle label matches the entries in the ledger or register. (T-
     2)
     3.1.3.9. Have the observer initial (and date, when applicable) the bottle label on the line
     marked OB INIT to certify the integrity of the collection process that the urine is that of
     the member. (T-2)
     3.1.3.10. Have the observer print his or her name where designated in the ledger, initial,
     and sign his or her signature next to the member’s entry. (T-3)
     3.1.3.11. If the tape is broken during initial sealing in the presence of the member, or is
     later broken during subsequent repackaging, reseal the bottle with tamper evident tape.
     (T-2) Do not place the tape directly over the original tape. (T-2) The reapplication
     should be slightly offset of the original taping, following the procedures in paragraph
     3.1.3.7. (T-2)
        3.1.3.11.1. When tamper evident tape is reapplied, prepare a memorandum for record
        (MFR) describing the circumstance under which the tape was broken and by whom

         the tape was reapplied, and attach it to the DD Form 2624, Specimen Custody
         Document - Drug Testing. (T-2)
     3.1.3.12. If a second label needs to be placed over an existing label (e.g. label torn,
     writing smeared), prepare a MFR describing the circumstance under which the label
     needed to be replaced and by whom the label was reapplied, and attach it to the DD Form
     2624, Specimen Custody Document - Drug Testing. (T-2) Do not place the label directly
     over the original label – the reapplication should be slightly offset of the original label.
     (T-2) Ensure tamper evident tape covers the second label. (T-2)
         3.1.3.12.1. The use of signature stamps or signatures replacement (e.g.//SIGNED//)

     drug testing lab. (GSUs will send specimens to the DDRPM/DTPAM if required by the
     DDRPM/DTPAM). (T-1)
     3.1.3.14. Any unusual or suspicious activity observed during the collection process must
     be reported to the collector. (T-3) The collector will make appropriate contact with the
     SJA and law enforcement personnel and will document the unusual or suspicious activity
     in a memorandum for record. (T-2)
  3.1.4. The observer must:
     3.1.4.1. Be available for urinalysis drug testing whenever designated or ordered to
     perform observer duties. (T-3)
     3.1.4.2. Direct the member to rinse his/her hands with only water and dry them prior to
     providing a specimen. (T-3) Members may be allowed to wash their hands with soap and
     water or hand sanitizer after providing a sample and securing the lid on the bottle.
     3.1.4.3. Directly observe the urine leaving the member’s body and entering the specimen
     bottle. (T-3)
         3.1.4.3.1. If a female member chooses to use the optional wide-mouth specimen
         container cup, the observer must directly observe the following: the member
         providing the specimen, pouring the specimen into an approved specimen bottle, and
         securing the lid tightly to the bottle. (T-3)
     3.1.4.4. Ensure that the member providing the specimen secures the lid tightly on the
     bottle and that it is not reopened by the member or anyone else at the collection site. (T-
     3) Maintain the bottle in line of sight at all times. (T-3) Members may be allowed to
     clean their hands after providing a sample and securing the lid on the bottle.
         3.1.4.4.1. Ensure the specimen bottle is returned to the DTPAM immediately after
         the urine collection or any attempted urine collection that does not result in the
         required minimum 30 milliliters of urine during one attempt. (T-3)
            3.1.4.4.1.1. If less than the required 30 milliliters of urine is collected, the
            observer must escort the member to the DTPAM who will verify the insufficient
            volume. (T-3) The DTPAM, upon verification of insufficient volume, will direct
            the member to discard the specimen. (T-3) The observer must witness the
            discarding of the specimen by the member. (T-3) The bottle will be returned to
AFI90-507 22 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                     35

     the bottle. (T-3)
     3.1.4.6. Sign, initial, and print his or her name in the ledger. (T-3) This certifies that the
     observer directly witnessed the member urinating into the specimen bottle. If a wide
     mouth cup is used for females, the observer is certifying that she directly witnessed the
     member urinating into the wide-mouth cup and transferring the urine into the specimen
     bottle. (T-3)
     3.1.4.7. If an error is made in the documentation associated with a urine specimen, see
     paragraph 4.1.2 and refer to Attachment 15 for guidance on forensic documentation and
     acceptable methods for correcting errors on forensic documentation.
  3.1.5. Public Health Measures.
     3.1.5.1. DDRPMs/DTPAMs should consult with their installation Public Health offices
     to establish local procedures for allowing members to clean their hands after providing a
     urine sample. For example:
     3.1.5.2. Other measures of hand cleaning, e.g., skin-approved wipe (disinfectant or plain
     (e.g., baby wipe) ) or alcohol-based sanitizer, may be used as well as washing with soap
     and water after the specimen has been collected and the lid secured on the bottle. This
     could be in the bathroom if soap dispensers are not available but should be provided in
     the area where the specimens are taped and initialed, since there may be residual urine on
     the cup/hands or from common-use pens. (T-3)
     3.1.5.3. If a common pen is used, it could be wiped off with a wipe after each person
     uses it. Otherwise, everyone could be required to use their own personal pens.
     Alternatively, wipes could be made available if someone wants to wipe the pen down
     (this would be wipes put next to the pen on the table top, not wipes kept in another
     location that must be retrieved).
     3.1.5.4. Collectors must wear disposable gloves when handling specimen containers,
     which may have been contaminated with urine and merely dried off with a paper towel.
     (T-3)
  3.1.6. Special Considerations. (T-1)
     3.1.6.1. Specimens that are solely for clinical diagnosis (i.e., medical evaluations,
     ADAPT Program enrollment, aircraft incidents/accidents) should not be submitted to the
     drug testing laboratory. (T-1)          Specimens obtained as a result of aircraft
     incidents/accidents must be collected by the MTF laboratory and submitted to the
     AFMES. (T-1) See AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations & Records. All
     others as defined for clinical diagnosis may be processed locally. (T-1)
         3.1.6.1.1. Collection, packaging, and shipping of specimens for all aircraft mishaps
         and/or fatalities involving RegAF members is the responsibility of Flight Medicine.
         (T-1) (See AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations & Records.) DDRPMs
         and/or DTPAMs may provide assistance upon request. (T-1)

     3.1.6.2. DDRPMs, DTPAMs, and observers, who are military members or civilian
     employees in Testing Designated Positions, must be included in a random drug testing
     program, but collections and mailing must be completed by other qualified individuals.
     (T-1) DDRPMs, DTPAMs, and observers will not participate in any collection in which
     they provided specimens. (T-1) Collection of urine specimens from these personnel may
     be conducted in a special, separate collection session so that the tested DDRPMs,
     DTPAMs, or observers can participate in collection sessions involving the general
     population. In special circumstances, the DDRPM should consult the local SJA who will
     assist in developing and documenting a process that minimizes opportunities for anyone
     to influence the collection and shipment of his/her urine specimen. (T-1)
     3.1.6.3. If a specimen is certified positive and the member has departed due to
     PCS/Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA), the losing unit commander will notify the
     gaining unit commander by message and send a copy of the message to the gaining
     MTF/CC. (T-3)
  3.1.7. After Hours Collection. The DDRPM/DTPAM, in consultation with the SJA, will
  establish procedures to periodically collect and secure specimens outside normal duty hours,
  including weekends and holidays. (T-3)

            4.6.1.1.2.1. The mailer box must be sealed using the kit box seal. (T-3) Apply
            the signed and dated seal to the mailer box ensuring a portion of the date and
            signature is across the open edge of the box. (T-3) If the kit box seal does not
            adhere, use any effective glue to attach the kit box seal. (T-3)
  4.6.2. It is highly recommended that STKs be mailed separately. However, if the STKs are
  mailed in a single shipment, the secondary (outer) container must be sealed IAW the
  guidelines established in Section D, paragraph 8. (T-3) The individual test kits must be
  prepared and sealed as outlined above in paragraph 4.4. (T-3) Do not use confetti-type or
  popcorn shipping fillers. (T-3)
     4.6.2.1. To eliminate a potential challenge to the chain of custody of the specimens, the
     STK or shipping box containing several STKs should be mailed or shipped immediately
     after it is prepared for shipment. (T-3) If this is not possible, the sealed STK or shipping
     box should be placed in secured storage under chain of custody. (T-3) The chain of
     custody must be maintained and documented until the sealed STK or shipping box is
     dispatched. (T-3)
  4.6.3. For GSU testing:
     4.6.3.1. The GSU DTPAM will mail all urine specimens collected for drug testing
     directly to the AFDTL (or appropriate lab designated by MAJCOM) unless the servicing
     DDRPM requires the GSU to send samples to the servicing installation DDR office for
     QC review of samples. (T-3) PACAF mails urine specimens to Army Drug Lab at
     Tripler.
         4.6.3.1.1. In cases of QC checks performed by servicing DDR Office, the chain of
         custody must remain intact and documented. (T-3) The original chain of custody
         from the GSU must be annotated by the individual who opens and performs the
         quality review and ships the specimen(s) to the lab. (T-3) The sample should not be
         shipped in the same box it was received and may be shipped in a new container or
         with the installation shipment of specimens. (T-3)
         4.6.3.1.2. A sample that has discrepancies will be reviewed by the local SJA and SJA
         will make a determination of action to include possible re-collection of the untestable
         sample. (T-3) The DDRPM/DTPAM will ensure the GSU DTPAM understands the
         discrepancy to preclude re-occurrence. (T-3)
     4.6.3.2. In all cases, the GSU DTPAM must ensure that the specimens are mailed within
     two duty days of collection using one of the transportation modes outlined in chapter 8.
     (T-3) Specimens not mailed within two working days will require a MFR explaining the

   6.1.1. The drug laboratory establishes written internal chain of custody procedures. (T-3)
   6.1.2. The drug testing laboratory receives the chain of custody shipment of specimens.
   6.1.3. Employees are trained and certified to perform duties in the Specimen Control Section
   of the Drug Testing Laboratory: (T-3)
      6.1.3.1. Visually inspect each shipment box to determine if the box was sealed properly,
      or if the box appears to have been opened or tampered with while in transit. (T-3)
      6.1.3.2. Open the sealed box or mailer and inventory the bottles to ensure specimen
      integrity, locate the DD Form 2624, sign and date the DD Form 2624, annotate the mode
      of transportation by which the specimens were received at the laboratory, and describe
      the condition of the seals on the shipping package in the remarks block of DD Form 2624
      or complete an MFR if appropriate. (T-3)
      6.1.3.3. Inspect each bottle and closely examine the tamper evident tape to determine if it
      is intact. (T-3) If the tape on a bottle is broken on receipt, the sample is not tested unless
      the discrepancy is explained. (T-3) A notation is made by the drug testing lab personnel
      on the DD Form 2624 to identify those bottles that arrived at the laboratory with the
      tamper evident tape broken. (T-3)
      6.1.3.4. Inspect each bottle to ensure that it contains a minimum of 30 milliliters of urine,
      and is not adulterated. (T-3) Volumes below 30 milliliters may not be tested. (T-3)
          6.1.3.4.1. Annotate DD Form 2624 to reflect the discrepancy, and ensure submitting
          unit is informed of the discrepancy. (T-3) A discrepancy letter should be sent to the
          submitting unit for any discrepancy which is not self-explanatory or needs
          explanation. (T-3)
          6.1.3.4.2. Consult the laboratory legal advisor concerning urine testing discrepancy
          resolution. (T-3) Ask the laboratory legal advisor to recommend to the laboratory
          commander resolution if there is a question regarding chain of custody or integrity of
          the specimen. (T-3)
      6.1.3.5. Assign laboratory specimen accession numbers, and label each original
      specimen bottle and the cap of the bottle to ensure proper identification. (T-3)
      6.1.3.6. Keep original specimen bottles secured in a controlled access area at all times
      until destruction is authorized. (T-3)
      6.1.3.7. Prepare portions (aliquots) of each specimen for screen testing and if necessary,
      rescreen and confirmation testing, and maintain a chain of custody on aliquots using
      appropriate chain of custody documents. (T-3)
      6.1.3.8. Until specimen analysis is completed, laboratory personnel processing the
      specimen or the aliquot taken from it will ensure that the appropriate chain of custody
      document is properly signed, dated, and annotated when the sample is received or
 48                                                         AFI90-507 22 SEPTEMBER 2014


      released during analysis. (T-3) The individual maintaining custody of the sample or
      aliquot must safeguard the sample or aliquot at all times. (T-3)
          6.1.3.8.1. Once a specimen has been tested and identified as negative by either
          screen, rescreen, or confirmation testing for all drug classes requested, the specimen
          is released from the chain of custody and destroyed, unless the specimen is to be used
          for method development or research purposes. (T-3) In this event, after annotation of
          destruction on chain of custody, all identifying information will be removed. (T-3)
6.2. Laboratory Chain of Custody Requirements After Analysis.
   6.2.1. After specimen analysis is completed, the individual designated by the Commander,
   Drug Testing Laboratory:
      6.2.1.1. Certifies the results on the DD Form 2624 and reports results to the originating
      agency. (T-3)
      6.2.1.2. Reports as negative any specimen that fails to meet or exceed the established
      DoD minimum concentration for determination as positive for a drug on either the initial
      screening test, rescreening test, or confirmatory test. (T-3)
      6.2.1.3. Ensures for specimens confirmed positive that all results of testing conducted in
      the laboratory, including applicable printouts, tracings, and chain of custody documents,
      remain on file secured in the drug laboratory or in a secured storage area. (T-3)
      6.2.1.4. Stores specimens confirmed positive in a frozen state in a secure area under
      proper chain of custody document. (T-3)
          6.2.1.4.1. Keeps a military member’s frozen specimen and that of a military
          accession applicant for one calendar year, at the end of which time it is destroyed
          unless the originating agency has requested that it be retained or the specimen is to be
          used for method development or research purposes. (T-3)
          6.2.1.4.2. If the originating agency requests retention for a longer period, the
          laboratory will maintain the specimen for the requested period. (T-3) The originating
          agency must specify a defined period of time (e.g., six months). (T-3) A request for
          “indefinite retention” will not be honored by the laboratory. At the end of this
          additional retention period, the laboratory will destroy the sample IAW paragraph
          6.2.1.4.1 unless the originating agency requests a further retention. (T-3) When this
          occurs, the requesting agency must advise the laboratory every 60 calendar days of
          the need for further retention. (T-3) The SJA from the originating agency notifies the
          drug testing laboratory legal advisor when further retention of the specimen is not
          necessary. (T-3)
          6.2.1.4.3. The individual who destroys a stored specimen annotates, signs, and dates
          the appropriate chain of custody document. (T-3)

 NOTES                        s
 1. Administrative actions include, but are not limited to, letters of admonishment, counseling and
 reprimands, denial of re-enlistment, removal from Personal Reliability Program (PRP), removal
 from duties involving firearms, removal from flying status or sensitive duties, suspension of
 security clearance, and removal of restricted area badges. If there are any questions regarding
 actions authorized for positive drug test results, consult the local servicing SJA.
 2. Inspections under Military Rules of Evidence (MRE) 313(b) include inspections under
 the installation’s random urinalysis drug testing program and unit or gate sweeps.
 3. Probable cause tests are authorized searches and seizures ordered by a military
 magistrate or appropriate commander (See MRE 315 and 316).
 4. Absent probable cause, commander directed results may not be used for
 disciplinary action under the UCMJ or to characterize an administrative separation.
 EXCEPTION: Commander directed results may be offered for impeachment purposes
 or in rebuttal in any proceeding in which a service member first introduces evidence in
 a proceeding to infer or support a claim of non-use of drugs.
 5. Members may not be disciplined under the UCMJ when they legitimately self-identify for
 drug abuse and enter the ADAPT Program. In the interests of unit safety and security,
 commanders may initiate non-adverse administrative actions such as removal from flying
 status, removal from the PRP, removal of restricted area badges, etc. Urinalysis tests of
 individuals following entry into the ADAPT Program are for valid medical purposes.
 Individuals in the ADAPT Program may also be disciplined under the UCMJ when
 independent evidence of drug use is obtained.
 6. Urine specimens obtained from an examination for a valid medical purpose may be used for
 any purpose.
AFI90-507 22 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    55


7.6. Inability To Provide A Urine Specimen.
   7.6.1. Since members have been required to provide urine samples in direct observation
   since basic training, commands should take all precautions to ensure the member is not
   attempting to defeat the drug testing process. (T-2) If a member claims to be unable to
   provide a sample during the command’s collection period, the member shall be turned over
   to the command and remain under observation at all times until a sample is provided. (T-2)
   If, after a period of 8 hours, the member still cannot provide a urine sample, member shall be
   examined by a military medical authority to investigate possibility of physical problems. (T-
   3) Under no circumstances will an otherwise healthy person, unable or unwilling to provide
   a sample, be catherized solely for the purpose of obtaining a urine sample. (T-2)
   7.6.2. Examination should be completed the same day of the collection and documented in
   member’s medical record. (T-3) If failure to provide a sample is a chronic problem, member
   shall be sent to the MTF for further evaluation. (T-3)

          All counternarcotics programs are funded through Central Transfer Account from
          DASD/CN. An A40 limitation is placed on these funds, which means funds cannot
          be added to or subtracted from the amount provided by SAF/FMBO. (T-3) This also
          means funds may not be reprogrammed out of the program for non-counter narcotics
          purposes, nor executed for non-counternarcotic activities. (T-3)
          7.7.1.1.2. DDRPMs/DTPAMs provide monthly obligation data, to include medical
          supply transactions, from Defense Medical Logistics Supply System (DMLSS) to

        laboratory operations. Requests for realignment must be submitted by MAJCOM,
        through AFMOA/SGHW to OSD/PR for approval. (T-3)                Once approved,
        SAF/FMBOO will issue a funding authorization document re-aligning funds to
        facilitate full execution. (T-3)
            7.7.1.1.3.1. Responsibility Center/Cost Center (RCCC) XX5950 and other

tape.
Collector—General designation referring to the DTPAM.
Community Outreach—Defined as on and off base prevention, drug education/awareness and
deterrence activities targeted to DoD family members, retirees, civilians and contractors.
Consent Testing—Prior to a probable cause or commander-directed urinalysis test, first ask the
member if he or she will consent to a urinalysis test. Commanders are not required to give
Article 31, UCMJ, rights prior to asking for consent; however, evidence that a member was read
these rights may be used to help demonstrate the member’s consent was voluntary. Results may
be used for UCMJ or administrative actions, including adverse characterization of administrative
discharges. Consent is not valid if it is mere acquiescence to authority. See Military Rule of
Evidence (MRE) 314(e). While not required, it is best to obtain the member’s consent in
writing.
AFI90-507 22 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                      61


Drug—Any controlled substance included in Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V in 21 U.S.C. 812,
including anabolic or androgenic steroids, or any intoxicating substance other than alcohol, that
is inhaled, injected, consumed, or introduced into the body in any manner to alter mood or
function.
Drug Abuse—The wrongful use, possession, distribution, or introduction onto a military
installation, or other property or facility under military supervision, of a controlled substance,
prescription medication, over-the-counter medication, or intoxicating substance (other than
alcohol) .
―Wrongful means without legal justification or excuse, and includes use contrary to the
directions of the manufacturer or prescribing healthcare provider, and use of any intoxicating
substance not intended for human ingestion. (For purposes of this Instruction, drug abuse also
includes inhalant abuse (sometimes referred to as ―huffing) and steroid usage other than that
specifically prescribed by a competent medical authority.) For prescription medication, the mere
passage of time does not necessarily render the use or possession of an otherwise validly
prescribed medication wrongful. Violators are subject to punitive action under the UCMJ and/or
adverse administrative actions.
Drug Demand Reduction Program Manager (DDRPM)—Individual hired or appointed by the
installation commander or equivalent to be responsible for oversight of the military and civilian
drug testing programs and drug outreach, education, and prevention. Also responsible for
training and certifying assigned DTPAMs for specimen collection.
Drug Testing Program Administrative Manager (DTPAM)—Individual hired or appointed
by the installation commander or equivalent to administer collection, processing, and shipping of
specimens and safeguarding of applicable information pertaining to the drug testing program.
EXODUS testing—Testing of technical students returning from the Christmas/New Year’s
holiday break.
Field Testing—Any drug urinalysis testing which is performed outside of the Air Force Drug
Testing Laboratory, a DoD certified drug testing laboratory, or a Department of Health and
Human Service (HHS) drug testing laboratory, employing methodology which is defined as a
rapid screening test.
Geographically Separated Unit (GSU)—Units that physically reside outside of the host unit.
GSU DTPAM—An individual appointed by the senior officer at a GSU entrusted to safeguard
and manage the collection and shipping aspects of the drug urinalysis program.
Inspection Testing—Random inspection testing is the best deterrent presently available against
drug abuse. Urine specimens may be ordered as part of an inspection under Military Rule of
Evidence (MRE) 313(b). Inspections may be conducted to determine: if the command is
functioning properly; if proper standards of readiness are maintained; and if personnel are
present, fit and ready for duty. Individual members may not be singled out. An entire unit or a
part of the unit may be inspected or may be an installation-wide random selection process.
Results may be used for UCMJ or administrative actions, including adverse characterizations of
administrative discharges. In the case of United States v. Bickel, 30 MJ 277 (CMA, 1990), a
properly conducted random urinalysis constitutes an inspection under MRE 313 in an effort to
determine/ensure the security/fitness, good order, and discipline of a unit. In Bickel, the Court of
 62                                                           AFI90-507 22 SEPTEMBER 2014


Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces) held that properly conducted
“follow-up” urinalyses after an initial positive result are simply an extension of the original
urinalysis; thus, all succeeding positive results are part of the same original random inspection.
Operating Instruction (OI)—Technical and policy procedures generated and used by the drug
testing laboratory governing specific aspects of specimen analysis.
Observer—A service member assigned duty to observe the collection of urine specimens from
service members.
Probable Cause—Requires a search and seizure authorization from the appropriate commander
to seize a urine specimen. Probable cause exists when there is a reasonable belief that drugs will
be found in the system of the member to be tested. See MRE 315(f) and consult with the SJA
regarding procedures for determining whether there is probable cause. Results may be used for
UCMJ or to characterize administrative discharges.
Rehabilitation Urine Testing—Rehabilitation testing is a form of commander-directed testing.
A member in drug rehabilitation will be urine tested on a no-notice basis. The unit commander
may discontinue rehabilitation urine testing once a courts-martial or separation action is initiated
on a member in rehabilitation.
Secure Storage—Secure storage is an area used to store all materials and specimens that hold
the potential of being useful as evidence in a court proceeding or administrative hearing. Its
level of security must be on par with evidence storage security used by law enforcement. At a
minimum, a secure storage area must be maintained with access limited and controlled by
appropriate procedures and the two layers of locks or other devices to prevent unauthorized
access.
Trusted Agent—An individual appointed by unit commanders to receive and maintain rosters of
individuals (notification letter from the collector) selected for urinalysis testing. The Trusted
Agent is responsible for notifying, via commander’s order, individuals selected for urinalysis
testing and identifying those individuals unavailable for testing.

                        SAMPLE COLLECTION SITE CHECKLIST

A3.1. Verify the identification of each individual through a valid military identification (ID)
card. Maintain possession of the individual’s military card until the collection process is
completed.
A3.2. Enter the following information in the urine drug testing ledger or register: Month, day,
and year of collection; BIDN, batch number, and specimen number; the individual’s complete
social security number (SSN); the individual’s rank; individual’s initials and printed name; time
the member provided his/her specimen.
A3.3. Ensure that specimen bottles are clean and do not have holes. If a pre-printed bottle label
is not available, ensure the following information is annotated on the bottle: collection month,
day, and year; BIDN; and the individual’s complete SSN.
A3.4. Hand the empty specimen bottle to the individual. Have the individual inspect the bottle
in the presence of the designated same-gendered observer to make sure it is clean and free of
debris. Instruct the individual to carry the specimen bottle so that it is in the view of the observer
at all times. For GSUs, break the seal of the STK in the presence of the individual.
A3.5. Direct the individual providing the specimen to remove bulky outer garments (e.g.,
ABU/BDU blouse), if direct observation by the observer may be impeded. Also, have the donor
remove any genital piercing jewelry and thereafter wash hands with water only.
A3.6. After the individual and observer return, receive the urine specimen from the individual,
visually check for adulteration, and ensure the urine volume is a minimum of 30 milliliters. (If
contamination or adulteration is suspected, or the individual provides insufficient quantity, direct
the individual to remain in the area until an acceptable sample is collected). In the event the
individual provides an insufficient volume, the DTPAM will void the bottle (with the label) and
the entry in the ledger or register. The DTPAM will annotate the logbook as Quantity Not
Sufficient or QNS. The DTPAM in turn will direct the individual to discard the specimen. The
observer must witness the discarding of the specimen by the individual. The bottle will be
returned to the DTPAM who will dispose of it IAW Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) guidelines.
A3.7. Have the individual initial and sign (payroll signature) by their printed name in the ledger
after verifying that the SSN annotated on the bottle label matches the entries in the ledger or
register.
A3.8. If sufficient volume is collected, the DTPAM will in the presence of the individual apply
tamper-resistant tape (conforming to the shape of the bottle to minimize tearing) extending from
approximately halfway down and over the gummed label (not obliterating any identifying
information), across the bottle cap, and to an approximate midpoint on the other side of the
specimen bottle.
A3.9. Have the individual initial and date the bottle label to certify the SSN and other
identifying information on the specimen bottle is correct, that the member witnessed the
application of the tamper-resistant tape, and that the specimen in the bottle is the individual’s.
AFI90-507 22 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  65


A3.10. Have the observer date and initial the bottle label on the line marked OB INIT to certify
the integrity of the collection process and that the urine is the individual’s.
A3.11. Have the observer print his/her name where designated in the ledger, initial, and sign
his/her payroll signature next to the individual’s entry.
A3.12. Maintain line-of-sight custody of collected specimens during the collection process or
place the specimen in secured storage with proper chain of custody entries (on DD Form 2624).

SUBJECT: Untestable Specimen Action Plan

1. The purpose of this letter is to update you on our recent untestable discrepancy and corrective
actions.

2. Installation X recently received twelve untestables on 6 May 2004 from Air Force Drug
Testing Lab. The specimen numbers were: F5310000000, F5310000000, F531000000,
F5310000000, F5310000000, F5310000000, F5310000000, F531000000, F5310000000,
F5310000000, F5310000000, and F531000000. The untestable discrepancy code was PA. The
photocopy received from Brooks indicates an obvious straight cut on the seal of the box. Since
we double tape, this cut could not have been made by tearing open the box. Sample
F531000000 was identified SC (quantity not sufficient).

3. The MAJCOM/SGOC has authority to remove untestable discrepancies from the installation
untestable statistics. [Installation Demand Reduction office symbol] requests MAJCOM/SGOC
remove the 12 (PA) untestables from our untestable statistics based on the premise we have no
control over samples once they leave our facility. We will retest members based on the
factor that the samples were not tested at the Air Force facility. The one sample of
Insufficient Quantity should remain an untestable due to our error. Please initial your
decision and send to Fax: DSN 975-0999.

                   GUIDELINES FOR FORENSIC DOCUMENTATION

A15.1. Overview. All documents created during urine specimen collection testing are
considered forensic documents. Chain-of-custody (CoC) documentation provides a legal record
of all personnel who handled the specimen from the time of collection until the specimen is
destroyed. This set of guidelines provides procedures for correcting forensic documents and
guidelines for preserving and disposing of these documents.
A15.2. External/Collection Chain-Of-Custody. The external chain-of-custody document is
the DD Form 2624. The DD Form 2624 documents custody from the time of urine collection
and shipment to receipt at the laboratory. The external chain-of-custody contains specimen
identification information, social security number, submitting unit identification, date of
collection and type of collection. Changes in custody are documented using the z type format.
The z type format requires a Received By and Released By annotation for each transfer of
custody. (T-2) The reason for the change of custody or action performed is documented in the
Purpose of Change/Remarks column.(T-2)
A15.3. Forensic Corrections. Forensic documents are subject to errors like any other
document. However, procedures used to correct errors on forensic documents are different than
normal documents. Corrections to forensic documents must be clear, concise, and consistent. (T-
3) Forensic corrections should document the nature of the correction, not eliminate evidence that
an error or omission occurred. (T-3) To accomplish this, corrections should be made so that the
original entry is preserved, that the correct data is readily apparent, and that the identity of the
individual who made the correction and the date of the correction are clear. (T-3) In some cases
a memorandum for record (MFR) may be necessary to clarify any uncertainty relating to the
correction.
a. Strike out corrections. (T-3) Correction fluid (whiteout), erasures, or write-overs are not
   acceptable methods for correcting forensic documents.

1. Draw a single line through the incorrect data and record the correct information as close as
   possible to the incorrect entry (typically above or beside the line in question). (T-3) If
   multiple lines need to be corrected, draw the strike out line in a manner such that it is
   continuous. (T-3) A diagonal line from one end of the correction to the other end may be
   used. A continuous line employing a curve from one line to the next is also acceptable.

2. Initial and date the correction.(T-3)

3. This type of correction can be used for incorrect entries, illegible entries, and other similar
   types of minor errors. Corrections to chain-of-custody entries not made by the end of the
   same shift of the following business day may require an MFR.

b. Omission corrections. Forensic documents that are missing a required entry require a special
   type of forensic correction. (t-3) It is important to provide the correct information and reflect
   that the entry was made after the fact.
 90                                                            AFI90-507 22 SEPTEMBER 2014


1. Verify that the task was originally completed correctly and that only the required entry was
   missing. (T-3) Make the appropriate entry as it would have been made originally (e.g., name
   stamps, dates, entries in the remarks column, etc.). (T-3)

2. Draw a circle around the entry and add your initials and the date of the correction.(T-3)

c. Corrections to forensic corrections. Occasionally an error is made while making a
   forensic correction. Use the same techniques described above to correct the error. (T-3)

1. Correct a forensic correction only once. If on the correction to a forensic correction an
   additional error is made, do not attempt to correct it again. (T-3) In these cases an MFR
   should be written describing what the correct information was supposed to be. (T-3)

d. Corrections performed after the fact or by other individuals. The person who made the
   original entry should make forensic corrections on errors or omissions. Corrections made
   after the fact by the person who made the original entry do not require a MFR if the
   situation can be readily interpreted from the available documentation. If it is impossible or
   impractical for that individual to make the correction, a supervisor/production leader or
   LCO can make the correction if the nature of the error and the appropriate correction are
   clear and unmistakable (e.g. can be verified from the document itself). Simple
   corrections that satisfy these requirements do not require an MFR.

e. Corrections best made by MFR. If the nature of the error and the appropriate correction is
   not clear or easily understood, an MFR is the best tool to use to provide a more thorough
   explanation. The individual involved in the original error, the supervisor/production
   leader, or an LCO making the forensic correction can write the MFR. MFRs are normally
   the best tool to use when the nature of the error and/or the forensic correction is such that it
   could raise questions about the reliability of the procedures employed.

A.15.4. Memorandum For Record (MFR).

a. An MFR is an official record prepared to document and clarify situations, irregularities,
   or deviations from the standard operating procedures that based on the document and
   corrections alone would not be apparent or explainable. MFRs are written or adopted as true
   and accurate by the person who signs the MFR. An MFR becomes a permanent part of the
   original documentation and will be included in any urinalysis report for affected specimens.

b. MFRs should be clear, concise, typewritten, and reflect the same care in preparation that
   is typically applied to all other activities within the laboratory. (T-3) Elements of a helpful
   MFR include:

1. Which sample or samples were affected?

2. What happened? Be concise, thorough and to-the-point.

3. When did the incident happen? Include the date of the incident and the date the MFR was
   prepared.

4. Where did the incident happen? Where refers to the section of the laboratory or room
   number.

5. How was the problem resolved?

6. Who was involved?

c. MFRs must be signed in writing. (T-3) Use of signature stamps or signature replacements
   (e.g.: //SIGNED//) is prohibited.(T-3)

 GUIDELINES FOR DRUG DEMAND REDUCTION PROGRAM (DDRP) FACILITIES

A16.1. Overview. The installation commander or equivalent must ensure the Drug Demand
Reduction Program is given adequate, appropriate, and dedicated space for collection operations,
administration, storage of supplies and secure storage of specimens. (T-3) Adequate space
enables efficient collection operations, improves the forensic soundness of specimen collection
and shipment, and builds confidence in the Program by service members. These factors enhance
the program’s effectiveness at deterring drug abuse.
A16.2. Space Requirements. These guidelines are based on a tested population of
approximately 2,000. Actual space required will need to be adjusted based upon the actual
population at specific installations. (T-3) Other factors to be considered are the testing hours,
number of collectors and number of observers. The Installation Civil Engineer should be able to
assist in developing a more fine-tuned standard.
a. Two Administrative Offices. DDRPM Office: Approx. 120 SF; DTPAM Office:
Approx. 120 SF. These offices need to be secure for computer equipment, fax machine, and
sensitivity of drug testing related data, information, and files. (T-3)

b. Drug Testing Waiting Space: Approx. 300-400 SF. Needs to be relatively close to the
offices and restrooms with enough space to accommodate at least 50 people. (T-3)

c. Secure Storage Space: Approx. 100 SF. It is essential for the drug testing program to
have secure storage space for drug testing supplies. Secure storage is an area used to
store all materials and specimens that hold the potential of being used as evidence in a court
proceeding or administrative hearing. Its level of security must be on par with evidence
storage security used by law enforcement. (T-3) At a minimum, a secure storage area must be
maintained with access limited and controlled by appropriate procedures and the two layers of
locks or other devices to prevent unauthorized access. (T-3) Storage space required for drug
abuse prevention supplies, outreach-related materials, and administrative office supplies is also
needed.

d. Restrooms: Male: 3 urinals, 1 stall; Female: 2 stalls. Restrooms need adequate space
between urinals allowing donors and required observers to be in the restrooms simultaneously
to facilitate collections. If there are no secured restrooms, these restrooms would need to be
closed off for public use during testing times. (T-3) Automatic flushers, water faucets, and
towel dispensers (or air dryers) would facilitate cleanliness and program integrity.

e. Training/Briefing Room: Approx. 240 SF. Need space to hold drug testing related
trainings such as Trusted Agent, Observer, and Drug Free Workplace Briefings/Training. (T-3)

f. Parking: Relatively close to the building for approx. 20 vehicles.
