MEMORANDUM FOR

FROM: 412 TW/CC
      195 E Popson Ave
      Edwards AFB, CA

SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum to Edwards Air Force Base Instruction 13-213.

       By Order of the Edwards Air Force Base Commander, this Edwards Air Force Base
Guidance Memorandum (GM) immediately changes Edwards Air Force Base Instruction 13-
213. Compliance with this Memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are
inconsistent with other Edwards Air Force Base publications, the information herein prevails, in
accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. This GM (1) adds Wing
Safety as an authority to revoke/suspend airfield driving privileges, (2) adds that the Tower will
use runway lights to communicate with vehicles in the event of radio and light gun failure, (3)
adds the phraseology the Tower will use when starting and ending uncontrolled airfield
operations, (4) removes Towlane H Helipads and (5) adds that Airfield Management personnel
conducting the daily airfield inspection are exempt from contacting the Tower each and every
time they proceed onto or leave the CMA. Attachment 1 of this Guidance Memorandum
provides new guidance and procedures for the outlined paragraphs and tables for the basic
EDWARDSAFBI13-213.

       This Memorandum becomes void after one year has elapsed from the date of this
Memorandum, or upon incorporation by interim change to, or rewrite of Edwards Air Force
Base Instruction 13-213, whichever is earlier.




                                                 MICHAEL T. BREWER

to communicate with vehicles and pedestrians. If light gun signals are unsuccessful, the Tower
will flash the runway edge lights on and off to alert vehicle operators/pedestrians on the runway
that there is a problem and/or emergency that requires them to immediately exit the runway. If
all of the above fails, contact Airfield Management to have vehicle and/or pedestrian traffic
escorted off the CMA. NOTE: Light gun signals are not used for vehicles on North Base, South
Base, and on the lakebeds due to distances and visibility restrictions.

2.8.5. Prior to closing, tower will broadcast on all frequencies and nets (except guard):
“ATTENTION ALL PERSONNEL, THE TOWER AND AIRFIELD WILL BE CLOSING IN 5
MINUTES, UNCONTROLLED AIRFIELD OPERATIONS WILL BE IN EFFECT.”

THE BLIND.”

2.8.6. Prior to opening, tower will broadcast on all frequencies and nets (except guard):
“ATTENTION ALL PERSONNEL, TOWER AND AIRFIELD WILL OPEN IN FIVE
MINUTES. ALL AIRCRAFT IN THE CLASS DELTA AND ALL VEHICLE OPERATORS IN
THE CMA CHECK IN WITH CALL SIGN AND POSITION.”

2.8.6.1. Upon opening, tower will broadcast on all frequencies and nets (except guard):
“ATTENTION ALL PERSONNEL, TOWER AND AIRFIELD ARE NOW OPEN.

  unless the operator is being trained specifically in the duties that require such operation.
  4.2.20. Turn off vehicle headlights shining toward a moving aircraft at night so the pilot will
  not be blinded or have their night vision affected. Turn on vehicle parking lights to show
  position until aircraft is out of range. Vehicles with day-time running lights must be
  positioned in such a manner that the headlights are not directed towards the aircraft. Use
  emergency warning flashers (directional signals front and rear) when parked on airfield at
  night or during inclement weather.
  4.2.21. If required to leave a vehicle unattended on the airfield, it will be parked in an
  approved parking area. Drivers will turn off the vehicle and leave keys in ignition, place
  transmission in reverse (manual) or park (automatic), set parking brake, and leave the vehicle
  unlocked. All powered vehicles and equipment mounted on wheels without integral braking
  systems must use wheel chocks. NOTE: When vehicles are parked on the airfield in
  designated parking spots (where parking spots are marked on the pavement), the vehicle may
  be secured and the keys removed. There are no designated vehicle parking spots on aircraft
  movement surfaces. Vehicles may be left unattended while servicing aircraft, but must be

                      AIRFIELD SIGNS, MARKINGS AND LIGHTS

5.1. Airfield Signs. Airfield signs are classified as mandatory and informational. These signs
are internally lit during hours of darkness. The illustrations below show only examples of such
signs used at Edwards AFB. Other airfields may have other types of signs in these categories.
5.2. Informational Signs. Information and guidance signs provide aircrews and airfield drivers
with direction to a taxiway and what taxiway they are on. Examples of signs used at Edwards
are listed below:
   5.2.1. Taxiway direction sign. This sign indicates the direction to a specific taxiway.
   Direction signs are black lettering on a yellow back ground.

Figure 5.1. Taxiway Direction Sign




   5.2.2. Taxiway Location sign. This sign indicates the taxiway you are on. Location signs
   are yellow lettering on a black background.

Figure 5.2. Taxiway Location Sign




   5.2.3. Taxiway sign arrays. These signs provide aircrew and drivers with directions to
   specific taxiways and indicate the taxiway they are on. The sign below indicates the aircrew
   or driver is located on taxiway A, and provides direction to taxiways B, C and D. In this
   example, taxiway D runs perpendicular to taxiway A, and extends in both directions.

Figure 5.3. Taxiway Sign Array




   5.2.4. Runway exit signs. Runway exit signs are taxiway direction signs located on runways
   to indicate the location of a specific taxiway at an exit point.

Figure 5.4. Runway Exit Sign
EDWARDSAFBI13-213 15 JANUARY 2014                                                                31


5.3. Mandatory Signs. Mandatory signs provide information such as runway designations,
VFR hold positions and stopping points.  Mandatory signs are white lettering on a red
background.
   5.3.1. Hold Signs. Hold signs indicate areas where aircraft and vehicles must stop and get
   instructions from the tower. These signs are located where the hold line markings are painted
   on the surface of the pavement. Operators must not proceed beyond this sign until given
   permission from the tower. The sign on the left indicates that you are at the approach end of
   runway 22L. The sign on the right indicates you are at an intermediate intersection, and that
   the approach end of runway 22L is to your left and the approach end of runway 4R is to your
   right.

Figure 5.5. Hold Signs




   5.3.2. Hold signs collocated with a location sign. This sign array contains both a hold sign,
   and taxiway location sign. This sign is indicating that the aircrew or driver is located on
   taxiway A, at the intersection of Runway 22L/4R. The approach end of runway 22L is to the
   aircrew or driver’s left, while the approach end of runway 4R is to the right.

Figure 5.6. Location Sign




5.4. Airfield Markings. The markings on the airfield convey information to both aircrew and
airfield drivers. All airfield markings are retro-reflective and should be easily seen at night when
exposed to head lights or landing gear lights. Examples of the markings used at Edwards AFB
are listed below.
   5.4.1. VFR Runway Hold line. The following marking defines the boundary of the CMA. It
   consists of two solid yellow lines, and two dashed yellow lines. You must have permission
   from the tower to proceed beyond this line.

Figure 5.7. VFR Runway Hold Line Marking




   5.4.2. Taxiway/Apron Edge Marking. This marking defines the boundaries of the load
   bearing surface. Paved areas beyond the edge lines are not designed to bear the weight of
   anything heavier than a standard passenger vehicle. Heavy vehicles, such as aircraft tugs,
 32                                              EDWARDSAFBI13-213 15 JANUARY 2014


   must never be driven off concrete or marked roadways. The marking consists of two
   continuous solid yellow lines. Aircraft shall not taxi or be towed beyond these lines.
   Airfield drivers should be aware that this defines the aircraft movement area.

Figure 5.8. Taxiway/Apron Edge marking



   5.4.3. Taxilane Edge Marking. This marking defines the boundary of a taxilane. A taxilane
   is a taxiway that is connected to parking areas. It defines the collocated apron and taxilane
   edges. It consists of two dashed yellow lines, and extends the length of the taxilane.

Figure 5.9. Taxilane Edge Marking



   5.4.4. Closed Pavement Marking. This marking is an “X” indicating that the pavement area
   is closed to all aircraft operations (taxiing, towing, parking, etc.).

Figure 5.10. Closed Pavement Marking.




   5.4.5. Other Pavement Markings. In addition to airfield markings, there are security
   markings for restricted areas. Restricted areas are marked with a single red boundary line.
   Individuals with proper security documents (i.e., line badge) must enter these areas through
   the designated Entry Control Point (ECP). The ECP is a candy stripe pattern, in red and
   white as shown in the example below.

Figure 5.11. Entry Control Point Marking




5.5. Airfield Lights. Airfield lights come in the following colors; Red, Green, Blue, White and
Amber. The different colored lights are placed in specific areas of the airfield. Airfield drivers
should be aware of what color runway and taxiway edge lights are to keep situational awareness
during hours of darkness.
   5.5.1. Runway Lighting. Runways edges are identified with white lights spaced 200 feet
   apart. The ends of the runway are defined by red and green lights. Airfield drivers must exit
   the runway immediately by the most expeditious route possible if the lights begin flashing.
   The runways at Edwards AFB have elevated edge lights, and flush mounted threshold lights.

Figure 5.12. Runway Lights




   5.5.2. Taxiway Lighting. Taxiway and taxilane edges are marked with blue lights.
   Taxilane Foxtrot is lighted only on the south side of the taxilane. Taxiway Delta is not lit
   and is for daylight VFR operations only. Edwards uses both elevated and flush mounted
   taxiway lights.

              EMERGENCY RESPONSE VEHICLES AND PROCEDURES

6.1. Emergency Vehicles. Emergency vehicles, identified in AFFTCI 91-9 Response to
Aircraft Emergencies, responding to an emergency requiring runway or lakebed access will
obtain Tower authorization prior to entering the runway or lakebed.
6.2. Termination. Upon termination, emergency response vehicles, other than those essential to
aircraft safety, will resume travel via normal designated vehicle routes.
6.3. Procedures for Airfield Emergencies. Agencies responding to emergencies on the airfield
will use the following procedures:
   6.3.1. Airfield Management. Airfield Management personnel will respond to the approach
   end of the runway to await the arrival of in-flight emergencies (when possible). Airfield
   Management will enter the runway when instructed to do so by the ATCT. Airfield
   Management will remain on scene until all other vehicles have exited the runway.
   6.3.2. Security Forces. Security Forces will not respond onto the runway unless specifically
   requested by the incident commander (IC) or Airfield Management. The SFS response
   vehicle will position itself at that the base of the ATCT and wait for further instructions from
   the IC or Airfield Management. At no time will the SFS vehicle enter the CMA without an
   escort.
   6.3.3. Ambulance. The Ambulance will respond to Pad 26, 27 or 28 and await further
   instructions from the IC. At no time shall the ambulance proceed to the runway without being
   requested to do so by the IC. If the IC requests ambulance support, the ambulance must
   request permission from the ATCT before entering the CMA.
   6.3.4. Safety. Safety Office personnel will position themselves at the most appropriate
   location outside the CMA. Safety may proceed once the aircraft has landed and ATCT
   permission has been granted to enter the runway.
   6.3.5. Crash Recovery. Crash Recovery will respond to Bravo Taxiway, unless otherwise
   instructed by the IC. Crash Recovery will enter the runway with Fire Department vehicles
   but only after receiving permission from the ATCT.
   6.3.6. Fire Department. The Fire Department will have vehicles respond to Taxiways Alpha,
   Bravo, Charlie, and Golf based on aircraft type having the in-flight emergency. Fire
   Department personnel (Division 1, Chief 1, etc.) are the designated IC for in-flight and
   ground emergencies. Fire Department vehicles will enter the runway as directed by the
   ATCT. NOTE: Vehicle operators are not to assume they are free to proceed on to the
   runway. Drivers must call for themselves and receive permission from the Tower prior to
   proceeding.

                               AIRFIELD VEHICLE PASSES

7.1. Unit ADPM/VCO Responsibilities. Individual units will appoint an ADPM/VCO in
writing to 412 OSS/OSAM.
   7.1.1. Contractors participating in a combined test force (CTF) will work through the CTF
   ADPM/VCO for vehicle pass requests. Contractors performing airfield work outside a CTF
   will designate their own ADPM/VCO.
   7.1.2. All non-government owned vehicles must have an airfield vehicle pass prior to
   entering the airfield. The ADPM/VCO will be the focal point for all pass requests and will
   obtain passes from 412 OSS/OSAM. Maintain vehicle pass paperwork until superseded or no
   longer needed IAW AF RDS Table 13-01 Rule 01.00.
   7.1.3. The ADPM/VCO will distribute passes within the unit upon verifying operator
   training and development of internal controls to prevent abuse and misuse of the airfield
   passes. The ADPM/VCO will maintain a log of all individuals and/or vehicles to which
   passes are issued.
   7.1.4. The ADPM/VCO is responsible for recovering and revoking passes when individuals
   depart the organization or when passes are no longer required.
   7.1.5. The ADPM/VCO will document the loss of any pass, including the pass number, in a
   letter to 412 OSS/OSAM. The letter must accompany a new EAFB Form 5129 if a
   replacement pass is being requested. The ADPM/VCO and 412 OSS/OSAM will keep a copy
   of the letter documenting lost passes on file. ADPM/VCOs will conduct an annual pass
   revalidation upon expiration of issued passes. Inadequate unit pass control evidenced by
   violations of airfield vehicle operating procedures or improper use of vehicle airfield passes
   may result in withdrawal of all unit passes until proper controls are established. ADPM/VCO
   duties may be assigned concurrently with duties assigned to the unit VCO/VCNCO and/or
   the ADPM (AFI 24-301).
   7.1.6. Obtaining Passes. Requesting agency will send an original EAFB Form 5129 through
   their unit commander, CTF director, or respective staff office to 412 OSS/OSAM. Airfield
   pass requests initiated by AFTC staff offices, 412 TW three-letter offices, and contractors not
   assigned to a CTF may be signed by the chief of that activity in the unit commander block.
   Along with the EAFB Form 5129 must be accompanied by an EAFB Form 5129A. This form
   must be filled out and verified by unit ADPM/VCO for each individual requesting to drive a
   non-GOV on the flightline. Individuals with multiple vehicles can list both vehicles on the
   same EAFB Form 5129A. AM will only verify the EAFB Form 5129A is being
   accomplished but will return those forms to the requesting unit for safekeeping.
   7.1.7. It is essential that vehicle operations on the airfield be kept to an absolute minimum
   and that only authorized, trained drivers be allowed to operate a vehicle on the airfield. All
   vehicles except government motor vehicles and special purpose construction type vehicles
   require a color-coded pass to enter the airfield. Rental vehicles, obtained with TDY orders,
   are considered government vehicles when used for official business by DoD personnel but
   require the issuance of EAFB Form 5292 for accountability. IAW AFMAN 31-116, Air

   Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, official business rental vehicles may be used within
   restricted areas and to cross runways. Airfield passes expire one year from date of issue.
   7.1.8. The following needs to be included on the EAFB Form 5129A: Owner/User,
   organization, duty phone, vehicle make, model, year, color, license/state, pass/permit
   number, area of operation/location, justification, and effective period/dates.
   7.1.9. Vehicle Operator Qualifications. To operate a vehicle on the airfield with this pass, the
   operator must have a valid state or country’s driver’s license and complete airfield driver’s
   training.
7.1.10. Two types of vehicle passes are issued at Edwards AFB.
   7.1.11. Long-term passes (greater than 60 days) are documented on EAFB Forms 5436 and
   must be requested on the EAFB Form 5129 and 5129A.
   7.1.12. Temporary passes (60 days or less) are
7.2. Edwards AFB Form 5436 (Green) allows authorized contractor vehicles entry to the
airfield at any airfield gate authorized by AM. Vehicles must be registered to a company (not
individual). This pass is interchangeable among authorized and properly marked vehicles. Each
pass issued to the requesting organization must be controlled to ensure proper use. Vehicles will
display the pass in the front window when on the airfield. Marked government or military
vehicles do not require an Edwards AFB Airfield Pass.
   7.2.1. Vehicle Documentation. Project or contract manager will provide a copy of current
   registration and proof of insurance for each company vehicle requiring an airfield pass.
   7.2.2. Vehicle Markings. Contractor vehicles operating on the airfield must have the
   contractor’s name or company emblem in easily readable letters on each side of the vehicle.
   Magnetic placards lost on the flightline shall be reported to the Edwards AFB FOD Manager.
   NOTE: Magnetic company placards are not authorized within the CMA.
7.3. Edwards AFB Form 5436 (White, Yellow or Tan) allows POV entry to the airfield for
travel only to a specific parking area. Vehicles displaying the white, yellow, or tan EAFB
Form 5436 will use the most direct route of travel via marked roadways, as determined by the
Airfield Manager, to and from the respective parking area. This pass does not allow general
airfield driving or entry into restricted areas or CMA. Failure to follow route or parking area
restrictions may result in loss of parking privileges and confiscation of the parking pass. NOTE:
The pass color shall be changed annually or at the discretion of the AFM.
   7.3.1. Vehicle Markings. No special markings are needed to operate a vehicle using this
   pass. The pass must be displayed in the front window and visible at all times while on the
   airfield and in the designated parking area.
   7.3.2. Motorcyclists must have their pass on their person while operating on the airfield. It
   must be readily available if 412 SFS or Airfield Management requests it.
7.4. Edwards AFB Form 5436 (Blue) allows select privately owned and unmarked
government vehicles to operate on the airfield for official business. This pass does not allow
entry into restricted areas or authorize entry in the CMA without 412 OG/CC written
authorizations on file with 412 OSS/OSAM.

   7.4.1. Pass Approval. Send EAFB Form 5129 through the requesting unit commander to 412
   OG/CC for approval. The request must be justified to include type and frequency of use,
   explanation why government vehicle use is unacceptable, and identification of individuals
   (by job titles) authorized to use the pass. Upon approval, the requesting agency will hand
   carry the EAFB Form 5129 to 412 OSS/OSAM to obtain pass.
   7.4.2. Vehicle Markings. No special markings are needed to operate a vehicle using this
   pass. The pass must be displayed in the front window and visible at all times while on the
   airfield and in the designated parking area.
   7.4.3. Motorcyclists must have their pass on their person while operating on the airfield. It
   must be readily available if 412 SFS or Airfield Management requests it.
7.5. Edwards AFB Form 5292 (Red) allows entry to the airfield for operations briefed by
412 OSS/OSAM. The pass is issued by AM for short-term airfield vehicle operations by
contractors, military, DoD civilian, TDY rental vehicles, etc. AM will enter the area for which
the temporary pass is authorized (e.g., Area M.) and will overprint the pass with “Logo or No
Logo” as necessary and enter an expiration date. In the event multiple areas are required in the
performance of duties or contract, all area numbers will be placed on the card. The EAFB Form
5292 must be readily visible when operating on the airfield.
   7.5.1. Pass Issuance. Individuals requiring short-term airfield vehicle access must personally
   process through AM. Individuals requesting a temporary pass must present proper proof of
   permission to access the controlled area, current vehicle registration, proper proof of
   insurance, and a current Air Force Form 483. 412 OSS/OSAM will verify airfield travel
   requirements by official travel orders or responsible contracting agency. Questions
   concerning the requirement validity will be referred to the AFM or 412 OSS/CC.
   7.5.2. Expiration Date. The pass is good for the duration of required presence on the
   airfield, not to exceed 60 days.
   7.5.3. Special Exemptions. Delivery vehicles requiring temporary access to deliver materials
   (i.e., asphalt, steel, concrete, lumber, gravel, fuels, etc.) to airfield sites must have an
   authorized escort. The escort must have a valid AF Form 483, the proper security credentials
   for the area, and the escorted vehicle must have a valid EAFB Form 5292 issued.

                                           Chapter 9

                               RADIO COMMUNICATIONS

9.1. General. Radio communications are a critical link in the ATC system. Observe proper
radio discipline at all times. Ensure transmissions are brief, clearly spoken, and include only
information pertinent to the situation. When inside the CMA, operators will monitor all radio
communications. Repeat instructions received verbatim to validate the approval/disapproval
instructions. This is especially important concerning hold short instructions and clearances. Do
not proceed into the CMA prior to reading back instructions. VHF/UHF transmissions are
reserved for the primary use of aircraft and ATCT personnel.
9.2. Radio Techniques.
   9.2.1. Listen before transmitting. Make sure no one else is talking. If someone else is talking,
   keying another transmitter will be ineffective and will likely override or block out the
   receiver.
   9.2.2. Think about what you are going to request before keying the transmitter.
   9.2.3. Make your request short, precise and to the point. Speak in a conversational tone. It is
   advised to allow a slight pause between keying the microphone and speaking to ensure your
   first word is transmitted clearly.
   9.2.4. Wait for a response from tower before calling again. The controller may be looking
   for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or scanning the runway to
   enable your request.
   9.2.5. Be alert for sounds or lack of sounds on your receiver. Check volume, frequency, and
   ensure the microphone is not stuck in the transmit position. When the microphone is stuck in
   the transmit position, it is considered a “hot mic” and you may hear the tower or other
   individuals refer to it as such. If you have “hot mic”, your receiver is disabled and
   transmissions from ATCT are blocked.
   9.2.6. Be sure you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the tower.
   Refer to Attachment 5, Radio and Visual Blind Spot Map to ensure you are not in a radio
   blind spot. NOTE: Lakebed runways cannot be seen from the Alternate Tower.
9.3. Phraseology.
   9.3.1. Proper phraseology is key to ensure controllers understand you. The controller must
   know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their controller duties.
   Conversely, the vehicle operator must know exactly what the controller wants them to do.
   9.3.2. The words "clear,” “cleared,” or “clearance” shall not be used in communication with
   ATCT. Exception: Vehicle operators may reply ― “Loud and Clear” in response to an
   ATCT request for radio transmission quality or clarity.
   9.3.3. Vehicle operators must contact the tower controller each and every time they proceed
   onto or leave the CMA. When proceeding onto a CMA, vehicle operators must advise the
   controller of three things: WHO you are, WHERE you are at, and WHAT your intentions
 42                                              EDWARDSAFBI13-213 15 JANUARY 2014


   are. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications with the tower to
   ensure the ground controller knows that the message was received.
   9.3.4. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:

Table 9.1. Sample Runway Crossing Phraseology
 Vehicle Operator:              “Edwards Ground, Airfield One”
 ATCT:                          “Airfield One, Edwards Ground”
 Vehicle Operator:              “Edwards Ground, Airfield One request to cross Runway
                                22 Right at Taxiway Charlie”
 ATCT:                          “Airfield One, cross runway 22 Right at Taxiway Charlie”
                                OR
                                “Airfield One, Hold Short of Runway 22 Right”
   9.3.5. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time for
   correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or you do
   not understand the instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat it “Say Again”.

Table 9.2. Sample Read Back Instructions
 Vehicle Operator:              “Airfield One understands approved to cross Runway 22
                                Right at Taxiway Charlie”
                                OR
                                “Airfield One, Holding Short of runway 22 Right at
                                Taxiway Charlie”
 Vehicle Operator:              “Edwards Ground, Airfield One crossing complete, Runway
                                22 right at Taxiway Charlie”
 ATCT:                          “Airfield One, Roger”
   9.3.6. If the vehicle operators are issued hold short instructions, they are required to provide
   a read back to the ATCT.

Table 9.3. Sample Hold Short Instructions
ATCT:                          “Airfield One, proceed across Runway 22 Right at Taxiway
                               Charlie, Hold short of Runway 22 Left”
Vehicle Operator:              “Airfield One, Roger”
ATCT:                          “Airfield One, Read Back Hold Short Instructions”
Vehicle Operator:              “Airfield One, proceeding across Runway 22 Right at
                               Taxiway Charlie, will hold short of Runway 22 Left”
   9.3.7. Once vehicle is out of or off the CMA, vehicle operators must inform ATCT.
EDWARDSAFBI13-213 15 JANUARY 2014                                                                43


Table 9.4. Sample Crossing Complete Instructions
Vehicle Operator:             “Edwards Ground, Airfield One”
ATCT:                         “Airfield One, Edwards Ground”
Vehicle Operator:             “Airfield One, crossing complete Runway 22 Left at
                              Taxiway Charlie”
ATCT:                         “Airfield One, Roger”

   9.3.8. Uncontrolled Airfield Phraseology. When the airfield is closed, vehicle operators
   must make their calls “in the blind”. When a vehicle operator makes a call in the blind, there
   will be no response from a controlling agency. The call is made for the benefit and
   understanding of other users on the airfield.
      9.3.8.1. Phraseology:
          9.3.8.1.1. Call Sign.
          9.3.8.1.2. What you are doing (crossing Runway 22R).
          9.3.8.1.3. Position ( at taxiway Charlie, barrier shack, distance remaining marker,
          etc.).
          9.3.8.1.4. Statement that the transmission is in the blind

Table 9.5. Sample “in the blind” runway crossing phraseology
 Vehicle Operator:                “Airfield One is crossing Runway 22 Right at Taxiway
                                  Charlie in the blind”
 Vehicle Operator:                “Airfield one is off Runway 22 Right at Taxiway Charlie in
                                  the blind”

                                  comply with it.
9.5. Phonetic Aviation Alphabet. Because some letters have similar sounds, e.g., B and P, the
international aviation community uses the following words to reduce confusion. For example,
Taxiway B would be referred to as Taxiway Bravo on the radio. Airfield drivers must know and
use the following phonetic alphabet. NOTE: Parallel runways are marked with an L, C, or R
(Left, Center or Right) after the numerical designation. When vehicle operators see signs that
indicate Runway 22R, it is pronounced as Runway TOO -TOO RIGHT (as opposed to Romeo).

9.6. ATCT Light Gun Signals. Air traffic controllers use a light gun as a backup system for
communicating with aircraft or ground vehicles if their radios stop working. When a vehicle
operator experiences a radio failure on a runway or taxiway, they must vacate the runway as
quickly and safely as possible and contact the ATCT or AM by other means, such as a cellular
telephone to advise of the situation. If this is not practical, then the driver, after vacating the
runway, should turn the vehicle toward the tower and start flashing the vehicle headlights and
wait for the controller to signal with the light gun. All vehicle operators are required to know and
comply with the following signals:
   9.6.1. Steady Green Light: “Cleared to Cross”, “Proceed”, “Go”.
   9.6.2. Steady Red Light: “STOP! Vehicle will not be moved”.
   9.6.3. Flashing Red Light: “Clear active taxiway/runway”.
   9.6.4. Flashing White Light: “Return to starting point”.
   9.6.5. Red and Green Light: “General warning. Exercise extreme caution.”

Terms
Airfield— A general term encompassing the runways, taxiways, aircraft parking ramps, access,
service, and perimeter roads, hangars, and all open areas immediately adjacent to the runways,
taxiways, and aircraft parking ramps.
Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI)— Formerly known as the flightline driving instruction. It
establishes local operations, procedures and training standards for driving a vehicle on the
airfield. It is also called ADI.
Airfield Driving Program Manager (ADPM)— The civilian or military individual selected by
the squadron/unit commander to administer the organization’s vehicle program, to include
operation of vehicles on the airfield and associated training.
Airfield Management (AM)— A function that conducts airfield inspections and checks for
safety and compliance with the planning and design criteria. Plans, organizes and directs airfield
activities to include airfield construction/repairs, airfield driving program, ice/snow removal
operations, bird/wildlife control, etc. Procures, maintains, and produces information on safe
operation of aircraft through the national and international airspace system such as Flight
Information Publications, aeronautical charts and maps, Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), local
airfield and navigational aid status, and weather information. Process domestic and international
flight plans.
Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS)— A facility located near the airfield that provides
