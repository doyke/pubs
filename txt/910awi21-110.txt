     2.5. Notify the Traffic Management Office (TMO) Section supervisor that engine shipment
     is required (air or surface) and provide shipping documentation (DD1149) for transportation
     processing. For air shipment, coordinate with TMO Section on preparation of the Shipper’s
     Declaration of Dangerous Goods.
     2.6. Report to Comprehensive Engine Management System (CEMS), shipment transaction,
     and the date/time engine was accepted by the TMO Section as recorded on the DD1149.
     2.7. Provide the Equipment Management Section a copy of the shipping document
     (DD1149) to process engine stand/trailer (adjust equipment level) for shipment/receipt
     actions.
     2.8. Provide support personnel to assist in positioning and loading of engine, as workload
     permits.
     2.9. Upon receipt of engine from TMO Section, check Station Record Account Number for
     correct “ship to” (FJ6656), ensure proper engine and Quick Engine Change (QEC)
     configuration, complete external damage assessment (including stand/trailer), process receipt
     transaction in the CEMS database.
     2.10. Perform annual Engine Management training to personnel who will report engine
     status or are responsible for engine documentation and scheduling using Computer Based
     Training (CBT) Training Course at https://cews.tinker.af.mil/cbt/cbt.htm
     2.11. Ensure that all personnel within Propulsion Branch report engine, module, prop, and
     component actions to Engine Management no later than the close of business of the next
     business day after the transaction occurs. (Note: all CEMS transactions will be accomplished
     as soon as possible.)
3. TMO Responsibilities (Engine Shipments and Receipts):
     3.1. Receives notification and required copy of the shipping document (DD1149) from the
     Unit Engine Manager or alternate 910th Propulsion (MXMP) personnel. Confirms shipping
     method (air or surface) and required delivery date.
     3.2. Weigh and mark engine as required for air/surface shipment. Inspect engine and trailer
     for proper preparation and packaging. For air shipment, ensures Shipper’s Declaration of
     Dangerous Goods is prepared and signed by a qualified individual authorized by the
     Squadron Commander.
     3.3. Accepts engine for shipment (air or surface), generates cargo manifest and load plans as
     applicable IAW aircraft directives, and transports and loads engines for required shipment
     (air or surface).
     3.4. Orders air-ride equipped vehicle for surface movement of engine (72-hour movement
     required for 2LM engine input). Provide and install required shoring/blocking for engine
     shipping security.

   Order (AFTO) Form 349 will be used for MIS (G0-81) to reflect engine status changes.
   4.5. Cannibalization of engine components will be directed by the Cannibalization Authority
   (Production Superintendent) and will be coordinated between Maintenance Operational
   Control (MOC), Maintenance Supply Liaison (MSL), Propulsion Flight Chief or Shop
   Supervisor, and Unit Engine Manager. MOC will issue a Job Control Number (JCN) and
   input into G081, MSL will transfer the original Supply Document Number to the
   Cannibalization JCN.
