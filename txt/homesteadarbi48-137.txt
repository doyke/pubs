                     FILTERING FACE PIECE DEVICES & TRAINING

A2.1. Filtering face piece devices (FFPD) are not considered by the US Air Force to be
respiratory protection for purposes of AFOSHSTD 48-137, Respiratory Protection Program.
These devices may be worn strictly for comfort purposes if an Air Force employee desires to
wear them.
     A2.1.1. Filtering face piece device users must be trained by their supervisor initially and
     annually on the limitations of these devices.
A2.2. FFPD Limitations:
     A2.2.1. FFPDs shall be NIOSH (National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health)
     approved N95 FFPDs for protection against dusts and mists ONLY. That is, they remove
     some particles, but not gases and vapors.
     A2.2.2. FFPDs will NOT remove carbon monoxide, solvents, paint vapor, cleaning solutions
     vapor, fuel vapors, alcohol vapors and acids.
     A2.2.3. FFPDs may remove wood dust, cement dust, dirt (from sweeping or work that kicks
     up the soil), mists and fiberglass. This will only happen IF you are able to maintain a good
     face-to-face piece seal.
A2.3. FFPDs are NEVER to be worn during tasks for which respiratory protection is required,
as specified by the Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight.
A2.4. FFPDs are NEVER to be used in atmospheres that could be immediately dangerous to life
and health (IDLH).
A2.5. FFPDs are NEVER to be used in atmospheres containing less than 19. 5 percent oxygen.
A2.6. Follow the manufacturer’s instruction for replacing FFPDs. In general, if you detect
breathing resistance (i.e., it becomes more difficult to breathe through the FFPD, you must
replace the FFPD.)
A2.7. Procedures for Donning FFPD:
     A2.7.1. Inspect the FFPD prior to each use. Check the elasticity and tightness of headbands,
     fasteners and adjusters. Check exhalation valves (if FFPD has them) for cracks, tears, dirt, or
     build-up of material between valve and valve seat. Check the filter material for tears or
     cracks.
     A2.7.2. Fit face piece on nose-bridge making sure that you are able to breathe through nose.
     Then swing bottom of face piece into contact with the chin. Position headbands with one
     strap above the ears and over the crown of the head, and the other strap below the ears,
     around the nape of the neck. Adjust for comfortable fit by lengthening or shortening straps.
     Adjust the straps just snug enough so that no air leaks around the face piece. The nose piece
     should be molded into your face by using the two hand method. Pinching the bridge over
     your nose with one hand often results in uneven pressure and a poor seal.
     A2.7.3. Hair (stubble, mustache, sideburns, and beard) which passes between the face and
     the sealing surface of the FFPD will interfere with the seal and will reduce the FFPD
HOMESTEADARBI48-137 17 DECEMBER 2012                                                             9


   effectiveness. A head covering which passes between the sealing surface of an FFPD and the
   wearer's face (stocking cap, ball cap) will reduce the effectiveness of the FFPD.
A2.8. Cleaning and Storage.
   A2.8.1. Cleaning and sanitizing FFPDs is not necessary. At the end of the shift or when the
   FFPD is dirty or breathing resistance has increased, the FFPD should be discarded.
   A2.8.2. FFPDs shall be stored to protect against dust, sunlight, heat, extreme cold, excessive
   moisture and chemicals. FFPDs shall not be stored in chemical storage cabinets, lockers,
   rooms or areas.
A2.9. If you suspect you or your co-workers may be overexposed to a particular chemical (for
instance, if you are experiencing physical symptoms), you must contact 482 MSG/SGPB at
extension 415-7603 so air sampling can be performed and chemical exposure levels determined.
In addition, if you are experiencing a suspected occupational illness, it must be reported to BE at
extension 415-7603 and investigated.
