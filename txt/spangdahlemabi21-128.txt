SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision incorporates
specific responsibilities to improve accountability and issuing of LOX and LIN carts.
1. 52d Logistics Readiness Squadron (52 LRS), Fuels Management Flight, Cryogenics Section will:
   1.1. Store serviceable LOX and LIN carts in the servicing area of building 205/655 (airlift) when
   facility is operational, hereafter referred to as “cryogenic storage.”
   1.2. Fill LOX and LIN carts in adherence to Air Force Instruction (AFI) 23-201, Fuels Management,
   and Technical Order (TO) 42B6-1-1, Quality Control Aviators Breathing Oxygen And Aviators
   Gaseous Breathing Oxygen.
   1.3. Establish and maintain a “ready line” for serviceable LOX and LIN servicing carts.
   1.4. Establish and maintain a “hold line” for LOX and LIN servicing carts. Carts will be placed on
   the hold line for the following conditions:
2                                                          SPANGDAHLEMABI21-128 3 March 2009
       1.4.1. When a cart is returned to cryogenic storage unserviceable, cryogenic personnel discover
       discrepancies during cart filling, or discrepancies that cannot be corrected “on the spot” that are
       discovered on Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 244, Industrial/Support Equipment
       Record or AFTO Form 134, Aviators Breathing Oxygen Servicing Trailer Log
       (Liquid/Gaseous). NOTE: Report all unserviceable LOX/LIN servicing carts to the 52d
       Component Maintenance Squadron CMS Production Superintendent.
       1.4.2. When 52 CMS, Electrical-Environmental (E&E) Section (52CMS/MXMCA) personnel
       request LOX or LIN carts to be placed on hold line to support deployments or exercises. NOTE:
       52 CMS/MXMCA will hereafter be referred to as E&E.
       1.4.3. When 52d Equipment Maintenance Squadron (52 EMS), Aerospace Ground Equipment
       (AGE) Section (52 EMS/MXMG) or 52 CMS/E&E personnel request LOX or LIN carts to be
       placed on hold line for scheduled or unscheduled maintenance. NOTE: 52 EMS/MXMG will
       hereafter be referred to as AGE.
       1.4.4. LOX cart “low use trailer” servicing information is located in TO 42B6-1-1 and defined
       as a trailer used to service aircraft on less than 5 of the past 12 calendar days. When to fill a low
       use trailer- a low use trailer shall be filled before servicing aircraft if it was not filled during the
       past two calendar days. When to drain and fill a low use trailer- a low use trailer shall be
       drained and filled before servicing aircraft if it was not drained during the past 12 calendar days.
       Exception: If a trailer has been filled with 45 gallons or more on one of the 12 days, it may be
       considered drained and filled.
       1.4.5. When a trailer is identified as low use and cannot be filled IAW T.O. 42B6-1-1, the
       AFTO Form 244 will be annotated with a Red X and 52 CMS will be notified by the Fuels
       Resource Control Center (RCC). Low-use carts will be drained by 52 CMS prior to filling the
       cart with new product. NOTE: AFI 23-201, paragraph 6.10.6, requires written procedures to
       identify, report and limit low use LOX carts. In T.O. 42B6-1-1, paragraph 3-25b, it is advisable
       to keep trailers containing liquid oxygen to a minimum. Those trailers not required for current
       levels of operation will be maintained in standby status.
    1.5. Cryogenic servicing times are 0730 and 1900 hours for building 205 to cover day and night
    flying operations. Weekends and holidays are 1000 hours. During exercises servicing times will be
    flexible. When servicing changes to one time per day a schedule will be worked out between AMXS
    and AMS.
       1.5.1. A two-person safety policy will be observed during all LOX and LIN servicing. This
       two-person team will consist of one Fuels Specialist, AFSC 2F0X1, and one safety person
       designated to assist in positioning equipment and performing safety person duty. Due to the 52
       FW aircraft receiving the “On Board Oxygen Generation System”, which will result in a reduced
       need for cryogenic servicing, workload permitting the 52d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (52
       AMXS) and the 726 AMS will provide a safety person at the servicing time if their assigned
       assets require servicing. If an organization cannot supply a safety person, they must notify 52
       LRS to prevent wasted manpower and their assets will not be serviced.
       1.5.2. Fuels Management Flight will provide all Personnel Protective Equipment (PPE) required
       during cart filling operations and direct use as required by applicable AFIs, TOs and
       Occupational Safety & Health standards.
       1.5.3. Emergency servicing is classified as servicing required outside normal servicing hours
       and must be justified by an actual aircraft emergency or when required by the 726 AMS to fulfill
       a real-world mission after exhausting all alternative routes. The 726 AMS will be given priority
       for „loaner‟ LOX carts to prevent mission delays. Proper management, coordination and
SPANGDAHLEMABI21-128 3 March 2009                                                                     3


      preplanning are a must; however emergency filling will be accomplished using the following
      guidelines: Emergency fills should be kept to an absolute minimum. All emergency fill
      requests will initially come through the Maintenance Operation Center (MOC) to the RCC at
      452-2416 and provide the following information: cart number requiring service, tail numbers of
      aircraft requiring cryogenic product, take off times of aircraft requiring cryogenic product, and
      estimated time of arrival of carts at the cryogenic section.
      1.5.4. Flight Superintendent or acting Shift Super (Production Superintendent) of the
      organization in need of the emergency fill will contact RCC (452-2416) to verify request, in turn
      RCC will contact Fuels Management for approval.
      1.5.5. Continuous unscheduled servicing outside of the servicing hours listed herein will be
      recorded by the Cryogenics Servicing Supervisor in the RCC pass on log and reported to each
      organization involved for resolution.
      1.5.6. The requesting AMU or AMS is responsible to provide a safety person for all
      emergency servicing. When maintenance personnel are required, they will remain with the
      carts during filling to act as the safety observer under the two-person policy required for
      cryogenic servicing operations. Fuels Management Flight will provide a specific briefing
      regarding safety observer‟s responsibilities during a mishap (IAW AFI 23 -201, para. 1.9.1) and
      all required PPE. Appropriate PPE will be worn and all safety procedures in the servicing
      checklist will be followed.
      1.5.7. Exceptions to servicing hours will be made under the following circumstances:
          1.5.7.1. During contingencies, carts will be serviced without regard to normal servicing
          hours. Coordination with RCC is required. When the cart‟s in-commission rate falls below
          50%, special servicing hours may be established upon request. This exception will apply only
          to carts of the same product (e.g., if the LOX cart in-commission rate falls below 50%, LOX
          carts will be serviced and LIN carts will still be filled during normal servicing hours).
   1.6. Resolve discrepancies with users when incorrect documentation is discovered on AFTO Form
   134 preventing LOX servicing carts from being filled IAW AFI 23-201.
   1.7. Notify E&E section when LOX and LIN carts are placed on the hold line (see paragraph 1.4.).
2. 52 CMS/E&E Section will:
   2.1. Provide daily status of all LOX and LIN servicing carts to 52 CMS Production
   Superintendent,52 CMS Maintenance Superintendent, 52 CMS Accessories Flight Chief, 52 LRS,
   Fuels Management Cryogenics Section Supervisor, 52 EMS Production Superintendent, AGE Flight,
   all AMUs and AMC Production Superintendent.
   2.2. Assign and distribute cryogenic carts between all AMUs based on assigned aircraft. E&E still
   maintains ownership of carts; distribution to AMUs establishes more direct control for cart
   availability to support aircraft servicing operations.
   2.3. Coordinate with cryogenic storage to place LOX and LIN servicing carts on hold line to support
   deployments, exercises, or scheduled/unscheduled maintenance (see paragraphs 1.4.2. and 1.4.3.).
   2.4. Coordinate with AGE flight to conduct scheduled/unscheduled maintenance on LOX and LIN
   servicing carts (see paragraph 1.4.3.).

     3.1. Review the AFTO Form 244 prior to moving the cart. If cart contains an open Red X condition,
     take it to the affected agency as applicable for completion. If the AFTO Form 244 is missing, leave
     the cart where it is, and notify 52 EMS Production Superintendent. The Production Superintendent
     will notify the affected agency where the cart is located, and this agency is responsible for initiating
     a Combat Air Force (CAF) Form 145, Lost Tool/Object Report.
     3.2. Perform a walk around inspection and visually check tires and general condition on all LOX
     and LIN servicing carts prior to transport. If damage is found, immediately notify Quality
     Assurance, 52 EMS Production Superintendent, and the 52 CMS Production Superintendent.
     3.3. Transport LOX and LIN servicing carts to servicing and maintenance facilities.
     3.4. Document all LOX and LIN servicing cart pickups and drop-offs on AF Form 864, Daily
     Requirement and Dispatch Record.

     on LOX servicing carts to determine cart serviceability prior to use.
     6.2. Perform a walk-around inspection and visually check tires, gauges, general condition, and
     product level prior to use.
     6.3. Ensure all LIN servicing carts are used only to service F-16 emergency power unit (EPU). Use
     of the LIN carts on any other system other than the EPU could be result in failure of the aircraft
     emergency system. All LIN carts are identified by stenciled letters on front and back of cart stating
     “EPU USE ONLY.”
     6.4. AMUs are responsible to coordinate the “borrowing” of LOX and LIN servicing carts with
     remaining AMUs when their assigned carts are deployed or unserviceable due to
     scheduled/unscheduled maintenance.
SPANGDAHLEMABI21-128 3 March 2009                                                                    5
