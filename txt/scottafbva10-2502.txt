                                EARTHQUAKE SAFETY RULES
                                         BEFORE AN EARTHQUAKE

    1. Check for hazards in the home (i.e., refrigerators, water heaters, book shelves, glass, or any item that can
       fall and/or cause injury. Place heavy items on lower shelves.
    2. Do not mount heavy items above couches or beds.
    3. Identify the location of main utility shutoff valves and become familiar with their operations.
    4. Identify safe places in each room for protection.
        Voids or open areas are found in collapsed buildings beside heavy furniture, bathtubs, cars, etc.
        The smaller the room, the sturdier it is likely to be. Try to avoid outside walls and windows.
   5. Disaster Supplies. Prepare for several days without outside help and for damage to phone, electricity,
      water, and natural gas lines.
        First-aid kit                                         Flashlights
        Nonperishable foods and bottled water                 Battery-operated radio
        Other items such as camping supplies                  Spare batteries

                                         DURING AN EARTHQUAKE

    1.   Take cover immediately.
    2.   Avoid standing in doorways. Most injuries occur while entering or exiting buildings.
    3.   If outside, move to an open area, away from trees, power lines, etc.
    4.   When driving, stop quickly in an open area and stay in your car. Watch for downed power lines.

                                          AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE

    1. Prepare for aftershocks. These aftershocks are normally less intense as time goes on; however, they can
       occur months after the initial earthquake.
    2. Do not reenter damaged buildings. Aftershocks can weaken buildings, causing them to collapse.
         Masonry buildings are more susceptible to damage during earthquakes.
         Wood or steel buildings are more stable during earthquakes.
    3. Turn off gas and electricity if possible. Fires are common after earthquakes.
    4. Check for and treat injuries.
    5. Monitor local radio stations for emergency information.
    6. Do not drive over bridges and overpasses until authorized to do by local safety/law enforcement
       personnel.
