   complaint, clinic/department or individual involved with the complaint, and any other
   information pertinent to the case.
   3.3. Reporting Methods.
      3.3.1. If the patient reports in person with his/her concern:
          3.3.1.1. Patient advocates should address the patient’s concerns in a private area, free
          from distraction, but readily accessible for staff intervention, if a situation should
          arise where safety is compromised.
              3.3.1.1.1. Staff and patient safety are major concerns.
              3.3.1.1.2. If a staff member feels the situation or patient presents a threat to
              anyone, the advocate should activate their panic button (where applicable) or call
              the Hospital Automated Resource Protection System at 292-6070.
          3.3.1.2. Have the patient put their complaint/concern in writing, or write the
          information for the patient and have the patient sign it, upon verification of the
          written information.
          3.3.1.3. Clinic/Section Patient Advocates should investigate all problems thoroughly
          before arriving at solutions, or referring the patient’s concern to the Wing Patient
          Advocate. Appropriate resolutions should result in the patient receiving optimum
          care and a follow-up to ensure satisfactory services have been rendered. Moreover,
          resolutions should include any facility process requiring changes to mitigate future
          complaints (where applicable).
 6                                                                   59MDWI41-115 26 July 2013


            3.3.1.4. These concerns must be handled within 5 duty days. All resolutions must be
            within the boundaries of current directives and policies governing the 59 MDW.
            Promises should not be made that are illegal, outside the realm of the Patient
            Advocate’s authority, or simply unachievable.
            3.3.1.5. If unable to resolve the complaint at the clinic or section level, Patient
            Advocates will elevate the concern through their chain of command. If the findings
            indicate a mistake was made, rectify the situation within the clinic or section.
            Concerns that cannot be resolved at this level should be forwarded to the Wing
            Patient Advocate. If the patient is there in person, either request the Wing Patient
            Advocate to come to your clinic or walk the patient to their office.
        3.3.2. If the patient files a complaint via the web page:
            3.3.2.1. A copy of the complaint is automatically emailed to the Wing Patient
            Advocate Program Manager.
            3.3.2.2. These complaints should be acknowledged within 1 duty day and resolved
            within 5 duty days.
            3.3.2.3. Copies of these complaints should be logged and maintained like all other
            patient concerns.
        3.3.3. If the patient fills out a request via ICE or comment card:
            3.3.3.1. A response is not required when a patient completes a 59 MDW Comment
            Card, unless the respondent specifically asks for a reply.
            3.3.3.2. Each comment and/or concern must be addressed with the parties involved.
            As a result, actions should be taken to prevent negative occurrences in the future.
                3.3.3.3.1. These complaints should be acknowledged within 1 duty day and
                resolved within 5 duty days.
                3.3.3.3.2. Feedback and other information should be readily available, if needed,
                and reported to the Wing Patient Advocate.
                3.3.3.3.3. Each clinic has the ability to view their statistics via ICE.
