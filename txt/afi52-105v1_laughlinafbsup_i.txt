1. Purpose. This instruction provides detailed guidance to assist Chaplain Service personnel
effectively resource and secure materials and services needed to meet chapel program direct and
indirect mission requirements. The expeditionary nature of Air Force operations requires an
objective approach by Chaplain Service personnel to adequately resource validated needs and
manage Base Operating Support (BOS) resources.
2. Global Ministry Resourcing Categories. Chaplain Service religious and spiritual support
programs are founded on the pillars of the Air Force Chaplain Service program: Ministry,
People, Resources, and Communications. These four components provide a resource allocation
framework directly tied to the AF/HC Strategic Plan upon which the program baseline is
established. The Chaplain Service supports efforts by chapel staffs to provide Air Force
communities properly resourced chapel programs. Chaplain Service financial plans should be
developed to meet well documented, coordinated requirements identified via a robust and
methodical needs assessment process. Chapel program effectiveness evaluations should be
based on how well they implement the goals and objectives in the Chaplain Service Strategic
Plan.
   2.1. Ministry: This pillar supports initiatives designed to improve the ability of Chaplain
   Service personnel to respond to the spiritual needs of Air Force members and their families
   across the full spectrum of air and space operations, while providing for their diverse
   religious requirements and changing demographics.
   2.2. People: This pillar supports initiatives designed to recruit, develop, and sustain
   Chaplain Service personnel and contract personnel who are committed to the spiritual care of
   tomorrow’s Air Force.
   2.3. Resourcing: This pillar supports initiatives designed to provide the structure and
   resources needed to realize the Chaplain Service vision.
   2.4. Communications:    This pillar supports initiatives designed to enhance the
   communication between and among all levels/echelons of the Chaplain Service.
3. Planning and Programming. The Chaplain Service Planning, Programming, Budget and
Execution (PPBE) process planning occurs at all echelons. This process requires a long-range
approach, because it usually takes several years to acquire the resources necessary to conduct a
world-class operation, especially if those resources are high cost, military construction
(MILCON). Chaplain Service personnel at all echelons should coordinate their financial and
functional manager activities in order to be able to provide timely feedback regarding the status
of programming efforts (See Atch 1).
   3.1. Base/Installation Level Chaplain Service Program Planning. Wing Chaplains will
   develop and implement operating instructions that outline policies, processes, and procedures
   for resourcing the wing chapel program.
       3.1.1. They will develop validated, comprehensive, detailed, and objective fiscal
       programs, budgets, and financial plans that establish defensible requirements developed
       via the Global Ministry life cycle process (See para. 5).
       3.1.2. Chapel staffs will provide higher headquarters (HHQ) information copies of their
       financial plans, even as they develop and forward those plans through financial
       management channels. This enables these headquarters to be functional advocates for
 4                                        AFI52-105V1_LAUGHLINAFBSUP_I 2 JUNE 2010


        validated subordinate unit chapel program initiatives. Such visibility, across subordinate
        units, would enhance the headquarters’ ability to aggregate chapel program requirements
        into MAJCOM program objective memoranda (POMs).
     3.2. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Chaplain Service Program Planning.                      Chaplain Service
     personnel, at the this level develop their own financial plans as well as document, integrate,
     determine, control, and act as chapel program advocates. They interact with HHQ financial
     managers to make a case for valid chapel program initiatives as these managers construct the
     HHQ POMs. These POMs reflect a summation of base-level financial plan projections.
        3.2.1. From a functional manager perspective, MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Chaplain staffs will
        provide AF/HC with information copies of MAJCOM/FOA/DRU chapel program
        financial plans to enable AF/HC to be better able to advocate for adequate funding of
        Chaplain Service programs under review by the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS).
     3.3. Air Staff Chaplain Service Program Planning: Armed with MAJCOM/FOA/DRU
     chapel program financial plans, AF/HC planners gain insights about the most pressing needs
     across the Chaplain Service, and as appropriate, act as advocates before the AFCS for
     programs with Air Force-wide impact.
        3.3.1. Additionally, AF/HC develops the Chaplain Service Strategic Fund program,
        which is designed to meet strategic requirements for sustaining a comprehensive religious
        program (Reference Program Element Code (PEC) 91229F, Chaplain Service Strategic
        Fund Program Development/Execution Plan).
4. Categories of Requirements. There are two categories of requirements that vie for Chaplain
Service resources (see Table 1). They are: Direct Mission Requirements and Indirect Mission
Requirements. Chapel staffs must pay close attention to the differences between these types of
requirements and the applicable laws, DoD Directives and Instruction, and other regulations as
they develop and execute their fiscal plans. These differences determine the kinds of funds used
to meet chapel program requirements. Chaplain Service personnel must capture the actual and
expected costs to meet both types of requirements.
     4.1. Direct Mission Requirements. The Air Force requires the Chaplain Service to organize,
     train, and equip Chaplain Service personnel to meet the spiritual and religious needs of the
     Air Force community. The Chaplain Service meets these needs by conducting religious
     observances, providing pastoral care, modeling ethical leadership, and advising unit
     leadership. Those activities that directly support the unit mission are called Direct Mission
     Requirements and are financed with appropriated funds (see Table 1).
     4.1.1.    Manpower: Chapel staffs will follow established manpower requirements
     determination processes to ensure they have properly identified the minimum manpower
     levels needed to successfully accomplish assigned missions. (See AFD 38-2, Manpower and
     AFI 38-201, Determining Manpower requirements and AFI 38-204, Programming USAF
     Manpower)

Note: "In the absence of appropriated funds availability, Chapel Tithes and Offerings Fund (CTOF)
may be used to fund direct mission requirements." See AFI 52-105, Vol II for guidance on CTOF
allocation requirements.
          4.1.2. Facilities: The Chaplain Service requires adequately sized, designed, and properly
          maintained religious facilities in their support of the free exercise of religion. These
          religious facilities must accommodate the religious needs of the entire base community.
          Wing Chaplains and their staffs must ensure the sanctity of sacred space within such
          facilities.
              4.1.2.1. Construction and Modification: HQ USAF/HCP and MAJCOM/ FOA/DRU
              HCs, should assist Wing Chaplains as they advise commanders on the need for and
              construction of new facilities coded for religious use.
                  4.1.2.1.1. Wing Chaplains will work in close coordination with Base Civil
                  Engineers and their Facility Working Groups to ensure religious facilities meet
                  required standards. The USAF or MAJCOM Chapel Facilities Design Guides
                  provide guidelines for evaluating, developing, and submitting facility construction
                  and modification requests.

           4.1.2.1.3.3. (Added-LAUGHLINAFB) The day after the event, another
           walkthrough will be performed with the requestor to ensure that guidelines
           and responsibilities were met.
    4.1.2.2. Naming and Designation: Follow established Air Force procedures when
    naming or designating religious facilities (See AFI 36-3108, Memorialization
    Program and Ceremonies).
    4.1.2.3. Secular Activities: Religious facilities will be used to support secular

5. Resourcing Global Ministry. There are five phases in the resourcing Global Ministry life
cycle. These phases are: (1) conducting local needs assessment, (2) ministry/program planning,
(3) resourcing the ministry/ program plan, (4) ministry/program execution, and (5) program
evaluation. They form the basis for developing fiscal programs that meet unit spiritual health
and religious needs. They provide chapel staff a standardized process for gathering data needed
to prepare strong narrative justifications for chapel program requirements as well as impact
analyses, if requirements are not funded.
     5.1. Needs Assessment Phase: Since it establishes the basis for prioritized chapel program
     requirements, it is critical this first phase in the Global Ministry resourcing process be done
     thoroughly. These requirements are determined by using the “Doing Global Ministry” guide
     to comprehensively research local needs. The needs assessment process focuses on
     identifying, validating, and prioritizing ministry or chapel program) requirements (See
     Attachment 2). As a result, needs assessments provide the basis for advocating for resources
     and defending chapel program fiscal plans.
        5.1.1. Needs assessments should be validated annually.
     5.2. Chapel Program Planning Phase: This is the second phase in the cycle. During this
     phase, all chapel programs and ministry needs must be reviewed and the associated people,
     ministry/program, materiel, and communications costs identified (See Attachment 3). The
     chapel program plan cost reflects a compilation of all the costs associated with religious
     observances, counseling, training, pastoral visitation, etc.
     5.3. Resourcing Phase: During this third phase, chapel staffs determine whether or not
     identified requirements will be resourced as direct or indirect mission requirements (See
     Attachment 4). Appropriated funds will be the only source for financing direct mission
     requirements.
     5.4. Ministry/Program Execution Phase: During this phase, chapel staffs expend monies
     against funded requirements based on budgets derived from their financial plans. These
     budgets should serve as guides for expensing or consuming resources across the fiscal year.
     Obligations should be in keeping with quarterly, semi-annual, and annual goals.
     5.5. Program Evaluation Phase: This is the longest lasting phase since it continuously
     monitors implementation and results of chapel programs in order to permit adjustment of
     near-, mid-, and log-term plans (See Attachment 5). Chapel staffs will monitor AF Forms
     1270 and 1270A as well as appropriate local resource management data gathering devices to
     measure effectiveness and establish baselines for subsequent fiscal years, as necessary.

The figure above shows the interconnectedness between the financial management processes and
the functional management coordination processes. In order to facilitate centralized Chaplain
Service planning and programming and decentralized execution, Chaplain Service personnel
must develop strong coordination relationships at base level and higher echelons between
functional and financial managers. By sharing financial planning information along the
functional management chain, Chaplain Service personnel allow the AF/HC to enhance their
ability to plan strategically for the entire Chaplain Service. Other functional areas use these
relationships to effective present their funded and unfunded requirements.

                               Needs Assessment Data Sheet
The sample Needs Assessment Data Sheet above shows a listing of local community needs at
Anyplace AFB. (It is by no means a complete listing of base needs.) It is developed from
scratch, but reflects needs identified through ongoing unit visitations, experience with families
and singles, and interaction with community clergy, for example. It does not address the
resourcing actions required to obtain required supplies and materials, for those see Atch 3. The
classification of ministry needs as High, Medium, or Low is a judgment call by the Wing
Chaplain in collaboration with his or her staff.

                            Program Plan Resourcing Sheet
The sample Program Plan Resourcing Sheet above shows the type and amount of funds (direct or
indirect mission support) that would be used for each ministry program. Appropriated funds
would be used to support direct mission requirements and nonappropriated funds for indirect
mission requirements. The Comprehensive Chapel Fund program could act as the source
document for the required data, since it reflects a compilation of budgeting activity in both the
appropriated and Nonappropriated fund arenas.

                                                 Doing Global Ministry Evaluation Sheet
The sample Doing Global Ministry Evaluation Sheet above can be used to help chapel staffs evaluate whether of not they have
effectively addressed community needs. Staffs need to compare customer surveys, ongoing needs assessments, and actual/planned
expenditures in order to evaluate ongoing programs.
Review customer satisfaction trends, to see whether they are going up, down, or staying steady. Also, examine annual costs over time,
for example, 2-3 years to see if the program’s spending too little, too much and if it its impacting customer satisfaction. Such reviews
should assist in developing future spending plans or initiatives.
