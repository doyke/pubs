____________________________________________________________________________________________________

This instruction implements AFPD 36-22, Military Training. It prescribes the joint policies and responsibilities of the US Air
Force (USAF), US Army (USA), US Navy (USN), and US Marine Corps (USMC) joint service air combat training (ACT).
This instruction authorizes joint service ACT and reflects the appropriate coordination of each service. It applies to all
USAF, USA, USN, and USMC units participating in joint service ACT.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication aligns the instruction with AFPD 36-22.

1. Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT) Programs. DACT programs provide a realistic application of fighter versus
fighter tactics and serve to develop a high level of tactical skill for all combat aircrews in countering a real world threat. The
use of dissimilar aircraft in the program furthers the learning process.

2. Training Objectives. To:

2.1. Encourage DACT between USAF, USA, USN, and USMC units.

2.2. Conduct joint training in as realistic an environment as possible, but not at the expense of safety.

3. Training Policy:

3.1. Conduct the DACT program according to the criteria agreed to by the USAF major commanders (MAJCOM), USA
major commanders (MACOM), USN type commanders (TYCOM), and USMC Fleet Marine Force (FMF) commanders of
the participating units (attachment 2).

3.2 Conduct all flights according to USAF, USA, USN, and USMC directives, instructions, and orders. When a conflict
exists the more restrictive rule will apply.

3.3 Stress safety throughout the program.

NOTE: For the purpose of this instruction, USMC FMF commanders include Commanding General, Fourth Marine Aircraft
Wing, Marine Reserve Force.

A2.4.3. Aircraft maneuvering limitations.

A2.4.4. Training Rules (TR)/Rules of Engagement (ROE).

A2.4.5. Disengagement criteria and procedures.

A2.4.6. Parameters for simulated weapon employment.

A2.4.7. Specific safety guidelines.

A2.5. TR: TR must include the following, as a minimum:

A2.5.1. Weather criteria.

A2.5.2. Initial attack scenarios.

A2.5.3. Minimum operating airspeeds or maximum AOA.

A2.5.4. Minimum operating altitudes.

A2.5.5. Safe separation responsibilities and procedures.

A2.5.6. Disengagement requirements and procedures.
