                                             Chapter 2

                        HIGHER HEADQUARTERS PLAN FORMATS

Section 2A—Overview

2.1. General. The Department of Defense (DOD) uses many different types of plans listed in
AFI 10-401, Section 3C. To assist with understanding of plans it is necessary to provide
definitions of DOD Plans. The European Command (EUCOM) has provided the guidance
that Functional Plans (FUNCPLAN) are no longer used within the DOD; and only
recognizes the plan categories of Operations Plans (OPLAN), Concept Plans (CONPLAN),
or Supporting Plan (SUPPLAN). The plans outlined in Chapter 2 are provided for
informational purposes only.
2.2. HHQ Plans. Define the provisions required when a specific type of plan is established.
These plans types are only written by HHQ or higher level authorities, not at the base level.
     2.2.1. OPLAN. CJCS Joint Pub (JP) 5-0, (Chapter I, para e.15.d) defines an OPLAN as, ―a
     complete and detailed joint plan containing a full description of the concept of operations, all
     annexes applicable to the plan, and a Time Phased Force Deployment Directive (TPFDD). It
     identifies the specific forces, functional support, and resources required to execute the plan
     and provide closure estimates for their flow into the theater. OPLANs can be quickly
     developed into an Operations Order (OPORD).‖ OPLANs and OPORDs prepared in
     response to requirements from the President, the Secretary of Defense, or the CJCS.
     2.2.2. CONPLAN. CJCS JP 5-0, (Chapter I, para e.15.c) defines a CONPLAN as, ―A
     CONPLAN is an operation plan in an abbreviated format that may require considerable
     expansion or alteration to convert it into an OPLAN or OPORD. It includes a base plan with
     annexes required by the Joint Forces Commander and a supported commander‘s estimate of
     the plan‘s feasibility. It may also produce a TPFDD if applicable.‖
     2.2.3. SUPPLAN. AFI10-401, (para3.3.4) states, ―Supporting plans are prepared as tasked
     by the supported combatant commanders in support of their contingency plans‖ This process
     is accomplished by the OPR and coordinated by 52 FW/XPP. Only this type of plan will be
     identified as a 52 FW SUPPLAN XXXX-XX and numbered in accordance with Section 3.9.
2.3. Non-XPP Managed Plans are specific to 52 FW and are formal plans written below
HHQ-level that helps accomplish and record a major action.The plan is archived at the
completion of the event.
     2.3.1. Programming Plan (PPLAN). USAFEI 10-501, Project Task Force, Section B.6
     states ―A PPLAN provides guidance to accomplish a particular one-time, nonrecurring
     project (e.g., unit relocation, unit activation, major weapon system bed down, or base closure
     or drawdown). It documents the project objectives and actions necessary for implementation.
     See AFI 10-501, Program Action Directives (PAD) and Programming Plans (PPLAN)‖.
SPANGDAHLEMABI10-401 21 DECEMBER 2011                                                       9


    2.3.1.1. The PPLAN identifies the objective, schedules tasks, assigns responsibilities,
    and provides a formal reporting system to keep the commander, staff offices, subordinate
    units, and other interested agencies and commands aware of accomplishments. The
    PPLAN provides broad guidance to accomplish a particular one-time, non-recurring
    project (i.e., unit relocation, system acquisition/bed down, or base closure or drawdown).
    It documents the objectives and actions necessary for implementation of the project.

                                          Chapter 3

               PLANS MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

Section 3A—Overview

3.1. General. The 52 FW/XPP office must ensure all UPMs, in particular those who are the
OPR for any plan, understand the correct procedures for conducting the mandatory review
process. The plan review/revision process ensures the data contained within is both current and
accurate. Detailed format guidance for all plans is included in Chapter 4.
3.2. Plan Review Cycle. Unless the review interval is otherwise directed in HHQ guidance, all
52 FW plans are current for 2 years from the date of approval by the 52 FW/CC or the date of its
last formal review.
3.3. Out-of-Cycle Review. The Chief, 52 FW/XPP, a plan OPR, or the OPR‘s unit commander
can direct an out-of-cycle review of their owned plan pending HHQ direction or if changes occur
within their functional area that render the existing plan ineffective.
3.4. Plan Approval. The 52 FW/CC will approve all new plans and/or changes only after they
have gone through the entire revision process. After Group Commanders have approved of the
new or reviewed plan, 52 FW/XPP will coordinate with leadership. After coordination is
complete, 52 FW/XPP will post the completed plan on the 52 FW/XPP SharePoint Plans website
and notify all units listed in Annex Z.
3.5. Suspense Timeline. 52 FW/XPP is responsible for clearly communicating and enforcing
all suspense dates. OPRs and OCRs are responsible for meeting all suspense dates. All requests
for suspense extensions will be sent to 52 FW/XPP. To ensure adherence to timelines and to
prevent late plans publication the Chief, 52 FW/XPP, will follow up with commanders of units
which have exceeded established suspense dates.
3.6. Distribution and Release. The Squadron Commander of the unit and their OPR will work
with 52 FW/XPP to determine the distribution and release list of the plan. Annex Z will contain
this list and is a mandatory document for all plan renditions. 52 FW/XPP will post unclassified
completed plans on the unclassified 52 FW/XPP SharePoint website. Copies of all classified
plans will be stored on the 52 FW/XPP classified SharePoint website.

Section 3B—External HHQ 52 FW Support Plans

3.7. General. Plans developed to support an established HHQ OPLAN, CONPLAN, or
SUPPLAN will be numbered differently than wing level locally generated plans. The plan
coordination procedure will mirror the 52 FW plan procedure as outlined in the plan review
process detailed in section 3E.
   3.7.1. The number assigned to the plan will associate it with the supported plan and the last
   two digits (following a hyphen) are the year the plan was last reviewed (e.g. - 07). This plan
   type will be identified as a 52 FW SUPPLAN XXXX-XX. 52 FW/XPP will approve the
   plan title before coordination efforts are started.
SPANGDAHLEMABI10-401 21 DECEMBER 2011                                                         11


Section 3C—Internal Wing Level Plan Requirements

3.8. General. Internal plans managed by 52 FW/XPP are called 52 FW Plans. The official title
is written as a 52 FW PLAN. Requirement to write a plan is directed by many different sources,
and are all signed by the 52 FW/CC for authority. Unless specifically directed, the 52 FW/CC
has option to keep or delete a plan. Many plans are incorrectly labeled as ―OPLAN‖ because
they contain some type of operational activity. An OPLAN is a unified or major command plan
for fighting a war or contingency operation. The creation of an OPLAN must be approved by the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As such, there are no wing level OPLANS.
3.9. Plans Numbering Policy is accomplished by creating a four digit root number
representing the originating unit and the sequence number for the plan. This root is
followed by a hyphen and a two digit number representing the year the most recent plan review
was accomplished. The plan number is always preceded by 52 FW PLAN.
   3.9.1. Root Number: The first two digits ‗XX‘ pertain to the OPR‘s unit mission as defined
   by the Air Force Record Information Management System (AFRIMS) RDS numbering
   system. The complete list of the AFRIMS numbering system is included in Attachment 13.
   The last two digits represent the sequence within already existing unit plans for the specific
   OPR. This number always begins with ‗01‘ and is incremented by one for each additional
   plan created by the OPR. This four digit number is followed by a hyphen.
   3.9.2. Date Number: The last portion of the plan number will be the two digit year the last
   review was conducted and approved. In the event of a new plan, the two digit year would
   correspond to the year the draft was approved. Only the last two digits of the year are used
   (Ex. 2006 would be written as -06).
       3.9.2.1. 52 FW Plans Numbering Examples:
       3.9.2.2. New 52 FW Plan: A new plan is drafted and approved in 2006 that is Civil
       Engineering (CE) centric and CE is the OPR. The 52d Civil Engineer Squadron (52
       CES) already has two existing plans on file:
          3.9.2.2.1. This plan will be identified by plan number 52 FW PLAN 3203-06. The
          AFRIMS number for CE is ‗32‘. Because 52 CES is already the OPR for two
          existing plans, this new draft will become their third plan. Because this plan was
          drafted and approved in 2006, the last two digits reflect the year date.
       3.9.2.3. Existing Plan: The existing plan 52 FW PLAN 4402-06, the 52d Medical
       Group (52 MDG) is OPR, is revised and approved in 2008. The new number designation
       for this newly approved version of the plan will be 52 FW PLAN 4402-08.
3.10. Task Authority will be listed within the Memorandum of Transmittal of the plan to
explain why the plan exists and the duration the plan must be maintained. A reference to
the applicable AFI/regulations/etc must be mentioned.
3.11. Executive Summary is a document required for all 52 FW Plans. The summary is
generated by the plan OPR and is a detailed overview of data pertaining to the plan. The
summary will be maintained on the 52 FW/XPP Share Point website. The OPR and OCRs of a
plan will include the applicable summaries in their UPM continuity book. Attachment 10
provides the required format for the Executive Summary.
 12                                        SPANGDAHLEMABI10-401 21 DECEMBER 2011


Section 3D—Plans Management Roles Defined

3.12. UPM Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) – Plan Development. This is the UPM
designated as the primary point of contact to facilitate creating the original draft of a new plan or
coordinating changes to a specific established plan. Each plan must be coordinated in
accordance with HHQs and 52 FW/XPP directives outlined in this chapter.
3.13. UPM Offices of Collateral Responsibility (OCRs) – Plan Development. Those are all
other UPMs other than the OPR whose units are involved in the execution of the plan. They are
responsible for ensuring their subordinate units provide pertinent and timely inputs during plans
review and creation routings via the 52 FW/XPP website and to notify their squadron leadership
of any changes to the plan.
3.14. Determining An OPR For A New Plan. If a new plan is required, 52 FW/XPP will
determine the OPR. The OPR will work with 52 FW/XPP to determine the list of OCRs.

Section 3E—Plan Review Coordination Process

3.15. The plans review process remains the same regardless of scheduled or out of
cycle. Upon direction from HHQ or the plan‘s OPR, the 52 FW/XPP will notify all plans OPR‘s
listed in Annex Z of the plan via the website that either a review is to occur or a change is to be
posted.
3.16. Agency Responsibilities. Upon posting, all affected UPMs will have 10 duty days to
review the plan/disseminate to their respective flights, and to ultimately approve, disapprove, or
approve with changes using the ―approval and review‖ and ―change submissions‖ sections on the
plan‘s site.
   3.16.1. If a UPM has ―no changes,‖ they are still required to enter such into the ―Change
   Submission Form‖ submenu on the 52 FW/XPP site. If a unit non-concurs with any aspect
   of the plan, it is the responsibility of their UPM to coordinate a suitable solution with the
   OPR.
   3.16.2. In the event the plan is determined obsolete by the owning Unit Commander, that
   Commander will send a signed email to the 52 FW/XPP organizational box. The email will
   state the plan is now obsolete and can be placed into official records history (IAW AFMAN
   33-363_USAFESUP, Management of Records).
   3.16.3. If the OPR is missing inputs from affected UPMs by the established suspense, on the
   first duty day past the busted suspense the OPR will provide a list of delinquent units to the
   52 FW/XPP org box for support to remedy the delay.
   3.16.4. Once the approvals/changes have been submitted, the OPR will have 5 duty days to
   incorporate the changes into the plan, update the Record of Review and Changes page, and
   send the following documents to the 52 FW/XPP org box.
   3.16.5. Memorandum of Transmittal. The OPR will create an updated Memo of Transmittal.
   Paragraph one will be updated to include the date of the review or change, the date of the
   original Basic Plan and the classification of the plan. This memo must include the Chief, 52
   FW/XPP signature block. It will replace the original Memorandum of Transmittal and will
   have two attachments:
SPANGDAHLEMABI10-401 21 DECEMBER 2011                                                        13


      3.16.5.1. Attachment 1: The revised plan.
      3.16.5.2. Attachment 2: Consolidated change form. To create this, click on ―actions‖ as
      listed on the change/submission section of that plan and export it to a spreadsheet. Save
      the spreadsheet and attach it to the Memorandum of Transmittal.
   3.16.6. Group Commanders will have 5 duty days to review the plan and post changes and
   comments on the ―Change Submission Form‖ section of the 52 FW/XPP site.
   3.16.7. 52 FW/XPP then has 5 duty days to consolidate all group inputs into the plan for
   submission to Wing leadership.

Figure 3.1. Change Submissions Form Sample.




Section 3F—Making Changes to a Plan

3.17. Posting Changes. All changes to either new or revised plans will be made via the
―Change Submissions‖ section of the 52 FW/XPP site. Upload permissions will be limited to
UPMs, Squadron Commanders, and Senior Leadership.
   3.17.1. Guidance on how to post changes is highlighted in the Sharepoint Training located
   in the Plans Documents section on the 52 FW/XPP site.
   3.17.2. Any changes made to existing plan content will drive changes in the plan‘s front data
   (cover page, memo of transmittal, security instructions, record of changes page, plan
   summary, and the basic plan). Per the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual
   5222.03C ―JOPES‖ enclosure A, section H each revised page must have the date and number
   of the change annotated in the upper outside margin, one line below the document
 14                                       SPANGDAHLEMABI10-401 21 DECEMBER 2011


   classification line in addition to a vertical line in the left margin of the page for each revised
   passage.
      3.17.2.1. The example below shows what a change to paragraph 7 would do to the page
      in terms of changes. If editing the content of paragraph 7, enter a black line ½ of an inch
      from the left margin by selecting insert then shapes followed by the line icon. Right
      click on the icon and select format auto-shape and adjust the weight to 3pt. To change
      the header for only a selected page:
          3.17.2.1.1. Place the cursor at the beginning of the page you want to vary the header.
          3.17.2.1.2. On the page layout tab, click the breaks option and select next page
          under .
          3.17.2.1.3. Double click on the header and edit per the guidance above.

Figure 3.2. Changing Header Sample




   3.17.3. All unit changes will be referenced under only one change per that review on the
   Record of Changes page. The example below show what changes made by multiple OCRs
   would do to the Record of Changes page.
      3.17.3.1. Assume the 52 CES altered the procedures in Annex W, 2.A on page 73 and
      the 52 Logistics Readiness Squadron broadened the responsibilities of the petroleum, oil,
      and lubricant flight in Annex D, 4.B and 5.C on pages 19 and 23 of plan ―X‖. The
      suspense to submit changes was 23 Jun 09. The OPR for plan ―X‖ is the 52 MDG and
      their UPM is MSgt Richard James who sent the draft plan to the 52 FW/XPP org box on
      25 Jun 09. The Record of Review and Changes page would look like:
SPANGDAHLEMABI10-401 21 DECEMBER 2011                                                      15


Figure 3.3. Record of Changes Sample.




      3.17.3.2. OPRs must ensure all previous changes from prior reviews are listed before the
      current change. It will replace the plans original Record of Review and Change.

       plan, its changes, and related documents when the plan replaces or updates an existing
       plan. The 52 FW Plans Chief will sign this memorandum. Attachment 1 will always be
       the plan as outlined in the template. Attachment 2 will be a consolidated Plans Change
       Form. See paragraph 3.16.5 for instructions on how to create the document and
       Attachment 2 for the correct template format.
 18                                      SPANGDAHLEMABI10-401 21 DECEMBER 2011


       4.7.2.3. Security Instructions – Document will include any classification guidance (if
       required). It will also include the long and short titles of the plan and should state any
       reproduction limitations. See Attachment 4 for the correct template format.
       4.7.2.4. Record of Review and Change - This document captures any review/changes to

   4.8.1. Numbering. The basic plan pages will numbered ―1‖, ―2‖, etc. through the end of the
   document.
   4.8.2. Required Documents:
       4.8.2.1. Basic Plan - The document will at a minimum consists of three major
       paragraphs; Situation, Mission, Execution. Additional paragraph headings may be
       included to fit the needs of the plan. The template at Attachment 4 provides several
       examples.     This method permits standardization and enables planners to refer
       immediately to a standard paragraph when seeking specific information. Paragraph 3,
       execution includes specific tasks for each area of required support across the wing. The
       tasks are used to create supporting annexes, and associated appendixes, tabs, and exhibits.
4.9. Annexes and Associated Supporting Documentation. This section details the specific
guidance for the format and general content of data in an annex. Appendixes, Tabs, and Exhibits
are additional forms of supporting documents in increasing detail to an Annex. Attachments 5 -
8 provide proper format guides.
   4.9.1. Alpha Annex Designators. Each 52 FW unit is uniquely identified by a specific
   Annex alpha designator. Attachment 11 shows the proper alpha designator for each unit on
   the 52 FW. If a specific unit has not been included, the OPR may use the 7 unused Annex
   Alpha Designators to capture the supporting data. If the OPR requires more than 7 units who
   have not been given a specific alpha designator to provide an Annex, the units who have not
   been assigned an Annex of their own will fall under the applicable Group Level alpha
