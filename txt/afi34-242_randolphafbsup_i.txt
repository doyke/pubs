                                           Chapter 1

                    AIR FORCE MORTUARY AFFAIRS PROGRAM

Section 1A—General Guidance

1.1. Scope. This instruction establishes guidance and assigns responsibilities for the Air Force
Mortuary Affairs program. The mortuary affairs program provides for the recovery, segregation,
identification, care and disposition of the remains of the deceased personnel prescribed in this
instruction in peacetime and wartime across the Range of Military Operations (ROMO). It also
provides guidance for the provision of entitlements and communication with the person
authorized to direct disposition (PADD) of the remains.
   1.1.1. Training. Due to the highly sensitive nature of this program, commanders and
   supervisors at all levels must ensure all personnel involved in the mortuary program are
   properly trained and proficient in the execution of their mortuary duties.
   1.1.2. Mortuary Plans. Current mortuary plans are essential to the proper execution of the
   mortuary affairs program. Mortuary plans must be reviewed frequently and amended as new
   information becomes available and resources change. Since no two situations are alike and
   the number of fatalities can never be predicted, plans should be able to be adjusted to meet
   unanticipated situations. Mortuary support plans will include provisions for individual
   deaths, mass casualties and biochemical contamination.
1.2. Overview of the Mortuary Affairs Program. The Air Force Mortuary Affairs program
provides support across the full range of military operations and is divided into three distinct
programs – the Current Death Program, Concurrent Return Program and Temporary Interment.
Components of these programs include search and recovery (S&R), identification, transportation
of remains, management of government mortuary facilities, and mortuary services.
   1.2.1. The Current Death Program. Under this program eligible personnel are provided with
   professional mortuary services, supplies and related services during peacetime and
   contingency or wartime operations. The Current Death program provides for search, recovery
   and evacuation of remains to a mortuary, where remains of eligible personnel are identified
   and prepared as designated by the PADD and shipped to the final destination for permanent
   disposition. NOTE: This program may continue during a major military operation if tactical
   operations and logistics permit.
   1.2.2. The Concurrent Return Program. The concurrent return program provides for search,
   recovery and evacuation of remains to a mortuary, where remains are identified and prepared
   as directed by the PADD and shipped to the final destination for permanent disposition. This
   is the preferred method of handling remains during periods of conflict. It should be activated
   when the current death program capabilities are exceeded yet conditions do not require
   temporary interment. The concurrent return program may be phased into either the current
   death or temporary interment programs as the situation dictates.
   1.2.3. Temporary Interment Program. This program provides for search, recovery, tentative
   identification and evacuation of deceased personnel to temporary burial sites. This program
   should only be used as a last resort to protect the health and safety of personnel and will only

     be initiated when the tactical situation precludes the return of the remains (e.g., no airframes
     available, numbers of remains, or contamination).
     1.2.4. CONUS/OCONUS Defined. For mortuary purposes, CONUS includes Alaska and
     Hawaii.
1.3. Related Programs.
     1.3.1. The Personal Property and Effects Program. Provides for disposition of personal
     effects and property of missing, captured and deceased Air Force military and civilian
     personnel, which is addressed in detail in AFI 34-244, Disposition of Personal Property and
     Effects.
     1.3.2. The Installation Honor Guard Program. Provides for the rendering of ceremonial
     honors and military funeral honors. Refer to Chapter 8 for honor guard policy.
     1.3.3. The Survivor Assistance Program (AFSAP). The survivor assistance program
     marshals all available resources in support of family needs following unexpected loss of life.
     At the same time, this program is intended to provide a systematic structure that offers
     assistance, information and support made available on the family’s terms. More information
     on the AFSAP can be found in AFI 34-1101, Assistance to Survivors of Persons Killed in
     Aviation Mishaps and Other Incidents.

Section 2E—Transportation of Remains and Funeral Travel.

2.25. Authorized Transportation and Expenses. The Air Force will transport or pay to
transport remains of military personnel from the place of death to the place of interment. Initial
movement of remains is accomplished as follows: A provider pronounces death at the site or the
MTF, prepares a death certificate and gains a decision regarding an autopsy. As authorized by
the base commander, in deaths occurring on the military installation, if an autopsy is to be
performed at the MTF, the MTF provides transportation of the deceased person from the site of
death (or presumed death). If an autopsy will not be performed at the MTF then Mortuary Affairs
is responsible for transportation of remains. The requesting agency or installation O&M funds
will fund transportation costs. Local civil authorities exercise control over the movement of
remains in the event of an off-installation death. Once the remains of an active duty member are
released from the civil authorities, determine if an autopsy will be performed. If affirmative,
medical personnel transport the remains to the MTF. If negative, mortuary services transports the
remains to the contract funeral home or government mortuary. NOTE: In the event of a military
aircraft accident, an autopsy is usually indicated. In the event of multiple casualties/fatalities,
there must be a joint effort between the responsible MTF, Medical Examiner and Mortuary
Affairs personnel. Authorized transportation and costs of military personnel include the
following:
   2.25.1. Removal of remains from place of death or the place the remains are released to the
   mortuary officer then on to the preparing funeral home.
   2.25.2. Delivery of remains by the preparing funeral home to the common carrier.
   2.25.3. Delivery of remains from the common carrier to the receiving funeral home or
   directly to a government cemetery.
   2.25.4. Delivery of remains from the receiving funeral home to the cemetery.
   2.25.5. Common carrier costs.

     2.25.6. Wooden or lightweight shipping container for caskets (only one authorized for deaths
     outside CONUS).
     2.25.7. Consular fees, if required for shipment overseas.
2.26. Transportation of Remains within CONUS (including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto
Rico). The mortuary officer at the place of death, in conjunction with the transportation officer,
will determine the method of shipment to the final destination within CONUS by commercial
carrier or ground transportation, or to the aerial port, if remains are to be shipped outside
CONUS. Contact the Dover AFB, Port Mortuary officer for the requirements for shipping to a
foreign country. One of the following methods or a combination of methods may be used:
     2.26.1. Commercial Aircraft. Remains may be shipped within CONUS, arranged by contract
     mortuary/funeral home, using commercial documentation for movement. Commercial
     carriers require casketed remains be shipped in an outer shipping container. A wooden or
     lightweight outer shipping container protects the casket and the remains during shipment.
     This is an authorized transportation expense.
     2.26.2. Hearse or Service Car. A hearse or a service car will be used for overland
     transportation within CONUS, if commercial air is not available, or the cost for air travel is
     greater than the cost for overland transport. Overland transportation will be used within and
     outside CONUS, if requested by the PADD and they agree to pay any costs in excess of the
     cost to the government to transport the remains by air. EXCEPTION: All remains transported
     overland from Dover Port Mortuary will be transported via hearse.
     2.26.3. Government Aircraft. Government aircraft is only authorized for use in CONUS,
     including Alaska and Hawaii, for the removal of remains from an accident site (a mass
     fatality incident or as directed by the Office of the Armed Force Medical Examiner
     [OAFME]) to the nearest adequate military installation for medical examination. Remains
     will transported in transfer cases. No cargo will be loaded on top of transfer cases containing
     human remains. However, if more than one transfer case containing remains is shipped or
     stored, stacking is permitted, but should be avoided if at all possible. The maximum number
     of human remains transfer cases that may be safely transported on a single 463L pallet is 12.
     Place cases in three rows, each row stacked to a maximum of four. AMCI 34-501 provides
     more detailed transfer case shipping protocol.
        2.26.3.1. The use of DOD–owned or –controlled aircraft, other than listed above, must
        be authorized at the Military Service Vice Chief of Staff (VCS) level. The Service VCS
        may authorize the use of their own organic airlift to transport remains. To use Air Force-
        owned or –controlled aircraft, the respective supported Military VCS will forward a
        request to HQ USAF/A1. USAF/A1S (Services) will staff the request to the VCSAF for
        approval/disapproval. The VCSAF will approve if resources are available.
        2.26.3.2. Remains transiting Dover Port Mortuary - when the Military Service Mortuary
        Affairs Office of the decedent(s), in coordination with the Director, Dover AFB Port
        Mortuary, determines that a commercial mode will not meet mission requirements, or that
        DOD–owned or –controlled airlift support is most appropriate for the mission; for
        example, in the case of mass casualties or when multiple casualties are traveling to a
        common location at the same time. (see para 2.28 for theater of war fatalities)
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                        29


2.27. Transportation of Remains from OCONUS. Remains will be transported from the
place of death to the nearest OCONUS mortuary facility by military airlift, if available. Remains
located in Keflavik, Greenland, Antigua, Ascension, Lajes and locations in Latin and South
America will be shipped by military airlift directly to the Dover Port Mortuary whenever
possible. Some OCONUS locations may require coordination between HQ AFSVA/SVOM, the
losing unit, the Air Tactical Operations Center (ATOC) and in some cases, commercial mortuary
services and airlines.
   2.27.1. Transportation from a Mortuary Facility in USAFE. Government aircraft will be
   used to transport remains located in USAFE to the Dover Port Mortuary. Upon release of
   remains by the AFME and/or the preparing mortuary, all eligible remains will be transported
   to Dover facility on the first available aircraft on a space-required basis, unless directed
   otherwise by the PADD. Contact HQ USAFE/A7SXM for flight information.
       2.27.1.1. The remains must be moved to the final destination as quickly as possible.
       Contact HQ USAFE/A7SXM for assistance in diverting a flight to the area if there is no
       scheduled flight or if the movement of remains is delayed for 18 or more hours.
       2.27.1.2. When being transported by government aircraft, remains should be uncasketed
       and placed in an aluminum transfer case. No cargo will be loaded on top of transfer cases
       containing human remains. However, if more than one transfer case containing remains is
       shipped or stored, stacking is permitted, but should be avoided if at all possible. The
       maximum number of human remains transfer cases that may be safely transported on a
       single 463L pallet is 12. Place cases in three rows, each row stacked to a maximum of
       four. AMCI 34-501 provides more detailed transfer case shipping protocol.
       2.27.1.3. Remains will not be delayed or off-loaded en route except in a case of extreme
       emergency or as required by operational transfers and routing.
       2.27.1.4. Remains will not be moved to any CONUS base other than the Dover Port
       Mortuary without prior approval of HQ AFSVA/SVOM or when diversion of the flight is
       necessary because of weather or other adverse flying conditions. Coordination with the
       AFME is required if remains are under their jurisdiction.
   2.27.2. Transportation of Remains from a Mortuary Facility in PACAF. For remains located
   outside CONUS, under United States Air Forces in the Pacific (PACAF), casketed remains,
   prepared by Air Force Mortuary, Okinawa or a mortuary located in Guam or Korea will be
   transported by commercial carrier direct to destination from these locations.
2.28. Transportation of Remains from the Dover Port Mortuary. Military remains received
from theatre of war will be transported to final destination via dedicated military air or military-
contracted aircraft unless the PADD selects commercial air. For other remains received at the
Port Mortuary, the mortuary officer and the transportation officer will determine the best method
of shipment between the Port Mortuary and final destination. If feasible, remains will be shipped
to the final destination within 24 hours after arrival at the Port Mortuary.
   2.28.1. The provision of dedicated military or military-contracted aircraft is extended to
   cover those Service members who initially survive their illness or injuries sustained in a
   combat theater of operation but die elsewhere from those injuries received or illness
   contracted in the AOR(e.g., medical treatment facility in CONUS) and whose remains do not
   transit through Dover AFB.

2.29. Stopover Requests. Arrangements will be made to transport remains to a stopover
location for a funeral service en route to the place of final interment, if requested by the PADD.
The cost for transporting remains from the common carrier terminal to the funeral location and
back to the common carrier terminal is an expense that must be paid by the PADD. However,
such costs may be applied toward secondary expense (interment) allowance.
2.30. Prohibition of Arrival Ceremonies and Media Coverage. There will be no arrival
ceremonies for, or media coverage of, deceased military personnel returning to or departing from
Ramstein AB, Hickam AFB or Dover AFB, to include interim stops. Service members will
receive proper honors for their service to their country at the interment site. Any memorial
services are the responsibility of the service members’ unit. The prohibition on media coverage
of movement of remains includes the movement of remains at any point (e.g., from treatment
facility to transport, from transport to interim stop, from interim stop to airlift, from airlift to
mortuary, etc.).
2.31. Funeral Travel Eligibility. Military members in paragraphs 2.2 – 2.6 are entitled to have

Section 2F—Mortuary Entitlements for Military Members under Unusual Circumstances.

2.35. Absent Without Leave (AWOL). Members who die while AWOL are eligible for the
same mortuary benefits as personnel who die on active duty, unless they are dropped from the
active duty rolls prior to death.
2.36. A Military Member Dropped From the Rolls. A military member who is dropped from
the active duty rolls has no mortuary entitlements. The Air Force is not responsible for the
remains or for the payment or reimbursement of any mortuary expenses. The PADD must
arrange and pay for the disposition of the remains.
2.37. Undetermined Military Status. If the status of a military member is undetermined, the
mortuary officer will ask the PADD to make all arrangements for care and disposition of the
remains and have them submit a claim to the Air Force (HQ AFSVA/SVOM) for evaluation and
reimbursement determination.
2.38. Death in a Veteran’s Affairs (VA) Hospital. When a military member dies in a VA
medical facility, the nearest active duty Air Force installation will assume mortuary affairs
responsibility.
2.39. Body Not Recoverable (BNR). A BNR is any individual who has been declared dead and
circumstances or conditions do not permit recovery of the remains. The decedent is entitled to a
memorial service, military honors, funeral travel and the authorized number of interment flags
and flag cases. The VA will provide a memorial marker for a government or a non-government
cemetery memorial plot. The PADD should be reimbursed for memorial service expenses not to
exceed the amount allowed for a funeral with subsequent interment in a government cemetery.
2.40. Vietnam Prisoners of War (POWs) or Missing in Action (MIA). Families of military
members who died while a POW or who have been designated as MIA during the Vietnam
conflict and whose remains are returned to the United States after 27 January 1973 are

Rico, or any territory or possession of the US). Invitational travel will be issued. Family
members authorized to travel to the funeral include:
   2.40.1. The surviving spouse, (including a remarried surviving spouse).
   2.40.2. Children, and stepchildren of any age (See NOTE 1 in Table 2.2).

     2.40.4. If none of the above family members desire to use their travel entitlement, the
     member’s siblings, half siblings, adopted siblings and stepbrothers and stepsisters may be
     considered eligible family members for the travel entitlement.
2.41. Group interment. When the Office Armed Forces Medical Examiner cannot individually
identify the remains of two or more military personnel, they will be interred as a group in a
government cemetery. Funeral travel is authorized.
2.42. Disinterment. Disinterment and transportation will not be provided at Air Force expense
unless the government temporarily interred the remains to comply with local health laws or the
mortuary officer was unable to reach the PADD to provide disposition instructions. Disinterment
and transportation within CONUS requires special permission of the health authorities at the
place of disinterment and in some instances at the point of destination. Disinterred remains will
be sealed in an airtight container to prevent the escape of leakage and odors.

                                           Chapter 3

          MORTUARY ACTIONS FOR DECEASED MILITARY PERSONNEL

Section 3A—Recovery of Remains and Initial Mortuary Actions

3.1. Purpose. This chapter prescribes mortuary officer actions required for deceased active duty
military personnel.
3.2. Mortuary Officer Actions (to include Government Morticians) That Will Not Be
Delegated.
   3.2.1. Briefing the PADD.
   3.2.2. Verifying remains are positively identified.
   3.2.3. Inspecting remains and casket.
3.3. Actions Upon Notification of a Death. When notified of an active duty death, the
mortuary officer (nearest the place of death) will:
   3.3.1. Open a new mortuary case file and document pertinent information in the mortuary
   log to include the date and time of the call and the location and condition of the remains.
   Determine who has jurisdiction over the remains and start the Mortuary Checklist located at
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-DP-AE-12.
   3.3.2. Immediately notify HQ AFSVA/SVOM, MAJCOM, and HQ USAF/A1S for deaths
   that result from suicide, homicide, or aircraft accidents and for deceased Services personnel
   or deaths occurring in Services facilities.
   3.3.3. Verify the remains have been positively identified. (Refer to paragraphs 7.2 and 7.3
   for instructions on establishing positive ID.) If remains cannot be positively identified and
   local ID support is not available, the mortuary officer will contact HQ AFSVA/SVOM for ID
   assistance. NOTE: the mortuary officer will keep the PADD informed daily on the status of
   identification and progress of S&R (if S&R was required).
   3.3.4. If the decedent sustained disfiguring head or facial injuries, the mortuary officer will
   immediately verify if and how positive identification (ID) was made and will notify HQ
   AFSVA/SVOM of verification. If remains cannot be identified, the mortuary officer should
   contact HQ AFSVA/SVOM, for ID assistance, if local ID support is not available. The
   mortuary officer will not brief the PADD on mortuary entitlements until the remains have
   been recovered and positively identified. In the interim, the mortuary officer should keep the
   PADD informed daily on the status of identification and progress of S&R (if S&R was
   required).
3.4. Recovery and Movement of Remains. The mortuary officer will determine how to
recover and move the remains, depending upon the situation. Initial movement of remains will be
accomplished in the following manner:
   3.4.1. On Base. If a death occurs on a military installation, or under federal jurisdiction, and
   it has been determined an autopsy is not required, mortuary affairs personnel will arrange for
   the transportation of remains to the appropriate location (contract funeral home or
   government mortuary). Initial movement of remains is accomplished as follows: A provider
36                                      AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


     pronounces death at the site or the MTF, prepares a death certificate and gains a decision
     regarding an autopsy. As authorized by the base commander, in deaths occurring on the
     military installation, if an autopsy is to be performed at the MTF, the MTF provides
     transportation of the deceased person from the site of death (or presumed death). If an
     autopsy will not be performed at the MTF then Mortuary Affairs is responsible for arranging
     transportation of remains. The requesting agency (requesting an off installation autopsy) or
     installation O&M funds will fund transportation costs. Upon release of remains, mortuary
     funds will pay for transportation costs of the remains to the preparing funeral home.
     3.4.2. Off Base. In the event of an off-base death, local civil authorities exercise control over
     the movement of remains. Once local authorities release the remains, a determination must
     be made if an autopsy is to be done by the AFME.
        3.4.2.1. If an autopsy is not required, mortuary affairs personnel will arrange for
        transport of the remains from the place of death or local holding site, to the contract
        funeral home or government mortuary.
        3.4.2.2. If an autopsy is required, HQ AFSVA/SVOM will work with the OAFME and
        determine the method of transportation of remains.
     3.4.3. Mass Fatalities/Aircraft Mishaps (On Base). Deceased and those subsequently
     pronounced dead at the scene would remain at the site of death pending investigation
     completion. Remains will be disturbed as little as possible so as not to destroy evidence.
     Following release of remains by the Incident Commander, mortuary affairs personnel will
     arrange for the transport of remains to the nearest facility with a morgue as determined by the
     MTF commander. MTF personnel may assist if it will not interfere with patient care
     activities.
     3.4.4. Mass Fatalities/Aircraft Mishaps Off Base. Mass fatalities will be handled according
     to local agreements.
     3.4.5. Movement of Remains for Reprocessing. If civil authorities have transferred remains
     to a funeral home for postmortem examination and embalming without Air Force or PADD
     direction, the mortuary office will arrange for the reprocessing, dressing and casketing of the
     remains if directed by the PADD. Mortuary affairs will arrange for movement of the remains
     to the contract funeral home.
     3.4.6. Death Aboard an Aircraft, Train, or Ship. When a military member’s death occurs
     aboard an aircraft, train, or ship, the remains will be removed at the first stop. The mortuary
     officer at the nearest Air Force installation (rather than the mortuary office at the home
     installation) will brief the PADD, obtain disposition instructions and arrange for mortuary
     services.
     3.4.7. Movement of Remains OCONUS. Movement will be accomplished according to local
     agreements (Status of Forces Agreements, STANAGS, etc.)
     3.4.8. Notification for Movement of Remains to the Aerial Port. The AMC traffic
     representative at the originating terminal will send the remains movement notification
     immediately upon determination of the transportation schedule. Schedule changes will be
     reported promptly. If a delay occurs en route, the airfreight officer at the station of delay will
     notify the Aerial Port and other concerned offices of the reason for the delay and the new
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                     37

       personnel and dependents.
       3.4.8.5. HQ USCG/G-PSI, US COAST GUARD Washington DC 20590 for Coast Guard
       members.
3.5. Verification of Military Status and Entitlements. A member of the mortuary affairs
office will contact the Military Personnel Flight (MPF) and deceased member’s unit.
   3.5.1. Obtain information listed in the deceased member’s records to determine the person(s)
   authorized to direct disposition for the remains and personal property, as it may not be the
   same person.
   3.5.2. Verify the decedent’s military status to confirm eligibility for active duty mortuary
   entitlements, prior to briefing the PADD.
   3.5.3. Obtain a list of the decedent’s awards, decorations, and badges for the uniform and the
   hardwood flag cases. This information will be given to the installation rendering military
   funeral honors, so they may prepare the hardwood flag case(s). NOTE: For burials at ANC,
   the shipping base will prepare the flag case(s). NOTE: Per AFI 36-3026(I), Identification
   Cards for Members of the Uniformed Services, Their Eligible Family Members, and Other
   Eligible Personnel, the Identification (ID) Card will not be surrendered to the PADD or any
   surviving family member. It will be surrendered to the nearest issuing activity.
3.6. Initial Contact With the PADD. The mortuary officer will verify Casualty Affairs has
notified the PADD of the death. Once it’s been determined the PADD has been notified, the
mortuary officer will contact the PADD within two hours of notification to set up an
appointment to brief entitlements. The PADD should not be contacted after 2200 hrs local or
before 0800 hrs unless they specifically request it.
3.7. Securing Personal Property and Effects. The mortuary officer will request that the
decedent’s squadron commander locate and secure personal property and effects under
Government control pending the appointment of an SCO. If the decedent’s residence and/or
property are located off base and the PADD is not present or does not live with the deceased, the
appropriate civil authority (i.e., coroner, police, fire, sheriff etc.) should be contacted.
3.8. SCO Appointment. The mortuary officer will request the installation commander appoint
an SCO to assist the Person Legally Eligible to Receive Effects (PERE) with disposition of the
personal property and effects of the decedent.
38                                     AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


3.9. Appointment of a Family Liaison Officer (FLO). The mortuary officer will ensure a
FLO is appointed by the installation commander to carry out duties IAW AFI 34-1101 and notify
MAJCOM and HQ USAF/A1S of FLO assignment within 24 hours of appointment.
3.10. Submitting the Initial Death Report (RCS: HAF-SVA (AR) 9471).                           HQ
AFSVA/SVOM must be notified of all Air Force deaths. An initial death report must be
submitted using e-mail with ―Request a read receipt‖ for each sent message to
SVOM@randolph.af.mil. Refer to Table 3.1 for the required information and format. To
insure prompt notification, also fax the initial death message to HQ AFSVA/SVOM at DSN 487-
5809. The initial death report must be submitted as soon as the mortuary officer learns of a death

3.12. PADD Entitlements Briefing. The mortuary officer will brief the PADD on all
authorized mortuary entitlements and persons authorized to travel to attend the funeral (Table
2.2). Prior to meeting with or briefing the PADD, the mortuary officer must ensure they are
adequately prepared. The mortuary officer must know the mortuary entitlements authorized for
active duty military personnel, prepare an AF Form 57, Mortuary Guide and know what they
should ask the PADD regarding their disposition preferences, using the PADD Briefing Guide
located at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-DP-AE-12 .
During the briefing, the mortuary officer must be sensitive; answer questions clearly; avoid
40                                     AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


discussing issues Casualty Affairs should address and be prepared to forward questions to other
appropriate agencies.
     3.12.1. If PADD Resides in Local Area (CONUS). If the PADD lives in the local area, the
     mortuary officer must brief them in person. Once the briefing has been accomplished, the
     mortuary officer will complete AF Form 970, Statement on Disposition of Remains and have
     the PADD initial and sign where indicated on the form. This form provides written
     verification of the PADD’s disposition instructions.
     3.12.2. Does Not Reside in Local Area (CONUS). If the PADD is not in the local area, the
     mortuary officer will brief them by telephone. The PADD will be sent a confirmation letter,
     by overnight express delivery (for a sample confirmation letter, go to
     https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-DP-AE-12) referencing
     the phone call and confirming disposition instructions. A copy of the letter and a
     memorandum for record will be placed in the mortuary case file and is considered an
     acceptable substitute for the AF Form 970. NOTE: There are times when the PADD may
     request a face-to-face briefing on mortuary entitlements. Before taking any action, the
     mortuary officer in charge of the case must first coordinate with HQ AFSVA/SVOM on how
     to handle this exception to policy.
     3.12.3. OCONUS Death/PADD Resides in CONUS. HQ AFSVA/SVOM will brief the
     PADD on all mortuary entitlements, travel and status updates on remains, obtain disposition
     instructions for the remains and the personal property and provide applicable instructions to
     the overseas installation handling the death and the applicable Aerial Port.
     3.12.4. OCONUS Death/ PADD Resides OCONUS. The installation mortuary officer will:
        3.12.4.1. Brief PADD on mortuary entitlements.
        3.12.4.2. Ensure an overseas government mortuary facility prepares the remains or ices
        them down in an aluminum transfer case, as applicable. Military aircraft will transport the

     leader is the Mortuary Officer or alternate.
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                      67


   6.5.2. Installations without military personnel assigned to the Force Support Squadron, will
   be supported by the FSRT postured in the AEF pair when the incident occurs. The unit
   Director and an alternate is required to be trained in standard installation S&R operations and
   capable of advising base leadership on proper procedures until the FSRT arrives. NOTE: An
   installation commander without FSS military members may chose to retain installation S&R
   capability. To do so, he must assign, in writing, 10 military members to serve as members of
   the S&R team. The FSS Director must ensure the members received all required training and
   immunizations.
6.6. Determining Level of Response. Based up on information received from the incident site,
HQ AFSVA/SVOM will determine whether a FSRT team is required. As a guideline, incidents
with three or more commingled remains will likely require a FSRT team. The Mortuary Officer
should always contact AFSVA/SVOM immediately upon notification of an incident to ensure
proper and timely response above what an installation can provide.
6.7. S&R Capability Limitations. S&R teams can only operate in an environment of known
hazards so members can be properly trained and equipped. The installation’s Civil Engineering
Readiness offices will define the hazards of the incident. Currently, S&R teams are not capable
of operating in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, or Nuclear (CBRN) environment.
6.8. Obtaining Disposition Instructions During S&R Operations. Under no circumstances
will disposition instructions be requested from the PADD, nor will incomplete remains be
released for shipment to destination, before recovery operations are terminated and positive
identification is established.
6.9. Roles and Responsibilities.
   6.9.1. HQ AFSVA/SVOM. Will provide training and advice on S&R programs.

5. Helicopter availability, for site survey.

6. Establishment of a base camp when necessary; i.e., if there is a lengthy S&R and the location is
distant from the nearest installation. The base camp should be established at the end of the line of
communications and near the search area. This should ensure that full support (medical/food/shelter) is
available in the event of inclement weather or injuries, etc. If situation permits, S&R personnel should
operate from the base camp, returning after completing each day’s S&R effort.

7. Number of S&R personnel available.

8. Size, shape, and terrain of search areas.

9. Initial direction of search pattern.

10. Spacing between S&R team members.

11. Search area entrance and exit points.
       6.12.3.13. Inform the PADD of S&R status. NOTE: Because of the possibility of
       subsequent recovery when remains are not intact, the mortuary officer should not request
       disposition instructions prior to termination of aircraft salvage operations without the
       approval of HQ AFSVA/SVOM. The MAJCOM mortuary affairs supervisor and HQ
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                       73


     AFSVA/SVOM should be advised of salvage operation status changes by e-mail
     (SVOM@randolph.af.mil).
     6.12.3.14. Ensure S&R team members receive intervention from the Traumatic Stress
     Response Team IAW AFI 44-153, Traumatic Stress Response. at the conclusion of the

     6.12.4.7. Record search coverage.
     6.12.4.8. Obtain primary and alternate communications frequencies and schedules from
     the appropriate base agencies and establish communications with the base camp or base,
     as appropriate. Equip the leaders with radios, portable megaphones, whistles, or similar
     items and copies of the sketch map of the mishap site to facilitate communications when
     deployed.
  6.12.5. Senior Medical Officer. Will ensure:
     6.12.5.1. On-scene medical support is provided during S&R operations.
     6.12.5.2. Remains are released to the mortuary officer for processing following
     completion of all medical actions.
  6.12.6. The Safety Investigation Board (SIB). Investigates mishaps when there has been loss
  of life. The board is usually on scene within 72 hours following a mishap. The Incident
  Commander assumes control of the scene. The SIB President assumes control of the safety
  investigation under the provisions of AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. The SIB
  Medical Officer trained in life support systems will be responsible for the life sciences aspect
  of the investigation and will supervise the identification process.
  6.12.7. The Interim Safety Investigation Board (ISB) Medical Officer. The ISB Medical
  Officer and the mortuary officer assigned by the commander of the Air Force base nearest
  the mishap will initially collect life sciences evidence in an aircraft mishap. This will be done
  before the permanent SIB Medical Officer arrives. Together they will accomplish the
  following:
     6.12.7.1. Preserve perishable evidence, to include video and still photography at the
     mishap site, collecting laboratory samples, completing radiological studies and obtaining
     initial witness statements.
74                                     AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


        6.12.7.2. Ensure nonperishable evidence associated with human remains (life support
        equipment, aircraft egress systems, etc.) is left undisturbed at the mishap site.
        6.12.7.3. Contact the Air Force Institute of Pathology (AFIP) to coordinate forensic
        pathology assistance. AFIP can be reached via telephone at any time through DSN 285-
        0000 or commercial (301) 319-0000.
        6.12.7.4. Facilitate access of the AFIP medical examiner to the dead and injured.
        6.12.7.5. Obtain health and dental records of the decedents.
     6.12.8. CE will provide GPS and/or optical survey equipment and trained personnel to plot
     remains, personal effects, and aircraft wreckage. Daily maps will be produced and archived
     to reflect S&R progress.
6.13. Search Operations Instructions. Refer to AFH 10-247, Volume 4, Guide to Services
Contingency Planning: Mortuary Affairs Search and Recovery, for detailed instructions.
6.14. Recovery Operations Instructions. Recovery is the most important and demanding
phase of the field operation and is time sensitive. Valuable investigative information,
identification of remains and mishap clues can easily be destroyed by hasty or incomplete
recovery actions. The mortuary officer will work closely with the director of base medical
services or the ISB/SIB Medical Officer to ensure remains are properly examined, staked,
tagged, photographed and plotted using GPS before removal. When GPS is not available, hand-
drawn maps or sketches will be used.
     6.14.1. Recovery unit operations must be carefully coordinated, since the tagging and
     designation of remains and portions of remains is vitally important in later examination of
     these remains.
     6.14.2. The recovery unit will consist of approximately eight members (the size of the
     recovery unit depends upon the circumstances of each operation), a photographer provided
     by audiovisual and a unit leader. This selection provides efficient use of manpower as well as
     an available source of replacements.
     6.14.3. Remains are usually dismembered and/or burned. In many mishaps, there may not be
     100% recovery. Unit members must handle remains with the utmost care to ensure against
     loss or destruction of valuable identification media or evidence. NOTE: No remains will be
     moved or disturbed without the consent of the ISB/SIB Medical Officer or Incident
     Commander.
     6.14.4. Use helicopters, if available, to visually survey the terrain and assist in determining
     the overall area to be searched.
6.15. The Recovery Process.
     6.15.1. Each stake will be marked with the appropriate letter designation: R for intact
     remains and P for partial or fragmented remains. Each letter will be followed by sequential
     numbering (example, R-1, P-1, P-2) using consecutive recovery numbers for each stake. A
     ―P‖ designation should be given for any remains that are not 100 percent complete.
     6.15.2. When a GPS is available, the location of each stake will be plotted to include ―R‖,
     ―P‖ or ―E‖ numbers (―E‖ denotes personal effects).
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                   75


   6.15.3. Three tags will be used for each remains (or portion thereof) found. The R- or P-
   number must be written on each tag. One tag will be attached to the stake. The second tag
   will be attached to the remains. The third tag will be attached to the human remains pouch
   (HRP) or Ziploc type bag.
   6.15.4. A color photograph must be taken of each remains with the tag’s ―R- or P-number‖
   showing. The photograph or videotape must include a close-up shot of the remains and an
   image depicting the remains in relationship to the majority of the wreckage or the mishap
   scene.
   6.15.5. The remains will be carefully placed in a human remains pouch or plastic bag.
   Handling should be minimized to prevent undue damage.
   6.15.6. The ground beneath the remains and the immediate area should be carefully
   examined to assure all portions are recovered.
   6.15.7. Once a photo has been taken of the remains, the third tag, marked with the same R-
   or P-number, must be securely attached to the outside of the pouch or plastic bag.
   6.15.8. The remains must be iced or refrigerated as soon as possible to reduce degradation
   and transported by mortuary personnel to the temporary collection point or morgue.
   6.15.9. Additional information required on each tag is as follows: Recovery mission number
   (assigned by HQ AFSVA/SVOM), Recovery Organization, Branch of Service, Date,
   Believed to Be (BTB) name if available or appropriate (place the BTB information on the tag
   reverse side). Exceptions to this policy will be considered when there are large numbers of
   small fragmented portions. A master tag should be affixed to the HRP with the info above to
   include the sequential P-numbers contained inside the HRP (i.e., P1-P300). All fragmented
   portions will be individually bagged and tagged with the appropriate P-number.
   6.15.10. On scene Mortuary Officer/HQ AFSVA/SVOM will provide guidance and request
   the AIB and/or SIB President to retain either recovered remains on scene, or at a central
   holding location until S&R is terminated.
6.16. Termination of S&R. HQ AFSVA/SVOM and the MAJCOM will be notified
telephonically when S&R operations are terminated. Frequently, portions of remains are found
adhered to or under aircraft parts. Leave a team leader and at least five S&R team members at
the scene to be present during salvage operations should there be subsequent recovery. NOTE:
Because of the possibility of subsequent recovery when remains are not intact, the mortuary
officer must not request disposition instructions prior to termination of aircraft salvage
operations without the approval of HQ AFSVA/SVOM. The MAJCOM mortuary affairs
supervisor and HQ AFSVA/SVOM will be kept advised of salvage operation status changes by
e-mail.
6.17. Recovered Personal Property and Effects.
   6.17.1. Personal property and effects will not be removed from remains at the mishap site.
   This will include official cards (line badge, ID card, etc.) and papers, nametags and
   accoutrements from remains at the mishap site. These items will be left with the remains, to
   preserve supportive identification evidence.
   6.17.2. Personal effects (PE) found loose at the site will be annotated on the site map and
   placed in plastic bags secured with wire tie shipping tags. The letter "E" will be indicated
76                                      AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


     (denoting personal effects) on each tag followed by the consecutive recovery number E-1, E-
     2, etc. The items must be safeguarded and delivered to the identification processing facility.
     S&R personnel will be directly responsible for loose personal effects. They will inventory the
     PE and annotate DD Form 1076, Personal Property and Personal Effects Inventory.
     6.17.3. There should not be any attempt to re-associate personal property or accoutrements
     found loose at the mishap site until the remains are processed and identified. If an item is
     believed to be associated with remains, note on the reverse side ―associated with‖ R-number
     or P-number.
6.18. Handling Recovered Remains. Since medical and life support clues are time sensitive
and fragile, it is imperative that no remains be disturbed after recovery until the Medical Officer
conducts the investigation. It is especially important that clothing and equipment remain intact.
Usually, the Medical Officer has the medical records at the time of examination and autopsy.
The ISB/SIB Medical Officer will supervise the identification process. If positive identification
cannot be established, HQ AFSVA/SVOM personnel responding to the mishap will assist the
Medical Officer from the agency that has jurisdiction (local coroner, medical examiner or
AFME) with identification. The Medical Officer will release the remains to the mortuary officer
for processing following completion of all medical actions. NOTE: Clothing and equipment
removed from remains will not be destroyed without Medical Officer coordination.
     6.18.1. Preservation of Remains. The remains must be refrigerated at a temperature of 38 to
     40 degrees Fahrenheit or 3.3 to 4.4 degrees Centigrade. If refrigeration equipment is not
     readily available, pack bagged remains in ice or ice packs in insulated chests or in a transfer
     case, depending on size of the remains. Ice will not be placed directly on remains.
     6.18.2. Facilities for Processing Remains (Temporary Morgue). Ensure that the facility used
     for identification processing of remains can be secured, has proper ventilation and good
     lighting, has hot and cold running water, sufficient floor space for simultaneous processing of
     remains, and loading/unloading areas that can be screened from public view. Aircraft hangar
     or warehouses are suitable structures. Gymnasiums and other Services facilities used to serve
     customers should be used as a last resort. Installations will identify facilities to be used as a
     temporary morgue in their installation mortuary plans.
     6.18.3. Forensic Pathology Investigations. Title 10 USC, Sec 1471, Under regulations
     prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, the Armed Forces Medical Examiner may conduct a
     forensic pathology investigation to determine the cause or manner of death of a deceased
     person.
6.19. Building Searches. A floor-by-floor and room-by-room search will be accomplished
when conducting search and recovery operations in buildings that have been damaged or
destroyed by explosions, fire, aircraft, or weather. Building should be determined to be
structurally safe before search and recovery team enters it. Numbering system for remains and
personal effects should reflect floor and room number (i.e., F1R320X-1 would represent a
remains recovered on first floor, room 320.) Search and recovery operations may be under the
control of civil authorities (i.e., location is a federal crime scene). In cases where remains are in
damaged structures close coordination with the fire department and structural safety
representative is essential. If the structure is not sound, remains will be recovered as debris is
removed. Advance coordination with your base fire department is needed to ensure the assistance
of the Urban Search and Rescue team is available.

6.20. After Action Comments. NLT 30 days after completion of S&R operations, the mortuary
officer will submit after action comments to HQ AFSVA/SVOM through their MAJCOM.
Include the location of the incident, the start and end date of S&R operations, the number of
fatalities, lessons learned or limiting factors and recommendations for improvement.

                               IDENTIFICATION OF REMAINS

Section 7A—General Identification (ID) Policy.

7.1. Overview. It is the policy of the Air Force to individually segregate and identify remains of
all deceased personnel to the fullest extent possible and to use all available means and scientific
resources to accomplish this. No information concerning identification will be released until final
conclusions are established on all remains.
7.2. The ID Process When Remains Are Recognizable. If the remains are recognizable,
presumptive identification will be established using DD Form 565, Statement of Recognition of
Deceased. Identification based on circumstantial evidence, such as wallet contents or car
registration is not acceptable. Remains will not be classified as unidentifiable or unknown until
an Air Force mortuary specialist has made a complete review of the case and processed the
remains.
7.3. The ID Process When Remains Are Not Recognizable. If remains are not recognizable,
scientific means must be used to establish a positive ID. Scientific identification may include the
use of dental, finger or footprint, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), or other scientific means as
directed by AFME or the agency with local jurisdiction. If local ID support is not available, the
mortuary officer should contact HQ AFSVA/SVOM, for ID assistance. The mortuary officer will
not brief the PADD on mortuary entitlements until the remains have been positively identified.
In the interim, the PADD should be kept informed daily on the status of identification.
     7.3.1. Remains will be officially designated as individually identified when it is concluded,
     with medical certainty using all identification media available, that the identification findings
     are in scientific agreement with an individual by name.
     7.3.2. Remains will be officially designated as unidentified when it is concluded the
     scientific identification process does not associate those remains with any individual by
     name. Remains will be placed under refrigeration pending arrival of an Air Force mortuary
     specialist.
NOTE: No remains are officially designated as unidentified or unknown until an Air Force
mortuary specialist makes a complete review of the case.
     7.3.3. Multiple, commingled remains that cannot be identified will not be apportioned to the
     known number of individuals who die in a common accident for release to the PADD.
     Remains will not be classified as unidentifiable or unknown until an Air Force mortuary
     specialist has made a complete review of the case and processed the remains. Remains that
     cannot be individually identified will be interred as a group.
     7.3.4. When remains of United States (US) armed forces personnel and remains of foreign
     personnel are involved in the same accident outside CONUS and identification cannot be
     promptly established, HQ AFSVA/SVOM will be contacted for identification assistance.
7.4. ID Documentation Requirements. Identification conclusions will be documented on:
     7.4.1. AF Form 697, Identification Findings and Conclusions
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                     79

   7.4.3. AF Form 1802, Ante Mortem Dental Record
   7.4.4. AF Form 1803, Dental Identification Summary Report.
7.5. ID Process for Mass Fatalities. In the event of a mass fatality (defined as five or more
American fatalities involved in a common incident):
   7.5.1. In CONUS. For all mass fatalities in CONUS, the Medical Officer from the
   responding installation will notify AFIP/OAFME. The location to perform the identification
   and pathological examinations will be determined jointly by HQ AFSVA/SVOM,
   AFIP/OAFME, and the applicable MAJCOM/A1S.
   7.5.2. OCONUS. Once S&R operations have been terminated, remains will be moved
   promptly to the Dover AFB Port Mortuary facility for identification and pathological
   examinations. Remains must not be moved before termination of S&R occurs. The OAFME
   medical examiner must be notified to examine the bodies. When remains are being shipped
   to Dover, they will be placed in a transfer case with sufficient wet ice or chemical gel packs
   to retard decomposition during transit. HQ AFSVA/SVOM and the applicable MAJCOM
   will be notified of shipment, using the movement of remains message format at Table 3.3
   Applicable records listed in Table 7.1 and all other documents generated in the processing of
   the remains will be shipped with the remains.

Section 7B—Identification Roles and Responsibilities.

     INSTALLATION HONOR GUARD PROGRAM AND CONDUCT OF MILITARY
                          FUNERAL HONORS

Section 8A—General Honor Guard Policy.

8.1. Military Funeral Honors (MFH) Mission. The Honor Guard is an installation
commander program administered by the Honor Guard Management Office. Providing
military funeral honors is the primary mission of the base honor guard program. The Air Force
will ensure that, upon request, a funeral honors detail is provided for all eligible members. Base
honor guards will support protocol and ceremonial functions for military and civilians, time and
resources permitting. The military funeral honors mission takes precedence over ceremonial
functions. The wishes of the family regarding the honors elements that are provided are
paramount.
8.1. (RANDOLPHAFB)
     8.1.1. (Added-RANDOLPHAFB) HQ AETC/CC requests.
     8.1.2. (Added-RANDOLPHAFB) 12 FTW/CC and above requests.
     8.1.3. (Added-RANDOLPHAFB) Changes of Command at group level and above.
8.2. MFH Entitlement. The Air Force will provide funeral honors and a flyover (if the member
is eligible) at the place of final disposition, or at a memorial service. Funeral honors will not be
provided more than once. The Honor Guard OIC or NCOIC, if performing MFH at a memorial
service, must ensure no other honors are going to be provided elsewhere. Eligible personnel are
only entitled to MFH once. Honor Guard OICs must ensure that honors are always furnished to
all that are eligible. Refer to Section 8C, Eligibility and Entitlements.
8.3. Composition of the Funeral Honors Detail Required by Law. The statutory law
stipulates that MFH will consist of two or more persons; this is also cited in DODI 1300.15,
Military Funeral Support. At least two members of the funeral honors detail will be members of
the armed services (other than members in a retired status) at least one of whom shall be a
member of the armed force of which the decedent was a member. The remainder of the detail
may consist of members of the armed forces or members of Veteran’s Service Organizations
(VSOs). Military members shall wear their Ceremonial uniform while serving in the detail.
8.4. MFH Ceremonial Requirements. By statutory law, a MFH detail shall, at a minimum,
include the folding and presentation of the American flag to the decedent’s family and the
playing of Taps. Every effort will be made to provide Taps via a professional bugler. If a
professional bugler is not available, Taps may be provided using the ceremonial bugle, with
permission of the family. If neither capability exists (professional musician or the ceremonial
bugle), a high quality recorded version of Taps may be played, if the family has been advised.
The detail will provide the audio equipment if not otherwise available for use at the cemetery. It
is the Air Force’s policy to provide additional honors elements to certain categories of personnel,
as specified in Section 8C, Eligibility and Entitlements. Deviation from the standard honors
detail sizes will only be authorized when it is deemed to be mission essential. Providing the
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                      85


minimum funeral honors detail for active duty personnel is not authorized unless the member
died under circumstances cited in paragraph 8.8, Authorized Reduction of Funeral Honors.
8.5. Waiver of Funeral Honors. The requirement to provide honors may be waived by the
Secretary of Defense (this can be delegated to the Secretary of the Air Force) if they consider it
necessary due to requirements of war, national emergency or a contingency operation or other
military requirements. No other person or office may waive this requirement.
8.6. Unsupported Funeral Honors Requests. If an Air Force base honor guard cannot support
a detail, they should contact other agencies for support. They should be contacted in the
following order: Local Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve Units, other Air Force local
base honor guards, other DOD Services who can perform MFH (i.e., Army, Navy, Marine
Corps) and their MAJCOM/A1S office to ensure the requested is supported. An AF Form 1946,
Honor Guard Checklist must be completed indicating the circumstances and justification for the
inability to support the request and submitted to MAJCOM/A1S and HQ AFSVA/SVOM within
five workdays. This information must also be recorded in the Funeral Honors Data Base
(FHDB), https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/fhdb/owa/fhdb_main.login, within 30 days.
8.7. Denial of Military Funeral Honors. Military funeral honors support of any kind shall be
withheld for any of the following, Reference (k):
   8.7.1. A person who has been convicted of a Federal capital crime and whose conviction is
   final (other than a person whose sentence was commuted by the President).
   8.7.2. A person who has been convicted of a State capital crime and whose conviction is
   final (other than a person whose sentence was commuted by a Governor of a state).
   8.7.3. A person who is found to have committed a Federal capital crime or a State capital
   crime, but has not been convicted of such crime by reason of such person not being available
   for trial due to death or flight to avoid prosecution.
   8.7.4. A person who is a veteran, or who died while on active duty or as a member of a
   Reserve component, when the circumstances surrounding the person’s death are such that to
   provide honors at the funeral or burial of the person would bring discredit upon the person’s
   Service (or former Service). If the AF denies military funeral honors based on this provision,
   the following actions are required:
       8.7.4.1. The decision to deny funeral honors rests with the Secretary of the Military
       Department concerned or their designee responsible for funeral honors within each
       Military Service at the flag rank or Senior Executive Service level.
       8.7.4.2. The requesting family member of the deceased veteran or deceased active duty
       member will be provided a written explanation detailing the decision to deny honors.
       8.7.4.3. A copy of the funeral honors denial letter issued by the Military Service will be
       forwarded to the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and
       Readiness (PDUSD(P&R), Attention: Military Funeral Honors.
8.8. Annual Report to Congress. Each calendar year, the Air Force along with the other
Services, must submit funeral honors data for inclusion in an annual report to Congress
prescribed by law. For the Air Force to meet this requirement, it is imperative that each base
honor guard team provides HQ USAF/A1SO data on the number and cost of MFH supported for
their installation, in a timely manner. During the year this information must be entered into
86                                     AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


Funeral Honors Database (FHDB) no later than 30 days from the date of the detail. Timely entry
provides higher headquarters with information they need to respond to high level inquires on
funeral honors. It must be entered into the system no later than 15 days after the end of the
calendar year, so HQ USAF/A1SO can meet their suspense date for the Air Force’s submission
to the Congressional report.
8.9. Responding to Funeral Honors Requests.
     8.9.1. Areas of Responsibility (AORs). Each installation will be responsible for providing
     requested    MFH      support     within    the      base’s     AOR,      identified    at:
     https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-DP-AE-12.
     8.9.2. Communicating With Funeral Director in their AOR (Program Outreach). Honor
     guard personnel should educate funeral directors in their AOR of the MFH request process.
     Funeral directors must be made aware that:
        8.9.2.1. They should contact the base directly or use the toll free number at 1-877-MIL-
        HONR/1-877-645-4667 to request honors. Families should not call the bases directly.
        8.9.2.2. Requests should typically be made as soon as possible, to prepare for the detail,
        with a minimum lead-time of 48 hours. A base honor guard unit will make every effort to
        prevent non-support of the request.
        8.9.2.3. There is a MFH website located at http://www.militaryfuneralhonors.osd.mil
        for their use as well as the source for the most recent MFH Directory.
     8.9.3. Funeral Honors Request Outside the AOR. If the burial place is not within an
     installation’s AOR, the mortuary officer is responsible for arranging disposition and will call
     the mortuary officer at the installation providing honors and notify them of the requirement.
     The phone call will be followed-up with a Defense Messaging System, (DMS) tasking
     message or delivery-confirmed e-mail. When a military member dies overseas and the
     remains are returned to CONUS for burial, HQ AFSVA/SVOM will notify the responsible
     installation of the requirement to provide honors.
     8.9.4. Funeral Honors Requests Overseas. Even though US law does not govern overseas
     locations outside the US and its territories, AF honor guard units overseas should attempt to
     respond to all requests for honors that do not impact the mission.
     8.9.5. Communications Capabilities. Bases must be set up to receive funeral honors requests
     24 hours a day, seven days a week. Funeral directors must be contacted as soon as possible,
     but not more than eight hours after the request came in. Bases are highly encouraged to have
     an individual answer the phone, especially after duty hours, instead of having the calls go
     into voicemail. An on-call Honor Guard representative letter should be filed with the base
     command post. This will prevent loss of time to adequately schedule, task and prepare the
     team especially for short notice requests.

Section 8D—-Base Honor Guard Team Elements.

8.33. Honor Guard/OIC and the Honor Guard/NCOIC.
8.34. Flight NCOIC. The Flight NCOIC heads each honor guard flight, selects the honor guard
members for the color guard, firing party, pallbearer elements and flag-folding teams and assists
the HG/NCOIC.
8.35. Pallbearers. Will be proficient in dignified casket carrying maneuvers. If the deceased
was a member of a local military organization such as the ANG or Air Force Reserve, the family
may opt to select honorary pallbearers from that organization.
8.36. Honorary Pallbearers. Honorary pallbearers (may be either military or civilian) and are
included in retiree and active-duty funeral ceremony but only at the specific request and
invitation of the family.
8.37. Firing Party. The firing party should consist of eight airmen, seven armed with the M14
rifle and the NCOIC of the firing party (NFP). Honor Guard members will not be part of the
firing party if they have been disqualified from bearing arms because of administrative or
judicial action IAW AFI 31-207, Arming & Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, paragraph
2.6.10-10.2, or have failed to qualify in pre-marksmanship training.
   8.37.1. Firing party should qualify in pre-marksmanship training and will be trained on

   into the folded flag.
8.38. Bugler. If a bugler is not available, one may be obtained from other authorized providers
or hired locally and paid by citing O&M funds. When a professional bugler is not available,
advise the family and offer to use the ceremonial bugle or a quality audio system to play Taps. If
the family rejects this offer, then Taps will not be played. When used, audio equipment must be
out of sight of the funeral party. Honor Guard members utilizing the ceremonial bugle must first
be trained IAW Ceremonial Bugle procedures listed in the base honor guard-training manual.
8.39. Color Guard. The color guard will carry the United States Flag and the Air Force
Organizational Flag. The color guard will consist of two fully trained flag bearers and two
guards.
96                                     AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


8.40. Chaplain Support. If requested by the NOK, chaplains will provide military funeral
support when possible. Civilian clergy may be substituted for an Air Force chaplain, at a
family’s request. Families are encouraged to use their own clergy. Chaplain support includes
active duty chaplains assigned to the installation concerned, Air Force Reserve, ANG and retired
chaplains in the immediate area. All requests for chaplain support and for the use of military
chapels for funeral services are made through the installation’s Mortuary Affairs office (except
ANC). Installation's senior chaplain resolves any problems with providing support.
8.41. Flag Folding Teams. Flag folding teams must be skilled at folding the flag. The flag
folding sequence performed as part of Air Force Funeral Honors is done in silence in accordance
with our service history, tradition and policy. When the honor guard folds a flag as part of other
ceremonies, i.e., retirement, only the official Air Force script may be read.
8.42. Precision Drill Teams (optional). Precision drill teams are composed of honor guard
members who excel in their primary honor guard duties or demonstrate superior skills in
precision drill formations and display exemplary decorum and bearing. Installations drill teams
must obtain authorization and training from the USAF Honor Guard. Bayonets and ammunition
will not be used.

Section 8E—Flyovers.

8.43. Flyovers at Funeral or Memorial Services.
     8.43.1. The family may only request one flyover. It may be flown at the funeral or memorial
     service. The deceased members in Table 8.1 are eligible recipients. However, even if
     authorized, flyovers may still be limited based on aircrew/aircraft availability, weather
     constraints, funeral location and/or operational commitments. (NOTE 2).
     8.43.2. A flyover may consist of one to four aircraft in an appropriate formation as specified
     in MAJCOM instructions. A missing-man formation will be flown at a memorial service
     when the body has not been recovered. The missing man formation is a four aircraft
     formation with the number three aircraft either missing or performing a pull-up maneuver at
     a specific time in the flight (AFI 11-209, Aerial Events Policy and Procedures).

Table 8.1. Flyover Eligibility Criteria.

  1.    Active duty and ARC rated officers and non-rated career aviators (13BX officers and 1AXXX
        enlisted crewmembers, i.e., flight engineers, loadmasters, boom operators etc.). The rated
        category includes taking courses of instruction leading to such an aeronautical rating. The ARC
        will be treated the same as active duty (eligible when the death occurs on or off duty). This
        includes ARC members not on unit training assembly (UTA) or military orders

        Table 8.1 Continued

  2.    Non-career aviators (nurses, medical technicians, intelligence, etc.) but only when they die in the
        line of duty while performing aviation duties

  3.    Dignitaries of the Armed Forces and Federal government
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                        97



  4.   Active duty and retired Air Force 3 and 4-star general officers, regardless of aeronautical rating

  5.   Active duty or retired USAF members who have been awarded the Congressional Medal of
       Honor or the Air Force Cross

  6.   Active duty or retired USAF aviators who have achieved one or more officially recognized aerial
       victories (Aces)

  7.   Active duty or retired Chief Master Sergeants of the Air Force (CMSAF)

  8.   USAF members (active duty, retired, or honorably separated) who were Prisoners of War

NOTE 1. Repatriated remains of individuals meeting the requirements of paragraphs 1and 2 above are
entitled to flyover honors if their deaths occurred while serving on active duty.

NOTE 2. In unique cases when a funeral flyover is authorized IAW this instruction, AF/A3O retains
authority to disapprove support if the circumstances of the death and subsequent flyover could reflect
negatively upon the Air Force. Although a funeral or memorial flyover may be authorized, by meeting
the above criteria, it may not always be appropriate. A funeral or memorial flyover is part of the
honors bestowed on the deceased. If the lifestyle of an individual following his or her military service
is not within the standards normally expected of a military professional or if the circumstances
surrounding the death reflect negatively on the Air Force, a funeral flyover may not be approved in all
cases. AF/A3O will make the approval/disapproval decision for flyovers that fall within this category.
8.44. Approval for Flyovers on Military Installations. MAJCOMs may approve on-base
flyovers (may be delegated to Wing). Procedures and approval levels are the same for memorial
services as for funerals when flown in lieu of a funeral/interment ceremony. Memorial flyovers
commemorate or recognize a deceased individual. MAJCOMs may also authorize an additional
flyover at the base to which the individual was assigned (when flown for a Wing initiated
memorial service). To request approval authority for a flyover on a military installation, the
mortuary officer of the installation being overflown will submit a flyover request to the
MAJCOM. The request will be approved by the MAJCOM or designee having operational
control of the aircraft, with the concurrence of the commander responsible for the military
installation to be overflown. If this flyover is for an installation hosted memorial service and the
NOK also requests a flyover for the funeral service at final destination, an exception to policy
approved by the HQ USAF/CV for an installation memorial service flyover will not be required.
Notification to HQ USAF/A3OO (Aerial Events Branch), DSN 222-0856 or COMM 703-692-
0856, will be made prior to the performance of the installation-hosted flyover.
8.45. Approval for Flyovers Off Base. MAJCOM/A3 is the participation authority for flyovers
off base.
   8.45.1. The Mortuary officer responsible for performing honors will submit the request for
   an off-base flyover to their MAJCOM/A1S. MAJCOM/A1S will contact MAJCOM/A3 and
   request telephonic approval for the flyover. If MAJCOM/A3 approves, requesting
   MAJCOM/A1S will immediately contact the appropriate mortuary officer at base level with
   coordination/approval status.
98                                     AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


     8.45.2. MAJCOM/A3 will locate and identify the resource for the flyover. If the resource is
     under the direction of another MAJCOM, the two MAJCOM/A3 offices will coordinate the
     resource(s).
     8.45.3. Once the assets are identified, the MAJCOM/A1S will pass the information to the
     mortuary officer designated to provide the military honors. The mortuary officer will
     coordinate the date, time and place of the service with the flying organization providing the
     resources(s).
     8.45.4. MAJCOM/A1S will immediately follow-up with a confirming e-mail to HQ
     USAF/A3OO, HQ AFSVA/SVOM, the MAJCOM and unit that are providing military
     honors.
8.46. Approval for Flyovers in Washington DC. Flyovers in the Washington DC area are
limited but may be approved with certain restrictions. HQ USAF Aerial Events Coordinator will
take necessary action to obtain an aerial control team for the ceremony, coordinating with HQ
ACC/A3TA (DSN 574-7854). The Washington DC area includes the District of Columbia; the
City of Alexandria, Virginia; the Counties of Arlington and Fairfax, Virginia; the Counties of
Montgomery and Prince Georges, Maryland; together with incorporated municipalities lying
within their borders.
8.47. Request for Waiver to Flyover Policy. HQ USAF/A3O is the approval authority for
requests to waive flyover policy. Waiver requests must first be submitted to MAJCOM/A3.
Determination for flyovers of dignitaries of the armed forces and the Federal government is
delegated to HQ USAF/A3O.

Section 8F—Resource Management.

8.48. Sources of Funeral Honors Manpower. Performance of military funeral honors is a total
force mission. Active-duty personnel, Reserve/National Guard, and military retirees qualified by
active or Reserve units honor guard personnel may also perform this mission. The AP 3,
http://www.mfhcmdrs.osd.mil/, provides another source of personnel to support the honors
mission. However, every effort should be made to obtain volunteers for the honor guard program
from active host and tenant organizations. If there are insufficient volunteers to support the
installation honor guard program, an organizational quota system will be required.
     8.48.1. ARC Augmentation. The active duty installation responsible for military honors, will
     determine honor guard manpower requirements based on historical data collected from the
     AF Form 1946 and data in the FHDB for their AOR. If there are not enough volunteers and
     the quota system does not provide the required number of personnel to meet requirements,
     then ARC augmentation may be needed to support the requirement. The process and
     responsibilities   for     obtaining     ARC        augmentation       are     listed     at
     https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-DP-AE-12.                   Further
     manpower information requests should be staffed to the MAJCOM/A1SO office.
     8.48.2. Authorized Provider Partnership Program (AP3). It allows the Services to provide
     more than the two-person detail to fold and present the flag and play Taps. Authorized
     providers include members of veterans’ service organizations (VSOs), retirees, Reserve
     Officer Training Corps (ROTC) members, members of State Military Funeral Honors
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                        99


   organizations and other organizations authorized to participate in MFH. The AP3 website at
   http://www.mfhcmdrs.osd.mil/ provides extensive information on the AP3 program.
       8.48.2.1. Reimbursement. AP3 volunteers may be reimbursed for their expenses with the
       daily stipend. This stipend has been annually designated by the Secretary of Defense to
       defray the costs for transportation and other expenses incurred by the participant in
       connection with participation in the funeral honors detail. Refer to the Services Agency
       website, https://www-r.afsv.af.mil/MA. for the current memo and stipend rate.
       Reimbursement for expenses for AP3 members will come from the base honor guard’s
       O&M account. Base honor guard units should forecast this requirement for funding.
   8.48.3. Additional elements the AP3 may provide. AP3 can be a source of personnel for a
   firing detail, pallbearers, a bugler, and a color guard and may participate in the folding of the
   flag in veteran funeral details. However, authorized providers cannot be a substitute for the
   legislated minimum, two-person uniformed member detail one of which must be from the
   deceased member’s branch of service to present the flag.
   8.48.4. Full-time honor guard manpower authorizations. Authorized full-time honor guard
   manpower authorizations may be funded through the MAJCOM POM/budget process, based
   on full-time honor guard workload and the 8G Special Duty Identifier (SDI). Funded
   positions are coded under special duty identifier 8G000. Bases have an option of converting
   current funded manpower authorizations into the 8G SDI for a three-year period. After their
   three-year period, the member will return to their unit. Please consult with your base Military
   Personnel Flight (MPF) or see AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and
   Enlisted), 8G SDI, for further instruction.
8.49. Funding. Authorized funeral honors expenditures are supported with O&M funds. The
active duty unit will budget for and provide funds for their own honors program, the ARC and
the Authorized Providers who support them. Reimbursable expenses include:
   8.49.1. Travel and per diem. NOTE: Team members will be placed on appropriate travel
   orders when funeral honors involve TDY. Confirmatory orders will be issued if a member is
   required to perform this special duty.
   8.49.2. Supplies, equipment, weapons and ammunition.
   8.49.3. Procurement and cleaning of uniforms. NOTE: ARC units fund their uniforms and if
   not located near an active duty installation, the ARC unit will fund uniform cleaning.
   8.49.4. Miscellaneous expenses such as hiring a bugler.
   8.49.5. For authorized providers, the MFH stipend will be used for reimbursement. Standard
   Form 1164, Claim for Reimbusement for Expenditures on Official Business should be used to
   request reimbursement. The active duty unit supported will be responsible for processing and
   payment of claims. NOTE: Occasionally authorized partners may participate in a MFH
   detail that requires TDY travel and/or per diem allowance. Invitational travel orders may be
   issued for the partner for reimbursement of fares or POC mileage, as well as actual cost of
   lodging and meals up to the per diem rate.
8.50. Base Honor Guard Uniforms. The USAF Honor Guard establishes base level honor
guard uniform standards. Honor guard uniforms must be worn and maintained IAW AFI 36-
2903, Table 3.2. Deviations are not authorized without approval from the USAF Honor Guard.

8.51. Honor Guard Weapons and Ammunition Acquisition. MFH firing parties will use the
M-14 rifle. Note: Use of the M1 is no longer authorized.
   8.51.1. The M-14 rifle (operational - NSN 1005-01-494-4169GG) and M-1 rifle (inert - NSN
   1005-00-599-3289) are available for issue. Refer to additional M-14 national stock numbers
   located:     https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-DP-AE-12.
   Funded requisitions will be submitted through base supply and the MAJCOM/A1S to HQ
   USAF/A1SO to WR-ALC/LKJMW, Routing Identifier FLB, Robins AFB GA, 31098-5000.
   8.51.2. Blank 7.62mm ammunition will be used for MFH and memorial services drill team
   presentations and honor guard and drill team practice. The honor guard will submit
   projections for blank ammunition needed to MAJCOM/A1S, annually. MAJCOM/A1S will
   include these requirements in the installation’s five-year forecast. Active duty honor guards
   will forecast and fund ammunition for ARC augmentation.
8.52. Weapons Handling. Weapons will be handled IAW AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons
Handling Manual. If any person must be armed with an operational weapon to protect guard
weapons, they must meet the requirements set forth in AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by

   Pubs,         www.logsa.army.mil.
8.55. Presenting Spent Rounds to the Family. The detail OIC or NCOIC may provide three
spent rounds to the family. However, the NCOIC of the firing party must inspect all fired
ammunition to secure any rounds provided to the family are in fact spent and not live rounds.
Spent rounds should never be placed in the folded flag.
8.56. Honor Guard Vehicles. Honor Guard vehicle requirements are found in Allowance
Standard (AS) 019, Mission Application, ―ZF‖. Vehicle support may be obtained from the
transportation squadron if vehicle allowance and authorization has not been established. When
special vehicles, such as buses or tractor-trailers are needed, the installation transportation
organization will provide qualified drivers. If the basis of issue does not meet honor guard
requirements (demand for funeral honors is at a level that exceeds vehicles assigned) and
temporary dispatch vehicle will not suffice, the Services Commander/Division Chief may require
an increase in their authorization. See AFI 34-204, Property Management, for additional
guidance on vehicles.
   8.56.1. Establishing Vehicle Authorizations. Bases will use allowance source code AS
   019ZF to add or increase vehicle authorization for their honor guard requirements. These
   allowance standards are source documents only and do not constitute authorization or
   approval authority for vehicles. To obtain specific vehicle authorizations, bases must submit
   requirements through Transportation channels to MAJCOMs IAW AFI 24-301, Vehicle
   Operations. When establishing these requirements, Services Commander/Division Chief is
   encouraged to seek the specific support of the wing commander.
   8.56.2. Use of MAJCOM Allowance Standards. In lieu of AS019ZF, bases may elect to
   establish their requirements under the MAJCOM allowance standards, 020 through 032.

   9.16.1. For Air Force activities in CONUS the mortuary officer will arrange for contract
   mortuary services through the contracting officer IAW the Defense Federal Acquisition
   Regulation Supplement (DFARS) subpart 237.70, (48 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR)
   237.7000-7004). Contract mortuary services may be provided via an annual contract, a
   contract awarded to another installation (Air Force, Army or Navy) or by purchase order for
   individual cases.
   9.16.2. Every two years, HQ AFSVA will furnish each Air Force activity with a copy of the
   Directory of Funeral Directors as a resource for locating funeral homes in vicinity of the
   base. This publication includes the correct name, address and phone number of CONUS

9.18. One Time Purchase Order. If an annual contract is not in effect at the place of death, a
purchase order will be cut to handle the individual case. If the contracting officer or authorized
representative cannot immediately go to the place where death occurred, he or she must
telephone (contact) a funeral director at or near the place of death and make interim
arrangements for mortuary services under this provision. However, the contracting officer should
exercise caution to ensure that the necessary services are obtained at a fair and reasonable cost.

remains are then moved to a contract funeral home for reprocessing, dressing, casketing and
shipment or delivery to final destination, the mortuary officer who handles disposition of the
remains will advise the non-contract funeral home to submit a claim for services rendered. The
claim, if reasonable, is paid by that activity. When you cannot determine the amount due the
claimant, the claim will be forwarded to HQ AFSVA/SVOM Affairs for review and payment
recommendation.

Section 9E—Payment of Mortuary Supplies and Services.

9.20. Use of the Government Purchase Card (GPC). GPC will be used to pay for mortuary
supplies, equipment and non-personal services under the micro purchase threshold (currently
$3,000.00) whenever possible. When there is a mortuary services contract in effect, with a pre-

Government-wide Purchase Card Program paragraph 2.1.2.3).
   9.20.1. Each installation will establish a mortuary GPC account through their MAJCOM or
   base and coordinate with the base budget office. GPC account is authorized for government
   to vendor purchases for primary expenses, transportation of remains, accoutrements and
   clothing. It is prohibited to use the GPC to pay for secondary funeral expenses, flowers,
   memorial folders and dry cleaning (personal property).
   9.20.2. Use of the GPC implies accepted financial pecuniary liability by the user. GPC user
   will ensure regulatory specifications (PWS) are met (i.e., for caskets, urns and preparation)
   before payment is made. Payment should be withheld for deficiencies.

   will verify the death, assign an authorization number and send an authorization letter
   describing the entitlements specific to each case. Once purchases are complete, mortuary
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                    109


   affairs personnel will fax all GPC expenses to HQ AFSVA/SVOM along with the
   finalized/completed cost data worksheets. If HQ AFSVA/SVOM authorized the use of its
   GPC, receipts will be faxed immediately after the purchase. The mortuary officer will ensure
   correct fund citation and ESP coding for reimbursement by your MAJCOM for authorized
   expenses.
   9.21.2. Secondary and Transportation Expenses. Authorized secondary and transportation of
   remains expenses will be paid upon receipt of the signed DD Form 1375 and funeral home
   invoices by submitting a completed SF 1034 through your local finance office.

installation or mortuary arranging for care and disposition of the remains will accomplish DD
Form 2065 and obtain supplies and transportation. He or she will coordinate with the mortuary
where the remains are prepared to determine the proper amount of reimbursement to collect.
Item 14 of DD Form 2065 will be completed with the appropriate Air Force funding
classification. (NOTE: The charge for mortuary and embalming supplies at a Government
mortuary facility is $9.00 for cases not requiring a blanket and polyethylene sheeting. If a
blanket and polyethylene sheeting is required, the charge for mortuary and embalming supplies is
$23.00 dollars).
   9.22.1. Cash, cashiers’ checks, bank drafts, certified checks and personal checks are
   acceptable types of payment for mortuary services and supplies. Personal checks will be
   annotated with the printed name, grade and organization or home address of the writer.
   9.22.2. In some instances, there is no sponsor or PADD in the area to complete DD Form
   2065. For example, a sponsor or PADD and his or her dependent are killed in a common
   accident or disaster, or the sponsor or PADD is not in the same geographical area where the
   dependent died. Make every effort locally to obtain reimbursement even though a DD Form
   2065 cannot be accomplished. Promptly advise HQ AFSVA/SVOM of a case that cannot be
   resolved locally. Do not hold remains outside CONUS pending resolution of reimbursement
   problems.
9.23. Depositing Proceeds from Reimbursement. Reimbursements collected for cost of
mortuary services and supplies will be immediately deposited with the servicing Accounting and
Finance Office (AFO).
   9.23.1. The DD Form 1131 will be used to credit the appropriation and project under which
   these costs were financed (i.e., D059 for port costs, D046 for transportation, etc). A copy of
   this form will be sent with the remains to Dover Port Mortuary.
   9.23.2. When the sponsor or PADD elects the port to furnish services and supplies, Dover
   Port Mortuary charges will be deposited to the credit of the port mortuary account through
   AMC in the same manner.
9.24. Establishing Accounting Procedures. The mortuary officer will establish accounts
receivable files, implement methods of requesting payment and process delinquent accounts as
prescribed in DFAS-DER 177-102. Generally, the retained copy of DD Form 2065 constitutes
the basis for an accounts receivable file. AF Form 819, Invoice/Claim, is used as a billing
document by the Air Force and is used to request reimbursement for mortuary services.
However, a form is very impersonal, so a transit letter should accompany the AF Form 819.
Attach a copy of the reimbursement request document to DD Form 2065 in the file. Three

requests for payment are made at 30-day intervals with the second and third request sent certified
mail, return-receipt requested. Accounts not paid within 90 days of the original billing are sent to
the servicing AFO according to DFAS-DER 177.2R. Should any questions arise, the local
operating location (OPLOC) should be contacted.

Section 11A—General Mass Fatality Policy

11.1. Purpose. This chapter assigns responsibilities and prescribes policy responding to Mass
Fatality Incidents (MFI). AMCMAN 34-501, Mass Fatality Management provides additional
guidance on the MFI process.
11.2. MFI Defined. A Mass Fatality Incident (MFI) is the occurrence of multiple deaths,
normally five or more.
   11.2.1. Mass fatality incidents can easily cross military service boundaries and involve
   military, dependents, Department of Defense (DOD) civilians, US civilians, and/or foreign

Section 11D—Disposition of Personal Effects.

11.14. Handling and Disposition of Personal Effects (PE). PE of the deceased in a mass
fatality incident will be recovered, identified, and disposed of per AFI 34-244. The volume of
and commingling of PE in a mass fatality incident makes collection and determination of
ownership more time consuming and difficult than in a case of individual death. This is done
concurrent with the recovery, identification, and disposition of the remains from the incident.
Disposition of PE for each deceased can require actions at multiple locations in addition to the
MFI site. For instance, PE located at a deceased military person’s home station (when the family
does not reside there), temporary duty location, or other places under military jurisdiction must
be collected, inventoried, and transferred to the PERE. Incidents involving large numbers of
deceased may require the mortuary affairs executive agent to establish a PE depot. In this case
each service with deaths will provide members to the PE depot to act on behalf of their service
decedents.
   11.14.1. Security of PE will be ensured from initial recovery to final disposition. A secure
   work area is needed for sorting property (hangar, fitness center, etc.) and secure storage is
   mandatory (vans, lockers, safes, etc.) particularly for high value items such as computers,
   electronics, cameras, and jewelry.
   11.14.2. A SCO will be appointed for each deceased military member, usually from
   personnel assigned to the member’s home station. The SCO is responsible for collecting,
   securing, inventorying, and disposing of personal property of the deceased that is under
   military jurisdiction.
   11.14.3. PE Retained as Evidence. PE may be retained as evidence by civil and/or military
   law enforcement or investigative authorities until no longer needed.
       11.14.3.1. Civil Agencies. Civil law enforcement and investigative agencies have their
       own policies and procedures for disposing of evidence, including PE. The SCO should
       advise the PERE that queries concerning PE held by nonmilitary agencies should be sent
       to each applicable agency. The SCO will provide the PERE with the agency’s physical
       evidence custodian’s name, mailing address, and telephone number.
120                                    AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


       11.14.3.2. Military Agencies. The SCO will contact the physical evidence custodian of
       the military law enforcement or investigative agency and advise the custodian when PE is
       released as evidence, the PE will be turned over to the SCO for disposition as prescribed
       by Federal statute and Air Force instructions.
       11.14.3.3. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI), or Security Forces
       Investigations (SFOI) may return the property directly to the authorized recipient rather
       than the SCO.

Section 11E—Mass Fatality Plans

11.15. Mass Fatality Plans – Required Elements. Installation mass fatality plans will include
the following elements:
   11.15.1. Establishment of command and control. This includes procedures for activating a
   unit control center and identifying organizations and personnel to notify in the event of a
   mass fatality.
   11.15.2. Situation Assessment. Situation assessment considerations should include location
   of the incident, type of incident, number of personnel involved, who has jurisdiction over the
   remains, whether MOUs or agreements with local authorities are in place or are required. For
   incidents that occur OCONUS, Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) or other local
   agreements may govern how operations are conducted.
   11.15.3. Identifying Operating Locations or Facilities. Consider the following phases when
   identifying locations in the plan, keeping in mind that all phases might be handled in a single
   location:
       11.15.3.1. Decontamination, if required.
       11.15.3.2. Identification.
       11.15.3.3. Processing.
       11.15.3.4. Preparation location site – initial and reprocessing, if required.
       11.15.3.5. Handling PE. NOTE: If it’s a joint operation, the Army (the executive agent)
       will establish or assist with a PE depot.
   11.15.4. Communications Requirements. Identify possible communications needed to
   communicate between and among the various agencies and headquarters, as required. (Cell
   phones, telephones, HF/UHF/VHF radios, handheld portable radios, fax machines with
   secure transmission capability, etc).
   11.15.5. Records Collection Procedures. Refer to Chapter 7 for identification records and
   Chapter 3 for personal information.
   11.15.6. Required Supplies and Equipment. Determine what’s needed for the operating
   locations and for S&R operations. (For S&R supplies, see Chapter 6). Identify procedures
   and resources for procuring emergency supplies and equipment quickly.

   Chapter 6.
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                121


  11.15.8. Identification of Remains. Ensure ID facility, security procedures and sources of
  refrigerated storage are identified. Refer to Chapter 7 for identification policy.
  11.15.9. Preparation of Remains. Include procedures for preparing multiple remains in the
  local area. Identify additional funeral homes and procedures needed to request single use
  contracts.
  11.15.10. Disposition. Develop procedures for handling more than five decedents, to
  include:
     11.15.10.1. Obtaining disposition instructions in a mass fatality scenario.
     11.15.10.2. Determining authorized entitlements.
     11.15.10.3. Arranging honors (if authorized and requested).
     11.15.10.4. Shipping remains and arranging funeral travel for eligible relatives.
     11.15.10.5. Arranging for an escort (for active duty decedents).
     11.15.10.6. Ensuring FLOs are appointed.
     11.15.10.7. Arranging for SCOs to handle disposition of personal property and effects
     (AFI 34-244).
     11.15.10.8. Records handling – forms, multiple mortuary case files.
  11.15.11. Demobilization. When the mass fatality mission has been completed and all
  deceased personnel have been identified, processed and returned to the PADD for interment,
  the operation can begin demobilization.
     11.15.11.1. All rented or borrowed equipment at the processing and preparation location
     will be returned to its owning agency/unit.
     11.15.11.2. All personnel involved in the mass fatality operation will receive a CISM

                                          Chapter 12

               MORTUARY AFFAIRS IN CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS

Section 12A—General Policy.

12.1. Purpose. This chapter provides policy for mortuary affairs in contingency operations and
the prescribed processes for Mortuary Affairs Collection Points (MACP), temporary storage or
interment and handling contaminated remains. This policy is derived from JP 4-06, Joint Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures for Mortuary Affairs in Joint Operations. Mortuary operations in a
contingency environment will be subject to host nation agreements and executed IAW the
American, British, Canadian, and Australian (ABCA), QSTAG 655, ―Handling Deceased,
Personnel in a Theater of Operations,‖ and NATO STANAG 2070, ―Emergency War Burial
Procedures,‖ where applicable. Mortuary affairs support may also be required to support any
unexpected CONUS contingency operations.
12.2. Overview. The goal of the mortuary affairs program during contingency operations is to
ensure remains are returned to CONUS as quickly as possible to preserve remains for
identification and preservation of evidence of death. All contingency operating locations will
operate under the Current Death Program during regional contingencies until such time the
mortuary affairs executive agent declares implementation of the Concurrent Return Program
defined in paragraph 1.2.2 If it is not possible to return remains in a timely manner, the theater
commander may implement temporary refrigerated storage or interment.
   12.2.1. War Mobilization Plan (WMP) 1, Services Supplement, AFH 10-247, Vol 4, and the
   Prime RIBS Home Station Training (HST) and Services Combat Training (SCT) courses
   provide additional guidance on mortuary affairs in a contingency environment.
   12.2.2. Mortuary Equipment. Designated lead teams will deploy with the initial Mortuary
   Kit (LWRRG) to include human remains pouches, mortuary forms, and S&R equipment and
   supplies to support limited S&R operations in the AOR. NOTE: The equipment in the
   LWRRG kit differs from the equipment used at the MACP, which comes from pre-positioned
   War Reserve Materiel (WRM).
12.3. Scope of the Mortuary Program in Contingency Operations. The mortuary affairs
program in a contingency environment will provide support across the full spectrum of military
operations to include:
   12.3.1. S&R, tentative BTB identification, evacuation of remains and when required,
   temporary refrigerated storage or interment, disinterment and return of deceased military,
   civilian and allied personnel, detainees and enemy dead.
       12.3.1.1. All management and lead UTC personnel will be trained                         on
       wartime/contingency S&R procedures (LWRR4, R5, and RA) (paragraph 6.4.5.4).
   12.3.2. Establishment and operation of MACP, theater mortuary evacuation points (TMEPs),
   military mortuaries, and interment sites.
   12.3.3. Collection, inventory, storage, and processing of personal effects of deceased and
   missing US and enemy personnel IAW AFI 34-244, Chapter 5, Wartime Personal Effects
   Office Procedures.
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                     123


   12.3.4. Operation of the Dover Port Mortuary (paragraph 10.2).
   12.3.5. Preparation and coordination of the shipment of remains for final disposition.
   12.3.6. Response to mass fatality incidents (Chapter 11).
12.4. Contingency Mortuary Support - Other Categories of Personnel
   12.4.1. Dependents and US Civilians. Dependents and US civilians accompanying or
   employed by US forces will be processed in a manner similar to US military personnel. All
   records and reports required for military members will be used.
   12.4.2. Allied, Detainees and Enemy Deceased. Existing standardization agreements will be
   used whenever possible. If agreements do not exist and the US is the lead nation, US policy
   should have primacy. If agreements do not exist and another nation is the lead, US policy
   would apply only to US forces and citizens, unless otherwise adopted by the multinational
   force. Under these circumstances the same records and reports will be used as for US
   military. Interment, if required, will be separate for allied, detainees and enemy dead. PE of
   allied personnel will be processed IAW standing agreements or per current mortuary affairs
   procedures if no agreements exist.
   12.4.3. POWs. Processing of POWs will be IAW the Geneva Conventions.
   12.4.4. Transfer to Host Country. When arrangements are made to transfer remains and PE
   to the host country or to an allied nation, mortuary officers will document the transfer in the
   mortuary officer log of events. The mortuary officer will also provide information for all
   enemy, detainees or allied deceased transferred from temporary interment sites for which
   they have responsibility to the Theater Joint Mortuary Affairs Office (JMAO).
12.5. S&R Operations. While the service component with mortuary affairs executive agent
responsibility is the lead for S&R in the theater of operations, bed down locations with Air Force
base operating support (BOS) responsibility may be required to conduct S&R in support of
incidents on/near their installation for minor incidents with two or less casualties. HQ AFSVA/
SVOM will determine whether a FSRT team is required. As a guideline, incidents with three or
more commingled remains will likely require FSRT team. Prior to conducting any S&R
operations, the mortuary officer must contact the Component Headquarters Services staff. The
Component Headquarters staff will coordinate with the mortuary affairs executive agent to
determine who will conduct the S&R. When it has been determined that Air Force personnel will
conduct S&R operations, the following policy applies:
   12.5.1. Services personnel will manage S&R operations and task members of other
   organizations as augmentees.
   12.5.2. S&R may only be conducted under conditions that do not endanger the S&R team.
   Under hostile conditions, installation commanders will determine when it is safe to begin
   S&R operations. Under non-hostile conditions, EOD, CBRNand Security Force personnel
   will determine if/when the area is safe to conduct S&R operations. NOTE: In a contaminated
   environment, FSRTs should limit S&R operations to the minimum processes required to
   remove remains from the field. Personnel must wear the appropriate protective gear required
   for the operation. Treat all remains as contaminated. Consult CE Readiness personnel and
   follow appropriate personal decontamination procedures at the conclusion of S&R
   operations.
124                                  AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


   12.5.3. Units conducting recovery operations in the AOR must take special precautions to
   preserve all items that might be useful in establishing a tentative identification of remains.
   When performing recovery operations, use any means available to cover all remains and
   portions of remains recovered. PE will not be removed from remains at the mishap site. This
   will include official cards (line badge) and papers, nametags, and accouterments. These items
   will be left on/with the remains to preserve identification evidence. Only weapons, ordnance,
   and/or classified material may be removed from the remains. Coordinate with Security
   Force/EOD personnel for removal.
   12.5.4. The mortuary officer will coordinate with Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) to
   determine PPE requirements for S&R.
   12.5.5. The mortuary officer will coordinate with the CE to determine if a GPS capability
   exists to plot remains and personal effects locations.
   12.5.6. If the recovery must be completed expeditiously, due to possible hostilities or unsafe
   conditions, ―R‖ or ―P‖ (remains portions) and ―E‖ (personal effects) numbers will not be
   used. If there is sufficient time, the following ―Tagging and Bagging‖ process will be used.
      12.5.6.1. Each stake will be marked with an ―R‖ or ―P‖number (example, R-1), using
      consecutive recovery numbers for each stake.
      12.5.6.2. If GPS is available the location of each portion of remains and PE will be
      plotted. GPS coordinates will be annotated on both remains/PE tags. If GPS is not
      available, hand drawn maps or sketches will be used to plot the location of remains and
      PE.
      12.5.6.3. Two tags will be used for each remains (or portion thereof) and PE found. GPS
      coordinate must be written on both tags (if no GPS capability--the R or P-number should
      be written on both tags). One tag will be attached to the remains or PE. The second tag
      will be attached to the human remains/PE bag.
      12.5.6.4. The remains will be placed in a human remains pouch or plastic bag. Minimize
      handling to prevent damage. Examine the ground beneath the remains and immediate
      area to assure all portions are recovered.
      12.5.6.5. Place PE found near the remains in a plastic bag and place in the same human
      remains pouch. Place all other PE into a separate human remains pouch.
      12.5.6.6. Personal belongings found loose at the site will be annotated on the site map
      and placed in plastic bags secured with wire tie shipping tags. There should not be any
      attempt to re-associate personal property or accouterments found loose at the mishap site
      until the remains are processed and identified.
      12.5.6.7. Remains must be refrigerated at a temperature of 38 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit
      or 3.3 to 4.4 degrees Centigrade. If refrigeration equipment is not readily available, pack
      bagged remains in ice or ice packs in insulated chests or in a transfer case, depending on
      size of the remains; ice will not be placed directly on remains.
   12.5.7. The FSS commander/OIC should keep the Air Force Component forward staff
   informed of the status of recovery.
   12.5.8. S&R will be terminated upon direction from the on-scene commander.
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                     125


   12.5.9. Remains and PE should be evacuated as soon as possible to the nearest Theater
   Mortuary Evacuation Point (TMEP) for onward movement to a Government mortuary.

Section 12B—Contingency Mortuary Operating Concept (Flow of Remains).

12.6. Casualty Collection Point (CCP). The CCPs are normally located near a medical facility
and managed by medical personnel. A FSS representative will normally coordinate with the CCP
to begin actions to receive the dead.
   12.6.1. At CCP, a competent medical authority is required to declare death. Declaration of
   death should be recorded on appropriate medical form or tag. The word ―draft‖ should be
   placed on the death certificate. During instances where remains arrive directly at the MACP,
   a competent medical authority will be called upon to pronounce death. Physicians in the field
   should provide information on cause of death, if known (e.g., gunshot, blunt trauma). Final
   determination as to positive identification of remains and the cause and manner of death rests
   with the Office of the AFME.
   12.6.2. Remains suspected to have unexploded ordnance (UXOs) must be reported to the CE
   representative in the Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
   12.6.3. While waiting for transportation, mortuary personnel will ensure remains are laid
   shoulder to shoulder and screened to prevent them from public view. Mortuary personnel will
   also coordinate with security forces if needed, to assist in preventing the theft of PE,
   equipment, and to keep unauthorized persons away from the area.
   12.6.4. Transportation will provide FSS mortuary personnel with a covered vehicle to
   transport remains from the CCP to the MACP. Remains will be carried feet first at all times.
   While loading remains, an attitude of reverence and respect will be maintained at all times.
   Remains loaded on vehicles and aircraft will be loaded feet first. Remains will be secured to
   prevent shifting during movement.
12.7. Mortuary Affairs Collection Point (MACP). The MACP’s main purpose is to move
remains, along with accompanying PE, to the Dover AFB Port Mortuary as quickly as possible
for processing and identification (bag, tag, encase and ship).
   12.7.1. Site Selection. MACP should be physically separated from the main living and
   working areas. It should have natural or artificial cover (trees, hills, unused ISO containers)
   and be screened from view. There should be an access road for vehicles. Sufficient space
   must be made for processing and holding areas. A perimeter will be established to prevent
   unauthorized personnel and news media from entering the area. If there is a possibility
   remains may contain UXOs, provide sandbags and revetments for emergency areas of
   protection and for general blast protection.
   12.7.2. Morgue Requirements. Most field mortuary operations use a four-section TEMPER
   tent or Small Shelter System to support MACP operations. The site will also require a 275
   cubic foot refrigerator for remains storage. It may require a power generator if normal site
   power is not available during processing. MACP will also require adequate lighting, a water
   supply, access for truck and forklift operations, good drainage and runoff protection and
   ventilation. Depending upon the location and temperatures, an environmental control unit
   (ECU) may be required during processing. A contaminated waste collection point may also
   be required.
126                                  AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


   12.7.3. MACP Layout. Ideally, the receiving, processing and evacuation sections should be
   established in separate areas to avoid confusion. Refer to JP 04-06, Appendix A for detailed
   information on facility layout.
   12.7.4. MACP Planning for Bio-Defense. Because of the increased terrorist threat of
   biological warfare, planning for the operation of a MACP in a biological environment must
   be considered as part of the Base Bio-Defense Plan. Use of Mission Oriented Protective
   Posture (MOPP 4) equipment meets personnel safety requirements, until specific Bio-
   Defense protective equipment/gear has been developed and fielded.
12.8. Mortuary Personnel MACP Responsibilities. Mortuary personnel will collect and
preserve identification information, operate the MACP, and prepare the remains for shipment.
Recovery of remains to either CCP or MACP should be accomplished through the medical
evacuation system or the ―Buddy Care‖ system. If remains are delivered to the CCP instead of
the MACP, it is the responsibility of the MACP or the mortuary CCP augmentees to collect
remains from the CCP and transport them to the MACP.
12.9. The MACP Process. Personnel at MACP will accomplish the tasks in paragraphs 12.9.1
through 12.9.13 However, if an aircraft is departing within two hours (or before remains can be
processed), remains will be shipped without processing.
   12.9.1. Verify EOD personnel have checked for unexploded ordnance and other hazardous
   items prior to entering the receiving area.
   12.9.2. Record required information on the DD Form 1077, Collection Point Register of
   Deceased Personnel and confirm the actual number of remains being delivered. The DD
   Form 1077 is a daily log of all remains the MACP receives. A new DD Form 1077 will be
   prepared each day the MACP is in operation.
   12.9.3. Leave clothing, personal effects, and gear (i.e., helmets, vests, safety equipment, or
   organizational equipment) on the remains to aid in identification and investigation at the port
   mortuary (including the chemical warfare defense ensemble). All items on the remains,
   except weapons, munitions, classified documents, and hazardous material, are to be shipped
   with the remains; do not wash remains.
   12.9.4. Armed personnel who become casualties should be relieved of their weapons,
   ammunition, and munitions by personnel from their unit prior to arrival at CCP or MACP if
   safe to do so. Unit members should return these items to the unit armory, aircrew life support
   section, or appropriate storage area. If mortuary personnel discover weapons or ammunition,
   ensure they are secured IAW 31-101, AF Installation Security Program and the unit of the
   deceased responds as soon as possible to account for the weapons. Always notify EOD
   personnel or the EOC if unexploded ordnance is discovered during remains processing.
   12.9.5. Complete two tags for every HRP. On one side of the evacuation tag include the
   remains BTB last name, first name, initial, SSN or ―unidentified‖. On the reverse side,
   include the evacuation number (a sequential number given to each remains during the current
   calendar year), MACP branch of service, the MACP unit and number, and the seal number
   that will be used to seal the HRP.
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                     127


      12.9.5.1. If remains are fragmented record the word ―Portions‖; beneath ―Portions‖,
      write the sequential number of portions ―1 of ___‖. The reverse side is completed the
      same as for remains in paragraph 12.9.5
   12.9.6. Record the evacuation number, date remains were received, the ―BTB‖name and
   SSN, if available, (or identified) on the reverse side of the DD Form 1077.
   12.9.7. Place unwashed remains in HRP. Use separate pouches for each fragment and do not
   commingle fragmented remains unless they were received commingled, or confirmed to be
   one decedent. NOTE: Do not fingerprint or perform dental charting in a field environment as
   it may cause loss of forensic evidence. Dental charting and fingerprinting will be performed
   at the Dover Port Mortuary.
   12.9.8. Attach one tag to the remains and one tag to the remains pouch. When placing
   several fragmented remains, each portion must be tagged. HRP must also have an evacuation
   tag on which the words ―Portions‖ is written and beneath it the total number of portions
   contained in the HRP. The reverse side is completed as in paragraph 12.9.5
   12.9.9. Place the plastic pouch with the death certificate and other pertinent information into
   the remains pouch. Close and secure the remains pouch with a plastic fastener.
   12.9.10. Coordinate with Security Forces if assistance is required to guard remains until they
   are shipped to either a TMEP, OCONUS mortuary or Dover Port Mortuary.
   12.9.11. When remains are ready to be shipped, place them into a transfer case and put ice
   around the pouch. Ensure the ice does not come in direct contact with the remains. The
   transfer cases will not be draped with a flag from the AOR to the port mortuary (this will
   avoid draping a transfer case of coalition or enemy dead with an American flag).
   12.9.12. Record the shipment information (date, shipped to) on DD Form 1077. Also record
   the shipment on DD Form 1075, Convoy List of Remains of Deceased Personnel. The aircraft
   commander or vehicle driver must sign for the remains on DD Form 1075.
   12.9.13. At the end of each day, the Services Control Center will provide higher
   headquarters with a SITREP of the day’s mortuary affairs activity. Record all evacuation
   numbers received and shipped on the report. Continue reporting these numbers on future
   SITREPs until notification of the remains have arrived at the Dover Port Mortuary. Continue
   reporting during emergency conditions, delayed precedence. Submit data requirements as
   prescribed, but they may be delayed to allow the submission of higher precedence reports.
12.10. Theater Mortuary Evacuation Points (TMEPs). TMEPs are established to evacuate
all remains and accompanying PE to a government mortuary. Personnel at the TMEP will:
   12.10.1. Receive remains (and accompanying PE, clothing and gear) from any theater
   location and record them on the DD Form 1077.
   12.10.2. Perform quality assurance checks on existing documentation and/or initiate
   complete and obtain required processing documentation.
   12.10.3. Prepare remains for evacuation and/or ice the remains, when practical until
   transportation can be arranged. NOTE: Do not wash the remains, clean the fingers for
   fingerprinting or fingerprint the remains.
   12.10.4. Arrange airlift and initiate all required shipping and special handling documents.
128                                   AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


   12.10.5. Record the shipment on DD Form 1075.
   12.10.6. Transport transfer cases to the AMC special handling area to be palletized. Transfer
   cases should be tied down with no more than three transfer cases per pallet. Do not stack
   transfer cases on pallets. NOTE: Transfer cases should be loaded onto the aircraft feet first
   and turned once inside the aircraft so the remains are stowed in the aircraft head first towards
   the nose of the aircraft. Ensure the head is higher than the feet. This will normally be
   accomplished by stowing the case on the aircraft or pallet in a level position. No other cargo
   or miscellaneous items besides other human remains may be placed on top of human
   remains. Remains should be offloaded feet first, (AMCI 24-101 V11, Military Airlift – Cargo
   and Mail).
   12.10.7. Document evacuation numbers in the SITREP.
12.11. Aerial Port: (Services Augmentation). NOTE: Remains may flow directly to Dover
AFB Port Mortuary.
   12.11.1. Aerial port will receive remains from the TMEP, record them on DD Form 1077
   and ice remains for shipment if practical.
   12.11.2. Remains will be shipped to Dover AFB Port Mortuary.
   12.11.3. Shipment will be recorded on DD Form 1075 and evacuation numbers will be
   documented in the SITREP.
12.12. Dover Port Mortuary. Port Mortuary specialty teams will receive remains at port
mortuary at Dover AFB. Members will be given port mortuary training for the tasks being
performed at the mortuary. Personnel at Dover AFB Port Mortuary will:
   12.12.1. Receive remains and record them on DD Form 1077.
   12.12.2. Inventory and process PE on DD Form 1076 (NOTE: After AF Form 1122 is
   discontinued).
   12.12.3. Identify remains. (Identification will be accomplished at Dover Port Mortuary by
   the AFME). Only tentative identification BTB information is collected at TMCP.
   12.12.4. Determine the manner and cause of death AFME.
   12.12.5. Prepare and casket the remains, complying with disposition instructions from the
   PADD.
   12.12.6. Identify escorts.
   12.12.7. Ship remains and PE per disposition instructions.

Section 12C—Temporary Storage or Interment in the AOR

12.13. Emergency Interment. Emergency interment is an interment, usually on the battlefield,
when conditions do not permit either evacuation to a MACP or TMEP. Sometimes referred to as
hasty burial, it may occur when intense hostilities prevent evacuation of remains and burial is an
emergency means of preserving remains or preventing them from falling into enemy hands. It
may amount to little more than hiding and recording the location of remains so they can be safely
recovered later. It is the only situation in which temporary interment can occur without theater
commander direction. In such case, the decision to temporarily inter can be made by the senior
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                        129


military member (officer or enlisted) on scene. If so, immediately meet with CE to finalize
layout and begin excavating a temporary interment site. It is imperative to record the location of
the emergency burial so that the remains can be found and disinterred as soon as possible.
12.14. Temporary Interment. Temporary interment is only permitted as a last resort. Every
effort will be made to evacuate remains as soon as possible. Situations that may require
temporary interment include weapons of mass destruction, hostilities, transportation shortages, a
large number of remains that could overwhelm manpower capabilities, insufficient capability to
decontaminate remains or insufficient refrigerator space. Unit commanders must obtain
permission from the geographic combatant commander to conduct temporary interment
operations.
   12.14.1. When circumstances warrant temporary interment, recovery operations will be
   conducted as soon as possible.
   12.14.2. When interment is required separate interment sites should be established for burial
   of allied, detainees and enemy deceased to aid in later disinterment operations. When
   arrangements are made to transfer remains to the host country or to a friendly nation,
   commanders will maintain records of the transfer and provide information for all allied,
   detained or enemy deceased transferred from temporary interment sites for which they have
   responsibility.
12.15. Selection of Temporary Interment Site. The site should be level, free of large
obstacles, away from main roads and populated areas, not in a flood zone and have adequate soil
depth to the water table. CE will determine what equipment is available on station that will be
adequate to the task given types of soil and local conditions. Ensure the layout is site specific and
they do not try using strictly book values for spacing and depth. CE must provide enough space
between rows to prevent equipment from caving in or sliding into the trenches when excavating
and while covering the remains. They may also have to assist Services personnel for placement
of row markers. At established/mature contingency bed downs, the location of temporary burial
sites should be determined in advance. Primary and alternate sites for temporary burial locations
should be clearly identified using grid coordinates. Site selection should be coordinated between
CE and FSS.
   12.15.1. Interment Site Dimensions. Temporary burial sites do not contain individual graves,
   but will consist of straight rows (trenches). The number of remains you have will determine
   how many sites you will need. No more than 10 remains, head to foot lengthwise, will be
   placed in each trench. The rows will be 70 feet long, 3 ½ feet deep and 3 feet wide. For
   contaminated remains, the depth should be 6 1/2 ft and trenches should be 80’ long. A
   distance of 3 feet between trench rows will be maintained. Base CE will provide mechanical
   trenching or other earth moving equipment, with operators. Separate rows will be used for
   US, allied, and enemy dead.
12.16. The Temporary Interment Process. Mortuary personnel will:
   12.16.1. Meet personnel transporting remains and obtain documentation and information on
   the remains. If a list of remains is present, remains should be verified as they are offloaded.
   Upon verification, mortuary personnel will sign for remains.
   12.16.2. Initiate the DD Form 1079, Interment/Disinterment Register.
130                                  AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


   12.16.3. Report remains suspected to have UXOs to the EOC.
   12.16.4. Leave clothing, gear (including helmets, vests, safety equipment, or organizational
   equipment) and personal effects on remains to aid in identification at the port mortuary to
   include the chemical warfare defense (CWD) suit. All items on the remains, except weapons,
   munitions, classified documents, and hazardous material, are to be shipped with the remains.
   12.16.5. Assign each remains an interment processing number by using the next sequential
   number from the DD Form 1079, Block 5. Use one page of DD Form 1079 for each row of
   10 remains. The number consists of an accumulative number and the current calendar year,
   e.g., 03-0024-2005 (row 3, remains number 24, calendar year 2005).
   12.16.6. Record information (interment processing number, date received and BTB-Name
   and SSN if available) on DD Form 1079.
   12.16.7. Place remains in a body bag; when bags are not available, they will be wrapped in a
   poncho or plastic. Two tags will be completed (use metal tags if available), each with the
   interment processing number. Tags will be attached as follows: One to the remains and one
   to the HRP. NOTE: If remains are fragmented, attach a tag to each portion of the remains
   recovered. Use the evacuation number to identify each portion of commingled remains
   believed to be the same. ―R‖ or ―P‖ numbers, as those used in S&R, are not needed for
   identification, they are only used in charting an accident site. NOTE: If time allows:
       12.16.7.1. Establish tentative (BTB) ID or use unidentified.
       12.16.7.2. Place the plastic pouch with DD Form 2064 and other information in the
       remains pouch. Close the remains pouch.
   12.16.8. Remains will be placed head to foot.
   12.16.9. PE will be buried with remains of US personnel.
   12.16.10. DD Form 1079 will be provided to the Theater Joint Mortuary Affairs Office
   (JMAO). Mortuary officer will retain a copy of the 1079 in the mortuary case file and
   forward a copy to HQ AFSVA.
12.17. Marking the Temporary Interment Site. To mark the site, a stake will be placed at the
beginning (head) and end of each row. The marker should extend at least three feet above the
ground. Attach a weather resistant sign to the stake bearing the following information: number of
remains and date of burials. CE will provide interment site coordinates using GPS, if available.
Determine the location of each row and record it on the DD Form 1079. NOTE: If remains are
contaminated, ensure the area has been clearly marked by CE Readiness.
12.18. Disinterments. Remains temporarily interred will be disinterred at the earliest possible
time. Remains should be recoverable at a future date and returned to Dover AFB Port Mortuary
for processing. AFME is responsible to determine when remains are safe to repatriate. The on-
scene commander is responsible for planning the opening of trench graves to ensure
accountability of remains using DD Form 1079. Whenever personnel are conducting
disinterment operations they should wear PPE, such as surgical masks, gloves, aprons, and other
types IAW OSHA standards. NOTE: If remains were contaminated, ensure proper re-supply of
PPE and protective clothing is available for MACP personnel and worn as required.
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                      131


   12.18.1. Once in the general area of the site, GPS, in conjunction with maps, should be used
   to determine the exact location of each row. Attempt to locate the markers that should have
   been placed at the beginning (head) of each row.
   12.18.2. The row may be opened from either end. Using a backhoe and digging with care,
   the operation may dig down approximately one and one half feet. Multiple rows may be
   opened simultaneously depending on available equipment. Remaining depth should be dug
   with hand tools so as not to mutilate the remains. Carefully remove dirt from all sides of the
   remains. Look for the tag attached to the outside of the HRP or shroud.
   12.18.3. Match the number on the tag to the DD Form 1079 processing number recorded
   during interment operations.
   12.18.4. If required, place the disinterred remains and HRP in a new HRP.
   12.18.5. If the HRP or shroud was not intact, the soil in the immediate area should be sifted
   for skeletal anatomy and PE.
   12.18.6. Complete the DD Form 1079 and prepare processing tag in the same manner as in
   interment operations. Attach this tag to the shroud or HRP.
   12.18.7. Place remains and HRP on a litter and remove them from the row or interment site.
   12.18.8. Evacuate the remains to the MACP for processing and further evacuation to the
   TMEP.
   12.18.9. After disinterment, the land should be restored to its original condition to the best
   possible extent.
   12.18.10. Report recovery through command channels to the Theater JMAO when all
   remains have been disinterred.

Section 12D—Contaminated Remains

12.19. Contaminated Remains Overview. This section provides instructions for handling
contaminated human remains and the precautions to take to protect personnel involved in
recovering and processing those remains. This instruction and Joint Pub 4-06 Joint Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures for Mortuary Affairs in Joint Operations are not meant to replace
the involvement of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) experts in the
decontamination process.
   12.19.1. If remains are contaminated with CBRNagents, all efforts will be made to
   decontaminate them and return them through routine channels. The Army, as the Executive
   Agent for Mortuary Affairs, has dedicated decontamination teams and is responsible to
   respond to all contamination events. They are responsible for decontamination and
   certification of remains as decontaminated prior to transport out of the AOR or CONUS. For
   remains that cannot be decontaminated, protecting the health of service members and the
   public must take precedence over the rapid repatriation of remains. Temporary refrigerated
   storage or interment of those contaminated remains still posing a threat to public health is the
   recommended method of disposition, until safe handling procedures and materials can be
   identified for temporary interment policy (paragraphs 12.14 through 12.18).
132                                  AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


   12.19.2. At the time of recovery, trained CBRN personnel will determine if a CBRN hazard
   exists and recommend appropriate PPE. If the hazard cannot be determined on an individual
   basis, all remains in the affected area will be treated as contaminated.
12.20. Handling Contaminated Remains. Currently, Air Force Services’ role in this process is
to perform temporary refrigerated storage or interment of remains, if it has been determined
remains cannot be decontaminated.
   12.20.1. Services representatives in the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) will request
   mortuary affairs decontamination team support from the theater forward headquarters and/or
   approval for temporary storage or interment.
   12.20.2. The Unit Control Center (UCC) will be informed that the handling operation for
   (chemically/biologically) contaminated remains is about to commence. Final approval will be
   requested before beginning this operation. Follow UCC instructions in the event they direct
   alternative actions be taken. If the mortuary affairs or CBRN reconnaissance team members
   are uncertain as to whether or not remains have been chemically contaminated, treat them as
   if they are.
   12.20.3. In the event the Army cannot decontaminate remains or they cannot respond in a
   timely manner, AF Services personnel will follow the process in Table 12.1
   12.20.4. If remains are identified, HQ AFSVA will contact the PADD and inform them
   remains must remain in-theater due to contamination.
   12.20.5. Remains should be recoverable at a future date and returned to Dover AFB Port
   Mortuary for processing.
12.21. Contaminated Personal Effects. Return of contaminated PE to the family is not
guaranteed. In instances where the PE are contaminated and there is no effective way to
decontaminate the substance (paper for example), these effects will be interred with the remains
and the family informed of the situation by HQ AFSVA mortuary staff.

Table 12.1. Processing Contaminated Remains.

  1.   If remains cannot be decontaminated and approval has been obtained, team chief will confirm
       with the Bioenvironmental Engineer in the EOC who will recommend appropriate PPE.
       Mortuary personnel, in appropriate PPE or MOPP 4, will examine remains for the presence of
       any weapons, ammunition or UXO. Remains suspected to have unexploded ordnance (UXOs)
       must be reported to the Civil Engineer representative in the Emergency Operations Center
       (EOC). Contaminated weapons should be double bagged and marked.

  2.   Check the ensemble for BTB information and follow usual tag composition procedures – BTB
       name information, SSN and if transporting remains to the Mortuary Affairs Decontamination
       Collection Point (MADCP), the evacuation number.

  3.   If medical personnel have not arrived, contact UCC about need to complete DD Form 2064 or
       other appropriate medical forms. Place all paperwork in sealed bag and place in inner HRP.
AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                        133



  4.   Properly mark remains. Use the appropriate CBRN marking kit signs for inside and outside of
       the HRP if available. If marking kits are not available, place the letter ―C‖ on the BTB
       information tags, to identify CBRN contamination. An adhesive ―GAS‖ sticker or ―Gas‖ sign
       with the suspected type of chemical agent used or affix a BIO marker from the marking kits for
       the type of suspected BIO agent the remains were exposed to if known. Attach one tag to the
       remains, one to the HRP, and complete DD Form 1077.

  5.   Double-pouch remains. First, place remains into HRP, leaving clothing, gear (including helmets,
       vests, safety equipment or organizational equipment) and PE on remains to aid in identification
       at the port mortuary (including the chemical warfare defense (CWD) suit). All items on the
       remains, except weapons, munitions, classified documents and hazardous material, are to be
       shipped with the remains. Then, place the first HRP into another HRP. HRPs will be contained
       in either sealed refrigerators or temporarily interred until Army decontamination units can
       attempt decontamination. Chemical, biological and radiological remains may need to be stored
       separately by contaminating agent. Biologically contaminated remains should be segregated as
       non-contagious pathogen, contagious pathogen or toxin. If remains cannot be decontaminated,
       consult the AFME or medical representative regarding obtaining a DNA specimen prior to
       temporary interment. Personnel collecting DNA specimen should be in MOPP4 if remains have
       not been decontaminated.

  6.   Notify HQ AFSVA, through the Component headquarters Services staff that remains cannot be
       decontaminated and will be temporarily interred. See paragraph 12.14. for temporary interment
       instructions. HQ AFSVA will contact AFME and request they obtain a DNA specimen of
       remains.

  7.   AFME will ensure DNA specimens have been irradiated (to minimize contamination) and
       shipped to the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL).

  8.   If temporary interment is necessary, CE will assist in site selection and site preparation.
       Contaminated remains must be buried 6 ½ feet deep.

  9.   Temporary graves will be marked and 24-hour security provided.

 10. Accurately address the number and status of contaminated remains within daily SITREPs.

 11. Personnel collecting DNA specimen should be in MOPP4 if remains have not been
     decontaminated.
12.22. Health and Safety. Safety is a major concern in all operations. Leaders must be aware
of safety-related factors involving remains handling and ensure Operational Risk Management is
integrated into processes and operations. Sanitation of the morgue and personnel should be
constantly monitored.
   12.22.1. Sanitation. Gloves and ensemble will be decontaminated with M295 kits, M291 kits
   and/or 5% chlorine solution after handling contaminated remains or articles and then rinsed
   in clear water solution. To minimize possible transfer hazards, mortuary affairs personnel
134                                   AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


   must be aware of symptoms of early exposure that would indicate cross contamination from
   remains or PE. If not already known, obtain this information from the CE readiness
   representative in the EOC. NOTE: In case of biological attack, these symptoms may not
   show up for hours, days or even weeks due to toxins or pathogens. In the event of cross
   contamination, immediately take appropriate self-aid/buddy care (SABC) actions and report
   the onset of any of these symptoms to the mortuary team leader, and in case of biological
   exposure, report to the medical treatment center. The morgue will be disinfected daily or as
   needed, by mopping the floor and wiping down tables with hot water and cleaning solutions.
   12.22.2. Heat Stress. Heat stress is a vital aspect when working in the morgue. Supervisors
   must watch for signs of heat injury.
   12.22.3. Work and Rest Cycles. Once personnel reach their maximum workload for heat
   stress, they cannot recover quickly enough to accomplish the mortuary mission.
   12.22.4. Lifting Requirements. Personnel must follow proper lifting techniques when
   moving remains. Each individual should not lift more than 75 pounds. They should be
   instructed on how to lift with their legs, not their back. Use a back belt when strenuous lifting
   occurs.
   12.22.5. Blood-Borne Pathogens. During the handling of remains, care is taken to avoid
   exposure to blood or body fluids. Rubber gloves, aprons, surgical masks, and eye protection
   must be worn when working with remains. If contact is made, wash the area immediately
   with disinfectant or soap solution.
   12.22.6. Control/Disposal of Contaminated Waste. CBRN attacks can generate significant
   quantities of contaminated waste. Contaminated items could include PPE and field gear, M8
   and M9 paper, components of the M291 and M295 decontamination kits, contamination
   avoidance covers and bulk plastics, and personal equipment. Mortuary personnel should
   collect contaminated items, double wrap, mark as contaminated, and store-contaminated
   items in a closed container. CE Readiness personnel will determine if they can be reused. Do
   not automatically dispose of any items. Services should work with CE to develop specific
   procedures for handling and disposing of contaminated waste as part of their Base Bio-
   Defense plans.
   12.22.7. Exposure Symptoms Awareness. Mortuary affairs personnel must be aware of
   symptoms of early exposure to (AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual).
   12.22.8. Briefings. Personnel involved in contingency mortuary operations must receive
   intervention from the Traumatic Stress Response Team IAW 44-143, Traumatic Stress
   Response, prior to returning to their regular duties.
12.23. Required Supplies and Equipment. To prevent contamination of Services personnel
during limited handling and movement of contaminated remains, the MACP will have as a
minimum the amounts and types of CBRN defense equipment in (Table 12.2). Additional
MOPP 4 outer garments may be required for the handling and processing of contaminated
remains and for S&R operations. With the increased terrorist threat, MOPP 4 protective gear
may need to be made available for MACP and S&R operations at home station as part of the
installation Bio-Defense Base Plan.

AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009                                                       155


   A4.5.1. Members of the armed services of the United States on the active and retired lists as
   published by the decedent’s service.
   A4.5.2. The wife, husband, widow, widower, minor child and, in certain instances, the
   dependent unmarried adult child of any person listed above. Dependent, unmarried adult
   children include those who have never married, widows, widowers and divorcees. This is,
   provided the unmarried adult child, at time of death was incapable of self-support because of
   physical or mental condition and receiving over one-half of his or her support from the
   service-connected parent or surviving spouse, or has been receiving such support prior to the
   death of the parents and by reason of their death was receiving such support from some other
   source.
   A4.5.3. General prisoners whose discharges have been executed and who die while under
   the jurisdiction of the Department of the Air Force.
   A4.5.4. Prisoners of war, interred aliens and unclaimed remains that cannot be transferred to
   the custody of civil authority, provided no other disposition of remains is made under
   existing statutes.
   A4.5.5. Veterans, when a dependent family member of the deceased was previously buried
   in such a cemetery.
   A4.5.6. Individuals whose remains are directed to be disposed HQ AFSVA/SVOM.
A4.6. When the Family Member Died Before the Eligible Member.
   A4.6.1. If a dependent family member dies before the service member, interment is made in
   an installation cemetery upon submission of a certificate signed by the service member
   verifying he or she will be interred in the same grave or an adjoining (side-by-side) grave.
   This certificate will be presented or promptly mailed to the base mortuary officer. The
   certificate will state, ―This is to certify that in consideration of the interment of the remains
   of my (spouse-child) (name), in the (name) Base Cemetery, my remains shall, upon my
   demise, be interred in the same or adjoining grave."
   A4.6.2. When a dependent child is interred prior to the death of either parent, the service
   member will complete the certificate referenced in paragraph A4.6.1 The certificate will be
   completed with the understanding all available space in the occupied grave must be used for
   any future family interment before the second grave can be used and this applies to the
   service member as well.
   A4.6.3. Additional eligible dependent family members may be interred before the death of
   the service member, provided not more than two side-by-side graves are used and the space
   is reserved for burial of the service member.
A4.7. Reserving Gravesites. Gravesites are not reserved or assigned in advance of interments
except for adjoining gravesites. When the service member dies first, an adjoining grave may be
reserved for the eventual interment of the surviving spouse. The spouse must request their
interment reservations at the time interment arrangements are being made for the member. The
surviving spouse receives an inquiry every two years to verify whether to continue the
reservation. Until the inquiry is received, it will not be necessary for the spouse to contact the
base concerned to continue the reservation. Failure to reserve an adjoining gravesite does not
preclude burial of the spouse in the same grave with the service member or removal of remains
156                                    AFI34-242_RANDOLPHAFBSUP_I 25 AUGUST 2009


at private expense to a location where two adjoining graves are available. When arrangements
are made for the interment of a dependent of a service member, the surviving service member
requests an adjoining gravesite be reserved.
A4.8. Disposal. When feasible, base cemeteries are disposed of according to the provisions of
AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property. Normally, the General Services Administration
accomplishes disposal by transfer to a state, county, municipality, or other proper agency or by
removal and re-interment of remains in a government, private, or public cemetery or by transfer
of custody to the PADD or other relatives. Once a cemetery disposal is complete, it will not be
reacquired without prior approval of an acquisition request as outlined in AFI 32-9001,
Acquisition of Real Property.
   A4.8.1. Maintain all roads and walks in a manner that protects the government investment.
   Keep them in safe condition. Apply dust palliatives to roads and walks where necessary.
   A4.8.2. Maintain structures, including buildings, walls, fences, gates, and flagpoles, to
   ensure stability. The necessity for repainting cemetery structures is determined on the basis
   of preservation and appearance.
   A4.8.3. Keep grave markers clean and neat in appearance at all times. Replace only when
   defaced or damaged to the extent that they no longer present an acceptable appearance. Reset
   and realign when necessary to maintain uniformity of appearance and arrangement.
   A4.8.4. Maintain water distribution systems as necessary to provide a supply of water
   adequate to meet requirements for the cemetery.
   A4.8.5. Due to soil and climate variations, geographical locations, structure types and
   permanence, plus other factors, detailed criteria for cemetery maintenance is prescribed by
   each installation commander having responsibility for such work.
   A4.8.6. Do not initiate new construction work at base cemeteries. Improvements, alterations,
   or extensions to existing facilities are not authorized. The replacement of, or major repairs to,
   existing roads, walks, grounds, fences, buildings, drainage facilities, or other features will be
   accomplished only where determination is made that the cemetery will remain indefinitely
   and that its maintenance will continue to be the responsibility of the Department of the Air
   Force.
A4.9. Record and Reports. A complete record of interments will be maintained in base
cemeteries. At the end of each month, AF Form 593, Interment Record-Base Cemetery will be
prepared in duplicate. The original will be sent to the MAJCOM concerned and the duplicate will
be retained at the installation. On closure of an installation where a base cemetery is located, the
Base Records Manager will request disposition instructions for cemetery and burial records in
accordance with AFI 33-364.
A4.10. Maintenance of Cemeteries. Cemeteries are classified as improved grounds according
to the standards for maintenance of grounds and drainage as adopted by DOD. Lands in this
classification are maintained at a degree necessary to present a desirable appearance. This work
includes, but is not limited to, periodic mowing, fertilization, weed control, insect and rodent
control, plant disease control, pruning and renovation of trees, shrubs and vines, removal of
debris and control of traffic. The maintenance of storm drainage systems is performed to the
extent necessary to prevent water damaging soil erosion and recurrent flooding. All maintenance
