This Air Force Instruction (AFI) explains how to discharge active duty Air Force officers for
substandard performance of duty, misconduct, moral or professional dereliction, homosexual
conduct, or in the interest of national security. It prescribes procedures for disposing of cases
involving officers and for processing cases approved under AFI 31-501, Personnel Security
Program Management. This AFI implements Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 1332.30,
21 December l993, and Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-32, Military Retirements and
Separations. It contains guidance for conducting boards of inquiry (BOI). This AFI doesn't apply
to Air National Guard units or members when not on active duty. It also doesn't apply to US Air
Force Reserve units and members when not on active duty, including individual mobilization
augmentees, or other individual reservists administered by Air Reserve Personnel Center. Refer
to Attachment 1 for a glossary.

The Air Force judges the suitability of officers for continued service on the basis of their conduct
and their ability to meet required standards of duty performance and discipline. Continued
service as an officer is a privilege that the Secretary of the Air Force may end. An officer who
fails to meet and maintain performance standards consistent with that officer's grade and
experience is subject to having that service ended. The same applies to officers who do not
maintain high standards of professional and personal conduct. The Air Force has both the right
and the responsibility to identify such officers and to take appropriate administrative action.

This AFI requires the collection and maintenance of records protected by the Privacy Act of
1974. Authorities to collect and maintain the records prescribed in this AFI are Title 10, U.S.C.,
section 8013, and AFPD 36-32. Privacy Act statements required by AFI 37-132, Air Force

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises AFI 36-3206 by (1) adding provisions for officers who have made an
unrestricted report of sexual assault within last year of their right to request review and approval
by the show cause authority of their proposed discharge where the officer asserts the discharge is
in retaliation for a sexual assault report; (2) adding provisions for mandatory involuntary
discharge processing of officers who commit rape, rape of a child, sexual assault, sexual assault
of a child, aggravated sexual contact, abusive sexual contact, forcible sodomy, or attempt to
commit these offenses, and waiver of discharge provisions where officers prove they meet
specific retention criteria; and (3) adding an enumerated involuntary separation provision for
officers who engage in an unprofessional relationship while serving in a special position of trust
as recruiter, faculty or staff.

                                USING THIS INSTRUCTION

1.1. Show-Cause Authority (SCA). The SCA determines whether the information or evidence
presented warrants initiation of discharge action before referring a case to an administrative
board under Chapter 6 or Chapter 7, as appropriate. If the SCA determines that the information
or evidence does not warrant discharge action, the SCA notifies the officer pending discharge
action that the action is terminated. MAJCOM commanders will delegate SCA to wing
commanders who are general officers or General Court-Martial Convening Authorities for wings
not commanded by a general officer, unless they personally determine that specific delegations
cannot be made because of unusual circumstances.
1.2. Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and Personnel Staffs. The servicing SJA and personnel
staffs advise commanders as to whether or not there is sufficient information or evidence to
initiate discharge action in accordance with this AFI.
1.3. HQ AFPC/DPPRS. HQ AFPPC/DPPRS advises commanders, SJAs, and SCAs on
administrative procedures and requirements. HQ AFPC/DPPRS ensures cases meet the
administrative processing requirements according to this AFI before sending them to either:
     1.3.1. HQ USAF/JAG.
     1.3.2. The Air Force Personnel Council (AFPC).

          DETERMINING WHETHER TO DISCHARGE FOR SUBSTANDARD
                        PERFORMANCE OF DUTY

2.1. Character of Discharge.

   the Secretary of the Air Force (OSAF) may direct:
       2.1.1.1. A discharge under honorable conditions (general)
       2.1.1.2. An honorable discharge
2.2. Identifying Substandard Performance of Duty. Commanders or other cognizant
authorities document an officer’s substandard performance of duty in any or all of these forms:
   2.2.1. Performance reports.
   2.2.2. Records of formal counseling.
   2.2.3. Admonishments or reprimands.
   2.2.4. Training reports.

paragraphs:
   2.3.1. Failure to show acceptable qualities of leadership required of an officer of his or her
   grade.
   2.3.2. Failure to achieve acceptable standards of proficiency required of an officer of his or
   her grade.

   2.3.5. A record of marginal service over an extended time as shown by performance reports
   covering two or more jobs and prepared by at least two different supervisors.
   2.3.6. Apathy or defective attitude when the officer is unable or unwilling to expend effort.
   2.3.7. Mental disorders that interfere with the officer's performance of duty and don't fall
   within the purview of the medical disability process. A psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist
   must conduct an evaluation. The evaluation must confirm any of these diagnoses as defined
   in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, current edition:
       2.3.7.1. Personality disorder.
       2.3.7.2. Disruptive behavior disorder.
 10                                                                 AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


      2.3.7.3. Adjustment disorder.
      2.3.7.4. Impulse control disorder.
      2.3.7.5. Other disorders, including gender identity disorders as defined in the Diagnostic
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, current edition, that interfere with
      performance of duty and don’t fall within the purview of the medical disability process.
      NOTE: A gender identity disorder may be transsexualism or a gender identity disorder of
      adolescence or adulthood.
   2.3.8. Failure in the Air Force Fitness Program as specified in AFI 10-248, Fitness Program
   (formerly AFIs 40-501 and 40-502). NOTE: Administrative actions commenced on or before
   31 Dec 03 may be executed to completion, using this paragraph and separation program
   designator (SPD) codes BCR and GCR. Officers who have been notified in writing IAW this
   directive on or after 1 Jan 04 (as specified in AFI 10-248) will be separated using SPD codes
   BFT and GFT and paragraph 2.3.9.
   2.3.9. Failure to conform to prescribed standards of dress, physical fitness, or personal
   appearance. The SCA initiates action as specified in Chapter 3 when he or she determines
   that the failure is deliberate.
   2.3.10. Inability to perform duties or meet military commitments because of family care
   responsibilities.
   2.3.11. Failure to maintain satisfactory progress while in an active status student officer
   program.

AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                         11


                                          Chapter 3

  DETERMINING WHETHER TO DISCHARGE FOR MISCONDUCT, MORAL OR
   PROFESSIONAL DERELICTION, OR IN THE INTERESTS OF NATIONAL
                           SECURITY

3.1. Character of Discharge.
   3.1.1. When directing an officer’s discharge in accordance with this chapter, the Office of
   the Secretary of the Air Force (OSAF) may direct:
      3.1.1.1. A discharge under other than honorable conditions (UOTHC).
      3.1.1.2. A discharge under honorable conditions (general).
      3.1.1.3. An honorable discharge. NOTE: The three types of character of discharge are
      further described in paragraph 1.7 of AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers.
   3.1.2. An honorable discharge is normally appropriate when the basis for discharge pertains
   solely to precommissioning activities. EXCEPTION: A discharge UOTHC or a discharge
   under honorable conditions (general) may be appropriate if an officer intentionally
   misrepresents or omits facts in official statements, records or commissioning documents.

          3.1.3.1.6. DELETED.
          3.1.3.1.7. DELETED.
   3.1.4. In drug or alcohol abuse cases, the SCA or BOI may consider all relevant and
   admissible evidence on the issue of retention or discharge. However, the SCA or BOI may
   not consider the following in determining the character of discharge:
      3.1.4.1. Evidence that the officer provides voluntarily when seeking treatment and
      rehabilitation for drug abuse if the officer’s actions meet the requirements for self-
      identification in AFI 36-2701, Social Actions Program.
      3.1.4.2. Results of mandatory urinalysis testing for controlled substances as part of:
          3.1.4.2.1. A command-directed examination as defined in AFI 36-2701.
          3.1.4.2.2. A specified member's referral for a medical purpose when the case
          involves a reasonable suspicion of drug abuse.
 12                                                                    AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


           3.1.4.2.3. An examination of a specified member participating in a drug treatment
           and rehabilitation program.
       3.1.4.3. Information provided by the officer in response to questions about intoxicated
       driving offenses if the officer’s statements conform with the provisions on screening
       members as specified in AFI 36-2701.
       3.1.4.4. The limitations in paragraphs 3.1.4.2.2, and 3.1.4.3 don't apply to:
           3.1.4.4.1. Evidence introduced to impeach or rebut evidence introduced by the
           officer.
           3.1.4.4.2. The results of urinalysis testing in circumstances other than that
           specifically excluded in the above paragraphs.
       3.1.4.5. The SCA consults with the local SJA in deciding how to use urinalysis evidence.
       NOTE: If the SCA or BOI considered any of the above and recommended a discharge
       under honorable conditions (general) or a discharge UOTHC, the SCA or BOI will
       specify which evidence warranted the less than fully honorable discharge
       recommendation.
   3.1.5. A discharge more severe than the one recommended by a BOI may not be approved.
3.2. Misconduct or Moral or Professional Dereliction. The procedures in this AFI are
administrative. Commanders must not use them as a substitute for punitive or disciplinary action
under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
   3.2.1. Wing or comparable commanders may take administrative action when evidence of
   misconduct and moral or professional dereliction raises doubts about an officer's suitability
   for continued service, regardless of whether the officer has already received judicial or
   nonjudicial punishment. Disciplinary action should normally be completed prior to initiation
   of administrative separation action but pending disciplinary action does not preclude
   initiation of administrative discharge action.
   3.2.2. The SCA should not normally initiate action based solely on the same allegation(s)
   which resulted in an acquittal (or equivalent action) in a military or civilian court. However,
   a wing commander or other authority may initiate action based on substantive information
   not available or admitted at trial, or if the court action was terminated for reasons not related
   to the guilt or innocence of the officer.
3.3. Sexual Assault. Sexual assault and sexual assault of a child are incompatible with military
service and members who commit these offenses are subject to discharge for misconduct.
   3.3.1. Sexual assault for purposes of this Instruction includes a broad category of sexual
   offenses consisting of the following specific UCMJ offenses: rape, sexual assault,
   aggravated sexual contact, abusive sexual contact, forcible sodomy (forced oral or anal sex),
   or attempts to commit these offenses. Sexual assault of a child for purposes of this
   Instruction includes a broad category of sexual offenses upon children consisting of the
   following specific UCMJ offenses: rape of a child, sexual assault of a child, and sexual
   abuse of a child.
   3.3.2. The presence in the military environment of persons who commit sexual assault or
   sexual assault of a child undermines the ability of our members to work effectively as a team,
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                          13


  impairs the readiness of our Force, and significantly detracts from accomplishing the military
  mission. Members who commit a sexual assault or sexual assault of a child adversely affect
  the ability of the Air Force to:
     3.3.2.1. Maintain discipline, good order, and morale.
     3.3.2.2. Foster mutual trust and confidence among members.
     3.3.2.3. Facilitate assignments and prevent disruptions in worldwide deployment.
     3.3.2.4. Recruit and retain members.
     3.3.2.5. Maintain public acceptability of military service.
  3.3.3. Processing Procedures.
     3.3.3.1. Action required. Commanders must act promptly when they have information
     indicating an officer has committed an act(s) that would render the officer subject to
     discharge for sexual assault or sexual assault of a child. They evaluate the specific
     circumstances of the offense, the officer’s record and potential for future service, and
     take prompt action to initiate show cause notification or waiver action in accordance with
     the following paragraphs:
         3.3.3.1.1. If show cause notification is warranted, it must be started promptly.
         However, there is no time limit for initiating show cause notification, and failure to
         do so does not at any time constitute a constructive waiver. Involuntary separation
         processing is waived only if a waiver is expressly approved under paragraph 3.3.3.2.
         3.3.3.1.2. If the commander determines a waiver of involuntary separation processing
         is appropriate, a request for waiver must be processed promptly. See paragraph
         3.3.3.2.
     3.3.3.2. Waiver of Involuntary Separation Processing. An officer found subject to
     discharge for sexual assault or sexual assault of a child under paragraph 3.2 may warrant
     consideration for waiver of involuntary separation processing. In deciding whether to
     recommend a waiver, commanders must give full consideration to: the victim’s views on
     retention of the officer, the nature of the offense involved, all the circumstances
     surrounding the offense, any matters in extenuation, the officer’s military record, the
     officer’s potential for future productive service, and an evaluation of the retention criteria
     in paragraph 3.3.3.3.
         3.3.3.2.1. The commander must determine that the facts and circumstances of an
         officer’s case meet the retention criteria in paragraph 3.3.3.3 and therefore warrant a
         recommendation for waiver action.
         3.3.3.2.2. A commander who recommends waiver of involuntary separation
         processing sends a recommendation to the SCA. This provides the commander's
         reasons for recommending the waiver and must include:
             3.3.3.2.2.1. Evidence substantiating the officer’s sexual assault or sexual assault
             of a child. This will typically be the completed disciplinary or administrative
             action taken as a result of the officer’s sexual assault (e.g., courts-martial orders,
             Article 15 actions, letters of reprimand, etc.).
14                                                                   AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


            3.3.3.2.2.2. Any available investigation report, military or civilian, of the sexual
            assault or sexual assault of a child offense(s).
            3.3.3.2.2.3. The commander's statement explaining how the officer meets each of
            the retention criteria set forth in paragraph 3.3.3.3.
            3.3.3.2.2.4. Rehabilitative action taken in the officer’s case, if any, and results.
            3.3.3.2.2.5. Any other relevant information.
        3.3.3.2.3. The SCA may disapprove the waiver. The SCA may approve the waiver in
        accordance with paragraph 3.3.3.3.2, and no further action in the case is required. If
        it is disapproved, discharge processing must start at once in accordance with
        paragraph 4.18.
     3.3.3.3. Retention Criteria and Consideration.
        3.3.3.3.1. An officer found to have committed sexual assault or sexual assault of a
        child will be discharged unless the officer meets all of the following criteria:
            3.3.3.3.1.1. The conduct surrounding and including the sexual assault or sexual
            assault of a child is a departure from the member’s usual and customary behavior.
            3.3.3.3.1.2. The conduct surrounding and including the sexual assault or sexual
            assault of a child under all circumstances is not likely to recur.
            3.3.3.3.1.3. The sexual assault or sexual assault of a child did not involve the
            penetration, however slight, of the vulva or anus or mouth of another by any part
            of the body or by any object, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, or degrade
            any person or to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.
            3.3.3.3.1.4. The sexual assault or sexual assault of a child was not committed by
            (1) using force causing or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm to any
            person; (2) threatening or placing the other person in fear that any person will be
            subjected to death, grievous bodily harm, or kidnapping; (3) first rendering the
            other person unconscious; or (4) administering to the other person by force or
            threat of force, or without the knowledge or consent of the person, a drug,
            intoxicant, or other similar substance and thereby substantially impairing the
            ability of the other person to appraise or control conduct.
            3.3.3.3.1.5. The sexual assault or sexual assault of a child was not the result of an
            abuse of rank, grade, authority or position.
            3.3.3.3.1.6. Under the particular circumstances of the case, the officer's continued
            presence in the Air Force is consistent with the interest of the Air Force in
            maintaining proper discipline, good order, leadership and morale. Officers have
            special responsibilities by virtue of their status; fulfill an integral role in
            maintaining discipline; and, therefore, must exhibit high standards of personal
            integrity, loyalty, dedication, devotion to duty and leadership.
        3.3.3.3.2. In addition to the retention criteria, the board or the SCA must consider the
        impact of the sexual assault or sexual assault of a child on the victim and the views of
        the victim on retention. The burden of proving that retention is warranted under each
        of these limited circumstances rests with the officer. Findings regarding the existence
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                         15


          of each of the limited circumstances warranting an officer's retention are required of
          the board or the SCA only if:
              3.3.3.3.2.1. The officer clearly and specifically raises such limited circumstances.
              3.3.3.3.2.2. The board, or in the absence of a board, the SCA relies upon such
              circumstances to justify the officer's retention.
3.4. Fear of Flying. The Air Force considers professed fear of flying as professional
dereliction. The unit commander initiates action on a rated officer suspended from aviation
service under paragraph 3.7.1.3 of AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical
Ratings and Badges, because of professed fear of flying, and who has been found physically
qualified for flying duties. The unit commander includes a copy of the suspension from aviation
service in the case file.
   3.4.1. The BOI may retain a respondent who meets the criteria for discharge for fear of
   flying only if the respondent has nonflying skills critical to the needs of the Air Force.
3.5. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Related Reason.
   3.5.1. Officers may be discharged in accordance with paragraph 3.6.11 when officers don't
   follow lawfully ordered preventive medicine procedures for individual patients to prevent
   transmission of HIV infection. However, an officer may not be discharged solely on
   serologic evidence of HIV infection.
   3.5.2. A SCA may not initiate action by using any information that the officer discloses
   during or as a result of an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemiological
   assessment interview. EXCEPTION: The SCA may take action on evidence first introduced
   by the officer during proceedings on drug abuse or sexual misconduct or evidence derived
   independent of the epidemiological assessment interview.
3.6. When Action Is Proper. The SCA initiates action by citing one or more of these
paragraphs:
   3.6.1. Failure to meet financial obligations.
   3.6.2. Intentional or discreditable mismanagement of personal affairs.
   3.6.3. Drug abuse as defined in AFI 36-2701. See paragraph 3.1.4.
   3.6.4. Serious or recurring misconduct punishable by military or civilian authorities.
   3.6.5. Intentional neglect or intentional failure to either perform assigned duties or complete
   required training (including failure in any government-funded educational or training
   program due to personal negligence or factors within the officer’s control).
   3.6.6. Misconduct resulting in the loss of professional status necessary to performance of
   military duties.
   3.6.7. Intentionally misrepresenting or omitting facts in official statements, records, or
   commissioning documents.
   3.6.8. Sexual assault or sexual assault of a child, as defined in paragraph 3.3.1.

   3.6.9. Sexual perversion, including aberrant sexual behavior or acts of sexual misconduct,
   which includes, but is not limited to, the following specific UCMJ offenses: indecent
   viewing, visual recording or broadcasting; forcible pandering; indecent exposure.
   3.6.10. Sexual deviation, including transvestitism, exhibitionism, voyeurism, and others as
   defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, current edition.
   3.6.11. Professed fear of flying. See paragraph 3.4.
   3.6.12. Retention is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security. NOTE: The
   SCA initiates action only after ensuring required actions under AFI 31-501, Personnel
   Security Program Management have been completed.
      3.6.13. When the officer doesn't follow lawfully ordered preventive medical procedures to
      prevent transmission of HIV infection. See paragraph 3.5.
      3.6.14. An officer who is sentenced by a court-martial to a period of confinement for more
      than six months and not sentenced to a dismissal may be separated at any time after the
      sentence to confinement has become final and the person has served in confinement for a
      period of six months. Officers sentenced to a dismissal cannot be separated until the appellate
      review of his or her case is final as announced by AFLSA/JAJR.
   3.6.15. Unprofessional Relationship by Person Serving in Special Position of Trust as
   Recruiter, Faculty or Staff. See paragraph 3.8.
3.7. Recoupment. If an officer being separated for reasons under this chapter received
education assistance, special pay, or bonus money, recoupment may be appropriate. See
paragraph 4.37 for rules regarding recoupment.
3.8. Officers are subject to discharge for misconduct based on acts that constitute
fraternization or unprofessional relationships between recruiters and potential recruits
during the recruiting process or between students and faculty or staff in training schools or
professional military education setting. Unprofessional relationships include, but are not
limited to, those listed below.
   3.8.1. Dating or carrying on a social relationship with a potential recruit or trainee, seeking
   or engaging in sexual activity with, or making sexual advances to, or accepting sexual
   overtures from a potential recruit or trainee or member of the immediate family of a potential
   recruit or trainee.
   3.8.2. Using grade, position, threats, pressure or promises to attain or attempt to attain any
   personal benefit of any kind from a potential recruit or trainee or member of the immediate
   family of a potential recruit or trainee.

   from or becoming indebted to, soliciting donations (other than for Air Force approved
   campaigns) from, or using personal resources to provide a potential recruit or trainee or
   member of the immediate family of a potential recruit or trainee with lodging or
   transportation or any other benefit.
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                        17


                                          Chapter 4

                  COMMANDERS AND SHOW-CAUSE AUTHORITIES

Section 4A—General Guidance

4.1. Reinitiating Actions. When a show-cause authority, a board of officers, or the SAF retains
an officer on active duty, the SCA may:
   4.1.1. Reinitiate discharge action only on the basis of new information that again shows the
   officer may be subject to administrative discharge.
   4.1.2. Consider the file, including correspondence and documents from the previous action
   when reinitiating discharge action.
4.2. Limitations on Reinitiating. The SCA:
   4.2.1. Must wait 1 year beginning on the date that a board of inquiry (BOI) or board of
   review (BOR) retains an officer before reinitiating action for the same reasons under
   Chapter 2.
   4.2.2. May reinitiate action under Chapter 3 at any time but not for the same conduct that
   was the subject of the previous BOI or BOR proceeding unless the previous board findings
   and recommendations resulted from fraud or collusion.
4.3. Reassigning Officers. The unit commander submits a request for an officer's reassignment
to HQ AFPC or HQ USAF assignments office when the officer is assigned to activities not under
a SCA. NOTE: The reassignment places the officer under the jurisdiction of a SCA before a unit
commander may recommend initiation of discharge action. EXCEPTION: Reassignment isn't
necessary when a host tenant agreement exists which gives discharge authority over tenant
officers to the host SCA.
   4.3.1. SCAs don't reassign an officer to the jurisdiction of another SCA until the action ends
   except as authorized by HQ AFPC/DPPRS, when circumstances warrant reassignment.
   4.3.2. The Military Personnel Flight (MPF) notifies HQ AFPC/DPPRS and the appropriate
   assignments office at HQ AFPC or HQ USAF upon receiving reassignment instructions for
   an officer pending discharge action. The MPF takes no further action to reassign the officer
   until HQ AFPC provides additional instructions.
   4.3.3. SCAs don't reassign officers to a hospital for Physical Evaluation Board action when
   they are undergoing medical disability processing. See AFI 41-120, Medical Resource
   Management Operations for assignment status while undergoing disability processing.
   4.3.4. The MPF enters the assignment availability code 21 in the personnel data system
   (PDS) to show unavailability for reassignment.
   4.3.5. SCAs may reassign officers when a SCA terminates or withdraws the action, or a
   board of officers, or the SAF retains the officer.
4.4. Aviation Service Code. The MPF tells the Flight Management Office to enter the aviation
service code 04 in the PDS when the unit commander suspends a rated officer from aviation
service because of discharge action under this AFI.
 18                                                                     AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


4.5. Separation Under Normal Conditions.
   4.5.1. The SAF normally won't approve an officer's separation request submitted under AFI
   36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers, chapter 2, section A, when the officer is
   pending discharge action under this AFI.
   4.5.2. When officers have an established date of separation (DOS), MAJCOMs send the case
   file to HQ AFPC/DPPRP for appropriate action no later than 30 calendar days before the
   officer's DOS.
4.6. Processing Pending Cases. MPFs continue processing cases under the regulation or
instruction in effect at the time the commander initiates the discharge action.
4.7. Authority for Discharge. The authority for officer administrative discharges is vested in
the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) or his or her designee.
   4.7.1. MPFs cite AFI 36-3207 in the discharge documents as the authority for discharge.
4.8. Excess Leave. The SCA may grant an officer’s request for excess leave if the Air Force no
longer requires the officer’s presence to process the discharge case. AFI 36-3003, Military Leave
Program, governs excess leave. Officers will be advised in writing that they may request excess
leave at any time after the SCA forwards the case to HQ AFPC/DPPRS.
4.9. Waivers or Exceptions. The SAF may authorize waivers or exceptions to this AFI.
4.10. Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), Single Integrated Operational Plan -
Extremely Sensitive Information (SIOP-ESI), or Other Special Access Programs, and
Personnel Reliability Program (PRP).
      4.10.1. Unit commanders must comply with AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program
      Management, when recommending action under this AFI on an officer who has, or once had,
      access to SCI, SIOP-ESI, or other special access programs.
      4.10.2. Unit commanders must comply with AFI 36-2104, Nuclear Weapons Personnel
      Reliability, to decertify officers under the PRP prior to their discharge.
4.11. Effecting Discharge. MPFs normally discharge officers as soon as possible but no later
than 10 calendar days (20 calendar days if the officer is returning from overseas) from the date
that the MPFs receive separation instructions from HQ AFPC/DPPRS.
      4.11.1. The MPFs tell the officer of the discharge directed by the SAF.
      4.11.2. MPFs separate an officer who is enlisting to retire in enlisted status 3 calendar days
      before the end of the month.

Section 4B—Commanders

4.12. Evaluating Officers of Other Services. Unit commanders evaluate cases that involve
officers of other services who are serving with the Air Force. Commanders review these cases by
Air Force standards and send their recommendation for appropriate action directly to the SCA.
      4.12.1. The SCA sends the case with appropriate recommendation to HQ AFPC/DPPRS for
      referral to the officer’s service.
4.13. Documenting Cases.
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                       19

      in AFI 90-301.
      4.13.1.2. The legal office refers the summary or extract to the originating agency or
      higher authority for release approval.
      4.13.1.3. The legal office doesn't make OSI reports or privileged investigative
      documents part of a documented case or release them to the officer, officer's counsel, or
      to any board considering a case under this AFI.
      4.13.1.4. MPFs may include the OSI reports and investigative reports from other
      agencies when sending the case to the SCA.
      4.13.1.5. The SCA returns the investigative reports through channels to the military
      organization that submitted them after receiving the final decision.
      4.13.1.6. Military organizations dispose of the investigative reports or documents
      according to AFI 37-138, Records Disposition--Procedures and Responsibilities.
   4.13.2. Records of Non-judicial Punishment. Unit commanders include the official record of
   nonjudicial punishment in the case file as documentary evidence. Include any available
   written evidence that supported the nonjudicial punishment action.
   4.13.3. Medical Reports. Follow the guidance in AFI 41-103 when using and releasing
   medical data.
   4.13.4. Records Withheld in the Interest of National Security. The legal office, MPFs, or
   SCAs may not give an officer undergoing discharge proceedings under this AFI copies of
   records withheld under AFI 31-601. NOTE: The officer may obtain a summary of the
   withheld records from the legal office.
   4.13.5. Questions about Withholding Records. MPFs direct questions to the SCA about
   records withheld under AFI 31-601.
4.14. Unit Commander’s Responsibilities:
   4.14.1. Evaluating Information. Consult with the SJA and the MPF before deciding to
   proceed with disciplinary or administrative discharge action when reviewing information that
   involves violations under the UCMJ. Administrative separation action is not a substitute for
   disciplinary action.
   4.14.2. Documenting a Case. Ensure that the appropriate military authorities:
      4.14.2.1. Complete all inquiries and investigations.
      4.14.2.2. Consult with the SJA, inform the OSI of all suspected offenses, and request that
      the OSI investigate the allegations.
 20                                                                   AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


       4.14.2.3. Substantiate all the facts in the case.
       4.14.2.4. Compile and tab the documentation, including unclassified summaries of OSI
       reports and investigative reports furnished or prepared by other agencies.
       4.14.2.5. Comply with AFI 31-501 when the officers have, or once had, access to SCI,
       SIOP-ESI, or other special access programs.
       4.14.2.6. Comply with AFI 36-6001, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR)
       Program, paragraph 6.5.2, to notify the SCA when the commander is aware, or is made
       aware by the officer or others, that the officer is alleged to have been the victim of a
       sexual assault. In the recommending action memorandum (Attachment 3), the
       commander should include a statement indicating that the officer has reported being a
       past victim of sexual assault. The commander must provide sufficient information
       concerning the alleged assault and the respondent’s status to ensure a full and fair
       consideration of the officer’s military service and particular situation. As necessary,
       include information by reference with corresponding attachments. Commanders should
       consult with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and the servicing staff judge
       advocate for guidance on the level of information that may be applicable.
   4.14.3. Taking Action When Other Action Is Ongoing. Commanders should not delay
   evaluating information or recommending action under this AFI after taking other action (for
   example, promotion propriety action or action to terminate clinical privileges).
4.15. Show-Cause Authority (SCA) Responsibilities. The SCA may return a case to the unit
commander for further investigation or documentation without terminating the case. The SCA:
   4.15.1. Reviews the discharge action against an officer within his or her command.
   4.15.2. Evaluates all information presented concerning the case.
   4.15.3. Ensures the SJA completes a legal review and includes it in the case file, but not as

   the Air Force Personnel Board (AFPB).
   4.15.5. Terminates the case when determining that a discharge isn't warranted on the basis of
   the evidence.
   4.15.6. Determines whether to recommend the officer for discharge.
4.16. Determinations by the SCA. The SCA reviews the entire case and makes one of the
following determinations:
   4.16.1. Retain the officer on active duty either because:
       4.16.1.1. The officer's duty performance meets the standards prescribed for an officer of
       his or her grade and experience.
       4.16.1.2. The evidence is not sufficient to substantiate the allegations or the allegations
       are not serious enough to require the officer to show cause for retention on active duty.
   4.16.2. Initiate separation of the officer from active duty if:
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                          21


       4.16.2.1. The evidence is sufficient to substantiate the allegations and the allegations are
       serious enough to warrant the officer’s separation.
       4.16.2.2. The officer's duty performance is below the standards prescribed for an officer
       of his or her grade and experience.
4.17. Initiating Action:
   4.17.1. The SCA makes certain the requirements of AFI 31-501 have been met in initiating
   action on officers who have, or once had, access to SCI, SIOP-ESI, or other special access
   programs. Compliance with AFI 31-501 should be indicated in the show cause notification
   memorandum.
   4.17.2. The SCA may initiate action when a promotion selection board identifies officers
   with records showing that they are subject to action under this AFI.
   4.17.3. When the OSAF decides to hold disability processing in abeyance and the SCA
   initiates discharge action:
       4.17.3.1. The MPF sends a message with specific details to HQ AFPC/DPPD and HQ
       AFPC/DPPRS.
       4.17.3.2. The OSAF determines and directs final disposition of the dual disability and
       administrative discharge actions.
4.18. How Action Is Initiated:
   4.18.1. Process a fear of flying case under AFI 11-402. Unit commanders ensure that
   medical authorities have found the officer physically qualified for flying duties before
   recommending action under this AFI.
   4.18.2. Process a case involving violations of national security under AFI 31-501 before
   initiating action under this AFI.
   4.18.3. Notifying Officer. The SCA personally signs the notification memorandum
   (Attachment 4). The officer acknowledges the notification memorandum upon receiving it.
       4.18.3.1. The office preparing the notification memorandum sends copies to:
          4.18.3.1.1. HQ AFPC/DPPRS.
          4.18.3.1.2. The MPF for file in the officer's UPRG.
       4.18.3.2. When the SCA initiates action based on information received from a promotion
       selection board, the SCA sends copies of the notification memorandum to:
          4.18.3.2.1. The officer's commander .
          4.18.3.2.2. The officer's MPF.
          4.18.3.2.3. HQ AFPC/DPPRS.
   4.18.4. Counseling Officer. If the officer doesn’t contact the area defense counsel or declines
   counsel, the chief, personnel division, or the MPF commander, counsels the officer on these
   points:
       4.18.4.1. The officer's eligibility for separation pay, readjustment pay, or severance pay.
 22                                                                  AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


       4.18.4.2. The least favorable character of discharge that may be directed when accepting
       the officer's resignation (officers may submit a resignation after show cause notification
       and prior to the convening of a BOI).
       4.18.4.3. The least favorable character of discharge that the BOI may recommend when
       the officer doesn't submit a resignation.
       4.18.4.4. Recoupment of education assistance, special pay, or bonuses. See paragraph
       4.32.
   4.18.5. Special Processing Procedures for Officers Who Have Made an Unrestricted Report
   of a Sexual Assault. An officer who receives notification of a show cause action under
   Chapter 2 or Chapter 3 of this Instruction must be advised of the right to request review by
   the SCA if the officer believes the commander’s recommendation for involuntary separation
   was initiated in retaliation for having made an unrestricted report of a sexual assault within
   the last 12 months as of the date of show cause notification. The following additional criteria
   apply to officers who receive notification of a show cause action under Chapter 2 or Chapter
   3 of this Instruction and who have made an unrestricted report of a sexual assault within the
   last 12 months as of the date of notification of discharge:
       4.18.5.1. An officer may request review by the SCA of a show cause notification any
       time prior to approval of the discharge by SAF.
       4.18.5.2. An officer requesting review of a commander’s recommendation must
       affirmatively assert the belief that the involuntary separation recommendation was
       initiated in retaliation for making a report of sexual assault.
       4.18.5.3. When an officer requests review, the SCA must review the circumstances of,
       and grounds for, the commander’s recommendation for involuntary separation.
          4.18.5.3.1. If the SCA determines the involuntary separation recommendation was
          made in retaliation for the report of sexual assault, the SCA will terminate show cause
          notification proceedings. In such cases, the SCA may refer the retaliation
          determination to the appropriate inspector general for additional consideration and
          possible investigation.
          4.18.5.3.2. If the SCA determines the commander’s involuntary separation
          recommendation was not made in retaliation for the report of sexual assault, the SCA
          may approve continued processing of the show cause notification, if there is sufficient
          evidence to support separation and separation is warranted. The SCA must indicate
          that the commander’s involuntary separation recommendation was not made in
          retaliation for the report of sexual assault.
          4.18.5.3.3. In any case where the SCA terminates show cause notification based
          solely upon a finding that the recommendation for involuntary separation processing
          was initiated in retaliation for the report of sexual assault, the SCA may consider
          whether show cause notification should be initiated based on the facts of the case
          independent of the report of sexual assault.
4.19. Physical Qualification for Separation. The unit commander tells the medical treatment
facility of the possibility of action against the officer and provides necessary information. A
commander may refer an officer for mental health evaluation to determine the existence of

       paragraph 4.19.4 applies.
       4.19.2.3. When the officer shows evidence of mental illness, the medical officer attaches
       an evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist to the AF Form 422. The psychiatrist or

      NOTE: SCAs may, at their option, use their SJA offices instead of their personnel staffs to
      perform the functions in paragraphs 4.22.1 through 4.22.5.
4.23. Holding Actions in Abeyance. The following applies when an officer is undergoing
medical or disability evaluation and has ongoing actions under this AFI.
      4.23.1. HQ AFPC/DPPRS and HQ AFPC/DPPD must closely monitor the ongoing actions,
      including actions pending under AFI 36-3207.

   of the discharge action and disability case.
   4.23.5. If the disability action is terminated or the officer is found physically qualified for
   continued service, HQ AFPC/DPPRS tells the SCA to continue processing actions held in

      MAJCOM/CC may not disapprove the resignation and forwards a recommendation for
      disapproval to HQ AFPC/DPPRS.
4.26. Notifying HQ AFPC. The SCA sends a copy of the show cause notification
memorandum HQ AFPC/DPPRS, 550 C Street West, Ste 11, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4713.

Show Cause notification memorandum before sending a case to the AFPB through HQ
AFPC/DPPRS or referring a case to a BOI.
   4.27.1. When amending the notification memorandum, the SCA will give the officer the
   reasons for amending the action memorandum, enclose a copy of the SCA memorandum
   amending the show cause notification memorandum, and allow the officer 10 calendar days
   to prepare a response.
   4.27.2. If the SCA receives additional information after referring the case to a sitting BOI
   the SCA should forward the information to the recorder for submission to the BOI. If the
   SCA receives additional information after referring the case to the AFPB then the SCA
   should forward the information to the AFPB for consideration.
4.28. Referring Case to a Board of Officers. The SCA must refer a nonprobationary officer's
case to a BOI as specified in Chapter 7. The SCA may refer a probationary officer’s case to:
   4.28.1. The Air Force Personnel Board (AFPB) when recommending an honorable discharge
   or under honorable conditions (general) (see Chapter 6).

4.30. Voluntary Retirement. An officer may, at any time before the SAF decides his or her
administrative discharge case, apply for retirement when eligible under AFI 36-3203, Service
Retirements.
4.31. Processing Time Guidelines. Each level of command and headquarters processes cases
as efficiently as possible while protecting the officer’s rights throughout the administrative
discharge process. Case processing begins on the date that the officer receives the SCA’s
notification memorandum. Use express mail or overnight delivery to reduce mail time. NOTE:
The availability of counsel, BOI report transcribing capability, the need for referral to the Air
Force Physical Disability System, or other local circumstances may affect case processing.
Additionally, officers eligible for transition assistance program benefits may elect to take excess
leave or permissive TDY for relocation/transition activities. (Commanders are not required to
authorize either if doing so would interfere with the military mission). See AFI 36-3022,
Transition Assistance Program, for transition assistance benefit eligibility requirements and AFI
36-3003, Military Leave Program, for excess leave and permissive TDY eligibility requirements.
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                        27


4.32. Recoupment of Education Assistance, Special Pay, or Bonuses.
   4.32.1. Recoupment Requirements. The Air Force normally requires recoupment of a
   portion of education assistance, special pay, or bonus money received when officers separate
   before completing the period of active duty they agreed to serve.
      4.32.1.1. Education assistance includes such programs as:
          4.32.1.1.1. Service academy.
          4.32.1.1.2. Armed forces health profession scholarship program.
          4.32.1.1.3. Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.
          4.32.1.1.4. ROTC college scholarship program.
          4.32.1.1.5. Tuition assistance.
          4.32.1.1.6. Minuteman education program.
          4.32.1.1.7. Air Force Institute of Technology.
      4.32.1.2. The recoupment in all cases will be an amount that bears the same ratio to the
      total amount or cost provided the officers as the unserved portion of active duty bears to
      the total period of active duty they agreed to serve.
   4.32.2. Basis for Recoupment.
      4.32.2.1. If the SAF directs involuntary separation for any reason in Chapter 2 or
      Chapter 3, the officer is subject to recoupment of a portion of education assistance,
      special pay or bonus money received.
   4.32.3. Dispute of Education Assistance Debt. When a member who is subject to
   recoupment of educational assistance disputes that debt, the SCA will appoint an officer (or a
   civilian employee) to conduct an inquiry into the facts and hear evidence presented by the
   member and other parties as appropriate, to determine the validity of the debt. If the case
   involves a BOI, that board will conduct the inquiry. The SCA will forward the report of
   inquiry, together with his/her recommendation concerning recoupment, with the case to the
   SAF for decision. See Attachment 4 for required notification to officer.

                         AIR FORCE PERSONNEL BOARD (AFPB)

6.1. Purpose. The Air Force Personnel Board (AFPB) reviews officer discharge cases and
makes recommendations to OSAF or designee when:
   6.1.1. A BOI recommends discharge in accordance with the procedures of Chapter 7.
   6.1.2. The SCA recommends the separation of a probationary officer. (NOTE. The SCA
   forwards the original and one copy of the case file to HQ AFPC/DPPRS who refers the
   discharge case to the AFPB through HQ USAF/JAG.)
   6.1.3. An officer submits a resignation instead of undergoing further administrative
   discharge proceedings or a resignation for the good of the service.
6.2. Membership. The AFPB will be convened from officers assigned to the Secretary of the
Air Force Personnel Council.
6.3. Functions and Duties. The AFPB is an administrative board and thus not subject to the
rules and procedures governing civilian or military courts. AFI 51-602 does not apply to AFPB
proceedings. The AFPB considers all information presented to it and determines whether to
retain the respondent in the Air Force. It makes recommendations to the OSAF when it
determines that the respondent should not be retained or when circumstances of the case require
such consideration.
6.4. Appearance of Probationary Officers before the AFPB. Probationary officers or their
counsel may appear before the AFPB only if the AFPB decides that it needs the officer’s
testimony to evaluate the case. If the AFPB invites an officer to testify, the officer may have his
or her counsel attend the AFPB proceedings.
6.5. AFPB Recommendations on Probationary Officer Cases Not Involving a BOI. The
Board considers these options when making recommendations.
   6.5.1. Probationary Officers. The administrative discharge action of a probationary officer
   ends when the AFPB decides to retain an officer on active duty. When deciding not to retain
   a probationary officer on active duty, the AFPB.
   6.5.2. Recommends an honorable discharge if the basis for the discharge action is under
   Chapter 3 solely for precommissioning activities not involving intentional misrepresentation
   or omission of facts in official statements, records, or commissioning documents.
   6.5.3. Recommends an honorable discharge or a discharge under honorable conditions
   (general) if the basis for the discharge action is under Chapter 2 or Chapter 3, except for
   precommissioning activities not involving intentional misrepresentation or omission of facts
   in official statements, records, or commissioning documents.
   6.5.4. Recommends returning the case to the SCA for action under Chapter 7 if the board
   concludes that the case warrants a BOI hearing.
   6.5.5. Recommends the proper action to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force (OSAF)
   if the board determines that unusual circumstances warrant different procedures.
 30                                                                 AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


   6.5.6. Recommends acceptance or rejection of a resignation instead of undergoing further

   accordance with this AFI. The SCA may reassign the officer.
   6.6.2. Board Recommends Referral to a BOI. HQ AFPC/DPPRS returns the case to the SCA
   for action under Chapter 7.
   6.6.3. Board recommends acceptance or rejection of a resignation instead of undergoing
   further administrative discharge proceedings or resignation for the good of the service. The
   Board sends the case to the OSAF.

   sends the case to the OSAF.
   6.6.5. DELETED
6.7. Final Action of the SAF on Non-BOI Cases. The decision of the SAF or his or her
designee is final.
   6.7.1. When Officer Is Retained. The SAF decision ends the discharge action in accordance
   with this AFI. The SCA may reassign the officer.
   6.7.2. When Officer Is Not Retained. HQ AFPC/DPPRS issues instructions to discharge the
   officer as soon as possible but no later than 10 (20, if serving overseas) calendar days from
   receipt of instructions. Discharge authority is AFI 36-3207.
       6.7.2.1. The SAF directs an honorable discharge if the basis for the discharge action is
       under Chapter 3 solely for precommissioning activities not involving intentional
       misrepresentation or omission of facts in official statements, records, or commissioning
       documents.
       6.7.2.2. The SAF may direct an honorable discharge or a discharge under honorable
       conditions (general) when the basis for the discharge action is under Chapter 2 or
       Chapter 3, except for precommissioning activities not involving intentional
       misrepresentation or omission of facts in official statements, records, or commissioning
       documents.
   6.7.3. When Other Action Is Directed. HQ AFPC/DPPRS issues instructions for any other
   actions directed by the SAF.

USAF/JAG within 5 calendar days after receiving it. The case consists of the transcribed BOI
record with exhibits and any additional information submitted by the respondent.
   6.8.1. After completing its legal review, HQ USAF/JAG sends the BOI case to the SAFPC
   for referral to the AFPB.
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                         31


   6.8.2. Neither the respondent nor the respondent’s counsel may appear before the AFPB
   unless it decides that personal testimony is essential in evaluating the case. If the AFPB
   invites the respondent to appear, the respondent’s counsel may be present only when the
   respondent testifies.
6.9. AFPB Recommendations on BOI Cases. The Board considers these options when
making recommendations:
   6.9.1. The Board recommends retention when it determines that the respondent should be
   retained on active duty. When deciding not to retain a probationary officer on active duty,
   the AFPB:
   6.9.2. Respondent Not Eligible to Retire. When the AFPB determines that the respondent
   should not be retained on active duty, it recommends removing the respondent from active
   duty if the respondent is a regular officer or recommends discharge if the respondent is a
   reserve officer. When the AFPB recommends removal from active duty or discharge, it also
   recommends an honorable discharge or under honorable conditions (general) if the basis for
   discharge falls solely under Chapter 2 or an honorable discharge if the basis for discharge
   falls solely under Chapter 3 for precommissioning activities not involving intentional
   misrepresentation or omission of facts in official documents. In all other cases with a basis
   for discharge under Chapter 3, the AFPB may recommend an honorable discharge, a
   discharge under honorable conditions (general) or a discharge UOTHC.
   6.9.3. Respondent is a Regular officer and Eligible to Retire. When the AFPB determines
   that the respondent should not be retained on active duty, it recommends removal from active
   duty and retirement.
   6.9.4. Respondent is a Reserve Officer and Eligible to Retire. When the AFPB determines
   that the respondent should not be retained on active duty and the officer applied for voluntary
   retirement, it recommends retirement. If the respondent hasn’t applied for voluntary
   retirement, the AFPB recommends discharge and the character of discharge (see paragraph
   6.9.2).
   6.9.5. Other Action Recommended. If the AFPB determines that unusual circumstances
   warrant some other type of action, it recommends the action to the SAF.
   6.9.6. DELETED
6.10. Action on AFPB Recommendation. When the AFPB recommends retaining the
respondent, HQ AFPC/DPPRS advises the respondent, through the SCA, that the AFPB’s
determination ends the action. If appropriate, the SCA may reassign the officer.
   6.10.1. When the AFPB recommends removal from active duty, discharge, or other action,
   the AFPB sends the case to the SAF.
6.11. Final Action of the Secretary of the Air Force. The decision of the SAF or designee is
final.
   6.11.1. When Officer Is Retained. HQ AFPC/DPPRS advises the respondent, through the

                                           Chapter 7

                                 BOARD OF INQUIRY (BOI)

Section 7A—Pre-BOI Administrative Functions

7.1. Purpose. The BOI gives respondents who face discharge proceedings a fair and impartial
hearing, makes case findings, and recommends whether the Air Force should retain or discharge
officers. NOTE: "Respondent" refers to an officer who appears before a BOI.
7.2. Referring Case to BOI. The SCA refers the documented case to the BOI by letter
addressed "TO: Board of Inquiry Appointed by (paragraph, special order number, headquarters,
date). ATTN: Recorder." The SCA and the recorder may communicate directly with each other
on matters relevantto cases and board procedures.
7.3. Officer’s Rights When Notified to Show Cause for Retention.
   7.3.1. Written Notification. The SCA must send the officer written notification at least 30
   days before the BOI hearing. The notification will explain why the SCA is requiring the
   officer to show cause for retention on active duty and the least favorable characterization of
   discharge authorized. Written notification should normally be served on the respondent by
   the unit commander or another officer designated to make service. If the officer is
   unavailable for personal service of notification (ie: in civil confinement) notification will be
   made by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt (or by an equivalent form of notice if
   such service by U.S. Mail is not available for delivery at an address outside the United
   States) to the officer’s last known address or to the next of kin.
   7.3.2. Delay to Prepare. See paragraph 7.11.
   7.3.3. Personal Appearance or Representation Before a BOI. The respondent may appear in
   person at all open proceedings of the BOI. Nonresponse to the notification letter may be
   construed as the respondent’s voluntary election not to appear before the Board. Either
   military counsel appointed according to AFI 61-201, Military Justice Guide, or military
   counsel of the respondent’s own choice, if requested and approved according to AFI 61-201,
   may represent the respondent, but not both. The respondent may be represented by civilian
   counsel, retained at his or her own expense, in addition to or instead of military counsel.
       7.3.3.1. The military counsel must have the same qualifications as the recorder under
       Article 27(b)(1), UCMJ. NOTE: The respondent may waive this requirement.
       7.3.3.2. Either military or civilian counsel may represent a respondent who can't attend
       the hearing or waives the right to appear.
       7.3.3.3. The chief circuit defense counsel appoints a military lawyer to represent the
       officer who doesn't appear or isn't otherwise represented by counsel at the BOI hearing.
       The chief circuit defense counsel doesn't have to appoint a military counsel if the officer
       employs civilian counsel at no expense to the Government.
   7.3.4. Access to Relevant Records. The SCA gives officers copies of records considered
   relevant to his or her case on request. This requires strict compliance with paragraph 4.13.
 34                                                                  AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


      7.3.5. Witnesses. The respondents may request that the board invite any witness whose
      testimony bears on his or her case. A respondent may personally arrange the appearances of
      witnesses or ask the BOI recorder to contact the witnesses (see paragraph 7.12).
      7.3.6. Documents. A respondent may submit documents relevant to his or her case (for
      example, record of service, letters, responses, depositions, sworn or unsworn statements,
      affidavits, certificates, or stipulations) before the BOI convenes or during the hearing.
   7.3.7. Testifying. The legal advisor will advise the respondent of the provisions of Article
   31, UCMJ (10 U.S.C. 831). The respondent may testify, but is not required to do so. If a
   respondent wants to make a statement under oath, he or she is sworn in and will be subject to
   examination by the recorder and the board. If a respondent doesn’t want to make a sworn
   statement, he or she or may make an oral or written unsworn statement, personally or through
   counsel, or both. If the respondent or counsel makes an unsworn statement, the board may
   not examine them. However, the recorder may submit and the board may receive other
   evidence to rebut the unsworn statement.
   7.3.8. Report of Proceedings. The legal office gives the respondent an authenticated copy of
   the report of the proceedings. The respondent may submit written comments for
   consideration by the AFPB.
7.4. Voluntary Retirement. Any time before the SAF takes final action on the case, a
respondent who is eligible to retire may apply for retirement under AFI 36-3203.
   7.4.1. An officer with enough years of active military service but who does not have the
   required active commissioned service to retire in officer status may apply for discharge under
   AFI 36-3207, chapter 2, section B, to enlist and retire. If the BOI has not convened, the SCA
   suspends further action under this AFI. See paragraph 6.27 for guidelines for processing
   retirement applications if the BOI has convened.
   7.4.2. If a BOI recommends discharge of an officer who is otherwise eligible for voluntary
   retirement under any provision of law, the officer shall be retired in the grade and with the
   retired pay for which he would be eligible if retired under such provision regardless of the
   BOI’s recommendation.
7.5. Voluntary Discharge. Any time before the SAF or designee takes final action on the case,
an officer may apply for resignation under AFI 36-3207, chapter 2, section B, in lieu of further
administrative proceeding to be effective as soon as possible but no later than 10 calendar days
(20 calendar days if serving overseas) following notification of approval by the SAF. If the BOI
has convened, the SCA suspends further action under this AFI (see paragraph 7.27).
7.6. Functions and Duties. The BOI is an administrative board. It is not subject to the rules of
evidence and procedures governing civilian or military courts. Its function is not limited to
considering the information and the Statement of Reasons presented at its hearing. If before or
during the proceedings, the board decides it needs more information to properly evaluate the
case, it requests the information through the recorder.
   7.6.1. The BOI receives evidence presented during the board’s proceedings and develops
   added information to create a record on which to base a proper decision. The board evaluates
   evidence that it receives or develops during open hearings on the case; arrives at findings
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                          35


   consistent with the evidence presented; and makes recommendations consistent with the
   findings.
7.7. BOI Membership. The BOI consists of at least three voting members with the senior
member serving as president. In addition, the SCA or his or her designee (must be an officer in
the grade of colonel or above):
   7.7.1. Appoints a field grade judge advocate certified under Article 27b(2), UCMJ, or a
   company grade judge advocate certified as a military judge under Article 26b, UCMJ, to
   serve as a nonvoting legal advisor. NOTE: If the respondent is a judge advocate, the legal
   advisor must be senior in grade.
   7.7.2. Appoints a field grade officer to serve as a nonvoting recorder. NOTE: The SCA or
   his or her designee may appoint a company grade judge advocate qualified under Article
   27b(2), UCMJ, as a nonvoting recorder, and may detail alternate or assistant recorders to
   assist the nonvoting recorder. Assistant recorders who are judge advocates need not be
   certified under Article 27(b)(2), UCMJ.
   7.7.3. May assign a nonvoting interpreter when necessary. NOTE: If the SCA can't meet any
   of these requirements, the SCA notifies HQ AFPC/DPPRS without delay.
   7.7.4. If the case involves a regular officer, the voting members must be regular officers
   serving in a grade above lieutenant colonel and in a grade senior to the officer.
   7.7.5. If the case involves a reserve officer, the voting members must be in a grade above
   lieutenant colonel and in a grade senior to the officer. At least one voting member must be a
   reserve officer but doesn't have to be on the active-duty list. The SCA appoints the most
   senior reserve officer available if a reserve officer in a grade above lieutenant colonel is not
   available. A reserve officer in the grade of captain or above may serve as a voting member
   only if senior in grade to the respondent.
   7.7.6. When the BOI membership requires general officers, the SCA notifies HQ
   USAF/AFGOMO (General Officer Matters), Washington DC 20330-6060, at least 20
   calendar days before the scheduled convening date of the board and sends a copy of its notice
   to HQ AFPC/DPPRS.
   7.7.7. The SCA may not appoint officers who have any prior involvement with the case or
   who have served as voting members on a board convened against the same respondent under
   this AFI. This restriction doesn't apply to a BOI reconvened under paragraph 7.37.
7.8. Who May Not Be BOI Members. Officers may not serve on a BOI if they:
   7.8.1. Are witnesses in the case.
   7.8.2. Appeared as witnesses before any previous board convened under this AFI to review
   the record of the respondent.
   7.8.3. Served as members of any previous board convened under this AFI to review the
   record of the respondent.
   7.8.4. Served as members or convening or reviewing authority of a court-martial where the
   respondent was the accused.
 36                                                                    AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


      7.8.5. Previously recommended a discharge in the case or administered nonjudicial
      punishment pursuant to Article 15, UCMJ, to the respondent.
      7.8.6. Have written a referral performance report on the respondent.
      7.8.7. Have considered the case of the respondent and can't make an impartial judgment.
7.9. Who Appoints BOI. The SCA or his or her designee (must be in the grade of colonel or
above) normally publishes orders to appoint members to serve on a BOI within 2 days of receipt
of the officer's response to the SCA notification memorandum. The orders must include:
   7.9.1. A statement that the board members are appointed by order of the SAF and according
   to this AFI, Chapter 5.
   7.9.2. The place and date that the BOI will convene.
   7.9.3. The component (regular officer, reserve officer, ANG officer) after the name and
   grade of each board member.
   7.9.4. Copies of the orders appointing the board shall be provided to each board member and
   to the respondent and his or her counsel.
7.10. Time and Place for Convening BOI. Unless the officer requests delay or requests that
the board convene earlier, the SCA may direct that the BOI convene 30 calendar days from the
date that the officer receives the SCA notification memorandum. The BOI convenes at the
designated time and place, subject to approved delays or to approval of an earlier date requested
by the officer.
   7.10.1. The board normally convenes at the respondent's installation. However, the
   availability of witnesses and board members and other factors may make it necessary or
   advisable to convene the board elsewhere. The recorder schedules a meeting place for the
   BOI that is in keeping with the seriousness of the proceedings.
   7.10.2. The board recorder notifies the board members of the time and place set for the
   hearing. The recorder also notifies the respondent not less than 10 calendar days before the
   board convenes, even if the respondent does not intend to appear before the board. The
   recorder’s notification to the respondent will comply with AFI 51-602, Boards of Officers
   (see attachment 12). The recorder sends a copy of the notification memorandum to the SCA
   and HQ AFPC/DPPRS.
7.11. Delay in Convening the BOI. The respondent may request a delay in convening the BOI,
normally not to exceed 10 calendar days. The respondent must send the request directly to the
legal advisor with copies to the recorder and SCA within 6 calendar days after receiving notice
of the place and date for the hearing. EXCEPTION: The legal advisor may consider a request
submitted more than 6 days after receiving notice of the place and date for the BOI when
denying the request would prejudice the rights of the respondent.
   7.11.1. The legal advisor may grant the delay when denying the request would prejudice the
   rights of the respondent. The legal advisor may grant additional delays after consulting with
   the SCA.
   7.11.2. The legal advisor also considers requests for delay from the Government and may
   grant a delay, normally not to exceed 10 days, as long the delay would not unfairly prejudice
   the rights of the respondent.
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                             37


7.12. Witnesses. The recorder invites witnesses for both the respondent and the government to
appear at the BOI if the legal advisor decides that they are available, their testimony relates to a
significant issue, and the respondent or the government can't adequately present their evidence
any other way. The recorder uses the procedures and policies in Rules for Courts-Martial 703c of
the Manual for Courts-Martial United States, 1984, as a general guide in determining which
witnesses to invite. The recorder may use depositions, affidavits, stipulations, and in-board
telephone calls to obtain testimony of witnesses who can’t testify in person.
   7.12.1. If the board is convened at a place other than the witness’s duty station, the recorder
   asks the SCA concerned to make the military member or Federal employee available. The
   SCA concerned may deny the request if military requirements don’t allow the member or
   employee to appear before the board as a witness. Make witness travel plans in accordance
   with the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR), volume 1 and the JTR, volume 2. If the
   board is convened at the witness’s duty station, the legal advisor may presume that the
   witness is available.
   7.12.2. The recorder will arrange to publish invitational travel orders for witnesses who are
   neither Federal employees nor members of the armed forces in the active military service
   (see Joint Travel Regulation [JTR], volume 2.
       7.12.2.1. The recorder sends a memorandum to the prospective witnesses inviting them
       to appear before the board. See AFI 51-201, Military Justice Guide for funding travel
       orders for witnesses.
   7.12.3. The recorder asks HQ AFPC/DPPRS to determine whether members of other armed
   forces in the active military service and civilian employees of other Federal agencies are
   available to give testimony at BOI hearings.
7.13. Reviewing the Case. The recorder reviews the case before the BOI convenes to decide
which areas may need exploration and explanation at the hearing. The recorder can request
further investigation or more documentation at this time to ensure that the hearing is thorough
and fair. When receiving a documented case, the recorder:
   7.13.1. Obtains facts about the availability of requested and other prospective witnesses.
   7.13.2. Submits the names of requested witnesses (both those requested by the respondent or
   counsel and those that the recorder is requesting to testify for the Government) to the legal
   advisor for a decision in accordance with paragraph 7.12.
   7.13.3. Arranges to publish invitational travel orders based on the legal advisor's decision.
   7.13.4. Gives the respondent or counsel, to the extent permissible, a copy of any records or
   other documentary material not previously furnished the respondent that the recorder
   proposes to offer in evidence at the board hearing.
   7.13.5. Attends any prehearing conference called by the legal advisor, along with the
   respondent and counsel.
   7.13.6. Makes any other necessary preparations for the orderly and proper presentation of
   the case at the board hearing.
   7.13.7. The legal advisor also reviews the file before the BOI convenes and apprises the
   recorder and respondent of any matters that require attention to ensure a fair hearing.
 38                                                                    AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


Section 7B—The Hearing

7.14. Who Conducts Hearings. The president of the BOI presides over the hearings and may
require the recorder to perform administrative duties. Attachment 13 is a sample guide for
conducting the BOI proceedings.
      7.14.1. Although the BOI doesn’t follow strict rules of evidence or the procedures governing
      civilian and military courts, it must adhere to reasonable bounds of relevance, competency,
      and materiality. The board follows AFI 51-602 except when in conflict with this AFI.
   7.14.2. All BOI members must become familiar with this chapter before the board convenes.
   The members must not form a final opinion until the closed session and must be sure that
   they can give a fair and impartial hearing to both parties.
   7.14.3. Voting members may not review the case before the hearing.
   7.14.4. When the board meets in closed session, only the voting members may attend. If the
   board needs the advice of the legal advisor, the board president opens the board to obtain the
   legal advisor’s opinion in open session with the recorder, respondent, and counsel.
   7.14.5. After the board has made a final decision in the case, it may request the legal advisor,
   in closed session, to help draft the findings and recommendations. The reporter enters the
   closed session with the legal advisor, records the proceedings verbatim, and includes them in
   the transcript.
      7.14.6. After the BOI convenes, the legal advisor makes final rulings on:
         7.14.6.1. Procedural matters (including admissibility of proffered evidence, relevance of
         material, presence of witnesses, challenges to the voting members).
         7.14.6.2. Motions, objections, and arguments of counsel.
         7.14.6.3. Any other matter in connection with the conduct of the hearing that requires a
         legal decision.
      7.14.7. The legal advisor instructs the members of the BOI on their duties and
      responsibilities, with the respondent and counsel present.
      7.14.8. The legal advisor has no authority to dismiss an allegation or to terminate the
      proceedings.
7.15. Hospitalized Respondent. If the respondent is hospitalized after the BOI receives the
case, the recorder immediately notifies HQ AFPC/DPPRS and the SCA by message. Summarize
the respondent's condition and estimate when the hospital stay will end.
      7.15.1. The board may not convene or meet while the respondent is hospitalized unless the
      respondent consents, the SCA directs for good cause, or medical authorities determine that
      the respondent no longer requires hospitalization.
7.16. Presence of Respondent, Counsel, or Witnesses. The respondent and counsel have the
right to attend all open sessions of the BOI. Witnesses may be present in the boardroom only
when they are actually testifying. Witnesses waiting to testify may not be present in the
boardroom. The legal advisor decides whether to allow spectators in the boardroom if a
respondent requests spectators at the hearing.
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                            39


7.17. Calling the Board to Order. The president calls each session of the board to order. At
the first session, the recorder places the authority for and the time, date, and place of the hearing
in the record and attaches a copy of the appointing order to the record as an exhibit. At all
sessions, the recorder calls the roll of all voting and non-voting members in the appointing orders
and enters the attendance in the record.
7.18. Recording Presence or Absence of Members, Respondent, and Counsel. The recorder
announces which of the voting and non-voting members are present, and whether the respondent
and counsel are in attendance. The recorder includes the counsel’s name (grade if a member of
the armed services), and address.
7.19. Postponing the Board. If the respondent or counsel is absent, the board determines the
cause. The legal advisor then decides whether to postpone the hearing. When postponing a
hearing, the legal advisor announces when the board will reconvene.
7.20. Explaining Rights to Respondent. The legal advisor advises the respondent of his or her
rights in paragraph 7.3 of this AFI.
7.21. Challenging Voting Members. The respondent and the recorder may challenge voting
members of the board and the legal advisor for cause. The challenging party has the burden of
establishing that the member is not able to participate in a fair and impartial hearing.
   7.21.1. The legal advisor rules on challenges to the voting members and may question the
   challenged member to determine if he or she will judge the case on the evidence, the
   provisions of this AFI, and the instructions of the legal advisor.
   7.21.2. The board rules on challenges to the legal advisor. After hearing evidence on the
   challenge to the legal advisor, the board votes on the challenge in closed session. A secret-
   ballot majority vote must uphold a challenge to the legal advisor. The President of the board
   announces the ruling on the challenge to the legal advisor in open session.
   7.21.3. Voting members are considered qualified and competent if they can:
       7.21.3.1. Follow the legal advisor's instructions.
       7.21.3.2. Reserve judgment until all the evidence is in.
       7.21.3.3. Give sincere consideration to the respondent's evidence in defense and
       mitigation.
       7.21.3.4. Make findings and recommendations on the evidence.
7.22. Oaths. The recorder swears in the legal advisor, reporter, interpreter, and the voting
members. EXCEPTION: The recorder doesn't have to swear in a reporter who has been
administered a one-time oath for court-martial.
   7.22.1. The legal advisor swears in the recorder.
7.23. Opening Statements and Presenting Evidence. The recorder may present the case
against the respondent by documentary evidence, through witnesses, or both. The recorder
presents a verbal resume of the information contained in the documentary evidence. The recorder
also may make an opening statement outlining the allegations, the evidence to support them, and
the conclusions the recorder wishes the board to draw from the evidence. The recorder then
presents evidence and testimony to the board.
 40                                                                     AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


      7.23.1. The respondent may make an opening statement immediately following the
      recorder’s opening statement or at the conclusion of the recorder’s evidence. The respondent
      may then offer evidence in defense, extenuation, or mitigation. Both the recorder and the
      respondent may present evidence in rebuttal, as authorized by the legal advisor.
      7.23.2. The reporter transcribes or describes the contents of any video or audio tapes that the
      recorder or the respondent presents as evidence.
7.24. Examining Witnesses. The recorder, respondent and respondent’s counsel may examine
and cross-examine witnesses to assist the board in making a complete record. If the respondent
chooses to testify under oath, he or she is subject to cross-examination.
   7.24.1. Any member of the BOI and the legal advisor may question witnesses for
   clarification. However, they must refrain from questioning witnesses until the recorder and
   the respondent have finished. The legal advisor only allows questions that are necessary to
   clarify a significant issue bearing on the board’s purpose. Any questions must be relevant to
   the issue before the board.
   7.24.2. The board considers all relevant material, not only the information in the Statement
   of Reasons. The recorder ensures that all information favorable to the respondent that bears
   on the case comes to the attention of the board as a matter of record.
7.25. Accepting Additional Evidence and Amending the Statement of Reasons.
   7.25.1. The recorder may present new or additional evidence received after the SCA refers
   the case to a BOI unless otherwise directed by the SCA.
   7.25.2. The president of the BOI may ask the recorder for additional evidence if the board
   decides that it’s necessary for a full, fair, and impartial evaluation of the case. The new or
   additional evidence may include documentary evidence, statements, or testimony of
   witnesses.
   7.25.3. The legal advisor admits additional evidence that’s relevant, material, and otherwise
   admissible and allows a delay if necessary for the respondent to rebut or respond to new
   evidence.
   7.25.4. The BOI may amend the Statement of Reasons to:
         7.25.4.1. Correct errors.
         7.25.4.2. Ensure it conforms to the evidence (including new or additional evidence).
         7.25.4.3. Add any reasons for the discharge distinct from those already on record.
         7.25.4.4. The president of the BOI informs the parties in open session before making its
         findings, determination, or recommendation that the BOI has amended the Statement of
         Reasons.
         7.25.4.5. If the board amends the Statement of Reasons, it must give the respondent the
         amended Statement of Reasons and allow the respondent additional time, normally not to
         exceed 30 calendar days as determined by the legal advisor, to respond to the amended
         Statement of Reasons. The respondent can waive the right to additional time. In such
         cases the waiver must be included in the record.
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                         41


7.26. Appearance of Witnesses. The recorder administers the oath to each witness who
appears before the board. Relevant statements from persons not present are properly admissible
as evidence. The board calls witnesses as necessary for a full presentation of the entire case.
7.27. Retirement or Resignation Application. If the respondent submits a retirement or
resignation application any time during the proceedings, the BOI continues until it makes its
findings and recommendations.
   7.27.1. If the SCA receives an application after sending the BOI report to HQ
   AFPC/DPPRS, the SCA notifies HQ AFPC/DPPRS by message and sends an information
   copy to the AFPC.
7.28. Examining the Respondent. The respondent may choose to be examined under oath and
subject to cross-examination, or to make an unsworn statement to the board, or to remain silent.
The board may not draw any adverse inference from the respondent’s choice to remain silent, or
to make an unsworn statement.
   7.28.1. The legal advisor must advise the respondent of his or her rights under Article 31,
   UCMJ.
7.29. Deliberations. After the respondent or counsel presents closing arguments, the legal
advisor gives instructions to the board, as necessary. The board then enters closed session,
attended only by voting members.
   7.29.1. The board:
       7.29.1.1. Must judge the case on its own merits.
       7.29.1.2. Must judge the facts in light of the instructions given by the legal advisor, and
       the standard of conduct or performance of duty expected of an officer of the respondent's
       grade and experience.
       7.29.1.3. Must ensure its findings are supported by a preponderance of the evidence.
       7.29.1.4. Must weigh all the evidence and arrive at their findings by a preponderance of
       the evidence. A preponderance of evidence is that evidence which, when fairly
       considered, produces the stronger impression, has the greater weight, and is more
       convincing as to its truth when weighed against any evidence in opposition to it.
   7.29.2. Legal Assistance. If the board must seek advice of the legal advisor during the
   deliberations, the board president opens the board and obtains the advice in open session with
   the reporter, recorder, respondent, and counsel present and makes these proceedings a part of
   the record.
   7.29.3. Review Proceedings. The board in its deliberations may review any phase of the
   proceedings, including recalling witnesses. The board president:
       7.29.3.1. Determines whether the voting members should review particular parts of the
       hearing.
       7.29.3.2. Determines whether to open the board to review the recorded testimony and, or
       to recall witnesses for re-examination.
       7.29.3.3. Makes the review proceedings a part of the record.
 42                                                                   AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


7.30. Specific Findings. The board makes its findings by the majority vote of a secret written
ballot. The board must make a separate specific finding on each allegation contained in the
Statement of Reasons. If a majority doesn't conclude that a preponderance of credible evidence
supports an allegation, the board decides the finding in the respondent's favor.
   7.30.1. DELETED
   7.30.2. DELETED
   7.30.3. If a respondent disputes a debt for education assistance funds, the board must make
   findings and recommendations concerning the validity of the indebtedness. See paragraph
   4.32 for special rules regarding recoupment.
7.31. Recommendations. Once the board has completed its findings, it determines whether the
respondent should be retained on active duty and makes a recommendation on the case. Findings
that make the respondent subject to removal from active duty or discharge do not prevent the
board from recommending retention. However, there must be at least one finding making the
respondent subject to removal from active duty or discharge before the board may recommend
such removal or discharge. The board may make only one of the specific recommendations in
paragraphs 7.31.1 through 7.31.4. The board reaches its decisions by the majority vote of a
secret ballot.
   7.31.1. Retention. The board recommends retaining the respondent when it determines that
   the respondent should be retained on active duty.
   7.31.2. Respondent Not Eligible to Retire. When the board determines that the respondent
   should not be retained on active duty, the board recommends:
       7.31.2.1. Removing the respondent from active duty if the respondent is a regular officer.
       7.31.2.2. Discharging the respondent if the respondent is a reserve officer.
          7.31.2.2.1. When the board recommends removal from active duty or discharge, the
          board:
          7.31.2.2.2. Recommends an honorable or under honorable conditions (general)
          discharge if the basis for discharge falls solely under Chapter 2.
          7.31.2.2.3. Recommends an honorable discharge if the basis falls solely under
          Chapter 3 for precommissioning activities not involving intentional
          misrepresentation or omission of facts in official documents.
          7.31.2.2.4. May recommend an honorable discharge, a discharge under honorable
          conditions (general) or an UOTHC discharge in all other cases with a basis for
          discharge under Chapter 3.
   7.31.3. Respondent is a Regular officer and Eligible to Retire. When the board determines
   that the respondent should not be retained on active duty, it recommends removal from active
   duty and retirement.
   7.31.4. Respondent is a Reserve Officer and Eligible to Retire. When the board determines
   that the respondent should not be retained on active duty, it recommends retirement if the
   respondent applied for voluntary retirement. If the respondent hasn’t applied for voluntary
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                         43


   retirement, the board recommends discharge and the character of discharge (see paragraph
   7.31.2).
7.32. Announcing Results. The board president announces the results of the ballot to the board
members immediately after collecting and counting the votes. The board president may ask the
legal advisor and reporter to help in preparing the board’s findings and recommendations in
proper form. The respondent, the counsel, and the recorder may not be present.
   7.32.1. After announcing the results to the closed session, the president opens the board and
   announces the findings and recommendations of the board in open session to the respondent.
   7.32.2. The reporter transcribes the proceedings of both sessions as part of the record.
   7.32.3. If the board retains the respondent, the board president advises the respondent of this
   decision in writing and sends an information copy to HQ AFPC/DPPRS and the SCA.

Section 7C—Post-BOI Administrative Functions

7.33. Preparing BOI Report. The reporter normally completes the report within 30 calendar
days after the BOI adjourns. The report contains the board proceedings verbatim, except as

   findings and recommendations are recorded verbatim.
       7.33.1.1. Board members sign the report to certify that a majority of the voting members
       concurred in the findings and recommendations. Members who don't concur may file a
       statement and explanation for inclusion in the case record.

       page: "The above signatures certify that the findings and recommendations of this board
       represent a majority opinion of the board."
   7.33.2. Authentication. The legal advisor authenticates the BOI report. When the legal
   advisor isn't available, the board president and the recorder authenticate the report and
   explain why the substitution was necessary.
   7.33.3. Summarizing Proceedings. When the BOI retains the respondent on active duty, the
   reporter transcribes the findings and recommendations verbatim and summarizes the record
   of the board proceedings. The legal office must keep the tapes of the record of the board
   proceedings for 1 year, so that it can transcribe them again, if necessary.
7.34. Distributing the BOI Report.
   7.34.1. The legal office gives the respondent:
       7.34.1.1. An authenticated copy of the BOI report.
       7.34.1.2. Any unclassified extract of a classified board report.
       7.34.1.3. Access to the classified portion according to AFI 31-601.
   7.34.2. After obtaining a signed and dated receipt for the BOI report, the legal office
   addresses the report transmittal memorandum to the SCA. The legal office sends:

      7.34.4. HQ AFPC/DPPRS sends the BOI case to the AFPC through HQ USAF/JAG when a
      BOI doesn't retain the officer on active duty.
      7.34.5. HQ AFPC/DPPRS retains a BOI case for 1 year when the BOI retains an officer on
      active duty. HQ AFPC/DPPRS destroys the case file after 1 year.
7.35. Action by Respondent. If the BOI recommends that the officer be removed from active
duty or discharged, the respondent may take these actions within 10 calendar days after receiving
or having access to an authenticated copy of the BOI report:
      7.35.1. File with the legal advisor any suggested corrections to the report. The legal advisor
      determines what corrections are allowable and advises the respondent or counsel accordingly.
   7.35.2. Send to the SCA any brief or argument assigning error or raising new matters.
   7.35.3. Submit to the SCA additional evidence that could materially affect the BOI's findings
   and recommendations, provided such evidence was not reasonably available for presentation
   to the board during its hearings.
   7.35.4. Request a delay in taking one or more of these actions. NOTE: The respondent must
   provide reasons for requesting the delay. The SCA may grant such delay if satisfied that
   denying the request would compromise the officer's rights.
7.36. Action by SCA on BOI Report.

   that he or she may request excess leave pending final decision in the case.
7.37. Reconvening the BOI. This applies when a BOI recommends removal from active duty
or discharge. The SCA may reconvene the board any time before the SAF makes a final decision
when the SCA receives evidence that could materially affect its findings and recommendations.
The SCA must establish that this evidence was not reasonably available for presentation during
the board hearings. New evidence includes conduct after the BOI adjourns.

If you have made an unrestricted report of sexual assault within the last 12 months and believe
your commander’s recommendation for this involuntary separation action was made in
retaliation for making that report, you have the right to request review of the circumstances of
this involuntary separation action. If you request this review, I will review the circumstances of,
and grounds for, the recommendation for involuntary separation to ensure it was not initiated in
retaliation for making the report.

Familiarize yourself with AFI 36-3206, particularly the rights that you have. If you do not apply
for retirement or request a resignation in lieu of further administrative action, a board (AFPB or
BOI) will convene as provided in Chapter 6 or Chapter 7. Contact (grade, name, telephone
number, and office address of the area defense counsel) to discuss the procedures involved and
your rights and options. If you decline counsel, contact (grade, name, telephone number, and

office address of the chief, Military Personnel Flight) for counseling about your rights and
options.

If you elect to present matters to a BOI, the standard of proof used by the board to make findings
is a preponderance of evidence. You may present evidence and argument to rebut the [reason]
[reasons] set forth in this notification memorandum or any additional reason or information
developed during the BOI proceedings. You also may present other pertinent evidence.

Within l0 calendar days after you receive this notification memorandum, you must respond by
indorsement to me. If I do not receive the indorsement within the allotted time I will proceed
with further action under AFI 36-3206. Include in your indorsement:

a. Any statement you wish to submit on your own behalf and/or any additional evidence that you
wish me to consider. If you are unable to submit your statements or documentary evidence
within 10 calendar days after receiving this notification memorandum, you may request more
time as allowed under AFI 36-3206. Submit your request for additional time to (the SCA or if the
SCA has delegated, to his or her designee under paragraph 4.22.1.). If you do not submit
statements or evidence, your failure will constitute a waiver of your right to do so, and I will
refer your case to the (BOI or AFPB).

b. A statement that (grade, name and of the area defense counsel) counseled you and that you
fully understand your rights and options in this action. If you declined counsel, so state and
indicate that (grade, name, chief, Military Personnel Flight) counseled you and that you fully

c. A statement that you understand the following regarding recoupment of education assistance,
special pay, or bonuses received if you haven’t completed the period of active duty you agreed to
serve:

Recoupment of a portion of education assistance, special pay, or bonus monies received if you
voluntarily separate.

Recoupment of a portion of education assistance received if involuntary discharge is for
misconduct.

Recoupment of a portion of special pay or bonus monies received regardless of the basis for
involuntary discharge.]

Recoupment of education assistance, special pay, or bonus money received if a discharge under
other than honorable conditions (UOTHC) is authorized. This is the case whether or not you are
actually discharged UOTHC or actually convicted under the UCMJ.

The recoupment in all cases is an amount that bears the same ratio to the total amount or cost
provided to you as the unserved portion of active duty bears to the total period of active duty that
you agreed to serve. (Include the following bullet if the officer is subject to recoupment of
education assistance costs.)
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                               57

not choose or are not entitled to a board of inquiry, an authority appointed by the MAJCOM/CC,
will make findings and recommendations concerning the validity of your indebtedness. See AFI
36-3206, 4.32. and 4.33., regarding special rules for recoupment.]

resignation. If you have applied for retirement or tendered your resignation, attach a copy of the
retirement application or the resignation.

choosing, if reasonably available. Civilian counsel may represent you at your own expense.

        You also may request that the SCA postpone convening of the board if you need more
time to prepare your case. If the SCA approves your request, the SCA will set a new date for the
hearing. However, if you do not request a later date and you do not appear at the time and place
specified for the hearing, the board will consider your case on the complete file in your absence.

LA: At any time before a final decision is made by the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) on your
case you may apply for separation. (NOTE: Refer to "Secretary of the Air Force" instead of the
abbreviated form "SAF" during the hearing.)

If you are eligible to retire, you may apply for voluntary retirement with the understanding that
you may be retired on the first day of the month, or no later than the first day of the second
month, immediately following the SAF’s approval of your application. If the SAF determines
that you did not hold the higher grade satisfactorily, you may be retired in a grade lower than
your current grade. If you are not eligible to retire voluntarily, you may apply for a discharge, to
be effective within 10 calendar days [20 calendar days if serving overseas] following notification
of approval by the SAF.

[If and when you apply for retirement or discharge, these proceedings will continue until the
findings and recommendations have been reached.] [Although you are awaiting SAF approval on
your [retirement] [discharge], (enter the name of the show-cause authority) has directed that this
BOI convene. The proceedings will continue until the findings and recommendations have been
reached.]
 74                                                                    AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


LA: You may be represented by military or civilian counsel and you may appear in person, with
or without counsel at all open proceedings of the board. If you can’t be present or you waive
your right to be present, you must be represented by counsel. The Air Force may designate
counsel or you may request a qualified counsel who is an Air Force officer and reasonably
available. You may be represented by either designated or requested military counsel, but
normally not by both. You may retain civilian counsel at no expense to the Government. Civilian
counsel may represent you alone or along with your military counsel.

 Unless you waive the requirement, your military counsel must have equal qualification and
certification under Article 27(b)(2), UCMJ, with a recorder qualified under that article. [As you
heard earlier, your military counsel meets this requirement.]

If you do not appear in person and are not represented by a lawyer, the major commander will
appoint a military lawyer to represent you.

LA: Do you understand your rights to counsel?

RESP: [Yes] [No]. (NOTE: LA explains rights to counsel until RESP understands them.)

LA: You may arrange for the appearance of witnesses whose testimony you believe is pertinent
to your case. You may also request the recorder to have invitational travel orders issued to
witnesses who meet the requirements of AFI 36-3206, Chapter 7. This board may not authorize
Government payment of the expenses of witnesses who are not invited to appear by the recorder.

LA: You may submit depositions, sworn or unsworn statements, certificates, affidavits,
stipulations or other evidence for consideration by the BOI, whether or not you appear in person.
You may also submit a written brief covering any phase of the case at any time before the BOI
convenes, during its proceedings, or no later than 10 calendar days after receiving or having
access to a copy of the authenticated transcript of these hearings (as provided in AFI 36-3206,
Chapter 7).

LA: You may challenge, for cause only, any voting member of the board or me, the appointed
legal advisor.

LA: You or your counsel may question any witness brought before the board.

LA: All rights under Article 31, UCMJ, are extended to you. Article 31 provides that:

No person subject to the UCMJ may compel any person to incriminate himself or herself or to
answer any question that may be self-incriminating.

No person subject to the UCMJ may interrogate or request any statement from an accused or a
person suspected of an offense without first stating the nature of the accusation and advising the
person that he or she does not have to make any statement regarding the offense and that any
statement may be used as evidence in a trial by court-martial.
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                            75


No person subject to the UCMJ may compel any person to make a statement or produce evidence
before any military tribunal if the statement or evidence is not material to the issue and may be
degrading.

No statement obtained from any person in violation of Article 31, or through the use of coercion,
unlawful influence, or unlawful inducement shall be received in evidence against him in a trial
by court-martial.

LA: Do you understand your rights under Article 31, UCMJ?

RESP: [Yes] [No].(NOTE: LA explains rights under Article 31, UCMJ, until RESP understands
them.)

LA: During the hearing, you may submit to an examination by the board if you wish. You will be
sworn as a witness and subject to cross-examination just as any other witness before this board.

LA: If you do not desire to make a statement under oath, you may make a statement to the board
without taking an oath, either personally or through your counsel, orally, in writing or in any
combination of those ways. If you do not make a statement under oath, you will not be subject to
cross-examination, but other evidence may be offered to rebut the facts and representations made
in your statement.

LA: You will be furnished copies of any records that I, as the legal advisor to the board, consider
relevant to the case at any time during the board proceedings.

LA: You will be furnished a copy of the record of this BOI. After you have been notified of the
decision by the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, you may request a copy of the report of
the Board of Review, unless the report is classified, by writing to the National Personnel Records
Center, 9700 Page Blvd, St Louis, MO 63132-5100.

LA: Do you understand your rights in these proceedings?

RESP: [I do.] [I do not.] (LA explains RESP’s rights in these proceedings until RESP
understands them.)

LA: If you have any questions as to your rights at any point in these proceedings, feel free to
consult with your counsel, or ask me.

4. Presentation of Government Exhibits.

(If the recorder presents video or audio tapes as Government exhibits, the reporter transcribes or
describes the contents of the tapes.)

LA: The recorder may proceed.
 76                                                                   AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


REC: I have marked as Government Exhibit 3 the Statement of Reasons (and supporting
documentation). (Documents may be individually marked or grouped as appropriate.) Also
included is the show-cause authority’s notification memorandum to (RESP) advising the
respondent to show cause for retention in the Air Force, with the respondent’s indorsement. This
exhibit indicates that the respondent received this memorandum on (date) _________, which is
more than 30 days prior to today’s date.

REC: Exhibit 3 shows that the respondent has received the Statement of Reasons and supporting
documents as attachments to the notification memorandum.

REC: Government Exhibit 3 is offered into evidence. A copy has been provided to the
respondent.

(NOTE: Exhibit 3 includes only those records and supporting documents that have already been
given to RESP. Records and supporting documents need not appear more than once in the
record.)

LA: Is there any objection by the respondent?

RC: [No] [Yes]. (NOTE: LA doesn’t proceed until resolving any objection.)

LA: Government Exhibit 3 [is] [is not] admitted into evidence.

REC: (Introduce other documentary evidence relating to the BOI and mark as Government
Exhibit 4 as appropriate. Briefly describe each document. (NOTE: Make sure that all evidence is
logically grouped, legible, and clearly marked on every page.)

LA: Is there any objection by respondent?

RC: [No] [Yes]. (NOTE: LA doesn’t proceed until resolving any objection.)

LA: Government Exhibit 4 [is] [is not] admitted into evidence.

LA: (If documents are admitted into evidence that the Air Force didn’t previously refer to the
RESP.) [I note that documents that were not previously referred to the respondent have been
admitted into evidence.

Does the respondent wish to request additional time, normally not to exceed 10 calendar days, in
which to prepare? If you request additional time, you must show why the additional time is
required. If you do not desire additional time or if I determine that your request for additional
time is not required, this board will proceed. Please indicate at this time if you are prepared to
proceed or if you need additional time to prepare your case.

RC: [Respondent is prepared to proceed.] [Respondent requests ___ calendar days to prepare
[his] [her] case.]
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                          77


LA: [The BOI convening date will be reset to allow the respondent to prepare a response to the
additional documentary evidence.] [Respondent’s request for additional time is not granted. (LA
gives reasons for not granting additional time.) We will proceed.]

LA: Does the respondent have any exhibits to offer or other matters requiring ruling at this time?

RC: [No] [Yes]. (LA proceeds to address exhibits offered or to rule on other matters.)

(NOTE: This is the appropriate time to address board membership (regular/reserve officers),
board procedural overview, voir dire procedures, challenges, instructions to board MBRs, and so
forth.)

LA: Are there any further matters before we adjourn this preboard session?

LA: We will adjourn in a moment. When we resume, with the members present, I will instruct
the members and conduct a brief voir dire. Then, both the recorder and the respondent’s counsel
may conduct a brief voir dire of the board members, if they desire. Before I ask about challenges,
I’ll ask if either side wishes an out-of-board hearing. Each side will also have the opportunity to
make an opening statement. After both sides have rested, we will have an out-of-board hearing
to discuss the legal instructions. Closing arguments will begin with the recorder, who will then
be followed by the respondent’s counsel. The recorder will have an opportunity to make a brief
rebuttal if desired. I ask counsel to remember that this is an administrative proceeding and not a
court-martial. Therefore, don’t refer to the respondent as the "accused" or the "defendant" or
refer to me as "your honor." Address me as "Mr.(or MS) Legal Advisor."

LA: The pre-board hearing is adjourned. The BOI will convene [when the members are present]
[at_________ hours, on (date)__________].

 (NOTE: Recesses and Adjournments. Generally the board recesses for a period less than one
day or for periods not extending into the succeeding day. The legal advisor usually calls
adjournments to continue the session the following day or at a specified later date. Consider this
suggested procedure:)

LA: (addresses the session) The board will now [recess] [adjourn] and will reconvene at
_________hours, ___________. (The recorder enters into the record the time for recess or
adjournment and time and date of reconvening.)

(NOTE: Procedure for Adding Allegations to the Statement of Reasons. A recorder or the board
may propose to add a new allegation to the existing Statement of Reasons at any time during the
BOI proceedings when it becomes evident that such addition is proper. If the recorder raises the
issue, the usual procedure is for the recorder, as the representative of the Government, to advance
the request and present the proposed addition to the Statement of Reasons as an exhibit for
adoption. If members of the BOI raise new allegations on their own motion, the board requests
the recorder to prepare a draft of the amendment to the Statement of Reasons. The following or
similar procedure is appropriate:)
 78                                                                   AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


[REC: I believe that the board should consider adding a new allegation to the Statement of
Reasons because of evidence received at this proceeding. This evidence is adverse to the
respondent in that it tends to indicate another reason to consider separating the respondent from
the Air Force. I have drafted a proposed additional Statement of Reason and now hand it to the
legal advisor as proposed Exhibit ______________.]

(At this time the recorder moves that the board amend the Statement of Reasons to include an
additional allegation. For example:)

REC: The evidence received by this board tends to substantiate that the respondent
misrepresented material facts in an official document. Specifically included with exhibit 3, which
has already been submitted into evidence before this board, is a letter dated 28 June 1979 signed
by the respondent, to the effect that "I have liquidated all of my bills as of this date." However,
other testimony before this board (or offered to this board) clearly shows that as of 28 June 1979
and since, the respondent still owes $45 to Archer’s of San Antonio, Texas; $50 to Harry’s
Variety Store of Arlington, Virginia; and $75 to the First Citizens Bank of Wall Street, Virginia;
and that as of 28 June 1979, and since, those debts were delinquent. To support this mission, I
offer as Exhibit ______, a sample additional Statement of Reasons that incorporates the
allegations outlined above.

LA: The recorder’s motion is granted. Exhibit _______ is accepted into evidence and the
Statement of Reasons is so amended.

LA (to RESP): You may be entitled to no more than 30 calendar days from the present time
within which to prepare your defense to this additional Statement of Reason. While you may be
entitled to this time, I urge you to prepare promptly. With your agreement, the board will
continue further proceeding now. Do you agree to continue the hearing or do you want to
request a delay to prepare your case.

RC: _________________. [The respondent is prepared to proceed at this time and waives further
delay with respect to this additional Statement of Reason.] [The respondent requests __________
days (not in excess of 30 calendar days) delay for preparation of case.

LA: [Respondent may present any evidence on the additional Statement of Reason as desired.] or
[The board will recess until ________ hours, ________ 19____.]

(The board reconvenes at the designated time and date. The LA opens the session.)

LA: The Board is open.

REC: Let the record show that the board adjourned at ________ hours, ____________ 19 ___
and reconvened at __________, hours, _____________ 19____, and that all parties who were
present when the board adjourned are again present.

LA: Is the respondent prepared to present a defense to the additional Statement of Reason?
RC: The respondent is prepared to proceed.
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                          79


(Each sides introduces testimony in accordance with the usual procedures.)

5. Convening of BOI with Members.

LA: The president may call the board to order.

PRES: The board will come to order.

REC: This board is convened at (time)_________ hours, on (date)___________, at
(place)___________________ pursuant to Special Order A_______ , dated ______,
Headquarters (SCA)______. The appointing order has been previously admitted as Government
Exhibit 1 and I have distributed copies to each member of the board, the legal advisor,
respondent’s counsel, and the reporter.

The board is convened to determine whether the respondent, (grade & full name)
_______________________, should be retained in the Air Force.

LA: Would each member of the board examine the appointing order to ensure their names and
identifying information is correct?

REC: The following persons, including all voting members of the board are present:

President (PRES): ______________, [regular] [reserve] Officer

Member (MBR): _______________, [regular] [reserve] [ANG] Officer

Member (MBR): _______________, [regular] [reserve] [ANG] Officer

(NOTE: If the respondent is a regular officer, all the voting members must be regular officers. If
the respondent is a reserve officer, at least one voting member must be a reserve or ANG
officer.)

Legal Advisor (LA): ____________________

Recorder(s) (REC): _____________________

Respondent (RESP): ____________________

Respondent’s counsel (RC): ______________

Reporter (REP): ________________________

(NOTE: Identify civilian counsel by full name, office address and bar membership(s).)
REC: [No] [The following] members of the board are absent: The voting members have been
provided a copy of AFI 36-3206 and a copy of the directive that governs boards of officers.
 80                                                                     AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


REC: No witnesses who will appear before this board are present in the hearing room. [There are
no spectators in the hearing room.] [The spectators are present at the request of the respondent.]

REC: The respondent is junior in grade and rank to all voting members designated in the
appointing orders. [The respondent is a reserve officer; therefore, at least one voting member is a
reserve officer.] The Air Force notified the respondent of this hearing on (date)_______. The
respondent’s written acknowledgment of that notice is dated (date)_________. The board has
previously admitted the notice and acknowledgment as Government Exhibit 2. A preboard
session was held at (hours) ______ on (date)_____________. This is the initial board session
with the voting members present.

6. Board Members Sworn.

LA: The board will now be sworn. All rise, please.

REC: As I call your name, please raise your right hand. Do you, (grade & last name), [solemnly
swear so help you God] (or) [affirm] that you will truthfully answer all questions about your
ability to be an impartial member of this board, and that you will determine, according to the
evidence and without partiality, favor or affection, the case about to be heard by this BOI of
which you are members?

MBRS: I do.

LA: Please be seated. Members of the board, you have been appointed as members of a BOI
under AFI 36-3206 to consider the case of (grade & full name)______________. [He] [She] has
been recommended for discharge because of the allegations in the Statement of Reasons [and the
additional Statement of Reasons] contained in Government Exhibit 3 [and Government Exhibit
4], which the recorder will now distribute.

REC: Yes, sir. (Distributes copies of Government Exhibit 3 [and Government Exhibit 4] to
MBRs.)

LA: Members, please find the Statement of Reasons [and the additional Statement of Reasons] in
Government Exhibit 3 [and Government Exhibit 4]. Take a few minutes at this time to examine
the Statement of Reasons and to place my instructions and the rest of the proceedings in proper
context.

7. Preliminary Instructions.
LA: (After the board MBRs review the statement of reasons.) Before we proceed, I will give you
some preliminary instructions. First, I will address the responsibilities of various personnel of the
board. Next I will cover some basic concepts and principles that govern the proceedings.
Finally, I will highlight the procedural and evidentiary rules that this hearing will follow.

LA: You have been appointed as a member of a BOI under AFI 36-3206 to consider the case of
(RESP’s grade & full name) ________________. [He] [She] has been recommended for
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                              81


discharge because of the allegations in the Statement of Reasons that the recorder has distributed
to you.

LA: As Board members, you must be attentive and keep an open mind while the evidence,
arguments, and guidance are being presented. It is important that you understand the functions
and duties of a BOI as they are outlined in AFI 36-3206, Chapter 7.

LA: First, the following individuals have certain responsibilities to this board. The recorder will
represent the United States Air Force, and the respondent’s counsel will represent the
Respondent. At various points during the proceedings, counsel are permitted to present
arguments or statements for your consideration. Those arguments and statements are not
evidence, but they may assist you in forming your view of the evidence, and in discharging your
duties.

LA: As legal advisor, it is my responsibility to ensure that the proceedings are fair, orderly, and
impartial. I will instruct you on the law and rule on the admissibility of all evidence and on
motions or objections by counsel. You must follow the law as I interpret it for you.

LA: During the course of the proceedings, I may need to recess the board or conduct hearings
with counsel and the respondent, out of your presence. I will try to estimate the time required for
these hearings, but such estimates are not always accurate. Your patience and understanding will
contribute greatly to a climate of fairness. During recesses, you must refrain from discussing the
case among yourselves or with others. You must restrict your deliberations to the closed session,
after presentation of all evidence, arguments by counsel, and my instructions on the law. Further,
because of the possible appearance of impropriety, you must avoid off-the-record
communications with me, counsel, the respondent, or any potential witness.

LA: During the hearing, you may consider it necessary to question a witness after both sides
have completed their examination. Exercise caution when asking questions and be aware that
counsel for both sides have prepared their cases. Often a question that occurs to you was not
asked for a specific reason or will be best answered by a subsequent witness. If after due
consideration, you wish to ask a question, you must submit it to me in writing. If the question is
permissible, I will direct the witness to answer it, or I may pose specific questions to elicit the
information you desire. Bear in mind that the questions you ask are subject to objection by
counsel for either side. If there is an objection regardless of my ruling, you must not let it reflect
adversely on the side that raised it.

LA: Because you must find facts based upon the evidence in order to reach your decision, you
may wish to take notes. I must caution you, however, that no member may regard another
member’s notes as evidence. Retain your notes for your personal use only, to refresh your
recollection of the testimony. At the end of the hearing, destroy them.]

LA: As you take notes, be sure that you still observe the witnesses, because you are required to
assess their credibility. In judging the credibility of a witness, you must consider all the
circumstances under which the witness testifies; the witness’s demeanor and manner on the
stand; the acuteness of the witness’s powers of observation; the accuracy and extent of the
 82                                                                     AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


witness’s memory; the witness’s interest, if any, in the outcome of the case; and any other
circumstances that tend to shed light on the witness’s credibility, taking into account your own
experience in dealing with people.

LA: With regard to your fact-finding responsibility, let me emphasize that this board is not a
judicial tribunal. Accordingly, this hearing is not subject to the rules and procedures that govern
civilian or military courts. For example, the rules of evidence are greatly relaxed, and it is not
necessary that the allegations in the Statement of Reasons [or in the additional Statement of
Reasons] be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

LA: Administrative boards must weigh all the evidence and arrive at their findings by a
preponderance of the evidence. A preponderance of evidence is that evidence which, when fairly
considered, produces the stronger impression, has the greater weight, and is more convincing as
to its truth when weighed against any evidence opposition to it.

LA: Additionally, I caution you that the function of the BOI is not limited to considering the
information in the Statement of Reasons [or in the additional Statement of Reasons] as it has
been presented to you.

LA: The duties of the BOI are specific: First, to receive evidence during the proceedings; second,
to develop any additional information, as needed, to create a record on which to base a proper
decision; third, to evaluate evidence received during the hearing; fourth, to arrive at clear, logical
findings consistent with the evidence presented; and fifth, to make a determination and
recommendations consistent with the finding(s).

LA: As a member of this board, you must follow the guidance in AFI 36-3206, Chapter 7. In
addition, you must protect (grade & last name)_________________’s rights, and give [him]
[her] a fair and impartial hearing. At the same time, however, you must remember that the Air
Force is also a party to the hearing and is entitled to a fair and impartial hearing of its evidence.
An officer who fails to meet and maintain the standards expected of an officer of the
respondent’s grade and experience should not be retained in the Air Force. However, it would be
a grave injustice to the officer and contrary to the best interests of the Air Force to remove from
active duty an officer who should be retained.

LA: It is your duty to weigh all the evidence and arrive at findings that are supported by the
preponderance of the evidence. Based on your findings, the board must then determine whether
the respondent should be retained in the Air Force. The board is limited to the specific
recommendations stated in AFI 36-3206, chapter 7, without modification or qualification. The
board is not authorized to make any other recommendation or proviso to any of the possible
recommendations.

(NOTE: Include the following if the respondent is subject to recoupment of education assistance,
special pay or bonus money.)

[LA: You’ll need to refer to AFI 36-3206, paragraph 4.32., Recoupment of Education
Assistance, Special Pay, or Bonuses, for special rules regarding recoupment. If the respondent is
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                              83


subject to recoupment of education assistance and disputes the debt, you must make findings and
recommendations concerning the validity of the indebtedness.]

8. Procedural Overview.

LA: Let me now turn to an overview of the procedures that we will use in this BOI. In a few
minutes, counsel and I will ask you some questions to determine if any grounds for challenge
exist against any of you. Please keep in mind that none of us intend these questions to embarrass
you or to question your integrity. We ask them only to ensure that the respondent as well as the
Air Force receive a hearing by fair and impartial voting members.

LA: You may be questioned individually or collectively, but you should respond individually. If
you feel that you have to say something that might prejudice or disqualify any other member
who hear your answer, tell me and I’ll ensure that you’ll be asked any pertinent questions out of
the presence of the other members.

LA: Once we determine the final membership of the board, the recorder and the respondent’s
counsel will be permitted to make opening statements. At this time, I’ll give you any documents
and additional information that I admitted as evidence at a preliminary session conducted out of
your presence.

LA: We will then recess the board to allow you to read those documents. After you read the
documents, witnesses may be called. During the recess you should simply read the documentary
evidence and absorb the information. You must not begin deliberating or otherwise discuss the
case in any manner either among yourselves or with any other person.

LA: After the presentation of all evidence, the recorder and the respondent’s counsel may make
closing argument to aid you in evaluating the evidence. I will then give you final instructions
before you go into your deliberations.

LA: You will vote by secret written ballot. A majority vote is required to arrive at the findings
and recommendations for disposition of the case. After the board adjourns, no member may
disclose the vote or position of any other member. A member may disclose his or her own vote
but may not be required to do so by anyone.

(NOTE: Omit the following instructions and go to part 9, "Voir Dire Procedure" if the board’s
determination may only result in an honorable discharge recommendation as specified as
specified in AFI 36-3206.)
 84                                                                     AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


LA: Here is a concise summary of the rights and benefits associated with each character of
discharge that the Air Force may give an officer after the BOI determines that he or she
shouldn’t be retained:

Honorable Discharge: The board may recommend this discharge when the military record of the
respondent warrants the highest type of discharge. As a rule, the officer is entitled to full rights
and benefits but is ineligible to reenter the Service as an enlisted member.

Discharge Under Honorable Conditions (General): The board may recommend this discharge
when the military record of the respondent is not sufficiently meritorious to warrant an honorable
discharge but is not of such a nature that a discharge under other than honorable conditions is
warranted. Usually, the respondent is entitled to full rights and benefits. If present or future
statutes specifically require honorable discharge as a condition of granting rights and benefits,
the officer’s eligibility for these rights or benefits may be affected. The officer is ineligible to
reenter the Service as an enlisted member.

Discharge Under Other Than Honorable Conditions: The board may recommend this discharge
when the military record of the respondent does not warrant other than the least desirable
administrative discharge. An officer who receives this type of discharge may not receive certain
benefits as determined by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and is ineligible to reenter the
Service as an enlisted member.

9. Voir Dire Procedure.

LA: Members of the board, at this time I will direct some general questions to you about your
qualifications to serve as a member of this BOI.

LA: Does any member write or indorse the officer performance report of any other member of
this BOI?

LA: Have each of you familiarized yourself with AFI 36-3206, Chapter 7?

LA: Does any member know the respondent?

LA: Do any of you know anything about the matters in the Statement of Reasons?

LA: Have any of you had any prior participation in this case?

LA: Is your acquaintance with any of the counsel such as might influence your deliberation or
vote in this case?

LA: Will you each give a fair and impartial hearing to both parties and base your decision solely
on the evidence, and not form a final opinion until you enter your closed session deliberations?

LA: The recorder may question the voting members, if desired.
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                           85


LA: The respondent’s counsel may question the voting members, if desired.

LA: Does the respondent’s counsel desire an out-of-board hearing?

RC: [No] [Yes]. (If yes, the LA adjourns the BOI hearing, holds an out-of-board hearing, and
then reconvenes the BOI hearing to continue with part 10.)

10. Hearing Challenges.

(NOTE: The legal advisor hears challenges to voting members of the board outside their
presence. The respondent, the respondent’s counsel, or the recorder may challenge voting
members of the board for cause based upon matters raised in voir dire, or upon evidence or
testimony. After the respondent’s counsel and the recorder have had opportunity to present
evidence and argument, the legal advisor rules on the challenge. If the voting membership drops
below quorum, the president adjourns the board until new members are appointed. Voir dire and
the right to challenge new members for cause will be extended when the board resumes. If the
basis for a sustained challenge develops at a later stage of the proceedings, any new members
must be read the record of the proceedings-to-date in open session, in the presence of all parties.
When challenging witnesses, including the respondent, the order of questioning is the
respondent’s counsel, the recorder, voting members of the board, and the legal advisor. All
persons testifying on a challenge will be sworn as witnesses but questions are limited to the
ground for challenge.)

LA: Does the respondent desire to challenge any voting member for cause?

RC: [No] [Yes]. (After the RC argues, the REC may be allowed to argue.)

LA: The challenge of (MBR’s grade & full name) is [sustained] [denied]. [The member is
permanently excused from further participation in this case. The board is adjourned until a new
member is available.]

REC: Does the respondent desire to challenge the legal advisor for cause?

RC: [No] [Yes]. (If yes, the RC has the opportunity to voir dire the LA in the presence of the
members.)

(NOTE: The board votes on a challenge to the LA in closed session and the PRES announces the
board’s ruling in open session.)

PRES: The challenge of (LA’s grade & full name) is [sustained] [denied]. [The legal advisor is
permanently excused from further participation in this case. The board is adjourned until a new
legal advisor is available.]

RC: The respondent has no [further] challenges.

opportunity.

RC: (Makes or defers opening statement). (NOTE: The RESP may present documentary
evidence to board MBRs at this time so they can review it during the following recess.)

LA: At this time, the board will recess so that the members may familiarize themselves with the
documentary evidence. Please remember that you are not to begin deliberations at this time. Tell
me when you are finished reviewing the documents. The board is in recess.

12. Recess/Proceedings Resumed.

LA: Please be seated. The board will come to order. All parties are present.

13. Witness Procedure.

LA: (After both side present all evidence.) Do the members want to recall any witness or have
additional witnesses called, or want any additional documentary evidence, Mr. President?

PRES: [No] [Yes]. (If yes, procedures already outlined apply.)

14. Out-of-Board Hearing.

LA: Members of the board, I will need a hearing with the respondent and counsel, out of your
presence, to discuss my legal instructions and the Findings and Recommendations Worksheet we
will be giving to you. I estimate that we will be in recess [for about _____ minutes] [until _____
hours]. I remind you not to begin deliberating until your closed session, after the argument by
counsel, and my instructions on the law. The board is in recess. (NOTE: During the recess the

LA goes over the instructions he or she intends to give with the Findings and Recommendations
Worksheet. The LA must modify the worksheet to be consistent with evidence admitted at the
BOI. When the evidence has so substantially changed the nature of the Statement of Reasons that
a new or different reason for separation is present, the LA may need to follow the procedure set
out in AFI 36-3206, paragraph 7.25.4. In cases based on serious misconduct, the LA must give
the definition of serious misconduct, AFI 36-3206, Attachment 1, to the MBRs. When
appropriate in cases involving serious misconduct, the LA may also give instructions on the
elements of the alleged misconduct. Use the discussion of the element of certain offenses
contained within the manual for court-martial as a guide.)

15. Argument and Instructions.

LA: Please be seated. The board will come to order. All parties and members are present. The
recorder may make a closing statement.

REC: _______________.

LA: The respondent’s counsel may make a closing statement.

RC: ________________.
 88                                                                        AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004



LA: The recorder may make a brief rebuttal.

REC: _______________.

LA: (Gives closing instructions, tailored as appropriate to the issues.)

16. BOI Closing Instructions.

LA: Members of the board, in a few moments you will close to determine your findings,
determination, and recommendations in this case. In discharging your duties, you should apply
the following guidelines.

LA: You must make a [separate] finding with respect to [each of] the allegations contained in the
Statement of Reasons. [The] [Each] findings should be consistent with the facts presented.

LA: You must carefully phrase your findings to include the substance of all material facts you
find to be established by the evidence. The primary function of any administrative board is to
discover and report the facts found in the matter under consideration and to present appropriate
recommendations so that higher authorities have adequate information with which to make a
final decision on the case. You must base your findings solely on evidence of record.

LA: By "evidence of record," I mean documents or other exhibits admitted into evidence [and
testimony of witness] [and the respondent’s statement].

LA: In discharging this responsibility, you must use your best judgment and common sense in
resolving disputed and conflicting evidence, considering the probability or improbability of the
evidence and select ing and weighing the evidence considered most worthy of belief. You may
make reasonable inference based on evidence, but you must avoid conjecture. You must make
certain that a preponderance of evidence supports your findings.

*DELETED.

*[LA: Use the following when the respondent is subject to recoupment of education
assistance, special pay or bonus money.)

[LA: I remind you to refer to AFI 36-3206, paragraph 4.32., Recoupment of Education
Assistance, Special Pay or Bonuses, for required findings and recommendations. Remember, if
the respondent is subject to recoupment of education assistance funds and disputes the debt, you
must make findings and recommendations regarding the validity of this debt.]

LA: After you make your findings, you must then determine whether the Air Force should retain
the respondent. LA: If you determine that the Air Force should retain the respondent, you don’t
need to make a further recommendation.
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                              89


LA: If you determine that the Air Force shouldn’t retain the respondent, then you must also
recommend the character of discharge which should be awarded. In this case, the board can
recommend:

[Only an honorable discharge.]

[An honorable discharge, a discharge under honorable conditions (general), or a discharge under
other than honorable conditions.]

17. Character of Discharge.

(NOTE: Don’t read these definitions if the discharge characterization is restricted to an
honorable discharge.)

LA: In my previous instructions to you, I discussed the different types of discharge that this
board may recommend. At this time, I will amplify on the definitions of each type of discharge.

LA: An honorable discharge is appropriate when the military record of the respondent warrants
the highest type of discharge. As a rule, a respondent is entitled to full rights and benefits but is
ineligible to reenter the Service as an enlisted member.

LA: A discharge under honorable conditions (general) is appropriate when the military record of
the respondent isn’t sufficient to warrant an honorable discharge, but is not of such nature that it
warrants a discharge under other than honorable conditions. Usually, the respondent is entitled to
full rights and benefits. If present or future statutes specifically require honorable discharge as a
condition precedent to granting rights and benefits there under, the respondent’s eligibility for
such rights or benefits may be affected. However, the respondent is ineligible to reenter the
Service as an enlisted member.

LA: A discharge under other than honorable conditions (UOTHC) is appropriate when the
military record of the respondent doesn’t warrant other than the least desirable administrative
discharge. Officers who receive a discharge UOTHC normally don’t qualify for certain benefits
as determined by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and are ineligible to reenter the Service as
an enlisted member.

*DELETED.

*DELETED.

18. Voting Procedures.

LA: You must vote by secret written ballot, with at least a majority of the voting members
concurring in the findings, determination, and recommendations. After you complete your
discussion, you will vote first on the findings, and then continue with the determination and the
recommendations, respectively. The president collects and counts the votes and announces the
ballot results to the other board members.
 90                                                                   AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


LA: Retain your copies of AFI 36-3206 to use during deliberations in closed session. If you need
to consult with the legal advisor during your deliberations, the president must open the board and
obtain the advice on the record, in open session in the presence of the recorder, the respondent,
and the respondent’s counsel. If you desire assistance solely to put your findings and
recommendations into proper form, you may call me into your closed session. I will ensure that
the reporter is present to record the proceedings verbatim.

LA: To assist you in putting your findings, determination, and recommendations in proper form,
I have asked the recorder to prepare a worksheet, marked as Board Exhibit [__], which has been
examined by the respondent’s counsel during the preboard session and the out-of-board hearing.

LA: The recorder will hand the worksheet to the president.

REC: (Complies).

LA: Complete the worksheet after you have finished voting. It will be attached to the record, so
please exercise care in completing it. The president will read from the worksheet in announcing
the board’s findings, determination, and recommendations. All the concurring members must
sign the worksheet. The signatures of all members certify that a majority of the voting members
concurred in the findings and recommendations. Members who don’t concur may file an
explanatory statement for inclusion in the record.

(Discuss the worksheet’s format and options.)

LA: Be advised that you may not interpret my comments, questions, or instructions as indicating
an opinion as to the findings, determination, or recommendations you make in this case. You
have the independent responsibility for making these decisions. Does any member of the board
have any questions concerning these instructions or the worksheet?

LA: Does the recorder or the respondent’s counsel desire any additional instructions or have any
objections to the instructions as given?

LA: If questions of law or procedure arise during your closed deliberations, don’t speculate.
Open the board and ask me for guidelines. Likewise, if you wish to call or recall any witness, or
if you desire a recess, you should open the board and make your request. If you need a break (or
would like to recess for a meal or overnight), you should notify me, and we will open the board
to consider your request.

LA: You may not begin to discuss the case until the board closes and all members are present in
the deliberation room. Once your deliberations begin, you may not interrupt them except by
formally opening the board in the presence of all parties, or requesting my assistance solely to
put your findings and recommendations in proper form. (NOTE: The LA may call a recess
before closing the session for the convenience of the members.)

LA: The Board is closed for deliberations.
AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004                                                                           91


19. Announcement of Findings.

LA: Please be seated. The board is open.

REC: All parties who were present when the board closed are again present.

LA: Mr. President, has the board arrived at findings, determination, and recommendations?

PRES: It has.

LA: (If the LA didn’t examine the worksheet in closed session.) Would you fold the worksheet
in half and hand it to the recorder so I can examine it for form. (After compliance and review.) I
find that Board Exhibit ___ is in proper form, and I will return it to the president.

LA: The respondent and counsel please rise. Mr. President, please read from the worksheet,
beginning with the respondent’s grade and name, to announce the board’s findings,
determination, and recommendations.

PRES: (PRES reads findings, determination, and recommendations.)

20. Advice to Respondent.

LA: (If recommendation is for retention.) (RESP’s grade & last name)__________________, I
will give you a memorandum with the board's decision to retain you and we’ll send a copy of the
board’s decision to the SCA and HQ AFPC. You will be receiving a summarized transcript of
the record of the board proceedings with the board's findings and recommendation transcribed
verbatim. However, the reporter's tapes of the record of the board proceedings will be retained
for one year, so they can be tran-scribed verbatim if required.

LA: (If recommendation is for removal from active duty or discharge.) (RESP's grade & last
name)________________, you will be receiving a copy of the record transcribed verbatim. I will
send your case through (SCA), the Air Force Personnel Center and through the General Law
Division, Office of the Judge Advocate General, to the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force
for further referral to a Board of Review for final review. You may not appear in person or be
represented by counsel during this review unless the Board of Review requests you or your
counsel appear.

LA: Within 10 calendar days after you receive or have access to an authenticated copy of the
report of this board's proceedings, you or your counsel may file with this board any suggested
corrections to the report that you think necessary to make sure the transcript conforms to the
testimony given during the hearings. I will determine what corrections are allowable and will
advise you accordingly.

LA: Within the 10-day period, you may also submit to the convening authority any brief or
argument that you feel should be considered in the final evaluation of your case.
 92                                                                   AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


LA: This board may be reconvened any time before the Secretary of the Air Force makes a final
decision in your case if additional evidence that could materially affect its findings and
recommendations is discovered or brought to the attention of the convening authority, and if it
can be established that such evidence was not reasonably available for presentation to the board
during its proceedings. If you discover additional evidence that was not reasonably available for
presentation to the board during the hearing, you may also submit it within the 10-day period
after you receive a copy of the report of this board's proceedings.

                                          19 JUNE 1998

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This change incorporates interim change (IC) 98-1 which changes the type of characterization an
officer may receive and adds a new reason when discharged for substandard performance of
duty; authorizes separation of officers who are not sentenced to a dismissal and are sentenced to
serve in confinement for six months or more; requires notification of show cause action to be
sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt; nonresponse to the show cause notification
will be construed as the respondent voluntarily electing not to appear before the board; and
changes the processing time guidelines for officers eligible for transition assistance program
benefits who elect to take excess leave or permissive TDY for relocation/transition activities.
Updates office symbols throughout the publication. See the last attachment of the publication, IC
98-1, for the complete IC. A bar ( | ) indicates revision from the previous edition.

2.1. Character of Discharge. An officer discharged solely for substandard performance of duty
may receive an honorable or under honorable conditions (general) discharge.

2.3.11. Failure to maintain satisfactory progress while in an active status student officer program.

3.6.14. An officer who is sentenced by a court-martial to a period of confinement for more than
six months and not sentenced to a dismissal may be separated at any time after the sentence to
confinement has become final and the person has served in confinement for a period of six
months. Officers sentenced to a dismissal cannot be separated until the appellate review of his or
her case is final as announced by AFLSA/JAJR.

7.3.1. Written Notification. The MAJCOM must send the officer written notification at least 30
days before the BOI hearing. The notification will explain why SCA is requiring the officer to
show cause for retention on active duty and the least favorable characterization of discharge
authorized. Notification will be by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt (or by an
equivalent form of notice if such service by U.S. Mail is not available for delivery at an address
outside the United States) to the member’s last known address or to the next of kin.

7.3.3. Personal Appearance or Representation Before a BOI. The respondent may appear in
person at all open proceedings of the BOI. Nonresponse to the notification letter may be
construed as the respondent voluntarily electing not to appear before the Board. Either military
counsel appointed according to AFI 51-201, Military Justice Guide, or military counsel of the
respondent’s own choice, if requested and approved according to AFI 51-201, may represent the
respondent, but not both. The respondent may be represented by civilian counsel, retained at his
or her own expense, in addition to or instead of military counsel.
 96                                                                    AFI36-3206 9 JUNE 2004


4.36. Processing Time Guidelines. Each level of command and headquarters processes cases as
efficiently as possible while protecting the officer’s rights throughout the administrative
discharge process. Case processing begins on the date that the officer receives the initiating
commander’s notification memorandum. MPFs and MAJCOM use express mail or overnight
delivery to reduce mail time. NOTE: The availability of counsel, BOI report transcribing
capability, the need for referral to the Air Force Physical Disability System, or other local
circumstances may affect case processing. Additionally, officers eligible for transition assistance
program benefits may elect to take excess leave or permissive TDY for relocation/transition
activities. (Commanders are not required to authorize either if doing so would interfere with the
military mission.) See AFI 36-3022, Transition Assistance Program, for transition assistance
benefit eligibility requirements and AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, for excess leave and
permissive TDY eligibility requirements.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2000-2 which makes changes and adds guidance
regarding processing resignations in lieu of further administrative discharge. Paragraph 4.25.2 is
amended to indicate that a resignation should be processed through the MAJCOM (vice HQ
AFPC/DPPRS), making it consistent with 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers,
paragraph 2.21; also adds the MAJCOM/CV to the process (if delegated by the MAJCOM/CC).
Paragraph 4.25.3 is amended to add language concerning disapproval authority by the
MAJCOM, and procedures to follow if the SCA is at the MAJCOM level, making it consistent to
AFI 36-3207, paragraph 2.31.

                                           Chapter 4

                  COMMANDERS AND SHOW-CAUSE AUTHORITIES

Section 4C— Show-Cause Authority

4.25.2. The SCA sends the indorsed resignation to the MAJCOM/CC (or MAJCOM/CV, if
delegated). The indorsement should include the SCA notification memorandum, all supporting
documents, and the officer’s response (if any). The SCA recommends the character of discharge
when the basis for the action initiated doesn’t restrict the character of discharge to honorable.

4.25.3. If the MAJCOM/CC recommends approval of the resignation he of she indorses the
resignation and forwards it to HQ AFPC/DPPRS. The MAJCOM/CC may disapprove the
resignation. EXCEPTION: If the SCA for the case is at the MAJCOM level, then the
MAJCOM/CC may not disapprove the resignation and forwards a recommendation for
disapproval to HQ AFPC/DPPRS.
