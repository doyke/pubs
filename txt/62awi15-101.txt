                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. The 62d Operations Support Squadron Weather (OSS/OSW) Flight provides
and/or arranges for weather support to the 62d Airlift Wing (AW), 446 AW, and associate units
assigned to JBLM-McChord Field WA. The 62 OSS/OSW is the focal point for all weather-
related issues. This instruction establishes requirements and procedures pertaining to weather
support during peacetime operations. This instruction will be reviewed annually and updated as
required.
1.2. Background.
     1.2.1. The 62 OSS/OSW performs four main functions: staff, airfield, mission, and
     deployment; to enhance and enable the safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of JBLM-
     McChord Field operations.
     1.2.2. The 25th Operational Weather Squadron (OWS), located at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ,
     provides regional and operational-level weather products and information to Air Force and
     Army units in the western region of the Continental United States (CONUS), to include
     JBLM-McChord Field.
     1.2.3. The 1st Weather Squadron (WS), whose staff is located on JBLM-Main, supports the
     Joint Base Lewis McChord (JBLM) Garrison Commander (CC), and Army units located on
     JBLM-Main.
     1.2.4. 618th Air and Space Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC))/XOW
     located at Scott AFB, IL, assesses and manages weather impacts and risks to AMC global
     mobility operations by providing/arranging mission weather product (MWP) and weather
     risk assessments.
1.3. Responsibilities.
     1.3.1. 62 OSS/OSW fulfills its responsibilities under four main functions:
        1.3.1.1. The Staff Function provides direct interface to the 62 AW and 446 AW
        Commanders and their staffs. 62 OSS/OSW assists in development of weather support
        plan and processes for 62 AW, 446 AW, and associate units. The 62 OSS/OSW will
        support JBLM-McChord Field in educating agencies on the purpose and applicability of
        weather products as required by regulations, or as directed by the 62 AW/CC.
        1.3.1.2. Airfield Services Function augments (supplement/back-up) the Automated
        Meteorological Observation System (AMOS), AN/FMQ-19, when required or manually
        takes, records, and disseminates surface weather observations if the AN/FMQ-19 is not
        available.
            1.3.1.2.1. The 62 OSS/OSW is responsible for a severe weather action program and
            responsibility to forward JBLM-McChord Field forecast and observed weather
            watches, warnings, and advisories (WWA) to 62 AW/CP and JBLM-Main Command
            Center Watch Office (FOD/SDNCO) (See paragraph 8.4.2)
62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                    9


          1.3.1.2.2. The 62 OSS/OSW has the role as OWS backup, issuing, amending, and
          canceling forecast and observed WWA. 25 OWS backup role includes producing and
          amending airfield weather forecasts. The 62 OSS/OSW has primary responsibility
          for the Pilot-To-Metro Service (PMSV).
       1.3.1.3. Mission Weather Function provides transient aircrew support, backup to 618th
       Air and Space Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC))/XOW to
       include Integrated Flight Management (IFM) and non-IFM weather packages. The 62
       OSS/OSW using the ―provide or arrange for concept‖ (per AFMAN 15-129) will provide
       local support for missions not supported by 618th Air and Space Operations Center
       (Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC))/XOW (RODEO, MOBEX, ORI, air shows, and
       other miscellaneous exercises within operating means).
       1.3.1.4. Deployment Function. The 62OSS/OSW will provide deployment capabilities
       IAW the 62 OSS/OSW DOC Statement.
   1.3.2. 25 OWS.
       1.3.2.1. According to the AFI 15-128, Aerospace Weather Operations- Roles and
       Responsibilities, an OWS will provide resource protection, Terminal Aerodrome
       Forecasts (TAF), regional and operational-level weather products and information,
       meteorological watch (METWATCH) and flight weather briefing support for Air Force
       locations within designated geographic regions.
       1.3.2.2. Specific responsibilities of 25 OWS are defined in the installation data page
       IAW 15-129 between the 62 OSS and 25 OWS. 25 OWS issues McChord’s TAF,
       forecast weather warnings and watches, and observed weather advisories during limited
       duty hours. 25 OWS will also provide flight weather briefings to transient aircrews
       passing through McChord that cannot be supported by the 62 OSS/OSW.
   1.3.3. 618th Air and Space Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center
   (TACC))/XOW has primary responsibility for 62/446 AW Integrated Flight Management
   (IFM). The Air Mobility Command Total Force Mission Weather Services plan, 618th Air
   and Space Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC))/XOW will have
   responsibility for 62 AW and 446 AW training briefs.
1.4. Duty Priorities.
   1.4.1. 25 OWS Duty Priorities. 25 OWS duty priorities listed in Table 1.1 and Table 1.2
   exist to match and balance limited manning and mission critical tasks. Duty priorities focus
   efforts during peak work periods prone to task saturation and priority conflicts. Weather
   operators will exercise good judgment in complying with these duty priorities, especially
   when there is imminent danger to life and/or property.

Notes:
1. OWS Backup Support will move to # 6 priority during an OWS outage.
2. Local dissemination refers to weather observations, forecasts, watches, advisories and
warnings that are sent to base agencies (e.g., Airfield Management (AM) Operations,
Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), the JBLM-Main FOD/SDNCO, etc.). Tower will use
the FMQ-19 and Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) sensors/applications to their fullest.

1.5. Operational Hours. Airfield services will be provided Monday-Thursday (0500-2100
local) and Friday (0500-1700 local). Airfield Service hours may be extended based on 62 AW or
446 AW flying hours. See Chapter 3 for specific airfield services. Limited staff services, listed
in Chapter 5, are usually available during normal duty hours or as required (e.g., exercises, etc).
1.6. Assumptions, Shortfalls, and Limitations.
   1.6.1. 25 OWS Assumptions. Adequate resources and communications will be available to
   execute the Installation Data Page and sufficient weather intelligence will be available from
   various sources on which to base weather operations and production.
   1.6.2. 62 OSS/OSW Assumptions. Weather support can only be provided if appropriate
   facilities, funding, communications, personnel, and indigenous support (e.g., power, water,
   etc.) are available.
   1.6.3. 62 OSS/OSW Shortfalls. Some services may not always be available (e.g., out-of-
   station briefings) due to 62 OSS/OSW staffing, station evacuation, or other higher priority
   missions.
   1.6.4. 62 OSS/OSW Limitations.
       1.6.4.1. AN/FMQ-19 limitations. The FMQ-19 is an AMOS that has created a new
       philosophy for weather observing. Its observations are representative of the approach
       end of the runway only as opposed to the entire airfield. Only clouds directly above
       sensor are included in the observation.
       1.6.4.2. Limitations during augmentation (supplement/backup) of the AN/FMQ-19 when
       required. The physical limitations listed in Table 1.4 may impact the representation of
       JBLM-McChord Field weather observations taken from a point north of building 1172.
 12                                                              62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012


Table 1.4. Observing Limitations from Bldg 1172.
#     Limitation
1     Building 1172 has no windows. Thus rapid changes in the weather (i.e., the start and stop
      of precipitation) may go unnoticed for a short time.
2     Buildings, hangars, parked aircraft and trees block portions of the sky as well as ground
      visibility reference markers, especially clockwise from south through north.
3     There are few adequate ground visibility reference markers beyond 1 mile. This especially
      degrades determination of nighttime visibility.
4     Nearby lighting contaminates and complicates nighttime sky condition observing.
5     The south end of the runway is not visible from the observation point. When fog and (or)
      low clouds are present over the approach end of Runway 34 (south of the field), conditions
      reported from the observation point may not be representative.
Note: The Cooperative Weather Watch, paragraph 3.6, exists to alleviate these deficiencies.

        1.6.4.3. Lightning. Lightning may not be seen due to distance, low clouds, or poor
        visibility. Thunder may not be heard because of flight-line noise.
1.7. Alternate (Backup) Operating Location (AOL).
    1.7.1. Airfield Weather services will move to Building 313 in the event of a building
    evacuation. For real-world mission reasons, the 62 OSS/OSW will not evacuate for
    exercises. The flight will continue operational AW support and the 62 OSS/OSW ―eyes
    forward‖ responsibilities for 25 OWS. Access to observing sensing equipment readouts may
    be lost and backup equipment use will be implemented, if needed. 62 OSS/OSW members
    will follow duty-specific Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and Evacuation Checklists
    (including a list of required backup equipment) and resume services at the alternate location
    as soon as possible. Most 62 OSS/OSW services and support will be provided, but will
    require a case-by-case assessment dependent on communication line status, equipment status,
    etc. Expect most services to be somewhat degraded (weather products, pilot briefings, etc)
    due to limited facilities and loss of dedicated data services, including sensors and various
    data types (Metsat, radar imagery, etc).

Table 1.5. Observing Limitations from Bldg 313.
#     Limitation
1     Building 313 has no windows facing the runway. Thus rapid changes in the weather (i.e.,
      the start and stop of precipitation) may go unnoticed for a short time.
2     Buildings, hangars, parked aircraft and trees block portions of the sky as well as ground
      visibility reference markers, especially clockwise from south through west through north
3     There are few adequate ground visibility reference markers beyond 1 mile. This especially
      degrades determination of nighttime visibility.
4     Nearby lighting contaminates and complicates nighttime sky condition observing
62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                     13



5    The north end of the runway is not visible from the observation point. When fog and (or)
     low clouds are present over the approach end of Runway 16 (north of the field), conditions
     reported from the observation point may not be representative.

    1.7.2. Staff services will also move to Building 313. All contact information for the 62
    OSS/OSW remains the same if the AOL is Bldg 313, unless affected by base communication
    outages.
    1.7.3. If Building 313 is unusable, the Control Tower will be used as alternate weather
    operations site. In the event that both Building 313 and the Control Tower are unusable, the
    alternate weather operations site may be established at any other suitable location. Minimum
    desired requirements for the alternate site are: availability of power, a Class A telephone,
    easy access to the outside, and a view of the runway. See Paragraphs 9.2 and 9.3 for details
    on dissemination backup procedures. See the appropriate 62 OSS/OSW SOPs for more
    details.
1.8. Release of Weather Information to Non-DoD Agencies and Individuals. Weather
information will not be released to non-DoD agencies or the general public without approval
from the 62 AW Public Affairs and Legal offices. Contractors employed by DoD on JBLM-
McChord Field will be supported. Any questions and clarifications will be coordinated through
the 62 OSS/OSW leadership.
1.9. Post-Mission Analysis / Feedback. Per AFMAN 15-129, Aerospace Weather Operations-
Processes and Procedures, Chapter 4, units that regularly utilize weather support from 62
OSS/OSW should provide post-mission and utilization feedback, when possible. This
information will be used to ensure products delivered to flying customers are accurate, relevant,
and timely. This feedback will form a database to better manage weather products. Formal and
informal feedback methods include:
        Completing feedback form included with MWP briefing or online at our homepage
        (https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/62oss/OSW1/default.aspx) and dropping that off at the
        forecast counter
        Faxing feedback form to the 62 OSS/OSW (DSN 382-1088)
        E-mail and/or phone calls to the 62 OSS/OSW NCOIC
        Face to face feedback after any briefing


The 62 OSS/OSW will use this data to refine its mission support role and gauge unit strengths
and weaknesses. Representative sample sizes are necessary to accurately reflect the satisfaction
with and accuracy of the mission weather support being provided to 62 AW and 446 AW flying
units by the 62 OSS/OSW. Feedback forms are preferred. Any MWS or IFM feedback received
by 62 OSS/OSW will be forwarded to 618th Air and Space Operations Center (Tanker Airlift
Control Center (TACC))/XOW.
1.10. Mishap Procedures. 62 OSS/OSW members and 25 OWS have a role when the airfield
is advised of an emergency or mishap. During non-duty hours a 62 OSS/OSW forecaster will be
recalled to provide mishap support. The 62 OSS/OSW will ensure applicable data used in the
 14                                                           62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012


development of any weather product, and/or service provided is saved for an investigation (to
include MWPs, space weather products, etc). The 62 OSS/OSW will take an observation
immediately following notification of a mishap if the FMQ-19 one minute observations are not
working. The 62 OSS/OSW and 25 OWS will save enough data before and after the mishap to
fully reconstruct the environmental conditions. The 62 OSS/OSW will coordinate with 25 OWS
at DSN 228-7338 to save all applicable data and products IAW the 62 OSS/OSW and 25 OWS
MOA. The 62 OSS/OSW will coordinate with Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) Operations
at DSN 271-3244 and 618th Air and Space Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center
(TACC)) at DSN 779-4795 to save any applicable data and products not available locally. The
62 OSS/OSW at the departure installation and the mishap location (if on a military installation)
will follow the Aircraft Mishap procedures in Chapter 1 of AFMAN 15-129, Aerospace Weather
Operations- Processes and Procedures.

                                  AIRFIELD SERVICES

3.1. General. Airfield Services include those actions that affect the McChord aerodrome
(defined within 5 miles of the airfield). Examples include augmenting weather observations,
severe weather actions, OWS backup, PMSV, and resource protection. Severe weather actions
and resource protection are addressed in depth in Chapter 8.
3.2. Operational Hours. Airfield Services are normally provided Monday-Thursday (0500-
2100L) and Friday (0500-1700L). Airfield Service hours may be extended based on 62 AW or
446 AW flying hours. Weather personnel performing these services can be contacted at DSN
382-3434/5005/2112. A standby person is available during periods of time when the weather
station in closed and can be contacted by cell phone, (253) 209-4919.
3.3. Observations. Observations are taken, recorded, and disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-111,
Surface Weather Observations. Observations typically contain the following elements:
observation type; date and time; winds; visibility; present weather; cloud groups; temperature
and dew-point; altimeter setting; and additional remarks. There are two types of observations
(described below) that are seen by customers at JBLM-McChord Field. Attachment 6 contains
examples of the different types of observations.
   3.3.1. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR). METAR observations are taken and
   disseminated every hour between 55 and 59 minutes after the hour. The observation is taken
   from the Official Observing Site. A METAR observation could also indicate that special
   criteria were met during the observing period (see Attachment 3 for special observing
   criteria).
   3.3.2. Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI). SPECI observations are taken
   whenever certain weather events, defined in AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations
   and within this document (listed in Attachment 3) occur at JBLM-McChord Field.
   3.3.3. Official Observing Site. At JBLM-McChord Field the AMOS, AN/FMQ-19, is the
   official source for all weather information included in the observation. The main sensor
   group is located on Runway 16 (north end of the runway) and the discontinuity sensor group
   is located on Runway 34 (south end of the runway). There is an additional sensor group at
   the mid-field. See Figure 3.1.
62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                   19


Figure 3.1. Airfield Diagram.




   3.3.4. Augmentation Observing Site. This is the physical location where the forecaster
   visually determines sky condition, present weather, and prevailing visibility to augment the
   FMQ-19. McChord’s augmentation observation site is located 141 feet away from the north
   side of Building 1172.
3.4. Augmentation. Augmentation is a process whereby the weather technicians manually add
or edit data to an observation generated by the AN/FMQ-19 during operational hours or in the
event that the technicians are recalled per paragraph 8.11, 12.3.7, and 12.5.13. The two
augmentation processes used are supplementing and back-up IAW AFMAN 15-111, Surface
Weather Observations, Chapter 3.
   3.4.1. Supplementing is a method of manually adding meteorological information to an
   automated observation that is beyond the capabilities of the AN/FMQ-19 to detect and/or
   report. Weather technicians will supplement observations when the airfield is open and the
   weather conditions below are observed. Weather technicians will perform a BWW from the
   observing location and be ready to supplement observations if the conditions below are
   forecast to occur within 2 hours. Weather personnel are required to log on to an AMOS and
   be prepared to supplement whenever a watch or warning has been issued for tornadic
   activity. Weather technicians will be recalled by the 25 OWS to supplement observations
   during non-duty hours and these conditions are forecast. Mandatory Supplementary Weather
   Conditions at JBLM-McChord Field are:
       3.4.1.1. Tornado
       3.4.1.2. Funnel Cloud
       3.4.1.3. Water Spout
       3.4.1.4. Hail
       3.4.1.5. Volcanic Ash. Note: 25 OWS will recall weather technician if volcanic ash is
       reported by stations in the vicinity, if a SIGMET or AIRMET is issued by the NWS or
       civil Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAAC).
   3.4.2. Mandatory Supplementary Weather Condition Remarks at JBLM-McChord Field are:
       3.4.2.1. Tornadic Activity
 20                                                             62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012


       3.4.2.2. Snow Depth during airfield operating hours if heavy snow warning has been
       issued and snowfall is occurring
   3.4.3. Back-up is the method of manually providing meteorological data and/or
   dissemination to an AN/FMQ-19 observation when the primary automated method is not
   operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure. (See Table 10.1)
3.5. Continuous Weather Watch (CWW). A CWW is the process by which the weather is
continuously monitored. The FMQ-19 performs an automatic CWW at JBLM-McChord Field.
   3.5.1. Weather technicians perform Basic Weather Watch (BWW) when augmentation is
   required. During a BWW, weather technicians will recheck weather conditions, at intervals
   not to exceed 20 minutes since the last observation/recheck, when any of the following
   conditions are observed to be occurring or are forecast to occur within 1 hour:
       3.5.1.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
       3.5.1.2. Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet.
       3.5.1.3. Visibility decreases to less than 3 miles (4800 meters).
       3.5.1.4. Visibility increases to equal or exceed 3 miles (4800 meters).
       3.5.1.5. Precipitation (any form).
       3.5.1.6. Thunderstorms
       3.5.1.7. Fog or Mist
       3.5.1.8. Any other changes in conditions that will require a SPECI observation.
   3.5.2. Weather technicians will also monitor local area observation and forecast products as
   often as necessary to keep abreast of changes expected to affect their area of responsibility.
3.6. Cooperative Weather Watch. Cooperative Weather Watch is the process of Air Traffic
Control (ATC) personnel, flying units, and DES (Security Forces) personnel reporting changes in
weather conditions to the duty weather technician (DSN 382-3434/2112). Cooperative Weather
Watch inherently dictates close contact between 62 OSS/OSW and these units/functions. 62
OSS/OSW leadership is responsible for ensuring Cooperative Weather Watch compliance by
coordinating with associated Cooperative Weather Watch unit leadership. Primary concerns
include: reports of tower visibility different from prevailing visibility, local PIREPs, and any
occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions that could affect flight safety or be
critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations and resources. OSA personnel will
notify 62 OSS/OSW for all criteria in paragraphs 12.4 and 12.5. Note: See section 5.7. for
training of JBLM-McChord Field Control Tower personnel as part of Cooperative Weather
Watch program.
3.7. Eyes Forward.
   3.7.1. 62 OSS/OSW technicians will relay significant, time-sensitive meteorological
   information to the technicians conducting forecasting and METWATCH operations at 25
   OWS. Eyes Forward provides an organized approach for weather personnel to maintain
   situational awareness of the current and future meteorological situation within a designated
   area(s).
62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                       21


   3.7.2. All on-site meteorological and commercial data sources (METSAT, weather radar,
   websites, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather radio, etc.)
   may be used to accomplish this task.
   3.7.3. The 62 OSS/OSW provides meaningful meteorological information not contained in
   the coded observations to 25 OWS.
   3.7.4. The 62 OSS/OSW integrates the current state of the atmosphere into an understanding
   of future impacts on forecast conditions and communicates the impacts, and information, to
   25 OWS, as needed.
   3.7.5. Products of particular note provided by the OWS include but are not limited to:
       3.7.5.1. Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories.
       3.7.5.2. Mission Services.
       3.7.5.3. TAF.
       3.7.5.4. Thunderstorm, Turbulence, and Icing Hazard Charts.
   3.7.6. The 62 OSS/OSW will also contact 25 OWS in regards to:
       3.7.6.1. Severe weather occurrences or damage.
       3.7.6.2. Emergencies such as weather station evacuation or aircraft mishap.
       3.7.6.3. Equipment or airfield outages.
       3.7.6.4. Administrative changes such as station operating hours or closure.
3.8. PMSV Support. Weather information is available via PMSV during 62 OSS/OSW duty
hours (Monday-Thursday (1200-0400Z) and Friday (1200-0000Z) excluding holidays or during
severe weather on frequency 342.3 MHz. Wx Flt DSN 382-3434/5005, C253-982-3434/5005.
3.9. Weather Sensors. The AN/FMQ-19 Operator Interface Device must be manually changed
to update with the current active runway when it is changed by JBLM-McChord Field Control
Tower personnel
3.10. TAFs. JBLM-McChord Field TAFs will be produced and disseminated by 25 OWS, IAW
AFI 15-128, AFMAN 15-124, AFMAN 15-129, and the JBLM-McChord Field/25 OWS Data

                                    MISSION SERVICES

4.1. General. Mission services are those actions directly related to completing each customer’s
daily mission(s) (e.g., TAF, Flight Weather Briefings). The Mission weather product (MWP) is
the primary tool used to accomplish these tasks. MWPs are tailored to individual customer
requirements and may include; a DD Form 175-1 Flight Weather Briefing, a GDSS II generated
brief, JBLM-McChord Field North West MWP Flight Briefing, or a verbal weather forecast.
4.2. Operational Hours. Mission services are provided Monday-Thursday (0500-2100L) and
Friday (0500-1700L). Mission Service hours may be extended based on 62 AW or 446 AW
flying hours.
4.3. Mission Weather Product (MWP). MWPs are essentially mission-specific forecasts that
are developed using an 8-step process, and may be provided by a number of methods (web-
based, verbally, person-to-person, MWPs, etc). During this process, 618th Air and Space
Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC))/XOW and the 62 OSS/OSW will fuse
and tailor products created by strategic and theater weather centers, as well as information
supplied by local units (e.g., flying schedule) and agencies. The result is a product and
information designed to provide timely, accurate, and relevant weather intelligence to various
customers by whatever means proves most effective (e.g., 5 day forecast, staff briefings, etc.).
MWPs must be horizontally consistent with (but not necessarily mirror) products issued by
TACC, 25 OWS, and AFWA. However, during rapidly changing conditions, emergencies, or
when conditions threaten resource protection, the 62 OSS/OSW will amend the MWP to
accurately reflect conditions and back brief TACC and 25 OWS when time permits. Note:
Aircrews who receive a faxed Weather Briefing form must contact the duty weather technician
prior to take-off for the weather briefing to be considered official.
   4.3.1. GDSS2 Briefings: Weather flight briefings for all local AMC missions, to include
   both the 62 AW and the 446 AW, IAW 18 AF CC Mission Weather Services Enabling
   Concept and Implementation Plan, 16 Oct 08, will be GDSS2 weather briefs.
       4.3.1.1. First, the 618th Air and Space Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center
       (TACC))/XOW will edit the ORM column in GDSS 2 at least 30-hours prior to
       scheduled departure time for all local/training missions. They will assign a red ORM
       category when the thresholds in Table 4.2 are met.
           4.3.1.1.1. Next, 618th Air and Space Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control
           Center (TACC))/XOW will edit the weather packages in GDSS2 and brief the
           aircrews when they are called. The weather package will be based on the mission
           profile input by the aircrew. The package will include Takeoff Weather, Destination
           Weather, Air Refueling track forecast weather, Military Operating Area forecast
           weather, Low Level Route forecast weather, Drop Zone weather (as appropriate)
           climb winds, and attachment of hazard and flight level wind charts. See Figure 4.1.
           Till the package is published, the package will have the disclaimer ―DRAFT–Papers
           in Work–Not Finalized. Contact Flight Manager‖. See Figure 4.2. The One Stop
           personnel will initiate the process to publish the papers in GDSS2 before printing
           them for the aircrews.

4.4. MISSIONWATCH is used to describe the process by which the 62 OSS/OSW monitors
the weather for all missions briefed by the 62 OSS/OSW. 618th Air and Space Operations Center
(Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC))/XOW provides MISSIONWATCH for all missions they
brief. All on-site meteorological and commercial data sources may be used to accomplish this
task and is the primary responsibility of the duty forecaster. It is through this method that MWP
amendments or updates are accomplished. During rapidly changing weather, the 62 OSS/OSW
will amend/update MWPs briefed by the 62 OSS/OSW anytime TAF amendment criteria are
met, or at any time deemed necessary to ensure flight safety. For example, MWPs will be
amended whenever a warning or advisory is issued. The 62 OSS/OSW will contact ATC
personnel and/or the command post to pass on critical changes to applicable aircrews.
    4.4.1. 62 OSS/OSW will subscribe to, and monitor Weather Threat Assessment (WTA)
    notifications for wing missions and ensure all planning products are horizontally consistent
    with the WTA. Additionally 62 OSS/OSW will coordinate with 618th Air and Space
    Operations Center (Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC))/XOW if weather deviates from
    the published WTA threats across a threshold in Table 4.2.

These briefings are a specialized type of MWP focused on a particular event/audience.
Examples include, but are not limited to, staff meetings, Crisis Action Team (CAT) briefings,
and Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) briefings.
5.2. Operational Hours. The normal staff weather service duty hours are Monday-Friday from
0730-1630L. Contingency, emergency, and exercise briefings are provided as required. Given
the low manning for 62 OSS/OSW leadership, there will be times when requested staff weather
support cannot be provided.
5.3. Daily 62 AW Standup Briefs. The ―slides only‖ staff weather briefing for 62 AW occur
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday at 0900L. The Standup Brief slide will be posted to the
62 AW L: drive NLT 0700L each morning. The slide is the JBLM-McChord Field automated
five-day outlook. In the case of unusual inclement weather, a briefer will be present.
   5.3.1. If a Hurricane or a Typhoon is forecast to impact any United States Department of
   Defense installation within 72 hours, a slide will be added with storm graphics, as applicable.
   5.3.2. If 62 AW flight mission operations are impacted by volcanic ash from any volcano
   throughout the globe, a slide will be added with the volcanic ash track.
   5.3.3. The Flight Chief or the NCOIC are normally available on short notice to brief the 62
   AW CC in the event of inclement weather impacting operations. A satellite loop will be
   displayed and briefed, along with the 5-day outlook.
5.4. Deleted
5.5. Five-Day Forecast. The Five-Day Forecast, produced by the 25 OWS, provides JBLM-
McChord Field personnel with a five-day outlook of sensible weather expected on the airfield. It is
designed to provide general weather conditions expected for the next five days. The Five-Day
Forecast is issued daily NLT 0630 and 1430L Monday thru Friday. Note: The Five-Day Forecast is
available on the 62 OSS/OSW homepage https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/62oss/OSW1/default.aspx. In
the event of a LAN outage, the Five-Day Forecast can be faxed to the requesting unit.
5.6. Friday Wing Run email. The Friday Wing Run email is prepared and sent on Friday by
1200L, to allow Wing leadership time to decide if weather conditions are conducive to the run at
1500L. The message is emailed to the 62 AW/CC, 62 AW executives, 62 AW/CP, 62 OSS/CC
and 62 OSS/DO. The 62 OSS/OSW will ensure the email is blackberry friendly (Text format
instead of an attachment).
5.7. Air Traffic Control (ATC) Limited Observation Training. ATC Limited Observing
Training is provided by the weather flight for ATC personnel to be certified as part of the
Cooperative Weather Watch program. The ATC individual seeking training will call the weather
flight and schedule an appointment with leadership at DSN 382-5489/5922 for training. After
ATC personnel complete the training they will take a short test on the information and receive a
familiarization tour of the weather station. Weather personnel will sign the controller's AF Form
3622 in pen to certify limited weather observer training.

5.8. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) Briefings. IRC training for 62 and 446 AW crews
are conducted via computer based training (CBT). The 62 OSS/OSW can provide IRC briefings
as required by course scheduling or 62 OG/OGV in accordance with AFMAN 11-210,
Instrument Refresher Program (IRP), using FYI42 and AFI 11-203 as references to help enhance
the CBTs. The IRC briefs will be tailored to focus on local effects. The 62 OSS/OSW will
ensure the 62 OSS DO is aware of training to be given.
5.9. Safety Briefs. 62 OSS/OSW will provide safety briefings as requested at the quarterly
flyers safety brief and flying unit Commander’s Calls using FYI42 and AFI 11-203 as
references. The safety topics will be tailored to focus on local effects such as turbulence or icing
conditions. The 62 OSS/OSW will ensure the 62 OSS DO is aware of training to be given.
5.10. CAT Briefings. The 62 OSS/OSW is a secondary member of the CAT and will provide
weather briefings as required or requested by CAT leadership. This includes real-world
emergency, exercise, and deployment briefings. Notification will be relayed from the 62 AW/CP
via the McChord AtHoc or the Crash Phone. Each briefing will be tailored to provide the
appropriate weather intelligence required by Wing leadership. Standard information includes
satellite and radar imagery, hazards, flight level winds, and a 24-hour McChord forecast.
5.11. Flying Unit Integration. 62 OSS/OSW will visit flying units no less than once every
three months to discuss support and feedback.
5.12. Climatology Briefings. Climatology information will be provided as requested.
5.13. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Weather Updates. The 62 OSS/OSW is
responsible for ensuring all weather information in the FLIP for JBLM-McChord Field is
accurate. All weather related updates will be requested through the AM Ops FLIP Manager, 62
OSS/OSAA. The FLIP Manager will process the information to Air Force Flight Standards
Agency (AFFSA/OL-D). Updates will fall in one of three categories: revisions, changes, or
corrections.
5.14. Pre-deployment Planning Briefings. The 62 OSS/OSW will provide pre-deployment
weather briefings when requested for deploying units. The content of the briefing will vary
depending on the customer’s requirements. For example, an aviation unit will be briefed on
weather impacts enroute and at the deployed location based on their flying mission in addition to
the standard surface weather information usually presented to ground units. This normally
includes ICAO, latitude and longitude location, field elevation, runway orientation, UTC
difference, closest alternates, and climatology. A ground-based unit, such as security forces, will
receive a briefing on surface temperatures, wind speed, potential for blowing sand or dust, and
precipitation, as well as climatology.

                     SPACE WEATHER SUPPORT AND SERVICES

6.1. General. Many of our weapons and communications systems use satellites and radio waves
(High Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF), Ultra High Frequency (UHF), and Satellite
Communications (SATCOM), that can be rendered useless by electro-magnetic radiation from
the sun.
6.2. Limitations. One of the biggest limitations in identifying and forecasting space weather is
a lack of sensors. Additionally, given the speed of solar wind and light, the ability to provide
lead-times for significant space events is extremely limited.
6.3. Space Weather Alerts and Warnings. McChord’s missions have a wide variety of
operations possibly affected by various space weather conditions (HF and UHF communication,
radar, GPS, etc). Broad coverage CONUS-based space weather products (graphics) are
displayed on the NIPRNET at https://weather.afwa.af.mil/conus_space.html. These products
are used to update the Space Weather portion (HF, UHF, and GPS) of the North West MWP.
Space Weather analysis, alerts, forecasts and warnings are listed in attachment 6. Additionally,
Space Weather impacts will be reported through the appropriate link on this site. Bulletins are
also available through the Joint Air Force and Army Weather Information Network (JAAWIN)
at https://weather.afwa.af.mil/space.html. A sample of the daily discussion is provided in
Table 6.1.

Table 6.1. Sample Space Environment Discussion.




6.4. Products. Numerous space weather products are available from JAAWIN (see links
above). Most Space Weather products from the strategic center are ―now-casts‖ and/or very
short-term forecasts (6-hour periods), so the duty forecaster will check the referenced websites
for updated products whenever preparing and updating a Flight MWP (see Attachment 6 for a
more detailed list of potential space weather impacts). For more information concerning these
products please contact the AFWA or the 62 OSS/OSW.

                          SPECIAL MISSION REQUIREMENTS

7.1. General. This chapter contains all of the specific local requirements submitted by various
organizations throughout JBLM-McChord Field, and verified by the 62 OSS/OSW leadership.
The requirements will be reviewed annually by the requesting unit and updated as required. If
the MWP, a watch, warning, or an advisory does not cover a specific local weather requirement,
extra effort will be made (time permitting) to contact the individual unit to advise of the
condition. In turn, the unit is responsible for contacting the 62 OSS/OSW should their
requirements change.
7.2. 62 AW/PA (Public Affairs). 62 OSS/OSW provides tours of the base weather station for
community groups and others, when coordinated by PA.
7.3. 62 AW/CP (Wing Command Post).
   7.3.1. 62 OSS/OSW provides notification of the observed lightning weather warning via the
   Integrated Weather Warning Capability (IWWC) automated phone call during operational
   hours. If timeliness of notification is delayed or flight safety is compromised, the 62
   OSS/OSW will call directly. In addition, 62 OSS/OSW provides notification of all weather
   watches, warnings, and advisories via telephone in the event that the IWWC system is not
   operational. The 25 OWS will issue all watches, warnings and advisories during 62
   OSS/OSW non operational hours.
   7.3.2. 62 OSS/OSW notifies 62 AW/CP when AOL is activated.
   7.3.3. 62 OSS/OSW will coordinate with the 62 AW/CP on the potential for Weather
   Protocol.
   7.3.4. 62 OSS/OSW notifies 62 AW/CP prior to closure for limited duty and upon reopening
   for normal operations.
7.4. Joint Base Lewis McChord Main Command Center Watch Office (FOD/SDNCO). 62

                                            Chapter 8

                          RESOURCE PROTECTION SERVICES

8.1. General. This chapter contains details on weather watches, warnings, and advisories.
Resource protection is accomplished through a joint effort between 25 OWS and the McChord
62 OSS/OSW. The 25 OWS is responsible for issuing all forecast products including weather
watches and warnings via IWWC to the Control Tower, 62 AW/CP, AM Ops, WADS, and
FOD/SDNCO. The 62 OSS/OSW acts as the ―eyes forward‖ for 25 OWS, and is responsible for
issuing all observed warnings and advisories during operational hours. The 62 OSS/OSW can
issue any forecast warning if there is an immediate threat to life and/or property. In these cases,
the 62 OSS/OSW will back brief 25 OWS when time permits and will also be responsible for
dissemination to local supported agencies. Conversely, the 62 OSS/OSW will act as the alternate
dissemination/notification source for the OWS. The goal is to provide the best possible resource
protection to JBLM-McChord Field.
8.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice sent to customers indicating that
conditions are favorable for the development of a particular type of weather phenomena (e.g.
tornadoes, hail, etc.). Watches are issued for a 5 nm radius of the center-point of the JBLM-
McChord runway complex. Table 8.1 contains all of the weather watches and desired lead-times
issued for JBLM-McChord Field.

Table 8.1. Weather Watch Criteria and Lead Times.
 Criteria                                                                 Desired Lead-Time
 Tornado                                                                  240 minutes

 Snow > 2 inches in < 12 hours                                            As potential warrants
 Freezing Precipitation                                                   As potential warrants
 Lightning within 5 NM                                                    30 minutes
8.3. Weather Warnings. Weather warnings are special notices sent out to customers alerting
them that a predefined weather event, which will pose a threat to life or property, is expected to
occur. Warnings are issued for a 5 nm radius of the center-point of the McChord runway
complex. Forecast warnings, with their desired lead-times, are contained in Table 8.2.

Table 8.2. Weather Warning Criteria and Lead Times.
 Criteria                                                                 Desired Lead-Time
 Tornado                                                                  15 minutes
 Hail > ¾ inch                                                            60 minutes

 Blizzard Conditions                                                    60 minutes
8.4. Observed Weather Warnings. (IAW AFOSH Standards 91-66 & 91-100). Lightning
warnings are the only type of observed warning issued on JBLM-McChord Field. They extend 5
nm in all directions from the airfield. Lightning warnings are not issued until lightning is
observed, either visually, as reported by the FMQ-19 observations, or via the National Lightning
Detection Network.
   8.4.1. The lightning warning will remain valid until lightning has not occurred or been
   carried in an observation in the area for at least 15 minutes. A lightning warning will not be
   cancelled, however, if a thunderstorm is within 5 NM (as observed on radar in conjunction
   with lightning detection systems).
   8.4.2. 62 OSS/OSW will provide timely notification (see Chapter 9) to the Control Tower,
   62 AW/CP, AM Ops, WADS, and JBLM FOD/SDNCO issuance and expiration of a
   lightning warning via IWWC/JET. In the event that the 62 OSS/OSW is closed and lightning
   is observed within 5NM (as observed on radar in conjunction with lightning detection
   systems), Thunderstorms (TS) are reported on an FMQ-19 observation, the 25 OWS will
   issue this observed warning via the IWWC system.
8.5. Forecast and Observed Weather Advisories. A forecast weather advisory is a special
notice sent to customers alerting them that a predefined weather phenomenon, which may impact
operations, is forecast to occur on JBLM-McChord Field. An observed weather advisory is a
special notice sent to customers alerting them that a predefined weather phenomenon, which may
impact operations, is occurring on JBLM-McChord Field. Forecast and observed weather
advisories can be found in Table 8.3.

 Surface winds > 40 knots (See NOTE 2 & 6)                                         Observed
 Surface winds > 60 knots (See NOTE 2 & 6)                                         Observed
 Ice FOD ( Temperature <7o C with dew point depression <5o C) (See NOTE 3)         Observed
 Notes:
 1. Crosswinds are calculated based on the maximum observed wind speed and
 worst case observed direction including variability.
 2. Notification is made by telephone on first occurrence, and cancellation is
 required after 30 minutes of non-occurrence.
 3. Notification is made to WADS only in the event that WADS aircraft are
 positioned on JBLM-McChord Field.
62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                      35


 4. Notification is made to the Control Tower, 62 AW/CP, AM Ops and
 FOD/SDNCO.
 5. Notification is made to the Control Tower, 62 AW/CP, and FOD/SDNCO.
 6. Notification is made to the MOC.

   8.5.1. 25 OWS will issue a forecast snow advisory for a trace to less than two inches of snow
   via IWWC to the Control Tower, 62 AW/CP, AM Ops, and FOD/SDNCO.
   8.5.2. 62 OSS/OSW will disseminate all observed advisories to all agencies via
   JET/IWWCS during operational hours. During 62 OSS/OSW closure hours, 25 OWS will
   issue the observed advisories.
8.6. Format. Advisories, watches, and warnings format is described in Attachment 5. Note:
The JET/IWWCS pre-filled forms, or AF IMT 3806, Weather Watch Advisory Log, and/or AF
IMT 3807, Watch/Warning Notification and Verification, will be completed by the 62
OSS/OSW forecaster.
8.7. Upgrades and Downgrades. A warning is upgraded by adding a phenomena or crossing to
a higher threshold. A warning is downgraded by removing a phenomena or crossing to a lower
threshold. Advisories and warnings will be upgraded (i.e. winds increase from 35 knots to 50
knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the desired lead-times specified above.
Only one forecast warning may be in effect at one time (EXCEPT for tornado and
lightning). If a warning is issued for one criteria, and it becomes necessary to warn for another
criteria, a new warning, with a new number, will be issued to include all criteria expected. A
separate valid time may be specified for each criteria, as necessary.
8.8. Amendments. Amendments to weather warnings and watches will only be issued to
change the valid time and will be issued before the original watch or warning expires. New
warnings and watches will be issued for any change in weather criteria.
8.9. Cancellation. Warnings and watches may be canceled when the weather phenomena are no
longer occurring or expected to occur. However, if not canceled, they will expire at the end of
the valid period. Observed advisories will be canceled when the criteria is no longer occurring
and is not expected to occur again in the next hour. See para. 8.4 for cancellation of observed
lightning warnings.
8.10. Toxic Corridor. The 62 OSS/OSW will provide weather data necessary to calculate toxic
corridors to the Fire Protection Flight/Disaster Control Group (DCG), as requested. The 25
OWS may supplement meteorological data to the appropriate McChord organizations, if
requested, and the 62 OSS/OSW is unable to provide the data.
8.11. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). The SWAP is in place to ensure sufficient
personnel are available during potential/actual severe weather events or during meteorological or
operational events critical to mission success. For the purposes of these procedures severe
weather is defined as tornados, surface winds greater than or equal to 50 knots, hail greater than
or equal to ¾-inch diameter, and freezing precipitation. These procedures document a two-tier
system with the 62 OSS/OSW and 25 OWS implementing a coordinated SWAP to maximize
support to JBLM-McChord Field during severe weather threats/events.
   8.11.1. 62 OSS/OSW Responsibilities.      62 OSS/OSW will perform the SWAP
   responsibilities as defined in AFMAN 15-129, Aerospace Weather Operations-Processes
 36                                                         62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012

   Operational Reporting, 25 OWS MOA 15-11, and this publication. More specifically, 62
   OSS/OSW will accomplish the following procedures:
       8.11.1.1. Notification. During normal staff duty hours (0730 to 1630 local), Monday
       through Friday, except federal holidays/authorized down days) the duty forecaster will
       implement SWAP by notifying 62 OSS/OSW leadership whenever one or more
       conditions in Table 8.4 are met.
       8.11.1.2. Standby/Recall Procedures. During nights, weekends, federal holidays and
       authorized down days, the standby forecaster will be recalled by the OWS per paragraph
       8.11.2.3. The standby forecaster will implement SWAP by notifying the 62 OSS/OSW
       leadership by phone whenever one or more conditions in Table 8.4 are met to determine
       if the Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT) is to be activated: Note: Current contact
       numbers can be found on the recall roster. Contact numbers will be reviewed monthly
       and updated when necessary.

thunderstorm risk area (Slight, Moderate or High).
5. In the event of unforeseen circumstances, such as a communications line failure, a
critical equipment outage at either 25 OWS or 62 OSS/OSW, the 62 OSS/OSW will
implement the SWAP at 25 OWS’s request. The 25 OWS, as the agency ultimately
responsible for forecast watch/warning support, will have this prerogative in the interest of
JBLM-McChord Field resource protection and flight safety.
6. Any other event or situation that the duty forecaster deems notification necessary.

       8.11.1.3. Activation.
62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                     37


           8.11.1.3.1. When 25 OWS issues WWAs that meet SWAP criteria, 25 OWS will
           notify the primary SWAP POC, the 62 OSS/OSW Duty Forecaster, DSN 382-5005 or
           the stand-by cell phone number (253) 209-4919 during limited duty hours, to start
           SWAP procedures. If unable to reach the primary, 25 OWS will notify the alternate
           SWAP POC, 62 AW/CP at DSN 382-2635. As soon as 25 OWS finishes contacting
           the primary or alternate POC, it will implement internal SWAP. Although most
           SWAP criteria are issued by 25 OWS, the 62 OSS/OSW could issue SWAP criteria,
           at which time, it will notify 25 OWS and both will start coordinated SWAP. The
           duty/standby forecaster will discuss the meteorological situation, manning
           requirements, and the recall of additional personnel (or place on standby) with 62
           OSS/OSW leadership. If deemed necessary the SWAT member will report to the
           weather station as soon as possible after notification by the duty/standby forecaster.
           Once the SWAT member has arrived they will assist in evaluating the situation,
           determine the need and availability to recall additional personnel, and execute the
           SWAP duties and responsibilities in Table 8.5.

      Any watches, warnings and/or advisories issued to include actual and desired lead-
3.    time.
4.    Operational status of meteorological equipment.
      Notify 25 OWS and AMC/A3W of the OPREP-3 report and information submitted for
5.    inclusion.
      Request 25 OWS to provide required information, if needed, by performing a weather
6.    data save.

        8.11.3.2. 62 OSS/OSW will provide 25 OWS severe weather reports not normally
        available through standard observations. Reports will be passed immediately after
        fulfilling any local distribution requirement. If this is not possible, 62 OSS/OSW will
        pass the reports as soon as possible so 25 OWS can use the reports during post-analysis
        and verification.
8.12. Severe Weather Damage Reporting/OPREPS. IAW AFMAN 15-129, Aerospace
Weather Observations-Processes and Procedures, AFI 10-229, Responding to Severe Weather
Events, and AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, the 62 OSS/OSW will query base Cooperative
Weather Watch agencies (DES (Security Forces), fire dept, etc), local spotters, and online
damage assessment data sources (NWS, local news, local law enforcement, etc.) to collect the
area impacts of severe weather events (on base or in the immediate surrounding areas) as time
permits after a severe weather occurrence. The 62 OSS/OSW will coordinate with the 62
AW/CP for weather related OPREP-3 and provide the 62 AW/CP any pertinent base
information. The 62 AW/CP, in turn, will provide the 62 OSS/OSW with a copy of any weather
related OPREPs. The 62 OSS/OSW will provide damage reports and OPREP-3s to the OWS
and higher headquarters as soon as possible. Note: The 62 AW/CC is the releasing authority for
OPREP-3s. A courtesy copy to higher headquarters is acceptable, but not an ―official‖ OPREP.

8.13. Frost Forecast gives the 62 AW/CP advance notice to make necessary preparations
for frost conditions. Advance notice ensures that the de-icing equipment is in-place and costly
take-off delays can be avoided.
   8.13.1. 62 OSS/OSW analyzes the frost potential for the next morning. They do this by
   determining if the forecast morning temperature is at or less than 4oC (39 oF) and the sky
   condition forecast is going to be scattered or clear, or if the temperature is forecast to be less
   than 00oC (32 oF), regardless of cloud cover.
   8.13.2. If there is frost potential, the 62 OSS/OSW calls the 62 AW/CP by 1845L and
   instructs them to notify MOC to prepare ground de-icing equipment.
8.14. Weather Protocol. The 62 OSS/OSW will coordinate with 62 AW/CP and recommend
Weather Protocol be initiated for significant forecast snowfall or freezing precipitation at least 36
hours in advance of event. The 62 AW/CP will recommend the implementation of Weather
Protocol by contacting the 62 AW/CC and initiating a conference with 446 AW/CC, Group
Commanders, and 62 OSS/OSW based on 62 AW/CC direction. In addition, the 62 AW/CP will
request a Weather Protocol conference when a Weather Watch is issued for significant snow less
than 36 hours in advance. 62 OSS/OSW will also notify 62 OSS/CC and that weather protocol
has been recommended.
62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                    41

                     WEATHER INFORMATION DISSEMINATION

9.1. General. Forecasts, observations, and weather alerts (warnings, watches, and advisories)
are useful only if the customers have access to them. Timely and efficient dissemination of
weather information is crucial to the success of the wing mission and resource protection. The
Air Traffic Control receives this information via the 62 OSS/OSW’s primary dissemination
system (JET/IWWCS), using its primary local dissemination system (IWWCS). The 62 AW/CP,
AM Ops and JBLM FOD/SDNCO will receive notification via the IWWC system, JET, or a
telephone call of issuance of a warning, watch or advisory. This chapter describes the weather
dissemination systems, dissemination procedures, and backup systems and procedures.
9.2. Dissemination Systems and Backups.
   9.2.1. The 62 OSS/OSW currently uses JET as its primary method of disseminating
   observations, forecasts, warnings, watches, and advisories. The JET is an online application
   that receives data locally from the FMQ-19. The data is streamed to two dedicated servers,
   one on JBLM-McChord Field and the other located in the 25th OWS at Davis Monthan AFB.
   It allows anyone with LAN access and a JET account to view critical weather information.
   JET also uses the IWWC system to send out automated messages for warnings, watches, and
   advisory notification. The 62 OSS/OSW will follow documented backup dissemination
   procedures documented in the 62 OSS/OSW SOPs in the event that JET/IWWC is
   inoperative.
   9.2.2. Local Area Network (LAN). The LAN is the primary method used for disseminating
   web-based 62 OSS/OSW products. Additionally, it is used as the backup system for
   disseminating (longline only) and receiving all weather information. In the event of a LAN
   outage, Web-based 62 OSS/OSW products will be faxed to requestors or may be verbally
   updated.
   9.2.3. Hotlines. Hotlines have been installed between the 62 OSS/OSW and other agencies
   for the sole purpose of rapidly exchanging weather data. Normal phone lines will be used in
   the event of a hotline outage. Hotlines are installed between the 62 OSS/OSW and the
   following agencies:
       9.2.3.1. 62 AW Command Post
       9.2.3.2. JBLM-McChord Field Control Tower
       9.2.3.3. JBLM-McChord Airfield Management
9.3. Dissemination and Backup Procedures.
   9.3.1. TAFs will be entered and disseminated through JET as described in Chapter 3. If JET
   is out of service then the 62 OSS/OSW will disseminate the information locally via hotline or
   standard telephone lines to the JBLM-McChord Field command post and JBLM-McChord
   Field control tower.
   9.3.2. Observation Procedure. Observations will be taken and disseminated through the JET
   as described in Chapter 3. When JET is out of service, observations will be disseminated
   long-line through the Joint Air Force and Army Weather Information Network (JAAWIN).
 42                                                         62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012


   If JAAWIN is out of service, a voice relay via telephone to any other weather station or
   supporting hub (25 OWS) will be made. Locally, observations will be relayed by the 62
   OSS/OSW to the following organizations (noted on a local dissemination log), in order of
   priority when the JET is out of service:
       9.3.2.1. JBLM-McChord Field Control Tower (Hotline or 982-2160)
       9.3.2.2. 62 AW Command Post (Hotline or 982-2635)
       9.3.2.3. McChord Airfield Management (Hotline or 982-5611)
   9.3.3. Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories. Weather watches, warnings, and
   advisories will be disseminated via the JET/IWWC (see Paragraph 9.2.1. for a list of the
   organizations). If the JET/IWWC is out of service, the 62 OSS/OSW will call each agency to
   pass information. Further dissemination by McChord Airfield Management and the 62 AW
   Command Post is as follows:
       9.3.3.1. McChord Airfield Management. McChord Airfield Management further relays
       all weather warnings via the secondary crash net. See Figure 9.1
       9.3.3.2. 62 AW/CP. The 62 AW/CP disseminates all weather watches, warnings, and
       advisories by telephone. See Figure 9.1
       9.3.3.3. Tornado Warnings. The 62AW/CP has the primary responsibility for alerting
       the base population in the event of a tornado warning issuance.
       9.3.3.4. Lightning Warnings. All lightning warnings are disseminated to the base
       populace via AM Ops and 62 AW/CP assuring all members on base to be prepared for
       inclement weather.
9.4. Base Warning Notification Pyramid Structure Diagrams. Per AFI 10-229, Figure 9.1.
shows how weather watches/warnings/advisories are sent through the wing and to tenant units.

                                          Chapter 10

                                  WEATHER EQUIPMENT

10.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the 62 OSS/OSW. Additionally, it provides information on
backup systems, maintenance, and restoring priorities.
10.2. Meteorological Equipment. The 62 OSS/OSW uses a wide range of equipment to
determine the current state of the atmosphere. These critical systems are used continuously to
provide customers the most timely, accurate and relevant weather intelligence possible.
   10.2.1. AN/FMQ-19. The AN/FMQ-19 accurately samples, measures, and reports:
   temperature, wind speed and direction, visibility, runway visual range (RVR), cloud base
   height and amount of coverage, pressure, liquid equivalent precipitation accumulation, and
   ice accretion during freezing precipitation. These measurements are processed to create
   properly formatted, fully automated observations that comply with applicable various
   reporting standards and protocols defined in the Federal Meteorological Handbook (FMH-1),
   the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the Federal Aviation Administration
   (FAA), National Weather Service (NWS), and military reporting standards.
   10.2.2. Kestrel 4500. The primary backup instrument for the AN/FMQ-19 is the Kestrel
   4500. This hand-held device provides temperature, dew point, wind speed, and pressure
   readings.
   10.2.3. TACMET Weather Station (TMQ-53). The long term backup instrument for the
   AN/FMQ-19 is the TMQ-53. It provides all of the aforementioned measurements normally
   provided by the AN/FMQ-19. If the AN/FMQ is inoperative for an extended period of time
   (48 hours or more), the 62 OSS/OSW will set up the TMQ-53 to provide continuous weather
   monitoring. At times the TMQ-53 will be deployed and unavailable for backup. At these
   times the Kestrel 4500 will continue to be used as the backup instrument.
   10.2.4. Lightning Detection. The primary system for lightning detection is the AN/FMQ-19.
   The 62 OSS/OSW uses various other equipment and Internet sources such as ―WeatherTap,‖
   and the TMQ-53.
   10.2.5. NEXRAD. The WSR-88D Open PUP (OPUP) is the primary source for radar
   information. The 62 OSS/OSW uses the commercial weather service ―WeatherTap‖ as a
   secondary source of radar information.
10.3. Communications Equipment. Just as vital as meteorological equipment, communications
equipment allows the 62 OSS/OSW to get the right information to the right customer. The following
systems are the backbone of the 62 OSS/OSW communications network.
   10.3.1. JET. As discussed in Chapter 9, this is our primary system for disseminating
   forecasts, observations, warnings, watches, and advisories. Telephones are used as a backup
   for key aircraft controlling agencies.
   10.3.2. PMSV Radio. The Pilot-To-Metro-Service Radio (342.3 MHz) allows the 62
   OSS/OSW to communicate with aircrews, both on the ground and flying, as well as tower
   personnel. If the PMSV is out of service aircrews can contact the 62 OSS/OSW through
  62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                      45


      phone patch at DSN 382-3434, Fairchild AFB weather at frequency 234.8 or 25 OWS via
      phone patch (where possible) to get weather data.
  10.4. Maintenance. All Equipment requires maintenance from time to time. The following
  organizations provide preventive maintenance and repair weather and communications
  equipment:
  Organization                                                 Equipment
  627 CS/SCMW (Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems         AN/FMQ-19/PMSV
  (ATCALS)
  Base Network Control Center/Air Force Weather Agency         JET
  10.5. Restoring Priorities. Priorities for restoring critical systems have been established in the
  event natural disasters, or any other anomaly, simultaneously impact systems base-wide. The
  response time is broken down into the following codes:
      Code A       Within 30 minutes during duty hours; however, a 1-hour response time is
                   permitted during non-duty hours. Deferment of maintenance may occur only with
                   the concurrence of both the Chief of Maintenance and the user.
      Code C       A response time of 30 minutes during duty hours only--single shift maintenance
                   unless otherwise requested.
  10.6. The priorities for weather equipment are listed in Table 10. 1.

Note: Priorities may be adjusted based on incoming weather.

  10.7. Building Power. Bldg 1172 is equipped with a backup generator. The generator should
  start up automatically when power is cut-off. DPW/627 CES performs quarterly tests to ensure
  the generator is working properly.
  10.8. FMQ-19 Recall Requirements: When individual sensors of the FMQ-19 are inoperative
  during non-operational duty hours for the 62 OSS/OSW, recall will be weather dependent. Some
  sensors require back-up regardless of weather. See Table 10.2 Note 1.
 46                                                                     62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012


10.9. The 62 OSS/OSW Forecaster will always be recalled for the following criteria:
    10.9.1. The FMQ-19/JET is not reporting an hourly observation or specification observation
    when the correct criteria are met.
    10.9.2. Wind sensor outages for the active runway. See Table 10.2 Note 2.
    10.9.3. Any time an altimeter setting (ALSTG) is not reported.
    10.9.4. Any time ATC or 25 OWS personnel believe the FMQ-19 sensors are not
    representative.

                         OWS/62 OSS/OSW BACKUP SUPPORT

11.1. General. There are dozens of scenarios that could cause an interruption of service from
either 25 OWS or the 62 OSS/OSW. This chapter briefly describes how weather services will be
provided should any such events occur.
11.2. 25 OWS. Per the Installation data page, when weather operations at 25 OWS are
interrupted (e.g., power outage, natural disaster, etc.), associated TAF, weather watch and
warning responsibility will be transferred to 62 OSS/OSW until the 25 OWS is postured to
resume operations. Other 25 OWS weather information responsibilities (e.g., graphical
products) will be transferred to other agencies as necessary to continue weather information to
JBLM-McChord Field. For further information please reference 25 OWS – 62 OSS/OSW MOA.
11.3. 62 OSS/OSW. For standard station evacuations, support will resume from our alternate
weather operations site (paragraph 1.7) with 25 OWS assuming responsibilities during any
interim period. For longer interruptions, the 62 OSS/OSW will coordinate required support with
other organizations.
   11.3.1. In the rare event the 62 OSS/OSW cannot provide weather data, contact 25 OWS for
   weather briefings and other required information. The 25 OWS NORTH briefing cell can be
   reached at DSN 228-6598.

                                 RECIPROCAL SUPPORT

12.1. General. This chapter contains all of the specific local requirements submitted by various
organizations throughout JBLM-McChord Field, and verified by the 62 OSS/OSW leadership.
The requirements will be reviewed annually by the requesting unit and updated as required. If
the MWP, a watch, warning, or an advisory does not cover a specific local weather requirement,
extra effort will be made (time permitting) to contact the individual unit to advise of the
condition. In turn, the unit is responsible for contacting the 62 OSS/OSW should their
requirements change.
12.2. 62 AW/PA may coordinate tours of the base weather station by community groups and
others with the weather flight superintendent.
12.3. 62 AW/CP will:

AW/SE.
12.7. NEC/627 CS will:
   12.7.1. Provide, coordinate, or arrange for the installation, maintenance, and repair of all
   weather communication and meteorological sensing equipment, except for the
   communication and meteorological equipment that is maintained by contract (i.e., JET
   hardware).
   12.7.2. Ensure that scheduled maintenance does not degrade the MISSIONWATCH
   performed by the 62 OSS/OSW during periods of inclement weather and notify the 62
   OSS/OSW forecaster prior to routine maintenance. Note: When Airfield Systems
   Maintenance ATCALS team performs periodic maintenance of the AN/FMQ-19
   precipitation gauge, they are required to inject water into the tipping bucket. Because the
   sensor is an analog sensor, and even though it is disabled, the sensor memory remembers the
   injected amount of water and reports it when the sensor is re-enabled. The algorithms process
   this data and then report it into the daily and monthly summary messages. The weather
   technician must ask ATCALS how much water was injected, annotate the amount, and later
   backup (edit) appropriately and remove the amount from the daily precipitation readings.
   Even though the issue of analog sensor and reporting may be corrected in the future, if
   sensors are not carefully managed during maintenance, errors can occur. ATCALS must
   ensure 62 OSS/OSW is notified promptly that the precipitation gauge is undergoing
   maintenance.
   12.7.3. Maintain and update all Technical Orders and will advise operators of any significant
   changes, as received.
   12.7.4. Utilize the restoration priorities for weather communications and meteorological
   sensing equipment outlined in this document. Note: The weather shift supervisor, dependent
   on the weather conditions and mission requirements, may alter restoration priority.
   12.7.5. Notify the responsible service agents for outages.
   12.7.6. Coordinate with off-base agencies to repair off-base lines.
   12.7.7. Perform necessary follow-up actions as required until full service is restored.
   12.7.8. Ensure weather data and telephone circuits are assigned repair priorities.
   12.7.9. Ensure that established maintenance response times are met.
   12.7.10. Ensure a 24-hour point of contact for reporting outages and assigning Job Control
   numbers is available.
62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                    51

  SAMPLE WEATHER PRODUCT DISSEMINATION FORMAT/INTERPRETATION

A5.1. Observations. AMOSs use time averaging of sensor data. In an automated observation,
sky condition will be an evaluation of sensor data gathered during the 30-minute period ending at
the actual time of the observation. All other elements evaluated are based on sensor data that is
within 10 minutes or less of the actual time of the observation.

Table A5.1. Observation format example.




Table A5.2. Observation format and Content.
1. Station identifier – also called the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This
code identifies the location of the observation (in this case JBLM-McChord Field).
2. Type of observation. There are three types of observations as described below:
   a. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR). An observation taken each hour, between
   H+55 and H+59.
   b. Special Observation (SPECI). An observation taken as a result of one of the special
   criteria (listed in attachment 4) being met.
   c. Local Observation (LOCAL). An observation taken as a result of one of the local
   weather criteria (listed in attachment 4) being met. LOCALs will only be taken at manual
   weather flights and during back-up of AMOS pressure sensor.
3. Time. This is the time, in Zulu, or GMT, that the last element of the observation was
observed.
4. Wind. This portion of the observation provides the wind direction (first 3 numbers, VRB for
variable, or 000 for calm), sustained wind speed (next 2 or 3 numbers), and wind gusts (any
numbers following the G, if there have been any) measured in knots. One knot equals 1.14 miles
per hour.
5. Visibility. The furthest predominant distance (at least 50% of the aerodrome) that can be seen
from the airfield, reported in statute miles. The most common visibility reported is 7 miles.
6. Present weather. Any weather phenomenon that is occurring on the airfield. This is
mandatory anytime the visibility is less than 7 miles. Table A5.3. lists the present weather
codes.

7. Sky Condition. Describes the amount of clouds present at the airfield. They fall into the following
categories:
   SKC – Sky Clear
   FEW – 1/8 to 2/8 coverage
   SCT – Scattered; 3/8 to 4/8 coverage
   BKN – Broken; 5/8 to 7/8 coverage
   OVC – Overcast; 8/8 coverage

A5.2. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF).
62AWI15-101 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                      69


Table A5.5. TAF format example.




   A5.2.1. The forecast follows the same general format as the observation with the following
   exceptions:

Table A5.6. TAF format and Content.
1. Valid Date/Time. Forecasts are generally valid for a 24-hour period. In this example the
forecast is valid from the 1st at 1200 Zulu (or GMT) until the 2d at 1200 Z.
2. Max Temp/Min Temp. T24 indicates a maximum temperature in Celsius to occur at 20Z.
T10 indicates a minimum temperature of 10 Celsius to occur at 10Z (NOTE: M indicates a
minus sign in front of the number: M05 = -5 C).
3. BECMG – This is a code to indicate that the predominant condition of the sky will change to
(or become) the conditions listed in that line of the forecast. The conditions will change during
the time period that follows the BECMG code (1400 to 1500Z or 1700 to 1800Z in the above
example).
4. TEMPO – This code means that the conditions listed on that line may occur for periods of an
hour or less (an hour and 15 minutes or less for thunderstorms) anytime between the time frame
following the TEMPO code (1900Z to 2200Z in this example).
