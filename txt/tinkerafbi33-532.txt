clearance and mission requirement. It will be granted only after all criteria have been met and may be
revoked immediately if abused. Every individual who has access to the Air Force network (af.mil)
domain, specialized and mission systems is a network user. Initial and annual Information Assurance (IA)
training is mandatory for all domain users, in accordance with AFI 33-204, Information Assurance
Awareness Program. Every Air Force network user must possess a favorable clearance or background
investigation as outlined in paragraph 4.

2. Responsibilities. The responsibility to initiate background investigations, security checks and the
costs associated rests with the applicant’s organization or contracting company.

3. E-Mail. End-users include military, government, contractor, foreign nationals, volunteers and all oth-
ers who are granted a domain and/or e-mail account(s) on a government network. All end-users must
