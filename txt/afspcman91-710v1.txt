This manual implements Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 3100.10, Space Policy; DoDD
3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base; DoDD 3230.3, DoD Support for Commercial Space
Activities; Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 91-1, Nuclear Weapons and Systems Surety; AFPD 91-2,
Safety Programs; AFPD 63-12, Assurance of Occupational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness; Air
Force Instruction (AFI) 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, (AFSPC Sup 1); and
the Memorandum of Agreement between the Department of the Air Force and the Federal Aviation
Administration on Safety for Space Transportation and Range Activities.
This volume incorporates information previously found in Eastern and Western Range 127-1, Chapter 1,
Eastern and Western Range Policies and Procedures. It describes the Range Safety Program; defines
responsibilities and authorities; and delineates policies, processes, and approvals, and approval levels for
all activities from or onto Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) ranges. These activities include the life
cycle of launch vehicles and payloads from design concept, test, checkout, assembly, and launch to orbital
insertion or impact. The volume also defines Range User responsibilities and describes Range Safety and
Range User interfaces for all AFSPC ranges, including the 30th Space Wing, [Western Range (WR)] at
Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB), California and the 45th Space Wing [Eastern Range (ER)] at Patrick
Air Force Base (PAFB), Florida. Range Users may familiarize themselves with AFSPCI91-701, Range
Safety Program Policy and Requirements, to fully understand the overall Range Safety Program, the capa-
bilities of the ranges, and range management activities.
This volume applies to all Range Users conducting or supporting operations on the AFSPC ranges. Range
Users include any individual or organization that conducts or supports any activity on resources (land,
sea, or air) owned or controlled by AFSPC ranges. This includes such organizations as the Department of
Defense (DoD), United States (US) government agencies, civilian launch operators, and foreign govern-
ment agencies and other foreign entities that use AFSPC range facilities and test equipment; conduct pre-
launch and launch operations, including payloads to orbital insertion or impact; and/or require on-orbit or
other related support. Commercial users intending to provide launch services from one of the ranges shall
have a license or license application in process from the Department of Transportation’s Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) or have a DoD sponsorship and be accepted by the DoD to use the ER or WR. For-

       Users’ program. The tailored edition shall be placed on the Range User’s contract or applied
       through the applicable ranges Universal Documentation System or for FAA licensed launch oper-
       ations, enforced through a Commercial Space Operations Support Agreement. Use of a tailored
       edition of this document is recommended and is beneficial to both the Range User and Range
       Safety. See Volume 1, Attachment 1, for further tailoring instructions.
       1.2.2.2. Developing a tailored edition of AFSPCMAN91-710. The tailored edition should look
       like AFSPCMAN91-710 with the following exceptions:
           1.2.2.2.1. The tailored edition shall be constructed in the following manner:
               1.2.2.2.1.1. Insert a document heading/title that reads, "AFSPCMAN91-710 TAILORED
               FOR" Program Name, date of the applicable contract/agreement/CSOSA/etc.", centered at
               the top of each page.
               1.2.2.2.1.2. Date of tailored edition.
               1.2.2.2.1.3. Insert "PROPRIETARY" at the top, centered directly over heading material,
               and at the bottom of each page (if requested by the Range User).
               1.2.2.2.1.4. Remove the following items from AFSPCMAN91-710 heading (front page):
                  1.2.2.2.1.4.1. Remove "docid" information, i.e. AFSPCMAN91-710VX.
                  1.2.2.2.1.4.2. "BY ORDER OF THE COMMANDER

50                                                                AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004


            1.2.2.2.3. Change "AIR FORCE SPACE COMMAND MANUAL 91-710 VOLUME X"
            to "Extracted from AIR FORCE SPACE COMMAND MANUAL 91-710 VOLUME X"
            1.2.2.2.4. Change "COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY" to
            "COMPLIANCE WITH THIS TAILORED EXTRACT OF AFSPCMAN91-710 IS
            MANDATORY"
     1.2.3. New Programs. This publication is applicable to all new programs with program introduction
     (PI) submittals dated after the initial publication of AFSPCMAN 91-710. Range Users are encouraged
     to perform PIs at the earliest possible time. Formal PI to Range Safety for launch vehicles is accom-
     plished through the Space Wing Programs and Plans (SW/XP) office. Informal PIs, such as those for
     payloads that do not go through the formal Universal Documentation System (UDS) process, may be
     provided through the sponsoring Range User. Before the PI, informal meetings to discuss Range
     Safety requirements and their impact on conceptual designs may be arranged directly with the office
     of the Chief of Safety at the applicable range. Programs that have begun significant design before the
     PI should approach Range Safety to discuss applicable requirements. Formal meetings with Range
     Safety shall be made through the SW/XP office.
     1.2.4. Previously Approved Programs. Existing program and noncompliance approvals approved
     before the initial publication date of AFSPCMAN 91-710 shall be honored. However, existing pro-
     grams shall comply with this publication for (1) major modifications that affect the launch vehicle’s
     operation or safety characteristics; (2) new applications of previously approved components, systems,
     or subsystems; (3) discovery of previously undetected noncompliances; and (4) where hazard analy-
     ses, mishaps, incident investigations, or other sources indicate that the implementation of all or parts
     of this publication are necessary.

                             RESPONSIBILITIES AND AUTHORITIES

2.1. General. Range safety is a joint responsibility of the United States Air Force (USAF) as the owner
and operator of the ranges and of all Range Users. The responsibility for protecting the public, launch
area, and launch complex personnel and resources is of paramount consideration in range launch opera-
tions.

2.2. Headquarters Air Force Space Command Responsibilities. The Headquarters Air Force Space
Command (HQ AFSPC) operates the AFSPC ranges, including providing base support, personnel, and
other government assets. The AFSPC Commander (AFSPC/CC) is responsible for establishing range
safety policy for AFSPC ranges as outlined in AFSPCI91-701, Range Safety Program Policy and
Requirements. HQ AFSPC is also responsible for establishing common range safety user requirements as
outlined in this publication for the AFSPC space wings to implement and enforce.

2.3. Space Wing Responsibilities:
     2.3.1. Commanders, 30th Space Wing and 45th Space Wing:
        2.3.1.1. The Space Wing Commanders (SW/CCs) have overall authority and responsibility for
        public safety at AFSPC ranges as directed by the AFSPC/CC. This delegation is provided via the
        MAJCOM chain of command and AFI 91-202, as supplemented. Figure 2.1. shows the AFSPC
        Range Safety organizational structure.

        2.3.3.3. Range Differences. The WR and ER have some differences in Range Safety require-
        ments. The differences are caused by geographical differences that change risk levels for launch
        operations, organizational variations, and different Range User requirements such as those associ-
        ated with manned space flights at the ER and ballistic launches into the Reagan Test Site and air-
        craft tests at the WR. At present, where a requirement differs, the Range User may standardize to
        the more stringent requirement or meet the requirements of each range, whichever option is tech-
        nically or economically more desirable. Specific WR and ER differences are noted throughout this
        publication.
     2.3.4. Chiefs of Safety, 30th and 45th Space Wings. The Chiefs of Safety, 30th Space Wing (30

2.4. Federal Aviation Administration Responsibilities. In accordance with 49 U.S.C., Subtitle IX
Commercial Space Transportation, Chapter 701, Commercial Space Launch Activities, U.S.C. § § 70101
– 70121, the FAA has responsibility for public safety of licensed launches. The range safety requirements
in this publication have been written with the intent of achieving commonality with the FAA require-
ments. The FAA performed launch site safety assessments of the two AFSPC national launch ranges and
determined the level of safety obtained by the existing range safety processes to be adequate. The FAA
will not require a license applicant to demonstrate the adequacy of the range services it proposes to use if
the applicable launch site safety assessment included those services and if those services remain adequate.
SW Commander discretion to accept higher risk for the launch of government payloads does not apply to
licensed launches without a Range User obtaining relief from the FAA. (“Memorandum of Agreement
between the Department of the Air Force and Federal Aviation Administration on Safety for Space Trans-
portation and Range Activities,” dated 16 January 2001). FAA documents can be found on the FAA/AST
web site at http://ast.faa.gov.
   2.4.1. The FAA and the applicable Range Safety office shall jointly review and approve all requests
   by an FAA licensed launch operator (Range User) not to comply with any 14 CFR Part 417 Launch
   Safety requirement. Neither agency may overrule the other’s denial of a request for relief. The FAA
62                                                                 AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004


     shall document the findings/resolution of the joint review and provide copies to all participants. Range
     Safety shall act as the primary interface with the launch operator (Range User) for requests for relief
     and for tailoring.
     2.4.2. The FAA has the responsibility and authority to oversee the conduct of all licensed launches
     and may prohibit, suspend, or end immediately a licensed launch before flight if, at any time, the FAA
     determines the launch is detrimental to public health and safety, the safety of property, or any national
     security or foreign policy interest of the US.

        2.5.5.4. Maintaining an accurate written or computerized log of events during launch countdown
        for three years or three launches, whichever is greater.
     2.5.6. Control Authority Responsibilities. Range Users have the option to provide “operational
     safety control authority” within the launch complex. As defined in this publication, the control author-
     ity for safety includes areas within a complete launch complex (or missile silo) and adjacent facilities
     used by the control authority for launch vehicle and/or payload processing. If this option is used,
     Range Safety shall audit the program on an unannounced and periodic basis. Range Safety shall per-
     form these duties if a control authority is not qualified. Range Safety can assume these responsibilities
     for qualified control authorities, if requested. Pad Safety shall audit the program, perform duties, and
     assume responsibilities, if requested. When certified in accordance with the Launch Complex Safety
     Training and Certification Requirements, the “control authority” shall be responsible for the follow-
     ing: (See Attachment 7 of this volume for the Launch Complex Safety Training and Certification
     Requirements).
        2.5.6.1. Reviewing and approving all procedures relating to the performance of any hazardous
        operation and safety critical operation that are limited to launch complex safety.
        2.5.6.2. Reviewing and approving Facility Emergency Operating Plans (FEOPs) and OSPs that
        are limited to launch complex safety.
        2.5.6.3. Ensuring hazardous facilities and safety critical and hazardous operations limited to
        launch complex safety are periodically inspected, as required.
        2.5.6.4. Monitoring hazardous and safety critical operations that are limited to launch complex
        safety, as required.
        2.5.6.5. Defining the threat envelopes of all hazardous operations limited to launch complex
        safety and establishing safety clearance zones to protect launch complex personnel and resources.
        2.5.6.6. Ensuring that all personnel performing hazardous operations that are limited to launch
        complex safety are provided adequate training to ensure proper conduct of their jobs and tasks.
        2.5.6.7. Ensuring that adequate personal protective equipment is provided to launch complex per-
        sonnel as defined by this publication and approved OSPs.
        2.5.6.8. Ensuring that all hazardous operations affecting launch complex safety are conducted
        using formal written procedures approved in accordance with Attachment 7 of this volume.
     2.5.7. Occupational Safety and Health:
        2.5.7.1. Per AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Prevention,
        and Health (AFOSH) Program, Range Users (contractors/licensed launch operators/foreign enti-
        ties) are fully responsible for the safety and health of their employees in accordance with OSHA
        regulations/standards and other federal and state safety and health regulations. Further, they have
        an inherent responsibility to protect any government employees and property when such are
        involved in contractor operations or on contractor-leased facilities. Range Safety shall assume no
        liability for Range User or contractor compliance or noncompliance with OSHA requirements.
        2.5.7.2. USAF civilian and military personnel Range Users are required to comply with all DoD
        and Air Force safety and health requirements. Other DoD and federal government agency Range
        Users shall comply with their applicable safety and health requirements.

                                        RANGE SAFETY POLICY

3.1. General:
     3.1.1. It is the policy of the ranges to ensure that the risk to the public, launch area, and launch com-
     plex personnel and resources is managed to an acceptable level. This policy shall be implemented by
     employing risk management in three categories of safety: Public Safety, Launch Area Safety, and
     Launch Complex Safety.
     3.1.2. The Range User shall endeavor to manage risk to the lowest level, consistent with mission
     requirements, and in consonance with AFSPC range launch risk guidance. Individual hazardous activ-
     ities may exceed guidance based on national need after implementation of available cost-effective
     mitigation.
     3.1.3. It is the policy of the ranges to avoid the use of waivers. However, the SW Commanders have
     the authority to tailor or waive any requirement in this publication and to accept risks that exceed
     those defined in Table 3.1 and Figure 3.1 of this chapter for a specific mission based on national or
     mission needs. When the specific mission risks are greater than an expected casualty (Ec) of 300 x
     10-6, the SW Commanders shall advise the 14 AF/CC. Refer to AFSPCI91-701 for risk approval lev-
     els.
     3.1.4. Launch risk guidance has been established and can be found in 3.2 and 3.3 of this volume. Fur-
     ther information on acceptable risk criteria can be found in Attachment 4 of this volume.
     3.1.5. Imminent danger situations are subject to the following:
        3.1.5.1. Any operation, condition, or procedure that presents imminent danger shall be brought to
        the immediate attention of the supervisor or individual responsible for the immediate area.
        3.1.5.2. Immediate action shall be taken by the supervisor or individual responsible for the imme-
        diate area to correct the situation, apply interim control measures, stop the operation, and evacuate
        all personnel. The system, equipment, or facility shall be immediately placed in the safest condi-
        tion possible until the situation is resolved.
        3.1.5.3. All imminent danger situations shall be reported to Range Safety not later than 1 hour
        from the time the situation is identified.
        3.1.5.4. In an imminent danger situation, the system, equipment, or facility shall be immediately
        placed in the safest condition possible until the situation is resolved.

3.2. Public Safety. The ranges shall strive to ensure that the risk to the public, including foreign coun-
tries (personnel and resources), from range operations meets the criteria established in this publication.
Figure 3.1 shows the risk management criteria guidance for personnel to be used for determining accept-
able risk for individual launches. The value of 30 x 10-6 shall be used by the ranges as a level defining
“acceptable launch risk without SW Commander review.” Based on national need and the approval of the
SW Commanders, non-FAA licensed launches may be permitted using a predicted risk above 30 x 10-6.
Refer to AFSPCI91-701 for risk approval levels. Range Commanders Council Standard 321 provides rel-
evant background information on launch risk acceptability. The ranges and Range Users work together to
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004                                                                         67


determine risk based on data provided by Range Users and Range Safety models. See Attachment 4 of this
volume for definitions of terms and further guidance.

   3.2.1. Prelaunch and Launch Operations:
       3.2.1.1. Range Safety shall review, approve, and through Pad Safety, monitor, and impose safety
       holds, when necessary, on all prelaunch and launch operations conducted on the ranges. These
       actions are required to ensure that the hazards associated with propellants, ordnance, radioactive
       material, and other hazardous systems do not expose the public, launch area, or launch complex to
       risks greater than those considered acceptable by public law and state documents. These docu-
       ments include, but are not limited to, PL 99-499 42 U.S.C. 11001-11050, Superfund Amendments
       and Reauthorization Act (SARA), Title III: Emergency Planning and Community
       Right-to-Know Act (CPRCA); 29 CFR 1910.119, Process Safety Management of Highly Haz-
       ardous Chemicals; 40 CFR 355, Emergency Planning and Notification; 40 CFR 68, Chemical
       Accident Prevention Provisions, subpart G, Risk Management Plan; Executive Order 12856,
       Federal Compliance with Right-to-Know Laws and Pollution Prevention Requirements; and
       California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (CAL-OSHA).
       3.2.1.2. Range Safety shall conduct and oversee launch vehicle, payload, mission flight control,
       and Range Safety launch support operations to ensure that risks to the public, launch area, and
       launch complex do not exceed acceptable limits consistent with mission and national needs.
       3.2.1.3. Range Safety shall ensure that each Range User provides each launch system with a capa-
       bility that allows Range Safety to manually and positively initiate a holdfire that prevents launch
68                                                                 AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004


        in the event of loss of Range Safety critical systems or violation of mandatory Range Safety
        launch commit criteria (Volume 6, Attachment 7).
            3.2.1.3.1. Safety holds shall be initiated to prevent the start of a launch operation or to stop a
            launch operation that is already underway if it violates public, launch area, or launch complex
            safety or Range Safety launch commit criteria.
            3.2.1.3.2. Safety holds may be initiated by the MFCOs, Pad Safety Supervisor/Pad Safety
            Officer, Range Control Officers, Range Operations Commander (WR), Flight Safety Project
            Officer (WR), the Range User, FAA representative for licensed launches, or any responsible
            supervisor in charge of a launch operation.
        3.2.1.4. Quantity distance (QD) explosives siting shall be accomplished for all explosives facili-
        ties in accordance with AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards.
     3.2.2. Range Safety Critical Systems. Range Safety critical systems include all airborne and ground
     subsystems of the FSS. The FSS consists of airborne and ground FTSs, airborne and ground Range
     Tracking System (RTS), and the Telemetry Data Transmitting System (TDTS). The ground FSS also
     includes any hardware or software system, subsystem, or elements thereof that could prevent the
     MFCO from stopping the launch of a vehicle, determining the performance of a nominal or non-nom-
     inal launch vehicle, or commanding flight termination action, or could cause unauthorized issuance of
     FTS commands. Some other examples of Range Safety critical systems include, but are not limited to,
     the holdfire system, impact prediction system, Pad Safety Supervisor/Pad Safety Officer console, and
     the Flight Safety Project Officer (FSPO) console. Range Safety criticality shall be determined during
     initial acquisition activities by the Range Safety organization at the launch range. (See Volume 4 for
     further details.)
        3.2.2.1. All Range Safety critical systems shall be designed to ensure that no single point of fail-
        ure (SPOF), including both hardware and software, will deny the capability to monitor and termi-
        nate or result in the inadvertent termination of a launch vehicle or payload, as applicable.
        3.2.2.2. When possible, Range Safety critical systems shall be designed to be dual fault tolerant
        against failure in hardware and software and still provide overall system redundancy.
        3.2.2.3. The reliability requirements of the FSS are as follows:
            3.2.2.3.1. The overall airborne and ground FTS reliability goal is 0.9981 at the 95 percent
            confidence level.
                3.2.2.3.1.1. The airborne FTS reliability goal shall be a minimum of 0.999 at the 95 per-
                cent confidence level. This goal shall be met by combining the design approach and testing
                requirements of Volume 4 of this publication.
                3.2.2.3.1.2. The ground FTS shall have a reliability of 0.999 at the 95 percent confidence
                level for a 4-hour duration, as required.
            3.2.2.3.2. The overall airborne and ground RTS reliability is a function of the following
            requirements:
                3.2.2.3.2.1. The airborne RTS reliability shall be 0.995 at the 95 percent confidence level
                for transponder systems and 0.999 at the 95 percent confidence level for global positioning
                systems. These requirements shall be met by combining the design approach and testing
                requirements of Volume 4 of this publication.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004                                                                           69


              3.2.2.3.2.2. The ground RTS reliability shall be 0.999 at the 95 percent confidence level
              for a 1-hour duration, as required.
           3.2.2.3.3. The reliability requirement for the TDTS is the same as that for the airborne and
           ground RTS when the TDTS is used to provide tracking data.
       3.2.2.4. Other systems determined to be Range Safety critical shall have a design reliability of
       0.999 at the 95 percent confidence level.
   3.2.3. Control of Errant Vehicle Flight:
       3.2.3.1. Range Safety shall verify that all launch vehicles launched from or onto the ranges have
       a positive, range-approved method of controlling errant vehicle flight to meet the objective of
       minimizing risks to the public, launch area, and launch complex personnel and resources. Nor-
       mally, control systems on launch vehicles using the ranges shall consist of an airborne FSS that
       shall meet all the requirements of volumes 2 and 4 of this publication. A thrust termination system
       may be considered as an alternative to an FSS; however, quantification of risks shall be deter-
       mined, and the requirements in Volume 2 shall be met. The alternative thrust termination concept
       and design shall be approved by the SW Commander.
       3.2.3.2. Range Safety shall establish flight termination criteria and Range Safety mission flight
       rules to ensure that operations do not exceed acceptable public safety limits. At the ER, mission
       rules and flight termination policy for the space transportation system (STS) shall be in accor-
       dance with the Johnson Space Center Operational Flight Rules, Rules and Agreements, Section R.
       3.2.3.3. Range Safety shall establish and control hazardous launch areas and procedures to protect
       the public on land, on the sea, and in the air for each launch and launch vehicle using the ranges
       and to ensure the following criteria are met:
           3.2.3.3.1. No intact launch vehicle, scheduled debris or payload, or launch vehicle and pay-
           load subsystems shall be allowed to intentionally impact on land except in the launch area
           inside the impact limit lines. Note: There may be missions that require no intact impact on
           land areas (for example, a nuclear payload launch) that may drive additional mitigation tech-
           niques or augmentation to ensure vehicle or stage destruct capability inside the impact limit
           lines.
           3.2.3.3.2. Flight paths and trajectories shall be designed so that normal impact dispersion
           areas do not encompass land.
           3.2.3.3.3. Safety margins shall be used to avoid overly restrictive flight termination (destruct)
           limits.
       3.2.3.4. Range Safety policy may allow errant launch vehicles to fly to obtain maximum data
       until they would present an unacceptable risk to the public or until Range Safety can no longer
       control the launch vehicle.

3.3. Launch Area Safety. The following requirements are in addition to those specifically identified for
launch area safety in 3.2 of this volume. (See Attachment 4 of this volume and Volume 7 of this publica-
tion for the definitions of terms related to risk.)
70                                                                AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004


     3.3.1. The ranges shall ensure that all personnel and USAF or third party resources located on any
     AFSPC range, including CCAFS or VAFB or on any supporting site within the ER or WR, are pro-
     vided an acceptable degree of protection from the hazards associated with range operations.
     3.3.2. Figure 3.2. shows nominal launch area and launch complex hazard consequence and probabil-
     ity categories correlated to different levels of acceptability for prelaunch hazards not associated with
     launch or Range Safety launch commit criteria. Numbers provided in Figure 3.2. are guides only and
     are not necessarily hard limits.

     3.3.3. Launch-Essential Personnel. Allowable collective risk for launch-essential launch area person-
     nel is 300 x 10-6. Allowable individual risk for launch-essential personnel is 10 x 10-6.
        3.3.3.1. Launch-essential personnel are those persons necessary to safely and successfully com-
        plete a specific/current hazardous operation or launch.
        3.3.3.2. Launch-essential personnel include supporting personnel required to perform emergency
        actions according to authorized directives and persons in training to perform emergency actions.
        3.3.3.3. Range Safety and the Range User jointly determine the number of launch-essential per-
        sonnel allowed in safety clearance zones and hazardous launch areas with the concurrence of the
        SW Commanders.
     3.3.4. The SW Commanders can allow for neighboring operations personnel to be assessed at the
     same risk level as launch-essential personnel (300 x 10-6).
     3.3.5. Range Safety shall conduct risk studies and analyses to determine the risk levels, define accept-
     able risk levels, and develop exposure criteria for launch area and launch complex safety.
     3.3.6. Range Safety shall establish design criteria and controls, procedures, and processes to mini-
     mize personnel risks and ensure acceptable launch area and launch complex risk levels are not
     exceeded.
     3.3.7. Range Safety shall evaluate all launch vehicle, payload, ground support, and facility systems
     used on the ranges to test, checkout, assemble, handle, support, or launch space launch vehicles or
     payloads with regard to their hazard potential and ensure they are designed to minimize risks to per-
     sonnel and fall within acceptable exposure levels for launch area and launch complex safety.
     3.3.8. Range Safety shall ensure that all hazardous operations affecting launch area and launch com-
     plex safety are identified and conducted using Range Safety or Safety Control Authority (if procedure
     hazards are limited to launch complex safety) approved formal written procedures. Through Pad
     Safety, Range Safety shall ensure launch area and launch complex safety is provided in accordance
     with this publication and approved OSPs.
     3.3.9. Range Safety shall define the threat envelope of all hazardous operations affecting launch area
     and launch complex safety and establish safety clearance zones to protect personnel and resources. A
     minimum number of personnel shall be exposed to the minimum hazard level consistent with efficient
     task accomplishment.
     3.3.10. Range Users shall ensure all personnel performing hazardous operations that may impact
     launch area or launch complex safety are provided adequate training to ensure proper conduct of their
     jobs and tasks by reviewing Range User training plans. Range Safety may review the Range User
     training plans to ensure compliance.
     3.3.11. Launch Area Resource Safety. Resource safety, formerly known as resource protection, is the
     protection of facilities, support equipment, or other property from damage due to mishaps.
        3.3.11.1. The SW Commanders shall ensure range-owned resources are protected. Where govern-
        ment property or facilities are leased to launch system operators, the SW Commanders shall
        ensure the government agency responsible for the resource identifies the requirements for
        resource safety in the appropriate lease agreements.

       3.3.11.2. Procedures and policies that are applied for public and launch area safety shall be used
       to reduce risks to launch area USAF and third party physical resources to acceptable levels.
       3.3.11.3. Siting, design, and use of USAF and third party physical resources shall consider poten-
       tial hazards and threat envelopes to ensure that damage exposure is limited to acceptable levels as
       defined by federal law and national consensus standards.
       3.3.11.4. USAF squadron/detachment commanders shall be responsible for implementing
       resource safety requirements for all USAF flight hardware, ground support equipment, and facili-
       ties within their assigned areas.
       3.3.11.5. The US Navy, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other
       government tenant organizations shall be responsible for all tenant-occupied facilities and ten-
       ant-owned equipment.
       3.3.11.6. The installation commander shall be responsible for implementation of resource safety
       requirements for an area on the installation not assigned to a specific USAF squadron/detachment
       commander or other Range User. The installation commanders at the ER are the Cape Commander
       for CCAFS and the Wing Commander for Patrick Air Force Base. The installation commander at
       the WR is the Wing Commander for Vandenberg Air Force Base.
       3.3.11.7. Commercial Range Users (contractors or licensed launch operators) shall be responsible
       for commercially owned, leased, or licensed physical resources, including facilities, equipment,
       and flight hardware.

3.4. Launch Complex Safety. The following requirements are in addition to those also specifically iden-
tified for launch complex safety in 3.2 and 3.3 of this volume.
   3.4.1. As the control authority, the single contractor or licensed launch operator, full-time government
   tenant organization, or USAF squadron/detachment commander has the responsibility for launch
   complex safety and shall exercise the function in accordance with the Launch Complex Safety Train-
   ing and Certification requirements. The control authority may delegate this responsibility to the
   Chiefs of Safety.
   3.4.2. The Chiefs of Safety shall review and approve all hazardous procedures and any procedures
   that may pose or induce a hazardous condition.
   3.4.3. If the Range User is operating under a government contract, the government agency owning the
   contract shall ensure the launch provider is adequately protecting government interests within the
   terms and conditions of the contract.
   3.4.4. When hazards extend to range assets or the general public, the SW Commander has the ulti-
   mate responsibility to ensure proper safety through an appropriate level of oversight into Range User
   operations.

                                                CHAPTER 4

                                     RANGE SAFETY PROCESSES

4.1. Range Safety and Range User Interface Process. Due to the complexity of present launch vehicle
programs, early Range Safety and Range User planning will lead to a cost effective safety program and
reduce potential schedule impacts. The goal of the interface process is to provide final approvals for
launch as early as possible. Range Users will first be introduced to Range Safety through the SW/XP
office or, as applicable, through the sponsoring Range User. The PM will assist in establishing interfaces
with other SW offices for safety-related purposes. Range Users are strongly encouraged to solicit Range
Safety participation in the development of programmatic documentation such as requests for proposals,
source selection processes, concept developments, preliminary/subsequent design reviews, statements of
work, and contract data requirements lists. It is not the intent of this publication or the interface process to
stifle ingenuity, new technology, state-of-the-art development, or unique solutions to safety problems.
Instead, the interface process ensures that Range Safety and Range Users understand the requirements of
this publication and reach mutual agreement on compliance methods early in the program.

4.2. Range Safety Concept-to-Launch Process. The overall Range Safety process from “concept to
launch” for new launch vehicles is shown in Attachment 8, Figure A.1. This process can be tailored to
apply to payloads, ground support equipment, critical facilities, and/or hazardous and safety critical oper-
ations. The top row of boxes represents the sub-processes for establishing the program concept and appli-
cable Range Safety requirements per this publication. The second row of boxes represents the
sub-processes for analysis, design, and testing for the program per volumes 2 through 5 of this publica-
tion. The third row of boxes represents the sub-processes for operations and launch at the ranges per vol-
umes 1 and 6 of this publication. The details of this process can be found in volumes 2 through 6 of this
publication, as indicated. In addition, Eastern and Western Range 127-1, Range Safety Requirements,
Range User Handbook, describes this process in greater detail. Attachment 6 of this volume contains a
detailed tailored version of this process specifically developed for generic payloads and payload buses.

4.3. Initial Range Safety and Range User Technical Interchange Meeting:
     4.3.1. During the concept phase of a program, Range Users shall contact Range Safety to arrange an
     initial technical interchange meeting (TIM) through the 30/45 SW/XP office. The purpose of this
     meeting is to present program concepts regarding flight plans; launch complex selection; launch vehi-
     cle, payload, and ground support equipment; the FSS; and facility design, operations, and launch com-
     plex safety responsibility to determine if there are any major safety concerns that could impact the
     program.
     4.3.2. This TIM may occur at anytime but shall be no later than the formal program introduction (PI)
     via the 30/45 SW/XP office. The cost of the initial interface meetings will not be charged to the Range
     User as long as the workload associated with this activity is insignificant in scope.

4.4. Tailoring Process:
     4.4.1. If desired by the Range User, Range Safety and the Range User shall jointly develop a tailored
     edition of this publication for the program. The purpose of tailoring the publication is to ensure that
     only applicable requirements are identified and to determine whether or not the requirement will be
     met as written or through an alternative means that will provide an ELS.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004                                                                             75


   4.4.2. Requirements in this publication are subject to tailoring within limits, including detailed
   design, performance, operating, and documentation requirements. Consideration is given to applica-
   bility, design pedigree and complexity, state of the art technology, cost, and risk. Details of the tailor-
   ing process can be found in Attachment 1 of this volume.
   4.4.3. Tailoring, if desired, should begin at the earliest opportunity and finish no later than 30 days
   after the critical design review. Tailored documents may be changed after initial approval if necessary,
   but must go through the approval process again to accept changes.
   4.4.4. The FAA shall be included in the tailoring process for licensed programs at AFSPC ranges per
   the memorandum of agreement between HQ AFSPC and the FAA/AST on Resolving Requests for
   Relief from Common Launch Safety Requirements. Although the tailoring may reference waivers,
   waivers shall be approved through a separate waiver process. ELS determinations are normally docu-
   mented as part of the tailoring process.

4.5. Other Range Safety and Range User TIMs and Reviews. Range Safety and Range Users shall
jointly agree to arrange the following TIMs and reviews as necessary:
   4.5.1. Flight Safety TIMs [Preliminary Flight Data Package (PFDP) and/or Final Flight Data Package
   (FFDP), Volume 2].
   4.5.2. Combined or independent safety reviews in association with the Concept Design Review
   (cDR), Preliminary Design Review (PDR), and Critical Design Review (CDR) for launch vehicle,
   payload, and associated ground support equipment design [Missile System Prelaunch Safety Package
   (MSPSP), Volume 3], airborne FSS and associated ground support equipment design [Flight Termina-
   tion System Report (FTSR), Volume 4], critical facility design [Facility Safety Data Package (FSDP),
   Volume 5], and ground operations plans (GOPs), Volume 6.
      4.5.2.1. cDRs shall provide design and operations detail to at least the system level.
      4.5.2.2. PDRs shall provide design and operations detail to at least the subsystem and box level.
      4.5.2.3. CDRs shall provide design and operating detail to the component and piece part level.
   4.5.3. Hazardous and safety critical procedures TIMs (Volume 6) and other TIMs, reviews, and meet-
   ings, as necessary

4.6. ELS Determinations and Waivers:
   4.6.1. General. Range Users shall identify the need for any potential ELS determination and/or
   waiver regarding requirements in this publication to Range Safety for resolution. Potential ELS deter-
   minations or waivers shall be identified and presented to the Range Safety approval authority at the
   earliest possible time, preferably no later than the cDR. Details and requirements for submitting non-
   compliance requests can be found in Attachment 3 of this volume.
   4.6.2. ELS Determination. The phrase ELS means an approximately equal level of safety. An ELS
   may involve a change to the level of expected risk that is not statistically or mathematically significant
   as determined by qualitative or quantitative risk analysis. ELS determination made by AFSPC ranges
   have been referred to in the past as meets intent certifications. ELS determinations are normally incor-
   porated during the tailoring process.
   4.6.3. Waivers:
76                                                              AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004


        4.6.3.1. The term waiver refers to a decision that allows a Range User to continue with a launch,
        including launch process, even though the Range User does not satisfy a specific safety require-
        ment and is not able to demonstrate an ELS. A waiver applies where a failure to satisfy a safety
        requirement involves a statistically or mathematically significant increase in expected risk as
        determined through quantitative or qualitative risk analysis, and the activity may or may not
        exceed the public risk criteria.
        4.6.3.2. Waivers to the requirements shall be granted only in extremely unique or compelling cir-
        cumstances and only when the mission objectives of the Range User cannot otherwise be
        achieved. Range Safety and the Range User shall jointly endeavor to ensure that all requirements
        of this publication are met as early in the design and operation process as possible to limit the
        number of required waivers to an absolute minimum.
        4.6.3.3. Waivers shall always have the effectivity designated. A “get-well” plan shall be required
        except for those with lifetime effectivity.
        4.6.3.4. The FAA shall be included in the waiver process for licensed programs at AFSPC ranges
        per the memorandum of agreement between HQ AFSPC and FAA/AST on Resolving Requests for
        Relief from Common Launch Safety Requirements.
        4.6.3.5. The SW Commanders shall approve or disapprove all waivers affecting public safety.
        4.6.3.6. The Chiefs of Safety or their designated representatives shall approve or disapprove all
        waivers other than those affecting public safety.
     4.6.4. Submittal. The Range User shall submit all waiver requests for review and approval sepa-
     rately. ELS determinations shall normally be documented as part of the tailoring process. All
     approved waivers and ELS determinations shall be included in the appropriate safety data package as
     an appendix.
     4.6.5. Every applicable waiver shall be reviewed for validity prior to each launch or launch cycle.
     The Range User shall present a synopsis of each applicable waiver with the rationale concerning its
     viability for review and approval by Range Safety.

4.7. Changes to Approved Generic Systems:
     4.7.1. Once baseline or generic launch systems, including launch vehicles, payloads, ground support
     equipment, FSSs, and critical facilities have been approved, only those systems and subsystems that
     change shall be submitted to Range Safety for review and approval. The approval process remains the
     same as described in this publication and is subject to the requirements in 1.2.3. of this volume.
     Attachment 6 of this volume provides a tailored process for the approval of generic payloads.
     4.7.2. Documentation shall be marked or labeled as “Mission Unique,” “Upgrade,” “Change,” or
     “Other” to the previously approved system and shall be prepared in such a manner to allow easy ref-
     erence to previously approved submittals.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004                                                                        77


                                             CHAPTER 5

       SAFETY AUTHORIZATIONS, SAFETY APPROVALS, AND DOCUMENTATION

5.1. General. Range Users are solely responsible for obtaining the identified mandatory authorizations
and approvals necessary for operating on or launching from the ranges. Also, Range Users are responsible
for providing the documentation necessary to show compliance or the rationale for obtaining ELS deter-
minations or waivers to the requirements identified in this publication (See also 4.6).

5.2. Safety Authorizations:
   5.2.1. Programs launching from the AFSPC ranges shall obtain authorizations from the appropriate
   authority.
   5.2.2. Programs operating from an AFSPC range shall use an FTS that is jointly approved for flight at
   all AFSPC ranges. This includes government and FAA-licensed programs. Departures from this pol-
   icy shall be approved by all AFSPC ranges. Departures from this policy shall not be approved unless
   Range Users sign a letter acknowledging that they will be solely responsible for any additional costs
   resulting from a decision to operate at another AFSPC range.
   5.2.3. Programs launching from AFSPC ranges shall obtain authorizations for common requirements
   from the appropriate SW authorities.
       5.2.3.1. Unique requirements shall require authorizations from the appropriate SW authority.
       5.2.3.2. In general, if a program is approved at either of the current AFSPC ranges (ER or WR), it
       will be approved at the other range. However, for approval to occur, a streamlined review of the
       following items shall take place: all Range Safety required documentation, AFSPCMAN 91-710
       tailoring noncompliances, and agreements made between the Range User and the originating
       Range Safety Office. The Range User shall also address applicable ER or WR unique require-
       ments that are not subject to the original approval. Updates to existing Range Safety documenta-
       tion, particularly the SAR, GOP, and hazardous or safety critical procedures shall normally be
       required due to the change in the operating location.

5.3. Safety Approvals:
   5.3.1. SW Commanders. The following safety approvals shall be authorized only by the SW Com-
   manders:
       5.3.1.1. Tailored versions of AFSPCMAN 91-710 affecting public safety.
       5.3.1.2. Co-signatory with NASA/Johnson Space Center on STS Range Safety Flight Rules,
       including termination criteria.
       5.3.1.3. Range Safety launch commit criteria for all launch vehicles.

        5.3.2.9. FSDP (Volume 5, Attachment 1).
        5.3.2.10. Hazardous and Safety Critical Procedures (Volume 1 and Attachments 1 and 2 of Vol-
        ume 6).
        5.3.2.11. Range Safety Launch Operations Approval Letter (Volumes 1 and 6).
            5.3.2.11.1. WR. A Range Safety Launch Operations Approval Letter to launch from or onto
            the WR shall be provided to the Range User no later than the scheduled LRR conducted before
            a planned launch operation. Receipt of this letter depends on the Range User having obtained
            the previously required approvals described in this volume.
            5.3.2.11.2. ER. Launch Operations Approval Letters are not normally used on the ER. Wing
            Safety’s GO at the LRR constitutes approval to launch and is contingent upon the Range User
            having obtained the required approvals identified in this volume. However, a Range Safety
            Launch Operations Approval Letter can be provided, if requested.
            5.3.2.11.3. Lack of launch operations approval may result in the launch being withdrawn from
            the Range schedule.
        5.3.2.12. Final Range Safety Approval for Launch (Volumes 1 and 6).
            5.3.2.12.1. Holdfire checks, flight safety system checks, and other safety critical checks shall
            be performed satisfactorily; environmental conditions shall be met; and all Range Safety
            launch commit criteria shall be “green” before final approval to launch.
            5.3.2.12.2. Given that holdfire checks, flight safety system checks, other safety critical
            checks, and environmental conditions are satisfactory and all Range Safety launch commit cri-
            teria are “green,” Range Safety shall provide a final approval to launch as follows: At the ER,
            the Chief of Safety provides approval by relaying to the MFCO, “CLEAR TO LAUNCH.” At
            the WR, the MFCO issues a GREEN to go electronically and a verbal call “Safety is sending a
            green.”
        5.3.2.13. Range Safety instrumentation, tracking, data, and display requirements for all launch
        vehicles.

5.4. Other Required Approvals:
   5.4.1. Explosives Site Plans. Explosives site plans require the signature of a member of the Depart-
   ment of Defense Explosive Safety Board (DDESB).
   5.4.2. Use of Radioactive Sources for Space Operations. The use of radioactive sources for space
   operations requires approval in accordance with the procedures in Volume 3.

5.5. Documentation and Data Requirements. Volumes 2 through 6 of this publication have “Docu-
mentation Requirements” or “Data Requirements” sections that describe the information that shall be sub-
mitted and the processes that shall be used to obtain the necessary approvals to operate at the ranges. In
addition, attachments in all volumes provide detailed document content requirements that shall be met.
All other documentation noted in the specific volumes shall also be approved as indicated in the respec-
tive volumes. While developing the required documentation, Range Users are encouraged to work closely
with Range Safety to facilitate the approval process. The Eastern and Western Range 127-1, Range Safety
Requirements, Range User Handbook provides additional helpful information regarding documentation
requirements. The Range User is responsible for providing the following documents (not all inclusive):
   5.5.1. Tailored version of AFSPCMAN 91-710, if desired (Attachment 1 of this volume).
   5.5.2. Tailored version of an SSPP (Attachment 2 of this volume).

                INVESTIGATING AND REPORTING MISHAPS AND INCIDENTS

6.1. Mishaps and Incidents Involving Air Force Personnel and Resources. In accordance with AFI
91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, the ranges shall investigate and report all mishaps and inci-
dents involving USAF personnel and resources.

6.2. Non-Air Force Personnel and Resources:
     6.2.1. The AFSPC ranges shall not report or investigate non-Air Force mishaps under AFI 91-204
     auspices. However, Range Safety shall assist and participate in non-Air Force mishap investigations
     that affect or could affect public safety, launch area safety, or Air Force resources and may assist in
     non-Air Force mishap investigations that affect or could affect launch complex safety or non-Air
     Force third party resources.
     6.2.2. Range Safety shall be provided with the investigation results of any mishaps or incidents
     occurring on the ranges.
     6.2.3. Regardless of the Range User, the SW Commander may conduct formal investigations into any
     mishap and incident that affects or could affect public safety, launch area safety, or launch complex
     safety. However, the scope of such an investigation into contractor mishaps is limited to the protection
     of the public, other Range Users, and Air Force personnel and resources.

6.3. Reporting Space Launch System Anomalies. Any anomaly with potential safety implications
occurring in a launch vehicle or system during prelaunch processing, launch, flight, or post-launch pro-
cessing shall be promptly reported to Range Safety for review. Range Users shall notify the Range Safety
office of all anomaly reviews/meetings prior to the review/meeting and shall provide copies of the brief-
ings, reports, meeting minutes, and actions identified and taken to address the anomalies.

                              CHANGES TO THIS PUBLICATION

7.1. This publication shall normally be updated at least once every four years; however, it may be
updated more frequently, if required. If circumstances warrant, revisions may be made on a vol-
ume-by-volume basis.

7.2. Permanent changes shall be performed in accordance with the requirements in Attachment 5 of this
volume.

7.3. Changes requiring immediate attention, such as those based on a previously unknown risk or safety
compromise, shall be made as necessary and distributed as Change Notices.

7.4. All changes to this publication shall be coordinated among the AFSPC ranges before being submit-
ted to HQ AFSPC/SEC for incorporation. All affected Range Users shall be informed of any changes to
this publication.

                             RANGE USER INFORMATION SOURCES

8.1. Range User Handbook. The Eastern and Western Range 127-1, Range Safety Requirements,
Range User Handbook is available to all Range Users. This handbook provides informational tools to
help Range Users achieve the Range Safety “concept-to-launch” process in the most efficient manner pos-
sible. Contact the Range Safety Office to obtain a copy or download the handbook from the Range Safety
web site.

8.2. Organization of the Volumes:
     8.2.1. Main Chapters. The main chapters of this publication include common requirements for all
     vehicle classes. Appendixes include additional requirements to supplement the main chapters.
     8.2.2. Open Text. The open text contains the actual mandatory performance-based requirements. The
     only tailoring expected for these requirements would be the deletion of non-applicable requirements.
     For example, solid rocket motor performance requirements would be deleted for launch systems that
     do not use solid rocket motors.
     8.2.3. Bordered Paragraphs:
        8.2.3.1. Bordered paragraphs are non-mandatory and are used to identify some of the potential
        detailed technical solutions that meet the performance requirements. In addition, the bordered
        paragraphs contain lessons learned from previous applications of the performance requirement,
        where a certain design may have been found successful, or have been tried and failed to meet the
        requirement. These technical solutions are provided for the following reasons:
            8.2.3.1.1. To aid the tailoring process between Range Safety and Range Users in evaluating a
            potential system against all the performance requirements.
            8.2.3.1.2. To aid Range Safety and Range Users in implementing lessons learned.
            8.2.3.1.3. To provide benchmarks that demonstrate what Range Safety considers an accept-
            able technical solution/implementation of the performance requirement and to help convey the
            level of safety the performance requirement is intended to achieve.
        8.2.3.2. The technical solutions in the bordered paragraphs may be adopted into the tailored ver-
        sion of the requirements for a specific program when the Range User intends to use that solution
        to meet the performance requirement. At this point, they become mandatory requirements to
        obtain Range Safety approval. This process is done to:
            8.2.3.2.1. Provide an appropriate level of detail necessary for contractual efforts and to pro-
            mote efficiency in the design process.
            8.2.3.2.2. Avoid contractual misunderstandings that experience has shown often occur if an
            appropriate level of detail is not agreed to. The level of detail in the bordered paragraphs is
            necessary to avoid costly out-of-scope contractual changes and to prevent inadvertently over-
            looking a critical technical requirement.
        8.2.3.3. The Range User always has the option to propose alternatives to the bordered paragraph
        solutions. Range User proposed alternative solutions shall achieve an equivalent level of safety
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004                                                                       83


       and be approved by Range Safety. After meeting these two requirements, the Range User pro-
       posed solutions become part of the tailored AFSPCMAN 91-710 for that specific program.
       8.2.3.4. Range Safety has final decision authority in determining whether Range User proposed
       detailed technical solutions meet AFSPCMAN 91-710 performance requirements.

                          THE AFSPCMAN 91-710 TAILORING PROCESS

A1.1. Introduction:
     A1.1.1. Purpose. Tailoring provides a means for formulating a specific edition of AFSPCMAN
     91-710, incorporating only those requirements that apply to a particular Range User program. Addi-
     tionally, tailoring documents whether or not the Range User will meet the requirements as written or
     achieve an ELS through an acceptable alternative. A tailored version of the publication is denoted as
     AFSPCMAN 91-710 Tailored [T]. Programs that launch from only one of the AFSPC ranges shall be
     tailored by the appropriate SW/SE section. A combined 30/45 SW/SE team shall tailor programs that
     intend to launch from more than one of the AFSPC ranges. The FAA shall be included in the tailoring
     process for licensed programs at AFSPC ranges. Programs launching from AFSPC ranges shall have
     an FTS that is jointly approved for flight at all ranges for all launching vehicles (government or FAA
     licensed). Departures from this policy shall be approved by all affected ranges. Tailoring refers to the
     process used at AFSPC ranges beginning at program introduction (PI) where AFSPC (Range Safety)
     organizations and a Range User review each safety requirement and jointly document whether or not
     the requirement is applicable to the Range User; and if it is applicable, whether or not the Range User
     will meet the requirement as written or achieve an ELS through an acceptable alternative. If devel-
     oped, the tailored edition shall be placed on the Range User’s contract or applied through a Commer-
     cial Space Operations Support Agreement.
     A1.1.2. Content. This attachment describes the rationale for tailoring, the tailoring process, and the
     requirements for documenting tailored editions of the publication.
     A1.1.3. Applicability. The tailoring process is applicable to all programs (boosters, solid rocket
     motors, upper stages, payloads, associated ground support equipment and facilities). The tailoring
     process is optional for new programs and existing programs where Range Safety and the Range User
     agree this process would be effective.
     A1.1.4. Formation of a High Performance Work Team. A high performance work team (HPWT)
     shall be formed to perform tailoring during TIMs. HPWT membership shall include Range User and
     Range Safety personnel who have specific tailoring authority.
     A1.1.5. Tailoring Rationale. Tailoring shall be accomplished based on the following rationale
     described below. Alternative means of identifying deletions, changes, additions, and Range User
     information are allowable provided that they are distinguishable from the original text and each other
     and are mutually agreed to by the Range User and Range Safety.
        A1.1.5.1. Deletion of a Requirement:
            A1.1.5.1.1. When a requirement is not applicable to a Range User program, the requirement
            shall be deleted.
            A1.1.5.1.2. The original paragraph number and headings shall remain, but the non-applicable
            text shall be removed and replaced with the abbreviation N/A.
        A1.1.5.2. Change to a Requirement:
            A1.1.5.2.1. ELS determinations may be provided and approved by the HPWT through the
            change process; however, the HPWT cannot provide or approve waivers.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004                                                                       85


        A1.1.5.2.2. A change is allowed to tailor the requirement to a particular system as long as the
        intent of the requirement is met and the ELS is maintained.
        A1.1.5.2.3. The change shall be written in the place of the original requirement.
        A1.1.5.2.4. The existing numbering system shall remain the same to the maximum extent pos-
        sible.
        A1.1.5.2.5. Additional paragraphs may be added; however, using the remaining unaffected
        paragraph numbers is not allowed.
        A1.1.5.2.6. All changes shall be highlighted in bold. Deletions of text, including partial dele-
        tions, shall be shown with the original text marked with strikethrough. Insertions of text,
        including partial insertions, shall be shown with the new text marked with underline.
     A1.1.5.3. Addition to a Requirement:
        A1.1.5.3.1. An addition to a requirement is allowed when there are no existing requirements
        addressing new technology, when unforeseen hazards are discovered, when federal or industry
        standards change, and for similar reasons.
        A1.1.5.3.2. An addition shall be added with new paragraph numbers in the section for which
        it is appropriate or in a new section if no other section applies.
        A1.1.5.3.3. All changes shall be highlighted in bold. Insertions/additions of text, including
        partial insertions, shall be shown with the new text marked with underline.
     A1.1.5.4. Range User Information Only:
        A1.1.5.4.1. Requirements having only an indirect effect on the Range User but which are still
        required of the program as a whole shall remain in the tailored publication as information only.
        Examples of such requirements include Pad Safety responsibilities, other range contractor
        responsibilities, and Range User facilities manager responsibilities.
        A1.1.5.4.2. All “Range User Information Only” requirements shall be highlighted with an
        asterisk before the affected paragraph.
     A1.1.5.5. Waivers. Waivers are not rationale for the deletion of requirements. The requirements
     shall remain in the AFSPCMAN 91-710[T] and the waiver process shall be used for the disposi-
     tion of the requirement.
     A1.1.5.6. Risk-Cost Benefit Analysis:
        A1.1.5.6.1. Technical issues regarding such items as applicable requirements, policy, criteria,
        or data may be evaluated on a risk-cost benefit basis to determine if the risk is acceptable to
        waive the requirements.
        A1.1.5.6.2. A risk-cost benefit analysis, based on the criteria defined in Figure 3.1 and Table
        3.1 of Chapter 3 of this volume, shall be submitted to Range Safety.
        A1.1.5.6.3. Based on risk-cost benefit analysis data, Range Safety and the Range User shall
        reach agreement on the disposition of the requirement in question.
        A1.1.5.6.4. If the application of an AFSPCMAN 91-710 requirement results in significant
        reduction in risk at a significant cost benefit, it may be determined by Range Safety to be suf-
        ficient to impose the requirement; however, if the benefit is insignificant and/or the cost is
86                                                              AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004


           high, the requirement may be waived or determined to provide an ELS, all with consideration
           for public safety.
     A1.1.6. Scheduling Technical Interchange Meetings:
        A1.1.6.1. TIMs are required for Range Users to present their systems to Range Safety and to par-
        ticipate in the active tailoring of the publication.
        A1.1.6.2. TIMs shall be scheduled as early in the program as possible when program definition is
        sufficient to make the meetings worthwhile and structured so that technical tailoring is completed
        before contractual tailoring (wordsmithing) is started.
        A1.1.6.3. AFSPCMAN 91-710[T] TIM data shall be provided to Range Safety at least 30 days
        before scheduled TIMs.

A1.2. Tailoring Process:
     A1.2.1. Preparation of an Optional Draft Edition of AFSPCMAN 91-710:
        A1.2.1.1. If desired, the Range User and/or Range Safety may produce an optional draft edition of
        AFSPCMAN 91-710[T] based on conceptual data and meetings.
        A1.2.1.2. The purpose of a draft AFSPCMAN 91-710 [T] is to eliminate all non-applicable
        requirements, leaving only applicable requirements from which detailed tailoring can be per-
        formed.
        A1.2.1.3. The draft AFSPCMAN 91-710 [T] shall be delivered as soon as possible and is negotia-
        ble.
     A1.2.2. Generation of Tailoring Requests:
        A1.2.2.1. AFSPCMAN 91-710 [T] Tailoring Requests shall be used to document proposed
        AFSPCMAN 91-710 [T] deletions, changes, and additions.
        A1.2.2.2. Tailoring Requests should be completed before scheduled TIMs and submitted to
        Range Safety for review or they may be completed during TIMs. An example of a tailoring
        request is in the Eastern and Western Range 127-1, Range Safety Requirements, Range User
        Handbook.
        A1.2.2.3. The forms for submitting Tailoring Requests are available from the Range Safety
        offices. Range Users shall submit Tailoring Requests in writing using any format containing the
        same information as the Tailoring Request form, if mutually agreed to by the Range User and
        Range Safety.
        A1.2.2.4. Completing Tailoring Requests:
           A1.2.2.4.1. The original AFSPCMAN 91-710 paragraph number, original (or summarized, if
           sufficiently detailed) text, tailored paragraph number, proposed text, and the rationale for the
           change shall be included.
           A1.2.2.4.2. Deletions of requirements that are non-applicable and need no formal explanation
           may all be listed on one or more Tailoring Request forms.
           A1.2.2.4.3. Tailoring Requests dealing with similar or related requirements and rationale may
           all be combined on the same Tailoring Request form.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004                                                                     87


     A1.2.2.5. Disposition of Tailoring Requests:
        A1.2.2.5.1. If necessary, Range Safety shall comment on the proposed change and dispose of
        it as “approved as written,” “approved with provided comments,” or “disapproved.”
        A1.2.2.5.2. When agreement is reached and a Tailoring Request is approved, Range Safety
        and Range User representatives shall sign and date the form.
  A1.2.3. Publication of AFSPCMAN 91-710 [T]:
     A1.2.3.1. Final Publication:
        A1.2.3.1.1. The goal for final publication of an AFSPCMAN 91-710 [T] is as soon as possi-
        ble, but should be no later than 30 days after the CDR. Tailoring can be an ongoing process
        and tailored documents should be considered living documents that may change throughout
        the life of the program.
        A1.2.3.1.2. In some cases, it may be necessary to complete the AFSPCMAN 91-710 [T] as
        part of the contracting process or at some other point before the PDR. In these cases, Range
        Safety will work with the Range User to establish and meet a completion date for AFSPC-
        MAN 91-710 [T] publication.
     A1.2.3.2. The tailored edition shall look like AFSPCMAN91-710 with the following excep-
     tions::
        A1.2.3.2.1. The document title/heading shall read, "AFSPCMAN91-710VX TAILORED
        FOR Program Name". This title shall be centered at the top of each page..
        A1.2.3.2.2. The date of the applicable contract/CSOSA/agreement/etc. shall be listed under
        the title and centered at the top of each page.
        A1.2.3.2.3. The date of the tailored edition shall be on the cover page of the document.
        A1.2.3.2.4. The term "PROPRIETARY" shall be placed at the top and bottom of each page,
        centered directly over the title/heading (if requested by the Range User).
        A1.2.3.2.5. The following items from the front page (title page) of AFSPCMAN91-710 shall
        be removed:
            A1.2.3.2.5.1. "Docid" information (i.e. AFSPCMAN91-710VX).
            A1.2.3.2.5.2. "BY ORDER OF THE COMMANDER
                           AIR FORCE SPACE COMMAND"
            A1.2.3.2.5.3. Air Force Space Command Shield.
            A1.2.3.2.5.4. OPR and certifier information.
            A1.2.3.2.5.5. Number of pages and distribution information.
        A1.2.3.2.6. The remaining heading information shall be left justified.
        A1.2.3.2.7. Change "AIR FORCE SPACE COMMAND MANUAL 91-710 VOLUME X"
        TO "Extracted from AIR FORCE SPACE COMMAND MANUAL 91-710 VOLUME
        X".
88                                                              AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004


        A1.2.3.2.8. Change "COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY"
        TO "COMPLIANCE WITH THIS TAILORED EXTRACT OF AFSPCMAN91-710 IS
        MANDATORY".
        A1.2.3.2.9. In the introduction, the section identified as "NOTES:" shall read as follows:
        "NOTES:
         1. Volume 1 includes a complete table of contents for all the volumes of AFSPCMAN91-710.
        In addition, each individual volume contains its own table of contents. Volume 7 contains a
        glossary of references, acronyms, abbreviations, and terms for use with all volumes. Special
        publication formatting features are described in paragraph 8.2. of volume 1.
        2. Bordered paragraphs are non-mandatory and are used to identify some of the potential
        detailed technical solutions that meet the performance requirements of this document as well
        as applicable lessons learned."
        A1.2.3.2.10. All deleted information shall be removed from the tailored edition.
        A1.2.3.2.11. All added information shall be inserted in the tailored edition as a separate para-
        graph immediately following the most applicable paragraph in AFSPCMAN91-710. The
        added paragraph shall not be numbered. The add-in paragraphs shall be clearly labeled as,
        "(Program Name - Added)..............."
        A1.2.3.2.12. The signature block that appears on the last page of the official version of
        AFSPCMAN91-710, prior to the attachments, shall be removed from the tailored version.
     A1.2.3.3. Effectivity of AFSPCMAN 91-710 [T]:
        A1.2.3.3.1. Each AFSPCMAN 91-710 [T] shall contain a preface paragraph detailing its
        effectivity.
        A1.2.3.3.2. At a minimum, the types of vehicles, the time period, and the number of vehicles
        to which the AFSPCMAN 91-710 [T] applies shall be addressed.
     A1.2.3.4. Assumptions:
        A1.2.3.4.1. Each AFSPCMAN 91-710 [T] shall contain a preface paragraph detailing the crit-
        ical assumptions that were made in writing the tailored edition.
        A1.2.3.4.2. The nature of the assumptions shall be such that a change may invalidate the
        AFSPCMAN 91-710 [T] or require a change or update. An example of such a critical assump-
        tion is that the design of any hazardous system does not change from that presented before
        publication of the AFSPCMAN 91-710 [T].
        A1.2.3.4.3. The assumption(s) described in the Tailoring Request form shall include sufficient
        detail to categorize the scope of the tailored requirement to the specific systems or subsystems
        affected by the proposed change. If two or more systems/subsystems are affected by the tai-
        lored paragraph, then the assumption(s) shall state which of those systems/subsystems is
        intended to be included in the scope of the tailoring. If there is a difference in the tailoring for
        the two or more systems/subsystems, then the tailored paragraph shall be repeated with appro-
        priate tailoring unique to each individual system/subsystem.

                                             ATTACHMENT 2

                          SYSTEM SAFETY PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

A2.1. Introduction:
     A2.1.1. Purpose. This attachment establishes the minimum requirements for a Range User’s System
     Safety Program for range safety purposes. Such a program is consistent with MIL-STD-882, Depart-
     ment of Defense Standard Practice for System Safety, for DoD programs and the requirements of
     AFI 91-202 for Air Force programs. The program includes the corresponding requirements for a
     Range User System Safety Program Plan (SSPP) and identifies hazard analysis and risk assessment
     requirements.
     A2.1.2. Tailoring. Tailoring of this attachment and the requisite SSPP is highly recommended. The
     tailoring process is defined in Attachment 1 of this volume. When conflicting requirements or defi-
     ciencies are identified in range safety program requirements or with other program requirements, the
     Range User shall submit notification, with proposed solutions or alternatives and supporting rationale,
     to Range Safety for resolution.
     A2.1.3. Special Provisions. The ranges recognize that many programs may already have a system
     safety program due to contract or internal company directives. In these cases, many of the following
     tasks may already be covered and need only be provided to the ranges in the form of the larger system
     safety program. It is not the intent of the ranges for the requirements in this attachment to cause dupli-
     cate work. Additionally, the analyses and other requirements performed by the ranges in Volume 2,
     Flight Analyses and Volume 4, Airborne Flight Safety Systems are adequate for Range Safety pur-
     poses and no additional system safety analyses in these areas are required from the Range User by the
     ranges. However, the system safety management and organization in the System Safety Program Plan
     shall note that these analyses and other applicable requirements are performed by the ranges.
     A2.1.4. Demonstration of an Acceptable Level of Mishap Risk. Range Users shall demonstrate an
     acceptable level of mishap risk to Range Safety through the completion of the system safety hazard
     analyses and risk assessments described in this attachment.

A2.2. System Safety Program Tasks. To achieve the system safety objectives and obtain Range Safety
approval, the following tasks shall be completed by the Range User in the approximate order that they are
listed and in conjunction with the milestones that are identified.
     A2.2.1. Task 1: Establish a Range User Safety Program. By the time of the Range User’s program
     introduction, the Range User shall have established a Safety Program that meets the tailored require-
     ments of this publication which includes the following:
        A2.2.1.1. Establishing a safety management system. A Range User program manager shall be
        responsible for the following:
            A2.2.1.1.1. Establishing, controlling, incorporating, directing, and implementing the system
            safety program policies.
            A2.2.1.1.2. Ensuring that mishap risk is identified and eliminated or controlled within estab-
            lished program risk acceptability parameters. Decisions regarding resolution of identified haz-
            ards shall be based on assessment of the risk involved. To aid the achievement of the
            objectives of system safety, hazards shall be characterized as to hazard severity categories and
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004                                                                           91


        hazard probability levels, when possible. Since the priority for system safety is eliminating
        hazards by design, a risk assessment procedure, considering only hazard severity, will gener-
        ally suffice during the early design phase to minimize risk. When hazards are not eliminated
        during the early design phase, a risk assessment procedure based upon the hazard probability,
        hazard severity, as well as risk impact, shall be used to establish priorities for corrective action
        and resolution of identified hazards.
        A2.2.1.1.3. Establishing internal reporting systems and procedures for investigation and dis-
        position of system related mishaps and safety incidents, including potentially hazardous con-
        ditions not yet involved in a mishap or incident and reporting such matters to Range Safety.
        A2.2.1.1.4. Reviewing and approving the safety analyses, reports, and documentation
        required by this publication and submitted to Range Safety to establish knowledge and accep-
        tance of residual risks.
     A2.2.1.2. Establishing a key system safety position for each program. The individual in this posi-
     tion shall be directly responsible to the Range User program manager for safety matters. At a min-
     imum, Range User key safety personnel shall be responsible for the following:
        A2.2.1.2.1. Reviewing and approving all safety analyses, reports, and documentation required

        A2.2.1.9.1. Designing for Minimum Risk. From program inception, design to eliminate haz-
        ards. If an identified hazard cannot be eliminated, reduce the associated risk to an acceptable
        level, as defined by Range Safety, through design selection.
        A2.2.1.9.2. Incorporating Safety Devices. If identified hazards cannot be eliminated or their
        associated risk adequately reduced through design selection, that risk shall be reduced to a
        level acceptable to Range Safety through the use of fixed, automatic, or other protective safety
        design features or devices. Provisions shall be made for periodic functional checks of safety
        devices when applicable.
        A2.2.1.9.3. Providing Warning Devices. When neither design nor safety devices can effec-
        tively eliminate identified hazards or adequately reduce associated risk, devices shall be used
        to detect the condition and to produce an adequate warning signal to alert personnel of the haz-
        ard. Warning signals and their application shall be designed to minimize the probability of
        incorrect personnel reaction to the signals and shall be standardized within like types of sys-
        tems.
        A2.2.1.9.4. Developing Procedures and Training. Where it is impractical to eliminate hazards
        through design selection or adequately reduce the associated risk with safety and warning
        devices, procedures and training shall be used. However, without a specific waiver from
        Range Safety, no warning, caution, or other form of written advisory shall be used as the only
        risk reduction method for Category I or II hazards (per Volume 1, Table 3.1). Procedures may
        include the use of personal protective equipment. Precautionary notations shall be standard-
        ized as specified by Range Safety. Tasks and activities judged to be safety critical by Range
        Safety require certification of personnel proficiency.

        system hazard analysis (SSHA) to identify all components and equipment that could result in a
        hazard or whose design does not satisfy Range Safety requirements. The purpose of the SSHA is
        to verify subsystem compliance with safety requirements contained in subsystem specifications
        and other applicable documents; identify previously unidentified hazards associated with the
        design of subsystems including component failure modes, critical human error inputs, and hazards

        outputs, during the conduct of this analysis. The SSHA may indicate the need for revised tailoring
        of some requirements of this publication depending on the level of risk identified or the discovery
        of any previously unidentified hazards. The analysis shall include a determination of the follow-
        ing:
           A2.2.4.1.1. The modes of failure including reasonable human errors as well as single point
           and common mode failures, and the effects on safety when failures occur in subsystem compo-

        Range User recommends that a different technique than that specified by Range Safety should
        be used, the Range User shall obtain approval of techniques to be used before performing the
        analysis. The SHA may be combined with and/or performed using similar techniques to those
        used for the SSHA.

            shall be reported to Range Safety in time to support the ongoing phase of the software
            development process.
        A2.2.4.2.11. Updating the SHA. The Range User shall update the SHA as a result of any sys-
        tem design changes, including software design changes that affect system safety.
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004                                                                          99


        A2.2.4.2.12. SHA Submittal. A draft SHA shall be submitted before the CDR and the final
        shall be provided with the final MSPSP (See Attachment 1 of Volume 3).
     A2.2.4.3. Operating and Support Hazard Analyses. The Range User shall perform and docu-
     ment an operating and support hazard analysis (O&SHA) to examine procedurally controlled
     activities. The purpose of the O&SHA is to evaluate activities for hazards or risks introduced into
     the system by operational and support procedures and to evaluate adequacy of operational and
     support procedures used to eliminate, control, or abate identified hazards or risks. The O&SHA
     identifies and evaluates hazards resulting from the implementation of operations or tasks per-
     formed by persons, considering the following criteria: the planned system configuration and/or
     state at each phase of activity; the facility interfaces; the planned environments or the ranges
     thereof; the supporting tools or other equipment, including software controlled automatic test
     equipment, specified for use; operational and/or task sequence, concurrent task effects and limita-
     tions; biotechnological factors, regulatory or contractually specified personnel safety and health
     requirements; and the potential for unplanned events including hazards introduced by human
     errors. The human shall be considered an element of the total system, receiving both inputs and
     initiating outputs during the conduct of this analysis. The O&SHA shall identify the safety
     requirements or alternatives needed to eliminate or control identified hazards or to reduce the
     associated risk to a level that is acceptable under either regulatory or Range Safety specified crite-
     ria. The O&SHA may indicate the need for revised tailoring of some requirements of this publica-
     tion depending on the level of risk identified or the discovery of any previously unidentified
     hazards. The analysis shall identify the following:
        A2.2.4.3.1. Activities that occur under hazardous conditions, their time periods, and the
        actions required to minimize risk during these activities and time periods
        A2.2.4.3.2. Changes needed in functional or design requirements for system hardware and
        software, facilities, tooling, or support and test equipment to eliminate or control hazards or
        reduce associated risks
        A2.2.4.3.3. Requirements for safety devices and equipment, including personnel safety and
        life support equipment.
        A2.2.4.3.4. Warnings, cautions, and special emergency procedures such as egress, rescue,
        escape, render safe, explosive ordnance disposal, and backout, including those necessitated by
        failure of a computer software-controlled operation to produce the expected and required safe
        result or indication.
        A2.2.4.3.5. Requirements for packaging, handling, storage, transportation, maintenance, and
        disposal of hazardous materials.
        A2.2.4.3.6. Requirements for safety training and personnel certification.
        A2.2.4.3.7. Effects of non-developmental hardware and software across the interface with
        other system components or subsystems.
        A2.2.4.3.8. Potentially hazardous system states under operator control.
        A2.2.4.3.9. Assessment of Procedures. The O&SHA shall document system safety assess-
        ment of procedures involved in system production, deployment, installation, assembly, test,
        operation, maintenance, servicing, transportation, storage, modification, demilitarization, and
        disposal.

             A2.2.4.3.10. O&SHA Analysis Techniques. If no specific analysis techniques are directed or
             if the Range User recommends that a different technique other than that specified by Range
             Safety should be used, the Range User shall obtain approval of techniques to be used before
             performing the analysis.
             A2.2.4.3.11. Updating the O&SHA. The Range User shall update the O&SHA as a result of
             any system design or operational changes.
             A2.2.4.3.12. O&SHA Submittal. A draft O&SHA shall be submitted at least 90 days before
             the start of any hazardous operations and the final shall be provided with the final Ground
             Operations Plan (See Attachment 1 of Volume 6).
         A2.2.4.4. Facility Safety Analyses. The PHA, SSHA, SHA, and O&SHA shall address hazards
         associated with the facilities used to support the Range User program. The facility portions of
         these analyses shall be provided with the Facility Safety Data Package specified in Attachment 1
         of Volume 5.
      A2.2.5. Task 5: Perform and Document a Safety Assessment Report. The Range User shall per-
      form and document a SAR. The purpose of this task is to perform and document a comprehensive
      evaluation of the mishap risk being assumed before test or operation of the Range User’s system. The
      SAR shall be developed using data from the hazard analyses required in Task 4 (A2.2.4) and data
      packages required in Volumes 1 through 6 of this publication, and shall summarize the following
      information:
         A2.2.5.1. The safety criteria and methodology used to classify and rank hazards, plus any
         assumptions on which the criteria or methodologies were based or derived including the definition
         of acceptable risk as specified by Range Safety.
         A2.2.5.2. The results of analyses performed to identify hazards inherent in the system, including
         those hazards that still have a residual risk and the actions that have been taken to reduce the asso-
         ciated risk to a level specified as acceptable by Range Safety. (See Table 3.1 and Figure 3.1 of this
         volume.)
         A2.2.5.3. The results of the safety program efforts, including a list of all significant hazards along
         with specific safety recommendations or precautions required to ensure safety of personnel, prop-
         erty, or the environment. The list shall be categorized as to whether or not the risks may be
         expected under normal or abnormal operating conditions.
         A2.2.5.4. Conclusion with the Range User program safety manager and the Range User program
         manager signed statement that all identified hazards have been eliminated or their associated risks
         controlled to levels specified in Table 3.1 and Figure 3.1 of this volume, and that the system is
         ready to test or operate or proceed to the next acquisition phase.
         A2.2.5.5. Recommendations applicable to hazards at the interface of Range User systems with
         other systems, as required.
         A2.2.5.6. A formal request for Range Safety approval to conduct operations at the ranges.

                                         ATTACHMENT 3

             SUBMITTING AFSPCMAN 91-710 NONCOMPLIANCE REQUESTS

A3.1. Introduction:
   A3.1.1. Purpose. Equivalent levels of safety (ELS) and waivers are used when Range Users cannot
   meet the requirements of this publication.
   A3.1.2. Content. This attachment describes the noncompliance categories and the process for sub-
   mitting ELSs and waivers.
   A3.1.3. Applicability:
      A3.1.3.1. The noncompliance process is applicable to all programs including boosters, solid
      rocket motors, upper stages, payloads, ground support equipment, facilities, and others that oper-
      ate at the ranges or elsewhere if governed under Range Safety unless grandfathered in accordance
      with the criteria stated below.
      A3.1.3.2. The noncompliance process is also applicable to all programs regardless of which ver-
      sion of the old Range Safety Standards (such as AFETR 127-1, ESMCR 127-1, ERR 127-1,
      WSMCR 127-1, WRR 127-1, and EWR 127-1) is under contract.
      A3.1.3.3. The flight plan approval process does not fall within the intent of this attachment except
      when it involves launch vehicle and/or payload hardware.
   A3.1.4. Grandfathering Criteria. Previously approved systems with or without granted ELSs and
   waivers will be grandfathered and maintain approval and need not be resubmitted unless it is deter-
   mined by the Chief of Safety and/or the Range User that one of the situations described below exists.
   Range Safety shall coordinate all grandfathering determinations with the affected Range User.
      A3.1.4.1. Existing programs make major modifications that affect the launch vehicle’s operation
      or safety characteristics or include the use of currently approved components, systems, or sub-
      systems in a new application (through tailoring if desired). Exception: Previously approved exist-
      ing components, systems, or subsystems that do not increase the risks, do not degrade safety, or
      can survive new environments equivalent to or lower than the originally approved qualification
      levels shall be honored and do not have to meet new requirements as long as data and analyses
      show that the criteria have been met.
      A3.1.4.2. The Range User has determined that it is economically and technically feasible to
      incorporate new requirements into the system.
      A3.1.4.3. The system has been or will be modified to the extent that it is considered a new pro-
      gram or that existing safety approvals no longer apply. Risk and hazard analyses developed jointly
      by Range Safety and the Range User shall be used to determine applicability of the safety approv-
      als.
      A3.1.4.4. A previously unforeseen or newly discovered safety hazard exists that is deemed by
      either Range Safety or the Range User to be significant enough to warrant the change. This cate-
      gory includes systems that were previously approved, but when obtaining the approval, the non-
      compliances to the original requirement were not identified.
102                                                               AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004


         A3.1.4.5. A system or procedure is modified and a new requirement reveals that a significant risk
         exists.
         A3.1.4.6. Accident and incident investigations and reports may dictate compliance with the pub-
         lication.
      A3.1.5. Noncompliance Categories.
         A3.1.5.1. Public Safety. Public safety noncompliance deals with safety requirements involving
         risks to the public, including foreign countries, their personnel and/or their resources.
         A3.1.5.2. Launch Area Safety. Launch area safety noncompliances deal with safety require-
         ments involving risks that are limited to personnel and/or resources on AFSPC ranges, including
         CCAFS and VAFB and may be extended to KSC. Launch area safety involves multiple licensed
         users, government tenants, or USAF squadrons.
         A3.1.5.3. Launch Complex Safety. Launch complex safety noncompliances deal with safety
         requirements involving risk that is limited to the personnel and/or resources under the control of a
         single licensed user, full time government tenant organization, or USAF squadron/detachment
         (control authority). Launch complex safety is limited to risks confined to a physical space for
         which the single control authority is responsible.
      A3.1.6. Effectivity of Noncompliances:
         A3.1.6.1. Lifetime:
            A3.1.6.1.1. Lifetime waivers are undesirable and shall be limited to those situations where it
            is virtually impossible to meet the requirement or meet the intent of the requirement.
            A3.1.6.1.2. Lifetime ELSs are allowed provided equivalent safety is maintained.
         A3.1.6.2. Time Limited:
            A3.1.6.2.1. Time limited waivers are set for a limited period of time or a limited number of
            launches. The time constraint is normally determined as a function of cost, impact on sched-
            ule, and the minimum time needed to satisfactorily modify or replace the noncompliant system
            or to modify the noncompliant operation.
            A3.1.6.2.2. ELSs may be time limited depending on the method by which equivalent safety is
            accomplished. If excessive procedural controls, personnel, material, or costs are required to
            maintain equivalent safety, the ELS should be time limited.
      A3.1.7. Conditions for Issuance of ELSs and Waivers:
         A3.1.7.1. Hazard Mitigation. All reasonable steps shall be taken to meet the intent of the publi-
         cation requirements and mitigate associated hazards to acceptable levels, including design and
         operational methods.
         A3.1.7.2. Get Well Plans. Range Users who have ELSs and waivers that are not granted for the
         life of a program shall provide a plan to meet the requirements in question by the time the
         approved effectivity expires. Range Users who have ELSs and waivers that are granted for the life
         of the program shall provide Range Safety a definition of “program life” intended for the scope of
         the ELSs and waivers.
      A3.1.8. Risk-Cost Benefit Analysis:
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004                                                                          103


      A3.1.8.1. Technical disagreements regarding such items as applicable requirements, policy, crite-
      ria, or data may be evaluated on a risk-cost benefit basis to determine if the risk is acceptable to
      issue an ELS determination or waive the requirement.
      A3.1.8.2. Risk-cost benefit analyses based on the criteria defined in Table 3.1 of this volume shall
      be submitted to Range Safety.
      A3.1.8.3. Based on data from the risk-cost benefit analysis, Range Safety and the Range User
      shall reach agreement on the disposition of the requirements involving the launch area, launch
      complex personnel, and AF resources. However, Range Safety shall be the sole authority for the
      determination and disposition of requirements that affect public safety.
      A3.1.8.4. If the application of an AFSPCMAN 91-710 requirement results in a significant reduc-
      tion of risk at a significant cost benefit, it may be judged by Range Safety to be sufficient to
      impose the requirement; however, if the benefit is insignificant and/or the cost is high, the require-
      ment may be waived or determined to be an ELS, after considering the effect on public safety.

A3.2. Submitting Noncompliances:
   A3.2.1. Format. Range Users shall submit noncompliances in writing using any format that contains
   the same information as the Noncompliance Request form, if mutually agreed to by the Range User
   and Range Safety. An example format can be found in the Eastern and Western Range 127-1, Range
   Safety Requirements, Range User Handbook.
   A3.2.2. Content. The following items shall be included in the letter or memorandum:
      A3.2.2.1. Title: ELS or Waiver of (requirement a) for (requirement b).
      A3.2.2.2. Descriptive Title of ELS or Waiver request.
      A3.2.2.3. ELS or Waiver category.
      A3.2.2.4. ELS or Waiver effectivity.
      A3.2.2.5. Background.
          A3.2.2.5.1. Summary of Range Safety requirement.
          A3.2.2.5.2. Statement of the noncompliance.
          A3.2.2.5.3. Reason for request.
      A3.2.2.6. Conditions for ELS or Waiver.
          A3.2.2.6.1. Hazard mitigation.
          A3.2.2.6.2. Get Well Plan.
   A3.2.3. Process:
      A3.2.3.1. Requests for ELSs and waivers shall be submitted to the office of the Chief of Safety as
      early as they are known to be necessary.
      A3.2.3.2. Public safety ELSs and waivers such as those including flight plan approval, FTS
      design, and toxic propellant storage normally require extensive risk analyses that can take one to
      two years to perform; therefore, these ELSs and waivers shall be initiated during the planning
      phase and be closed out by Range Safety (ELSs) or the Space Wing Commander (waivers)
104                                                              AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004


         approval or design change before manufacture of the booster, spacecraft, FTS, or other system in
         question.
         A3.2.3.3. Launch area safety and launch complex safety ELSs and waivers normally require two
         weeks to two months to process depending on the nature of the noncompliance and the requested
         effectivity.
         A3.2.3.4. The Space Wing shall coordinate all noncompliance requests with affected agencies, as
         appropriate. A coordinated review and resolution of requests for relief from common AF-FAA
         launch safety requirements shall be per procedures developed between the AFSPC and the FAA.
         The Space Wing shall also coordinate all noncompliance requests with the affected Range User.
      A3.2.4. Approvals:
         A3.2.4.1. Programs launching from only the ER or WR require only the appropriate 30 SW/SE or
         45 SW/SE approvals.
         A3.2.4.2. Programs launching from both ranges require approvals from 30 SW/SE and 45 SW/
         SE.
         A3.2.4.3. Waivers dealing with public safety shall be approved by the SW Commanders.
         A3.2.4.4. Waivers other than public safety shall be approved by the Chiefs of Safety or their des-
         ignated representatives.
         A3.2.4.5. ELSs shall be approved by appropriate 45 SW/SE or 30 SW/SE Chiefs of Safety or
         their designated representatives.

                                           ATTACHMENT 4

                                  ACCEPTABLE RISK CRITERIA

A4.1. Introduction. The risk criteria defined in this attachment apply to all programs and missions oper-
ating at the ranges.

A4.2. Definition of Terms and Guidance Information:
   A4.2.1. Casualty:
       A4.2.1.1. Definition. A casualty is a serious injury or worse, including death, to a human.
       A4.2.1.2. Guidance Information. Casualty modeling is a critical part of any risk analysis per-
       formed before flight to establish launch commit criteria that protect against casualties. Abbrevi-
       ated Injury Scale (AIS) Level 3 and greater is appropriate for describing a medical condition
       sufficiently to allow modeling of casualties for purposes of determining whether a launch satisfies
       the risk criteria for launch-essential personnel and the public. The AIS is an anatomical scoring
       system first introduced in 1969. AIS provides a reasonably accurate way of ranking the severity of
       an injury. A scaling committee of the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine
       monitors the AIS. In the AIS system, injuries are ranked on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 being a minor
       injury; 2, moderate; 3, serious; 4, severe; 5, critical; and 6, a non-survivable injury.
   A4.2.2. Risk:
       A4.2.2.1. Definition. Risk is a measure that accounts for both the probability of occurrence and
       the consequence of a hazard to a population or installation. Unless otherwise noted, risk is mea-
       sured in casualties and expressed as individual risk or collective risk.
       A4.2.2.2. Individual Risk:
           A4.2.2.2.1. Definition. Individual risk is the risk that any single person will suffer a conse-
           quence. Unless otherwise noted, individual risk is expressed as the probability that any indi-
           vidual will become a casualty from a given hazard (Ec) at a specific location and event.
           A4.2.2.2.2. Guidance Information. If each person in a group is subject to the same individual
           risk, then the collective risk may be computed as the individual risk multiplied by the number
           of people in the group.
       A4.2.2.3. Collective Risk:
           A4.2.2.3.1. Definition. Collective risk is the combined risk to all individuals exposed to a par-
           ticular hazard during a specific period of time or event such as a specific phase of flight,
           launch area, downrange (overflight). Unless otherwise noted, collective risk is the mean num-
           ber of casualties predicted (Ec) to result from a given hazard.
           A4.2.2.3.2. Guidance Information. For launch, the collective risk per hazard may be deter-
           mined for each of the different phases of flight, such as the launch area or downrange/over-
           flight, or accumulated through all phases of the vehicle’s flight.
106                                                              AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004


      A4.2.2.4. Accumulated Risk:
         A4.2.2.4.1. Definition. Accumulated risk is the combined collective risk to all individuals
         exposed to a particular hazard through all phases of an operation.
         A4.2.2.4.2. Guidance Information. For the flight of an orbital launch vehicle, risk is accumu-
         lated from liftoff through orbital insertion. For the flight of a suborbital launch vehicle, risk is
         accumulated from liftoff through the impact of all pieces of the launch vehicle, including the
         payload.
      A4.2.2.5. Aggregated Risk:
         A4.2.2.5.1. Definition. Aggregated risk is the accumulated risk due to all hazards associated
         with a flight.
         A4.2.2.5.2. Guidance Information. For a specified launch, aggregated risk includes, but is not
         limited to, the risk due to debris impact, toxic release, and distant focusing of blast overpres-
         sure.
      A4.2.2.6. Launch-Essential Personnel:
         A4.2.2.6.1. Definition. Launch-essential personnel are those persons necessary to safely and
         successfully complete a specific hazardous operation or launch.
         A4.2.2.6.2. Guidance Information. Launch-essential personnel include supporting personnel
         required to perform emergency actions according to authorized directives and persons in train-
         ing. Range Safety and the Range User jointly determine the number of launch-essential per-
         sonnel allowed within safety clearance zones or hazardous launch areas, with concurrence of
         the Space Wing Commander.
      A4.2.2.7. Public:
         A4.2.2.7.1. Definition. Public refers to all persons not in the launch-essential category. There
         are two sub-categories of public: neighboring operations personnel and the general public.
         A4.2.2.7.2. Neighboring Operations Personnel:
             A4.2.2.7.2.1. Definition. Neighboring operations individuals are individuals, not associ-
             ated with the specific operation or launch currently being conducted, required to perform
             safety, security, or critical tasks at the launch base and who are notified of a neighboring
             hazardous operation and are either trained in mitigation techniques or accompanied by a
             properly trained escort.
             A4.2.2.7.2.2. Guidance Information. For a commercially licensed launch, the FAA, as
             well as the range, shall approve the number and location of all neighboring operations per-
             sonnel. Neighboring operations personnel may include individuals performing launch pro-
             cessing tasks for another launch, but do not include individuals in training for any job or
             individuals performing routine activities such as administrative, maintenance, support,
             janitorial. Neighboring operations personnel may be allowed within safety clearance zones
             and hazardous launch areas and would not be evacuated with the general public. Neighbor-
             ing operations personnel shall be included in the same risk category as launch-essential
             personnel. Range Safety and the Range User jointly determine the number and location of
             neighboring operations personnel, with the concurrence of the SW Commander. For a
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004                                                                          107


              commercially licensed launch, the FAA as well as the range must approve the numbers and
              locations of neighboring operations personnel.
          A4.2.2.7.3. General Public:
              A4.2.2.7.3.1. Definition. The general public consists of all individuals that are not in the
              launch-essential personnel or neighboring operations personnel categories.
              A4.2.2.7.3.2. Guidance Information. For a specific launch, the general public includes all
              visitors, media, and other non-essential personnel at the launch base, as well as persons
              located outside the boundaries of the launch site.
          A4.2.2.7.4. Probabilistic Modeling:
              A4.2.2.7.4.1. Definition. Probabilistic modeling is a process of employing statistical prin-
              ciples and the laws of probability to quantify the variability and the uncertainty in a physi-
              cal quantity. The results of probabilistic modeling typically express the ratio of the
              outcomes that would produce a given event to the total number of possible outcomes.
              A4.2.2.7.4.2. Guidance Information. Two common forms of probabilistic modeling are
              pure statistical modeling and probabilistic modeling with reference to a deterministic
              model. Statistical modeling refers to the process of using statistical analysis of data to
              characterize an outcome. Probabilistic modeling with reference to a deterministic model
              begins with an appropriate deterministic model describing the underlying physical pro-
              cess. Probabilistic models (probability distributions of input parameters and characteriza-
              tion of model uncertainty) are superimposed on the deterministic model to develop a
              characterization of the likelihood of different outcomes from the process being studied.
              Probabilistic modeling is used for many purposes including (1) characterizing perfor-
              mance envelopes of a booster, (2) characterizing the ability of a tracker to detect and track
              a booster, (3) characterizing the region hazarded by a particular peril; for example, impact
              probability contours, and (4) computing the risk from a hazardous operation; for example,
              casualty expectation from a mission.
          A4.2.2.7.5. Deterministic Modeling:
              A4.2.2.7.5.1. Definition. A deterministic model is a mathematical model used to evaluate
              the extent of a hazard. Deterministic models are the mathematical basis used to establish
              boundaries that define where a specific hazard exists.
              A4.2.2.7.5.2. Guidance Information. Deterministic models are commonly employed for
              the following purposes: (1) to establish a reference model about which to build a probabi-
              listic model, (2) when a Range Safety analyst believes that variability and uncertainty are
              not important in the context of the analysis, and (3) as the basis for conservative screening
              of models to assess whether one or more hazardous conditions poses a sufficient threat to
              warrant operational restrictions or more complete analyses.

A4.3. Description of Risk Criteria:
   A4.3.1. As shown in Table A4.1, comparing normally accepted public, day-to-day accident risk
   exposure to normal launch vehicle and payload launch operating risks indicates that, under any cir-
   cumstances, the annual collective risk for launch operations is small.
108                                                               AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004


      A4.3.2. Individual hazardous activities may exceed guidance levels based on national need or mis-
      sion requirements. ELSs or waiver requests are required.
      A4.3.3. All programs and missions are subject to GO/NO-GO decisions based on risk acceptance.
      The overall risk levels resulting from debris, toxic, and blast overpressure shall not be aggregated.
      Risk guidance levels in 3.2 and 3.3 of this volume are derived from the criteria shown in Table A4.1.

 g If the risk is > 30 x 10-6 but < 300 x 10-6, a SW Commander waiver is required. If the risk is > 300
 x 10-6 but < 3000 x 10-6, in addition to the SW Commander waiver, the 14 AF/CC shall be advised of
 the risk. If the risk is > 3,000 x 10-6, in addition to the SW Commander waiver and notifying the 14
 AF/CC, approval shall be obtained from the AFSPC/CC.
 h At most one such launch per year assumed for calculation purposes only. In practice, there is no such

 limit.
 iFrom Risk Commonality/Acceptability Workshop, August 1990. Based on an equivalent to an aver-
 age of one casualty per 1,000 years with launches at the rate of 33 per year.
 j   A casualty is a serious injury or worse, including death to a human.
      A4.3.4. The following risk acceptability criteria are provided as guidance for the SW Commanders
      and as planning information for Range Users.
      A4.3.5. The risk associated with the total flight to all members of the general public, excluding per-
      sons in waterborne vessels and aircraft, shall not exceed an expected average number of 0.00003 casu-
      alties (Ec < 30 x 10-6) from impacting inert and explosive debris, Ec < 30 x 10-6 for toxic release
      (exposure to rocket propellant effluent), and Ec < 30 x 10-6 for far field blast overpressure. The Ec cri-
      terion for each hazard applies to each launch from liftoff through orbital insertion, including planned
      impact for an orbital launch, and through final impact for a suborbital launch. Range Safety shall
      determine the public risk due to other hazards associated with the proposed flight of a launch vehicle
      on a case-by-case basis.
      A4.3.6. The risk to an individual member of the public shall not exceed an Ec of 0.000001 per launch
      (Ec < 1 x 10-6).
      A4.3.7. The probability of debris impact to all waterborne vessels (Piv) shall not exceed 0.00001 (Piv
      < x 10-5) in each debris impact hazard area identified by Range Safety.

A4.4. Risk Assessment Approach and Policy:
      A4.4.1. The overall risk assessment approach at AFSPC launch ranges is to accumulate the risks
      (both in the launch area and down range/overflight) due to the various hazards (debris, blast, and tox-
      ics), but not to aggregate the risks. Refer to the definitions of terms for an explanation of accumulated
      and aggregated risks. Each hazard risk is treated separately.
      A4.4.2. Accumulated Risk Criteria Levels. Accumulated risk is the combined collective risk to all
      individuals exposed to a particular hazard through all phases of an operation/flight. For the flight of an
      orbital launch vehicle, risk is accumulated from liftoff through orbital insertion. For the flight of a
      suborbital launch vehicle, risk is accumulated from liftoff through the impact of all pieces of the
      launch vehicle, including any payload. The various levels of hazard risks are described below.
          A4.4.2.1. Hazard Risks <10 in 1,000,000 (Ec <10 x 10-6). This level of risk is acceptable if sup-
          ported by established standardized risk analyses approved by Range Safety. Established standard-
          ized risk analysis refers to analysis that meets the requirements outlined in this publication. A
AFSPCMAN 91-710 V1 1 JULY 2004                                                                           111


      standardized risk analysis allows for a side-by-side comparison of programs. Range Safety is the
      approval authority for risks <10 in 1,000,000 (Ec <10 x 10-6).

      A4.4.2.2. Hazard Risks >10 through 30 in 1,000,000 (Ec >10 x 10-6 through 30 x 10-6). This level
      of risk may require the Range User to take additional measures to protect personnel and resources.
      Examples include fix/correct/improve existing noncompliances, improve risk analyses to reduce
      the level of uncertainty, require a day-of-launch risk analysis, establish disaster aversion criteria.
      Range Safety is the approval authority for risks >10 through 30 in 1,000,000 (Ec >10 x 10-6
      through 30 x 10-6).
      A4.4.2.3. Hazard Risks >30 through 300 in 1,000,000 (Ec >30 x 10-6 through 300 x 10-6). This
      level of risk may require the Range User to take additional measures to protect personnel and
      resources. Examples include fix/correct/improve existing noncompliances, improve risk analyses
      to reduce the level of uncertainty, require a day-of-launch risk analysis, establish disaster aversion
      criteria. The SW Commanders, based on their assessment of national need, may approve launches
      with risks >30 through 300 in 1,000,000 (Ec >30 x 10-6 through 300 x 10-6). FAA-licensed
      launches with risks greater than 30 in 1,000,00 (Ec >30 x 10-6) require a waiver from both the SW
      Commander and the FAA.
      A4.4.2.4. Hazard Risks >300 in 1,000,000 (Ec >300 x 10-6). This level of risk may require the
      Range User to take additional measures to protect personnel and resources. Examples include fix/
      correct/improve existing noncompliances, improve risk analyses to reduce the level of uncertainty,
      require a day-of-launch risk analysis, establish disaster aversion criteria.. The SW Commanders,
      based on their assessment of national need, may approve launches with risks greater than 300 in
      1,000,000 (Ec >300 x 10-6). However, the SW Commander shall advise the 14 AF/CC before
      allowing launches that exceed an Ec of 300 x 10-6. FAA-licensed launches with risks greater than
      300 in 1,000,00 (Ec >300 x 10-6) require a waiver from both the SW Commander and the FAA.
   A4.4.3. Acceptable Accumulated Risk Level Criteria for Each Hazard:
      A4.4.3.1. Debris, 30 in 1,000,000 (Ec = 30 x 10-6).

      A4.4.3.2. Blast, 30 in 1,000,000 (Ec = 30 x 10-6).

      A4.4.3.3. Toxics, 30 in 1,000,000 (Ec = 30 x 10-6).

A4.5. Risk Analysis:
   A4.5.1. AIS level 3 shall be used to quantify casualties in risk analysis models.
   A4.5.2. Risk analysis can be conducted using a two-tiered approach. The tiering approach allows
   Range Users to initially employ relatively simple metrics to establish a casualty from each hazard
   (debris, blast overpressure, and toxics). If the range determines that the result of the first tier (rela-
   tively simplistic and moderately conservative) risk analysis demonstrates adequate safety, no further
   analysis is required. However, if the tier 1 analysis were determined by Range Safety to be too risky,
   Range Users shall perform a tier 2 (sophisticated) risk analysis. The tier 1 thresholds reflect 1 percent
   probability of effect.

      A4.5.2.1. Hazard Parameters:
         A4.5.2.1.1. Debris:
            A4.5.2.1.1.1. Two screens shall be used for a tier 1 debris risk analysis. The first screen is
            11 foot-pounds for a casualty due to blunt trauma for the general public (in the open) due
            to a typical launch vehicle debris impact for both the launch area and down range/over-
            flight. The second screen shall account for a casualty due to a penetrating injury for the
            general public (in the open) due to a typical launch vehicle debris impact for both the
            launch area and down range/overflight. The second screen shall be based on a penetration
            injury threshold level of 8 foot-pounds per inch squared that will be defined by Range
            Safety during tailoring discussions.
         A4.5.2.1.2. Blast Overpressure:
            A4.5.2.1.2.1. Two criteria shall be used for a tier 1 blast overpressure risk analysis. The
            first criterion is 1 psi for a casualty due to a blast load following a launch vehicle accident
            for both the launch area and down range/overflight. The second criterion is fragment throw
            distance for ships and boats. Range Users shall calculate a fragment throw distance for
            ships and boats using 1.0 psi for ships and 1/2 psi for boats.

              GENERIC PAYLOAD POLICY AND APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS

A6.1. Generic Payloads. Many payload systems are generic, meaning they are built on identical bus
structures, they launch on a standard launch vehicle, and use standard range processing prelaunch and
launch procedures. If requested by a Range User and upon completion of the initial payload bus/launch
vehicle processing/launch cycle, a Range Safety approved baseline shall be established identifying the
program as a generic payload program. These generic payload systems result in few changes to the base-
line system, and the payload/launch vehicle ground processing safety data remains basically the same
from one mission to the next. The interactive process between Range Safety, payload (bus) manufactur-
ers, and launch vehicle companies or government agencies (Range Users) described in this attachment has
been developed to reduce the cost and time required for the approval process while satisfying the required
Range Safety requirements.
   A6.1.1. Policy. To take advantage of previously approved generic payload/launch systems and their
   associated ground processing safety data, the policies described below shall be followed; however,
   they may be modified to meet individual program requirements:
       A6.1.1.1. Range Safety and the Range User shall conduct initial planning meetings to establish a
       generic payload/launch system approval process.
       A6.1.1.2. Once a baseline payload/launch system has been approved, Range Safety efforts will
       focus on specific changes for each new program or mission. Existing and ongoing previously
       approved components, systems, and subsystems need not be resubmitted as part of data packages
       for review and approval.
       A6.1.1.3. Range Safety and the Range User shall conduct a safety assessment of each new pro-
       gram or mission to define changes and/or additions that create new uncontrolled hazards or that
       increase risks significantly.
           A6.1.1.3.1. Based on the joint safety assessment, the parties shall agree on the minimum
           required changes and/or documentation to be submitted to Range Safety for review and
           approval.
           A6.1.1.3.2. Data submittal and Range Safety response times shall be established based on the
           joint safety assessment and modified only upon agreement of all parties.
       A6.1.1.4. The goal of the generic payload approval process is to achieve final Range Safety
       approval at least 60 calendar days before payload arrival on the launch complex.

A6.2. Approval Process for Existing Payload Buses. For existing payload buses with approved base-
line Missile System Prelaunch Safety Packages (MSPSPs), Accident Risk Assessment Reports (ARARs),
SARs, GOPs, and hazardous and safety critical procedures, the goal is to grant baseline approvals for
generic buses during the first mission, after a request for generic status by a Range User and upon imple-
mentation of this approach. Subsequent flights would use the joint assessment process to review and
approve changes to the generic bus and/or payload additions for specific missions. Key to the approach is
the safety assessment that is used to determine whether changes or additions have created any new uncon-
trolled hazards or increased the risks significantly. The assessment results will be used to determine

            A6.2.1.1.2. Changes to the payload bus.
            A6.2.1.1.3. Planned payload additions for the mission.
            A6.2.1.1.4. Changes to hazardous systems and operations (the focus of this review).
         A6.2.1.2. Range Safety concurrence for both the mission concept and schedule for the remaining
         Range Safety milestones shall be provided during the mission orientation safety briefing or within
         14 calendar days after the briefing.
      A6.2.2. Data Review and Approval:
         A6.2.2.1. Mission Unique Missile System Prelaunch Safety Package:
            A6.2.2.1.1. An MSPSP, ARAR, or SAR shall be delivered approximately 12 months before
            launch and contain the data requirements identified during the mission orientation safety brief-
            ing on the changes to the launch vehicle and payload unique for the mission and identified in
            the initial operation’s concept review.

           A6.2.2.1.2. Range Safety shall provide responses 45 calendar days after receipt of the data
           package.
       A6.2.2.2. Ground Operations Plan and Hazardous and Safety Critical Procedures:
           A6.2.2.2.1. A GOP supplement describing changes to approved operations and/or new or
           modified safety critical or hazardous procedures shall be delivered to Range Safety approxi-
           mately 120 days before payload arrival on the range. This supplement is required only if
           changes have been made to operations and procedures that affect hazardous levels or risks.
           A6.2.2.2.2. Range Safety shall provide responses 45 calendar days after receipt of the data.
   A6.2.3. Mission Approval Safety Review:
       A6.2.3.1. A mission approval safety review shall be conducted approximately L - 120 days to
       obtain Range Safety approval for launch vehicle and payload processing, transport to the payload
       launch pad, payload launch vehicle mating, and launch pad payload processing.
       A6.2.3.2. Unless there are significant issues, Range Safety shall provide mission safety approval
       14 calendar days after the safety review.
   A6.2.4. Final Launch Approval. Final approval to proceed with launch vehicle and payload pro-
   cessing up to beginning the final countdown shall be provided by Range Safety at least 60 days before
   payload arrival at the launch complex. Flight plan approval for a mission that involves public safety
   may not be granted until just before the Launch Readiness Review (LRR) depending on the complex-
   ity of the public safety issue encountered. For example, typically, at the ER, easterly launch azimuths
   can be approved at least 120 days before launch; on the other hand, high inclination launches may
   require extensive risk analyses that can delay final flight plan approval until just before the LRR.

A6.3. Approval Process for New Payload Buses. For new payload buses, the Range User shall submit
a request for generic status at program introduction. The Range User shall then comply with the tailored
requirements of this publication for the program. Range Safety shall evaluate the initial mission process-
ing and associated data and grant baseline approval as a generic bus. Subsequent flights would follow the
requirements set out in A6.2 for existing payloads.

A6.4. Incidental Range Safety Issues. Incidental Range Safety issues such as component failures, test
failures, and the discovery of unforeseen hazards occurring after baseline approvals shall be worked in
real time as part of the final approval process for an individual launch requirements. ELS or waiver
requests are required.
