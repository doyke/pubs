     Commitments (ADSC), and course listing in ETCA for more information.
     1.4.5.3. OG/CC may develop additional training requirements and/or programs as
     necessary to meet unit mission requirements. Units may include such requirements in a
     local supplement to this AFI.
     1.4.5.4. The operations group, in coordination with the flying squadrons and presidential
     unit, will determine the functions and responsibilities of the operations support squadron
     (OSS) training flight, where established. Any operations group training functions
     stipulated in this instruction may also be performed by appropriate OSS training flight
     personnel.
     1.4.5.5. OG/CC is responsible for establishing and maintaining the academic training
     program for non-ATS courses (may be delegated to squadron level). The OG (or
     squadron) OPR will:
        1.4.5.5.1. Appoint primary and alternate instructors for each non-ATS course to be
        taught.
        1.4.5.5.2. Publish a ground training schedule (ANG/AFRC, as required) to include

   1.5.1. Do not deviate from the policies and requirements in this AFI. Report deviations or
   exceptions through channels to MAJCOM aircrew training function who, in turn, should
   notify the OPR (lead command), for follow-on action.
   1.5.2. Unless otherwise directed, waiver authority for contents of this instruction is the
   MAJCOM/A3/DO with mission execution authority for aircrew training requirements that
   are not governed by AFI 11-202, Volume 1. OG/CCs (or equivalents) are designated as the
   waiver authority for semi-annual requirements mandated in Chapter 4 of this AFI. Waivers
   for training or currency events missed in consecutive periods will require MAJCOM
   approval.
   1.5.3. The OG/CC is designated waiver authority for minimum flying hour and time
   requirements for entry into formal upgrade courses (see Table 5.1.). NOTE: The 201
   AS/CC will submit waiver requests to this volume through NGB/A3O. HQ AFRC/A3T,
   NGB/A3O will send information copies to AMC/A3TA. A copy of the MAJCOM approved
   waiver will be placed in the individual’s training folder and a squadron training waiver log.

1.6. Use of Training Flying Hours.
   1.6.1. Structure unit flying training missions to achieve optimum training. Any by-product
   airlift opportunity resulting from training must not degrade the intended training and will
   comply with applicable Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 4515.13-R, Air
   Transportation Eligibility, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management and AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010                                                                          13


        1.6.1.1. It is essential that all personnel at all levels prevent the misuse of air mobility
        resources as well as the perception of their misuse when planning and executing local or
        off-station training missions.
        1.6.1.2. The approval authority for an off-station training flight is the WG/CC and may
        not be delegated lower than OG/CC. Coordinate with appropriate scheduling agency
        (HQ USAF/Assistant Vice Chief of Staff/Special Air Missions (CVAM), ANG, Tanker
        Airlift Control Center (TACC), Joint Operational Support Airlift Center (JOSAC), Air
        Mobility Operations Control Centers (AMOCC), or theater equivalent whichever is
        appropriate. Forward a copy of the planned itinerary to the appropriate agency (18
        AF/CCE or MAJCOM/DOT/A3T). NOTE: The approval authority for 201 AS off-
        station OCONUS training flights is 113 WG/CC. The approval authority for CONUS
        training flights is 201 AS/CC.
   1.6.2. Training on Operational Missions. Aircraft Commander will depart home station with
   a list of required currency events. All crew members will take full advantage of
   opportunities to accomplish required currency events on operational missions. Unless
   specifically prohibited or restricted by MDS operating procedures or specific theater
   operations order (OPORD), upgrade, qualification or special qualification training may be
   accomplished on operational missions. Commanders will ensure the training will not impact
   mission effectiveness and the crewmember receiving training is under the supervision of an
   instructor of like specialty. See passenger-carrying restrictions in AFI 11-401. NOTE:
   Unqualified pilots are not allowed access to the controls with passengers on board the
   aircraft.
1.7. In-Unit Training Time Limitations. Comply with the time limitations in Table 1.2

NOTES:
1. If required, CSO mission qualification training will begin after completion of all Information
Technology course requirements. Mission qualification for VC-25 is 360 days.
2. May run concurrently with mission qualification training.

   1.7.1. Training time starts with the first significant training event (a training event directly
   contributing to qualification and upgrade: e.g. Computer-based training (CBT) lesson,
   ground training, flight, etc.), or 45 days (90 days ANG/AFRC) after being attached or
   assigned to the unit after completion of the formal school, whichever occurs first (or as
   specified in MAJCOM supplement). Training time ends with the syllabus completion.
   1.7.2. Unit/CC may extend training time up to 60 days (120 days ANG/AFRC). No
   notification to MAJCOM/A3T is required. Extensions exceeding 60 days require
   MAJCOM/DOT/A3T approval (120 days for ANG/AFRC units). Units will notify the
   appropriate MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) in writing or via AMC/A3T web site before the
   crewmember exceeds upgrade training time limits.
       1.7.2.1. Use the waiver request format shown in Figure 1.1 Include training difficulty,
       unit corrective action to resolve and prevent recurrence, and estimated completion date.
1.8. Training Documentation. Units will use the AF IMT 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew
Qualification Worksheet as prescribed by AFI 333311-202, Volume 1, to update aircrew
certifications in ARMS. See Chapter 7 for specific ―Q‖ codes. See Attachment 2 for
additional training documentation requirements.
1.9. Flight Examiner Usage. Use flight evaluators for any phase of training to capitalize on
their expertise and experience. If an evaluator is used as a primary instructor to train an
individual or makes the recommendation for evaluation, the same evaluator should not
administer the associated evaluation.
1.10. Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements.
   1.10.1. All instructors should be MR (wing-level and below).
   1.10.2. When performing aircrew duties, the following personnel must be under the direct
   supervision of an instructor:
AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010                                                                        15


       1.10.2.1. All non-current crewmembers (see paragraph 4.2.5. for exceptions).
       1.10.2.2. All crewmembers in initial, upgrade (to include special mission qualification
       training) or requalification flying training. Upgrade students may fly without an instructor
       when performing duties not related to the upgrade, unless otherwise restricted in this
       paragraph.
       1.10.2.3. All crewmembers performing restricted flying events listed on the AF Form 8
       as prescribed by AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program
       Organization and Administration.
       1.10.2.4. For unqualified, non-current, and FTL E crewmembers, an instructor will be at
       a set of controls or providing supervision during critical phases of flight.
       1.10.2.5. Any other personnel designated by the wing, OG, or Sq/CC.
1.11. Distribution. Units will establish hard copy distribution requirements of this AFI.
1.12. Transfer of Aircrews. When a crewmember transfers from one unit to another, the
gaining unit will review, assess and assign the appropriate TL.
1.13. Aircrew Training While DNIF and Alert.
   1.13.1. Crewmembers whose status is "duty not involving flying (DNIF)" may complete
   ground training events, including simulator training, if the member's physical condition
   allows it. Consult the flight surgeon initiating AF Form 1042 action (prescribed by AFI 48-
   123, Medical Examinations and Standards) if the DNIF status includes ground training
   limitations.
   1.13.2. Crewmembers may complete ground training while on alert status if it does not
   interfere with rest cycles or alert responsiveness.
1.14. Aircrew Rated Management Overview.
   1.14.1. Program Requirements Document (PRD). According to AFI 11-412, Aircrew
   Management, USAF/A3O projects long-range training requirements annually in a process
   called the PRD. Lead and user commands contribute to the PRD, which becomes a key long-
   range planning tool for training requirements. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1 for guidance on
   the Graduate Program Requirements Document (GPRD) and aircrew rated management
   process.
   1.14.2. Programmed Flying Training (PFT).              AMC/A3TA, in coordination with
   AMC/A7KQ, balances commercial contractor training capacity and unit training
   requirements on an annual basis (FY or calendar year depending on the contract). Annually,
   units will send projected PFT requirements to their respective MAJCOM training staff.
       1.14.2.1. Throughout the training year, MAJCOM training staff, contract managers, and
       unit training managers, use funded training quotas to assign individual crewmembers into
       formal schools.
1.15. Information Management. HQ AMC Aircrew Training Division (A3T) manages as host
of     aircrew   information.   The    A3T    Division   CoP     is    located    at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-OP-AM-94.
 16                                                               AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010


1.16. Failure to Progress or Complete Training. If a student fails to progress according to
syllabus requirements, conduct a Progress Review (PR). The PR can recommend continuation in
training; or AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges,
action; (e.g., a Flying Evaluation Board (FEB) to the individual’s unit commander). The ATS
contractor will identify students who fail to progress IAW the applicable ATS contract as
outlined in Chapter 6. If a crewmember fails to complete a formal course the formal school will
send a recommendation to the individual’s unit. The recommendation will state whether he
should complete training in-unit, return to the formal school to complete training, or be referred
to the AF personnel system for reassignment.
1.17. Career Enlisted Aviators (CEA). CEA are not tied to AFMAN 36-2101, Enlisted
Classification, skill level upgrade. All enlisted aircrew qualifications are separate and distinct
from skill level qualification. When AF IMT 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, is
completed for the applicable flight evaluation, then that crewmember is qualified to perform all
duties assigned to that crew qualification regardless of skill level. Aircrew instructor
qualification and flight examiner certification are also separate and distinct from on-the-job
trainer (OJT) trainer or certifier designation and are reflected in AFSC by use of ―K‖ prefix
(aircrew instructor) and ―Q‖ prefix (aircrew flight examiner).
1.18. Aircrew Training Quota Management. The following information describes AMC’s
policy and procedures for quota management. This policy was developed from requirements in
AFI 36-2201, 36-2107, AFI 11-412, and is mandatory for all AMC units. For PACAF and
USAFE units please follow MAJCOM/A3T guidance.
   1.18.1. Programmed Flying Training (PFT). For VIPSAM crews, the annual PFT
   requirement is established by the Operations Group based on unit projections of training
   needs for the following training year.
       1.18.1.1. The OSS/OST (or equivalent) forwards projected PFT/contractor training
       requirements for the next training year to the appropriate MAJCOM Contracting Officer
       and AMC/A3TA training manager by 15 June. With advanced notice, commercial
       contractor training capacity is normally sufficient to meet all PFT requirements. Late
       requirements may require flexibility on training dates and training times.
   1.18.2. Unit training PFT responsibilities are as follows:
       1.18.2.1. Schedule students for contracted ground school, simulator training, and flight
       training through their flying unit. Units will contact the contractor’s scheduling office to
       schedule/confirm each training class. Normally provide the class start date to attendees
       no later than 30 days prior to class start. Unit training schedulers will comply with
       individual contract scheduling lead time requirements.
       1.18.2.2. When a scheduled training class cannot be filled, the Unit will notify their
       respective OSS training office so the class may be reallocated. If circumstances prevent
       an identified candidate from attending the training (e.g., DNIF, unable to complete
       prerequisite training, etc.), inform the ATS contractor and the MAJCOM contracting
       officer immediately. Every effort should be made to fill a vacated slot. Unit training
       schedulers will be familiar with contract lead time requirements for cancelling training
       without incurring a financial penalty. Cancelling training inside of the contract cutoff
       date may lead to the contractor billing the Government (unit training funds) for the class.
AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010                                                                          17


     1.18.2.3. No-shows and late cancellations (outside of individual contract cancellation
     policies) must be explained. Forward an initial report of circumstances to the MAJCOM
     contract manager, info AMC/A3TA within 24 hours of course start date.
  1.18.3. Issue applicable publications to attendees prior to start of training (gaining unit).
     1.18.3.1. Do not request a training quota until host MAJCOM approves request for
     attachment. Each aircrew member scheduled for training will provide an endorsement
     letter signed by the supervisor certifying the individual is available for the required TDY
     and there is no known pending change (permanent change of station, rated position
     identifier code, etc.) that would preclude retention in a flying position for at least 2 years
     after course completion.
  1.18.4. Senior Officer Training coordination. All Senior Officer training is directed by
  AF/DPO, AF/DPG offices in coordination with MAJCOM Senior Leaders Management
  office and AMC/A3TF. Questions regarding Senior Officer training course, availability and
  prerequisites can be forwarded to HQ AMC/A3TF @ DSN 779-3577. No formal actions to
  schedule training will be taken until directed by AF/DPO or AF/DPG in conjunction with
  MAJCOM Senior Leaders Management offices.

                                            Chapter 2

                            INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General Requirements. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 defines initial qualification training. This
chapter specifies minimum training requirements for initial qualification, re-qualification,
conversion/difference qualification, and senior officer courses.           Initial qualification is
accomplished by completion of formal training course or by completion of contractor developed
formal simulator training course and flight training at Executive Airlift Training Center (EATC)
for C-20 and C-37 pilots and flight engineers or in unit, as applicable (EATC is N/A for ANG).
2.2. Initial Qualification Training Prerequisites. Complete initial qualification prerequisites
in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1, the ETCA website, this instruction, and the course
syllabus. The student may begin training (e.g., CBT) prior to the start of a formal initial
qualification course. See ETCA web site at: https://etca.randolph.af.mil/default1.asp
   2.2.1. Initial qualification. On completion of initial qualification training, crewmembers will
   be classified as basic aircraft qualified (BAQ). Crewmembers must then comply with
   mission qualification (Chapter 3) and continuation training (Chapter 4) requirements.
        2.2.1.1. Navigators, CSOs, FEs and FAs may train on operational missions. Therefore,
        initial qualification and mission qualification training may occur simultaneously.
   2.2.2. In-unit training in lieu of formal school. When training classes are not available, units
   may request waivers to conduct in-unit qualification training using formal school courseware.
   In-unit training for AFRC personnel should begin no later than 90 days after reporting or
   being attached to a new duty station or unit. The appropriate MAJCOM/A3T (DOT/A3T) or
   NGB/A3O is the waiver authority.
2.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete ground training requirements for initial
qualification in accordance AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and this instruction.
   2.3.1. If events in Table 2.1 are not accomplished at a Formal Training Unit (FTU), they
   must be completed at the gaining unit.

3. One time event, per base assignment.
4. Total Force Awareness Training. See AF Portal for link to web-based training.
5. Flight Physical and Physiological Training are tracked on the top of each crewmember’s
Individual Training Summary (ITS). Therefore, there is no need to assign and track these
training events in the training module of ARMS.
6. Not required for BAQ or Senior Officers.
7. One time event per aircraft. G231 is a onetime event per primary assigned aircraft for FS.
8. Flight Surgeons on mobility accomplish this event.
 20                                                                 AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010


 9. One-time requirement prior to first flight at every assignment (N/A at FTU). Reference AFI
 16-1301, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape Program, for details.


2.4. Flying Training Requirements. Complete flying training requirements for initial
qualification in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1 and this instruction.
2.5. Conversion/Difference Qualification Training Requirements. Conversion/Difference
Training guidance may be found in AFI 11-202, Volume 1. When possible, qualified personnel
in other units will provide the initial cadre. In some instances, it will be necessary for units to
form an initial cadre of aircrew personnel for whom certain training qualification requirements
may be waived. Initial cadre should be restricted to only those instructors and evaluators
required to establish a core training force and not to alleviate training difficulties or shortfalls.
The following conditions will apply to the management of initial cadre aircrew qualification:
   2.5.1. Conversion Training. Form a nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel
   (initial cadre) to begin aircrew conversion. Converting units may request initial cadre waiver
   of PAI time requirement. Send waivers request through MAJCOM/A3TA (DOT/A3T) or
   NGB/A3O in the format in paragraph 1.5.6. Additionally, include the most recent aircraft
   flown and total time in that aircraft in the remarks section.
       2.5.1.1. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held
       unless previously qualified in the conversion aircraft.
       2.5.1.2. After final approval, publish a unit letter to identify initial cadre of instructors
       and flight examiners by crew qualification.
   2.5.2. Difference Training. Complete difference qualification training (DQT) to qualify
   crewmembers in a different model aircraft within the same Mission Design Series (MDS) in-
   unit or in conjunction with simulator training. When crewmembers complete DQT for a
   MDS aircraft having the same mission as their current model, there is no requirement for
   additional mission qualification training. Apply DQT for major modifications (i.e., Global
   Air Traffic Management (GATM)-compliant avionics, flight management computer (FMC)
   differences) as directed by MAJCOM. Difference training may be applied to SAM-CSM-
   DVG MDS transfers. For fleet-wide modifications, apply initial cadre criteria in paragraph
   2.5.1
       2.5.2.1. Crewmembers will meet all initial qualification requirements in one aircraft prior
       to entering differences training in another model aircraft. EXCEPTION: Gulfstream
       FAs may accomplish simultaneous training in all Gulfstream models.
       2.5.2.2. Crewmembers will initially qualify in a new Gulfstream model aircraft to a crew
       qualification no higher than the qualification they maintain in their current Gulfstream
       model. The minimum training requirements to transition between Gulfstream aircraft are
       as follows:
           2.5.2.2.1. Pilot and Flight Engineer qualification. Initial contractor simulator training
           and unit upgrade training requirements, and a differences SPOT evaluation.
           2.5.2.2.2. Aircraft commander (MP) certification requires a minimum of two
           operational missions and certification by an instructor.
AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010                                                                         21


           2.5.2.2.3. Instructor pilot (IP) certification requires a minimum of two right seat local
           training sorties (one local training sortie may be replaced by two right seat simulator
           periods flown real time with an instructor), and certification by an instructor.
       2.5.2.3. Upon qualifying in another Gulfstream model, an entry will be made in the
       aircrew member’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF), reflecting this qualification/difference
       training.
   2.5.3. Prior Qualification/Cross flow. Upon PCS to gaining unit, aircrew personnel still
   qualified in the same model of SAM-CSM-DVG aircraft as that they will fly at gaining unit
   will be considered qualified at same level; however, local area orientation must be
   accomplished. Refer to MAJCOM Supplement for additional guidance. OG/CC and/or unit
   commander may elect at any point to enter newly hired crewmembers into full
   mission/qualification process.
2.6. Multiple Qualifications. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 contains multiple qualification training
guidance. Crewmembers maintaining multiple qualifications in different model aircraft will, as a
minimum, maintain FTL A currency requirements in each aircraft for pilots and navigators (N/A
for senior officers; see paragraph 2.7.). See Table 4.2. through Table 4.6. for requirements.
2.7. Senior Officer Qualification Training Requirements. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 identifies
senior officer qualification requirements. These officers are assigned FTL E for continuation
training purposes and will not fly unsupervised in a primary crew position (see paragraph
4.3.1.5., and paragraph 4.3.2.4.).
   2.7.1. After qualification IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and with OG/CC approval, senior
   officers (assigned or attached) may seek training which leads to a higher FTL and/or
   qualification. The unit OSS/OST office is responsible for determining training requirements
   based on the senior officer’s flying experience and familiarity with the weapons system. HQ
   AMC/A3T or appropriate MAJCOM DOT/A3T will approve the proposed training plan prior
   to execution.
2.8. Re-qualification Training (RQT). An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration of
the qualification evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items specified in
Chapter 4), or completion of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS (EXCEPTION:
When authorized multiple qualification). The duration of unqualified time is from the date the
aircrew member became unqualified until the specific retraining start date. For Active Duty
Service Commitments for aircrew training, see AFI 36-2107. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1 for
additional re-qualification training limits and requirements.
   2.8.1. For in-unit re-qualification training, initiate a waiver request (see paragraph 1.5.).
   Follow training event requirements in the appropriate re-qualification course syllabus except
   as noted in the waiver request.
   2.8.2. Basic and instructor re-qualification may be conducted simultaneously on a case-by-
   case basis. Initiate a waiver request and include proposed training events to regain instructor
   status. When used, the unit will compare re-qualification syllabus and instructor syllabus and
   provide a recommendation of training events in the request to include an instructor
   evaluation.

                                          Chapter 3

            MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. Description. This chapter establishes minimum criteria and training requirements for
mission qualification training. Except where specifically stated, squadrons may arrange mission
sequence or sequence of items as necessary to use flying training hours effectively and
accomplish the unit mission. Both pilots must be qualified when passengers are on board
according to AFI 11-401.
3.2. Time Periods for Mission Certification Training. See paragraph 1.7 and Table 1.2 A
crewmember will be mission ready (MR) after completion of all ground training and flying
training requirements, review and certification by Sq/CC or Review and Certification (R&C)
Board for aircraft commander (AC) according to AFI 11-202V2 AMC Supplement.
   3.2.1. Mission ready (MR) requirements must be completed prior to being deemed mission
   ready. Local training or operational missions may be flown before completing all MR items,
   provided the qualified aircrew member has a current flight physical, and has completed
   physiological, initial ground egress, marshaling (Pilot/FE), and aircrew flight equipment
   familiarization.
3.3. Ground Training Requirements. All crewmembers will accomplish events in Table 3.1.
(not applicable to senior officers or staff officers maintaining BAQ). Ensure ground training
requirements in Table 2.1 are accomplished.

NOTES:
1. Not required to be accomplished prior to flight evaluation. Required before certification or
deemed Mission Ready. See MAJCOM supplement for MAJCOM requirements.
2. Does not apply to Navigators.
3. Flight Surgeons on mobility accomplish these events.
4. Will be accomplished before the first flight.
5. One-time requirement prior to first flight at every assignment (N/A at FTU). Reference AFI
16-1301, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape Program, for details.


3.4. Flying Training Requirements.
   3.4.1. Basic aircraft qualified (BAQ) crewmembers pursuing MR status will accomplish
   FTL C (see paragraph 4.2.) continuation training requirements. Upon completion of mission
   qualification training, crewmember’s training level will be immediately changed as
   appropriate and prorated from the date mission qualification status was gained.
   3.4.2. Local Area Orientation. After arrival at duty station, pilots, navigators, and flight
   engineers will receive a local area briefing and a local orientation flight (not applicable for
   in-unit initial, re-qualification or upgrade training). This orientation will familiarize
   crewmembers with the local flying area, local area flying procedures, and introduce any
   unit/mission unique procedures.
       3.4.2.1. The lack of a local area orientation does not preclude the crewmember from
       deploying as MR. Crewmember must accomplish all grounding items prior to the local
       orientation flight.
       3.4.2.2. Crewmembers do not have to be at the controls to complete the event. More
       than one crewmember may be trained at a time. With OG/CC (or equivalent) approval,
       the orientation may be completed on operational missions on a non interference basis.
   3.4.3. Categories II and III ILS Aircrew Training. If not accomplished during initial
   qualification training and annotated on AF IMT 8, Cat II/III training and certification will be
   accomplished during Mission Qualification Training.
   3.4.4. Enhanced Vision System (EVS) Aircrew Training. If not accomplished during initial
   qualification training and annotated on AF IMT 8, EVS training and certification will be
   accomplished during Mission Qualification training.
 24                                                                 AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010


3.5. Theater Indoctrination (TI). Theater indoctrination (M060) will be conducted according
to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and this instruction.
   3.5.1. For pilots and flight engineers, training should include (at a minimum) a thorough
   review of theater unique instrument requirements and procedures, use of non-DoD
   instrument approach procedures, required instrumentation for specific approaches, theater
   weather conditions, local area procedures, and host nation agreements.
   3.5.2. Unit commanders are responsible for the accomplishment of this training for all
   assigned and attached crewmembers and will design a program to meet requirements unique
   to unit operations. Completion of TI training does not require attainment of MR status.
3.6. Category II/III ILS and EVS Training. This prescribes the training program for pilots
and copilots in aircraft that are command-certified for category II/IIIA ILS and EVS operations.
Cat II/III and EVS training and certification will normally be conducted at ATS contracted
simulator.
   3.6.1. Seat occupancy requirements. A qualified category II/III ILS or EVS instructor or
   flight examiner pilot will occupy the appropriate seat, as applicable, during pilot category
   II/III ILS and EVS training.
   3.6.2. Training weather and runway requirements. Actual weather - no lower than a 200 foot
   ceiling and ½ mile visibility (runway visual range of 24) or 800 meters day and night.
   Crosswind component - 15 Knots maximum. Runway length - at least computed landing
   distance (brakes and speed brakes) plus 2,000 feet.
   3.6.3. Normally, the following ground and flight training requirements will be incorporated
   into the initial aircraft qualification course:
       3.6.3.1. Ground Training. The training program must provide pilots training in the
       following subjects:
           3.6.3.1.1. Operational characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of category II/III
           ILS or EVS and visual aids, e.g., approach lights, in-runway lights, transmissometers,
           etc.
           3.6.3.1.2. Using runway environment visual cues during category II/III or EVS
           weather conditions, with respect to different glide slope angles, cockpit cutoff angles,
           and altitudes at which these visual cues are normally discernible.
           3.6.3.1.3. Operational characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of category II/III
           ILS or EVS airborne systems, e.g. flight director system; automatic approach coupler;
           system used to identify the decision height for category II/III approaches,
           instrumentation, and other systems and devices peculiar to the aircraft.
           3.6.3.1.4. Resolution of decision height or missed approach point or minimum
           descent altitude with component failures (ground or aircraft).
       3.6.3.2. Flight Training. Flight or simulator training will cover the following subjects:
           3.6.3.2.1. Resolution of decision height.
           3.6.3.2.2. Missed approach procedures.
           3.6.3.2.3. Runway visual range, uses, and limitations.
AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010                                                                      25


           3.6.3.2.4. Transition from instrument to visual flight cues.
           3.6.3.2.5. Effects of vertical and horizontal wind shear.
           3.6.3.2.6. Review of category II/III or EVS specifications.
           3.6.3.2.7. Practice at least one approach in each authorized equipment mode.
3.7. Category II/III ILS Training Certification. This applies to pilots in aircraft that are
command-certified for category II/III ILS or EVS operations.
   3.7.1. Eligibility. Pilots should be administered initial category II/III ILS or EVS training
   and evaluation during their initial qualification training. If not accomplished at that time,
   category II/III ILS or EVS training will be accomplished during MQT.
   3.7.2. Scheduling. Two otherwise qualified pilots may receive category II/III ILS or EVS
   training and certification on the same flight while occupying seats together and supervised by
   instructor/evaluator. When a single pilot is receiving training and certification, a qualified
   category II/II ILS or EVS pilot will occupy the opposite seat.
3.8. Aircraft Defensive Systems. Does not need to be tracked as a separate certification but
should be included in local orientation or differences training. Training should include academic
and flight training. See Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) Volume 3-3 for
unclassified defensive systems information and AFTTP 3-1 for classified defensive information.

                                           Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Description. This chapter establishes the minimum flying and related ground training
requirements to maintain currency. The unit commander will ensure crewmembers receive
sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency.
4.2. Aircrew Status. Crewmembers are assigned to Mission Ready (MR), Basic Mission
Capable (BMC), Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ), or Non-Mission Ready (NMR) status.
   4.2.1. Mission Ready (MR). A mission-ready crewmember is defined as one who is current,
   qualified, and if required, certified in the squadron’s mission (completed mission
   qualification training for applicable crew position). An aircrew member that has failed to
   maintain currency in all events required for MR Status reverts to BMC Status. The aircrew
   member may not fly outside of the CONUS until regaining currency in those events.
      4.2.1.1. A flight attendant qualified as FT is considered MR and can fly unsupervised in
      the FT position. The flight attendant is FT qualified after completing training
      requirements and an evaluation.
   4.2.2. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A non-mission ready crewmember assigned to
   MAJCOM headquarters, NAF, TACC, AMWC, tanker airlift control element, formal
   schoolhouse, or direct reporting unit who has satisfactorily completed mission qualification
   training and does not maintain MR status, but maintains familiarization in the command or
   unit operational mission. The crewmember may maintain qualification in some aspects of
   the unit mission and is able to attain full qualification in the unit mission within 45-days.
   BMC crewmembers may log instructor or evaluator time for the portion of the mission for
   which they are current and qualified. An aircrew member that has failed to maintain
   currency in events required for BMC Status reverts to BAQ Status. The aircrew member is
   not allowed to fly operational missions until regaining currency in those events.
   4.2.3. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). A crewmember that has satisfactorily completed
   training and is qualified to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft. See AFI 11-202,
   Volume 1. An aircrew member that has failed to maintain currency in events required for
   BAQ status reverts to FLY status. The aircrew member must fly with an instructor on all
   sorties until regaining currency in those events. Pilots will fly without passengers onboard
   until regaining currency in those events also.
   4.2.4. Loss of FLY Status. An aircrew member that has failed to maintain currency in
   events required for FLY Status will not fly until the overdue events are accomplished.
   4.2.5. Non-Mission Ready (NMR). An individual who is non-current or unqualified in the
   aircraft, incomplete in required ground and/or flight continuation training, or not certified to
   perform the unit mission is a NMR crewmember. See paragraph 4.7. and paragraph 4.8.
      4.2.5.1. If an aircrew member is NMR for failure to complete required continuation
      training, the OG/CC has two options:
          4.2.5.1.1. Waive the required training in accordance with paragraph 4.8. The
          individual is then a MR aircrew member. This should be accomplished at the earliest
AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010                                                                     27


          opportunity. Waivers for training or currency events missed in consecutive training
          periods require MAJCOM approval.
          4.2.5.1.2. Place the aircrew member in supervised status according to paragraph
          4.2.5.2.
       4.2.5.2. If the crewmember is NMR for failure to maintain currency per paragraph 4.8.,
       place the aircrew member in supervised status for that event (individual flies with an
       instructor of like specialty) until required training is accomplished.
4.3. Flying Training Levels (FTL).
   4.3.1. The Sq/CC or designated representative determines the TL before each semiannual
   period. Assign new unit crewmembers a TL during in-processing. Base TL determinations
   on experience and proficiency. Crewmembers may be assigned TL levels that are more
   restrictive, but never less restrictive than the requirements under this paragraph. TL
   definitions follow:
       4.3.1.1. FTL A - Highly Experienced Crewmembers. This may include wing, operations
       group, and unit commanders; operations officers, personnel assigned to OG evaluation
       positions and any instructors assigned primarily to staff duties. Unit commanders may
       assign highly experienced MR line crewmembers to this level. Individuals may or may
       not maintain mission ready status. NOTE: NMR crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM
       headquarters, NAF, TACC, AMWC, CRW, AMOGs, combat crew training schools
       (CCTS) or a direct reporting unit are categorized as BMC and assigned to FTL A. In
       addition, these individuals must also accomplish annual CRM training requirements.
       These individuals may fly unsupervised on CONUS training missions provided they are
       current and qualified. They require instructor supervision on all other missions.
       4.3.1.2. FTL B - Experienced, mission ready crewmembers.
       4.3.1.3. FTL C – Mission ready crewmembers. Inexperienced crewmembers should be
       designated FTL ―C‖.
       4.3.1.4. FTL D – No longer used.
       4.3.1.5. FTL E - BAQ, Non-Instructor Staff (may include senior officers, MAJCOM,
       NAF, and TACC individuals who are not maintaining MR or instructor status). FTL E
       requirements are sufficient for BAQ and BMC status, but are insufficient for MR status.
       Crewmembers assigned to FTL E will fly with an instructor of like specialty at all times.
   4.3.2. Change of FTL. Once the semi-annual period begins, do not move a crewmember to a
   level requiring fewer events. EXCEPTION: Units associating FTLs with crew positions
   may change FTLs after upgrade i.e. instructor upgrade. Place BAQ crewmembers into a
   different FTL any time after attaining MR status. Prorate events upon changing training
   levels.
4.4. Training Events/Tables. Standardized ARMS training requirement identifiers and
descriptions are located in Chapter 7. Unit defined requirements will be designated ―X‖ events
(i.e., X020) and listed in MAJCOM Supplement.
   4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment.      Credit events accomplished on training,
   operational missions, and satisfactory evaluations toward currency requirements and
 28                                                               AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010


   establish a subsequent due date. Use date of evaluation as the date of accomplishment for all
   flying training currency events that were successfully accomplished during the formal course
   evaluation. Continuation training events accomplished during upgrade training prior to the
   evaluation may be credited towards the requirements for the current crew position. Do not
   log training events for the upgrading crew position prior to the evaluation.
   4.4.2. Unsatisfactory flight evaluation. Do not log continuation training requirements for
   those qualifications graded Q-3 until re-qualified.
   4.4.3. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.
   EXCEPTION: Not applicable to phase training CBTs.
   4.4.4. Instructor training requirements and responsibilities. Instructors and flight examiners
   may credit 50 percent of their total requirements while instructing or evaluating.
   EXCEPTION: Instructor and flight examiner pilots may not credit any takeoffs, landings, or
   air refueling flown by another pilot.
   4.4.5. FTU OG/CCs may determine, obtain MAJCOM approval, and publish ground and
   flying continuation training requirements in local training procedures.
   4.4.6. Documenting Aircrew Training.
      4.4.6.1. All training events will be recorded in ARMS. Training events conducted
      during block training or phase training may be consolidated under one ARMS entry.
      Combined training events may have only one ARMS entry. Input all one-time events and
      events required for permanent change-of-station (PCS) in the ARMS database. Units
      may maintain one-time events on the crewmember’s currency report.
   4.4.7. Simulator Credit for Training Events. Crewmembers may log continuation flying
   events accomplished in the simulator (FAA certified Level C or better) unless otherwise
   specified by the respective event description in Chapter 7, MAJCOM Supplement, or Table
   4.2 Pilots may maintain or regain currency through events accomplished in the simulator.
   4.4.8. Simulator Refresher Course Requirements. If the airline training program and
   simulator are approved by HQ AFRC/A3T or NGB/A3O, one semiannual refresher currency
   requirement can be met by performance of required maneuvers during an individual’s
   commercial airline proficiency training for the corresponding semiannual period in which a
   check ride is not required, if the individual is currently qualified on the same FAA type rated
   aircraft.
4.5. Ground Continuation Training Requirements.
   4.5.1. Completion and tracking of continuation training is ultimately the responsibility of the
   individual crewmember. Crewmembers should actively work with unit schedulers and
   training offices to ensure their continuation training is accomplished as described in this
   chapter.
   4.5.2. Crewmembers (including Flight Surgeons) will comply with requirements of Table
   4.1 see Chapter 7 for event descriptions. Failure to accomplish requirements in Table 4.1
   will result in non-mission ready status. See paragraph 4.10.to regain mission ready status.
   Failure to complete mobility training requirements shown at bottom of Table 4.1. does not
   lead to non-mission ready status but may restrict crewmember from certain missions.
AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010                                                                   29


   Ancillary training events do not affect mission ready status nor restrict crewmembers from
   any mission.
   4.5.3. Attached crewmembers (i.e. AMC, CVAM, etc.) may accomplish ground training
   events at locations other than their units of attachment. The event must be approved (i.e.,
   meets training standards) by the MAJCOM/A3TA. Individuals are responsible for reporting
   all accomplished training to their unit of attachment ARMS office.

3. Flight Surgeons and Multiple Qualified crewmembers must accomplish this requirement in
each aircraft they fly
4. Flight Physical and Physiological Training are tracked on the top of each crewmember’s
Individual Training Summary (ITS). Therefore there is no longer a need to assign and track
these training events in the training module of ARMS. This is a mandatory grounding item on
expiration date. Individual will not fly until required event is accomplished. Flight Physical
expires on the last day of the birth month. Physiological Training expires 5 years after the last
day of the month in which previously accomplished.
5. As required for unit mission. Requirement is determined by OG/CC.
6. Not required for BAQ or BMC crewmembers. Local sorties/CONUS Training Missions may
be accomplished while non-current for this event.

NOTES:
1. These events are determined by OG/CC.
2. Pilots and flight engineers should dual log an M010 during semiannual refresher simulator
training. Difference qualified (C-20/37) crewmembers must accomplish one event in each type
aircraft or simulator. See paragraph 7.6 for additional guidance. (PAG exempt).
3. Applies only to C-32, C-40B/C, and VC-25 aircraft.
4. Applies only to equipped aircraft. RNP/SAAAR approaches require both special aircraft
authorization and aircrew certification training to fly this type of procedure. If a RNP/SAAAR
approach is accomplished a RNAV/GPS approach may also be logged. See Chapter 7 for
additional information and requirements.
5. Multiple qualified crewmembers may accomplish event in either MDS. If a Cat III ILS
approach is accomplishing a Cat II approach may also be logged.
6. Requirement is for Aircraft Commander. OG/CC may authorize for FPN. Once tactics
certification is complete, pilots incur the semi-annual requirement. Tactics events may be
accomplished from the left or right seat. Tactical events may not be credited by observing from
the jump seat. Recommend units accomplish tactics training prior to deployment. PAG & C-9
are exempt.
7. Difference qualified (C-20/37) pilots only.
8. If a NDB approach is not available, use RMI only procedures.
9. Unqualified in the aircraft if non-current in excess of 6 months.
10. P/FE requirement. OG/CC may direct that G250 be accomplished in quarterly increments
to meet unit training requirements. Frequency cannot be less than semiannual (PAG and C-9
exempted). A G250 (Sim with academics) can be logged in one SA period and a Proficiency
Simulator or Recurrent Simulator in the following SA period satisfies the SA requirement.
11. CRM Simulator (G240) may be accomplished during the Simulator Refresher course
(G250) and dual logged. A separate CRM simulator profile is not required during G250 if
CRM is briefed, utilized, and debriefed for each simulator mission.
AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010                                                                      35


 12. M030 is not creditable in the simulator. OG/CCs may substitute CONUS operational
 sorties for overseas sorties. M030 may be accomplished from the left, right, or jump seat.

4.8. Ancillary Training. Ancillary training is guidance or instruction that contributes to
mission accomplishment, but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series. AFI
11-2VIP, Volume 1 is not the governing directive for completion of ancillary training events. In
accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1, the source AFI provides training frequency for these
events unless an approved waiver has been authorized. See Unit Deployment Manger
representative to ensure compliance with additional non-aircrew specific training requirements.
4.9. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 outlines proration of training requirements
for crewmembers not available for flying duties or those changing training levels. Perform the
following formula steps to determine training requirements for a select training period:
Step 1 – Convert number of days available to number of months available (See Table 4.7.).
Step 2 – Look up event currency required.
Step 3 – Determine prorated event volume required using the following formula:
       Number of Months Available
          X Event Volume
          ÷ 6 (Number of Months in the Semiannual training period)
= Prorated event volume required (round down to nearest whole number but not less than 1)
   4.9.1. Use Table 4.7 to determine the number of months available. Prorate only if absence
   is at least 15 cumulative days.
AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010                                                                       37


   4.9.2. When an individual permanently changes station (PCS) to a unit flying the same
   model aircraft and enters the same training level or lower, credit may be taken for training
   accomplished at the previous base. Prorate training requirements based on the time available
   (time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number of days not available) during the
   training period. Time available starts 7 days after sign-in for CONUS and 14 days after sign-
   in for OCONUS. Subtract previous accomplishments from the prorated total to determine
   remaining requirements.
   4.9.3. Units may also prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels.         If
   requirements are prorated do not credit events accomplished while in the former FTL.

4.10. Failure to Complete Training Requirements. Declare individuals NMR if they fail to
maintain flying currency, fail to complete semiannual flying continuation training requirements,
or fail to complete ground continuation training requirements. The following guidance applies:
   4.10.1. Crew members non-current the day after event currency expires; (i.e., a crewmember
   that accomplished an event with monthly currency on 1 September becomes non-current on 1
   November). If a crewmember is NMR for failure to complete required continuation training,
   the OG/CC has two options:
         4.10.1.1. Waive the required training. The individual remains on MR status.
         4.10.1.2. Place the crewmember in supervised status for that event (individual flies with
         an instructor of like specialty) until required training is accomplished.
   4.10.2. Loss of Currency. Place individuals delinquent in one or more currency events in
   supervised training status for that event and declare them NMR in those unit missions
   requiring that event. Crewmembers are non-current the day after event currency expires;
   (i.e., an aircrew member who accomplished an event with monthly currency on 1 September
   becomes non-current on 1 November).
   4.10.3. Regaining Currency.
 38                                                                 AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010


      4.10.3.1. For a loss of currency up to 6-months, a crewmember must demonstrate
      proficiency in the aircraft or simulator (as appropriate as defined in Table 4.2, 4.3, 4.4,
      4.5, or 4.6) with an Air Force instructor (or ATS instructor for simulator creditable
      events) in all delinquent items. Crewmembers non-current for up to 6-months will
      maintain their current training level (no documentation required).
      4.10.3.2. Loss of currency exceeding 6-months. For events identified in Table 4.2, 4.3,
      4.4, 4.5, or 4.6, as leading to unqualified status, the crewmember is unqualified in the
      aircraft and must complete Sq/CC-directed requalification training and an aircrew
      evaluation. For all other currency events, regain currency by demonstrating proficiency
      in the aircraft or simulator to the satisfaction of an Air Force instructor (or ATS instructor
      for simulator creditable events) in all delinquent items.
   4.10.4. Failure to Complete Semi-annual Flying Training Events. The OG/CC or equivalent
   may waive flying continuation training and currency events. At the end of each training
   period, the squadron commander will review ARMS products for those crewmembers who
   failed to accomplish all required flying training events (includes all events listed in the flying
   continuation training tables Table 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, or 4.6). The squadron commander will
   either direct training necessary for the individual to regain MR status or request OG/CC
   waiver. If the ARMS review shows enough flying events were recently accomplished to
   ensure MR proficiency, OG/CC or equivalent may waive the requirements. This waiver
   authority must be used judiciously. The intent is to ensure crewmembers receive the proper
   quantity of flying events to remain proficient and allow OG/CC to determine MR status and
   additional training requirements when those training quotas are not met. Waivers for training
   or currency events missed in consecutive training periods require MAJCOM approval.
   4.10.5. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events. The OG/CC or equivalent may waive
   ground continuation training events identified in Table 4.1. This waiver authority will be
   used judiciously. The decision to grant a waiver will be based on the individual
   crewmember’s experience and proficiency level (i.e. waivers will not be based on a
   crewmember’s availability). OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the waiver.
   The make-up training should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity. This waiver is for
   unforeseen circumstances only and only for events that will not degrade mission
   accomplishment.
4.11. Requirements Before PCS or TDY by Rated Members on Active Flying Status.
   4.11.1. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 specifies requirements before PCS or TDY.
4.12. Requirements Before Removal from Active Flying Status.

                                                  UPGRADE TRAINING

5.1. Description. This chapter identifies general prerequisites and training requirements for
upgrade.
         5.1.1. General. The flying time prerequisites for upgrade are based on the crewmember
         having gained the knowledge and judgment required to effectively accomplish the unit’s
         missions. Sq/CCs will ensure their continuation training programs emphasize these areas.
         Flying experience must include left seat time before entering formal school upgrade training.
         Crewmembers will have an in-depth knowledge of systems, procedures, and instructions
         before entering the formal upgrade program.
         5.1.2. OG/CC is designated waiver authority for flying hour prerequisites for entry into
         formal upgrade courses.

 NOTES:
 1. Pilots remaining in BAQ status (certain staff positions, etc.) are required an Initial
 Instrument/Qualification flight evaluation and unit commander certification board. Pilots
 progressing onto mission ready status do not require a certification board for initial
 instrument/qualification.
 2. Recommended by an instructor with the concurrence of the operations officer.
 3. Total/PAA time may be further restricted by OG/CC. See MAJCOM Supplement.
 4. All flying-hour requirements must be attained prior to entry into an IP upgrade program.
 5. The unit training chief must ensure AF IMT 63, is signed prior to beginning initial or
 upgrade training according to AFI 36-2107. Prior MDS instructor crewmembers going
 through instructor upgrade in-unit incur no ADSC.
 6. Applies to ANG only.
 7. Total flying hours represents all flying time logged aboard a fixed wing aircraft as a
 ―military‖ pilot including UPT, Student, and ―Other‖ time (but does not include time in
 another aircrew specialty). Simulator time is not credible to meet total flying hour
 requirement.


5.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD). MPD is the AMC continuous upgrade process
designed to develop Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) graduates through aircraft
commander qualification. VIPSAM pilots have been aircraft commanders in other major
weapon systems (MWS) and enter training as cross flow pilots. The MPD program includes the
Pilot Initial Qualification (PIQ) formal training course, continuation training and the Pilot
Check-out (PCO) training. All MPD pilots will be dual-seat qualified. MPD pilots are not
Aircraft Commanders but should be considered in continuous aircraft commander training upon
graduation from the PIQ course until AC certification. Training timelines are based on Table
5.1 and should be tailored to match an individual’s capabilities and experience level.
     5.2.1. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD) Overview.
            5.2.1.1. Squadrons must ensure that PIQs get balanced exposure to the left and right
            seats to ensure proficiency and currency with the flying and non-flying duties in both seat
 42                                                                              AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010


          positions.   Squadron Commanders will ensure pilots receive sufficient training
          opportunities to gain experience prior to Aircraft Commander Upgrade.
          5.2.1.2. MPD Continuation Training. This training involves both instrument simulator
          sorties (ISS) and flying training conducted during local and mission sorties.
          5.2.1.3. Certification. A crewmember will be mission ready (MR) after completion of all
          ground training and flying training requirements. Additionally, Aircraft Commanders
          must be certified by the Sq/CC or Review and Certification (R & C) Board before
          performing duties as Pilot in Command (PIC).
     5.2.2. MPD Designation Codes. AFI 11-401 defines pilot aviation codes.                    For
     standardization, use the codes from Table 5.2 (3rd letter designator distinguishes the status
     for a MPD pilot who completed formal training with evaluation (graduate). This ARMS
     code does not affect the ML qualification status listed on the AF Form 8. Use the following
     ARMS codes to define pilot qualification or certification status:

5.3. Aircraft Commander (MP). See minimum flying-hour requirements in Table 5.1
   5.3.1. General. The flying time prerequisites for upgrade are based on the pilot having
   gained the knowledge and judgment required to effectively accomplish the unit’s missions.
   Sq/CCs will ensure their continuation training programs emphasize these areas. AC
   candidates will have an in-depth knowledge of systems, procedures, and instructions before
   entering the formal upgrade program. The following guidance applies:
          5.3.1.1. AC Candidate. All MPD pilots are in continuous aircraft commander upgrade
          training and are considered AC candidates.
          5.3.1.2. MPD Pilot Checkout. The process for aircraft commander certification will
          include the MPD Pilot Checkout Course (PCO) which culminates in an Operational
          Mission Evaluation.
          5.3.1.3. AC Certification. Pilots will not be designated pilot in command until certified
          as an aircraft commander by the Sq/CC. Pilots will complete all ―tasks and events
          required‖ in Table 5.1.
   5.3.2. Global Ready Aircraft Commander Course (GRACC). GRACC is a multi-step
   process designed to familiarize the new mobility aircraft commander with the intricacies of
   operating in the AMC en route system. GRACC is not required for VIPSAM pilots,
   however, VIPSAM pilots are invited to attend. One time course completion is transferable
   between all AMC weapons systems. Previous or current MAF aircraft commanders do not
   have to take this course. Waiver authority is OG/CC or equivalent.
          5.3.2.1. GRAC training guides can be downloaded from the AMC/A3T web site, AMC
          en route training link. HQ AMC Orientation Tours can be scheduled via email with
          AMC/A3TF (A3T.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil) or at DSN 779-3576.
5.4. Aircrew Instructor Program. Course is designed to teach selected crewmembers
fundamentals and concepts of instructing. Instructor candidates will be selected based on
experience, judgment, ability to instruct, flying skill, and technical knowledge.
   5.4.1. Prerequisites.       See Table 5.1, Table 5.3. and this section for instructor upgrade
   prerequisites.
          5.4.1.1. Instructor Preparatory Course (IPC). All instructor candidates must have
          attended an IPC at a formal Air Force school or at the unit level.
             5.4.1.1.1. IPC Guidance. Unit level IPC will be conducted according to a plan
             submitted to and approved by the appropriate operations group and MAJCOM
             training office. Primary instructors will maintain course content and update when
 44                                                               AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010


           necessary. A record of course attendees will be maintained for at least 2 calendar
           years. An AF Form 1256, Certificate of Training will be issued to each graduate and
           signed by the primary instructor. Unit level IPC operating instructions are permitted
           and encouraged.
           5.4.1.1.2. Unit level IPC. Each IPC program will have a primary instructor
           appointed by the applicable squadron commander to be responsible for course
           content, scheduling, records, and training of new IPC instructors. IPC staff may be of
           any size but should be limited to only enough to accomplish unit requirements.
   5.4.2. Ground Training.
       5.4.2.1. An instructor must be thoroughly familiar with aircraft systems and equipment,
       normal and emergency operating procedures, prohibited maneuvers, and aircraft
       performance under all conditions of flight. Instructor candidates will demonstrate
       knowledge by organizing and conducting ground briefings on a cross-section of subjects
       from applicable directives. Briefings may be conducted as part of the existing
       continuation training or flying safety program, but the briefing must be critiqued by a
       same crew position instructor for content, organization, and delivery.
       5.4.2.2. The instructor candidate will receive ground training on training documentation
       requirements.
       5.4.2.3. Instructor candidates from all crew positions will satisfactorily complete written
       examinations prior to qualification or requalification. Examinations will be prepared,
       administered and controlled by the ATS contractor or unit A3V/CCV, according to AFI
       11-202, Volume 2 and AFI 11-2VIP Volume 2. Record examination results on an AF
       IMT 8.
   5.4.3. Flying Training.
       5.4.3.1. IP candidates may occupy either seat during training. Emphasis will be on right-
       seat proficiency, maneuver techniques, practice instruction, practical emergency situation
       set-up, and operating aircraft systems. A minimum of one touch and go landing should
       be accomplished in the left seat, emphasizing the differences in cockpit layout and
       aircrew duties that affect left seat instructing.
       5.4.3.2. An initial instructor flight evaluation is required and validated by certification
       board. Instructor candidates will demonstrate to a flight examiner their ability to instruct
       and perform selected maneuvers and items according to applicable directives.
       5.4.3.3. Instructor proficiency guidelines. In the first quarter, following upgrade,
       emphasis should be placed on flying the newly certified IP in the local pattern to
       reinforce upgrade training and to gain experience in the local flying environment.
5.5. Flight Examiner Upgrade. Squadron commanders will identify instructors for flight
examiner certification. Instructors identified for certification as flight evaluator must possess
satisfactory knowledge of AFI 11-202, Volume 2, AFI 11-2VIP Volume 2, and applicable
MAJCOM supplements. All flight examiners must be fully qualified instructors (EXCEPTION:
NAF/CC or OG/CC).

                                                      - Certification board

 NOTES:
 1. Recommended by an instructor with the concurrence of the operations officer.
 2. Hours and time requirements will be established by squadron CC. See MAJCOM
 Supplement.
 3. The unit training chief must ensure AF IMT 63, is signed prior to beginning initial or
 upgrade training according to AFI 36-2107. Prior MDS instructor crewmembers going
 through instructor upgrade in-unit incur no ADSC.


5.7. Special Qualifications and Certifications. Certain aircrew qualifications and
certifications are trained after completion of formal qualification and do not affect mission ready
status. Special qualifications and certifications may require an evaluation or only an AF Form
4324 update. These programs are usually taught at the unit level by Air Force instructors of like
specialty.
     5.7.1. Pilot Tactics Certification. This section outlines the qualification and continuation
     requirements for a pilot fly tactical flight procedures. NOTE: Maneuvering, to include threat
     response, beyond pilot, flight manual, or aircraft limitations is prohibited.
             5.7.1.1. Prerequisites. Mission-qualified pilots (FPL) may receive tactics training and
             certification. Initial qualification pilots will receive tactics certification training during
             Mission Qualification. OG/CC may begin tactics training earlier than mission
             qualification to meet unit requirements.
             5.7.1.2. Certification Training. Complete the Pilot Tactics Certification Training Guide
             for the aircraft type. Initial certification training should be accomplished in the simulator
             to the maximum extent possible.
             5.7.1.3. Certification Documentation. AMC units will document tactics certifications on
             the letter of X’s. Other MAJCOMS will establish their own documentation requirements.
             5.7.1.4. Continuation Flying Requirements. Once qualified, currency requirements may
             be accomplished in the simulator or in the aircraft on a non-interference basis. Emphasis
             is on using the simulator to maintain currency. A separate local training sortie will not be
             generated to accomplish this training. For flying continuation training requirements, see
             Table 4.2
AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010                                                                     47

                          AIRCREW TRAINING SYSTEM (ATS)

6.1. Description. VIPSAM training contractors provide academic, simulator, and technical
training to USAF crews operating commercial derivative aircraft. The Air Force conducts flight
training and evaluations.
   6.1.1. Training is conducted at the contractors Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
   approved training center by FAA certified instructors. Training shall be to the commercial
   Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) Type Rating/Certification standard. USAF difference training
   is conducted in unit.
6.2. Applicability. As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume 1. The ATS is civilian contractor-
provided aircrew training in concert with Air Force instruction. This chapter applies to all
crewmembers attending formal schools using ATS courseware or attending ATS initial, upgrade,
or refresher training. Simulator training contracts govern USAF-contractor relationships and
obligations and may only be modified by the contracting officer. Units will not levy additional
requirements on contractors. Contact the MAJCOM training office with recommended changes
to the aircrew training program.
6.3. Dedicated Training Time. As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
   6.3.1. It is imperative that students complete their training in a timely and uninterrupted
   manner. Students will enroll on a full-time basis and be relieved from duties not directly
   related to training. EXCEPTION: Supervisory personnel may continue their normal duties
   as time permits.
6.4. Course Prerequisites. Each ATS course is designed and based on student prerequisites
being met. Prerequisites may include a minimum number of flying hours, squadron operations
officer recommendation, and completion of applicable training guides. Consult the course
summary document (CSD) or Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) to
determine student entry level for each course.
   6.4.1. FAA Prerequisites. When an ATP Rating Type Certification is allowed under the
   individual contract, the AF student is personally responsible for all FAA prerequisites prior
   to the check ride. The AF will not fund FAA prerequisite training (i.e. training to remove
   center line thrust limitations etc).
6.5. Lesson Objectives.
   6.5.1. Lesson Objective Development. All objectives must meet FAA requirements for
   individual course certification.
   6.5.2. Lesson Objective Description. These are subject to changes in the contract.
   6.5.3. Lesson Objective Use. Instructors and examiners use lesson objectives as a reference
   document to establish training and evaluation standards. Submit recommended changes
   through MAJCOM channels.
 48                                                               AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010


   6.5.4. Contractor Course Material. Training contractors provide student guides, training
   guides, and appropriate course material in the contractor’s commercial format. Each
   commercial course is certified by the FAA to meet commercial training standards.
6.6. COURSE CRITIQUE. Upon completion of training, the contractor shall provide each
student with a copy of AMC Form 246, Student Course Critique. Filling out this critique is
mandatory for USAF students. To receive payment, the contractor must forward the completed
course critique along with the invoice to HQ AMC/A3TA. AMC training managers review
100% of student critiques for training quality assurance.
6.7. Unsatisfactory Student Progress.
   6.7.1. If a student’s training progress is unsatisfactory, the contractor will notify the
   government representative (group training, operations officer, etc.). Following a joint Air
   Force and ATS contractor review of the student’s record, the Air Force will determine
   whether to continue or terminate training.
   6.7.2. The contractor will provide written feedback to the unit commander or training office
   for students who display substandard performance.
   6.7.3. Remediation Procedures. HQ AMC/A3TA or NGB/A3O must receive prompt
   notification from the contractor of failed course completion. Remediation subsequent to a
   failed course may be ATS contractor’s responsibility, Air Force’s responsibility, or a joint
   responsibility, depending on the nature of failure. In every case, close coordination is
   required to achieve maximum trainee progress. Direct contact with appropriate ATS
   instructor supervisor is encouraged.
6.8. Courseware Changes.
   6.8.1. Submit courseware changes through appropriate MAJCOM channels, with
   information copies to HQ AMC/A3T, AFRC/A3T or NGB/A3O.
   6.8.2. Master Task List (MTL) and Evaluation Standards Document (ESD).
      6.8.2.1. MTL/ESD Purpose. The MTL/ESD is required to provide the basis for
      courseware development. The MTL/ESD will be approved by HQ AMC/A3TA and is
      the evaluation criteria for validating an aircrew member’s performance. Flight examiners
      and instructors who evaluate or train crewmembers will use the MTL/ESD to determine
      the ability of an individual to meet the performance levels required to be mission-
      qualified.
      6.8.2.2. MTL/ESD Use. Flight evaluators and instructors in the training and evaluation
      of crewmembers will use the MTL/ESD. Distribution of the MTL/ESD is sufficient to
      ensure that each squadron has reference copies for each crew position. Recommended
      changes will be submitted through Air Force channels using an approved quality
      assurance change proposal (QACP) process. Changes to the MTL/ESD frequently result
      in changes to associated courseware.
6.9. Scheduling. Student scheduling for academic and simulator training classes will be in
accordance with the terms of the individual training contract.
   6.9.1. In the event agreement cannot be reached on scheduling of a class or classes, the
   matter shall be referred to the Contracting Officer for resolution. The contractor shall submit
AFI11-2VIPV1 2 JUNE 2010                                                                     49


   a list of class attendees (to include student name, organization and date of training) to the
   addresses listed below no later than three days prior to class start.
   6.9.2. Training contracts have a specific lead time requirement to either schedule a training
   class or to cancel a scheduled class. Understanding the Contractors cancellation policy is
   critical. Failure to meet a cutoff date could lead to the Government paying for training not
   received. The Government is normally not liable for payment if the late cancellation is due
   to death, injury, illness, or an emergency that requires scheduled training to be cancelled.
6.10. Responsibilities.
   6.10.1. Training Contractor: The Contractor is obligated to comply with the terms of the
   contract. Review the current contract for up to date contractor responsibilities.

                        AIRCREW TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

A2.1. General Information. This attachment provides guidelines on proper training
documentation. Instructions are provided for AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, AF IMT
4023, Aircrew Training Progress Report, AF IMT 4024, Aircrew Training Accomplishment
Report, and AF IMT 4025, Aircrew Summary/Close-Out Report, and aircrew training guides
(TG).
   A2.1.1. Initiate a training folder (electronic or hard copy), AF Form 4022, for the ETCA
   formal training (either at formal school or in-unit), mission qualification, special qualification
   or certification training, in-unit upgrade program to the next higher crew qualification,
   requalification training (either at formal school or in-unit), or for any corrective action or
   additional training. Units may use a government approved Training Management System or
   electronic/hard copy AF 4022, AF 4023, AF 4024, and AF 4025.
      A2.1.1.1. The unit operations officer may waive the training folder requirement if
      corrective action or additional training is limited. If initiated, the instructor or flight
      examiner who evaluated the aircrew member’s performance will enter comments
      pertinent to the training deficiency on AF IMT 4023 or the training guide. Use the
      existing training folder for end-of-course evaluations that result in additional training.
      A2.1.1.2. At the unit commander’s discretion, training folders for an individual
      undergoing more than one training program in a short period of time may be combined
      into one AF Form 4022; e.g., a previous instructor in the MDS upgrading to AC may
      have his or her mission upgrade combined with instructor upgrade in the same folder.
   A2.1.2. Formal schools will send AF Form 4022 with all training records to the trainee’s
   gaining unit. Squadron commanders will review formal school training records and may
   enter appropriate comments on the training guide progress record or AF IMT 4023.
   A2.1.3. Squadrons will maintain the training folders for their personnel in a location readily
   accessible to instructors and supervisory personnel. The trainee may review his or her folder
   at any time.
   A2.1.4. The instructor or trainer will review the training folder, to include AF IMTs 4023
   and 4024 or the training guide, prior to all training periods. Those areas not previously
   accomplished or those, in which crewmembers require additional training, will be noted for
   possible inclusion during the current training period. Operations officers will review active
   training folders quarterly, and flight commanders or squadron training representatives will
   conduct a monthly review. Monthly and quarterly reviews will be annotated on AF IMT
   4023 or in the training guide.
   A2.1.5. Upon completion of training, place the summary/closeout report (AF IMT 4025) in
   the individual’s permanent training folder, as specified in MAJCOM supplement. Squadrons
   will retain all AF Forms 4022 contents for 1 year, and then return them to the aircrew
   member. Do not insert AF Form 4022, AF IMT 4023, 4024, 4025 or training guides into
   FEFs.

   A2.1.6. If training guides are not used; AF IMTs 4023, 4024, and 4025 may be used for ATS
   and formal school courses.
   A2.1.7. The OSS/OST, or equivalent level, may approve unit overprint versions of AF Form
   4022, AF IMTs 4023, 4024, and/or 4025. Comply with AFI 33-360, Volume 2, Forms
   Management Programs. NOTE: AFI 33-360 does not allow altering lines, captions, or
   adding blocks or captions to an existing form as this action is a revision of the original form
   design. This guidance applies to both physical and electronic forms. Insert a statement at the
   bottom of overprinted forms indicating the activity responsible for the overprinted material
   (e.g., 89th AW overprint).
   A2.1.8. For purposes of training documentation, classroom only training conducted at the
   unit should be identified as Academic Training (AT). Ground Training (GT) will be
   considered all training conducted outside the classroom not associated with a flight or
   artificial training device.
