1. Program Description
    1.1. Weapon Safety Program Management. IAW AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention
    Program, the Weapons Safety Program at Osan AB is comprised of two disciplines: explosives and
    missile safety.
       1.1.1. The 51 FW weapons safety office is host and coordinates all weapons safety requirements
       for the base. All tenant units must align their safety programs with the 51 FW weapons safety
       office.
    1.2. General Explosive Safety Standards. Air Force explosive safety standards are in AFMAN
    91-201.
    1.3. Additional Duty Weapons Safety Representative (ADWSR) Appointment. IAW AFI 91-202/
    PACAF Sup 1, Units that handle, maintain, store, install or remove missiles, explosives, chemical or
    nuclear weapons will appoint an ADWSR. Commanders will appoint in writing a primary, in the
    grade of E-5 or above and an alternate, in the grade of E-4 or above and send the letter to 51 FW/SEW.
    This letter, (Attachment 2) must contain individual’s name/rank, office symbol, DEROS, duty phone,
    and email address. Subsequent replacements will be assigned NLT 30 days prior to current ADWSR
    PCS. Individuals selected must have at least nine months retainability and be knowledgeable in the
    mission and activities of the unit and be afforded adequate time and opportunity to perform duties.
    The weapons safety office must train ADWSRs within 30 days of being assigned ADWSR duties.
    1.4. Explosives Safety Program. A comprehensive program developed to actively manage all aspects
    of safety, where all materials under the definition of explosives are involved. Implementation of an
    effective explosives safety program must be equally shared by the wing and tenant units and sup-
    ported by all levels of management, supervision, and operation.
    1.5. Missile Safety Program. Weapons safety program requirements are outlined in AFI 91-202, para.
    10.6. and AFI91-202/PACAFSUP1, para 10.2.6.
       1.5.1. Missile safety is the same as explosive safety in most aspects. However, some additional
       areas of concern must be included in lesson plans and tests. These are as follows:
           1.5.1.1. Procedures for handling Air-to-Air missiles, drop criteria and hazards associated
           with.
           1.5.1.2. Unique handling and transportation problem areas; e.g., trailer turning radius, tie
           down procedures, forklift operations, missile container movement etc.
           1.5.1.3. Using qualified spotters during munitions movements; e.g., loading/unloading stacks
           of missiles/bombs on/off trailers and in/out of storage facilities.
51FWI91-201 23 JUNE 2008                                                                                  3


  1.6. Developing Explosive Operating Instructions. If technical orders or safety briefings cover all
  information listed in AFMAN 91-201, para 2.3 and 2.4, locally developed instructions are not
  required. However, ADWSRs must ensure locally written instructions are completed if applicable and
  signed by commander. These instructions will be maintained at the operating location. Coordinate all
  locally developed instructions through 51 FW/SEW prior to use and annually thereafter. Provide 51
  FW/SEW an electronic copy of all unit OIs.
  1.7. Explosive Facility License. Units requiring storage of ammunition and explosives to support a
  specific explosives operation or mission must obtain approval from the 51 FW weapons safety office.
  The safety office will prepare an example AF Form 2047, Explosive Facility License, IAW AFMAN
  91-201, para 2.35, and the ADWSR will complete the coordination process. The license will require
  unit commander approval and coordination through Security Forces Squadron (Resource Protection),
  Base Civil Engineering Squadron (Fire Department) and Munitions Operations prior to weapons
  safety approving it.
     1.7.1. Licensed storage locations of portable metal box-type (conex) construction located out-
     doors do not require lightning protection. However, licensed locations where unpackaged electri-
     cally initiated explosives (i.e. impulse cartridges) are handled will be equipped with a static bus
     bar to dissipate static electricity. Provide appropriate grounding and bonding in accordance with
     AFI 32-1065, Grounding Systems, Table 1, line 12b.
  1.8. Explosive Safety Training. Host and tenant unit requirements listed AFMAN 91-201, para 2.2
  will be managed by the appointed ADWSR or through a formal course. Additionally, Commanders
  will ensure the following:
     1.8.1. Ensure unit personnel, whose duties involve handling, storage, functioning, transporting, or
     using explosives, are trained and qualified in the tasks performed. Training will be conducted ini-
     tially upon assignment and annually thereafter.
     1.8.2. Ensure unit personnel selected to operate explosives-loaded vehicles/materials handling
     equipment (forklifts, metro vans, K-loaders, flatbeds, etc.) receive explosives training and are
     tested on procedures for transporting explosives.
     1.8.3. Ensure explosives safety training is actively managed and documented.
     1.8.4. Ensure lesson plans/guides are developed by the unit, and are being used to conduct the
     required training. See AFI91-202 and AFI 91-202/PACAFSUP1, Ch 10.
     1.8.5. Provide 51 FW/SEW an electronic copy of all unit explosive lesson plans and tests.
  1.9. Local Purchase of Munitions. Local purchase of commercial explosives or munitions items is
  prohibited unless approved through the Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) program. Contact the
  Munitions Flight (51 MXS/MXMW) for guidance.
  1.10. Military Working Dog Program. Prior to conducting any Military Working Dog explosive train-
  ing operation, K-9 section must contact the weapons safety office. Provisions of AFMAN 91-201,
  para 2.17, DoD 6055.9-STD, para C9.8 and AFJMAN 24-306, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle
  Driver, will be adhered to while conducting these operations.
  1.11. Explosive Movement Routes. All explosives ammunition or other hazardous material trans-
  ported on Osan AB will use established routes. Deviations from established routes must be coordi-
  nated with wing weapons safety office, prior to their use and will avoid all key resources and facilities.
4                                                                         51FWI91-201 23 JUNE 2008


    These routes do not apply to host or tenant munitions custody or consumption accounts or to base
    Security Forces explosives detection dog personnel conducting operational training. However, all
    routes traveled will be direct and will avoid heavily populated or congested base areas as much as pos-
    sible. Except for emergencies, en route stops will not be made. Established movement routes for Osan
    AB are identified on the Base Explosive Map D-8. May be obtained from CE Drafting.
    1.12. Inspection of Incoming Shipments. All incoming explosive loaded vehicles that did not origi-
    nate from Osan AB, will be inspected at vehicle inspection points (J.R Morin gate) prior to further
    movement on base.
       1.12.1. 51 LRS will inspect all commercial and military motor vehicles carrying explosives.
       Exception: Security Forces, 35th Air Defense Artillery (ADA) Brigade Patriot North Battalion,
       and Munitions Flight will perform their own vehicle inspections prior to further movement on
       base.
       1.12.2. These agencies must produce an operating instruction covering transportation procedures
       for both on and off-base. Coordinate operating instructions through wing weapons safety prior to
       implementation.
       1.12.3. The safety office and Fire Emergency Services Flight will be notified of any vehicle found
       or suspected to be in a hazardous condition.
    1.13. Explosives-Loaded Aircraft Parking. Park explosives-loaded aircraft in accordance with AFI
    11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, AFI 21-101/51FW Sup 1, Aerospace
    Equipment Maintenance Management and 51 FWI 13-201, Osan Air Base Airfield Operations
    Instruction.
       1.13.1. Primary parking, loading, and unloading areas for explosive loaded cargo and combat air-
       craft are listed on TAB D-8 of Civil Engineering Comprehensive Base Plan (map) per explosive
       site plans. Explosive site plans are maintained and on file by 51 FW/SEW. A quick reference
       (NEW Chart) is located on the 51FW Wing Safety, Community of Practice (CoP): https://
       afkm.wpafb.af.mil/51FWSafety.
       1.13.2. Flightline area will not be placarded with class/division 1.1, 1.2.x, 1.3, or 1.4 IAW
       AFMAN 91-201, para 2.25.8.8. Weapons expeditors will notify Maintenance Operation Center
       (MOC) who will in turn notify the Fire Alarm Communication Center with; Aircraft tail number,
       parking location, class/division, governing symbol, quantity and type of explosives involved. If
       pre-positioning munitions for exercise or contingencies, notify MOC that munitions are located on
       floor. Emergency procedures will be IAW applicable Technical Order or Checklist.
       1.13.3. Hardened Aircraft Shelter (HAS) door procedures. Net Explosive Weight (NEW) authori-
       zations are valid at all times unless specifically stated otherwise. NEW is based on shelter doors
       remaining closed, except for towing, fueling, servicing, run-up, taxiing, CSOs, and short periods
       to move equipment and munitions. Reference AFMAN 91-201, T3.3., Note 12.
       The following actions constitute servicing;
       • HAS doors may be opened a minimum of 10 feet in conjunction with liquid oxygen or nitrogen
         servicing and weapons loading and unloading.
51FWI91-201 23 JUNE 2008                                                                                5


     • Each leg of Alpha Diamond may be serviced at one time with doors open 10 feet for scheduled
       flyers. When servicing is complete on one leg, HAS doors must be closed before proceeding to
       next leg.
     • When operating aerospace ground equipment on aircraft in HAS.
     • When conducting aircraft maintenance engine runs.
     • When a break in servicing or maintenance should occur, and no individuals are present, the
       doors must be closed within 30 minutes.
     • Upon Pilot arrival for launch of aircraft and notification or aircraft landing.
  1.14. Hung Ordnance and Jammed Gun Procedures. Follow guidance outlined in 51 FWI 21-112, End
  of Runway/Explosive Loaded Aircraft, Hung Ordnance/Gun System Malfunction Procedures, and
  Hung Ordnance/Gun System Malfunction Impoundment.
  1.15. Authorized Munitions Storage Areas. Authorized munitions storage locations are listed on TAB
  D-8 of Civil Engineering Comprehensive Base Plan (map) per explosive site plans. Explosive site
  plans are maintained and on file by 51 FW/SEW. A quick reference (NEW Chart) is located on the
  Safety CoP: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/51FWSafety.
  1.16. Safety Inspections. Safety inspections help identify hazards and measure compliance with
  safety program requirements outlined in AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental
  Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH) Program. Through inspections, the wing safety staff
  helps the commander determine the condition of work areas, the safety of work practices, the degree
  of compliance with safety and health standards, and the degree of compliance with safety program
  requirements. To provide this assistance safety will use outlines as provided in AFI 91-202. The weap-
  ons safety staff will:
     1.16.1. Inspect all explosive locations at least once a year, except as other wise directed.
     1.16.2. Inspect all high-interest areas monthly by spot inspection and annually as part of the
     explosive location inspection.
     1.16.3. Inspect all explosive locations periodically, through spot inspections.
     1.16.4. Inspections will be either "prior-notice" or "no-notice." Inspections will be combined with
     other inspections to reduce the number of inspections a unit receives.
  1.17. Electro-Magnetic Radiation (EMR)
     1.17.1. All cellular telephones and two-way type radios except the Motorola Astros must be sep-
     arated from Electro-Explosive Devices (EEDs) by at least 10 feet when transmitting.
     1.17.2. Motorola Astros must be separated from EEDs by at least 4 inches when transmitting.
     1.17.3. All units deploying to Osan AB that bring their own radios must contact 51 FW/SEW
     prior to using them to have an EMR analysis accomplished by 51 FW/CS.
  1.18. Flak Vest/Chemical Warfare Defense Ensemble (CWDE)/Gore-Tex Wear Policy. Normally,
  clothing materials acceptable for flightline use are acceptable for handling munitions (TA 016). Cot-
  ton or cotton-synthetic blend materials are preferred. Materials of 100 percent polyester, nylon, rayon,
  silk, or wool are highly static producing. Wool socks, glove inserts, and caps as well as undergarments
  of synthetic fabrics are less of a hazard. Nylon garments should not be worn as an outer garment. Gor-
6                                                                              51FWI91-201 23 JUNE 2008


    tex garments may be worn during explosive operations if there are no exposed explosives. Open or
    ruptured rounds constitute exposed explosives. Explosives in the All Up Round (AUR) configuration
    are NOT considered exposed explosives. Personnel, regardless of the type of clothing worn, can col-
    lect a charge of static electricity by being in contact with moving non-conductive substances, or com-
    ing in contact with a mass that has been previously charged. Therefore, personnel must be careful to
    discharge their static electrical potential or equalize it to that of the explosive item before it is handled.
    Particularly avoid directly touching electrical primer.

2. Specific Responsibilities.
    2.1. Unit Commanders. All commanders having a mission or participating in functions involving
    explosives or the transportation of explosives are responsible for implementing a mishap/incident pre-
    vention program. Along with appointment of an ADWSR (See para 2.2.1.), they will:
        2.1.1. Enforce safety standards and all mishap prevention procedures.
