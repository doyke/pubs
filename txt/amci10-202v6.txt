This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-2, Readiness. It establishes
directives and procedures used in reporting and monitoring Mobility Air Force (MAF) missions.
The principle audiences of this instruction are personnel performing mission planning and/or
command and control (C2) duties in the 618th Air Operations Center (618 AOC), AMC
Command Posts (CP), Air Mobility Control Centers (AMCC) and mobile C2 facilities. This
publication applies to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) MAF units and to the Air National
Guard (ANG) only upon mobilization or when operating missions for Air Mobility Command
(AMC), or when operating missions that are flight managed by AMC. This instruction,
specializing in reporting procedures, is associated with other publications governing MAF
operations. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located in Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS).

Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Fixed Command and
Control Operations Branch (AMC/A3OC) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change
of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through Major Command (MAJCOM)
publications/forms managers. This publication may be supplemented at any level, but all
supplements must be routed to AMC/A3OC for coordination prior to certification and approval.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been substantially revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. The name of
this document changed from Mission Reliability Reporting System to Mission Management and
Reliability Reporting System. Events precluding on-time mission execution are titled
“deviations” rather than “delays.” The chapters in this instruction are reorganized to flow from
mission planning, to mission execution, to reporting responsibilities. Additionally, Chapter 3
and Chapter 4 are divided into sections. Chapter 2—En route AMC mission planning ground
times are reduced by 30 minutes (15 minutes for C-130s) for all weapons systems following
velocity initiative data collection results. Chapter 3—Additional aircrew alerting procedures for
C2 personnel are prescribed. Positive alert request procedures are established. Chapter 4—
Deviation reporting instructions for missions departing from a divert location are defined.
Chapter 5—Hard and soft advisories are defined. Commercial aircraft departures in GDSS will
follow the same rules as military. Chapter 6— Controllable deviations are no longer
categorized as unit controllable and headquarters controllable. There are ten deviation categories.
Several deviation codes have been added, deleted, or modified. 400-series deviation codes are
designated as contract carrier controllable deviation codes. Mission Velocity Initiative deviation
codes are established for qualifying missions. Attachment 2 defines deviation code assignment
for Aircrew/Aircraft Tasking System (AATS) overcommitment deviations. It also permits use of
the “505/516” deviation codes only when the contingency/surge rate identified in Table A2.2 is
exceeded.

                                        OVERVIEW

1.1. General. The Mission Management and Reliability Reporting System (MMRRS) is
designed to provide the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), Air Mobility
Command (AMC), other major commands (MAJCOMs), Numbered Air Forces (NAF), and unit
commanders with the information necessary to C2 MAF forces globally. Additionally, MMRRS
can be used to assess (and if necessary make improvements to) the air mobility component of the
Defense Transportation System (DTS). MMRRS is a tool to improve visibility and
accountability of MAF aircraft from the launch sequence, through the air mobility system until
mission completion, as shown in Figure 1.1 Mission deviation identification, documentation,
and subsequent corrective action achieved through MMRRS improves velocity. AMC functional
areas can also use MMRRS data for detailed analysis of their portion of the mission generation
process. MMRRS will not be used as a report card on organizations or individuals.

1.2. MAF C2 System Defined. The term “MAF C2 system(s)” is used repeatedly throughout
this instruction. This term encompasses multiple MAF C2 systems to include AMC‟s primary
mission execution system: Global Decision Support System (GDSS). Where applicable, GDSS
is specifically referenced for data entry requirements. See Attachment 3 for a general list of
MAF Command, Control, Communications and Computer Systems (C4).
   1.2.1. IAW Air Force Policy Directive 10-21, Air Mobility Lead Command Responsibilities,
   AMC, in coordination with other MAJCOMs, establishes C2 processes and in-transit
   visibility of aircraft, cargo, and passengers. MAF C2 system recommendations and

     suggested process improvements will be addressed to HQ AMC/A3RS or the built-in system
     suggestion application (e.g., “Change Request” function in Global Decision Support System
     (GDSS))
1.3. Administration.
     1.3.1. Distribution and Control. Distribution of this volume of AMCI 10-202 is authorized
     for all agencies required to support MAF mission planning, execution, and reporting.
     1.3.2. Waivers. Process waiver requests in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications
     Management Program and/or AFI 10-207, AMC SUP, Command Posts. All waiver requests
     to this instruction will be sent to AMC/A3OC for approval.
1.4. Security. Operations Security (OPSEC), Communications Security (COMSEC), and
Information Security (INFOSEC) are everyone‟s responsibility. Do not discuss classified
information over unsecure communications/computer systems. Follow guidance outlined in the
Operations Order (OPORD), AMC Omnibus, theater Special Instructions (SPINS). HQ
AMC/A3RS is the single point of contact for all requests for data from GDSS from any agency
outside of the Department of Defense. Declassification authority for information within the
classified MAF MAF C2 system is HQ AMC/A3.
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                       9

                                    MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Mission Planning Phase. The mission planning phase starts with a validated air movement
requirement received from USTRANSCOM. Upon receipt of a validated air movement
requirement, 618 AOC will access the requested aircraft type and determine the availability of
the resource. Afterward, a notional mission is created in the C2 system(s) and is refined by
planners at both HQ and unit level until 24 hours prior to initial departure time. Mission
planners at the HQ and unit level are responsible for ensuring one or more (as specified) of the
following areas of the mission planning phase are accomplished:
   2.1.1. MAF Mission Identifier (ID)/Mission Number Creation.
   2.1.2. Mission Symbol Synchronization.
   2.1.3. Mission Requirement and Schedule/Itinerary Creation.
   2.1.4. Diplomatic Clearance Coordination.
   2.1.5. Air Refueling (AR) Event Coordination.
   2.1.6. Crew Assignment.
2.2. MAF Mission ID/Mission Number. The MAF mission ID (also known as mission
number) is a management tool that allows rapid identification of airlift and air refueling missions
necessary to support MAF and the DTS.
   2.2.1. All mission IDs created in MAF C2 systems will be constructed IAW the MAF
   Mission ID Encode/Decode Procedures. The document is maintained by AMC/A3OC. The
   Encode/Decode Procedures outlines the authorized construction of mission IDs in MAF C2
   systems regardless of command or mission type. The document is published electronically
   on the AMC/A3OC Air Force Portal webpage. Contact the OPR, AMC/A3OC, for a copy of
   the document.
2.3. Mission Symbol Synchronization. Mission planners (618 AOC, Current Operations,
Scheduling, Tactics, or a similar responsible agency) will accomplish MAF mission ID and
mission symbol synchronization. Mission symbol synchronization is defined as assigning a
mission symbol to a mission ID at the time of mission planning. This association of a mission
ID to a mission symbol will be checked for accuracy by the flying unit upon termination of the
mission. The mission symbol is comprised of four alpha-numeric characters and is used to
determine the mission purpose, assigned IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and annotated
on AFTO Forms 781-Series. Mission planners will insert the mission symbol in the field
provided in MAF C2 systems. At times, mission symbols may change as mission purpose(s)
may change during execution, e.g., an in-system select of a channel mission to support
Aeromedical Evacuation (AE).            If the mission requires multiple mission symbols,
synchronization is accomplished by specifying in mission planner remarks the sorties between
the airfields where a particular mission symbol applies.
2.4. Mission Requirement and Schedule. Most AMC missions are first planned and allocated
in the Consolidated Air Mobility Planning System (CAMPS) due to its requirement
management, resource tasking, and itinerary planning functionality. Mission schedules created
 10                                                         AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


in CAMPS are then sent to GDSS. Mission schedules detail the planned itinerary and resource
information necessary for C2. AMC mission schedules must be visible in the MAF C2 system as
soon as possible (ASAP), but not later than (NLT) 48 hours prior to execution. Air Mobility
Division (AMD) theater schedules will be visible IAW Air and Space Operations Center (AOC)
Air Tasking Order (ATO) guidelines. Exceptions: Short notice taskings which occur within 48
hours of execution will be entered as soon as known. Office of the Vice Chief of Staff, USAF
(CVAM) Special Air Missions (SAM) will be entered NLT 48-72 hours prior to execution
depending on the level of the user.
   2.4.1. Planners, schedulers, and/or current operations personnel are responsible for making
   required changes to unit-planned, non-training mission schedules and entering them into
   GDSS. They will ensure required diplomatic clearance information and Prior Permission
   Required (PPRs) are requested and entered NLT 24 hours prior to initial departure (12 hours
   prior for training missions).
   2.4.2. 618 AOC will establish an internal process to ensure that PPRs are requested prior to
   mission departure for all 618 AOC-planned missions. Commercial carriers are responsible
   for obtaining their own PPRs unless otherwise coordinated with 618 AOC.
   2.4.3. All missions will contain a “Mission Planner Remark” that includes: the unit
   responsible for planning and the planner‟s name and DSN phone number (e.g., “618
   AOC/EVERETT/779-1234”). If a 618 AOC mission is delegated to a unit-level planner,
   both the 618 AOC planner‟s and unit planner‟s information will be included in the remarks.
   Additionally, when user point of contact (POC) and/or onload POC information is available,
   it will be added to the mission external remarks, or POC tab of the mission detail in GDSS
   for each itinerary stop.
       2.4.3.1. Planners will use the “Notes” tab in the mission details in GDSS to enter
       planning notes that are of interest to aircrew members and C2 personnel.
       2.4.4. “As Required” Missions/Sorties. All mission schedules visible in GDSS are
       subject to deviation reporting, with the exception of “As Required” missions and/or
       sorties. “As Required” missions/sorties are established to retain flexibility when the 14-
       minute departure timing is not as critical as the purpose of the mission. Deviation
       reporting is not required for these missions/sorties. GDSS will not identify/prompt a
       deviation report requirement for each respective “As Required” sortie. The exceptions to
       this rule are Joint Airborne Transportability Training (JA/ATT) missions that position
       from home station to arrive at another location for on-load prior to airdrop. These
       missions are cut with a hard scheduled departure from home station and a hard scheduled
       departure from the off-station location back to home station. The sorties that are
       conducted while the mission is off-station that directly support the JA/ATT will be
       planned with “As Required.”
       2.4.4.1. The only missions/sorties authorized for “As Required” takeoffs are: CVAM,
       training with no external customers (see paragraph 7.3.1.1.2), JA/ATTs, maintenance
       functional check flights, weather evacuations, transfer of assignment, Business Effort,
       and depot input/return missions.
   2.4.5. Recycle Missions. A recycle mission occurs when a mission is planned such that the
   resources are to be assigned to (“recycle to”) a new mission immediately after termination
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                     11


   from its current mission. Both missions are referred to as “Recycle Missions.” Recycle
   missions are planned to maximize resource utilization to meet the needs and requirements of
   multiple users.
       2.4.5.1. Recycle missions must be identified with mission remarks on all affected
       missions by the planning/execution authority. Example: “MISSION WILL FLOW
       FROM AVW01F6D2229 AND RECYCLE TO ABW01G50A234.” Additionally, the
       “Previous Mission” and “Next Mission” fields in the GDSS Mission Detail will reflect
       mission flow. Simply updating the “Previous Mission” and “Next Mission” fields on the
       Mission Detail without adding additional remarks, does not automatically qualify a
       mission to be considered a planned recycle mission for deviation reporting purposes.
2.5. Mission Planning Times. Missions are scheduled with planned ground times dependent
upon mission design series (MDS). Variations in ground times may be scheduled to meet
operational requirements or to allow for known operating limitations (e.g., diplomatic clearance,
operating hours, airfield restrictions, etc.). Ground times will be adjusted IAW the applicable
directives (e.g., AFI 11-2C-2MDSV3, OPORD, CONOPs, etc.) consistent with airfield
restrictions, flow control and other operational considerations. AMC missions supporting JCS
exercises and contingencies will normally use ground times contained in the AMC OMNIBUS
OPLAN.
   2.5.1. Table 2.1 provides a consolidated source of mission timing reported in AFI 11-2MDS-
   Volume 3 as well as divert mission timing established by this instruction.

2.6. Diplomatic Clearances. The 618 AOC International Clearance Branch (618
AOC/XOCZD) is the focal point for aircraft diplomatic clearance information for all missions
managed by AMC and Air Reserve Component (ARC) missions as specified in other
coordinated directives. This does not imply that XOCZD coordinates aircraft clearance for every
AMC mission, rather that the International Clearance Branch is available for technical assistance,
if required. Furthermore, CP/AMCC controllers retain their responsibility to remain cognizant of
diplomatic clearance requirements for missions they are working. Planners and mission
execution personnel will exercise attention to detail using the diplomatic clearance GDSS
application to ensure that any changes do not affect another unit‟s mission. 618 AOC/XOCZD is
 12                                                         AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


the final authority on use and changes to the diplomatic clearance database. Refer to AMCI 11-
208, Airlift/Tanker Operations.
2.7. Air Refueling (AR) Event Coordination. AR data is entered for those missions scheduled
to air refuel. The initial entry of AR data is normally done by Planning/Scheduling/Current
Operations at the same time the mission schedule is initially entered into the MAF C2 system.
Tanker Activity Reports will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-222, Tanker Activity Report.
   2.7.1. When a change in the mission itinerary/schedule causes a change in the AR event, the
   individual making the change is also responsible for revising the GDSS AR Event and
   retransmitting the AR Event.
   2.7.2. When the mission is more than 24 hours prior to execution, the planner is responsible
   for making changes to the AR event data and ensuring complete coordination. When the
   mission is in execution, 618 AOC is responsible for making changes to AR Event and
   ensuring complete coordination. For unit training missions, the tanker unit is responsible for
   all coordination and reflecting the changes in GDSS.
   2.7.3. When a change to an AR event is coordinated between an AMC and a non-AMC unit,
   the AMC unit or the 618 AOC, depending on who is managing the mission, is responsible for
   revising the AR Event.
2.8. Crew Assignment.
   2.8.1. Crew Type Codes.
       2.8.1.1. Aircrew. When a mission is planned or created, this field represents the type of
       crew required. However, once a primary crew is assigned to a mission, this field
       represents the actual complement of the crew assigned (e.g., an augmented crew will
       have an augmented Crew Type Code even if the mission or mission segment does not
       require an augmented crew). This allows C2 at all levels to readily identify the highest
       crew complement should an unforeseen priority need arise. Authorized crew types are
       listed in Table 2.2.
       2.8.1.2. AE Crew. When AE crews are part of the mission, the actual AE crew
       complement assigned to that mission will be entered into GDSS. Authorized AE crews
       are listed in Table 2.2.
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                   13


Table 2.2. Flight Duty Period/Crew Type Codes.
                 Crew Type Code                        Status

                       S               Miscellaneous Support Crews
       2.8.1.3. Deadhead Crews. This term refers to additional crew on board the aircraft not
       actively operating the aircraft or performing crew duties. Deadhead crews are fully
       formed crews or individual crew members that are positioning to complete another
       mission, enter a stage, or are in need of transportation for other official duties. When
       informed that deadhead crew or crewmember needs transportation, the local C2 agency
       will inform their Air Terminal Operations Center (ATOC) of the required number of
       space blocked seats. The crew squadron operations center will place the crew/crew
       member on the mission in GDSS as a deadhead.
       2.8.1.4. The “S” code is to be used for support crews, (e.g., AC/EC-130 Support Crews,
       C-130 Firefighting Crews, etc.).
   2.8.2. Crew Complement.
       2.8.2.1. Aircrew and AE squadron operations personnel are responsible for entering all
       required aircrew and AE crew complement information into GDSS at least 6 hours prior
       to scheduled mission departure. This includes flying, AE, and deadhead aircrews as
       applicable. They are also responsible for the accuracy of that data, to include: Flight
       Authorization (FA), scheduled return time (SRT), aircrew members‟ names, SSAN, etc.
       2.8.2.2. C2 controllers will ensure aircrew data is present and note discrepancies to the
       appropriate squadron or stage who will in turn correct the data in GDSS.
   2.8.3. Scheduled Return Time (SRT) and Firm Scheduled Return Time (FSRT). Unless
   directed differently by AOC/XOB unit current operations will calculate SRTs using the
   mission end time. The SRT is the same as the originally scheduled mission end time and will
   be used for tracking purposes. AMC‟s goal is to return all crews to home station NLT 2
   hours past SRT. FSRT for active duty is defined as SRT plus 48 hours. For non-mobilized
   short term MPA ANG and AFRC crews, FSRT is defined as SRT plus 24 hours.
2.9. Station and Event Purpose Codes. These codes explain the reason a mission is scheduled
to arrive or depart a location and facilitates mission support personnel in identifying
requirements, equipment, and personnel that may need to be prepositioned to support the arrival
of an aircraft. Missions may have different purpose codes for arrival and departure events at a
ground station, but for an air refueling track or drop zone, arrival and departure purpose codes
 14                                                             AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


must be the same. Loading and unloading codes take precedence over ground refueling, or
aircrew change and aircrew rest codes. The exceptions to compliance with Figure 2.3, Station
and Event Purpose Codes, are Air National Guard (ANG) missions due to the unique mission
ID second character. Note: „Y‟ purpose codes in GDSS are assigned when a sortie is cancelled.
Use of this purpose code is not restricted to JA/AAT missions, but can be used when a sortie or
sorties will not be flown.

                                   MISSION EXECUTION

Section 3A—Mission Management/Monitoring and C2 Responsibilities

3.1. Mission Execution Phase. The mission execution phase starts 24 hours prior to initial
departure and ends when the final arrival is entered and the mission is closed.
3.2. Mission Management/Monitoring. Execution of a mission is accomplished by certified
C2 controllers, flight managers, support agencies, and aircrews performing pre-flight, in-flight,
and post-flight coordination, direction, and reporting necessary to ensure successful mission
accomplishment. “Mission Management” and “Mission Monitoring” are terms used only to
identify the difference in scope between the activities involved. At each level, proactive
management is required to ensure successful mission accomplishment.
   3.2.1. Mission management is the function of organizing, planning, directing, and
   controlling MAF airlift and/or tanker missions operating worldwide. Mission management
   includes mission execution authority, the authority to direct where and when a mission goes
   and what it does once it arrives there. AOCs are responsible for mission management. IAW
   AFI 13-1AOC Volume 3, Operational Procedures—Air and Space Operations Center, the
   AOC/AMD mission manages AMD-planned missions. Note: The CP will manage all locally
   executed missions (e.g., training missions, transfer, maintenance functional check flights).
       3.2.1.1. Integrated Flight Management (IFM). IFM has multiple objectives. In short,
       their objectives are to coordinate air mobility mission requirements with the air traffic
       control/management system, assure the safe execution of the mission by flight planning,
       flight filing, proactive flight following, and to act as a resource for aircrews as they
       perform their missions. Flight Managers (FM) will act as the primary link between the
       aircrew and outside C2 agencies as well as the 618 AOC. Sorties that are designated as
       IFM will be identified in the remarks section of GDSS. Flight Managers proactively
       manage the sortie from 6 hours prior to launch to sortie termination. Refer to AFI 11-255
       Volume 3, Integrated Flight Management Responsibilities and Procedures, for in-depth
       IFM procedures.
   3.2.2. Mission monitoring is the function of organizing, planning, limited directing, and
   controlling AMC missions operating from or through a specific location. Mission monitoring
   does not include mission execution authority. CPs, AMCCs, and CRG/CRE/CRTs are
   responsible for Mission Monitoring. CPs, AMCCs, and CRG/CRE/CRTs have no further
   responsibility after the mission departs their location other than performing appropriate
   mission movement reporting. Note: AFRC units follow guidance directed in AFI 10-207,
   Command Posts, AFRC Supplement.
3.3. C2 Scope and Execution Responsibilities. All AMC C2 agencies will comply with
execution and mission movement reporting, and data entry requirements as outlined in this
instruction. Additionally, C2 agencies will comply with mission management/monitoring
responsibilities outlined in AFI 10-207, AMCI 11-208, applicable OPORDs, and CONOPS.
The following paragraphs distinguish the scope of C2 and execution responsibilities at the HQ
 16                                                       AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


and unit-level. Note: ARC C2 agencies will comply with applicable instructions for AFRC-
tasked and NGB-tasked missions.
   3.3.1. 618 AOC/XOC will:
      3.3.1.1. Exercise OPCON over all Prime Nuclear Air Force (PNAF) missions IAW AFI
      11-299, Nuclear Airlift Operations.
      3.3.1.2. Perform C2 functions until inbound aircraft are within UHF/VHF range of an
      AMC fixed C2 location.
      3.3.1.3. Act as executive agent for exercising C2 functions over AMC intertheater and
      CONUS missions, as well as aeromedical airlift missions.
      3.3.1.4. Mission manage all AFRC/ANG aircraft operating AMC missions.
   3.3.2. Air Force Reserve Command Center will monitor/manage all AFRC aircraft assigned
   to AFRC missions worldwide IAW AFI 10-207 AFRC Supplement.
   3.3.3. ANG Command Center will mission manage ANG resources flying on ANG mission
   IDs.
   3.3.4. 316 WG/CP, Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility, will:
      3.3.4.1. Act as the executive agent for exercising control over 89 AW Special Air
      Missions (SAM) scheduled by the White House Military Office (WHMO), CVAM,
      Airlift Operations.
      3.3.4.2. Accept and coordinate requests for airlift only from CVAM.
      3.3.4.3. Coordinate SAM activities to ensure safe and reliable mission accomplishment.
      3.3.4.4. Input all new mission information or changes outside of 89 AW normal business
      hours.
      3.3.4.5. Maintain a communication system to effectively accomplish the above
      requirements. Voice communication and GDSS will be the primary modes to ensure near
      real-time inputs to all concerned agencies and to ensure safety and reliability of the
      worldwide airlift of dignitaries of the United States and foreign governments.
      3.3.4.6. Report real time progress of other than “Close Hold” missions. This entails
      entering mission movement information into GDSS.
      3.3.4.7. Report progress of CVAM “Close Hold” missions by exception directly to 618
      AOC Director of Operations (618 AOC/XOZ).
   3.3.5. CP/AMCC will:
      3.3.5.1. Manage, monitor, and report unit-planned local and off-station trainers (OST).
      Note: ARC OSTs are managed by the originating unit or respective ARC Command
      Center as established in ARC instructions.
      3.3.5.2. Use the GDSS Sequence of Events (SOE) monitor and track local activities
      surrounding mission execution.
      3.3.5.3. Attempt to return missions arriving behind schedule to their published scheduled
      departure time by reducing the planned ground time without violating the minimum
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                   17


      ground times for that MDS. The reduced ground time and new estimated departure time
      (ETD) will be coordinated with 618 AOC.
      3.3.5.4. Advise inbound aircraft of any unsafe conditions and coordinate diversions to
      alternate airfields with 618 AOC.
      3.3.5.5. (Upon request) support Operational Support Airlift (OSA) missions that transit
      their location. Normal support for these missions is usually limited to airfield
      management operations (AMOPS) and transient alert. However, there are instances
      where AMC C2 assistance is requested and will be provided. Support is dependent upon
      conditions at the location and must be prioritized IAW the JCS priority system.

Section 3B—Aircrew and Stage Management

3.4. Aircrew Management. To ensure aircrews are available to support the AMC mission, they
must be managed properly. The following responsibilities apply:
   3.4.1. HQ AMC/A3O will:
      3.4.1.1. Provide staff assistance in the development of operating policies dealing with
      aircrew management, including policies which address stage and reserve crew
      management, additional ground time for crew enhancement, and management of aircrew
      Scheduled Return Time (SRT).
      3.4.1.2. Identify opportunities to use computerized methods for aircrew management and
      coordinate on automated system development and implementation.
   3.4.2. 618 AOC will:
      3.4.2.1. Ensure the mission planning process fosters the efficient use of aircrews.
      3.4.2.2. Collect and present real-time data on aircrews away from home station to
      support efficient aircrew management IAW AMC policies.
      3.4.2.3. Not allow support of short-notice theater requests for JCS priority 2,3,4 Special
      Assignment Airlift Missions (SAAM) with in-system strategic resources when such
      action would require aircrew return beyond their SRT. Strategic resources may be used,
      but only those that are pre-positioned for specific theater support. Priority 1 SAAMs,
      natural disaster relief, emergency air evacuation, and JCS directed requests will continue
      to be supported as required. Exceptions on a case-by-case basis must have 618
      AOC/XOZ approval.
      3.4.2.4. Monitor crew SRT for crews operating AMC missions worldwide. Certain
      factors, such as mission delays and deviations could cause crews to return to home station
      after SRT. 618 AOC/XOZ is the approving authority for crews requesting SRT
      overflight. Once the SRT extension is approved, the circumstances and completed
      coordination should be included as a remark. Do not change the SRT contained in the
      designated field of the GDSS Mission Detail for SRT extensions.
   3.4.3. CP/AMCC controllers will:
      3.4.3.1. Monitor crew SRT for AMC crews operating AMC missions at their location.
      Certain individual or combined deviations will cause crews to return to home station after
 18                                                         AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


       SRT. Crews may request SRT extensions through their owning units. 618 AOC/XOZ is
       the final approving authority. Once the SRT extension is approved, the circumstances
       and completed coordination should be included as a remark. Do not change the SRT
       contained on the GDSS Mission Detail.
       3.4.3.2. Make every effort to return crews on home station aircraft, within the parameters
       of effective mission execution by coordinating with 618 AOC.
   3.4.4. Alerting Procedures. C2 agencies will follow aircrew alerting procedures as outlined
   in AFI 11-2MDS, Volume 3. In addition to those procedures, the following applies:
       3.4.4.1. For 618 AOC-tasked missions, AMC C2 agencies are only required to alert the
       aircraft commanders of the primary/flying aircrew, deadhead aircrew, and (for AE
       operations) Medical Crew Director (MCD). C2 controllers will not alert the remaining
       aircrew members on any of the aforementioned aircrews. Other personnel to include
       DVs, Flight Examiners, and Additional Crew Members (ACM) desiring an alert, must
       coordinate with the controlling C2 agency. When multiple aircrews are operating on a
       mission, the priority for alerting aircrews is as follows: (1) Primary/Flying Aircraft
       Commander; (2) MCD; (3) Deadhead Aircraft Commander; (4) Flight Examiners, DVs,
       and other ACMs.
       3.4.4.2. Except during emergencies or as authorized by AMC/A3, C2 agencies will not
       disturb an aircrew member in crew rest. C2 agencies will not contact crew members
       prior to LFA even for the purpose of resetting the aircrew or releasing them.
       3.4.4.3. In the event that the C2 agent cannot contact the AC, C2 will contact the next
       ranking crew member, proceeding down the FA until a crew member is contacted. C2
       agents will inform the crew member that he/she is accepting the crew alert for the entire
       crew and is responsible for ensuring that the remaining crew members receive the alert.
3.5. AMC Stage Management System. This system is activated by 618 AOC/XOB when
necessary to maximize airlift/air refueling capability IAW AMCPAM 10-210, Stage Crew
Management. Staging aircrews at critical locations minimizes the time aircraft spend on the
ground awaiting rested aircrews. This is a force multiplier providing significantly increased
airlift and air refueling capability. Once activated this system is managed by 618 AOC/XOZ.
   3.5.1. Objective. The objective of the Stage Management System is to provide well-rested
   aircrews with the appropriate Legal for Alert (LFA) time to accomplish the mission. By
   providing accurate reports to HQ, stage managers facilitate effective and efficient airlift and
   air refueling operations.
   3.5.2. Types of Stages:
       3.5.2.1. Directional Stage. A Directional Stage flows in only one direction; e.g.,
       eastbound in which aircrews and missions continue in the same direction.
       3.5.2.2. Bidirectional Stage. A bidirectional stage is one in which the stage aircrews
       flow in two or more directions. This type of stage requires more management and
       decision-making. SRTs will normally establish each aircrew‟s availability for additional
       missions.
       3.5.2.3. Mechanical Stage. Mechanical stages may be established by the CP/AMCC
       where no crews are staged. The stage is created when a mission is delayed or aborted and
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                    19


     the crew goes into crew rest. Mechanically staged crews become first out in the same
     direction when legal for alert. An inbound crew may be bumped from the mission even
     though they have sufficient duty time remaining to complete that mission. Mechanical
     staging of non-mobilized AFRC aircraft/crews requires coordination with HQ
     AFRC/A3O and the operating unit prior to bumping the crew from the aircraft/mission.
     An inbound AFRC crew will not be bumped beyond its FSRT without HQ AFRC
     approval.
  3.5.3. C2 Stage Management Integration. If an AMC C2 capability (fixed or mobile) exists
  at a stage location, the C2 agency is responsible for managing the stage as long as the number
  of stage aircrews provided does not exceed four. However, if the number of stage crews
  exceeds four, HQ AMC/A3MG should deploy the Mobile C2 Aircrew Stage Control unit
  type code (UTC) 7E1AN. This package contains personnel and equipment and can stand
  alone but requires Expeditionary Combat Support.
     3.5.3.1. Each stage location will have a Senior Stage Manager (SSM) and a number of
     duty stage managers. The SSM will contact the senior AMC official at stage locations
     with an existing AMC C2 agency to coordinate facilities and support. At pre-existing
     CP/AMCCs locations (example C-17‟s staged out of Ramstein or Incirlik) supporting
     deployed air expeditionary type squadrons, groups, or wings, the deployed flying
     squadron will provide stage managers.
     3.5.3.2. The stage management workspace should be collocated with but separate from
     the local AMC C2 function (CP, AMCC, CRG/CRE/CRT, etc.) in order to expedite
     information flow.       It is absolutely critical that the activities, functions, and
     responsibilities of the stage manager and the local C2 agency be fully coordinated to
     avoid conflicts and/or duplication of effort.
     3.5.3.3. Stage managers will identify stage crews in their stage and assign crews to
     missions using GDSS. Stage managers are responsible for managing crews and crew
     members assigned to a stage operation. Stage managers will coordinate crew
     assignments and any proposed mission changes with the local C2 agency.
  3.5.4. Mobility Stage Operations Cell (MSOC), also known as the “618 AOC Stage
  Manager,” personnel are sourced by AMC/A3MG. Stage managers will report to 618
  AOC/XOC for administrative support. The MSOC collects aircrew data from location stage
  managers and provides direction for routine aircrew stage management. Final authority for
  operational issues rests with 618 AOC/XOZ.
  3.5.5. Location stage managers sourced by AMC/A3MG report directly to the AMC
  commander at that location, in close coordination with the MSOC. Close coordination
  between location stage managers and local C2 agencies is vital to ensure all operational
  aircrew concerns are addressed and properly managed. It is vital to the success of the
  mission that location stage managers deployed in support of air expeditionary type squadrons
  work very closely with the AMC commander at that location. A memorandum of
  agreement/understanding (MOA/U) should be in place between commanders to help clarify
  this dynamic situation. Regardless, location stage managers are responsible to set aircrews
  LFA, arrange transportation, and brief crews on applicable items. They are responsible for
  all aspects of aircrew related support for the staged aircrews to include recording, compiling,
 20                                                          AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


   and reporting aircrews-relating information to the MSOC in accordance with AMCPAM 10-
   210, Stage Crew Management.
   3.5.6. Stage Crew Priorities. (1)-Emergency return, (2)-SRT, (3)-In stage over 48 hours,
   followed by (4)-First in first out.
   3.5.7. For further information on stage aircrew management procedures and techniques, refer
   to AMCPAM 10-210, Stage Crew Management.

Section 3C—Positive Alert/Launch and Secure Launch Procedures

3.6. Secure Launch Procedures. The secure launch program attempts to minimize exposure of
forces by identifying potential high threat locations/areas and maintaining timely intelligence
information during mission execution. Additional information and C2 procedures for the Secure
Launch Program are outlined in AMCI 11-208. It is imperative that controllers are aware Secure
Launch Program requirements in order to avoid exposing resources to hostile threats.
3.7. Positive Launch Procedures. Positive launch is used by 618 AOC to ensure flow control
and for other management reasons. When implemented, departure station C2 agencies will be
notified of applicable missions. The requirement to provide a positive launch is indicated in the
remarks section of GDSS. C2 agencies will call the 618 AOC/XOCG for alert/launch
coordination and approval one hour prior to aircrew alert at crew rest locations and one hour
prior to departure at en route stops. Aircrews will be prepared to hold in place at flight duty
stations for Positive Launch Approval. 618 AOC/XOZ is the mission launch approval officer.
3.8. Positive Alert Procedures. Positive alert is used by 618 AOC to ensure flow control and
for other management reasons. When implemented, departure stations C2 agencies will contact
the 618 AOC prior to alerting any crew for an AMC mission to confirm mission may depart on
schedule. 618 AOC will coordinate approval for mission to launch on time. 618 AOC/XOCG
will coordinate with the Flight Manager if any leg of the mission is an IFM sortie. C2 agencies
will not alert AMC crews without 618 AOC approval when these procedures have been
implemented.
   3.8.1. Prior to contacting the 618 AOC, the CP/AMCC will input a GDSS Info Remark on
   the departure sortie of the mission stating the following:
       3.8.1.1. Maintenance status of the aircraft, e.g., FMC, PMC.
       3.8.1.2. Legal for Alert (LFA) time of the aircrew.
       3.8.1.3. ETD for which the crew will be alerted.
       3.8.1.4. (For missions immediately proceeding to an AR Track) the tanker unit POC
       confirming the status of the tanker and AR event.
       3.8.1.5. Example positive alert request: “REQUESTING POSITIVE ALERT. LFA:
       265/1000Z, ETD: 265/1415Z, FMC. LTAG TTF POC: KENNEDY”
   3.8.2. After submitting the Info Remark, CP/AMCC controllers will contact 618
   AOC/XOCG to request positive alert.
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                   21


   3.8.3. If positive alert is approved, the 618 AOC/XOCG will input a GDSS Info Remark on
   the departure sortie of the mission stating the approving 618 AOC Duty Officer‟s name.
   Example: “POSITIVE ALERT APPROVED BY MAJ SCOTT”
   3.8.4. If positive alert is denied, the 618 AOC/XOCG will input a GDSS Info Remark on the
   departure sortie of the mission stating the denying 618 AOC Duty Officer‟s name and the
   reason for denial.
   3.8.5. The 618 AOC/XOCG will not place customers on hold during this process. This
   allows CP/AMCC controllers to continue performing other C2 duties. Under no
   circumstance will CP/AMCC controllers assume positive alert is approved without
   notification from 618 AOC. CP/AMCC controllers are responsible for re-initiating this
   process if positive alert is not approved prior to scheduled alert time.

Section 3D—Computer Flight Plan (CFP), Aircrew Departure Papers (ADP), MICAP/VVIP

3.9. Computer Flight Plans (CFP). The following paragraphs supplement CP/AMCC CFP
responsibilities outlined in AMCI 11-208.
   3.9.1. 618 AOC/XOCZF Flight Plans branch will provide multi-leg flight plans for non-IFM
   sorties so that an aircrew has all the flight plans they need to get them to the next AMC
   supported location. To ensure aircrews depart with all required CFPs, controllers will check
   GDSS and retrieve flight plans if there are follow-on sorties transiting non-AMC supported
   locations. For IFM sorties, the C2 controllers may be responsible for downloading the IFM
   aircrew departure papers and providing them to the aircrew. Note: At some locations, the
   unit has elected to delegate this responsibility to another functional area, such as weather,
   AMOPS, stage, squadron, etc.
   3.9.2. Under no circumstance will C2 controllers be responsible for completing/filing
   aircrew flight plans (1801‟s, etc.). While C2 controllers may assist by faxing or e-mailing
   completed forms to applicable agencies the aircraft commander retains responsibility for
   ensuring the completeness, accuracy and proper filing of flight plans.
3.10. Weather Package (Briefing) Requests. When desired, weather packages (briefings) for
AMC missions must be requested in GDSS by the aircrew, AOC Flight Manager, or responsible
agency prior to departure. The responsible agency may retrieve published packages from GDSS.
   3.10.1. IFM Sorties: The 618 AOC Flight Manager will request the package on behalf of the
   crew. Flight Managed missions will have weather published as part of the Aircrew
   Departure Paper (ADP).
   3.10.2. Non-IFM Sorites: Aircrew, planners, schedulers, current operations, C2, or similar
   responsible agency will use GDSS to request a weather package.
3.11. Aircrew Departure Papers (ADP). All CP/AMCC controllers will be proficient in
retrieving ADPs (“IFM Packages”) from GDSS. This does not mandate the CP/AMCC as the
sole agency capable of retrieving and printing ADPs. Units will define a process that ensures
aircrews receive ADPs in a timely manner. Consider existing local mission support activities
(e.g., Prime Knight, One-Stop, etc.) when defining this process.
3.12. Control of AMC Mission Impaired Capability Awaiting Parts (MICAP) and Very,
Very Important Parts (VVIP). Specific responsibilities are outlined in AMCI 23-102,
 22                                                         AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


Expeditious Movement of AMC MICAP/VVIP Assets. 618 AOC/XOCL function coordinates all
requirements to ensure timely movement of AMC MICAP and VVIP and notifies the destination
CP/AMCC that AMC MICAP and/or VVIP parts are inbound. CP/AMCC controllers receiving
information on inbound/outbound AMC MICAP and VVIP items will relay this information via
phone to the ATOC, MOC and/or aircrews, as required. Additionally, CP/AMCC controllers
will review Mission Detail remarks to confirm the presence if MICAP on aircraft transiting their
location.

Section 3E—Deviations During Mission Execution

3.13. Mission Schedule Edit/“Recut. ” At times, 618 AOC will “recut” missions in order to
maximize resource utilization and facilitate the safe and timely delivery of cargo/pax/fuel.
When this occurs, it is necessary to update the mission schedule in the MAF C2 system to ensure
that all affected organizations are updated with revised mission information. Remarks are
mandatory for each mission schedule change. See Chapter 5 for recut data entry requirements.
   3.13.1. Prior to entering execution, the planning agency is responsible for coordinating and
   posting mission schedule changes. During the execution phase, the controlling C2 agency is
   responsible for coordinating and posting any changes to the schedule.
   3.13.2. Units are responsible for making mission schedule changes only to missions created
   at the unit-level. Units may change training missions anytime during planning or execution.
   Ensure coordination with all unit agencies and applicable downline stations is accomplished.
   3.13.3. Headquarters (HQ) missions will only be changed at the HQ level unless the mission
   has been delegated to the unit planner (e.g., CVAM delegates GDSS itinerary changes to 316
   WG/CP and 6 AMW/CP for SAM and Special Air Resource (SPAR) missions, respectively).
   The agency responsible for mission schedule changes will ensure coordination with all
   affected agencies and downline stations is accomplished.
       3.13.3.1. In-System Select (ISS). 618 AOC/XOC, in coordination with applicable
       agencies, and with the Director of Operations (618 AOC/XOZ) approval, may re-direct
       AMC missions to support short-notice, high priority mission tasking such as AE.
   3.13.4. When a user-requested change to a single user mission (SAAM, Exercise, or
   Contingency) is validated and approved, the following procedures will be used:
       3.13.4.1. The mission schedule will be changed if the proposed timing does not cause a
       conflict (follow-on mission, downline restriction, etc.). 618 AOC will resolve conflicts
       with down-line stations and other interested agencies.
       3.13.4.2. If the change cannot be supported, and the mission is still delayed, use the
       appropriate sympathetic deviation code (see Chapter 6). A sympathetic deviation occurs
       as a result of circumstances that cause an aircraft or formation to run in delay e.g., En-
       route Support Team Advanced (ESTA) and/or troop commander chooses to deviate
       without a validated timing change.
       3.13.4.3. Mission schedule changes made as a result of validated and approved user
       requests will include “USEREQ” as the reason for change code in GDSS.
   3.13.5. The authorized reasons for mission schedule changes include, but are not limited to
   the following (all applicable reasons must be coordinated):
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                    23


       3.13.5.1. Onload/offload location of cargo/pax has changed.
       3.13.5.2. A cargo/pax/fuel requirement is added/changed/deleted in the mission
       itinerary/detail. (Note: For single user missions, the deviation will be attributed to the
       user).
       3.13.5.3. The cargo/pax requirement has changed, and this change requires additional
       stop(s) for fuel or other requirements.
       3.13.5.4. Change in positioning/depositioning requirements only (no active mission legs
       from initial on-load to final off-load affected).
       3.13.5.5. Channel mission recuts/edits will be coordinated with the 618 AOC Aerial Port
       Control Center (APCC). APCC will coordinate pax and cargo requirements with all
       affected units.
   3.13.6. Do not recut/edit or change the mission schedule for the following reasons:
       3.13.6.1. To delete an over-flown station.
       3.13.6.2. To hide or mask a deviation. There are many valid reasons for a mission
       schedule change for missions currently running in delay. However, use extreme caution
       during the change process so as not to mask a deviation. Examples of masking a
       deviation are:
          3.13.6.2.1. A quiet hours deviation that was caused by improper mission planning.
          This does not include missions that are already delayed from a previous location and
          are now affected by quiet hours of future arrival locations.
          3.13.6.2.2. Changing a mission itinerary/schedule to more accurately reflect the new
          timing at downline locations is authorized; however, it will not be done if it masks a
          mission deviation at any previous location.
3.14. Air Refueling Delays and Cancellation Procedures. C2 agencies supporting missions
scheduled for an AR event must coordinate and report delays/cancellations ASAP.
   3.14.1. AMC C2 agencies controlling the tanker will notify the receiver unit‟s C2 agency
   and 618 AOC as soon as they are aware a refueling mission will not be able to meet
   scheduled time. Upon contacting 618 AOC, C2 controllers query if the tanker aircrew should
   be alerted on time or delayed (if not already accomplished). 618 AOC/XOCG will
   coordinate with the Flight Manager if any leg of the mission has an IFM sortie. Units will
   submit the required advisory explaining the delay.
   3.14.2. At least 30 minutes prior to alerting the receiver aircrew, AMC C2 agencies
   supporting a mission scheduled to receive fuel will contact the tanker‟s C2 agency and
   confirm the tanker aircraft is mission capable and anticipating an on-time takeoff. If the
   tanker is not on time, en route locations will contact 618 AOC to determine if the receiver
   aircrew should alert on time. If the alert is delayed, units will submit the required advisory
   with remarks explaining the delay.
3.15. Diverts. If an aircraft commander decides to reroute or divert the aircraft, the 618 AOC
must be notified ASAP. 618 AOC is the approval authority for all diverts/reroutes, however, if
an aircraft commander must divert prior to 618 AOC notification/approval, he or she will notify
 24                                                          AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


618 AOC ASAP. All diverts/reroutes will be tracked in the GDSS with the applicable purpose
code. This includes local training missions. Refer to Chapter 5 for divert data entry procedures.
   3.15.1. When a CP/AMCC is the first C2 agency notified of a divert, the 618 AOC/XOCG
   will be notified immediately of the divert to include the divert location and the estimated
   time of arrival (ETA). Additionally, the first notified CP/AMCC will input the divert into
   GDSS.
   3.15.2. When 618 AOC is the first C2 agency notified of a divert, they will immediately
   notify the destination CP/AMCC or, in the absence of AMC C2, AMOPS, operations center
   or similar function. Additionally, the 618 AOC will input the divert in GDSS.
   3.15.3. When a C2 agency directs a mission to fly to an alternate airfield, the agency will
   ensure conditions at the alternate airfield are suitable for the directed action. That is, the C2
   agency will ensure the aircraft/aircrew can comply with existing weather conditions,
   NOTAMs, and airfield suitability information before directing the alternate landing site.
   3.15.4. Maintenance Divert. A maintenance divert is a diversion or air abort from the
   schedule due to an aircraft system malfunction. The purpose code used to indicate a
   maintenance divert is “J”. A maintenance divert occurs as an air abort when an aircraft
   system malfunction prohibits the aircraft from continuing to its next scheduled destination.
   A maintenance divert can also occur while the aircraft is on the ground and it must be flown
   to a different location other than the next scheduled location for repairs. Because this is not
   normally a planned event, a 2-hour crew/maintenance troubleshooting and repair ground time
   is authorized for the location providing the service. If the aircraft cannot be repaired within 2
   hours, the crew is normally entered into crew rest and scheduled to depart based on the
   authorized maintenance divert ground time. If the crew is able to complete the next sortie
   within their crew duty time, they do not have to enter crew rest. In this case they must
   consider troubleshooting/repair time.
   3.15.5. Non-Maintenance Divert. A non-maintenance divert is a diversion or air abort from
   the schedule for non-mechanical reasons and not related to a user‟s validated onload/offload
   of cargo/pax. The purpose code used to indicate a non-maintenance divert is “K”. If the
   mission cannot proceed within the crew duty time, the crew is normally entered into crew
   rest and scheduled to depart based on the authorized non-maintenance divert ground time. If
   the crew is able to complete the next sortie within their crew duty time, they will not have to
   enter crew rest.

Section 3F—Early Termination, Cancellation, and Closure

3.16. Early Termination. Early termination occurs when a mission is on the ground at a station
after the originating location, but will not continue on the planned itinerary. These missions
have actual times reported. The mission will go into review (“REV”) status and the crew and
aircraft will be automatically de-assigned. All other mission data will remain. A mission can be
resumed, if needed. If not, then the mission must be closed IAW para 3.17.
3.17. Mission Cancellation. A mission cancellation can only occur when a mission does not
depart from the originating station for any reason. Missions that have no actual departure or
arrival times may be cancelled at any time. GDSS will keep these cancelled missions in the
database for 96 hours. Within the 96 hour window the missions can be reinstated. After 96
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                    25


hours the mission will be purged from the active GDSS mission database and be archived for
historical purposes in AHS. Missions that have no actual times reported and are greater than 48
hours past their initial scheduled time of departure will be automatically changed to “Cancelled”
but can be reinstated up to 144 hours after their initial scheduled time of departure. After 144
hours, the missions will automatically be purged from the active GDSS mission database and be
archived for historical purposes in AHS.
3.18. Missions in Review and Closures. After the final actual time in blocks (ATB-in) is
entered into GDSS, the mission status changes to “REV” meaning “review status” if all
mandatory data is already input for all sorties. All missions must be closed (“CLO”) in GDSS
within 8 hours of mission termination to decrease database clutter and enhance system
performance. A mission may remain open indefinitely if a 555 deviation is unresolved.
Missions departing from a location with fixed AMC C2 with a 555 assigned, will automatically
convert to a 255 at 48 hours after entry. For all other locations, the 555 will convert to 501.
   3.18.1. For AMC missions terminating at AMC locations, the unit C2 controllers will review
   the mission and ensure all mission data is entered into GDSS (i.e., all actual times are
   entered, delayed departures have deviation information, and all 500-series delays have a
   control number and validated by the 618 AOC delay controller, etc.). After verifying all data
   is entered, the C2 controller will “close” the mission.
       3.18.1.1. The 316 WG/CP and 6 AMW/CP will close all missions assigned to their units,
       regardless of the termination location.
   3.18.2. For AMC missions terminating at locations without AMC C2 presence, 618 AOC
   will review the mission and ensure all mission data is entered in GDSS (i.e., all actual times
   are entered, delayed departures have deviation information, and all 500-series delays have a
   control number and validated by the 618 AOC delay controller, etc.). After verifying all data
   is entered, 618 AOC will “close” the mission. The responsibility for closing Strategic Arms
   Reduction Treaty (START) missions is reserved for 618 AOC/XOCG. C2 Controllers can
   identify a START mission by reviewing the Mission Planner Remarks section of the GDSS
   Mission Detail.
   3.18.3. All other non-AMC units are responsible for ensuring all missions under their control
   are closed regardless of location of termination.
   3.18.4. AMD C2 controllers will ensure all AMD-managed missions are closed at
   termination regardless of termination point. AMD will direct unit level mission monitors at
   mission termination locations with C2 capabilities to close their missions and at termination
   locations without C2 capabilities AMD mission managers will close missions.
3.19. Mission Deletion. Deleting a mission is final and permanently deletes all mission records.
A mission cannot be retrieved once deleted. With few exceptions, only mission planners should
delete missions, not mission execution/C2 personnel. Missions with actual times will not be
deleted.

                                           Chapter 4

               MISSION MOVEMENT REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES

4.1. General. The purpose of this chapter is to establish responsibilities for major functional
areas involved in the mission movement reporting process. Personnel using GDSS must report
timely and accurate mission information, as specified in Chapter 5. AMC C2 personnel will be
trained to operate GDSS IAW AMC Master Training Plan (MTP) and local directives, as
applicable.
4.2. Headquarters’ Responsibilities.
   4.2.1. AMC/A3OC will:
       4.2.1.1. Enforce Mission Management and Reliability Reporting System (MMRRS)
       policy and procedures.
       4.2.1.2. Assist AMC/A3RS, AMC/A3MG, and AMC/A3DI and MAF C2 system
       Program/Functional Managers in defining policy and procedures, validating existing C2
       system requirements, and developing new requirements as C2 systems must evolve to
       meet mission requirements.
       4.2.1.3. Arbitrate disputed deviation code assignments as described below:
          4.2.1.3.1. Arbitration. Arbitration is not intended to resolve internal unit-level (e.g.,
          Aerial Port versus Maintenance Group) disagreements in deviation code assignment.
          Rather, formal arbitration is required when POCs at the unit (to include transiting
          aircrews) and HQ level cannot come to a consensus on deviation code assignment.
          AMC unit commanders will designate a single representative as the unit POC for
          arbitration issues.
          4.2.1.3.2. Requesting Arbitration. A notification (telephonic or e-mail) sent by the
          unit, aircraft commander, or 618 AOC to AMC/A3OC with mission ID, assigned
          deviation code, name(s) of personnel contacted (at 618 AOC or unit), and the
          proposed deviation code. AMC/A3OC will arbitrate and assign a deviation code
          based upon all official records containing mission information including but not
          limited to: GDSS data, Logbook, remarks on CP/AMCC Aircrew Management and
          Mission Monitoring forms, commercial carrier contracts, CP Events Logs, and voice
          data files from recorded telecommunications systems. For aircrew arbitration
          requests, the aircraft commander‟s comments will suffice. After thorough research
          and analysis of the mission, AMC/A3OC will assign a deviation code and enter it into
          GDSS with the applicable remarks. Arbitration decisions and deviation code
          assignments are final. Note: AMC/A3OC is not required to obtain a control number
          for assignment of a 500-series deviation code.
   4.2.2. 618 AOC/XOCG will:
       4.2.2.1. Exercise day-to-day oversight of MMRRS.          This oversight is delegated by
       AMC/A3, Director of Operations.
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                   27


       4.2.2.2. Ensure MAF C2 system users report accurate and timely data. Note: 618 AOC
       personnel will not change information without coordination and approval by the
       applicable unit(s).
       4.2.2.3. Enter timely and accurate information for all AMC missions and AMC-gained
       resources operating AMC missions that transit locations without an AMC C2 agency, to
       include BUSINESS EFFORT missions.
       4.2.2.4. Accomplish all required coordination and GDSS updates for 618 AOC-directed
       or validated mission deviations. This also applies to ANG assets. However, prior
       coordination with the NGB/A3X, Staff Duty Officer (SDO) is mandatory. The SDO is
       available 24-hours daily and can be reached at DSN (312) 858-6001 or commercial
       phone number (301) 981-6001.
   4.2.3. Air Mobility Division (AMD). C2 controllers at AMDs will manage and coordinate
   the execution of all strategic air mobility operations supporting the AOR. Mission
   monitoring will facilitate centralized control of strategic resources. AMD controllers will
   adjust and coordinate the interface of 618 AOC-scheduled air mobility operations based on
   the current theater situation. The AMD is responsible for entering and correcting all mission
   data and closing missions within the C2 systems.
4.3. Unit-Level Responsibilities. The overall responsibility for correct and timely reporting at
locations with AMC forces rests with the AMC unit commander.
   4.3.1. CP/AMCC/CRG/CRE/CRT will:
       4.3.1.1. Report timely and accurate mission information for all MAF missions transiting
       their location. Note: For training missions, missions with a priority 2C1 and lower, CPs
       will submit mission movement data received from aircraft commanders transiting
       locations without AMC fixed C2.
           4.3.1.1.1. AMC deployed forces including Tanker Task Force (TTF), Contingency
           Response Group (CRG), CRE/CRT, and Expeditionary Air Refueling Units, are
           responsible for entering all mission movement data directly into GDSS when no
           AMC C2 exists at the deployed location.
              4.3.1.1.1.1. For locations with both an AMC C2 presence and TTF, the AMC C2
              agency will coordinate closely with TTF personnel to gather information in order
              to update the GDSS with required mission movement data. The primary
              responsibility for reporting this information rests with the AMC C2 agency.
           4.3.1.1.2. Mission movement reporting for USAFE and PACAF assigned aircraft
           flying Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) missions operating on AMC
           mission IDs is accomplished through CPs/AMCCs to 618 AOC. After launch of a
           mission from an en route station, that station‟s CP/AMCC normally has no further
           responsibility for mission execution other than performing the appropriate mission
           movement reporting.
       4.3.1.2. Ensure required pre-departure data is visible in GDSS by the appropriate
       agencies at their location (reference AFI 10-207 for “Originating Mission Setups”).
       Changes to resource status must be reported in GDSS and/or telephonically to 618
       AOC/XOCG (for AMC missions).
28                                                         AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


     4.3.1.3. Ensure required mission movement data (arrival, departure, deviation, advisory,
     remarks, etc.) are entered into GDSS as specified in this instruction by the appropriate
     agencies at their location.
     4.3.1.4. Ensure all post-mission activities are accomplished at locations where the
     mission terminates. C2 controllers will make every attempt to contact crews to retrieve
     missing data in GDSS (i.e., deviations, arrival/departure times) and will coordinate with
     618 AOC for data entry of the missing information. For training missions, the home unit
     is responsible for entering and correcting all mission data.
     4.3.1.5. Query aircrews of any OPREP-3 reportable activity occurring during the mission
     that was not previously reported by another C2 agency.
  4.3.2. Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) controllers (or comparable maintenance
  control agency) coordinate execution of the flying and maintenance schedule in accordance
  with AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management. MOC controllers will
  coordinate with the appropriate agencies if a mission does not have a properly assigned tail
  number in GDSS within 6 hours of scheduled departure time. C2 controllers will obtain the
  following information from MOC for MMRRS data:
     4.3.2.1. Work Unit Code (WUC) for the first five positions of the deviation remarks.
     4.3.2.2. A description of the maintenance discrepancy and corrective action.
     4.3.2.3. Actual times of completion for monitored SOE events for which MX is the OPR
     (e.g., fuel upload complete, engine start time, etc.).
     4.3.2.4. Estimated Time in Commission (ETIC) for aircraft that are not mission capable.
     4.3.2.5. ETA of MICAP and Maintenance Recovery Teams (MRT)/Personnel.
  4.3.3. Air Terminal Operations Center (ATOC) controllers or comparable air terminal
  operations personnel are responsible for ensuring all planned and actual cargo and passenger
  information is entered into the MAF C2 system, whether it is entered in GATES or GDSS.
  Planned cargo data and passenger data will be entered NLT 6 hours prior to scheduled
  departure time. Actual cargo and passenger data will be entered into GATES or GDSS as
  soon as it is known, but NLT than 30 minutes after departure. ATOC controllers are
  responsible for providing all required transportation information when mission deviations are
  attributable to transportation operations. C2 personnel will obtain actual times of completion
  for monitored SOE events for which TR (transportation) is the OPR (e.g., cargo upload
  start/complete, pax onload start/complete, etc.).
  4.3.4. ARC Reporting Responsibilities.
     4.3.4.1. AMC-gained forces on non-AMC missions at CONUS locations without an
     AMC C2 presence will report to their home unit. ARC forces performing non-AMC
     missions who are unable to report through parent command C2 agencies may contact the
     618 AOC with the appropriate data. If the mission is OCONUS, the AC may contact the
     AMC C2 agency at his/her location or the 618 AOC with mission movement data
     regardless of mission type. AMC-gained aircrews on IFM missions will report mission
     data to their assigned Flight Manager IAW AFI 11-255V3.
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                29


      4.3.4.2. ANG aircraft commanders on non-TWCF and non-Operations and Maintenance
      (O&M) ANG missions will contact ANG Command Center with flight-following
      information.
4.4. Special Mission Reporting Procedures. The 316 WG/CP (on behalf of the 89 AW) and 6
AMW/CP report for SAM/SPAR missions scheduled by the Office of the Vice Chief of Staff
(CVAM), USAF. Only the 316 WG/CP is permitted to enter SAM mission movement
information into C2 systems. Only the 6 AMW/CP is permitted to enter SPAR mission
movement information into the C2 systems.
4.5. Exceptions to Reporting Mission Movement in MAF C2 Systems. Reporting exceptions
will be granted on a case-by-case basis only after approval by the unit‟s MAJCOM. MAJCOMs
will coordinate all exceptions with AMC/A3OC.
   4.5.1. Voice Reporting. When access to GDSS is interrupted or the system is not available,
   units will voice report mission movement and resource information to the 618 AOC. AMC
   crews will call the 618 AOC when transiting locations without AMC C2 facilities (AMC
   CP/AMCC/CRE). AMC crews on IFM missions will report to their assigned Flight Manager
   when transiting locations without AMC C2 facilities. 618 AOC/XOCG will update the MAF
   C2 system as needed, and notify all AOC mission execution agencies (e.g., APCC, XOCL,
   XOZ, SIDO, etc.) of the system interruption.
   4.5.2. Units will submit voice reports on all JCS priority “1A” missions (i.e., PHOENIX
   BANNER/SILVER/COPPER, PNAF, etc.) IAW AMCI 11-208. This voice report is
   required in addition to reporting in GDSS.

                                           Chapter 5

                               DATA ENTRY PROCEDURES

5.1. General. This chapter provides information and data entry criteria for mission and resource
management, and movement reporting in GDSS. Enter all arrivals, departures, deviations,
advisories, resource assignment, resource status change, and other related mission and resource
data ASAP, but NLT the times specified below. GDSS User Manuals provide operating
procedures for data entry. All MAF C2 system users will use the procedures outlined in the
applicable manuals. GDSS user manuals and checklists are available on the GDSS Support Site
at URL https://gdss2support.scott.af.mil/.
5.2. Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS). Since the
increase in ACARS-equipped aircraft and the introduction of GDSS, use of ACARS to populate
times is common. C2 controllers must ensure that all auto-populated times are accurate. C2
controllers have the ability to view all times and override ACARS-generated date/time inputs
when the ACARS message is determined to be in error. As GDSS functionality, privileges and
reports become available, AMC C2 controllers will use ACARS as the primary means of
communication for official messages when the aircraft is not within UHV/VHF range.

Section 5A—Arrivals, Advisories, Remarks and Departures

5.3. Arrivals. Data must be entered ASAP, but NLT 15 minutes after the aircraft has blocked-
in. The goal is to input the arrival information within 5 minutes of block-in. The block-in
time is normally received from a maintenance controller or may be automatically populated in
GDSS based on an (ACARS) “On” or “In” message. This time is used to calculate Deviation
Start Time (DST).
   5.3.1. Block-in Times: The reportable block-in time is the time the aircraft comes to a stop
   at the designated gate or parking spot.
   5.3.2. Arrival Double Block-in. If an aircraft must “double-block,” thus having a different
   initial and final block in time, the reportable time is the initial block in time. The extra time
   required for double blocking will be taken into account during mission scheduling. If
   additional time is necessary and the departure is delayed, the deviation will be attributed to
   the planner (if insufficient ground was allotted) or responsible agency (if sufficient time was
   allotted by the planner).
5.4. Advisories. Advisories are entered into GDSS to inform all stations of any possible
deviations or other pertinent information concerning a mission. Examples are to adjust the
mission‟s ETD, alert HQ and down-line stations of possible deviation, etc. When applicable, the
advisory will contain the new projected ETD. All advisories will contain remarks explaining the
change in departure time.
   5.4.1. Advisory Remarks. Mandatory remarks must provide as much information as
   possible and be entered ASAP prior to departure. Reasons for entering advisories include,
   but are not limited to:
       5.4.1.1. Mission will deviate in timing from the latest published itinerary.
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                      31


       5.4.1.2. Conditions become known that may or will cause the mission to depart more
       than 30 minutes early or late (20 minutes for AFCENT AOR missions). This includes
       known maintenance or loading problems.
   5.4.2. A voice report to 618 AOC/XOCG, or flight manager (if applicable) is required prior
   to submitting an advisory that changes the ETD or ETA on AMC Channel, SAAM, Exercise,
   or Contingency missions or anytime the mission has an air refueling event occurring on the
   sortie after departure from the current location. Include initials of the 618 AOC/XOCG C2
   controller or Flight Manager that the voice report was given to with the applicable remarks
   explaining the deviation.
   5.4.3. A voice report to applicable C2 agencies is required prior to 618 AOC submitting an
   advisory that changes the ETD or ETA on AMC Channel, SAAM, Exercise or Contingency
   missions or anytime the mission has an air refueling event occurring on the sortie after
   departure from the current location. Include the initials of the C2 controller that the voice
   report was given with the applicable remarks explaining the deviation.
   5.4.4. Hard advisory times. Use a hard advisory time for a mandatory take-off time event
   (quiet hours at that station or down range, receiver time change, etc.) to ensure that estimated
   timing calculations reflect what should happen. Any changes in estimated times prior to the
   "hard" advisory will calculate normally for each itinerary location until it reaches the "hard"
   advisory. From the hard advisory point and any downline locations, the automatic
   calculations will use the hard advisory time. If the situation changes, the hard advisory time
   may be changed to a soft time. If a mission is recut, all advisory times are automatically
   converted to soft times. Only the 618 AOC is authorized to use the Hard Advisory for AMC-
   tasked missions. Unit C2 controllers may input a hard advisory for AMC-tasked missions
   provided coordination is accomplished with the 618 AOC/XOCG. Example: A mission has
   the following itinerary KCHS-ETAR-ORBD-OKBK. While at KCHS it becomes known that
   ETAR has an unscheduled closure during the time the mission was scheduled to depart from
   ETAR. The 618 AOC will input a hard advisory at ETAR to reflect the revised departure
   time based on the airfield reopening. The hard advisory will update the ETA at ORBD and
   OKBK. However, soft times entered at KCHS will not change the hard time at ETAR.
   5.4.5. Soft advisory times. Select a soft advisory time when time is not the driving factor of
   the advisory but the remarks are. When the soft time is used, subsequent estimated times are
   updated at all downline times through system recalculations.
5.5. Remarks. Include information of interest to C2, aerial port, maintenance, and other
mission support personnel as well as applicable downline stations. Provide as much information
as possible without using ambiguous or location specific acronyms. Do not use remarks in place
of an advisory when a departure time requires adjustments.
   5.5.1. Mission Schedule Cancel/Edit/Recut Remarks. When recutting a mission, as a
   minimum, the following information must be entered in the remarks:
       5.5.1.1. The original mission ID assigned before the mission was recut (if the recut
       drives a mission ID change).
       5.5.1.2. An explanation of why the mission was recut. Include the original International
       Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code sequence in the remarks as well. Example:
 32                                                            AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


       “Mission was recut from EGUN-KPIT-KCHS to EGUN-KDOV-KPIT-KCHS to pick up
       MICAP parts at KDOV.”
       5.5.1.3. Any associated (linked) tanker or receiver mission IDs must also be identified in
       the remarks.
5.6. Departures. Data must be entered ASAP, but no later than 15 minutes after the aircraft has
departed. The goal is to input the departure information within 5 minutes of departure.
   5.6.1. GDSS will not permit a departure to be reported unless previous event(s) have actual
   times reported, i.e., units will not be able to enter a departure event unless all previous
   departure and arrival events have been entered into the system. GDSS will also document a
   departure based on ACARS “Out” and “Off” messages.
   5.6.2. If a sortie flight time is less than 1 hour, the departure station will call the next station
   with the ETA. However, this does not relieve the departure station from entering a departure
   time into GDSS.
   5.6.3. Update the ETA to the next location based on the Total Time (TT) as generated on the
   Computer Flight Plan or as provided by the Flight Manager/Planner or AMOPS personnel.
   Accurate ETA is extremely important to the down-line station to ready their resources.
   5.6.4. Mission schedules/details must contain the aircrew complement information, aircrew
   SRT, station purpose code and aircraft tail number for departure data to be entered.
   5.6.5. Departure Double Block-out. To compensate for double blocking on departure, the
   aircrew LFA may be adjusted to provide additional time from aircrew “show time” to
   departure (but not reduced to less than the minimum required ground time). When the
   authorized ground time does not allow for this adjustment, deviation reporting procedures
   will be conducted IAW this instruction.
   5.6.6. Commercial Aircraft Departures. GDSS is now configured to accept commercial
   aircraft ATB-out and Actual Time of Departure (ATD) in the same manner as military
   aircraft.

Section 5B—Deviation Reporting

5.7. Deviations. Deviations must be entered ASAP, but no later than 2 hours after the
aircraft has departed. C2 controllers must coordinate deviation code information with
applicable responsible agencies such as maintenance, host base, 618 AOC, etc. Specifically, C2
controllers are responsible for gathering facts, selecting and entering the proper deviation
information and entering deviations remarks into GDSS.
   5.7.1. Military Missions. Deviation remarks are required when a military aircraft departs
   (launches) 15 minutes or more after the scheduled departure or DST.
   5.7.2. Commercial Missions. Deviation remarks are required when a commercial aircraft
   departs (launches) 1 minute or more after the scheduled departure or DST. Commercial
   carrier mission-timing is computed from block-in to block-out. Deviations are computed
   from block-out time versus ATD.
       5.7.2.1. Commercial aircraft are contracted to block-out 20 minutes before the scheduled
       departure time (the time posted in GDSS). Units should adjust their SOEs accordingly.
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                    33


  5.7.3. AMC installations. The overall responsibility for correct and timely deviation
  reporting rests with the unit commander. Unit commanders will establish local processes and
  designate a Mission Deviation Manager in the CP/AMCC to review/validate all assigned
  deviation information within 24 hours after mission departure time or before mission
  termination, whichever occurs first. After this time, if a change is recommended, the Mission
  Deviation Manager will contact applicable agencies to reconcile the disputed deviation and,
  if needed, assign a new deviation code. If the information is entered in error, and
  coordinated with affected OPRs, the Mission Deviation Manager will update GDSS.
     5.7.3.1. The Mission Deviation Manager will review/validate deviation information if
     the circumstances directly involve 618 AOC and, if required, AMC/A3OC arbitration.
     The Deviation Manager and 618 AOC/XOCG are expected to find a fair and equitable
     solution without arbitration. However, AMC/A3OC has final deviation arbitration
     authority for all disputed deviations.
     5.7.3.2. If required, AMC units will conduct detailed deviation cause analysis and
     institute process changes that will assist in correcting systemic problems. Chapter 6
     designates HQ AMC OPRs that are responsible for analysis of each deviation code and
     identifying possible problematic trends.
     5.7.3.3. The Mission Deviation will be completely familiar with the contents of this
     instruction.
  5.7.4. Non-AMC installations. The overall responsibility for correct and timely deviation
  reporting on AMC missions rests with the 618 AOC/XOCG C2 controllers. Deviation
  codes/remarks can be changed at the discretion of the C2 controller utilizing applicable
  mission deviation facts.
  5.7.5. Deviation Reporting for Diverts. Deviation code assignment is required upon
  departure from any divert location. The primary deviation code for all diverts will be
  attributed to the cause of the divert regardless of the amount of time incurred by the cause as
  missions automatically incur delays when they deviate from the published itinerary.
  Reporting the cause enables HQ to capture why missions divert rather than capturing the
  factor that incurred the most delay time.
     5.7.5.1. If the mission does not exceed DST, an “L” prefix and code will be entered. The
     deviation code will reflect the event that caused the diversion. The delay time will be
     “0.0.” Example: A C-5 diverts to ETAR due to thunderstorms at EGUN. The mission
     departs ETAR prior to DST. The deviation code will be reflected as “L-103.” The delay
     time will be equal to 0.0.
     5.7.5.2. If the mission exceeds the DST due to the same event causing the divert, then
     subsequent delay beyond the DST will be reflected as an “X” prefix and deviation code.
     The delay time will start at the DST and end when the aircraft departs. Example: A C-5
     diverts due to a landing gear discrepancy. The aircraft departs two hours later than the
     DST due to the landing gear write-up. The primary deviation code will be “X-913.” The
     delay time will equal 2.0.
     5.7.5.3. There will be times when an aircraft becomes further delayed by additional
     issues other than the incident that caused the divert. An additional issue will be reported
     as a secondary deviation.
 34                                                         AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


5.8. Deviation Remarks Data Elements. All deviations will contain a prefix, deviation code,
deviation time, and remarks. This information provides clarification on the reasons why a
mission was delayed. The remarks should expand upon and clarify the deviation code
description--do not repeat the deviation code description in the remarks.
   5.8.1. Deviation calculation for military missions. A deviation occurs when a mission
   departs a station 15 minutes or more past the DST. DST is calculated by adding the
   scheduled ground time to the actual block-in time. Scheduled ground time is the difference
   between scheduled arrival time and scheduled departure time. For originating missions and
   missions arriving on time or early, the DST time is the same as the scheduled departure time.
   The deviation time is the difference between the DST and the ATD. DST is not an editable
   field in GDSS.
   5.8.2. Deviation calculations for commercial missions. A deviation occurs when a mission
   blocks out one minute or more past the DST or scheduled departure time for originating
   missions.
5.9. Deviation Prefix. A prefix of “X‟ or “L” defines the type of deviation.
   5.9.1. “X” Prefix: Deviations for military aircraft missions will use this prefix when the
   ATD EXCEEDS the DST by 15 minutes or more. Deviations for commercial aircraft
   missions will use this prefix when the actual time of block-out (ATB-out) EXCEEDS the
   Deviation Start Time by one minute or more.
   5.9.2. “L” Prefix: Use this prefix when the mission DOES NOT EXCEED the Deviation
   Start Time, but does depart 15 minutes or more after its scheduled departure time. Remarks
   are required and must be comprehensive enough to explain the deviation in detail, e.g., “L-
   913: Previous deviation at KDOV for maintenance and EGUN for OPS hours”; “L-106:
   aircraft divert due to weather below minimums at PAED.” The remark “Previous station
   delay” does not meet the requirements for this field.
       5.9.2.1. Recycle missions. Controllers will use an “L” prefix for a mission that departs
       after the scheduled departure time, but does not exceed the authorized ground time
       between the two missions. Calculate the authorized ground time by computing the
       difference between the previous missions scheduled arrival and the originating missions
       scheduled departure time. The computed time should be equal to or greater than the
       standard authorized ground time for the type of aircraft flying the mission. C2 controllers
       will use a deviation code that reflects why the previous mission ran in delay. Normally
       this deviation code will be the last “X” deviation entered on the previous mission.
       Deviation remarks will include the previous mission ID that was running late. If the time
       is less than standard ground time for the applicable MDS, assign the applicable planning
       error deviation code.
           5.9.2.1.1. Exception: C2 controllers will assign an “X” prefix instead of an “L”
           prefix for recycle missions when the late departure is caused by something in addition
           to the late arrival from a previous mission. There will be times when an aircraft
           arrives late from a previous mission and then becomes further delayed by additional
           issues. In this situation, the primary code would carry an “X” prefix with a deviation
           code identifying the primary reason the mission departed late. The secondary
           deviation code will be the previous mission‟s primary deviation code assigned to the
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                      35


           mission on its last sortie. The secondary deviation code time will be the total time
           attributed to the mission arriving late (i.e., amount of time the mission arrived late).
           Previous mission ID and appropriate remarks explaining why the aircraft arrived late
           from the previous mission are required in the deviation remarks. This is in addition to
           the mandatory remarks for the assigned primary deviation code.
           5.9.2.1.2. If the previous mission does not have a delay code due to a recut,
           controllers can find the appropriate delay by reviewing the advisory from the first
           sortie of the recycled mission and/or the recut remark found in the previous mission
           detail.
5.10. Deviation Codes. Each functional area has a series of deviation codes available to
identify reasons for deviation. Deviation codes are detailed in Chapter 6.
   5.10.1. The primary deviation code is the first event in the sequence of events that directly
   leads (meaning an event from which unit actions cannot recover) to the mission departing in
   delay. C2 controllers will consider the 14-minute take-off window when evaluating
   “recoverable” events.
5.11. Deviation Times. This time is used to show the duration of the deviation when the
primary prefix is “X”. Deviation time is reported in tenths of an hour. If multiple circumstances
caused the deviation, report the total deviation time in the primary reason time field and report
the total time attributed to the secondary deviation in the secondary reason time field. A
Deviation time is not required when the deviation prefix is “L”. Enter “0.0” in the primary
reason time field.

                 15-20        .3      40-45       .7
5.12. Deviation Remarks. Fully explain primary, secondary, and subsequent reasons for
deviation WITHOUT repeating the deviation code meaning or being cryptic. The importance of
complete and understandable remarks cannot be overemphasized. After creating remarks,
controllers will ensure the remark comprehensively illustrates why the mission was delayed
before transmitting the deviation remarks. The goal is to be able to review the remark and obtain
a clear understanding of why the mission deviated from the scheduled itinerary. If there is still
doubt as to where to categorize the deviation, contact 618 AOC/XOCG C2 controllers or
AMC/A3OC for assistance.
5.13. Changing a Deviation Code.
   5.6.1. Unit-level change: Units can only correct a deviation code assigned by their station.
   Corrections must be made within 24 hours or prior to mission termination or closure. After
   mission closure the unit must contact AMC/A3OC to request the deviation code be changed.
36                                                    AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


  An e-mail will suffice. In turn, AMC/A3OC will update the deviation and (if applicable)
  subsequent “L” deviations that were assigned based on the old deviation.
  5.6.2. AMC/A3OC, 618 AOC/XOCG, or other C2 agencies will not change deviation codes
  entered into the MAF C2 system without coordinating with the original C2 agency that
  entered the code.
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                    37


                                           Chapter 6

                                    DEVIATION CODES

6.1. Deviation Codes. Deviation codes are divided into ten separate categories: Miscellaneous,
Operations, Air Transportation, Contract Carrier, HQ, Other MAJCOM, Supply, Logistics (LG)
Saturation, Aircraft Maintenance, and Mission Velocity. These categories are established based
on the content of all codes within and identifies the responsible HQ directorate OPR.
   6.1.1. Deviation codes are identified as controllable or uncontrollable.

Section 6A—Controllable and Uncontrollable Deviations Explained

6.2. Controllable Deviations. Controllable deviations are attributed to processes of the
accountable agency has direct influence over during all mission phases. Processes or actions that
can be successfully planned around by either HQ or the unit with a reasonable chance for success
are controllable, e.g., airfield operating hours not considered or en route flying times
miscalculated.
   6.2.1. Controllable deviations are identified based on the framework and capabilities of the
   majority of AMC installations and AMC processes. It is understood that not every
   installation has the same degree of control over every deviation identified as controllable.
   Such exceptions should also be considered when examining departure reliability percentages
   for a particular location. For example an AMS may not have the same level of control to
   prevent/resolve a 913 deviation (landing gear discrepancy) compared to the level of control a
   main operating base (MOB) might have over the same problem. Consideration of such
   exceptions for each location is vital, especially if one were to compare departure reliability
   percentages from one location to another location.
   6.2.2. The purpose of recording controllable deviations is to take steps to improve processes
   in for future operations. Decisions on identifying the proper deviation code should be based
   on actual events. Deviation code assignment should not be influenced by concern over unit
   departure reliability rates, quarterly goals, or personal gain such as EPR bullets.
   6.2.3. A low departure reliability rate at a location does not imply negative performance or
   poor management at that location. It is understood that each location has unique
   circumstances such as mission, aircraft, manning, parts, facilities, workload, etc. Units are
   encouraged to highlight and address factors associated with long term frequent instances of
   controllable deviations to HQ in order to improve processes in the future. Such
   improvements may include adjustments in manning, facilities, logistics or supplies.
6.3. Uncontrollable Deviation. Uncontrollable deviations are attributed to processes that are
outside of AMC‟s control and cannot be planned around. Uncontrollable deviations are listed in
Table 6.1 and Table 6.2.

Section 6B—Deviation Code Categories

6.4. Miscellaneous Deviation Codes. This section outlines reporting instructions and deviation
codes for functional areas not defined in other deviation code categories. Detailed non-cryptic
 38                                                          AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


concise remarks are especially important when using 100-series deviation codes.            Ensure
remarks clearly describe the situation.
   6.4.1. Weather. Use a weather related code when deviations are attributed to weather
   conditions at a departure, en route, or arrival location.
   6.4.2. Events and Incidents. Use the applicable code when deviations are attributed to
   hostile and non-hostile events or incidents.
   6.4.3. Miscellaneous Support Agencies. Use the applicable code when deviations are
   attributed to agencies not belonging to operations, transportation, or maintenance under the
   objective wing concept.
   6.4.4. Airfields and Air Traffic Control. Use the applicable code when deviations are
   attributed to airfield and/or airspace restrictions. For these codes, Maximum on Ground
   (MOG) is refers to an aircraft parking saturation, not a manpower saturation to
   service/process aircraft.
   6.4.5. Single User Missions. Use the applicable code when deviations are attributed to user
   changes or failure to complete required actions that impact a mission departure. Delayed
   missions appropriately coded as “user-accountable” deviations include SAAMs, JCS exercise
   or contingency missions, JA/ATTs, OSAs, and Executive Airlift/SAMs. Only use these
   deviation codes if it is fully determined that AMC units provided all necessary information
   and support to the user.
   6.4.6. Other. Use 199 when there is no OTHER miscellaneous deviation code that describes
   the deviation. Use this delay sparingly. A Miscellaneous deviation code will only be
   assigned after a thorough review of the existing codes reveal a code does not exist for the
   situation that resulted in a deviation. Units are highly encouraged to contact AMC/A3OC for
   assistance prior to assigning 199, 299, 399, 499, 799, 899, and 999-deviation codes. Detailed
   remarks are required anytime these codes are used.

            matches the deviation situation.
6.5. Operations Deviation Codes. This section outlines Operations-specific deviation reporting
instructions and deviation codes. Use a 200-series deviation code when a missions deviates due
to operations.
   6.5.1. Aircrew Deviations. Use the applicable code when deviations are attributed to
   aircrew. Units assigning aircrew deviations will advise the aircrew, when practical,
   explaining sequence of events and logic used in reaching the decision. If the aircrew disputes
   the deviation, they should contact their home unit upon mission termination or if possible,
   earlier.
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                     41


      6.5.1.1. Use the 222-deviation code when a crew directs maintenance and no discrepancy
      is found or if maintenance personnel cannot duplicate the discrepancy. Any maintenance
      action beyond an ops check disqualifies use of this deviation code. If maintenance
      performs any fix, even a simple fix (e.g., circuit breaker reset) the 222 is not the proper
      code.
      6.5.1.2. Also, use this code when the crew delayed departure to have maintenance repair
      a discrepancy that is a mission contributing (MC) part according to the Minimum
      Equipment List (MEL), which is not currently essential to safe mission continuation.
      Also, use this code if the crew delayed departure to request a waiver for a maintenance
      discrepancy that is a MC part according to the MEL.
          6.5.1.2.1. There are times when the Mission Essential Subsystem List (MESL), used
          by maintenance, and the Minimum Equipment List (MEL), used by aircrew, reflects
          incongruities between what is and what is not mission essential. When maintenance
          is performed on a system that is mission capable according to the MESL, and mission
          essential according to MEL, the CP/AMCC will assign an X-555 then defer the
          deviation to maintenance and operations leadership for arbitration.
   6.5.2. Management and coordination. Use the applicable code when deviations are
   attributed to management, C2, and/or coordination.
   6.5.3. Unit Planning. Use the applicable code when deviations are attributed to unit
   planning. Do not use these codes for 618 AOC and AOC/AMD planned-missions.
   6.5.4. Aeromedical Evacuation Medical Support. Use the applicable code when deviations
   are attributed to patient movement/medical support.
   6.5.5. Other. Use 299 when there is no OTHER Operations deviation code that describes the
   deviation. Use this delay sparingly.

6.6. Air Transportation Deviation Codes. This section outlines mission deviation codes
specific to air transportation functions. Use a 300-series deviation code when a mission deviates
due to air transportation functions such as transportation management, passenger service, air
freight, or fleet service. Ensure remarks clearly describe the situation. Air Transportation
deviations, are for use at any AMC, non-AMC, commercial, or military location. These
deviation codes identify a specific air transportation processes or events, which may or may not
be accomplished by AMC personnel.
   6.6.1. Air Transportation Management. Use the applicable code when deviations are
   attributed to transportation management. See code 265/525 for deviations that occur in the
   interest of improving mission utilization (e.g., deviation to accommodate priority
   contingency cargo/pax).
   6.6.2. Passenger Service.     Use the applicable code when deviations are attributed to
   passenger service.
   6.6.3. Air Freight. Use the applicable code when deviations are attributed to Air Freight
   functions.
   6.6.4. Fleet Service. Use the applicable code when deviations are attributed to fleet service
   functions such as aircraft servicing of latrine, trash removal etc.
   6.6.5. Other. Use 399 when there is no OTHER Mission Support deviation code that
   describes the deviation. Use this delay sparingly.

6.7. Contract Carrier Deviation Codes. Commercial Deviation codes are required when a
commercial aircraft blocks out one minute or more past after the scheduled departure time.
   6.7.1. This section outlines Contract Carrier-specific reporting instructions and deviation
   codes. Use the applicable code when an aircraft deviates due to operations controlled by the
   contract carrier. Include explanatory information in the remarks.
   6.7.2. Contract Carrier. These codes will only be used for commercial contracted carrier
   missions, NOT for organic (military) aircraft. Use the applicable code between 408 and 499
   when deviations are attributed to the commercial aircraft contractor. These codes are

   especially critical due to contract penalties for excessive deviations. If an AMC unit or
   other military entity causes the deviation, do not use these deviation codes.

6.8. Higher Headquarters Deviation Codes. This section outlines reporting instructions and
deviation codes when 618 AOC or AOC/AMD is the primary responsible agency, or when
another MAJCOM directs a mission to deviate. Use a 500-series deviation code when mission
deviations are attributable to 618 AOC or AOC AMD, or use the applicable 600-series deviation
code when an aircraft deviates due to direction by a MAJCOM other than AMC. Include
explanatory information in the deviation remarks. See Attachment 2 for instructions on
reporting Aircrew/Aircraft Tasking System (AATS) commitment level deviations.
   6.8.1. 618 AOC and AOC/AMD Deviation Codes. As the controlling authority over mission
   execution (except training missions), AOCs may direct or approve mission modifications or
   deviations. AMD directed mission modifications would also use the 500-series deviation
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                   47


  codes. Note: ARC units will not use 500-series deviation codes unless the unit is flying an
  AMC mission.
     6.8.1.1. Control Log. In order to assign 500-series code to an AMC mission, either as a
     primary or a secondary, AMC units must receive a control number from 618
     AOC/XOCG. 618 AOC/XOCG will maintain a control log of all 500-series deviation
     codes (AOC/AMDs may maintain control logs at their discretion). After an AMC unit
     determines a 500-series may apply, the unit will contact the 618 AOC/XOCG to confirm
     accurate use of the code and review the verbiage. The 618 AOC/DDO will review
     deviation code remarks to ensure they match the deviation reason and are suitable for
     senior leadership review. Once approved, a control number will be issued and the unit
     will input the deviation into GDSS. Note: The only 500-series deviation codes that do
     not require a control number are the 501, 555.
         6.8.1.1.1. If the review results in a need to modify the suggested code or the
         verbiage, the individual at the unit will make the agreed upon changes. If the unit and
         618 AOC/XOCG are unable to come to a consensus, a 555-deviation code will be
         assigned to the mission. The 618 AOC/XOCG or unit will request arbitration IAW
         Chapter 4.
         6.8.1.1.2. The 618 AOC or AMD control number            is only valid for the single
         departure sortie for which it was issued. The 618       AOC (or AOC/AMD, when
         applicable) must issue a subsequent control number       for any other 618 AOC (or
         AOC/AMD) approved deviations. Include the 618           AOC or AOC/AMD control
         number in the deviation remarks.
     6.8.1.2. Execution Deviations. Use the applicable code between 501 and 509 when
     deviations are attributed during the execution phase.
     6.8.1.3. Planning Deviations. Use the applicable code between 510 and 517 when
     deviations are attributed to planning.
     6.8.1.4. Management Deviations. Use the applicable code between 523 and 555 when
     deviations are for management purposes. See Attachment 2 for instructions on reporting
     Aircrew/Aircraft Tasking System (AATS) commitment level deviations.
     6.8.1.5. Other. Use 599 when there is no OTHER deviation code that describes the
     deviation.
  6.8.2. Temporary Deviation Code. A 555-deviation code is used as a temporary placeholder
  for unresolved deviations. Deviations must be reported within 2 hours after an aircraft
  departs. However, if the reason for deviation is not resolved within 2 hours, use an X-555
  deviation code and in the remarks section designate a unit POC, organization, DSN,
  estimated completion time for deviation resolution, and the reason the deviation is still
  unresolved. Send updated deviation information as soon as the deviation reason is resolved,
  but NLT mission termination or 24 hours after the actual departure time--whichever time
  occurs later.
     6.8.2.1. MAF C2 system users other than those managing AMC missions, will attempt to
     resolve all 555-deviation codes within 48 hours of actual departure. If unable to resolve
     the deviation code, the MAJCOM or HQ with day-to-day oversight of the mission will
48                                                        AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


     enter the corresponding MAJCOM deviation code from Table 6.22. Example: a 555-
     deviation code assigned to a AFCENT intra-theater C-130 mission with an “F” as the first
     character of the mission ID will be updated with the following: “X-670: AMD unable to
     resolve reason for deviation” as missions are not authorized to be closed with a 555-
     deviation code assigned.
        6.8.2.1.1. 618 AOC/XOCG C2 controllers will attempt to resolve all 555-deviation
        codes within 24 hours after actual departure from non-AMC stations or stations
        without an AMCC, for AMC managed missions. If unable to resolve the deviation
        code within that 24-hour period, they will enter a subsequent 555-deviation code with
        remarks stating reason why they were unable to resolve.
        6.8.2.1.2. After the initial 24 hour period, but before 48 hours from departure (24 to
        48 hours total after departure) 618 AOC/XOCG C2 lead controller will enter a
        subsequent 555-deviation code stating reason why they were unable to resolve the
        deviation. Missions are not authorized to be closed with a 555-deviation code
        assigned.
     6.8.2.2. 48 hours after unresolved deviations the following will occur:
        6.8.2.2.1. Departures from locations with AMC fixed C2 presence (CP/AMCC). If
        the deviation code is not resolved within 48 hours, GDSS will automatically update
        the C2 system by changing the 555 to a 255 with the following deviation remark:
        “Unit unable to resolve reason for deviation.” The deviation code will remain 255 if
        not changed by unit C2 personnel. Units may request AMC/A3OC to change
        deviation codes on missions that C2 controllers cannot access via their MAF C2
        systems. Missions are authorized to be closed with a 255-deviation code assigned.
        6.8.2.2.2. AMC mission departures from locations without AMC C2 presence. If the
        deviation code is not resolved within 48 hours, GDSS will automatically update the
        C2 system by changing the 555 to a 501 with the following deviation remark: “618
        AOC/XOCG unable to resolve reason for deviation”. The deviation code will remain
        a 501 if not changed by 618 AOC/XOCG C2 controllers. Missions are authorized to
        be closed with a 501-deviation code assigned. A 501-deviation code will only be
        used for AMC managed missions with an AMC specific mission ID.
  6.8.3. Other MAJCOM (Non-AMC) Deviation Codes. This section outlines reporting
  instructions for HQ other than AMC. These deviation codes have been established for
  administrative purposes and only apply to non-AMC missions. AOC/AMD will use the
  600-series codes to identify higher HQ directed deviations for each theater.
     6.8.3.1. Primary Deviation. When the primary deviation is attributable to a MAJCOM,
     use the appropriate 600-series code.
     6.8.3.2. Secondary Deviation. A secondary deviation will be entered with appropriate
     remarks. For example, if PACAF directs a mission to deviate by two hours to improve
     utilization, and subsequently deviates one hour for maintenance reasons, the primary
     deviation code will be 610 with a time of 2.0. The secondary deviation code will be a
     9XX with a time of 1.0. Remarks will include an explanation for both of the deviation
     codes.

6.9. Logistics Deviation Codes. This section outlines logistic-specific reporting instructions
and deviation codes. Use the applicable 700-series deviation code when an aircraft deviates for
parts. Use the applicable 800-series deviation code when an aircraft deviates due to saturation or
shortage of logistics facilities, personnel. Use the applicable 900-series deviation code when an
aircraft‟s deviation is due to maintenance problems. Include explanatory information in the
remarks section.
   6.9.1. Departure Deviations for Supply. Use the applicable code between 711 and 799 when
   an aircraft deviations for parts. Review paragraph 6.10.4.3 when determining if deviation
   should be coded as supply or maintenance. Note: Whenever a 700-series deviation code is
   the primary reason for a deviation, the appropriate 900-series deviation code will be entered
   in the secondary deviation code field and the appropriate Work Unit Code (WUC) entered as
   the first five characters in the remarks. Do not precede the WUC with the letters “WUC”.
         6.9.1.1. All supply deviations require a WUC and stock number or part number in the
         first part of the remarks section. This part number or stock number will be used to
         analyze the availability of parts associated with deviations. Also, include the actual time
         the part(s) was ordered in remarks.
         6.9.1.2. If the responsible supply function is not an AMC unit and either did not issue a
         part or did not issue the part in time for an on-time takeoff, use the appropriate 100-series
         deviation code and explain in remarks. Again, it is mandatory to include the WUC, in the
         first 5 characters in the remarks followed by the stock number, part number, and reason
         in the remarks.
         6.9.1.3. Other. Use 799 when there is no OTHER Logistics Supply deviation code that
         describes the deviation. Use this delay sparingly.
   6.9.2. Departure Deviations for Logistics Saturation or Shortage. Use the applicable code
   between 831 and 899 when the deviation is for saturation or shortage of logistics facilities,
   logistics personnel, etc.

   6.9.3. Other. Use 899 when there is no OTHER logistics saturation deviation code that
   describes the deviation. Use this delay sparingly.

            category matches the deviation situation.
   6.9.4. Departure Deviation Codes for Maintenance. Use the applicable 900-series deviation
   code when an aircraft‟s deviation is due to maintenance problems.
        6.9.4.1. All maintenance and supply deviations require a WUC as the first five characters
        in the remarks section when applicable. C-17 aircraft will use the complete reference
        designator code. The last two digits of the 900-series deviation code are usually the same
        as the first two digits of the WUC. Include explanatory information of the component or
        system that caused the deviation and a brief description of the corrective action taken. If
        the original aircraft is replaced with another aircraft, also enter the original aircraft tail
        number (aircraft that had the system problem). When an aircraft is replaced (“tail
        swapped”) due to a mechanical issue, the corrective action is the tail swap. The WUC
        represents the system that malfunctioned, regardless of the location or the personnel
        performing the corrective action.
        6.9.4.2. Minimum notification time for HQ AMC directed support of MICAP and MRT.
        Use the following minimum time standards (Table 6.27) to compute the notification cut-
        off time prior to scheduled departure. Choose one of the “Basic Items.” Then add to the
        time all the “Additive Activities” that apply. (Example: hand-carried part requires bench
        check: hand-carried time, 2 hours; plus bench check time, 4 hours; equals total minimum
        notification time, 6 hours.):

        6.9.4.3. Assigning Supply or Maintenance Deviation Code. Use an appropriate 700-
        series supply deviation code if the deviation would not have occurred had the part been
        on hand. If the deviation would have occurred even if the part had been available, use a
        900-series maintenance deviation code as the primary deviation and a 700-series as the
        secondary deviation reason.
        6.9.4.4. Assigning Maintenance or Quiet Hours (140) Deviation Code. Use the 140-
        deviation indicator if the deviation would not have occurred had an engine run taken
        place during published quiet hours. If the deviation would have occurred even if the
        quiet hours were not a factor, use a 900-series maintenance deviation code as the primary
        deviation and 140 as the secondary deviation reason.
        6.9.4.5. Other. Use 999 when there is no OTHER logistics deviation code that describes
        the deviation. Use this delay sparingly.

            deviation occurs as a result of a Wing MXG or MSG process. Use 500 deviation

6.10. Mission Velocity Initiative (MVI) Deviation Codes. Mission velocity initiative
deviation codes highlight certain deviations occurring on missions participating in a HQ-directed
reduced ground time initiative.
   6.10.1. Assign the appropriate mission velocity code when all of the following conditions
   exist:
        6.10.1.1. A mission is participating in a HQ-directed initiative that aims to increase
        mission velocity through reduced ground times. Note: Initiatives will be announced by
        the implementing authority in a HQ-generated message. These codes do not apply to unit-
        directed velocity initiatives.
        6.10.1.2. Only if the mission would have departed within DST if the initiative‟s reduced
        ground time was not a factor. The following situation illustrates a scenario when these
        delay codes would apply: The minimum authorized quick-turn ground time for a C-5 is
        3+45. However, the mission is participating in a velocity initiative that directs 3+15 on
        the ground. This mission is authorized a mission velocity code if it departs prior to 3+45
        on the ground. It is not authorized one of these codes for any delays occurring beyond
        3+45 on the ground.
   6.10.2. Mission velocity deviation codes are only authorized for use as a primary deviation.
   A corresponding secondary delay amplifying the reason for the deviation must be used is also
   required. The following example illustrates proper mission velocity code assignment: A
   mission velocity participating C-5 is scheduled for 3+15 on the ground and departs 3+35
   after arrival. The reason for delay is cargo loading time exceeded. The primary delay code
   would be X-398 and the secondary delay would be X-340 for load time exceeded. Delay
   verbiage must amplify the reason for the deviation.
   6.10.3. Mission velocity deviation codes are not authorized to be used with an “L” prefix or
   for recycle missions.

                                  MISSION RELIABILITY

7.1. General. The Mission Reliability Program measures operational effectiveness by tracking
mission departure delays at AMC CONUS, and AMC en route locations. Commander-to-
commander dialogue throughout the chain of command is essential. Although deviations are
identified at one command level, some changes may necessitate coordination or action at other
command levels due to the interrelated nature of the air mobility system.
   7.1.1. Mission reliability analyzes data by aircraft type and location. The program only
   measures AMC missions at/or transiting through AMC locations. AMC-gained aircraft are
   only included in this analysis when flying AMC missions (as indicated by mission ID) at/or
   transiting through AMC locations.
   7.1.2. MAF aircraft that are not operating on AMC missions are not included in mission
   reliability analysis. In addition, AMC aircraft transiting non-AMC locations and Change of
   Operational Control (CHOPd) aircraft are not included in mission reliability analysis. Lastly,
   mission reliability analysis is conducted by location not by unit; consequently, multiple units
   staged from one location cannot be differentiated.
7.2. Mission Reliability Analysis. Mission reliability analysis is used at both HQ AMC and
unit level to identify and correct negative trends. The HQ AMC staff uses mission reliability
data to analyze aircraft systems performance, evaluate business rules, and review functional-
level processes. Local commanders will use mission reliability data to assess internal processes
which affect their station‟s ability/inability to produce on-time mission departures.
   7.2.1. HQ AMC Directors will establish procedures and designate division level OPRs to
   monitor mission reliability data integrity periodically throughout the month. Division OPRs
   will work with unit level OPRs to correct problems and elevate, as required, for problem
   resolution.
   7.2.2. Unit commanders will establish written procedures and designate representatives to
   review/validate mission reliability information on a monthly basis using the following five-
   step process:

Table 7.1. Five-Step Mission Reliability Performance Process.
           Detect a change in reliability using the Deviation Accountability Rate (DAR)
      1.
           formula.
      2.   Analyze the data to identify causal factors for the changes.
           Document factors impacting reliability and develop a course of action to improve
      3.
           departure reliability.
      4.   Implement changes for improving reliability.
           Return to Step #1 to assess the effectiveness of implemented changes; adjust as
      5.
           necessary, and identify new factors affecting mission reliability.
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                     59


   7.2.3. The AMC Data Warehouse (ADW) is the official data source for mission reliability
   analysis. The Reports Information Database Library (RIDL), an application within GDSS, is
   used to acquire ADW data used for trend analysis.
   7.2.4. Unit-level deviation analysis and downloads of AHS mission reliability data are
   available through the RIDL reports. A GDSS username and password is required to access
   RIDL. For assistance contact the GDSS Help Desk at DSN 576-4949 or refer to the GDSS
   Reports          Library         Web          User      Manual         at          url:
   https://gdss2support.scott.af.mil/index.jsp?c1=25.
7.3. Mission Reliability Formulas. The HQ AMC staff uses two mission reliability formulas;
Departure Reliability (DR) and Deviation Accountability Rate (DAR), to calculate, analyze, and
brief AMC leadership on a single unit, multiple units, and/or the command‟s mission reliability.
These formulas are the command standard.
   7.3.1. Departure Reliability (DR). DR measures total “on-time” departure rates by location
   regardless of cause. Note: On time refers to the standard for departures contained within AFI
   11-2XX, Volume 3, Flying Operations series—those missions departing within 14 minutes
   of the DST. The command baseline for DR is 80%. DR provides HQ AMC staff personnel
   with macro-level trend analysis information and helps identify potential failure points in the
   mission generation process. DR measures many factors that cannot be solved at the unit
   level; consequently, local commanders will not use the DR formula to assess their
   ability/inability to produce on-time mission departures.
       7.3.1.1. DR is calculated as the number of on-time takeoffs divided by the total
       departures for qualifying missions multiplied by 100. The final figure is expressed as a
       percentage. Example: 36 deviations out of 240 total departures; DR equals 85%. The
       following are qualifying missions:
           7.3.1.1.1. All 618 AOC-tasked missions.
           7.3.1.1.2. All training missions meeting the following criteria:
              7.3.1.1.2.1. Off station trainers (OST) with “E” as the 2nd character of the mission
              ID.
              7.3.1.1.2.2. Local trainers with a “U” as the 2nd character performing air refueling
              training sorties as a receiver and/or tanker.

Figure 7.1. Departure Reliability (DR) Formula.



   7.3.2. Deviation Accountability Rate (DAR). DAR measures delayed departures by location
   using only accountable deviations in the formula. Accountable deviations are categorized by
   agency. DAR provides unit-level commanders the percentage that DR would increase if
   those deviations did not happen. Example: 6 out of 36 deviations are attributed to passenger
   service, DAR for passenger service deviations equate to the following: 6 (passenger service
   deviations) / 240 (total departures) = 2.5%.

Terms
AATS.—Aircrew/Aircraft Tracking System is a tasking tool that takes into account limitations
imposed by aircrew and aircraft availability.
Additional Crew Member (ACM). Aircrew members not required for a particular mission
being flown, but who are required for follow—on missions. See AMCI 11-208 for additional
details.
Aeromedical Evacuation (AE). AE system provides fixed—wing movement of patients
requiring supervision by AE Crewmembers (AECM‟s) to locations offering appropriate levels of
medical care.
Aeromedical Evacuation Control Team (AECT).—The AECT is the central source of
expertise for aeromedical evacuation. This team is responsible for operational planning,
scheduling, and execution of scheduled and unscheduled AE missions through the appropriate
AE elements. The AECT monitors execution of AE missions and coordinates and communicates
with theater planning cells and AE elements. The AECT advises and briefs the DIRMOBFOR
on AE issues.
Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF).—An organization comprised of aerospace capabilities
that provides tailored force packages to meet theater combatant commander‟s needs across the
full spectrum of military operations. AEFs are inherently capable of performing one or more of
the Air Force‟s basic functions: counter air, counter space, counter land, counter sea, strategic
attack, counter information, command and control, airlift, air refueling, space lift, space support,
special operations employment, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and combat search
and rescue. The fundamental underpinning to the sustained execution of these functions is the
Air Force‟s ability to provide the full complement of Expeditionary Combat Support forces.
Airborne Report (AIREP). A report made by an aircraft while airborne concerning
position, weather, and aircraft data. It is used for recording in—flight weather and position
reports primarily when flying on over-water missions.
Airlift Control Team (ALCT). The ALCT is the source of intra—theater expertise within the
AMD. The ALCT brings intra-theater airlift functional expertise from the theater organizations
to plan and coordinate intra-theater airlift operations in the AOR/JOA for the JFACC.
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                     67


TRANSCOM/AMC may augment the ALCT with intra-theater airlift expertise. These two
sources of airlift expertise integrate into a single ALCT within the AMD.
Air Mobility Control Center (AMCC). AMCC is the functional name for the Command
and Control (C2) flight which is a part of each Air Mobility Squadron (AMS). AMCCs
provide C2 support at key en route locations. Normally OCONUS AMCCs manage all
aircraft and aircrews operating AMC and AMC—gained missions through their location.
Assigned personnel monitor strategic mobility missions, report mission movement for theater
assigned C-130 forces (when operating on AMC missions), and coordinate ground support
activities to include maintenance, aerial port services, and aircrew support for all AMC and
AMC-gained missions transiting their station.
Air Mobility Control Team (AMCT).—The AMCT serves as AMD‟s centralized source of air
mobility C3 during mission execution. The Chief of AMD uses the AMCT to direct or redirect,
as required, air mobility forces in concert with aerospace forces to respond to requirement
changes, higher priorities, or immediate execution limitations. The AMCT deconflicts all air
mobility operations into, out of, and within the AOR/JOA. The AMCT maintains execution
process and communications connectivity for tasking, coordinating, and flight following with the
AOC COD, subordinate air mobility units, and mission forces.
Air Mobility Control Unit (AMCU). The terms "AMS, AMCF, ALCS, ALCF, USAFE
AMS, and PACAF OSD” are interchangeable and describe the in—garrison unit identifier.
Unless otherwise noted, the term “Air Mobility Control Unit (AMCU)” collectively refers to
those units. (OPR: DOO)
Air Mobility Division (AMD).—One of five divisions that make up the Air and Space
Operations Center (AOC). The AMD plans, coordinates, tasks and executes the air mobility
mission. The AMD is comprised of four core teams: Air Mobility Control Team; Airlift Control
Team; Air Refueling Control Team, and the Aeromedical Evacuation Control Team.
Air and Space Operations Center (AOC). The principal air operations installation (land—
based or sea-based) from which all aircraft and air warning functions or tactical air operations
are controlled. The AOC is the senior air operations element of the theater air control system.
Air Refueling Control Point (ARCP). The planned geographic point over which the
receiver(s) arrives in the observation/precontact position with respect to the assigned
tanker. Ref. T.O. 1—1C-1
Air Refueling Control Team (ARCT).—The air refueling control team plans and tasks air
refueling missions to support theater aerospace operations and coordinates air refueling planning,
tasking, and scheduling to support an air bridge and/or global attack missions within the
AOR/JOA.
Air Refueling Exit Point (A/R EXIT PT).—The designated geographic point at which the
refueling track terminates. In a refueling anchor it is a designated point where tanker and
receiver may depart the anchor area after refueling is complete.
Air Refueling Initial Point (ARIP).—A point located upstream from the ARCP at which the
receiver aircraft initiates a rendezvous with the tanker.
Air Refueling Track.—A track designated for air refueling.
 68                                                          AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


Airlift Requirement.—That tonnage (passengers, cargo, medical evacuees, and/or mail)
required to be airlifted to or from an area during a definite period.
Allowable Cabin Load (ACL).—The maximum payload that can be carried on a landing gross
weight, or by the maximum zero fuel weight.
Alternate Airfield.—An airfield specified in a flight plan to which a flight may proceed when a
landing at the point of first intended destination becomes inadvisable.
AMC—assigned Airlift Forces. Airlift forces assigned to AMC and over which AMC/CC
exercises operational control.
Augmented Aircrew. A basic aircrew supplemented by additional aircrew members to
permit in—flight rest periods. As a minimum, an augmented crew provides for in-flight rest for
crewmembers, if they are authorized and required for aircraft being flown or missions being
performed. Ref. AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
Block Time. Block—out time is the time when the aircraft chocks are withdrawn, brakes
released, and the aircraft begins to taxi from parking for takeoff. Block-in time is the time when
the aircraft physically stops in its parking slot upon arrival and is chocked.
Blue Bark.—US military personnel, US citizen civilian employees of the DOD, and the
dependents of both categories who travel in connection with the death of an immediate family
member. It also applies to escorts for dependents of military members traveling under competent
orders.
Border Clearance.—Those clearances and inspections required to comply with Federal, state,
and local Agricultural, Customs, Immigration, and immunization requirements.
Cancel Itinerary Stop.—In GDSS, the act of cancelling an air event/location and proceeding to
the next scheduled event/location. This is commonly referred to as an “overflight.”
Change of Operational Control (CHOP). The date and time (Greenwich Mean Time—
GMT) at which the responsibility for operational control of a force or unit passes from one
operational control authority to another. The CHOP point is the geographical position where
responsibility for operational control of a mission is transferred.
Channel Airlift. Common—user airlift service provided on a scheduled basis between two
points.
Channel Traffic.—The movement of passengers and cargo over established worldwide routes
served by scheduled aircraft under the control of AMC or commercial aircraft under contract to
AMC.
Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF).—A fleet made up of civil aircraft volunteered by US carriers
to augment the airlift capability of AMC in times of crisis or national emergency.
Close Hold Missions.—Certain highly sensitive missions that require special handling, limited
access, and modification to normal command and control procedures.
Close Watch Missions.—Term used to ensure designated missions receive special attention. All
possible actions are taken to ensure on time accomplishment, and users are notified when
deviations occur or can be anticipated.
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                         69


Coin Assist.—Nickname designating dependent spouses, accompanying dependent children, and
dependent parents of military personnel reported missing or captured who may travel space
available on military aircraft for humanitarian purposes upon approval of the Chief of Staff, US
Army; Chief, Naval Operations; Chief of Staff, US Air Force; or the Commandant of the Marine
Corps.
Command and Control Manager.—The OIC, chief, superintendent, or NCOIC directly in
charge of the CP/AMCC.
Command & Control System.—The facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, and
personnel essential to a commander for planning, directing, and controlling operations of
assigned forces pursuant to the mission. The facilities, equipment, communications, procedures,
and personnel essential to a commander for planning, directing, and controlling operations of
assigned forces pursuant to the mission assigned.
Command Post (CP). A C2 center from which the commander and staff direct actions in
support of the unit's assigned mission. The CP is the focal point of the unit operation, and
as such receives and disseminates orders, information, and requests necessary for the C2 of
assigned forces and operations. Each Air Force base has some type of CP—-base, wing,
major command (MAJCOM)-- or a combination of CPs at the same base. The number of
personnel required to operate a CP depends on the mission supported. Air Mobility Control
Centers (AMCCs) are primarily located overseas.
Common User Airlift Service.—The airlift service (military or commercial augmentation)
provided on a common basis for all DOD agencies and as authorized for other components of the
US government.
Contingency Response Element (CRE). A provisional, deployed AMC organization
established at fixed, en route, and deployed locations where AMC operational support is
non—existent or insufficient. A CRE provides continuing on-site management of AMC airfield
operations including C2, communications, aerial port, maintenance, security, services, weather,
finance, contracting and intelligence--the critical elements needed to ensure a safe and highly
efficient air base for all tanker and airlift operations. The CRE is composed of Contingency
Support elements from various units and deploys in support of Special Assignment Airlift
Mission (SAAM), Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT), tanker support, and
contingency and emergency relief missions on both planned and "no notice" basis. Since CREs
are deployed primarily to support AMC's global air mobility mission, they will normally remain
under the operational control of COMAMC.
Contingency Response Group (CRG). Contingency Response Groups (CRGs) are designed
to be first responders for opening airbases. These units will bridge the gap between the
seizure forces and the follow—on combat/expeditionary combat support forces. CRGs are
critical to the AF‟s ability to rapidly deploy U.S. military forces and initiate air operations of any
type in minimal time at any base or location around the globe. CRGs may also provide C2,
aerial port services, quick turn maintenance, force protection and various airbase support
capabilities for AMC‟s Global Mobility mission. The CRG CONOPs and AFI 10-202,
Contingency Response Groups, describes CRG operations. HQ AMC/A3MM is the functional
manager for the CRGs.

He/she is an aircraft dispatcher licensed by the FAA and certified by the 618 AOC. The Flight
Manager is in partnership with the aircraft commander for the safety and operational control of
flights. To expedite and ensure safety of flight, the Flight Manager authorizes, regulates and
manages assigned flights according to military and FAA regulations. The primary focus of the
Flight Manager is to accomplish flight planning for the sortie by checking NOTAMS, weather,
airfield suitability, etc., filing the flight plan with ATC, and producing a set of departure papers
for the crew‟s review and acceptance.
Global Air Traffic Management (GATM).—AMC‟s program to equip for future worldwide
Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.
Global Command and Control System (GCCS).—GCCS is the command and control system

                                         Attachment 2
  AIRCREW/AIRCRAFT TASKING SYSTEM COMMITMENT LEVEL DEVIATION
                           REPORTING

A2.1. General. The Aircrew Aircraft Tasking System (AATS) is designed to assist AMC
leadership and unit commanders in striking a balance between wing training requirements and 18
AF/AOC operational requirements through optimizing aircrew and aircraft allocations. AMC
CONOPS for the Aircrew/Aircraft Tasking System (AATS) governs the policy and procedure of
the program. AMC/A3OO is the OPR for the CONOPS; it is available on the AMC/A3OO AF
Portal webpage: https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a33/A33O/index.htm.            This attachment
establishes guidance for reporting AATS commitment level deviations; it does not establish
AATS policy.
   A2.1.1. Execution Period. The execution period for AATS is 24-hour day based on
   Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), a.ka., “Zulu” time.
A2.2. Commitment Threshold. Commitment thresholds are used to forecast how many
possessed aircraft will be available for tasking. For deviation reporting purposes only,
aircraft on 618 AOC-tasked missions are considered committed from the standard spot
time (in Zulu) prior to launch until mission termination at home station. Possessed aircraft that
are delayed in the system are still committed until actual mission termination at home station.
   A2.2.1. Wing Current Operations or Maintenance Operations Centers will provide the unit
   C2 agency with AATS information or C2 controllers may retrieve ATTS via the AMC/A4
   AF                         Portal:                        https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
   af/USAF/AFP40/d/1074111948/Files/a4m/aats/hello.html.
A2.3. Commitment Level Deviations. 618 AOC Commitment rate is generally defined as the
number of AOC-tasked aircraft on the flying schedule divided by the number of possessed
(taskable) aircraft. See Figure A2.1 and Figure A2.2 for the exact formula. Commitment rate
metrics are used for 3 purposes: (1) daily execution, (2) long range planning management, and
(3) quantifying past performance.
   A2.3.1. Daily Execution Management: Commitment rate is used to identify delayed
   missions due to over-commitment, which saturates a unit‟s ability to generate aircraft. 618
   AOC commitment rate measures how many 618 AOC taskable aircraft are in use or within
   their allocated spot time prior to take-off for delay accountability purposes only.
       A2.3.1.1. AMC standard spot time is the maintenance release time prior to takeoff. The
       unit will determine and report the commitment level at spot time by using the formula
       below. Example: The spot time would affect the C-17 commitment rate if a deviation
       occurred within 5 hours of the scheduled takeoff time for a C-17 mission. KC-10
       Exception: 12 hours for off-station 618 AOC missions, 2 hours for other missions.

Figure A2.1. Execution Commitment Rate Formula.
 74                                                             AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


Table A2.1. AMC Standard Spot Times.
                                    AMC Standard Spot Times
                                        C-5           8 hours
                                        C-17          5 hours
                                       C-130          4 hours
                                      KC-135          4 hours
                                        KC-10       12 hours
A2.3.1.2. If commitment level at mission spot time exceeds 100% of the AATS for 618 AOC
taskable aircraft or crews, the mission becomes eligible for a 505 or 516 deviation code
(regardless of commitment rate at scheduled takeoff time). Additionally, missions that are
slipped by 618 AOC (normally, “The Barrel”) prior to spot time for forecasted tail availability
are also eligible for either deviation code.
       A2.3.1.3. Units will identify potential delays at spot time with a GDSS advisory that
       includes the current commitment level and ETD based on aircraft/aircrew availability.
       Continue to update the mission ETD via advisories if the mission departure time
       continues to slip for aircraft/aircrew availability. Over commitment at spot time does not
       alleviate the generation of aircraft, rather, it identifies the potential for a delay to occur.
       A2.3.1.4. Overcommitment Deviation Codes.
           A2.3.1.4.1. The 505 code is used when the unit is over committed because aircraft
           have not returned home at the original mission termination date.
           A2.3.1.4.2. The 516 deviation code is used when the unit is over tasked due to HQ
           scheduling (intentionally or erroneously).
           A2.3.1.4.3. Both deviation codes can only be used for 618 AOC missions and only
           for the number of missions exceeding the 618 AOC taskable allocation—not for
           every deviation encountered, i.e., one aircraft over committed, three deviations occur,
           only one mission should be coded with the 505 or 516 deviation code.
           A2.3.1.4.4. 505 and 516 deviation remarks will contain the spot time commitment
           level percentage, unless the mission was slipped prior to spot time by 618 AOC. In
           addition, 505 deviation remarks will include the late returning mission(s) that caused
           over-commitment.
           A2.3.1.4.5. The 516 deviation time will be determined from the difference between
           initial scheduled mission departure time and unit determined aircraft/aircrew
           availability mission departure time. Once the unit establishes a mission departure
           time, any further delay results in a secondary code and delay time from the unit
           established departure time.
           A2.3.1.4.6. If the unit approved a crew enhancement deviation on a mission/aircraft
           that could have been utilized, preventing an over committed situation, a 500-series
           code will not be used.
   A2.3.2. Long-range Planning Management: Long-range planning of capabilities is the most
   effective use of commitment rate and is an integral part of the Aircrew/Aircraft Tasking
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                  75


   System (AATS). Long-range AATS planning uses the commitment rate listed in Table A2.1
   to calculate the daily number of 618 AOC taskable aircraft and is calculated by AMC/A3O
   one time prior to the beginning of execution period using the following formula:

Figure A2.2. 618 AOC AATS Formula.




       A2.3.2.1. Adjustments are management inputs to the AATS process to properly account
       for all AMC aircraft and all adjustments are clearly defined in the AATS process. The
       number of authorized allocated trainers is set by AMC/A3O for each unit and provided to
       the units via the AATS process.
   A2.3.3. Quantifying Past Performance: Overall commitment rate measures the total impact
   of all unit taskings to include 618 AOC missions/alerts/spares, deployments, and local
   training (including maintenance and ground trainers). Exceeding overall commitment
   thresholds while staying below the 618 AOC commitment threshold of 100% will not result
   in authorized use of the over commitment deviation codes. However, operating above the
   planned overall commitment threshold will have negative long-term effects on aircraft fleet
   health. Overall commitment rate is calculated using the following formula:

Figure A2.3. Overall Commitment Level Formula.




Note 1: Possessed aircraft are based on the Possession Identifier (PI) codes “IF” for C-17, and
C-5; and “CA” for C-130, KC-10 and KC-135. PI codes are listed in AFI 33-110, Data
Administration Program, and rules for reporting are in AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status,
and Utilization Reporting.
Note 2: Include CHOPd and stage aircraft in the deployed number.
A2.4. Contingency Operations. During contingencies or increased operations, and at the
direction of AMC/CV, schedulers will use the contingency commitment rates in Table A2.2. for
commitment level monitoring. AMC/A3O calculates the contingency commitment rate, using
the AATS formula, and provides schedulers the new number of taskable aircraft.

Table A2.2. AMC Overall Planning Commitment Levels.
                          MDS          Normal       Contingency/Surge
                           C-5          65 %              75 %
                          C-17          85 %              90 %
                         C-130J         75 %              85 %
                        C-130E/H        65%               75%
                         KC-135         80 %              85 %
76                                                       AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


                       KC-10           80 %              80 %
  A2.4.1. As directed by AMC/CC or AMC/CV, AMC may enter a max surge operation
  where commitment levels and thresholds no longer apply. During this period use of the
  “505/516” deviation codes is authorized only when the contingency/surge rate identified in
  Table A2.2 is exceeded.
     A2.4.1.1. If 618 AOC tasks an outbound mission on a returning aircraft and does not
     allow allotted spot time prior to take off, use deviation code 517. All other deviations
     will be recorded for the underlying cause of the deviation. The 517 deviation code is
     only authorized during AMC/CC or AMC/CV maximum surge operations.
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                      77

 MAF COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS
                           (C4)

A3.1. General. There are numerous systems that provide commanders and other key personnel
at all levels with timely and accurate data for command and control of MAF resources. It is
imperative that these systems be utilized as they were intended to ensure effective visibility and
control of these resources. This chapter outlines duties, responsibilities, and policies for the
current primary systems used at Force and Unit levels for mission and resource management and
the execution of MAF missions. It also provides a brief description of other related systems, and
provides an explanation of how these systems work together to provide global visibility of MAF
resources.
A3.2. System Training. Management at all levels is responsible for ensuring users of MAF C4
systems satisfy specific training standards prior to making unsupervised entries.
A3.3. ACARS. The Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System is a digital
data link system transmitted via VHF, SATCOM, and HF radio that allows airline flight
operations departments to communicate with the various aircraft in their flight. ACARS can be
considered to be “e-mail for airplanes” as it achieves near real-time delivery of weather, flight
plans, and other message capabilities. Aircraft equipped with ACARS messaging will
automatically populate movement times in GDSS with actual time of landing, block-in, block-
out, and ATD. Controllers will have the ability to overwrite times. Currently, GDSS exchanges
information with ACARS equipped KC-135, C-5, and C-17 Aircraft. The C-130, KC-10, and
KC-X aircraft are also programmed to acquire an ACARS capability in the future.
A3.4. ACFP. The Advanced Computer Flight Plan system is designed to generate wind-
optimized flight plans. Unit mission planners, 618 AOC Flight Planners and 618 AOC Flight
Managers use this system to select optimum flight profiles and routes for MAF aircraft. In
peacetime, flight plans must meet requirements for automating aircrew flight plan tasks. In
addition, flight plans must meet requirements for maximizing cargo loads and conserving fuel.
During wartime, flight plans must provide flight planners the flexibility to select options, which,
for example, minimize the fuel taken out of theater, maximize cargo loads, minimize or avoid
threat areas, and ensure accurate time over target.
A3.5. ARMS. Accessed via the CAMPS Portal, the Air Refueling Management System (a
component of the Consolidated Air Mobility Planning System—CAMPS) provides the DoD air
refueling operations community a web-based refueling request, validation, and tanker unit
assignment/volunteer capability to synchronize global AR requirements management. ARMS
provides a display of track availability to the user to assist in track and request submissions.
ARMS was directed to be used by USTRANSCOM on 1 Oct 2008 for the submission of air
refueling requests of all types (Coronets, short-notice, long-range Horseblanket, business efforts,
etc.) where the air refueling requests/events and availability of tanker resources is managed at
USTRANSCOM, MAJCOM, AOC, and the unit levels. ARMS works in an integrated manner
with the CAMPS Client Air Refueling Manager application.
A3.6. CAMPS. The Consolidated Air Mobility Planning System is AMC's force-level C2
planning and scheduling system that provides mission planners with tools for airlift/air refueling
requirements management at the USTRANSCOM and AOC, and MAF mission planning and
 78                                                             AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011


scheduling during peacetime, contingency, humanitarian, and wartime operations. Operating
separate unclassified and classified systems, CAMPS interfaces with other C2 systems to
providing mission schedules and event information. The CAMPS Portal manages a user access
to the CAMPS web-based requirements applications of ARMS, SRS, ITARS, PPR, and DCS.
CAMPS training is available through the USAF Expeditionary Center's Detachment 1 for
AOC/AMD, and Det 2 for the 618 AOC. The web-applications have online training materials
for approved users.
A3.7. Combat Track II. Combat Track II provides two-way secure communication messaging
between multiple ground and airborne nodes. It also provides in-flight following via automatic
Global Position System (GPS) position reports displayed on standard navigation charts. The
CTII system can be used in support of contingency operations and close watch/high interest
missions within AMC.
A3.8. G081 Broker. G081 is the Core Automated Maintenance System for Mobility. G081
provides the Air Mobility Command (AMC) both a worldwide maintenance management system
and a Logistics Command and Control (C2) capability for aircraft. The system provides a central
database of real-time updates and access to critical logistics information. It provides visibility of
aircraft operational status, aircraft location, aircraft historical discrepancies, aircraft modification
status, personnel information, support equipment information, and shop production information.
G081 and GDSS share information through the AMC Interface Device. Each system updates the
other with parking spots, fuel, MX status, itineraries, etc.
A3.9. GATES. The Global Air Transportation Execution System is a transportation system for
AMC to support USTRANSCOM's DTS 2010 Integration Plan requirements. GATES
functionality includes cargo and passenger processing information used to direct AMC mobility
operations worldwide, providing the air portion of passenger and cargo In-transit Visibility (ITV)
information to the Global Transportation Network (GTN).
A3.10. GDSS. Global Decision Support System is AMC‟s primary C2 system, which provides
C2 information to over 40 other systems for the aircrew and aircraft scheduling, management
and execution of airlift and air refueling missions. It is designed to provide global visibility over
MAF missions and other command forces that are linked to the MAF missions.
    A3.10.1. Each functional user is responsible for submitting accurate and valid data. Each
    OIC/Superintendent supporting functional users is responsible for operator training within his
    or her functional area. GDSS provides an organizational training database for user training.
    A3.10.2. Each wing/unit commander will assign a GDSS Functional Area Coordinator
    (FAC). FAC duties, as listed in the User‟s Manual, include being the overall POC for GDSS
    matters, conducting periodic Users‟ Group meetings, as well as ensuring an effective unit-
    level training program. Users‟ access to GDSS is based on the user‟s role (Duty Position)
    and the privileges associated with that role. This defines what data is requested from the
    servers and brought down to the client.
A3.11. GTN. USTRANSCOM Global Transportation Network (GTN) collects and integrates
transportation information from selected transportation systems. The resulting information is
provided to the President and Secretary of Defense, combatant commanders, USTRANSCOM,
its component commands, and to DOD customers to support transportation planning and
AMCI10-202V6 15 MARCH 2011                                                                      79


decision making during peace and war. GTN gives users a seamless, real-time ability to access
both classified and unclassified transportation and deployment information.
A3.12. Reports Information Database Library (RIDL). The set of applications that accesses
GDSS historic data from either the AMC History System (AHS) for mission data prior to Jan
2005 or from the AMC Data Warehouse (ADW) for mission data Jan 2005 to current. To access
RIDL, users must have a valid GDSS account with reports privileges. Users can use RIDL for
on-demand reports as well as scheduled reports. HQ AMC/A3RS is the single point of contact
for all requests for data from GDSS from any agency outside of the Department of Defense.
A3.13. SMS. The Single Mobility System is a USTRANSCOM system which is composed of
requirements visibility and electronic mission trading, data entry, collaboration, and after action
reporting. It also contains a limited read-only flight-following capability with data from GDSS.
SMS receives visibility on CAMPS notional missions and HQ mission schedules before tasking
actions are determined by 618 AOC for 618 AOC-tasked missions and provide ARC volunteer
unit information for both the aircraft/aircrew and Aeromedical unit to support HQ Aeromedical
Evacuation mission scheduling.
A3.14. TBMCS. The Theater Battle Management Core System functionality includes
intelligence processing, air campaign planning, execution and monitoring, as well as weather
monitoring and analysis. TBMCS is used to produce the theater ATO and Special Instructions
(SPINS) for all aircraft within the Area of Responsibility (AOR). At the force-level, TBMCS
supports the Joint Forces Commander (JFC) through the Air and Space Operations Center
(AOC) and Air Support Operations Center (ASOC).
A3.15. TMDS. The Table Management Distribution System is an AMC unique system that
standardizes reference data for MAF C2 systems i.e., units, aircraft type, tail numbers, etc.
When reference data is ready to be distributed, TMDS sends the data to external systems
(GDSS). User inputs are validated against these tables prior to transmission to ensure data
integrity.
A3.16. TRAC2ES. The TRANSCOM Regulating and Command & Control Evaluation System
(TRAC2ES) combines transportation, logistics, and clinical decision elements into a seamless
patient movement automated information system. It is capable of visualizing, assessing, and
prioritizing patient movement requirements, assigning proper resources, and distributing relevant
data to deliver patients efficiently. The system automates the processes of medical regulation
(assignment of patients to suitable medical treatment facilities) and aeromedical evacuation
during peace, war, and contingency operations. TRAC2ES automates Global/Theater Patient
Movement Requirements Center operations at HQ, United States Transportation Command
(USTRANSCOM); HQ, United States European Command; and HQ, United States Pacific
Command. TRAC2ES also provides deployable Patient Movement Requirements Center
capabilities to support CINC or JTF requirements on a global basis. TRAC2ES supports the
Joint Vision 2010 concept of focused logistics by fusing information, logistics, and
transportation technologies to provide rapid medical regulation and patient evacuation during
crisis situations. It enables a deployed force to be more efficient in protecting lives.
