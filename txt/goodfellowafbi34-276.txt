1. Responsibilities.
   1.1. Parents/Caretakers.
       1.1.1. Must care for their children and provide necessary supervision to ensure their
       safety. Parents and caretakers should rely on common sense and the information and
       guidance provided in this instruction to decide at what age their children are old enough
       to be left unsupervised. In determining the appropriate supervision guideline to follow,

         parents must consider another factor. In addition to the age of the child, remember each
         child is unique and their emotional and physical capabilities can vary. Your decision
         should be based on both factors. Refer to guidelines in Attachment 2.
         1.1.2. With children of multiple ages in the house, it is not the primary job of the eldest
         child, but of the parent, to ensure supervision of the younger child/children. Parent must
         follow the set guidelines—the age of the youngest child determines the appropriate
         guideline to follow.
     1.2. Family Advocacy Office. Will provide a Home Alone Training Course for Goodfellow
     AFB family members.
     1.3. Youth Center. Will provide the Red Cross Babysitting Course mandatory for sitters.
     1.4. Sitters.
         1.4.1. Before being allowed to baby-sit, must take Red Cross Babysitting Course
         provided by the Youth Center.
         1.4.2. Must follow the baby-sitting guidelines in Attachment 2.
2. Rules for Child/Children Left Unattended in Vehicle. Children under the age of 7 years
cannot be left unattended in a car without adult supervision. Under no circumstance will any
child be left in a vehicle with its motor running or with its keys accessible. Refer to the
guidelines in Attachment 2.
3. General Rules for Child/Children Left Unattended.
     3.1. When children meet age requirements (see Attachment 2), they may be left unattended
     only if there are no emotional or medical conditions and only if the child is comfortable and
     fully aware of the situation. In all cases, the children must have emergency telephone
     numbers and a number to locate a parent or designated, responsible adult.
     3.2. Leaving a child unattended inappropriately may constitute the offense of child neglect.
     Violations may result in Security Forces reports being forwarded to both the unit commander
     and Family Advocacy Office for action and concurrent notice to Texas Department of
     Protective and Regularity Services.
     3.3. Making Goodfellow AFB a safe place for children is the responsibility of every member
     of the Goodfellow community. Make sure your decisions about child supervision are safe
     and responsible.

Note: The ages specified are the maximum ages and are based on the child’s ability to

appropriate behavior should not be given the same degree of self-management responsibilities.

judgment and for any incident or mishap (not considered preventable) which occurs.
