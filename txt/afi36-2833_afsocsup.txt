   81.19. (Added-AFSOC) Commando Safety Recognition for Contributions and
   Support. When individuals receive AFSEC's Koren Kolligian, Jr., Trophy, wing and group
   commanders, at the request of an awardee, may nominate contributing and supporting units
   and persons for Commando Safety recognition. These nominations recognize persons and
   units who made significant contributions or provided significant support that directly led to a
   person winning the Air Force level award. Nominations that do not fully justify an award are
   generally returned without further action. Depending on the significance of an approved
   nomination, the Director of Safety will award the appropriate Commando Safety recognition.
   This system allows commanders and major Air Force level award winners to fully participate
   in the command safety awards program and ensure deserving personnel are appropriately
   recognized.
82. (Added-AFSOC) AFSOC Award Presentation Items. AFSOC presents four generic
items for recognition in the Commando Safety awards program:

                             2D SPECIAL OPERATIONS WING

The Air Force Chief of Safety Outstanding Achievement Award for Ground Safety, Category II,
for fiscal year 2011 is presented to the 2d Special Operations Wing, Hurlburt Field, Florida.
During this period, the wing oversaw an amazing turn-around in off-duty fatalities, reducing the
number from nine during the previous two years to zero in 2011. Their world-class safety
education programs trained more than 2,500 base personnel in a myriad of supervisory,
motorcycle, and traffic safety subjects. Relevant world-wide, safety personnel supported safety
programs and investigations in five countries, including the only United States military ground
safety expert during humanitarian relief operations in the earthquake-damaged country of Haiti.
Absolute professionals, their multi-faceted awareness program resulted in wing personnel safely
navigating the 101 Critical Days of Summer and every major holiday.             The distinctive
accomplishments of the men and women of the 2d Special Operations Wing reflect great credit
upon themselves, Air Force Special Operations Command, and the United States Air Force.
