   (two dashed and two solid) or instrument hold line which has two horizontal lines with
   vertical lines across the taxiway (See Attachment 5).
   4.10.2.1. Individuals are not permitted in the controlled movement area (See Attachment 3)
   unless they are performing official duties, have established 2-way radio communications with
   Robins control tower and have been given permission to enter the controlled movement area
   from the control tower.
   4.10.2.2. Vehicles must be equipped with a rotating beacon operating when in the CMA.
   Vehicles not equipped must have emergency flasher operating to assist ATC in identification
   of vehicles in the CMA.
   4.10.2.3. Two-way radio communications with Robins control tower must be maintained
   while in the    controlled movement area. Airfield Management keeps a current list callsigns
   that are used by vehicles needing to operate within the CMA.
         4.10.2.4. To enter the controlled movement area the following phraseology applies,
         ―Robins Ground‖, (who you are, where you are, and what you want to do).‖ Example,
         ―Robins Ground, this is Ops 1 on taxiway B, request permission on the runway.‖
         4.10.2.5. To leave the controlled movement area state, ―
                                                                Robins Ground, (who you are,
         where you have left and your intentions Example, ―
                                                          Robins Ground, this is Ops 1, I am off
         the runway.‖
         4.10.2.6. Vehicle operators will acknowledge and immediately comply with all
         instructions received from the control tower. It is the responsibility of the vehicle
         operator to understand all instructions received from the control tower. If there is any
         doubt as to what the control tower’s instructions are, the vehicle operator will remain
         outside of the controlled movement area, or leave the radio controlled movement area,
         and ask for clarification. Pay close attention to what the controller says. Requesting
         permission to cross is not always approved. If hold instructions are given, repeat them
         back to the controller verbatim and wait for further instructions. Hold short instructions
         phraseology is as follows:
VEHICLE: ―    Robins Ground Ops 1, on Taxiway Bravo, request permission to cross from Bravo
to fire lane.‖ GROUND CONTROL: ― 1 Robins Ground, HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY at
                                      Ops
Bravo.‖ VEHICLE: ―     Robins Ground, Ops 1 holding short of runway at Bravo‖
NOTE: ***Always read back all instructions received from ground control***
      4.10.3. If radio contact is lost or suspected to be lost while in the CMA:
         4.10.3.1. Immediately exit the CMA, (do not cross any other CMAs) and proceed to
         Airfield Management operations (AM Ops) and brief them on the incident
NOTE: Do not cross the runway or other controlled movement areas during radio failure.
         4.10.3.2. Monitor the tower for light-gun signals.
RAFBI13-213 29 November 2011                                                                     19


       4.10.3.3. Be vigilant of repeated changes of the intensity of runway lights. Such actions
       indicate that the vehicle operator should immediately depart the runway and contact the
       tower or observe and adhere to light gun signals.
       4.10.3.4. Be vigilant of the repeated flashing of the runway/taxiway lights. Such an
       action indicates     that the vehicle operator should immediately depart the CMA and
       contact the tower or observe and adhere to light gun signals.
NOTE: For vehicles not on the CMA, flashing lights indicate that you should give way to taxiing
aircraft and if able, contact tower.
   4.10.4. All vehicles requesting access to the runway will hold short of the VFR/INST hold
   markings and the white stop bars on access roads (See Attachment 3 and Attachment 5)
   until instructed by the control tower to proceed. Vehicle operators will report off of the
   runway. DO NOT use the words ―CLEAR‖, ―CLEARED‖ or ―CLEARENCE‖.
   4.10.5. Drivers of vehicles without 2-way radio communications capability with Robins
   control tower, who require entry into the controlled movement area, will:
       4.10.5.1. Contact their host unit for an escort vehicle that is equipped with 2-way radio
       communications.
       4.10.5.2. Or, when an escort vehicle is not available, checkout hand-held radio for use in
       the controlled movement area from AM Ops.
4.11. Restricted Visibility or Night Operations.
   4.11.1. Hazard lights or parking lights will be used at night, during daytime restricted
   visibility conditions and when vehicles are temporarily parked on any part of the aircraft-
   parking ramp. This does not apply to designated parking areas.
   4.11.2. If visibility falls below 300 feet additional restrictions apply. Headlights will be used
   during foggy/rain conditions regardless of visibility levels.
   4.11.3. Less than 300 feet. Refueling and explosive loaded vehicles will not be operated
   unless directed by wing or installation commander.
   4.11.4. Less than 100 feet. POVs and flightline vehicles (except emergency and alert
   vehicles) will not be operated on the airfield.
   4.11.5. Less than 50 feet. Recommended that a walking guide equipped with a flashing or
   luminescent wand be used during emergency movement of alert vehicles.
   4.11.6. Vehicle operators will exercise caution to ensure headlights are not pointed toward
   taxiing aircraft or towing operations, this will ensure aircraft or tow vehicle operators are not
   blinded.
NOTE: The AFM, AAM, or designated AM representative may suspend airfield driving due to
weather and other circumstances. AMOPS will disseminate any such suspensions via any means
necessary to include, but not limited to: the Base Ramp Net, Maintenance Control, and Robins
Command Post.
4.12. Control Tower Light-Gun Signals. All flightline authorized operators will have a tower
light gun signal decal, ATC LIGHT GUN SIGNALS, (available through their ADPM) displayed
