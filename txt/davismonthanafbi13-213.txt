                                          GENERAL.

1.1. The purpose of this instruction is to establish procedures to govern all vehicle
operations on the airfield. Only trained personnel will be assigned duties that include driving
on the airfield. Trained personnel must have the necessary knowledge base to comply with this
instruction. The use of vehicles on the airfield will be limited to the absolute minimum
necessary to accomplish the mission. Safe operation of vehicles on the airfield is absolutely
essential to normal aircraft operations and maintenance. Vehicles present a clear and definite
danger, to both aircraft and ground personnel. Carelessness, haste, and a disregard for
established safety standards are major factors in aircraft/vehicle collisions, incidents, and
personal injuries. Airfield drivers must be familiar with the provisions of this instruction and
exercise their best judgment if they encounter situations that are not covered by published
guidance.
1.2. Unit Commanders, unit Airfield Driving Program Managers (ADPMs), and Airfield
Management (AM) have the authority to revoke/suspend airfield driving privileges of any
individual who fails or refuses to comply with the procedures established in this
instruction, or other applicable guidance.
1.3. All personnel on the airfield are responsible for monitoring airfield safety, detecting
unauthorized personnel/vehicles and immediately reporting airfield violations to Airfield
Management Operations (AM Ops) and/or the Base Defense Operations Center
(BDOC). If necessary, the SFCC will dispatch a patrol to apprehend violators. AM Ops will
determine appropriate action, to include suspension of airfield driving privileges and notification
of the individual’s commander.
1.4. All base assigned personnel who operate a vehicle on the airfield must complete all
training and testing requirements. Prior airfield experience (e.g., operating vehicles or
aircraft) is not a substitute for completion of ADFP training and testing requirements.
1.5. AM customer service and testing hours for the Airfield Driver’s Familiarization
Program are as follows: Walk-Ins: Sundays through Saturday 24 hours a day. No testing
service available on federal holidays, during exercises, or 355 FW approved down days.
Personnel must bring all applicable documentation to AM Ops before being allowed to test to
include a completed Davis-Monthan AFB Form 7, Computer Based Training (CBT) test results
and phraseology training test results. Contact your unit ADPM with questions referencing the
ADFP prior to contacting AM Ops.
1.6. Privately Owned Vehicles (POVs) on the airfield are highly discouraged and shall be
restricted to an absolute minimum. Requests for POV passes must be processed according to
paragraph 7 and Attachment 5.

      unit ADPM. This ensures the unit list is updated. The ADPM will return the DMAFB
      Form 7 to the individual.
      3.1.3.2. When personnel PCA between units on base, the losing ADPM ensures all
      airfield driving records (Form 7, 7a, CBT printout, etc) are transferred to the gaining unit
      ADPM. The losing ADPM removes the individual from the unit’s list of airfield drivers.
      The gaining ADPM will verify currency of the individual’s training and transcribe
      information to a new Davis-Monthan Form 7 for the new unit. The new ADPM will add
      the individual to the list of qualified unit personnel. The individual will report to AM
      Ops with both old and new records. AM Ops will endorse the new Davis-Monthan Form
      7 and update the master driver list. After the new form is endorsed, the old form will be
      destroyed. NOTE: If personnel are PCAing within a program new paper work does not
      need to be accomplished.
   3.1.4. Lost Documentation.
      3.1.4.1. Personnel who lose their AF IMT 483 can be reissued a new one by hand
      carrying the original DMAFB Form 7 or 7a to AM Ops. AM Ops will verify
      training/testing documentation and issue a new AF IMT 483.
      3.1.4.2. Personnel who lose their DMAFB Form 7 or 7a, and still have a valid AF IMT
      483 for Davis-Monthan AFB may be recertified to drive on airfield by the unit ADPM.
      The ADPM will complete a new DMAFB Form 7 or 7a and make a statement on the
      form to indicate it is a replacement for a lost original or refresher and verify all training
      requirements are current.

      3.1.10.2. Second time failures must receive additional training from their unit ADPM
      and document on a memorandum for record, endorsed by the unit commander (may not
      be delegated) with justification stating the trainee is safe for airfield operations. Trainees
      can be rescheduled for testing upon completion of additional training and the
      commander’s endorsement letter but no earlier than 30 days from the second failure.
      3.1.10.3. Third time failures will normally not be granted airfield driving privileges
      without the approval of the AFM or DAFM.
   3.1.11. Phraseology Test.
      3.1.11.1. The ADPM (or trainer) will conduct a standard radio phraseology test, ensuring
      the trainee is proficient in accordance with the references listed below. Annotate
      completion on the DMAFB Form 7. The phraseology test is required for all airfield
      drivers.
      3.1.11.2. Standard Radio Phraseology. Proper use of the phonetic alphabet, procedures
      for making requests, CMA procedures, monitoring requirements, approved call signs (see
      Attachment 8) must be used when communicating with the Control Tower. For standard
      radio phraseology definitions see Table 3.1.

        3.1.11.3. Never use the words ―CLEAR,‖ ―CLEARED,‖ or ―CLEARANCE‖ when in
        radio communications with the Control Tower. These words are reserved for ATC/Pilot
        takeoff and landing approval only.
        3.1.11.4. Observe proper radio discipline at all times. Transmissions will be brief,
        clearly spoken, and include only information pertinent to the situation. When inside the
        CMA, the operator must monitor radio communications at all times. All instructions
        received should be read back for verification. This is especially important concerning all
        hold short instructions and clearances. If in doubt, ask for a repeat of the transmission.
        Drivers exiting their vehicles in the CMA must carry a hand-held radio at all times.
        3.1.11.5. Sample Radio Communication:
              3.1.11.5.1. Call sign of station being called (who you are calling).
              3.1.11.5.2. Your call sign (who you are).
              3.1.11.5.3. Your location (where you are).
              3.1.11.5.4. Your request (what you want to do).
                 3.1.11.5.4.1. Example 1: ―DM GROUND, AIRFIELD ONE…AIRFIELD ONE,
                 DM GROUND…DM GROUND, AIRFIELD ONE ON TAXIWAY ALPHA

NOTE: Syllables to be emphasized in pronunciation are in bold face.
       3.1.11.7. Use the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) pronunciation of any
       individual letters and/or numbers included in any transmission. (Table 3.1.) For instance;
       Taxi lane B is ―Taxi lane Bravo,‖ and Runway 12 is ―Runway One-Two‖.
   3.1.12. Refresher Training.
       3.1.12.1. Annual refresher training must be completed by all permanently assigned
       airfield drivers and must be annotated on their AF IMT 483.
       3.1.12.2. The minimum annual refresher training requirement is completion of the
       airfield driving CBT and review of DMAFBI 13-213.
       3.1.12.3. Annual refresher training must be completed within one year of the initial
       certification date or within one year of last refresher training date on file. Overdue
       training will require completion of initial training requirements on a new DMAFB Form
       7. Exception to policy may be requested in writing from the unit commander for
       individuals who were deployed, TDY, or who experienced circumstances beyond their
       control. Individual deployed or TDY for more than 179 days and their AF IMT 483
       expire, may present a copy of their travel orders, a completed DM Form 7a, and a current
       AF Driving CBT certificate to AM Ops for annual refresher training.
       3.1.12.4. The annual refresher training DMAFB Form 7a will be filled out completely
       and dropped off at AM Ops (Bldg 4820) for processing. The individual may pick up the
       new AF IMT 483 and DMAFB 7a after 0730 the following day. All paperwork must be
       picked up prior to the individual’s original AF IMT 483 expiration date. The ADPM will
       update the unit listing and maintain annual refresher results until the next annual refresher
       training is completed.

                    OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS.

4.1. Airfield Diagram (Attachment 2).
   4.1.1. An airfield diagram will be provided to all ADPM’s for airfield familiarization
   training. Airfield diagram training must include the following items:
      4.1.1.1. The CMA for vehicles/pedestrians as defined in this instruction.
      4.1.1.2. The location and description of Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and instrument
      (INST) holding position signs and markings.
      4.1.1.3. Airfield access points.
      4.1.1.4. Restricted Area boundaries/entry control points.
      4.1.1.5. The Controlled Area boundary.
      4.1.1.6. Vehicle traffic lanes and traffic flow.
      4.1.1.7. Critical area boundaries for precision navigational aids.
      4.1.1.8. A legend to illustrate symbols used.
4.2. CMA access and emergency removal procedures.
   4.2.1. The CMA encompasses active runways, overruns, helipad and the area within 100 feet
   laterally from the edge of the runway.
      4.2.1.1. Procedures for operating a vehicle in the CMA. No vehicle/person may enter the
      CMA without specific approval from Air Traffic Control.
          4.2.1.1.1. The Control Tower has authority over all traffic entering the CMA and will
          issue specific instructions to control movement of aircraft, vehicles, equipment, or
          personnel. Airfield hours are normally: 24 hours a day 7 days a week. NOTE:
          Drivers entering/exiting the CMA will report entry/exit over tower net. The Control
          Tower is manned 24 hours a day 7 days a week. NOTE: If a runway crossing is
          required during flying operations, the preferred crossing point is the departure end.
          4.2.1.1.2. Radio contact with the Control Tower must be established before gaining
          access to, crossing, or working in CMA. Once Control Tower approves access, radio
          contact will be maintained at all times while in CMA.
          4.2.1.1.3. Vehicles operating within the CMA must use call signs approved by AM.
          All units are required to provide AM with a list of radio call signs to be used within
          the CMA to avoid duplication (See Attachment 8).
          4.2.1.1.4. All vehicles will use a rotating beacon or emergency warning flashers
          while operating in the CMA.
          4.2.1.1.5. Words that authorize access to CMA are ―PROCEED‖ and ―CROSS‖. The
          word ―HOLD‖ indicates disapproval of an operator’s request. Drivers will never use
          “CLEAR.‖ The proper term for leaving the CMA is ―OUT OF‖ and ―OFF‖ for
          exiting the runway.
DAVISMONTHANAFBI13-213 4 APRIL 2011                                                            19


   4.2.2. Emergency Removal Procedures.
      4.2.2.1. When radio communications cannot be established between vehicle operators in
      the CMA and the Control Tower, the Control Tower will use light-gun signals to
      communicate. If light-gun signals fail, the Control Tower will raise and lower the
      intensity of the runway lights as an emergency runway exit signal.
      4.2.2.2. When a vehicle has a malfunction which prevents operation under its own
      power, every means will be used to alert taxiing aircraft and other vehicles. As a
      minimum, the vehicle operator will:
          4.2.2.2.1. Switch on the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers.
          4.2.2.2.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, contact the Control Tower and
          relay the situation. State the nature of the problem and your position on the airfield.
          4.2.2.2.3. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (Security Forces, Civil
          Engineering (CE), Transportation, etc.) will contact their control center and have the
          information relayed to the AM Operations for relay to the tower.
          4.2.2.2.4. If a vehicle is not equipped with a radio, stay with the vehicle and continue
          attempts to get the attention of the taxiing aircraft or other vehicles.
      4.2.2.3. Vehicles will NEVER be left unattended on the runway. In case of vehicle
      break-down, contact the Control Tower and AM Ops immediately. AM Ops will contact
      Transportation for removal of the vehicle.
4.3. Restricted/Controlled Areas.
   4.3.1. Restricted areas are identified by six inch wide red lines with white contrast. There
   are signs painted on the pavement surface near the red lines. These areas are accessible by
   entry control points located along flight line road and other access points. Restricted area
   access is in accordance with the local installation security instruction. NOTE: You must
   have a restricted area badge with the appropriate authorization (or be under escort) to enter
   the restricted area.
   4.3.2. Controlled Areas are identified by AFVA 31-204, Controlled Area Signs and are
   posted on controlled area boundaries and at personnel entry points. These signs/markings
   mirror the airfield boundaries.
      4.3.2.1. The entire airfield is designated as a controlled area. Only personnel designated
      by the unit commander have access into controlled areas.
      4.3.2.2. The designation ―Controlled Area‖ carries same legal and moral restrictions as a
      physical barrier.
4.4. Vehicle Parking and Chocking.
   4.4.1. Parked Vehicles. All vehicles parked and left unattended on the airfield will:
      4.4.1.1. Have the ignition turned off. Keys will remain in the ignition when vehicles are
      parked in an aircraft movement area.
      4.4.1.2. Be in reverse (standard transmission) or park (automatic transmission) (diesel
      standard transmission – neutral).

       4.4.1.3. Have emergency brake set.
       4.4.1.4. Be parked so that the direction of travel, either forward or backward, will not be
       toward any aircraft.
   4.4.2. Chocks will be used for all vehicles and equipment mounted on wheels which do not
   have an integral braking system when left unattended on the airfield, and also, when
   operating within 10 feet of any aircraft.
4.4.3. NOTE:If a vehicle becomes disabled on the airfield, the driver must ensure Airfield
Management (520-228-4315) and Transportation are notified as soon as possible.
   4.4.4. Vehicles with engines operating will never be parked unattended within aircraft
   critical areas or facing aircraft. EXCEPTION: Emergency vehicles responding to
   emergencies or aircraft servicing vehicles that must remain on to generate power to perform
   tasks.
   4.4.5. AGE-towing vehicles may be left running after setting parking brake, and placing the
   vehicle in park while driver completes hook-up or unhook operations or during FOD checks
   prior to entering the airfield. Drivers must shut off vehicle, set parking brake, and place
   vehicle in park or reverse if they do not drop off or drive off with AGE equipment
   immediately following hook-up or unhook operations. Refueling trucks may be left running
   at ECP’s after setting parking brake and placing the vehicle in park. The vehicle must be
   chocked immediately before starting FOD check. General purpose vehicles may be left
   running after setting parking brake, and placing in ―park‖ while conducting FOD checks
   prior to entry to the airfield.
4.5. Vehicle Speed Limits.
   4.5.1. General Speed Limits. The maximum speed limit for general purpose vehicles
   operating on airfield taxiways and runways is 25 mph. The maximum speed limit for general
   purpose vehicles on flight line road and the parking ramps/aprons is 15 mph. The maximum
   speed limit for airfield access and perimeter roads is 25 mph. The maximum speed limit in
   vehicle parking areas is 5 mph.
   4.5.2. Exceptions to speed limits include:
       4.5.2.1. Vehicles operating in close proximity to aircraft (within 25 feet) will not exceed
       5 mph.
       4.5.2.2. Special-purpose vehicles (e.g. tugs, forklifts, refueling vehicles, K-loaders) will
       not exceed 10 mph.
       4.5.2.3. All vehicles, within 10 feet of aircraft sunshades – 10 mph.
       4.5.2.4. Aircraft, equipment, and trailer towing:
           4.5.2.4.1. Towing speed is 5 mph for all aircraft and two or more maintenance
           stands. Towing speed for a single maintenance stand is 10 mph.
           4.5.2.4.2. The maximum towing speed for one piece of AGE (compressors, ground
           power units, oxygen carts, and similar equipment) is 15 mph.

   4.7.3. Vehicle/Aircraft Right of Way Procedures.
       4.7.3.1. When approaching or being approached by taxiing aircraft, exit taxiway/taxi
       lane or move from aircraft path at next paved surface until the aircraft is well clear of
       your vehicle (time permitting). Give way to aircraft by at least 50 feet. There are five
       taxiway pull-offs located along taxiway Alpha. They are used for vehicle traffic to allow
       25 feet minimum wing tip clearance for taxiing A-10, or smaller aircraft (See
       Attachment 10). If it is necessary to drive off the paved surface, the operator is
       responsible for checking the vehicle tires for FOD material and ensuring all tires and the
       paved surface are clear of FOD. This check will be accomplished immediately upon
       returning to the paved surface.
       4.7.3.2. Do not cross when an approaching aircraft is within 500 feet of your position, or
       until the aircraft has passed your position by at least 200 feet.
       4.7.3.3. Vehicles will not cross in front of an aircraft on hold unless signaled to do so by
       the pilot or instructed by the Control Tower via radio. Vehicle operators will never
       proceed between aircraft and personnel marshalling aircraft.
       4.7.3.4. Vehicles will remain at least 100 feet from any helicopter with its rotors in
       motion.

Paragraph 4.5.2.4 of this instruction.
4.9. Emergency Vehicle Operations. Vehicle operators will immediately yield the right-of-
way to emergency and fire/crash vehicles with rotating emergency lights in operation. Remain
clear of runway or taxiway access points until the emergency is terminated. Each emergency
response vehicle is required to request permission into the CMA via the Control Tower. It must
not be assumed that CMA access is allowed without specific permission from the Control Tower.
NOTE: The Fire Chief (Chief 1 or Chief 2 etc.) is allowed to request permission into the CMA
for additional crash vehicles.
4.10. AGE Operations.
   4.10.1. AGE equipment, electrical carts, forklifts, tow bars, fire extinguishers, maintenance
   stands, portable lighting and similar equipment (when not in use) will be removed from the
   aircraft parking area and stored in appropriate areas IAW Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-
   260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design. Designated AGE/Support Equipment
   storage have been established within a reasonable distance near every ramp. NOTE:
DAVISMONTHANAFBI13-213 4 APRIL 2011                                                              23

   behind the white lines to ensure at least 10 feet of wingtip clearance for aircraft taxiing on
   interior taxi lanes between the sunshades.
4.11. Restricted Visibility and Night Operations.
   4.11.1. In order to preserve aircrew night vision, during periods of darkness or reduced
   visibility, do not direct headlights toward the cockpit of an aircraft. Use parking lights to
   identify vehicle positions.
   4.11.2. Instrument Hold lines: Vehicles will stop and hold at INST marking/sign during In
   Flight Refueling (IFR) and low visibility conditions. Tower/Base Ops will broadcast when
   IFR conditions are in effect via the ramp net and tower net when conditions dictate.
   Broadcasts will be made in 30 minute increments for the first 2 hours.
   4.11.3. Vehicles parked on the airfield during hours of darkness or reduced visibility will use
   emergency flashers (hazard lights). Exception: specialized equipment (e.g. bomb loaders)
   not equipped with emergency warning flashers will be equipped with reflective markings
   during hours of darkness and inclement weather.
   4.11.4. Top-mounted rotating emergency lights must be in operation for vehicles routinely
   operating in the CMA. Emergency vehicles not operating in the CMA may be equipped with
   dash or grill mounted emergency lights. When emergency lighting devices are not available
   emergency flashers (hazard lights) will be used when operating in the CMA.
   4.11.5. Golf carts/electric cars not equipped with parking lights are exempt. However, golf
   carts/electric car operators should position their vehicles to prevent headlights from shining
   toward moving aircraft.
4.12. Daytime Running Lights. Vehicles equipped with daytime running lights will not shine
headlights directly toward aircraft during darkness/reduced visibility operations. Reposition
vehicle until the aircraft is out of range. If not possible, operators will immediately turn off the
ignition and turn on emergency flashers to identify position. Headlights will remain off until the
aircraft is out of range.
4.13. Control Tower Light Gun Signals
   4.13.1. All vehicle operators will be familiar/comply with airfield signs, markings, and
   Control Tower light gun signals.
   4.13.2. All vehicles operating on airfield will have AFVA 11-240 Airport Signs and
   Markings signal decal (See Figure 4.2). The decal may be permanently affixed in plain view
   of driver or clipped to inside of sun visor on driver’s side of vehicle so it can be flipped down
   for ready reference.

4.14. Description and Location of Runway/Taxiway Lighting, Markings and Signs.
   4.14.1. Runway Markings. Solid white lines running the length of the runway note the
   runway edge. Dashed white lines running down middle of the runway indicate the runway
   centerline. White numbers at the ends of each runway indicate the runway designation.
   4.14.2. Runway Lights. White and amber lights are located on the edges of runways. These
   high intensity lights run length of runway and identify runway edge.
   4.14.3. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Hold Position Markings. VFR hold positions are located
   at least 100 feet from the edge of runways on all taxiways leading to the runway. The
   markings consist of four parallel yellow stripes perpendicular to the axis of taxiway
   centerline (or runway edge), extending across the taxiway, including the shoulders (see
   Figure 4.3). The two stripes closest to the runway are dashed lines and other two are solid
   lines. These lines mark the boundary of the CMA. Vehicles will not cross runway hold
   positions or proceed onto the runway without obtaining permission from the Control Tower.

Figure 4.3. VFR Hold Position Markings.




   4.14.4. Instrument (INST) hold position markings. These lines are normally placed further
   away from the runway than the VFR hold position markings. These markings consist of two
   solid yellow lines, two feet apart, extending across width of taxiway, connected by pairs of
   solid yellow lines 10 feet apart, on black background (see Figure 4.4). INST Hold Positions
   will be used during IFR conditions or when directed by the Control Tower. These hold
   positions will be used any time the weather falls below a ceiling of 1,000 feet Above Ground
   Level (AGL) and/or visibility decreases to three statute miles or less.
