   of Survey (ROS).
   1.2. Each Squadron Commander is designated to review and sign DD Form 200 as the

     Officer (ACO) assigned to Contracting is designated as the Responsible Officer for any ROS

     responsible for providing guidance, maintaining records, and facilitating the ROS process
     through completion.
     1.4. Each Group Commander is designated as an Appointing Authority.
     1.5. The Installation Wing Commander is the designated Approving Authority. The Wing

2. Procedures.
     2.1. Within 45 days of the original discovery date that government property has been lost,
     damaged, or destroyed, the Equipment Custodian will provide the ROS Program Manager
     with a description (including serial or stock number) and cost of these items. Additionally, a
     point of contact should be identified for any further information that may be required. The
     Squadron Commander or Civilian Division Chief should be notified that a Report of Survey
     has been initiated. If the identified item is subsequently found, the ROS Program Manager
     should be notified immediately.

     Authority.
     2.3. The assigned ROS Investigator will conduct an impartial investigation and submit
     his/her findings and recommendations to the Responsible Officer within 55 days.
     Investigators should ensure that any individuals involved who may be held liable have been
     given the opportunity to review the case and to allow them to submit a written/verbal
     statement to refute the investigator’s findings and/or recommendations before the ROS is
     forwarded to the next level.
     2.4. The Responsible Officer will review the case and document his/her recommendations
     within 10 days. The case file will then be forwarded to the ROS Program Manager for
     further processing.
     2.5. The ROS Program Manager will coordinate with the appropriate accountable officer
     (either Materiel Management [LGS], Civil Engineer [CE], Transportation [LGT], or 910th
     Communications Flight [CF]) to ensure records are adjusted within 5 days.
     2.6. The Appointing Official will have 15 days to process the ROS action. This will be
     extended by 40 days for legal review if required, and an additional 60 days if a Financial
     Liability Officer is appointed.
     2.7. At the conclusion of all ROS actions, including any legal and financial liability reviews,
     the case file is forwarded to the Approving Official who shall determine final disposition of

     responsibility.

     acknowledgement to the individual charged, who is advised that the ROS action may be
