                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. Pilot in Command Authority. The Pilot in Command (PIC) is responsible for, and is
   the final authority as to, the operation of the aircraft.
   1.1.2. This instruction is a common source of flight directives that includes:
       1.1.2.1. Air Force-specific guidance, and
       1.1.2.2. Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFRs) (formerly the Federal Aviation
       Regulations), the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), and
       1.1.2.3. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended
       Practices (SARPs).
   1.1.3. This AFI provides necessarily broad guidance and cannot address every conceivable
   circumstance. PICs will use their orders and best judgment to safely conduct the flight.
   1.1.4. Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) or Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Applicability.
   With respect to compliance with flight rules, the USAF considers UAS/RPA to be no
   different than manned aircraft. Groups 4 and 5 RPA operations shall follow this AFI, while
   Groups 1-3 (―Small‖) UAS shall be governed by AFPD 11-5, Small Unmanned Aircraft
   Systems Rules, Procedures, and Service, and its derivative instructions.
1.2. Compliance. The PIC will ensure compliance with this AFI and the following:
   1.2.1. MAJCOM guidance and MDS-specific instructions, manuals and supplements.
   1.2.2. The specific rules of each individual nation as published in Flight Information
   Publications (FLIP) planning documents and the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG). Theater
   commanders must ensure the contents of FLIP accurately indicate the rules of each nation
   within their area of responsibility that differ from this instruction.
   1.2.3. Procedures and special notices in FLIP, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), aircraft
   technical orders, Air Force directives, MAJCOM directives, and Air Traffic Control (ATC)
   instructions. (See Attachment 1 for related publications.)
   1.2.4. Combatant Commander's Special Instructions (SPINS), theater operational
   procedures, Air Tasking Orders, Airspace Control Orders, Air Operations Center
   instructions, and other associated directives IAW the Air Component Commander's
   objectives.
1.3. Operational Prerogative of Military Aircraft. In international airspace, when
operationally necessary, PIC's are authorized to conduct military flight operations with due
regard for the safety of navigation of civil traffic in accordance with (IAW) FLIP GP
―Operations and Firings over the High Seas.‖ Except for pre-planned missions, PIC's shall
consider such operations, in peacetime, as a flight rule deviation and will comply with the
reporting requirements in paragraph 1.7. MAJCOMs may authorize tactical operations for
training and to comply with paragraph 1.2.4.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                            11


1.3. (USAFE)Operational Prerogative of Military Aircraft. USAFE authorizes tactical
operations for training and to comply with paragraph 1.2.4 during Due Regard IAW AFI 11-
2MDSV3 and local guidance or MDS-specific AFTTPs.
1.4. MAJCOM Supplements and Command Relationships. The following restrictions apply
to MAJCOM supplements and MDS Specific, Volume 3 instructions subordinate to this AFI.
   1.4.1. MAJCOM guidance, in any form, unless specifically permitted, shall not be less
   restrictive than this instruction.
   1.4.2. Items in this AFI delineating MAJCOM responsibilities will be addressed in a
   MAJCOM supplement, the lead command-authored AFI 11-2MDS Volume 3, MDS
   Operations Procedures, or other published MAJCOM guidance.
   1.4.3. Lead and user MAJCOMs are not bound by, or authorized to operate under, the
   other’s waivers or exemptions.
   1.4.4. MAJCOM supplements to this instruction and MDS Specific, Volume 3 instructions
   must be coordinated through HQ AFFSA for USAF/A3O approval prior to publication IAW
   AFPD 11-2. Submit supplements for coordination to: HQ AFFSA/A3OF (AJW31AF),
   Building 4, Room 124, 6500 South MacArthur Blvd, Oklahoma City, OK 73169, (405) 739-
   9637, DSN 339-9637, email: hqaffsa.a3of@tinker.af.mil.
   1.4.4. (USAFE) Unit supplements to include supplements to AFI 11-2MDSV3, must be
   coordinated with HQ USAFE/A3TV prior to publication. Forward all request for
   coordination to the ―USAFE/A3TV (Workflow)‖ organizational (org) account NLT one
   month prior to desired suspense date.
1.5. Title 14 CFR Exemptions and FAA Authorizations. MAJCOMs will obtain FAA
exemptions or authorizations only through HQ USAF/A3O by contacting HQ AFFSA and
following the waiver guidance below. MAJCOMs should submit their CFR Exemption requests
a minimum of six months prior to execution for original requests and exemption renewals.
EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 13-201, Airspace Management, waivers for airshow issues (speed,
minimum safe altitudes, parachute jumping, etc.) should be submitted directly to the local Flight
Standards District Office. Operations of UAS in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS)
outside of Warning and Restricted Areas require an FAA Certificate of Authorization or Waiver
(COA), to be obtained by the user unit through their MAJCOM.
1.6. Waivers. HQ USAF/A3O will provide waivers to this instruction only upon an official
MAJCOM request when an essential requirement makes a waiver necessary or compliance with
a flight rule creates a hazard.
   1.6.1. Waiver Process. HQ USAF/A3O will provide only written waivers with an
   expiration date. Revisions to this AFI do not automatically invalidate current waivers with
   respect to paragraph numbering, etc. Upon publication of a revision, HQ AFFSA shall
   coordinate with each MAJCOM to convert, rescind, or issue new waivers (when appropriate)
   resulting from revisions to this AFI. Units requiring a waiver to this AFI will follow this
   procedure:
       1.6.1.1. Units will forward their written request for a waiver to this instruction through
       their chain of command to the MAJCOM/A3. The unit’s detailed waiver request must
12                    AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


     clearly delineate if a FAA exemption is required, the operational requirement for the
     waiver and risk mitigation measures to be undertaken during operations under the waiver.
     1.6.1.2. MAJCOMs will review the request. If approved, the MAJCOM/A3 will endorse
     the request and forward it in memo or message format to HQ USAF/A3O, with a copy to
     HQ AFFSA/A3O, at least 30 days prior to the waiver requirement (if waiver also requires
     FAA exemption, see paragraph 1.5).                  Submit waiver requests to:
     afa3o.workflow@pentagon.af.mil (copy to: hqaffsa.a3of@tinker.af.mil). If approved,
     HQ USAF/A3O will send an approved waiver memo to the MAJCOM/A3.                    HQ
     USAF/A3O will review and respond in writing to all MAJCOM waiver requests.
     1.6.1.3. MAJCOMs shall track the currency of all approved waivers to ensure renewals,
     if required, are validated and then requested using the process above at least 15 days prior
     to the expiration date. HQ AFFSA retains renewal authority for existing waivers.
     Renewals should be requested by the MAJCOM Stan/Eval function.

       1.6.2.1. MAJCOM commanders may unilaterally authorize any deviation from air traffic
       rules (this instruction, the CFRs, etc.), without prior approval from HQ USAF/A3O or the
       FAA, if doing so is ―essential to the defense of the United States‖ because of a military
       emergency or an urgent military necessity, and there is no time to obtain prior approval
       from HQ USAF/A3O or the FAA. Time permitting, the MAJCOM will notify HQ
       USAF/A3O (copy to HQ AFFSA) and the FAA (through HQ AFFSA) of its military
       intentions prior to deviating from the flight rules. MAJCOM commanders will notify HQ
       USAF/A3O within 72 hours of authorizing any waiver or deviation following the process
       in paragraph 1.6.1.2. Notification must include details of the waiver action to include
       expected date of return to normal operations.
       1.6.2.1. (USAFE) Units will obtain COMUSAFE approval for waivers IAW the
       following guidance (reference paragraph 1.6.1.4 (Added)):
           1.6.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Written approval. If time and conditions permit submit
           request IAW paragraph 1.6.1.6.1 As much as practical, staff waiver requests so as to
           arrive at USAFE/A3T at least 10 business days prior to when the waiver is needed.

                               PREFLIGHT REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Preflight Planning. Before takeoff, the PIC will ensure the entire mission is planned to its
final destination in the greatest detail possible for each leg of the flight. For multi-leg flights,
before each departure, the PIC will obtain the latest weather and NOTAM information available
for the departure airfield, intended route, destination and alternate. The PIC will ensure aircrew
members know the appropriate procedures and have applicable information available to them for
the intended operation. These shall include, but are not limited to:
   2.1.1. Appropriate sections of the aircraft technical order (T.O.).
   2.1.2. NOTAMs (including Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) NOTAMs, and navigation
   database NOTAMS (e.g. Jeppesen NAVDATA), if applicable) and Temporary Flight
   Restrictions (TFRs).
   2.1.2. (USAFE) Prior to all flights within the USAFE AOR and when operating from
   locations not having a DoD NOTAM service, aircrew will reference the applicable HN
   NOTAM service to include low-level NOTAMs if provided. If the HN does not provide a
   NOTAM service, obtain required NOTAM information by whatever means available. For
   UK-specific low-level operations, aircrew will also ensure they are familiar with any
   affecting UK ―Royal‖ Flights (contact 48 OSS/OSO, 48oss.oso@lakenheath.af.mil, DSN
   314-226-3682).
   2.1.3. FLIP including appropriate sectional aeronautical charts, oceanic plotting charts or
   Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS)/Falcon View charts with FAA/ICAO airspace
   displayed for flight under Visual Flight Rules (VFR).
   2.1.4. Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) including Supplemental Theater
   Information File (STIF), Special Departure Procedure (SDP) information and approved
   private vendor flight publications information IAW paragraph 2.2.
   2.1.5. Alternatives available if the flight cannot be completed as planned.
   2.1.6. Departure, en route, destination, and alternate weather observations and forecasts.
   2.1.7. Fuel requirements.
   2.1.8. Minimum safe altitudes and terrain type for the planned route and terminal areas.
   2.1.9. Takeoff and landing limitations, including low-visibility operations.
   2.1.10. AFI 11-2MDS-Specific, Volume 3, MDS Operations Procedures.

   2.1.14. Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) if any portion of the flight is to
   be conducted using GPS as primary source of navigation. See also paragraph 2.16.
2.2. Airfield Suitability.
   2.2.1. Each MAJCOM will establish MDS-specific guidance on how aircrews, mission
   planners and other personnel will access, use and employ ASRR/STIF, SDP and Jeppesen
   Military Chart Service information.
       2.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Aircrews will comply with the ASRR/STIF. Current ASRR
       information is available on GDSS2 (https://gdss2.c2.amc.af.mil/) and supersedes FLIP
       data (see paragraph 2.2.2 for guidance on gaining access to the ASRR). Additional
       information for an airfield may be added/deleted to the STIF by contacting HQ
       USAFE/A3TV (usafe.a3tv@ramstein.af.mil). IAW ASRR general guidance,
       USAFE/A3TV will work with the HQ AMC Airfield Suitability office to modify STIF
       information as needed.
       2.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) USAFE fixed-wing aircraft may operate only at airfields that
       are listed as suitable in the ASRR/GDSS airfield data base. Aircraft that are not
       specifically mentioned will comply with non-aircraft specific restrictions (e.g. ―Day
       Only‖). HQ USAFE/A3T is the waiver authority for ASRR restrictions (see paragraph
       1.6.1.4 (Added)).
       2.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Airfields not contained in the ASRR/GDSS airfield database
       are considered unsuitable for aircraft operating USAFE missions. Exception: USAFE and
       USAFE-gained C-130 missions may operate at unimproved landing zones not contained
       in the ASRR/GDSS airfield database IAW AFI 11-2C130JV3 and Zone Availability
       Report (ZAR) guidance.
           2.2.1.3.1. (Added-USAFE) If mission requirements dictate operating into an airfield
           not contained in the ASRR/GDSS airfield database, the mission planning agency will
           contact the HQ AMC Airfield Suitability Office (see paragraph 2.2.2) to request a
           suitability determination. The airfield will be added to the ASRR/GDSS airfield
           database once HQ AMC completes the requested review.
   2.2.2. SDP and Jeppesen Military Chart Service (or other approved private vendor)
   information are available at commercial websites. The MAJCOM Standardization and
   Evaluation office may obtain usernames and passwords from HQ AFFSA/A3OF. Contact
   AMC Airfield Suitability office (DSN 779-3112 or airfield.helpdesk@amc.af.mil) for
   access to the ASRR.
   2.2.2. (USAFE) Individual aircrew will contact their OGVs who will, in turn, request
   assistance as required from HQ USAFE/A3TV to meet AFI 11-2MDSV3 SDP and Jeppesen
   Military Chart Service information requirements.
       2.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) HN/foreign IAPs that have been reviewed by TERPS may be
       found at the following link: https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a36a/web/procedures.htm.
       For all other HN/foreign IAPs, aircrew MUST ensure the procedure has a current TERPS
       review prior to use (see paragraph 8.4.5.4 (Added)).
2.3. Publications. Operational commanders are responsible for providing their crews with
access to appropriate flight publications. Aircrew members shall not be provided with, nor use,
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                               17


any publication in-flight which is out of date, incomplete, illegible or contains unfamiliar
procedures or a language barrier.
2.3. (USAFE) Publications. Units may use out of date FLIP for ground training/testing only
(e.g. IRC). For simulators, units will ensure the most current FLIP is used based on the software
loaded in the SIM (e.g. if new FLIP contains a procedure that is not supported by the current sim
software, the most current version of FLIP that is supported will be used). In all cases out-of-date
publications must be clearly marked ―For Ground Training Use Only‖ or ―For Training Use
Only‖.
   2.3.1. The PIC will ensure current copies (electronic and/or paper) of the appropriate FLIP
   en route supplement, en route, oceanic plotting and/or terrain charts, Flight Information
   Handbook, and appropriate arrival, approach and departure procedures are on board the
   aircraft or immediately available in the UAS control station. If an electronic navigation
   system database is used, the PIC will ensure it is current. For Electronic Flight Bag (EFB)
   and paperless cockpit restrictions, see paragraph 2.17.
   2.3.2. Printed forms, charts or terminal procedures, used for en route or off-station
   navigation, must be printed in the original scale and in color (if appropriate), and be current
   with the latest Digital Aeronautical Information File (DAFIF) and Electronic Chart Update
   Manual (ECHUM). MAJCOMs may permit additional chart configurations to meet mission-
   specific needs.
   2.3.2. (USAFE) Obtaining ECHUM for HN chart updating will be accomplished using the
   Chart Amendment Document (CHAD), UK Chart Amendment Low Fly (CALF), Manual
   Boat (Low Flying Manual Italy), or HN-equivalent that provides chart update information.
       2.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Unless otherwise stipulated in AFI 11-2MDSV3, all obstacles
       within 200 feet of the lowest planned altitude inside the planned low-level/VFR-
       navigation route/area will be updated and highlighted.
       2.3.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Charts will also be updated with current applicable HN low-
       level NOTAM info (see paragraph 2.1.2 (USAFE)). NOTE: German CHUM (CHAD-
       GER) does not account for wind power plants (i.e. windmills) below 100m (approx 328
       feet). The location and elevation of these obstructions can usually be found in the Flight
       Safety NOTAMs for the applicable Flight Information Region (FIR). However, if a
       German military aerodrome owns the obstruction, the location and elevation of the
       obstruction may be found in the Flight Safety NOTAMs for that aerodrome.
   2.3.3. Aircrews will obtain FLIP and aeronautical navigation data (including charts) only
   from US Government sources. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) data may be
   obtained at https://www.extranet.nga.mil.        US Government Terminal Procedures
   Publications (approach, departure charts and airfield diagrams, etc.) and an Aeronautical
   Chart Users Guide are available at: http://www.naco.faa.gov. See paragraph 8.4.5. for non-
   US Government procedure use rules.
   2.3.3. (USAFE) Products printed directly from the NGA and NACO websites automatically
   have a ―Valid Through‖ date included. If FLIP is reproduced and does not include a ―Valid
   Through‖ date, one will be included on every product used in-flight.
 18                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


   2.3.4. (Added-USAFE) Aircrew will use HN Special Aeronautical Charts (SAC) as the
   primary source of planning and in-flight information for low altitude navigation where SAC
   coverage exists (SACs included both LFCs [1:500,000] and TFCs [1:250,000]). For all low-
   level missions executed in the USAFE AOR, a hard copy version of the LFC and/or TFC will
   be available during flight IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3 low-level navigation guidance. The hard-
   copy chart must be one of the following:
       2.3.4.1. (Added-USAFE) An original or copy of a HN LFC/TFC.
       2.3.4.2. (Added-USAFE) A HN LFC/TFC printed from AFI 11-2MDSV3-approved
       mission planning software or the NGA ―Mission Planning‖ website
       (https://dbgia.geointel.nga.mil/index.cfm).
2.4. Fuel Requirements. The PIC will ensure sufficient fuel is available on board the aircraft to
comply with the requirements of this instruction and safely conduct the flight. PICs shall use
MAJCOM-approved fuel-efficiency techniques and procedures to the maximum extent practical.
Before takeoff or immediately after in-flight refueling, the aircraft must have enough usable fuel
aboard to complete the flight:
2.4. (USAFE) Fuel Requirements. Aircrew will use the fuel-efficiency techniques as
published in AFI 11-2MDSV3 and local guidance.
   2.4.1. To a final landing, either at the destination airport or alternate airport (if one is
   required), plus the fuel reserves.
   2.4.2. To or between Air Refueling Control Points (ARCPs) and then to land at the
   destination (or a recovery base, if refueling is not successful), plus the fuel reserve.
   2.4.3. Alternate Airport Required. When an alternate is required, the weather conditions
   at the original destination govern the preflight fuel computation.
       2.4.3.1. Fuel required for an approach and missed approach must be included in the total
       flight plan fuel if visibility-only weather criteria (paragraph 8.6.3.2.) is used to determine
       the suitability of the original destination.
       2.4.3.2. Fuel required for an approach and missed approach is not required if the ceiling
       and visibility criteria is used to determine the suitability of the original destination.
       2.4.3.2. (USAFE) Fighter aircraft fuel requirements must include the fuel needed for an
       approach and missed approach at the original destination, even if ceiling and visibility
       criteria are used to determine suitability of the original destination.
       2.4.3.3. (Added-USAFE) See paragraph 8.8.3 (Added) for fuel requirements when
       operating under the dual alternate concept.
   2.4.4. Fuel Reserve. The PIC must ensure the aircraft is carrying enough usable fuel on
   each flight to increase the total planned flight time between refueling points by 10 percent
   (up to a maximum of 45 minutes for fixed-wing or 30 minutes for helicopters) or 20 minutes,
   whichever is greater. Compute fuel reserves using MAJCOM-defined consumption rates for
   normal cruising speeds or the following:
       2.4.4.1. For reciprocating engine aircraft and helicopters, use fuel consumption rates for
       normal cruising altitudes.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                            19


       2.4.4.2. For turbine-powered aircraft use fuel consumption rates that provide maximum
       endurance at 10,000 ft. Mean Sea Level (MSL).
       2.4.4.3. If the MAJCOM authorizes holding (instead of an alternate airport) for a remote
       or island destination, do not consider the prescribed holding time as part of the total
       planned flight time for computing fuel reserve.
       2.4.4.3. (USAFE) Reference paragraph 8.7.3 for USAFE guidance on holding-in-lieu-
       of-alternate for remote/island destinations.
   2.4.5. Extended Operations (ETOPS). In the absence of MDS-specific guidance, PICs of
   USAF multi-engine aircraft operated for extended periods over large bodies of water (outside
   gliding distance to a suitable landing site) or desolate land areas shall, during preflight
   planning, calculate and plot on the appropriate navigational chart, an Equal Time Point (ETP)
   to a suitable alternate for that mission leg, and specifically plan contingency fuel
   requirements (e.g.: engine-out depressurized flight at an appropriate altitude from ETP to the
   suitable landing site).
   2.4.5. (USAFE) Extended Operations (ETOPS). ETOPS guidance does not apply to
   tactical operations conducted over open water where fuel planning for a return to the primary
   recovery base or recovery at an alternate (if necessary) is already factored into the mission.
       2.4.5.1. (Added-USAFE) MAF.         Follow AFI 11-2MDSV3 guidance on ETP
       calculations (reference also AFMAN 11-217V1).
       2.4.5.2. (Added-USAFE) CAF. For ACC/AOS-controlled flights (e.g. CORONET),
       the preflight planning and products produced by the applicable AOS suffice for the
       requirements listed above. When not under AOS control, follow MDS and local
       standards for maintaining awareness of divert options while on extended-duration flights
       (see also paragraph 8.7.2.5 (Added)). Reference AFMAN 11-217V3 for further
       information on calculating ETPs.
   2.4.6. Minimum/Emergency Fuel Advisory. Pilots will declare minimum/emergency fuel
   to the appropriate controlling agency when in their judgment the aircraft may land at the
   intended destination with less than the minimum/emergency fuel reserve.
2.5. Flight Logs. When required by the MAJCOM, PIC’s will ensure the flight log documents
appropriate air navigation, oceanic crossing, and fuel planning information. The lead command
will approve flight-planning software to meet MDS training and operational requirements.
Approved flight logs include: AF Form 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight Log, Navigator’s
flight log, a MAJCOM-approved computer-generated flight log or form, or flight planning
computations annotated on a navigation chart.
2.5. (USAFE) Flight Logs. Flight log documentation will be IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3 and local
guidance.
2.6. Weather. For authorized weather sources, refer to AFH 11-203V2, Weather for Aircrews,
the Flight Information Handbook (FIH) or use a published MAJCOM-approved source. If
unable to obtain weather information, pilots may fly in VMC to a point where contact may be
established with an authorized weather source.
2.6. (USAFE) Weather. In addition to the above resources, for official pre-flight weather
planning, USAFE aircrew may use the following sources, all other sources will be for reference

only (to the max extent practical, reference the servicing OWA’s information first). Units will
publish guidance on the documentation of weather brief completion.
   2.6.1. (Added-USAFE) HN weather sources as endorsed by the home base US military
   weather office or servicing Operational Weather Squadron (OWS).
   2.6.2. (Added-USAFE) All sources as specifically stated in MDS-specific and local
   guidance.
2.7. Briefings. Prior to flight, the PIC must ensure each crewmember and passenger is briefed
on items affecting safety or mission completion. At a minimum, briefings will include:
   2.7.1. Emergency procedures.
   2.7.2. Aircrew and Passenger flight equipment/systems usage information (see para. 6.2.).
   2.7.3. Safety precautions and restrictions (including electronic device prohibitions).
   2.7.4. Special procedures and instructions for use during training, formation, or operational
   missions.
2.8. Printed Information Guides. Lead commands will supplement verbal briefings with
printed information guides for passenger use according to DoD 4515.13-R on all aircraft
designated as passenger-carrying. Printed guides do not substitute for verbal briefings.
MAJCOMs may exempt aircraft from this requirement if the printed guides create a safety
hazard.
2.8. (USAFE) Printed Information Guides. Units operating passenger-carrying aircraft will
provide passenger information cards IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3. If no guidance exists, use the
following:
   2.8.1. (Added-USAFE) Provide passenger-information cards for each forward or rear
   facing passenger seat and one passenger information card for every five aisle facing
   passenger seats. C-130 and HH-60 aircraft are exempted from this guidance.
2.9. Electronic Devices. The PIC will prohibit the use of any device suspected of creating
interference with any system on the aircraft. Devices that transmit through an antenna are
prohibited from use during all phases of flight except as noted below. For the purposes of this
AFI, characteristics of ―portable‖ devices include items that: cannot be installed as standard
equipment, are carried/loaded onto the aircraft prior to flight, are removed after the flight is
completed, and the extent of the electrical interface with the aircraft is at most electrical power
and a data interface port (such as RJ-45). Lead or user MAJCOMs shall ensure that required
testing is conducted IAW MIL-STD 464 and MIL HANDBOOK 516. The following
prohibitions apply to each passenger and crewmember aboard a USAF aircraft or UAS control
station:
   2.9.1. Cellular Phones. The PIC will ensure that cellular phones, pagers, wireless internet
   capable devices and similar cell phone technology devices are turned off and stowed from the
   time the aircraft leaves its parking spot for departure until clear of the runway after landing.
   2.9.2. Medical Equipment. Normally, only medical equipment referenced in the aircraft
   flight manual or AFI 11-2MDS series is permitted. The 77 AESG/TFL Aeromedical Test
   Branch is responsible for certifying medical equipment for flight from both aircraft and
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                             21


  patient safety standpoints. Their contact information is as follows: 77 AESG/TFL, 7980
  Lindberg Landing, Brooks-City Base TX 78235-5104, DSN 240-1187.
  2.9.3. Portable Non-transmitting Devices Authorized Anytime. The following devices
  that do not transmit a signal through an antenna may be used at any time: hearing aids, heart
  pacemakers, watches, hand-held calculators, electric shavers, and equipment certified IAW
  paragraph 2.9.6. Personal camera use is prohibited during solo flight.
  2.9.3. (USAFE) Portable Non-transmitting Devices Authorized Anytime. This guidance
  does not preclude the use of issued cameras by fighter aircrew during operational air defense
  missions in support of NATO Air Policing. Under these circumstances, fighter aircrew will
  only use issued cameras for mission-essential tasks.
     2.9.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Only qualified aircrew, combat camera personnel, and
     WG/CC-approved news media representatives will be permitted to carry personal
     cameras in the cockpit of fighter aircraft.
     2.9.3.2. (Added-USAFE) In addition to the above guidance, aircrew may use personal
     cameras in flight subject to the following constraints:
         2.9.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The pilot flying the aircraft must be current and
         qualified in that aircraft and crew position.
         2.9.3.2.2. (Added-USAFE) The individual using the camera will not also be
         actively flying the aircraft.
         2.9.3.2.3. (Added-USAFE) While cameras are in use, only formation positions IAW
         AFI11-2MDSV3 and MDS-specific AFTTP guidance are permitted.
  2.9.4. Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). The following conditions apply to
  the use of electronic devices other than cellular phones during flight in IMC:
     2.9.4.1. Portable Transmitting Devices. Portable transmitting devices such as hand-
     held radios and satellite phones not certified as part of the aircraft equipment shall not be
     operated at any time when in IMC.
     2.9.4.2. Portable Non-transmitting Devices above 10,000 ft. Above Ground Level
     (AGL). The PIC may authorize the use of: audio-visual recorders, digital cameras,
     computers and their peripherals, electronic entertainment devices, and antenna-connected
     receivers.
     2.9.4.3. Portable Non-Transmitting Devices below 10,000 ft. AGL. All devices that
     do not transmit through an antenna may be operated below 10,000 foot AGL when in
     IMC only when they have been certified as safe-to-fly IAW 2.9.6. The responsible
     AFMC aircraft program office must authorize the use of devices under this paragraph
     through the AF Form 1067 submittal process for flight authorization.
  2.9.5. Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). MAJCOMs may approve the use of
  portable transmitting devices (other than cell phones) such as hand-held radios and satellite
  phones during flights in VMC if there is a valid operational need that cannot be met by any
  other means. MAJCOMs shall ensure that testing is conducted IAW MIL-STD 464 and MIL
  HANDBOOK 516 and will advise HQ AFFSA/A3O of any authorization provided under this
  paragraph. During VMC flight (other than takeoff or landing) the PIC may authorize the use
 22                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


   of the following non-transmitting devices: audio-visual recorders, digital cameras,
   computers and their peripherals, electronic entertainment devices, and antenna-connected
   receivers.
   2.9.5. (USAFE) Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). During VMC operations,
   portable transmitting device use (other than cell phones) will be IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3.
   Portable GPS devices that do not have a radio transmit capability are considered ―antenna-
   connected receivers‖ and may be used IAW paragraph 2.9.5.
   2.9.6. Testing Requirements. Devices that are not authorized for flight in the above
   paragraphs must be tested in accordance with MIL-STD-461F, ―Requirements for the
   Control of Electromagnetic Interference Characteristics of Subsystems and Equipment,‖ to
   determine their suitability for use in flight. Technical guidance, advice on testing
   capabilities, and assessment of test results are the responsibility ASC/ENAD, 2530 Loop
   Road West, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7101, DSN 785-8928 or 785-2860, email:
   afi11-202.emi.cert@wpafb.af.mil. ASC/ENAD maintains a General Certification Letter
   that lists devices of general interest that have been evaluated for flight. This letter is
   available at: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-EN-AS-14
2.10. International Destinations. The PIC will comply with international procedures in FLIP
GP, Area Planning (AP), and the FCG. See paragraph 2.16 and AFMAN 11-217, Volume 3, for
supplemental information on oceanic flight.
2.10. (USAFE)International Destinations. For oceanic flight, in addition to referencing
information and checklists in AFMAN 11-217V3, Chapter 13, aircrew will reference the
Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications (MNPS) manual and checklists found on the
DINS NOTAMS website (https://www.notams.jcs.mil) under the ICAO links on the right hand
side of the page. As a rule, whenever the MNPS manual uses ―should‖, USAFE crews will
interpret this as ―shall.‖ Reference paragraph 2.16.5 for more MNPS guidance.
   2.10.1. The PIC shall enhance pre- and post-flight aircraft checks on all flights with a
   destination other than the country of departure. Checks will include the manifest of all
   personnel, cargo and likely areas aboard the aircraft where drugs, contraband, stowaways or
   other illegal substances may be concealed.
   2.10.2. Immediately report any suspected customs, agriculture or immigration violations to
   the proper authorities.
2.11. Mountainous Terrain. In the absence of other MAJCOM guidance, USAF aircrews shall
consider as mountainous: those areas defined in 14 CFR §95.11 for CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii
and Puerto Rico. For all other areas of operation, use a 500 ft surface elevation change over a ½
NM distance to define the location of mountainous terrain.
2.11. (USAFE) Mountainous Terrain. For flight operations outside the NAS, USAFE/A3
waives all definitions of ―mountainous terrain‖ in applicable AFI 11-2MDSV3s in lieu of
paragraph 2.11. When flying within the NAS, aircrew will follow 14 CFR §95.11 (link:
CONUS Mountainous Terrain Chart).
   2.11.1. (Added-USAFE) The ―500’ over 1/2NM‖ calculation (which equates to a 10º climb
   gradient) is based on terrain contour lines as depicted on an approved low-level navigation
   chart. The ―1/2NM‖ is not from a course line or present aircraft position.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                             23


   2.11.2. (Added-USAFE) Units are permitted to create ―mountainous terrain‖ overlays on
   approved low-level navigation charts as mission planning aids that depict areas of terrain that
   fall within the ―500’ over 1/2NM‖ definition.
2.12. Hazardous Cargo. The PIC must ensure compliance with AFJI 11-204, Operational
Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials.
2.13. Transport of Drugs. The PIC will not allow the transport of narcotics, marijuana,
controlled substances or other dangerous drugs on USAF aircraft unless such transport has been
pre-approved by a US Military, Federal, or State authority.
2.14. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Hazards. MAJCOMs will provide guidance for aircrew
and passengers to ensure the wearing of jewelry (or other personal accoutrements) aboard the
aircraft, in a UAS control station and on the flight line do not create a FOD hazard.
2.14. (USAFE) Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Hazards. FOD prevention for aircrew and
passengers is IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3 guidance. Passenger service representatives/aircrew
members are responsible for briefing passengers on FOD prevention measures prior to enplaning
or deplaning. In the event that any personal items are unaccounted for, refer to local procedures
for reporting possible FOD to maintenance personnel.
2.15. Equipment Required for Flight. USAF aircraft cockpits and RPA control stations must
always provide full-time attitude, altitude, and airspeed information and the capability to
recognize, confirm, and recover from unusual attitudes in all pilot positions.
   2.15.1. Flight Instrumentation. Lead commands will define display requirements for
   aircraft not certified or authorized for instrument flight. Displays must always be positioned
   and arranged in a manner to enable an effective crosscheck. UAS ground stations must
   provide the pilot equivalent information appropriate to the system’s autonomy. HQ
   USAF/A3O is the final authority and must endorse electronic and single medium displays
   and standby or emergency instruments as a Primary Flight Reference (PFR) before the
   instruments are used as a stand-alone reference for instrument flight. HQ AFFSA must
   evaluate any changes to cockpit instrumentation. The following instrumentation must always
   be displayed to the pilot (and illuminated during night operations) in USAF cockpits and
   UAS ground stations:
       2.15.1.1. Climb/Dive Angle (or pitch and vertical velocity)
       2.15.1.2. Bank Angle
       2.15.1.3. Barometric Altitude
       2.15.1.4. Indicated or Calibrated Airspeed
       2.15.1.5. Prominent Horizon Reference
       2.15.1.6. Heading
       2.15.1.7. Appropriate fault indications (off flags) for instruments, PFRs and UAS lost
       communication links must be operative.
   2.15.2. Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). Flights in IMC also require
   operational: pitot heat, anti-icing and/or de-icing equipment designed to cope with the type
   and severity of known or forecast icing conditions. Such equipment is not required for brief
 24                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


   exposures when climbing or descending to an operating altitude above or below the icing
   condition.
   2.15.3. Night Flight. (N/A for UAS operations) In addition to the requirements of
   paragraphs 5.12. and 5.20., a pilot must not operate an aircraft at night unless it is equipped
   with cockpit lighting sufficient to allow crewmembers to view required instrument panels,
   controls, and read required charts, FLIP, instrument approach plates and other navigation
   materials. Each crewmember must have an operable flashlight.
       2.15.3.1. Use an authorized weather source, the latest version of the Air Almanac,
       MAJCOM-approved computer program or US Naval Observatory data to determine and
       calculate light and moon data. See glossary for definitions of night and civil twilight.
       2.15.3.1. (USAFE) For official flight planning purposes, aircrew may use programs as
       allowed in MDS-specific and local guidance/standards. All other sources may be used for
       reference only.
   2.15.4. Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) Equipment Requirements. RPAs must meet
   equipage requirements for the class of airspace for which they intend to operate. If not
   suitably equipped, the RPA may only be flown in appropriate special-use airspace or under
   the provisions of a COA.
2.16. Communications, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM)
Systems and Procedures. For flights that operate under instrument flight rules (IFR), the
aircraft must have a two-way radio and navigation equipment compatible with the airspace
where the operations occur. IAW AFPD 63-13, CNS/ATM and Navigation Safety Performance
for USAF Aircraft, CNS/ATM and navigation safety systems integrated on USAF aircraft must
provide an equivalent level of performance and safety to civil standards. The lead MAJCOM
and system developer ensures the aircraft is properly certified and operationally approved before
use.
   2.16.1. Certification. The term ―properly certified‖ indicates that performance of the
   aircraft systems has been assessed IAW AFI 63-1301, Assurance of CNS/ATM and
   Navigation Safety Performance, to ensure compliance with paragraph 2.15. and this section.
   Civil standards may be obtained from the HQ AFFSA/A3ON Community of Practice web
   site at: https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/affsa-a3on, or via aircraft certification matrices
   maintained by 853 ELSG/NT (https://igatm.hanscom.af.mil).
   2.16.2. Operational approval. Lead MAJCOMs approve operational use of CNS/ATM and
   navigation safety systems. MAJCOMs shall ensure that required aircrew and maintainer
   proficiency and training is maintained and documented, and that flight manuals, technical
   orders, and operating instructions are updated to include appropriate procedures and
   information on CNS/ATM use and functions. MAJCOMs must provide explicit guidance to
   aircrews defining what capabilities, qualifications, and restrictions apply to installed
   CNS/ATM equipment on all applicable MDSs, to include remote/oceanic operations (i.e.,
   GPS primary means, MNPS, RNP 10, RNP 4, etc), RNAV en route, terminal, and approach
   operations (i.e., Baro-VNAV, RNAV 2, RNAV 5/B-RNAV, RNAV 1/P-RNAV, etc),
   RVSM, etc. MAJCOMs should provide standard operating procedures for flight in oceanic
   (or applicable MNPS) airspace, including checklists for inflight use, as necessary.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                          25


  2.16.2. (USAFE) Operational approval. CNS/ATM operations, training, and documentation
  as directed in paragraph 2.16.2 shall be IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3.
  2.16.3. Navigation Specification. Aircraft must meet the navigation specification of the
  airspace or procedure being flown. Specific performance infrastructure requirements are
  defined for each navigation specification. An aircraft approved for a RNP or RNAV
  specification having a stringent accuracy requirement is not automatically approved for a
  navigation specification having a less stringent requirement (e.g., RNP 0.3 or RNAV 1 does
  not imply RNP 4 or RNAV 5 compliance) because different navigation specifications have
  different performance, equipage and infrastructure assumptions.
  2.16.4. GPS/RNAV Equipment. Air Force GPS/RNAV systems are divided into three
  basic categories: portable GPS units, mission enhancement systems and systems meeting
  FAA requirements for IFR use.
     2.16.4.1. Portable GPS Units (PGUs). PGUs include commercial hand-held GPS
     receivers, military precision lightweight GPS receivers (PLGRs), and PLGRs coupled
     with a laptop computer that incorporates moving map displays. They are intended to be
     used in aircraft as situational awareness tools only. MAJCOMs shall publish guidance on
     the use of PGUs, approve their software and develop programs to ensure aircrews receive
     proper training on these systems before permitting their use. PGUs are authorized for use
     with the following restrictions: PGUs shall not be used for IFR navigation, instrument
     approaches, or as a primary flight reference and will not be used as a substitute for any
     required flight equipment. PGUs must be tested IAW requirements of paragraph 2.9.6.
     2.16.4.1. (USAFE) Portable GPS Units (PGUs). USAFE approves PGU use IAW AFI
     11-2MDSV3 guidance; aircrew training and documentation shall be IAW MDS-specific
     standards.
     2.16.4.2. Mission enhancement systems. These systems are intended to enhance
     mission capability when conducting tactical operations such as weapons delivery and
     airdrop. Systems that do not comply with the minimum standards of Technical Standards
     Order (TSO) C-129/C-129a will not be used for instrument navigation without specific
     MAJCOM approval. MAJCOMS that approve the use of these systems for en route
     navigation must publish specific usage guidance and restrictions. Mission enhancement
     systems will not be used for terminal operations except when they are part of a navigation
     system capable of self-contained instrument approaches as outlined in paragraph 8.17.6.
     2.16.4.2. (USAFE) Mission enhancement systems. USAFE approves use of mission
     enhancement systems (e.g. Enhanced GPS/INS [EGI]) IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3.
     2.16.4.3. Systems Meeting Civil Requirements For IFR Use. The following guidance
     covers those systems that are properly certified and approved for operational use.
     Comply also with AFMAN 11-217 Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures, RNAV
     approach procedures.
         2.16.4.3.1. RAIM Prediction. Pilots shall always ensure RAIM availability prior to
         commencing an RNAV procedure (departure, arrival or approach) using any
         MAJCOM-approved RNAV equipment. If TSO-C129 equipment is used solely to
         satisfy the RNAV requirement, RAIM availability must be confirmed for the intended
         route of flight (route and time) using current GPS satellite information. Pilots may
26                AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


     choose to monitor the status of each satellite in its plane/slot position, account for the
     latest GPS constellation NOTAMs, and compute RAIM availability using model-
     specific RAIM prediction software, by using an en route and terminal RAIM
     prediction     websites      such     as:       http://www.raimprediction.net           or
     http://augur.ecacnav.com/augur/app/home, or by contacting a flight service
     station. Receiver RAIM prediction capability may also be used. In the event of a
     predicted, continuous loss of RAIM, pilots should delay or re-route where RAIM
     requirements can be met if GPS is their only means of meeting the required RNAV
     performance. Pilots must continually assess their navigation capability in case of
     GPS failure. In the NAS only, if TSO-C145/146 equipment is used to satisfy the
     RNAV requirement, RAIM prediction need not be accomplished if Wide-Area
     Augmentation Service (WAAS) coverage is confirmed available along the route of
     flight.
     2.16.4.3.1. (USAFE) RAIM Prediction. USAFE authorizes the use of the RNAV
     equipment specific to each MDS IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3 guidance.
     2.16.4.3.2. Flying RNAV Approaches. MAJCOMs must approve the use of Flight
     Mission Computers (FMC) or Flight Management Systems (FMS) guidance to fly
     approaches with or without ―GPS‖ or ―or GPS‖ in the title. Pilot using suitable
     RNAV equipment to fly an approach must extract the entire procedure from a current
     database, and may not alter the extracted procedure.
     2.16.4.3.2. (USAFE) Flying RNAV Approaches. USAFE approves FMC/FMS use
     for and during approaches with or without ―GPS‖ or ―or GPS‖ in the title IAW AFI
     11-2MDSV3 guidance.
     2.16.4.3.3. RNAV Substitution. On procedures developed by a US TERPS
     authority (FAA/USAF/USN), or on WGS-84 compliant procedures reviewed by
     MAJCOM TERPS, MAJCOM-approved suitable RNAV systems may be used as a
     substitute means of navigation for a named fix, VOR, TACAN, NDB, DME or
     compass locator. In such terminal areas, following a successful predictive RAIM
     check, approved RNAV systems may be substituted for required NAVAIDS or
     named fixes on arrivals, departures, and non-localizer based instrument procedures.
     Any such substitution must be extracted from a current database. These operations
     are allowable even when a facility is explicitly identified as required on a procedure
     (e.g., ―Note ADF required‖), but not if the procedure is NOTAM’ed as NA. Pilots
     using approved RNAV systems as a substitute means of navigation guidance in lieu
     of an out of service NAVAID should advise ATC of this intent and capability. Pilots
     will tune, identify, monitor and display the appropriate ground-based NAVAIDs
     whenever practicable.
     2.16.4.3.3. (USAFE) RNAV Substitution. USAFE authorizes RNAV substitution
     operations as stipulated in AFI 11-2MDSV3 guidance.
     2.16.4.3.4. Terminal Area Operations using RNAV Substitution. Using a
     MAJCOM-approved suitable RNAV system, pilots may determine aircraft position
     over or distance from a VOR, TACAN, NDB, compass locator, DME fix; or a named
     fix defined by a VOR radial, TACAN course, NDB bearing, or compass locator
     bearing intersecting a VOR or localizer course. Further, pilots may navigate to or
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                         27


       from a VOR, TACAN, NDB, or compass locator, or hold over a VOR, TACAN,
       NDB, compass locator, or DME fix, or fly an arc based upon DME.
       2.16.4.3.4. (USAFE) Terminal Area Operations using RNAV Substitution.
       USAFE authorizes Terminal Area Operations using RNAV substitution as stipulated
       in AFI 11-2MDSV3 guidance.
       2.16.4.3.5. RNAV Prohibitions. RNAV systems using DME/DME/IRU, without
       GPS or WAAS position input, may only be used as a substitute means of navigation
       when specifically authorized by a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) or other
       FAA/MAJCOM guidance for a specific procedure, NAVAID, or fix. The NOTAM or
       other FAA/MAJCOM guidance authorizing the use of DME/DME/IRU systems will
       also identify any required DME facilities based on an FAA assessment of the DME
       navigation infrastructure.   The following RNAV substitution operations are
       prohibited:
          2.16.4.3.5.1. Substitution of the navigational aid providing lateral guidance for
          the final approach segment of an instrument procedure without reference to the
          raw navigational data.
          2.16.4.3.5.2. Navigation on any localizer-based course without reference to raw
          localizer data.
          2.16.4.3.5.3. Navigation on procedures that are identified as not authorized
          (―NA‖) without exception by a NOTAM. For example, RNAV substitution
          allowances do not apply to a procedure affected by an expired or unsatisfactory
          flight inspection, or if a procedure is based upon a recently decommissioned
          NAVAID.
       2.16.4.3.6. RNAV Navigation Augmentation. Space-Based Augmentation (SBAS)
       or Wide-Area Augmentation (WAAS) provide greater fidelity to GPS navigation data
       solutions.    MAJCOMs will approve the use of SBAS/WAAS for en-route and
       terminal operations. These systems must be ―properly certified‖ IAW TSO-C145A or
       TSO-C146A and installed IAW AC 20-130A. MAJCOMs must publish MDS-
       specific guidance and ensure pilots are appropriately trained and/or certified prior to
       authorizing the use of any augmented RNAV navigation solutions.
       2.16.4.3.6. (USAFE) RNAV Navigation Augmentation. USAFE authorizes
       SBAS/WAAS operations as stipulated in AFI 11-2MDSV3 and lead-MAJCOM
       guidance.
          2.16.4.3.6.1. Pilots must check airfield NOTAMs for status and level of service
          available. When the IAP is annotated with the W symbol, site-specific WAAS
          UNRELIABLE NOTAMs or Air Traffic advisories are not provided for outages
          in WAAS Lateral Navigation (LNAV) or Vertical Navigation (VNAV) and
          Localizer-Performance with Vertical Guidance (LPV) service. In this case, pilots
          will use LNAV weather minima, or Baro VNAV, if so equipped, for flight
          planning decisions at these locations.
          2.16.4.3.6.1. (USAFE) Prior to using any augmented RNAV navigation
          solutions, aircrew will be trained and certified IAW AFI 11-2MDSV1 and local

             guidance. Units will document the training IAW MDS and local guidance.
             2.16.4.3.6.2. When using augmented avionics as the planned approach at a
             required (and otherwise qualified) alternate, pilots will base flight planning
             decisions on the RNAV (GPS) LNAV minima line. Upon arrival at an alternate,
             if SBAS/WAAS is available, then pilots may use vertical guidance to complete
             the approach using the displayed level of service.
  2.16.5. Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications (MNPS) Airspace. Pilots will
  not fly in MNPS airspace until their aircraft is properly certified and approved by the lead
  command.
     2.16.5.1. Aircraft meeting the North Atlantic Track (NAT) MNPS requirements meet the
     Canadian Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications (CMNPS) requirements.
     2.16.5.2. Pilots operating aircraft in NAT airspace designated as MNPS must comply
     with requirements specified in applicable FLIP area planning documents.
     2.16.5.3. Pilots operating aircraft in CMNPS airspace must comply with the
     requirements specified in FLIP AP/1, Chapter 3.
     2.16.5.4. HQ USAF/A3O, through HQ AFFSA, must approve waivers to the
     requirements of NAT MNPS and/or CMNPS airspace.
  2.16.6. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RVSM) Airspace. Pilots will not fly in
  RVSM airspace unless their aircraft is properly certified by the lead command or unless ATC
  provides a clearance allowing entrance of a non-RVSM aircraft into RVSM airspace. Prior
  to operational approval, MAJCOMs will ensure pilots operating aircraft IAW RVSM criteria
  comply with requirements specified in FLIP GP and applicable AP guidance.
  2.16.6. (USAFE) Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RVSM) Airspace. In
  addition to AFI 11-2MDS training and evaluation guidance, units will periodically evaluate
  aircrew compliance with specific RVSM requirements in FLIP GP and HN-specific AP
  guidance.
     2.16.6.1. Prior to entry into RVSM airspace, the following shall be operating normally:
         2.16.6.1.1. Two primary altitude measurement systems,
         2.16.6.1.2. One automatic altitude control system (autopilot),
         2.16.6.1.3. One altitude alerting device, and
         2.16.6.1.4. An operational transponder.
     2.16.6.2. The PIC will notify the controlling agency as soon as possible should any of the
     equipment above fail after entering RVSM airspace.
  2.16.7. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. Pilots will not operate in
  RNP airspace unless aircraft systems/equipment are certified IAW applicable civil standards
  and lead commands provide operational approval.
     2.16.7.1. MAJCOMs will ensure that crews are aware of any special conditions or
     limitations associated with operations in each level of RNP airspace.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                           29


       2.16.7.1. (USAFE) In addition to AFI 11-2MDS training and evaluation guidance, units
       will periodically evaluate aircrew knowledge of the special conditions/limitations
       associated with operations in each level of RNP airspace that the unit’s aircraft are
       capable of operating.
       2.16.7.2. The applicable RNP level and any equipment conditions or limitations depicted
       on affected FLIP charts and procedures will be followed.
       2.16.7.3. Pilots will advise ATC if an equipment failure or other malfunction results in
       the loss of aircraft capability to continue operating in the designated RNP airspace.
       2.16.7.4. When a specified RNP level cannot be achieved, the pilot should revise the
       route or delay the operation until appropriate RNP level can be ensured.
   2.16.8. Operations within RNP-10 or Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) Airspace. Pilots
   must ensure their aircraft systems are MAJCOM approved to fly in RNP 10 or RNAV 5/B-
   RNAV airspace. MAJCOM approval to fly in RNP-10 or BRNAV airspace is restricted to
   aircraft systems that are ―properly certified.‖
   2.16.8. (USAFE) Operations within RNP-10 or Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV)
   Airspace. USAFE approves equipment usage and operations within RNP-10 or BRNAV
   airspace IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, and TO guidance.
2.17. Electronic Flight Bags (EFB). Any device, installed or portable, used as an EFB must
provide an equivalent level of safety and performance to that provided by paper products. For
the purpose of this instruction, EFB products include, but are not limited to, laptop computers,
tablet PCs, electronic kneeboards, and tethered displays. See also paragraph 2.3. EFB systems
must comply with the testing requirements of paragraph 2.9.
   2.17.1. EFB Certification and Authorization. Prior to authorizing EFB operations, the
   User MAJCOM will (in coordination with Lead MAJCOM):
       2.17.1.1. Ensure EFBs comply with current guidance in FAA Advisory Circular AC 120-
       76. MAJCOMs should also reference the information stored on the HQ AFFSA
       CNS/ATM CoP: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/a3on.
       2.17.1.2. Ensure EFB flight manual data (including checklists) is displayed IAW AFI 11-
       215.
       2.17.1.3. Ensure EFB terminal procedure data is displayed identically in format and size
       to the published paper version. The EFB must not require scroll or zoom to view the
       Instrument Approach Procedure (IAP). Alternate formats/sizes of IAPs require
       evaluation of software functionality and human factors by the aircraft program office and
       endorsement by the user/lead command. Forward endorsement through HQ AFFSA for
       HQ USAF/A3O approval.
       2.17.1.4. Ensure EFBs with moving map software or display of own ship position are not
       used as a primary means of navigation (applies to both airborne and ground
       operations). This functionality will only be used as a tool to enhance situational
       awareness.
       2.17.1.5. Establish an aircrew training program to certify crews in use of EFBs, to
       include procedures for EFB failure in flight.

     2.17.1.6. Publish written approval prior to aircrew use of EFBs.
     2.17.1.7. Ensure paper publications are carried as a back-up unless paperless cockpit
     transition is complete.
     2.17.1.8. (Added-USAFE) USAFE authorizes EFB usage IAW lead MAJCOM
     authorization as published in AFI 11-2MDSV3 guidance.
  2.17.2. Paperless Cockpit Transition. Lead and User MAJCOMs transitioning an MDS to
  a paperless cockpit will develop a process which follows the recommended risk mitigation
  practices found in AC 120-76. A 6-month evaluation must be accomplished during which
  back-up paper products must be readily available onboard the aircraft. Following the
  evaluation period, a final reliability report must be submitted to the lead command for
  coordination through HQ AFFSA to HQ USAF/A3O for approval of paperless operations.
  2.17.2. (USAFE) Paperless Cockpit Transition. USAFE aircrew are authorized
  paperless-cockpit operations IAW lead MAJCOM authorization as published in AFI 11-
  2MDSV3 guidance.

                                           Chapter 3

                    FLIGHT PLANS AND PASSENGER MANIFESTS

3.1. Flight Plan Requirements. A flight plan enables search and rescue (SAR) agencies to
search for an overdue aircraft. An IFR flight plan communicates the pilot’s desires to ATC.
Approved flight plans include those listed in FLIP GP, an FAA or ICAO Flight Plan form, or a
host nation or MAJCOM-approved form (including computer forms). The PIC will ensure a
flight plan is filed for any flight of a USAF aircraft.
3.1. (USAFE) Flight Plan Requirements. IAW AFI 11-401_USAFESUP_I, aircrew may use
the AF Form 4327, ARMS Flight Authorization, instead of DD Form 1801, DoD International
Flight Plan for local area flights. Additionally, aircrew may use forms as prescribed in AFI 11-
2MDSV3, local, and HN guidance.
   3.1.1. Mission Command and Control (C2). When at a non-military installation and a
   Flight Service Station (FSS) or Air Traffic Control (ATC) are not reachable, the pilot will
   ensure flight following by providing the mission C2 agency the intended route prior to
   takeoff. Once airborne, the PIC will stay clear of Area Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ),
   Buffer Zones, and other restricted airspace, fly VFR in controlled airspace (or IFR IAW
   paragraph 4.6), and file a flight plan with a FSS or ATC facility as soon as practicable.
   3.1.2. Procedures for Units Without a Base Operations. When a written flight plan form
   is not processed through base operations, the flying unit must have a written agreement with
   airfield management outlining the procedures for handling flight movement, messages and
   identifying the agency responsible for flight following.
   3.1.3. Flight Plan Changes. The format for making changes to a flight plan is printed on
   the inside cover of the DoD Flight Supplement. Before takeoff, or while airborne, the PIC
   may make changes to the original filed flight plan without re-filing provided:
       3.1.3.1. The change does not penetrate an ADIZ.
       3.1.3.2. The controlling ATC agency approves the change for an IFR flight.
       3.1.3.3. The PIC ensures the facility providing flight following is notified of the change.
       Failure to ensure a FSS (or its overseas equivalent) is aware of the change may result in
       erroneous SAR efforts or an unannounced arrival at the destination.
       3.1.3.4. The change complies with applicable host-nation rules.
   3.1.4. Destination Notification. If unable to contact the command and control agency, the
   PIC will contact the FSS or equivalent as soon as practicable. The PIC will request the
   destination be advised of the departure time for flight following and to prevent an
   unannounced arrival.
   3.1.5. Closing the Flight Plan. If operating in the NAS on an IFR flight plan into an airport
   with a functioning control tower, the flight plan is automatically closed upon landing. In all
   other cases, the PIC will ensure an activated flight plan is closed through a FSS or ATC
   facility by any means of communication available. If necessary, call long distance collect.
 32                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


   3.1.6. (Added-USAFE) IAW FLIP GP, aircraft that are not 8.33KHz capable but are
   equipped with UHF radios will insert the letter ―M‖ in field 8, the letter ―U‖ in field 10, and
   the indicator ―STS/EXM833‖ in field 18 of the filed flight plan.
3.2. Passenger Manifests and Crew Lists. List passengers on a DD Form 2131, Passenger
Manifest, or a MAJCOM-approved form. File the manifest and crew list with the flight plan, the
passenger service facility, or other responsible agency. Notify C2 prior to departure if there is a
passenger manifest (or crew list) change. When able, process crew and manifest changes with
the original processing facility or with a responsible agency.
3.2. (USAFE) Passenger Manifests and Crew Lists. Aircrew may use forms as prescribed in
AFI 11-2MDSV3 and local guidance and computer generated passenger manifests provided by
the passenger terminal function at DoD installations.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                              33

   Special Use Airspace or Military Training Routes in FLIP.
   4.4.9. The Formation Lead ensured each member of the formation flight was briefed on all
   pertinent aspects of the planned flight, and the PIC of each aircraft in the formation possesses
   an instrument rating (Army and Navy Special and Instrument Ratings, and FAA
   Instrument/Airline Transport Pilot Ratings meet this requirement) if any portion of the flight
   is to be conducted in IMC or under IFR (see paragraph 4.2. above).
 34                    AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


   4.4.9. (USAFE) The only authorized ―instrument rating‖ is achieved by successful
   completion of an AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2MDSV2 instrument (INSTM) evaluation.
      4.4.9.1. (Added-USAFE) See paragraph 4.2 (USAFE) for upgrading/requalifying
      pilots who do not have an instrument qualification.
   4.4.10. (Added-USAFE) The PIC will sign the aircraft commander’s signature block on the
   AF Form 4327 and/or DD Form 1801 (as applicable). If the pilot does not possess approval
   authority, the SQ/CC, or designated representative, will sign. A pen and ink signature is not
   required for electronically generated/transmitted flight plans. During exercises or
   contingencies, the SQ/CC or designated representative may be the approval authority for
   pilots under the commander’s control.
4.5. Additional Approval and Requirements.
   4.5.1. Use of Military and Joint Use Airports. Pilots may file to and land at US military
   and Joint-Use (e.g. MIL/CIV) fields unless restricted by the MAJCOM.
   4.5.2. Use of Civil Airports. MAJCOMs may authorize filing to or landing at civil airports.
   Use of civil airports not governed by agreement or law may result in landing fees or use fees
   charged to the pilot or the military unit.
   4.5.2. (USAFE) Use of Civil Airports. USAFE authorizes the filing to or landing at civil
   airports IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3 and local guidance. When filing to/landing at foreign civil
   fields, aircrew will ensure familiarity with applicable HN guidance and procedures. See also
   Attachment 5 (Added) Control of Fighter Aircraft For Off-Station Sorties/Diverts.
   4.5.3. Use of Civil P Airports. Unless restricted by the MAJCOM, pilots may file to or

                                GENERAL FLIGHT RULES

5.1. Professional Flying Standards.
   5.1.1. Reckless Flying. The PIC is responsible for ensuring the aircraft is not operated in a
   careless, reckless or irresponsible manner that could endanger life or property.
   5.1.2. Off-Station Training. Commanders will ensure that all off-station training flights
   meet valid training requirements and present a positive image of the Air Force. The PIC
   shall execute off-station training activities to achieve valid training requirements, present a
   positive view of the Air Force and shall ensure no appearance of government waste or abuse
   occurs.
   5.1.2. (USAFE) Off-Station Training. Except for emergencies and specific USAFE-
   directed missions, HN airfields planned for use by a USAFE aircraft must meet the
   requirements outlined in this document. See also Attachment 5 (Added).
      5.1.2.1. Aviation Into-Plane Reimbursement Card (AIR CARD) Responsibilities.
      The PIC shall use the AIR CARD only for fuel and required ground services. Refuel at
      military installations as a first choice, followed by contract fixed base operators (FBOs).
      Refuel at non-contract FBOs only if mission needs warrant servicing at such locations.
      Further information, including documentation procedures and updated lists of contract
      FBOs, is available at: https://www.airseacard.com.
   5.1.3. Unauthorized Flight Demonstrations.              Unauthorized or impromptu flight
   demonstrations, maneuvers, events or ―fly-bys‖ are prohibited. AFI 11-209, Air Force
   Participation in Aerial Events, addresses authorized flight demonstrations.
   5.1.3. (USAFE) Unauthorized Flight Demonstrations. ―Unauthorized or impromptu
   flight demonstrations, maneuvers, events or ―fly-bys‖ are defined as maneuvers/events
   conducted with the express purposes of demonstrating the capabilities of USAFE aircraft, but
   without proper approval IAW AFI 11-209.
   5.1.4. Readiness for Duty. A person shall not act as a crewmember of an aircraft:
      5.1.4.1. While under the influence of alcohol or its after-effects. Aircrew members shall
      not consume alcoholic beverages within 12 hours of take-off.
      5.1.4.2. While using, or while under the influence of, any substance that affects the
      crewmember’s ability to safely perform assigned duties.
      5.1.4.3. Anytime physical or psychological condition is suspect or known to be
      detrimental to the safe performance of flight duty. Consult a flight surgeon at the earliest
      opportunity.
      5.1.4.4. While self-medicating except IAW AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and
      Standards.       Air Force Surgeon General guidance is available at:
      https://kx.afms.mil/kxweb/dotmil/kjPage.do?cid=CTB_020686&functionalArea=Ae
      rospaceMedicine.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                               37


       5.1.4.5. Anytime the crewmember has not obtained the appropriate crew rest IAW
       Chapter 9.
5.2. Transporting Passengers Under the Influence. The PIC will ensure personnel suspected
to be under the influence of intoxicants or narcotics are not allowed to board a USAF aircraft
except in an emergency or when authorized by competent authority.
5.3. Crew at Stations. Crewmembers must occupy their assigned duty stations from takeoff to
landing, unless absence is normal in the performance of crew duties, or in connection with
physiological needs. Pilots shall not leave their duty station unless another qualified pilot
establishes control of the aircraft.
   5.3.1. While operating outside restricted or warning areas each RPA shall have dedicated
   pilots controlling/monitoring its flight.
5.4. See and Avoid. Pilots operating in VMC, under IFR or VFR, whether or not under radar
control, are always responsible to see and avoid other traffic, terrain, and obstacles.
   5.4.1. Standard IFR separation is provided between aircraft operating under IFR in
   controlled airspace. Within the NAS, ATC provides traffic advisories on VFR aircraft on a
   time-permitting basis. Outside the NAS, the crew should consult ICAO and country specific
   guidance outlined in the FCG and FLIP.
   5.4.2. For UAS operations to comply with see and avoid requirements, the RPA must have
   the capability to detect/sense other traffic in sufficient time to perform an avoidance
   maneuver.
       5.4.2.1. UAS operations that do not comply with paragraph 5.4. will be conducted under
       specific arrangements with appropriate aviation authorities (FAA, host nation, or military
       control). FAA COAs issued IAW JO 7610.4 (Chapter 12, Section 9) or arrangements
       with host-nation aviation authorities do not always waive the CFRs nor provide relief
       from ICAO Rules of the Air. JO 7610.4 outlines an equivalent level of safety
       comparable to see and avoid requirements for manned aircraft. UAS operations in
       compliance with an FAA COA, host-nation aviation authorization or in special use
       airspace are acceptable provided the appropriate equivalent level of safety measures are
       in place with controlling agencies and other airspace users.
5.5. Proximity of Aircraft. The PIC must not allow the aircraft to be flown so close to another
that it creates a collision hazard. Use 500 ft. of separation (well clear) as an approximate guide
except for:
   5.5.1. Authorized formation flights.
   5.5.2. Emergency situations requiring assistance from another aircraft. If an emergency
   requires visual checks of an aircraft in distress, the PIC must exercise extreme care to ensure
   this action does not increase the overall hazard. The capabilities of the distressed aircraft and
   the intentions of the crews involved must be considered before operating near another aircraft
   in flight.
   5.5.3. MAJCOM-approved maneuvers in which participants are aware of the nature of the
   maneuver and qualified to conduct it safely (i.e., interceptor attack training).
 38                      AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


   5.5.3. (USAFE) In addition to AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, and TO guidance as well as MDS-
   specific AFTTPs, USAFE authorizes maneuvers IAW Allied Command Europe (ACE)
   Manual 75-2-1, Fighting Edge Air-to-Air Training Rules. Additionally, with concurrence of
   the PIC, aircrew may accept requests from European controllers for HN aircraft to conduct
   training intercepts.
5.6. Formation Flight.
   5.6.1. Transponder Operations During Air Refueling or Formation Flight. Unless
   otherwise specified in Allied Communications Publication 160, US Supplement 1:
      5.6.1.1. Only one aircraft (normally the lead) of a standard formation will squawk the
      assigned code.
      5.6.1.2. Unless otherwise directed by ATC, all aircraft within a non-standard formation
      flight will squawk the ATC-assigned Mode 3A/C beacon code until established within
      the assigned altitude block and closed to the proper en route interval. When aircraft
      interval exceeds 3 NMs, both the formation leader and the last aircraft will squawk the
      assigned Mode 3A/C beacon code.
      5.6.1.3. Unless otherwise directed, receivers squawk standby when <3NMs from the
      tanker.
      5.6.1.4. (Added-USAFE) USAFE aircrew will squawk IAW HN rules and agreements
      or as-directed by HN controllers. In the absence of HN guidance, follow paragraphs
      above.
   5.6.2. Non-standard Formation Flight. Non-standard formation flights may be conducted:
      5.6.2.1. When approved by ATC, or
      5.6.2.1. (USAFE) In the UK, ATC approval for non-standard formation is implied when
      flying under Traffic or Deconfliction Service (reference UK MIL AIP).
      5.6.2.2. Operating under VFR in VMC, or
      5.6.2.3. Operating within an authorized Altitude Reservation (ALTRV), or
      5.6.2.4. Operating under the provisions of a Letter of Agreement (LOA), or
      5.6.2.5. Operating in airspace specifically designed for a special activity.
   5.6.3. (Added-USAFE) Dissimilar Formation Flights
      5.6.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Aerial Events (as defined in AFI 11-209, Aerial Event
      Policy and Procedures). Reference AFI 11-209 for definitions and guidance on
      ―Dissimilar Formation Flyovers‖ conducted in support of military or public events (e.g.
      Air/Trade Shows, etc.) held for community relations or ceremonial purposes. See also
      paragraph 5.22
      5.6.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Multinational          Training    Deployment          Flyovers. A
      ―dissimilar formation‖ is defined as a formation made up of aircraft either from different
      MDSs, different nations, or both. Dissimilar formations recovering from multinational
      training missions and planning to fly over HN staging bases are considered part of the
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                              39


       overall training mission and do not fall under AFI 11-209 requirements. This applies
       regardless of media or DV observance of the formation.
          5.6.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Units will notify USAFE/A3 of their intent to conduct a
          dissimilar formation flyover as part of any multinational training deployments.
          5.6.3.2.2. (Added-USAFE) To the max extent practical, notification will be via
          email to HQ USAFE/A3T (info to the ―USAFE/A3TO (Workflow)‖ org account)
          NLT two weeks prior to the event. By exception, short notice notification via phone
          call to HQ USAFE/A3T (DSN 314-480-6971) will be accepted.
       5.6.3.3. (Added-USAFE) Dissimilar Aircraft Training. For all other dissimilar
       formations and training, USAFE authorizes operations IAW AFI 11-214, 11-2MDSV3,
       and MDS-specific AFTTP guidance. USAF flight leads will ensure all formation
       members know and understand applicable HN rules and agreements, and any applicable
       SPINS and TRs (e.g. ACE 75-2-1, Fighting Edge Air-to-Air Training Rules).
5.7. Right-of-Way. Each pilot must take whatever action is necessary to avoid collision,
regardless of who has the right-of-way. The yielding aircraft must not pass over, under, abeam,
or ahead of the other aircraft until well clear.
   5.7.1. Distress. Aircraft in distress have the right-of-way over all other air traffic.
   5.7.2. Converging. When converging at approximately the same altitude (except head-on or
   approximately so), the aircraft to the other's right has the right-of-way. Aircraft of different
   categories have the right-of-way in the following order of priority: balloons, gliders, aircraft
   towing or refueling other aircraft, airships, rotary- or fixed-wing aircraft.
   5.7.3. Approaching Head-On. If aircraft are approaching each other head-on or
   approximately so, each shall alter course to the right.
   5.7.4. Overtaking Aircraft. An overtaken aircraft has the right-of-way. The overtaking
   aircraft must alter course to the right.
   5.7.5. Landing. An aircraft established on final approach has the right-of-way over other
   aircraft on the ground or in the air, except when two or more aircraft are approaching to land.
   In this case, the aircraft at the lower altitude has the right-of-way but it shall not use this
   advantage to cut in front of or overtake the other.
5.8. Communication in Flight.
   5.8.1. Air Traffic Control Clearances. The PIC will comply with ATC clearances and
   instructions unless a deviation is necessary due to an in-flight emergency, to ensure safety of
   flight or to comply with a Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) resolution
   advisory (RA). Pilots will use standard aviation terminology, in English, from the Pilot-
   Controller glossary, MAJCOM guidance and FLIP when communicating with ATC.
   5.8.1. (USAFE) Air Traffic Control Clearances. To the max extent practical, aircrew will
   use HN English terminology when speaking to HN controllers. In any circumstances where
   interpretation is in question, aircrew will use plain language to convey their
   requests/intentions.
       5.8.1.1. Maintain two-way radio communications with the proper ATC facility or FSS
       IAW the procedures appropriate for the class of airspace as outlined in FLIP.
40                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


     5.8.1.2. If the pilot is unsure of any clearance, immediately obtain ATC clarification.
  5.8.2. Transponder Operations. The PIC will ensure an operable transponder is used IAW
  ATC instructions or host nation or MAJCOM directives, SPINS, or for any flight in
  controlled airspace (including MODE 4 when directed). In the NAS, transponders should be
  operated any time the aircraft is moving. For aircraft that are equipped with Mode S, the PIC
  must follow proper usage guidelines as outlined in GP. MAJCOMs will manage assigned
  codes to ensure no two aircraft are airborne with the same Mode-S address/code. Mode 4
  operations are restricted to those necessary, and as outlined in the Flight Information
  Handbook (See MODE 4 in glossary).
     5.8.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Mode 3A/C. Aircrew will reference AFI 11-2MDSV3 for
     further guidance on IFF equipment requirements and required self-tests prior to takeoff.
     5.8.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Mode 4. Local guidance will clarify Mode 4 usage with
     respect to HN restrictions (reference applicable MIL AIPs and HN guidance on when to
     squawk Mode 4 within the boundaries of a specific country). This applies to deployed as
     well as home station operations.
     5.8.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Mode S. Reference Attachment 9 (Added).
         5.8.2.3.1. (Added-USAFE) MAF. Mode S will be on for all flights.
         5.8.2.3.2. (Added-USAFE) CAF. Dynamic addresses will be used and Mode S will
         be on anytime Mode 3/A/C is selected or when requested by the controller. If there is
         any confusion, query the controller using plain language.
  5.8.3. Emergency Frequencies. If suitably equipped, aircrews will monitor at least one
  emergency frequency at all times as mission and operational conditions permit. Immediately
  report distress or ELT transmissions to ATC.
  5.8.4. Radio Frequency Restrictions. Unless specifically authorized by competent
  authority, USAF aircraft will not transmit on frequencies reserved for air navigation (115.95
  – 117.95 MHz, 328.6 – 335.4 MHz). Limit radio traffic on 118.0 – 137.0 MHz frequencies
  to ATC communications. Do not transmit secure voice/data communications on other than
  approved frequencies.
  5.8.5. ATC Communications Failure. Follow the communications failure procedures
  published in the FIH.
  5.8.6. UAS ATC Communications Requirements. For RPA operations in controlled
  airspace two-way radio communications will be the primary means of communications.
  When Ultra High Frequency (UHF)/Very High Frequency (VHF) radios are not available, a
  telephone may be used as a primary means of communication. The PIC shall ensure a
  MAJCOM-approved back-up means of communication is available while the RPA is
  airborne in controlled airspace. For limited range, short duration flights, the PIC may request
  relief from radio requirements from affected ATC agencies provided a suitable alternate
  communication means is available. All UAS units will maintain a current list of landline
  contact information for all ARTCCs, Radar Approach Controls, and Airfield Towers through
  which the RPA may transit on its flight-planned route as well as its planned lost-
  link/emergency route. UAS pilots will include the number of the Ground Control Segment
  (GCS) landline (solely dedicated for ATC use) in the remarks section of the flight plan.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                           41


5.9. Aircraft Speed.
   5.9.1. Supersonic Flight. The PIC will not allow the aircraft to operate at or above Mach l
   except as specified in AFI 13-201. Inadvertent flight above Mach 1 will be handled IAW
   AFI 13-201.
   5.9.1. (USAFE) Supersonic Flight. Outside the NAS, USAFE aircrew will conduct
   supersonic flight IAW HN rules and agreements. Aircrew will report inadvertent flight above
   Mach 1 when not in HN-approved airspace IAW AFI 13-201, local, and HN rules and
   agreements.
   5.9.2. In the NAS. The PIC will:
       5.9.2.1. Not allow their aircraft to exceed 250 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) below
       10,000 ft. MSL unless the MAJCOM has approved a higher speed IAW paragraph 5.9.5.
       5.9.2.2. Not allow their aircraft to exceed 200 KIAS at or below 2,500 ft. AGL within 4
       NMs of the primary airport of a Class C or Class D airspace area unless authorized by
       ATC, or required to maintain the minimum safe maneuvering airspeed specified in the
       aircraft T.O.
       5.9.2.3. Not allow their aircraft to exceed 200 KIAS in the airspace underlying a Class B
       airspace area or in a VFR corridor designated through Class B airspace area, unless
       required to maintain the minimum safe maneuvering airspeed specified in the aircraft
       T.O.
   5.9.3. Outside the NAS. The PIC will not allow the aircraft to exceed 250 KIAS below
   10,000 ft. MSL unless: in international airspace and mission requirements dictate; ICAO or
   host nation rules permit or it is necessary to maintain the minimum safe airspeed in the
   aircraft T.O.
   5.9.4. Holding. Conduct holding at airspeeds prescribed in FLIP or MDS-specific guidance.
   5.9.5. FAA Speed Authorization. The FAA recognizes that certain military operations and
   training requirements cannot be met under the terms of the 14 CFR §91.117, Aircraft Speed,
   and has therefore granted a speed authorization to the USAF.
       5.9.5.1. Use of FAA Speed Authorization. In the NAS, PICs may operate USAF
       aircraft in excess of 250 KIAS, below 10,000 ft. MSL, only under the following
       conditions:
          5.9.5.1.1. Within restricted areas or Military Operating Areas (MOAs).
          5.9.5.1.2. Within DoD/FAA mutually developed instrument routes or DoD
          developed visual routes. (Do not exceed 250 KIAS on SR routes).
          5.9.5.1.3. Within unpublished joint MAJCOM- and FAA-designated areas or routes.
          This provision is intended to accommodate speed requirements, as necessary to
          accomplish the national defense mission, on an interim basis until the area/route can
          be published
          5.9.5.1.4. On MAJCOM-approved large exercises or short-term special missions
          with appropriate coordination to ensure awareness of the nonparticipating flying
          public.
 42                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


           5.9.5.1.5. When the aircraft T.O. requires or recommends a higher speed in order to
           maintain safe maneuverability. If the safe maneuvering airspeed in the T.O. is listed
           as a range, fly the slowest speed practical in that range, based on weight and
           configuration. This provision is primarily to accommodate climbs/descents and
           terminal area operations. Airspeeds applicable to this exemption must be published
           in the aircraft T.O. (Dash-1). A MAJCOM supplement or MDS-specific Volume 3
           does not constitute the aircraft flight manual as referenced in the FAA exemption.
5.10. Large Scale Exercises. MAJCOMs will conduct large-scale exercises in permanent or
temporary special-use airspace established according to FAA Handbook 7400.2 and FAA JO
7610.4. When MAJCOMs approve large-scale exercises or short-term special missions they will
ensure information on approved activities is available to the non-participating flying public and
coordinate these operations with:
5.10. (USAFE)Large Scale Exercises. FAA Handbook 7400.2 and FAA JO 7610.4. do not
apply within the USAFE AOR. Large-scale exercises involving only US forces within the
USAFE AOR will be coordinated with HN military liaisons IAW HN rules and agreements.
Large-scale exercises involving US forces and forces from other countries will be coordinated
IAW NATO standards and procedures (i.e. through the applicable NATO CAOC).
   5.10.1. Affected non-participating military flying units.
   5.10.2. Affected FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCCs).
   5.10.3. Affected FAA regions through the Air Force representative (AFREP).
   5.10.4. Other agencies, as appropriate.
5.11. Airport Operations.
   5.11.1. Ground Operations. Pilots shall comply with AFI 11-218, Aircraft Movement on
   the Ground, and locally-published procedures as applicable.
       5.11.1.1. UAS-specific Ground Operations.               In the absence of MDS-specific
       MAJCOM guidance, PICs must not taxi a RPA prior to takeoff, or after landing, from a
       control station that does not have a line-of-sight link with the RPA.
       5.11.1.2. In the absence of MAJCOM guidance, RPA will not taxi on a controlled
       surface without an escort present who is in continuous communication with the pilot.
       Exception: If the RPA lands at a divert location where no local procedures exist and ATC
       has an unobstructed view of the RPA, the controller may clear the RPA to taxi if deemed
       necessary to vacate its position.
       5.11.1.3. PICs will ensure the aircraft propulsion and all power sources are shut down as
       soon as practical after landing and clearing the controlled surface areas if at a location
       with no GCS and/or unit ground personnel.
       5.11.1.4. If no unit personnel are present to safeguard the RPA, the pilot will coordinate
       appropriate aircraft security until retrieval of the aircraft by military personnel.
       5.11.1.5. MAJCOMs must establish or approve hung ordnance, hot brakes, and other
       safety procedures to ensure the safety of ground personnel, to include diverts.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                          43


     5.11.1.5. (USAFE) The OG/CC is responsible for establishing hung ordnance, hot
     brakes, and all other MDS-specific safety procedures (e.g. hydrazine) to include
     considerations for these items at planned divert fields.
  5.11.2. Clearances. Obtain clearance from ATC before taxiing, taking a runway, or any
  takeoff or landing at an airport with an operating control tower.
  5.11.3. Taxi Clearance. If a taxi route requires crossing any runway, pilots will hold short
  until obtaining specific clearance to cross each runway. Do not taxi across or onto the
  assigned runway without clearance from ATC.
  5.11.3. (USAFE) Taxi Clearance. Paragraph 5.11.3 also applies at all ICAO airfields
  within the USAFE AOR (to include the following US-controlled fields that follow ICAO
  procedures: Lajes AB, Moron AB, Aviano AB, and Incirlik AB). If unsure of the exact taxi
  clearance or if approaching a runway without specific clearance to hold short or cross,
  aircrew will query the controller.
     5.11.3.1. Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (SMGCS). Pilots of USAF
     aircraft must obtain MAJCOM-directed training and certification before participating in
     actual SMGCS taxi operations. MAJCOMs shall publish MDS-specific guidance for
     aircrews required to operate at SMGCS locations in low visibility.
     5.11.3.1. (USAFE) Surface Movement Guidance and Control System (SMGCS).
     USAFE SMGCS training/certification, documentation, and operations will be IAW AFI
     11-218, AFI 11-2MDSV3 and local guidance, and MDS-specific AFTTPs.
  5.11.4. Uncontrolled Field Procedures. Use the runway favored by the winds if no other
  factors make that runway unacceptable. Announce your activities on the appropriate
  frequency. (Refer to the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) and AFMAN 11-217,
  Volume 2, Visual Flight Procedures, for specific procedures.) In the absence of MAJCOM-
  specific guidance, UAS operations are prohibited at uncontrolled fields when other traffic is
  present.
  5.11.5. Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO). USAF fixed-wing pilots are
  prohibited from accepting LAHSO clearances.
     5.11.5.1. Pilots of USAF aircraft may passively participate in LAHSO (land or take-off
     when another aircraft has been given a LAHSO clearance). The PIC is the final authority
     whether to take-off, land or continue a touch-and-go when a merging aircraft has received
     a LAHSO clearance.
     5.11.5.2. MAJCOMs of units that require active LAHSO participation for mission
     accomplishment must contact HQ AFFSA/A3OF to ensure MDS-specific data is
     incorporated into FAA Order 7110.199 (Appendix 3).
     5.11.5.2. (USAFE) LAHSO operations within the CONUS will be conducted IAW AFI
     11-2MDSV3 and local guidance. LAHSO operations within the USAFE AOR are not
     authorized.
  5.11.6. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). MAJCOMs may approve non-
  formation RSRS operations. Procedures are specified by affected ATC and user units.
  MAJCOM approval shall include MDS-specific RSRS criteria governing similar and
  dissimilar landing/touch-and-go/low approach operations.
 44                    AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


   5.11.6. (USAFE) Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). RSRS operations shall be
   executed IAW AFI 13-203_USAFESUP, Chapter 8. Once published, AFI 13-
   204V3_USAFESUP will supersede AFI 13-203_USAFESUP and become the source for
   RSRS guidance.
      5.11.6.1. (Added-USAFE) To facilitate safe RSRS operations, aircrew will pass runway
      braking action to the appropriate agency in the event that braking action is other than
      expected/reported.
   5.11.7. Turns after Takeoff, Low Approaches, or Closed Patterns. Do not turn after a
   takeoff, touch and go or low approach until at least 400 ft. above the Departure End of the
   Runway (DER) elevation, at a safe airspeed and past the end of the runway (if visible)
   unless: specifically cleared by the controlling agency or required by a published procedure.
   This restriction does not apply when executing a closed pattern.
   5.11.8. Traffic Pattern Procedures.
      5.11.8.1. At USAF installations fly the traffic pattern published in the local flying
      procedures publication or FLIP, unless otherwise directed.
      5.11.8.2. At other than USAF installations, fly traffic patterns as directed by the control
      tower or published in FLIP, CFR Part 91 Subpart B, or the AIM.
      5.11.8.3. At airports with no control tower, follow the standard light signals or visual
      indicators that prescribe the direction of traffic and landing runway. Departures must
      comply with the appropriate route for the airport. (Refer to AIM for more information.)
      5.11.8.4. Helicopters should avoid the flow of fixed-wing aircraft. Helicopters that
      maintain compatible airspeed may fly in the rectangular pattern with fixed-wing traffic.
   5.11.9. Helicopter Landing Areas. Helicopters may operate from/to other than established
   landing areas (i.e., fields, highways, parks, etc.) if conducting an operational mission or a
   military requirement exists and: the pilot receives permission to use the area for landing,
   safeguards exist to permit operations without hazard to persons or property and no legal
   objections are apparent.
5.12. Night Operations. See also paragraph 2.15.3. At night, the PIC will adhere to the
following guidance:
   5.12.1. Fixed wing aircraft must not operate from a runway unless it is outlined with
   operable lighting and is clearly discernible. Covert Infrared runway lighting being used by
   qualified crews equipped with Night Vision Devices (NVDs) meets this requirement.
   Exception: MAJCOM/A3 may authorize their aircraft to operate from unlit runways or
   landing zones (or those using high-intensity runway reflective markers) with the following
   restrictions:
      5.12.1.1. Non-contingency operations are restricted to military airfields or civilian
      airports with an appropriate LOA; and,
      5.12.1.2. MAJCOM must issue MDS-specific operating instructions, including
      comprehensive risk mitigation measures (such as IR lighting requirements, NVD usage,
      non-participating aircraft procedures, NOTAM issuance, weather and lunar illumination
      requirements and Operational Risk Management (ORM) assessments); and,
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                           45


       5.12.1.2. (USAFE) USAFE units are authorized to conduct operations at unlit
       runways/LZs IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3 guidance and MDS-specific AFTTPs. If no
       guidance exists, USAFE authorizes OG/CCs to approve operations as needed. Units will
       ensure comprehensive risk mitigation measures (see paragraph 5.12.1.2) are published
       and understood by all participating aircrew.
       5.12.1.3. Aircraft authorized to operate to unlit landing areas must comply with external
       lighting requirements in paragraph 5.20.
   5.12.2. In Alaska, areas located north of 60° North latitude, Antarctica, and areas located
   south of 60° South latitude, aircraft may be operated to unlighted airports during the period
   of civil twilight.
   5.12.3. Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations. Aircrew will preflight NVDs prior to each
   use to ensure proper operation and optimum night visual enhancement. MAJCOMs will
   prescribe the use of NVDs during aircraft operations. See also paragraph 6.3.3.
   5.12.3. (USAFE) Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations. NVD operations will be
   conducted IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, AFI 11-2MDSV3
   guidance, and MDS-specific AFTTPs.
   5.12.4. Night Approaches. MAJCOMs shall determine procedures governing the use of
   instrument approaches while operating in night VMC.
   5.12.4. (USAFE) Night Approaches. Unless otherwise directed in AFI 11-2MDSV3 or
   local procedures, night VMC approaches/landings will be accomplished using the following
   availability priority (or as required based on mission/training requirements):
       5.12.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Precision Approach.
       5.12.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Non-precision Approach.
       5.12.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Visual straight-in.
       5.12.4.4. (Added-USAFE) A VFR traffic pattern may be flown if an instrument
       approach is not available and safety would be compromised by flying a visual straight-in
       (i.e. due to obstacles, population centers, etc.). Rotary wing aircraft may accomplish
       visual approaches to a designated helipad.
5.13. Landing Gear Reporting Procedures. Pilots operating retractable gear aircraft must
report "gear down" to the ATC agency or runway supervisory unit after extending the landing
gear. This report shall be made during any approach to an airport prior to crossing the runway
threshold.
5.14. Altitude Requirements. Except for MAJCOM-approved aerial demonstrations/events or
during takeoff or landing, do not operate aircraft:
   5.14.1. Emergency Landing. Below an altitude that, should an emergency landing become
   necessary, creates undue hazard to persons or property.
   5.14.2. VFR. Above 3,000 ft. AGL under VFR at altitudes or flight levels other than those
   specified in FLIP. In airspace under FAA jurisdiction, these altitudes do not apply when
   turning or holding in a holding pattern of 2 minutes or less.
 46                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


   5.14.3. Congested Areas. Over congested areas (i.e., cities, towns, settlements) or groups
   of people if the altitude does not ensure at least 1,000 ft. above the highest obstacle within a
   2,000-ft. radius of the aircraft. Pilots flying helicopters in FAA airspace or operating IAW
   host nation agreements may operate at lower altitudes and in closer proximity if they do not
   create a hazard to persons or property on the surface.
   5.14.4. Non-congested Areas. Over non-congested areas at an altitude of less than 500 ft.
   AGL except over open water, in special use airspace (SUA), or in sparsely populated areas.
   Under such exceptions, pilots must not operate aircraft closer than 500 ft. to any person,
   vessel, vehicle, or structure. Pilots flying helicopters in FAA airspace may operate at lower
   altitudes and in closer proximity if they do not create a hazard to persons or property on the
   surface.
   5.14.4. (USAFE) Non-congested Areas. In the UK this guidance also applies anytime
   aircraft are under ―Traffic Service‖ or ―Deconfliction Service.‖ ―SUA‖ also includes all HN-
   defined low level operating airspace/routes as defined in HN AIPs. USAFE rotary-wing
   aircraft will operate IAW HN rules/agreements and local guidance.
   5.14.5. Flight over National Recreation Areas and Wildlife Refuges. Less than 2,000 ft.
   AGL (mission permitting) over: National Park Service monuments, seashores, lake shores,
   recreation and scenic river ways; US Fish and Wildlife Service refuges and ranges; and US
   Forest Service wilderness and primitive areas. This paragraph is not applicable to SUA, low-
   altitude tactical navigation areas and MTRs. Specific areas may require higher altitudes (see
   FLIP and sectional aeronautical charts).
   5.14.5. (USAFE) Flight        over National   Recreation    Areas     and     Wildlife
   Refuges. Reference HN AIPs for minimum altitudes over HN-designated national parks and
   wildlife refuges (or equivalent).
   5.14.6. Disaster Areas. Within a designated disaster area unless the aircraft is: aiding the
   area, specifically cleared by ATC or can fly to or from an airport in the area without
   hampering or endangering relief activities. Pilots must check NOTAMS for disaster areas.
5.15. Altimeter Settings. Set altimeters according to FLIP GP, FIH and AP-series documents.
Use temperature correction tables when appropriate. Flight in IMC below FL 180 is not
permitted in any area where the barometric pressure is lower than 28 or higher than 31 inches of
mercury (See AIM 7-2-1 for more information).
5.15. (USAFE)Altimeter Settings. Altimeter settings in this guidance does not include QFE.
5.16. Simulated Instrument Flight.
   5.16.1. Restrictions. The following restrictions apply to simulated instrument flight:
       5.16.1.1. The aircraft must be equipped with a functional two-way radio.
       5.16.1.2. A safety observer, able to see outside at all times, should accompany the flight,
       either as a crewmember or in a chase aircraft. If a chase aircraft is used, maintain
       continuous visual contact and two-way communications between aircraft. A safety
       observer is defined as an instrument qualified pilot, a fighter weapons systems operator
       (or other MAJCOM-designated aircrew member) with access to a set of flight controls.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                                47


      5.16.1.3. MAJCOMs may authorize UAS to conduct simulated instrument flight
      provided the aircraft has sense and avoid capabilities as outlined in paragraph 5.4.2.
   5.16.2. Practice Instrument Approaches. Approaches conducted in other than actual IMC.
   The pilot must still be able to see the ground, surrounding terrain, and when established on
   the final segment of the approach, the airport environment. Practice instrument approaches,
   including approaches flown under VFR will be conducted IAW Chapter 8 of this instruction.
   Practice approaches may be conducted without a safety observer (as defined in paragraph
   5.16.1.2) if the pilot is instrument qualified and current in the type of approach flown. When
   flying a practice approach without a safety observer, the pilot must maintain a composite
   crosscheck that maintains situational awareness with terrain and other traffic. The pilot is not
   relieved of the responsibility to see and avoid other traffic, terrain and obstacles.
   5.16.3. Vision Restricting Devices. MAJCOMs must approve the use of vision restricting
   devices (e.g., hoods, Foggles, etc) and provide specific approval for their use during takeoffs
   and landings. Vision restricting devices will not be used without a safety observer.
   5.16.3. (USAFE) Vision Restricting Devices. USAFE units may delegate approval
   authority for the use of vision restricted devices to no lower than the OG/CC.
      5.16.3.1. Maintain at least 2,000 ft of obstruction clearance when using vision restricting
      devices if the safety observer is in a chase aircraft, is not qualified as a pilot, or does not
      have full view of the flight instruments and access to the flight controls.
5.17. Simulated Emergency Flight Procedures:
   5.17.1. Restrictions. The following restrictions apply to simulated emergencies:
      5.17.1.1. Do not practice emergency procedures with passengers on board. Non-flight
      deck crewmembers may accomplish emergency procedures or medical emergency
      training with passengers on board provided there is no interference with the cockpit crew
      and mission requirements.
      5.17.1.2. Single pilot aircraft require day (including civil twilight), VMC.
      5.17.1.3. Multi-pilot aircraft in day IMC require weather conditions at or above
      published circling minimums for the approach to be flown.
      5.17.1.4. Multi-pilot aircraft at night require weather conditions at or above 1,000 ft.
      ceiling and 2 SMs visibility or circling minimums, whichever is higher.
      5.17.1.5. (Added-USAFE) Except as authorized/restricted in AFI 11-2MDSV3, USAFE
      aircrew will adhere to the following additional guidance concerning simulated EPs.
          5.17.1.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Unusual attitude recoveries may only be conducted in
          VMC and when a flight examiner or IP has immediate access to the flight controls.
          5.17.1.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Do not perform actual engine shutdown in-flight (see
          paragraph 5.17.3.3).

   (https://etca.randolph.af.mil/).
5.19. Dropping Parachutists or Objects or Fuel Jettison. The PIC will not allow the
dropping of parachutists or objects, or jettison of fuel from the aircraft except in an emergency or
when required for mission accomplishment.
5.19. (USAFE) Dropping Parachutists or Objects or Fuel Jettison. ―Fuel jettison‖ in this
and subsequent paragraphs refers to the dumping of fuel using TO fuel dumping procedures, not
the jettisoning of external fuel tanks (if applicable).
   5.19.1. MAJCOM Responsibilities. MAJCOMs will ensure airdrops comply with
   applicable directives.
   5.19.1. (USAFE) MAJCOM Responsibilities. USAFE aircrew will only perform airdrops
   IAW the following guidance:
       5.19.1.1. (Added-USAFE) AFI 11-2MDSV3 (including any referenced AFIs)
       5.19.1.2. (Added-USAFE) AFI 16-1202, Pararescue Operations, Techniques, and
       Procedures, (once published, AFI 10-3502V3 will be referenced due to its incorporation
       of AFI 16-1202 guidance).
       5.19.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Local supplements to the above AFI guidance
       5.19.1.4. (Added-USAFE) MDS-specific AFTTPs
   5.19.2. PIC Responsibilities. The PIC will:
       5.19.2.1. When jettisoning fuel and circumstances permit, notify the appropriate ATC or
       flight service facility of intentions, altitude, location, and when the operation is complete.
       5.19.2.1. (USAFE) Planned fuel dumping will be reported to HN ATC IAW HN rules
       and agreements.
       5.19.2.2. Drop chaff containing rope elements IAW AFI 13-201 and JO 7610.4.
       5.19.2.2. (USAFE) Since JO 7610.4 is only applicable within the NAS, outside the NAS
       aircrew will follow HN rules and agreements concerning rope chaff.
       5.19.2.3. Report any accidental loss of equipment or aircraft parts or jettisoning of fuel
       or cargo IAW AFMAN 10-206, Operational Reporting, and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation
       Safety Investigations and Reports.
       5.19.2.3. (USAFE) IAW AFI 10-206, aircrew will only report ―jettisoning of fuel‖ (i.e.
       fuel dumping) if fuel is released from the aircraft either intentionally or unintentionally
       and it is ―likely to have adverse environmental consequences or elicit media coverage.‖
       Unless otherwise stated in AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, or HN guidance, aircrew will use
 50                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


       10,000 ft AGL as the altitude below which ―environmental consequences‖ from fuel
       leakage/dumping may be a factor and therefore will report IAW AFI 10-206.
5.20. Aircraft Lighting.
   5.20.1. Reduced Lighting. MAJCOMs may authorize reduced or light-out operations in
   restricted areas, warning areas or host nation approved areas. Host nation approved areas
   may be documented in a LOA or host nation regulatory documentation.
   5.20.1. (USAFE) Reduced Lighting. USAFE authorizes reduced/lights-out operations
   IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3 and AFI 11-214 guidance as well as HN rules/agreements. If an LOA
   is required due to a lack of HN regulatory documentation, the OG/CC will ensure the LOA is
   reviewed annually for currency.
   5.20.2. Aircraft Lighting During Formation Operations. MAJCOMs may authorize
   formation flights to vary their lighting configuration according to the aircraft type and
   mission requirement. The MAJCOM must provide guidance on this type of operation and
   ensure the guidance provides an equivalent level of visual identification as a single aircraft.
   5.20.2. (USAFE) Aircraft Lighting During Formation Operations. USAFE authorizes
   formation flights to vary their lighting configuration IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, and HN
   guidance as well as MDS-specific AFTTPs. This also applies to tanker operations (reference
   ATP-56).
   5.20.3. Position Lights. Illuminate all position lights between official sunset and sunrise:
       5.20.3.1. Immediately before engine start and when an engine is running. Aircraft that
       do not have power available before start shall turn them on as soon as power is available.
       5.20.3.2. When parked in an area likely to create a hazard or while being towed, unless
       clearly illuminated by an outside source.
   5.20.4. Anticollision and Strobe Lights. Anticollision lights and strobe lights are not the
   same. For the purposes of this section, anti-collision lights are the primary flashing light
   system on the aircraft intended to attract the attention of others to enhance see and avoid
   operations, while strobe lights are systems such as wingtip strobes or other similar strobe
   light installations.
       5.20.4.1. Ground Operations. Aircraft equipped with anticollision lights will display
       these lights IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground.
       5.20.4.2. Airborne Operations. Aircraft equipped with anticollision and strobe lights
       will operate these lights as follows:
          5.20.4.2.1. Anticollision lights must be on from takeoff to landing.
          5.20.4.2.2. Strobe lights shall be operated IAW MAJCOM or aircraft T.O. guidance.
          5.20.4.2.3. The PIC may turn off anticollision lights when required for safety.
          5.20.4.2.4. The PIC may continue a mission with the failure of any light of the
          anticollision light system to the first practical stop where repairs can be made.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                             51


   5.20.5. Landing Lights. Aircraft must have at least one operable landing light. Helicopters
   equipped with a searchlight that provides sufficient light for landing may substitute that for
   an operable landing light. Covert landing lights meet this requirement during NVD use.
       5.20.5.1. Landing lights will be illuminated below 10,000 ft. MSL, day or night, within
       operational constraints.
       5.20.5.2. When mission requirements dictate, use of landing lights is optional during
       take-off/landing, if the aircraft is equipped with an operational sensor that provides a
       visual representation of the runway environment. Operations must comply with
       paragraph 5.12.1.
       5.20.5.3. When other aircraft are operating in the pattern, landing light off operations
       should be limited to specific training and operational requirements.
5.21. Aerobatics and Air Combat Tactics. Aerobatics, air combat tactics and air to ground
tactics which involve aerobatic type maneuvering must be performed in SUA, ATC-Assigned
Airspace (ATCAA), MTRs or host nation approved airspace IAW the guidelines in AFI 11-214,
Aircrew, Weapons Director, and Terminal Attack Controller Procedures for Air Operations.
Aircraft deployed or based at overseas locations will operate IAW applicable host nation
agreements or ICAO SARPs. If the aircraft operating requirements (altitude requirements,
maximum airspeeds, dropping of objects, etc) dictated in the host nation agreement are less
restrictive than USAF/MAJCOM guidance, the most restrictive guidance shall be used.
5.21. (USAFE) Aerobatics and Air Combat Tactics. In the UK, aerobatics and ACT may also
be performed anytime aircraft are under ―Traffic‖ or ―Deconfliction‖ Service (reference UK MIL
AIP). ―SUA‖ also includes all HN-defined low level operating airspace/routes as defined in HN
AIPs.
5.22. Participating in Aerial Events.
   5.22.1. The PIC will ensure compliance with AFI 11-209, when participating in aerial
   events, demonstrations, and static displays.
       5.22.1.1. (Added-USAFE) See also paragraph 5.6.3 (Added).
   5.22.2. When a NOTAM imposes a TFR during an airshow, major sporting event, natural
   disaster, etc, no aircraft may operate in the designated airspace except IAW the authorization,
   terms and conditions of the TFR.
5.23. Tobacco Use on USAF Aircraft. Tobacco use is prohibited on USAF or contract aircraft.
5.24. Landing With Hot Armament. MAJCOMs will ensure units develop procedures for
handling aircraft that land with live armament to ensure the safe conduct of such operations.
   5.24.1. Before landing with hot armament or practice munitions at any airfield where such
   procedures are not known, the PIC must:
       5.24.1.1. Advise the tower of the circumstances, and
       5.24.1.2. Advise transient alert and other appropriate agencies, and
       5.24.1.3. Request taxi instructions to a designated safe (de-arm) area.
   5.24.2. After landing, the PIC must:
 52                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


       5.24.2.1. Avoid taxiing into an area that could threaten personnel or equipment, and
       5.24.2.2. Ensure the ground crew is aware of the armament on board, and
       5.24.2.3. Request assistance from the nearest Air Force facility, if necessary.
   5.24.3. (Added-USAFE) Units will execute landings with live and/or practice heavyweight
   ordnance IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, and HN guidance as well as MDS-specific AFTTPs.
   Additionally, aircrew will review procedures at HN divert/alternate fields when required to
   proceed to those fields.
5.25. Pilot Reporting Procedures. In addition to the reporting requirements listed elsewhere in
this instruction, AIM, AFMAN 11-217 series, or ICAO/host-nation instructions, pilots will
report:
   5.25.1. Position. Pilots will report their position as requested by ATC and as required by
   host-nation or ICAO flight procedures in uncontrolled airspace. Use the position reporting
   format found in the En route Supplement.
   5.25.2. Hazardous Laser Activity. Pilots will report any hazardous laser activity
   encounters IAW AIM 7-5-12 and AP/1. Laser encounters can be extremely perilous, see AFI
   11-301, Volume 4, Aircrew Laser Eye Protection, for specific aircrew actions and more
   information on protection from laser illumination.
   5.25.2. (USAFE) Hazardous Laser Activity. Aircrew may find current AIM
   documentation at the following link: http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/. Under
   ―Manuals‖ select the most current version of the AIM.
       5.25.2.1. (Added-USAFE) In addition to the reporting in paragraph 5.25.2., aircrew will
       report to applicable HN military liaisons IAW local and HN rules and agreements any
       unauthorized and/or suspected malicious LASER activity.
   5.25.3. Pilot Reports (PIREPs). Pilots will immediately report hazardous weather
   conditions, volcanic activity, and large concentrations of birds or wildlife on or near the
   airport/airfield to the ARTCC, terminal ATC, or FSS. Additionally, pilots are urged to report
   any significant flight condition information. Pilots operating in warning areas should
   forward significant weather reports to the appropriate controlling agency (e.g., ARTCC,
   military radar unit, Airborne Warning and Control System, etc). In all cases, follow up with
   a report to a Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV) to ensure rapid dissemination to other using
   agencies. See PIREP procedures in the FIH.
   5.25.3. (USAFE) Pilot Reports (PIREPs). See Attachment 8 (Added) for a definition of
   ―Volcanic Activity‖
5.26. Operations in the vicinity of hazards. Unless MAJCOM-approved, USAF aircraft will
not be operated in any forecast or actual severe condition (e.g. severe icing, turbulence, actual
Bird Watch Condition SEVERE, etc). See AFH 11-203 and AFI 91-202 for detailed information.
5.26. (USAFE)Operations in the vicinity of hazards. USAFE authorizes flight operations in
forecast or actual severe conditions IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3 and TO guidance if necessary for the
accomplishment of HHQ-tasked/contingency missions (i.e. not for daily training) and approved
by the following authorities: CAF--owning OG/CC or designated representative, MAF--owning
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                              53


AOC/CC or comparable level of flying supervision if agreed upon between the owning AOC and
the unit.
   5.26.1. Takeoff, Approach, and Landing. Pilots will not takeoff, land, or fly an approach
   at an airport where thunderstorms or other hazardous conditions are producing hail, strong
   winds, gust fronts, heavy rain, lightning, windshear, and (or) microbursts.
      5.26.1.1. Bird Watch Condition (BWC). In the absence of MAJCOM or MDS-specific
      BWC guidance, USAF pilots will comply with the following:
      5.26.1.2. BWC MODERATE: Operational commanders will consider restricting
      formation departures, approaches, and pattern work. To increase the chances of seeing
      and avoiding birds, PICs should avoid hard turns or excessive climb angles. During
      BWC Phase II periods, PICs will accomplish one approach to a full stop unless mission
      needs warrant additional approaches and sufficient fuel exists to divert if BWC changes
      to SEVERE.
      5.26.1.3. BWC SEVERE: PICs shall not conduct flight operations except in an
      emergency. Arriving aircraft will either hold awaiting a lower BWC, or will divert.
      Non-emergency landings in BWC SEVERE require risk acceptance approval by the
      operations group commander (or airbase wing commander if no OG/CC) responsible for
      the airfield’s flight operations.
      5.26.1.4. Civil or Foreign Fields. PICs will follow BWC MODERATE procedures if
      they receive a civilian ATC/ATIS hazard advisory to use caution for birds in the vicinity.
      5.26.1.5. PICs can expect NATO countries to comply with NATO STANAG 3879. Use
      this intensity conversion: 0-4: low, 5: medium, 6-8: severe. Risks warning updates for
      NW Europe can be obtained via: https://www.notams.jcs.mil/common/birdtam.html.
          5.26.1.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Squadrons flying low-level missions in central Europe
          will ensure current applicable BIRDTAM (or HN equivalent system) information is
          made available to aircrews during mission planning. Airfield management at USAFE
          owned/operated bases will ensure current BIRDTAM (or HN equivalent system)
          information is available to all transient aircrews as necessary for their planned
          missions.
          5.26.1.5.2. (Added-USAFE) When BIRDTAM levels 6/7/8 (or HN equivalent) is
          declared, aircrews are prohibited from low-level training below 2000 ft AGL in the
          affected area(s). If notified while airborne, aircrews will adjust route of flight and or
          altitude to avoid those areas. If a BIRDTAM (or HN equivalent) is reported in a grid
          that includes a USAFE base, supervisors of flying (SOF) and airfield management
          personnel will assess the current local bird activity and adjust the Bird Watch
          Condition accordingly.
   5.26.2. Thunderstorms. Pilots shall not intentionally operate into a thunderstorm except
   when operating on a MAJCOM-approved mission specifically requiring thunderstorm
   penetration. Damaging lightning strikes, electrostatic discharges and hail encounters can
   occur in apparently benign conditions. Pilots shall not fly in IMC in the vicinity of actual
   thunderstorms without operable radar, unless specifically approved by the MAJCOM.

  5.26.2. (USAFE) Thunderstorms. ―In the vicinity‖ is defined as within 10 NM below
  FL230 or within 20 NM above FL 230. An ―Operable radar‖ can be any of the following:
     5.26.2.1. (Added-USAFE) An on-board system that possesses the capability to provide
     any type of weather returns.
     5.26.2.2. (Added-USAFE) In contact with a ground or airborne controller who, with
     their radar, is capable of painting weather that could be a factor to the flight.
     5.26.2.3. (Added-USAFE) If in-formation, at least one member of the flight is capable
     of painting the weather and communicating hazards to the rest of the flight.
  5.26.3. Flight Planned Route. When forecast, observed or reported hazardous weather
  activity (thunderstorm or other severe weather condition) affects the planned route, pilots
  will alter the route of flight to avoid the hazard, delay the scheduled mission or proceed to a
  suitable alternate. Pilots shall use all available information including ground and on-board
  radar, PMSV, and PIREPs to avoid hazardous or severe weather conditions.
  5.26.3. (USAFE) Flight Planned Route. Aircrew will be mindful of the increased risk of
  electrostatic discharge when flying in visible moisture (clouds or precipitation) at or near the
  freezing level from (i.e. +8 to -8 degrees Celsius and/or within 5,000 feet) and will avoid to
  the max extent practical.
  5.26.4. Wake Turbulence and Windshear. Pilots will:
     5.26.4.1. Report Wake Turbulence. Notify ATC when encountering wake turbulence.
     Pilots should observe wake turbulence avoidance criteria in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 3,
     Supplemental Flight Information, and FLIP.
     5.26.4.2. Report Windshear. Immediately report a windshear or microburst encounter
     on takeoff, approach or landing to the most appropriate agency (e.g., control tower,
     approach control, PMSV) and if possible include: the altitude, loss or gain in airspeed or
     altitude, the type of aircraft and the location of occurrence (see AFH 11-203, Volume 1).
  5.26.5. Volcanic Activity. Unless conducting rescue operations or when authorized by the
  MAJCOM/A3, pilots of Air Force aircraft will not operate in an area of known or reported
  hazardous volcanic activity. MAJCOMS may issue MDS-specific guidance on ground and
  flight operations, including pilot actions for inadvertent ash encounters and ash avoidance
  criteria for areas of known or forecast hazardous volcanic ash concentrations. In the absence
  of MAJCOM guidance, pilots shall not plan to operate within 50 NM of any hazardous
  volcanic ash without MAJCOM/A3 approval. Consult an authorized weather source (see
  para. 2.6.) for current Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) ash cloud information (or
  SIGMET). If unable to contact an authorized weather source, pilots will consider those areas
  identified on international VAAC depictions (or SIGMETs) as hazardous. In ground or flight
  operations, any encounters with volcanic ash should be reported as soon as possible to the
  appropriate controlling agency and aircraft maintenance authorities. In all cases, follow up
  with a report to a PMSV, or other applicable weather agency, to ensure rapid dissemination
  to other using agencies. See PIREP procedures in the FIH.
  5.26.5. (USAFE) Volcanic Activity. See Attachment 8 (Added) for USAFE guidance on
  operations near Volcanic Activity.

   5.26.6. Freezing Precipitation (Ice/Snow/Frost). Pilots will not takeoff with ice, snow,
   frost or other contamination adhering to the wings, control surfaces, propellers, engine inlets,
   or other critical surfaces of the aircraft, unless authorized by the program manager or flight
   manual.
      5.26.6.1. A thin coating of frost is permitted on the fuselage, provided the lettering
      and/or paint lines are visible.
      5.26.6.2. Light frost (up to 1/8 inch thick) caused by supercooled fuel is permitted on the
      lower wing surface (i.e., below the fuel tank area) if the fuselage and all other control
      surfaces are free of all icing. If deicing is required on any other aircraft surface, the
      underwing frost shall also be removed.
      5.26.6.3. Information on the removal and prevention of frozen precipitation is contained
      in AF T.O. 42C-1-2, Anti-Icing, De-Icing and Defrosting of Parked Aircraft available at
      https://www.toindex-s.wpafb.af.mil.
          5.26.6.3.1. Approved annual deicing/anti-icing holdover tables are available at the
          HQ AFFSA/A3OF website: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/a3of.
          5.26.6.3.1. (USAFE) For further guidance, reference the most current USAFE FCIF
          titled ―Cold Weather Procedures/Holdover Tables)‖ as posted on the USAFE/A3TV
          ICE ( https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/A3/A3T/A3TV_External/default.aspx).
5.27. Traffic Alerting and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). Aircraft equipped with
TCAS shall operate in the TCAS mode that provides both Traffic Alerts (TAs) and Resolution
Advisories (RAs) unless the provisions of paragraph 5.27.2, MAJCOM guidance, mission
requirements or host nation agreements dictate otherwise.
   5.27.1. Response to TCAS Alerts. Pilots shall respond to all RAs as directed by the TCAS
   system unless doing so would jeopardize the safe operation of the aircraft (e.g., descent into
   obstacles).
      5.27.1.1. Pilots shall not deviate from an assigned ATC clearance based solely on TA
      information. Attempt to attain visual contact and maintain safe separation.
      5.27.1.2. In the event of an RA, alter the flight path only to the extent necessary to
      comply with the RA.
      5.27.1.3. Pilots who deviate from an ATC clearance in response to an RA shall notify
      ATC of the deviation as soon as practical and promptly return to the current ATC
      clearance when the traffic conflict is resolved or obtain a new clearance.
      5.27.1.4. If a TCAS RA requires maneuvering contrary to ATC instructions, right-of-
      way rules, cloud clearance requirements, or other VFR/IFR flight rules, pilots are
      expected to follow the TCAS RA.
   5.27.2. Formation TCAS Operations.
      5.27.2.1. Formation leads (and last aircraft, when formation length exceeds 3 NMs) shall
      operate in TA mode unless otherwise required by ATC, host nation agreement or
      specified in the MDS specific guidance.
      5.27.2.2. During refueling operations the tanker aircraft will operate in TA mode.
 56                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


   5.27.3. UAS TCAS Operations. RPAs equipped with TCAS shall only operate in TA
   Mode unless specifically authorized by competent authority.
5.28. Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (TAWS). Pilots will comply with
appropriate flight manual procedures upon receipt of a Ground Proximity Warning System
(GPWS)/TAWS/Enhanced GPWS (EGPWS)/Ground Collision Avoidance System (GCAS)
warning. During day/VMC flight, terrain warnings need not be followed if the pilot can verify
the warning is false by visual contact with the terrain/obstacle.
   5.28.1. MAJCOMs will establish guidance on TAWS use during tactical operations.
   5.28.1. (USAFE) Aircrew will follow AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, and TO guidance as well as
   MDS-specific AFTTPs concerning the tactical use of GPWS/EGPWS/TAWS/GCAS.
5.29. Navigation Procedures for Higher Latitudes. (See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1)
   5.29.1. Aircraft capable of displaying only magnetic heading are prohibited from operating
   in designated Areas of Magnetic Unreliability (AMU). For areas north of 70 N and south of
   60 S that are not officially designated as AMUs, MAJCOMs will determine the highest
   allowable latitude for aircraft capable of displaying only magnetic heading.
       5.29.1.1. MAJCOMs must provide aircraft-specific operational approval prior to en route
       and terminal area operations using navigation aids oriented to true or grid.
       5.29.1.1. (USAFE) Aircrew will follow AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, and TO guidance as
       well as MDS-specific AFTTPs.
       5.29.1.2. Outside of AMUs, aircraft unable to display true or grid heading may use
       navigation aids oriented to true or grid for en route navigation if allowed by MAJCOM.
       5.29.1.2. (USAFE) Aircrew are allowed to operate IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, and
       TO guidance as well as MDS-specific AFTTPs.
   5.29.2. Unless otherwise restricted by aircraft flight manual or MAJCOM directives, USAF
   aircrews are authorized to fly true or grid approaches.
       5.29.2.1. Except as noted in paragraph 5.29.2.2 aircraft must possess a true or grid
       heading source, and be able to display true or grid heading on appropriate navigation
       displays in order to fly terminal area true or grid instrument procedures in night or IMC.
       5.29.2.2. Aircraft without a true or grid heading source may fly true or grid RNAV
       (GPS) approaches and true or grid RNAV departure procedures at night or IMC provided
       the RNAV procedure includes all required magnetic course information.
5.30. UAS Abnormal Flight Operations. If ATC loses the RPA transponder signal or the
ability to determine the position or altitude of the RPA, the pilot will declare an emergency,
attempt to transmit IFF code 7700 (or 7600, if appropriate), terminate the mission, and proceed
to either home station or the nearest suitable DoD-controlled airspace/airfield for landing. The
pilot will state intentions to ATC and also provide ATC with position reports when requested for
tracking.
   5.30.1. In the event of a divert, the pilot will coordinate a route of flight and new clearance
   with ATC that minimizes any hazard to other air traffic and persons on the ground.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                              57


5.31. UAS Lost-Link Procedures. Upon confirmation of a sustained loss of command link, the
PIC will accomplish appropriate lost link procedures and notify ATC with the following
information: time of lost link, last known position, altitude, and programmed lost link routing.
The PIC shall confirm execution of appropriate lost link procedures with ATC or other means, if
practical.
   5.31.1. The PIC will ensure the RPA is programmed to follow a predictable route and
   altitude plan if it loses link. If practical, lost link routing will be programmed to maintain
   either the RPA’s last assigned clearance or include a delay to enable coordination with ATC
   prior to aircraft departing its approved working area. The PIC shall attempt to regain
   command link and will notify ATC of anticipated aircraft maneuvers. Lost link routing shall
   be planned to ensure that the aircraft has sufficient obstacle clearance and does not penetrate
   unauthorized airspace.
   5.31.2. Lost link routing will terminate in an area that provides the best chance to regain link
   or at a landing/recovery airfield. If unable to reestablish link, and in absence of MAJCOM-
   specific guidance, the PIC will inform ATC of the intended flight termination plan.

AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                            59


6.4. Oxygen Requirements. (N/A for UAS ground control stations) The PIC shall ensure
sufficient oxygen for the planned mission (including contingencies) is available to all occupants
before takeoff. Normally, aircrew will use supplemental oxygen anytime the cabin altitude
exceeds 10,000 ft MSL.
   6.4.1. Unpressurized Operations. When mission essential, aircrew trained IAW AFI 11-
   403, Aerospace Physiological Training Program, may operate aircraft unpressurized above
   10,000 ft. MSL without supplemental oxygen IAW MAJCOM guidance and the following
   restrictions:
   6.4.1. (USAFE) Unpressurized Operations. USAFE approves unpressurized operations
   above 10,000 ft MSL IAW parent AFI, AFI 11-2MDSV3, and TO guidance as well as MDS-
   specific AFTTPs. If no guidance exists, units must request approval from USAFE/A3 IAW
   paragraph 1.6.1.4
       6.4.1.1. Total flight time (without supplemental oxygen) above 10,000 ft. MSL shall not
       exceed 1 hour if any portion of the flight above 10,000 ft. MSL is in IMC, at night, or
       when using NVGs, employing weapons, conducting airdrop or air-refueling, or
       performing high-g maneuvers.
       6.4.1.2. Maximum of 30 minutes (without supplemental oxygen) between 12,500 and
       14,000 ft. MSL.
       6.4.1.3. Supplemental oxygen must be used by all persons while above 14,000 ft. MSL.
       6.4.1.4. Any occupant, not trained IAW AFI 11-403, limits the cabin altitude to:
           6.4.1.4.1. 10,000 ft. to 13,000 ft. MSL for three hours without supplemental oxygen.
           6.4.1.4.2. 13,000 ft. MSL without supplemental oxygen.
       6.4.1.5. FL 250 shall not be exceeded even if occupants have oxygen (see paragraph 6.5)
   6.4.2. Pressurized Operations. Pilots flying pressurized aircraft maintaining a cabin
   altitude below 10,000 ft. will comply with Table 6.2. Each crewmember shall use
   supplemental oxygen anytime the cabin altitude exceeds 10,000 ft MSL.
       6.4.2.1. (Added-USAFE) IAW AFFSA waiver titled ―Oxygen Requirement Waiver,‖
       aircrew of C-37 (all variants) aircraft may conduct flights above FL410 without one pilot
       donning an oxygen mask under the following provisions. Reference the ―Waivers‖ folder
       on the USAFE/A3TV ICE for the most current version of the waiver document.
           6.4.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Crews will limit exposure to higher altitudes by
           planning all missions at or below FL410. Any missions planned at altitudes above
           FL410 due to max range fuel considerations (up to FL450) require USAFE/A3
           approval (make requests IAW paragraph 1.6.1.4)
           6.4.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) During flight, should fuel reserves or flight conditions
           that cannot be circumnavigated (reported or forecast moderate or greater turbulence
           or severe weather), necessitate a climb above FL410, and mission requirements
           preclude the use of oxygen at altitude, C-37 AlB crews may operate up to FL450 with
           oxygen immediately available to both pilots under the following restrictions:
              6.4.2.1.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Both pilots will occupy their duty positions.
 60                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


              6.4.2.1.2.2. (Added-USAFE) The Emergency Descent Mode (EDM) must be
              functional.
              6.4.2.1.2.3. (Added-USAFE) The autopilot must be engaged and functional in
              each axis.
              6.4.2.1.2.4. (Added-USAFE) The auto-throttles must be engaged and functional.
              6.4.2.1.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Internal baggage door must remain closed.
           6.4.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Flights over terrain greater than 13,000 feet MSL
           require one pilot to be continually on oxygen if the aircraft is above FL410.
           6.4.2.1.4. (Added-USAFE) If all the above criteria cannot be met, one pilot will don
           an oxygen mask IAW Table 6.1. below. Additionally, if the cabin pressure low
           warning message illuminates at or above FL400, activating the EDM, the crew will
           take the following actions:
              6.4.2.1.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Crew Oxygen Masks -Don (All)
              6.4.2.1.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Speed Brakes -Extend (P or FE)
              6.4.2.1.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Emergency Descent Procedures -Initiate (PF)
           6.4.2.1.5. (Added-USAFE) All flights above FL410 will be reported to the SQ/DO
           or designated representative and tracked.
   6.4.3. Procedures for Loss of Cabin Pressure. Initiate an immediate descent to the lowest
   practical altitude, preferably below 18,000 ft. MSL, but do not allow cabin altitude to remain
   above FL 250 unless occupants are wearing functional pressure suits. If any occupant lacks
   functioning oxygen equipment, descend to an altitude of 13,000 ft MSL or less (terrain
   permitting) and comply with paragraph 6.4.1.
       6.4.3.1. If cabin altitude exceeds 18,000 ft MSL following the unintended loss of cabin
       pressure, aircrew and passengers must be evaluated by a flight surgeon or other
       competent aviation medical authority prior to further flight. If cabin altitude cannot be
       determined, use the aircraft altitude at the time of the event. Report a loss of cabin
       pressurization IAW AFMAN 91-223.
   6.4.4. Decompression Sickness (DCS). If any occupant exhibits DCS symptoms, the pilot
   must descend as soon as practical and land at the nearest suitable installation where medical
   assistance can be obtained. Individuals suspected of DCS should be administered and remain
   on 100 percent oxygen (using tight-fitting mask or equivalent) until evaluated by competent
   aviation medical authority. Decompression sickness may occur up to 12 hours after landing.
   Aircrew will not fly after a DCS event without specific authorization from a flight surgeon or
   designated civil aviation medical examiner.
   6.4.5. Hypoxia. Should anyone on the aircraft experience hypoxia symptoms, the pilot will
   immediately descend to the lowest practical altitude and land at a suitable location to obtain
   medical assistance. Aircrew will not fly after a hypoxia event without specific authorization
   from a flight surgeon or designated civil aviation medical examiner.
6.5. High Altitude Operations. Without a functional pressure suit, the pilot shall maintain a
cabin altitude below FL 250 and adhere to the time limits in Table 6.1. For high-altitude airdrop
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                             61


missions, use the oxygen requirements in AFI 11-409, High Altitude Mission Support
Procedures. If the aircraft lands between missions, and the time on the ground equals or exceeds
the time spent at or above a cabin altitude of FL 210, the time of allowable duration can be reset
to the maximum.

  LEGEND:
 A - Oxygen available. Carry or place portable oxygen units or extra oxygen outlets with masks
 throughout the cabin/cargo area so that any person has quick access to oxygen should a loss of
 pressurization occur.
 R - Oxygen readily available. A functioning system and mask shall be located within arms
 reach, and the regulator must be set to 100 percent and ON (when regulator is adjustable).
 I - Oxygen immediately available. Must wear helmets with an oxygen mask attached to one
 side, or have available an approved quick-don style mask properly adjusted and positioned.
 Regulators shall be set to 100 percent and ON.
 O - Oxygen mask ON. Regulator ON and normal.
 G - Wear a partial pressure suit. Suit must provide 70mm Hg of assisted positive pressure
 breathing for altitude (pressure breathing for altitude system/get-me-down scenario)
 S – Wear a pressure suit. Suit must provide a total pressure (atmospheric plus suit differential)
 of at least 141mm Hg to the head and neck with adequate body coverage to prevent edema and
 embolism.



6.6. (Added-USAFE) Wind and Sea State Restrictions for Ejection Seat Aircraft. Flying
training operations will not be conducted when the surface winds along the intended route of
flight exceed 35 knots steady state over land (25 knots over water) or when the sea state exceeds
4 meters wave height. This is not intended to restrict point-to-point operations (e.g. ocean
crossings) when only a portion of the route is affected and the flight planned route can be altered
to avoid the affected area. The OG/CC or designated representative is the waiver authority.

                                           Chapter 7

                              VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR)

7.1. General Information. PICs may fly USAF aircraft under VFR when required for mission
accomplishment. Mission examples include: operational necessity, host nation requirements,
training, proficiency or evaluation sorties, aircraft equipment that precludes IFR flight; and ATC
or NAVAID gaps that preclude IFR flight. Unless specifically authorized by the MAJCOM/A3,
USAF fixed-wing multi-engine aircraft will not depart VFR without ensuring they can vertically
clear published IFR departure procedure restrictions along the planned departure route with one
engine inoperative. Comply with AFMAN 11-217, Volume 2, and the following:
7.1. (USAFE)General Information. Make requests for the authorization allowed in paragraph
7.1. IAW paragraph 1.6.1.4. (written) or 1.6.1.5. (verbal). For all authorizations, aircrew must
brief obstacle avoidance maneuvers in case of OEI and must be able to see-and-avoid all
obstacles along their route of flight that drive published IFR departure restrictions.
   7.1.1. The PIC will utilize radar advisory, monitoring or control services when practical, and
   should ensure flight following by any available means (i.e. FSS or C2 agency).
   7.1.1. (USAFE) Aircrew will use HN VFR radar services to the max extent practical, but
   are not prohibited from VFR training (to include low-level navigation) if unable to secure
   any type of flight following.
   7.1.2. The PIC will conduct planning, at a minimum, IAW paragraph 2.1., as appropriate to
   the area of operations, to ensure VFR operations are authorized and properly planned.
   7.1.3. When conditions (e.g. weather, airspace, etc.) prevent continued flight under VFR, the
   PIC will alter the route and continue operations under VFR until: the destination, obtaining
   an IFR clearance or until landing at a suitable location.
   7.1.4. PICs conducting tactical operations should fly under VFR unless compliance degrades
   mission accomplishment.
   7.1.5. RPA pilots must comply with provisions of JO 7610.4 when operating under VFR.
7.2. Weather Requirements for Filing VFR. The forecast weather for the departure, planned
route of flight and arrival ( 1 hour of the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)) must comply with
the minima in Table 7.1. or 7.2. If transitioning to IFR, the pilot shall maintain appropriate
visibility and cloud clearance requirements to a minimum IFR altitude and until receipt of the
IFR clearance. If transitioning from IFR to VFR, the PIC must maintain the appropriate
visibility and cloud clearances as soon as the IFR cancellation is acknowledged by ATC.
   7.2.1. The forecast for helicopters must comply with Table 7.1. or Table 7.2.
   7.2.2. The forecast for fixed-wing must be equal to or greater than l,500 ft. ceiling and 3
   SMs visibility.
7.3. Flight Operations under VFR. PICs shall adhere to the weather minimums listed in Table
7.1. when in FAA airspace. When outside FAA airspace, PICs shall comply with guidance in
FLIP, FCG or the ICAO VFR weather minimums in Table 7.2. PICs of VFR aircraft must at all
 64                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


times be able to control the aircraft by visual reference to a discernible horizon, regardless of
cloud clearance requirements.
   7.3.1. Cold Weather Operations. USAF pilots shall apply altimeter corrections to en route
   and terrain clearance altitudes, especially when operating VFR at night. See Chapter 8.
7.4. Special VFR (SVFR). USAF fixed-wing aircraft shall not fly under SVFR. MAJCOMs
may allow helicopter aircrews to fly under SVFR IAW 14 CFR §91.157 in FAA airspace, or
appropriate host-nation guidance. Helicopter PIC’s may request SVFR clearances at airports
with the designation ―NO SVFR‖ in the Airport Facilities Directory or on the sectional chart.
7.4. (USAFE)Special VFR (SVFR). USAFE authorized rotary-wing operations under SVFR
IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, and HN guidance as well as MDS-specific AFTTPs.
7.5. VFR Over-the-Top. PICs operating VFR above a ceiling shall comply with AFMAN 11-
217V2. See also paragraph 8.18 for VFR-on-Top.

                                           Chapter 8

                           INSTRUMENT FLIGHT RULES (IFR)

8.1. IFR Requirements. PICs will fly USAF fixed-wing aircraft under IFR to the maximum
extent possible without unacceptable mission degradation. Pilots shall fly under IFR if:
   8.1.1. Weather conditions do not permit flight according to VFR.
   8.1.2. Airspace rules require IFR flight (e.g. Class A airspace).
   8.1.3. Operating in excess of 180 KTAS within (not simply crossing) federal airways.
   8.1.4. Operating fixed-wing aircraft at night, unless the mission cannot be flown under IFR.
      8.1.4.1. (Added-USAFE) HN airspace requirements requiring aircrew to fly VFR
      during night low-level training is considered a mission requirement and is therefore
      included in paragraph 8.1.4.
8.2. Practice Instrument Approaches Under VFR. MAJCOM approval is required to practice
instrument approaches under VFR. The following restrictions apply:
   8.2.1. Maintain VFR cloud clearances and visibilities IAW Chapter 7.
   8.2.2. Terminal radar service shall be used when available.
   8.2.3. Aircrews must make all position reports IAW AFMAN 11-217, Volume 2.
   8.2.4. Pilots must request ATC authorization to fly the published missed approach.
   8.2.5. (Added-USAFE) With OG/CC approval, aircrew are authorized to practice
   instrument approaches under VFR IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, HN, and TO guidance.
8.3. ATC Clearance. Pilots must obtain an ATC clearance before commencing any IFR flight
that originates in or penetrates controlled airspace.
8.4. Published Instrument Procedure. A ―published‖ procedure is defined as:
   8.4.1. An instrument procedure charted in US government FLIP by the DoD/National
   Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) or FAA/National Aeronautical Charting Office
   (NACO). USAF aircrews will use NGA or NACO products when available.
   8.4.2. A procedure developed IAW AFI 11-230, Instrument Procedures.
   8.4.3. Radar procedure with minimums published graphically or in FLIP Radar Instrument
   Approach Minimums section.
   8.4.4. A host nation or commercially produced procedure which is approved by the
   MAJCOM per paragraph 8.4.5.
   8.4.5. Non-US Government and Foreign Terminal Instrument Procedures
   (FTIP). USAF aircrews will not fly a non-US Government (USG) published instrument
   procedure (includes commercially-produced procedures like Jeppesen or Lido) that has not
   been reviewed to ensure conformance with accepted standards by the appropriate Terminal
   Instrument Procedures (TERPS) office. This validation must be a current TERPS review
   letter (attached to the procedure or as published in the ASRR’s ―Giant Report‖) that informs
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                         69


  the pilot of items that do not comply with US TERPS, ICAO PANS-OPS or NATO criteria
  (e.g. recognized obstruction clearance, weather/visibility minima, etc.). MAJCOMs shall
  establish a process to ensure initial (or update) review requests of non-USG or FTIPs are
  provided to the appropriate TERPS office 7 days prior to use.
     8.4.5.1. Prior to use, pilots shall ensure the TERPS review is current. FTIPs
     (government or commercially produced), reviewed by one TERPS office, may be flown
     by aircrews from any other MAJCOM unless precluded by their own MAJCOM.
     8.4.5.1. (USAFE) Restrictions contained in other MAJCOM's review letters apply to all
     USAFE and USAFE-gained aircrews unless a superseding USAFE-specific restriction or
     waiver is annotated.
     8.4.5.2. MAJCOMs must ensure crews receive adequate training prior to the initial use
     of any non-USG instrument procedure. At a minimum, this training should include the
     differences in symbology, language or translation, weather minimums, host nation
     NOTAM retrieval, equipment and airspace requirements.
     8.4.5.2. (USAFE) USAFE aircrew will receive initial non-USG IAP training as part of
     Theater Indoctrination (TI) IAW AFI 11-202V1_USAFESUP_I. Refresher training will
     be incorporated into the local IRC IAW AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program.
     8.4.5.3. Waiver of TERPS Review. During non-standard operations (defined as an
     urgent requirement to fly short-notice: humanitarian, contingency, medical evacuation,
     ―Special‖ Access and vital State Department missions), the TERPS review may be
     waived by the applicable MAJCOM/A3 (if an O-8 or above). The MAJCOM/A3 may
     also waive the TERPS review for non-USG procedures, for which the exact same USG
     procedure exists. If the A3’s grade is below O-8, then waiver authority will lie with the
     first O-8 in the MAJCOM’s operational chain of command. This waiver authority will
     not be further delegated. If this waiver authority is exercised, MAJCOMs will ensure the
     aircrew and the applicable TERPS office are aware that the provisions of paragraph 8.4.5.
     have been waived.
     8.4.5.3. (USAFE) Waiver of TERPS Review. Request TERPS review waivers IAW
     paragraph 1.6.1
     8.4.5.4. (Added-USAFE) IAW AFI 11-230, Instrument Procedures, a non-USG
     instrument procedure must be reviewed by HQ USAFE/APF, have a table-top review
     conducted by HQ USAFE/A3TV, and be approved by HQ USAFE/A3. If a dispatching
     agency does not make requests on behalf of the aircrew, the aircrew will use the
     following procedures when requesting a TERPS review.
         8.4.5.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Aircrew will determine that a review is needed based on
         the following factors (reference the ASRR ―Giant Report‖): 1) no USG approach is
         published for the same procedure, 2) a current review does not already exist or a
         current review will expire during the mission (see paragraph 8.4.5.1).
         8.4.5.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Once aircrew determine a review is needed, they shall
         reference the ―HQ USAFE Air Procedures Flight (APF)‖ page on the AF Portal
         (https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC134C
         680FB5E044080020E329A9) for the most current ―USAFE TERPS Review Request.‖

          An additional link to the APF page can be found on the USAFE/A3TV CoP by clicking
          on the ―TERPS Portal Review Request‖ link.
          8.4.5.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Forward requests IAW the TERPS Review Request
          document email link (usafe.terps@ramstein.af.mil) NLT 7 business days prior to
          the mission start date. Short-notice requests (< 7 business days) will be accepted, but
          must be kept to an absolute minimum to ensure review completion by the mission
          date. If problems occur with the online review request, contact HQ USAFE/APF
          (DSN: 314-480-7024; Comm: +49-6371-47-7024).
          8.4.5.4.4. (Added-USAFE) Approved procedures are not MAJCOM/aircraft
          specific. Aircrew are responsible for conducting a thorough review of each approved
          approach (prior to flight) to determine that the procedure is compatible with the
          navigation equipment installed in their aircraft.
          8.4.5.4.5. (Added-USAFE) It is the responsibility of the requesting aircrew to
          ensure a requested procedure has been reviewed and is posted to the ASRR prior to
          use. For updates on the status of a requested review, aircrew may contact HQ
          USAFE/APF or HQ USAFE/A3TV inside five working days of the mission date.
8.5. Destination Requirements for Filing Purposes. See Attachment 2 for a decision tree.
   8.5.1. Destination with a Published Approach Procedure. Pilots may file IFR to a
   destination with a published instrument approach capable of being flown with navigational
   equipment aboard the aircraft.
   8.5.2. Destination Without a Published Instrument Approach Procedure. If there is no
   compatible published approach at the destination, pilots may file a composite IFR/VFR flight
   plan to:
       8.5.2.1. A point en route where forecast weather at ETA (+ 1 hour) allows continued
       flight to the destination under VFR.
       8.5.2.2. A point served by a published approach procedure where forecast weather at
       ETA (+ 1 hour) allows the pilot to descend to VFR conditions and continue to the
       destination under VFR.
8.6. IFR Filing Weather Requirements. The following are the weather requirements for filing
to a destination:
   8.6.1. Temporary (TEMPO) Conditions. Pilots may file to a destination with a forecast
   that includes temporary (TEMPO) changes in ceiling and/or visibility lower than prescribed
   in 8.7.1., but an alternate may be required.
   8.6.1. (USAFE) Temporary (TEMPO) Conditions. See paragraph 8.6.3.1.1 for filing to
   a destination with TEMPO conditions below the minimum filing weather.
   8.6.2. UAS Weather Requirements. MAJCOMs may determine UAS weather limit
   requirements based on airspace rules, aircraft equipage, level of autonomy and crew
   qualifications/capabilities. In the absence MAJCOM guidance, UAS will follow weather
   requirements as published in this section.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                             71


   8.6.3. Fixed-Wing Aircraft. Weather for the ETA (±1 hour) at destination or recovery base
   must be at or above the lowest compatible published landing minimums for the aircraft
   concerned.
      8.6.3.1. MAJCOMs may waive this requirement when operational necessity dictates the
      use of a destination forecast to be below minimums, but MAJCOMs must establish
      alternate recovery procedures, such as the use of two or more alternate airports,
      additional holding fuel, etc.
      8.6.3.1. (USAFE) With OG/CC approval, aircrew may file to a destination whose
      forecast (not including TEMPO conditions) is lower than prescribed in 8.6.3, but will
      designate two alternates by using the dual alternate concept described in paragraph 8.8.3
      (Added).
          8.6.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Aircrew may file to a destination whose forecast
          includes TEMPO changes in ceiling and/or visibility that are lower than prescribed in
          8.6.3 and 8.6.4, but an alternate may be required (see paragraph 8.7)
      8.6.3.2. For a straight-in or sidestep approach, the forecast weather must meet only the
      published visibility requirements for that approach.
      8.6.3.2. (USAFE) CAF Only (not to include rotary-wing). Both the forecast ceiling
      and visibility will be at or above their applicable PWC minimums [see Table A4.1
      (Added)].
      8.6.3.3. For a circling approach, the forecast weather must meet both the ceiling and
      prevailing visibility requirements.
   8.6.4. Helicopters. PICs may use Category A minima, regardless of approach speed. PICs
   should fly a constant airspeed to comply with the stabilized approach concept. PICs may reduce
   the Category A visibility minima on Category I procedures by one-half, but no lower than 1/4
   SM prevailing visibility (PV) or 1,200 feet runway visual range (RVR). PICs may not reduce the
   visibility minima on Copter procedures, Category II procedures or if ―Visibility Reduction by
   Helicopters NA‖ is annotated on the procedure. PICs will apply any inoperative approach
   lighting visibility correction before reducing minima. PICs will apply airspeed limitations IAW

8.7. Required IFR Alternate. This section prescribes when an IFR alternate must be filed.
MAJCOMs will determine alternate airfield policies for UAS.
   8.7.1. Weather. An alternate is required when the worst weather (TEMPO or prevailing) at
   the ETA (±1 hour) for the first point of intended landing (or each point of intended landing
   on a stopover flight plan) does not permit a VFR descent from the MIA and is less than:
   8.7.1. (USAFE) Weather. To determine MIA, aircrew will use the highest Minimum
   Sector Altitude (MSA) as published on either USG or TERPs-reviewed non-USG IAPs
   (NOTE: aircrew will ensure they reference the TERPs review letter for any MSA
   adjustments prior to referencing the non-USG IAP). An IAP may be used to determine the
   MSA regardless of the compatibility of the aircraft. If an MSA is not published (or an IAP is
   not available), aircrew will use the highest ORTCA (found on the OCONUS Low Enroute
   Chart) within 10NMs of the field. Reference paragraph 8.13 and Attachment 1, Glossary
   of References and Supporting Information for more information on MIA determinations.
      8.7.1.1. Fixed-Wing Aircraft: A ceiling of 2,000 ft. and a visibility of 3 SMs.
          8.7.1.1.1. Exception: MAJCOMs may lower this requirement to a ceiling of 1,000 ft.
          and a visibility of 2 SMs, if two or more suitable independent precision approaches
          are available and operable for the airport of intended landing at ETA (±1 hour).
          8.7.1.1.1. (USAFE) Exception: USAFE authorizes a ceiling of 1,000 ft and a
          visibility of 2 SMs at those airfields where there are two or more runways each
          supported by their own suitable and fully-serviceable precision approach.
      8.7.1.2. Helicopters. A ceiling of 1,000 ft. (or 400 ft. above the lowest compatible
      approach minimums, whichever is higher) and a visibility of 2 SM.
   8.7.2. Additional Conditions Requiring an Alternate. Unless forecast weather for the
   ETA (±1 hour) at the destination (or a point en route) exceeds the requirements of 8.7.1. and
   permits a VFR descent from the Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA) to a VFR approach and
   landing, pilots must designate an alternate airport on all IFR flight plans when filing to a
   destination:
      8.7.2.1. Where all compatible approaches require radar.
      8.7.2.2. Where required NAVAIDs are unmonitored.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                              73


       8.7.2.3. When the destination has no weather reporting capability.
       8.7.2.4. When the point of intended landing’s lowest compatible approach weather
       minimums are greater than or equal to a 1,500 ft. ceiling or 3 SM visibility.
       8.7.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Aircrew will designate en route alternates for use in the event
       of unsuccessful AR operations on all flights where AR is required to successfully
       complete the mission.
   8.7.3. Exception for Remote or Island Destinations. MAJCOMs may authorize holding
   for a specified time in lieu of an alternate for those remote or island destinations for which
   designating an alternate is not possible. MAJCOMs that authorize holding at a remote or
   island destination will prescribe weather criteria and recovery procedures.
   8.7.3. (USAFE) Exception for Remote or Island Destinations. USAFE authorizes
   holding in-lieu of an alternate for remote or island destinations IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3
   guidance.
   8.7.4. (Added-USAFE) Keflavik Alternate Weather Requirements. Reference the
   AFFSA waiver titled ―Waiver for Keflavik Flying Operations‖ for all USAFE F-15(C-E)/F-
   16 flying operations conducted at Keflavik, Iceland for determining alternate and fuel
   requirements (when an alternate is normaly required IAW AFI 11-202V3 guidance).
   Reference the ―Waivers‖ folder on the USAFE/A3TV ICE for the most current version of the
   waiver document.
8.8. Selecting an Alternate. Except for TEMPO conditions for thunderstorms and snow/rain
showers, the worst forecasted prevailing weather conditions for an alternate airport (ETA ±1
hour) must meet or exceed:
   8.8.1. Alternate with a Compatible Published Instrument Approach Procedure:
   8.8.1. (USAFE) Alternate with a Compatible Published Instrument Approach
   Procedure: CAF Only (not including rotary wing). PWC minimums will not be used to
   determine if the weather is suitable to declare an airfield as an alternate. PWCs should be
   factored into ORM assessments when alternate weather is at/near PWC minimums.
       8.8.1.1. Fixed-Wing Aircraft. A ceiling of at least 500 ft. above the lowest compatible
       approach minima and a visibility of at least 2 SM or published visibility minima
       whichever is greater.
       8.8.1.2. Helicopters. A ceiling of at least 200 ft. above, and a visibility of at least 1 SM
       above, the lowest compatible published landing minimum.
   8.8.2. Alternate without a Published or Compatible Instrument Approach
   Procedure. Forecast weather for the ETA (±1 hour) must permit a VFR descent from the
   MIA to a VFR approach and landing, or, if the mission justifies the increased risk, under
   specific conditions, an otherwise unqualified airfield may be designated as an alternate by the
   MAJCOM/A3. MAJCOMs establish UAS alternate airfield policies.
   8.8.2. (USAFE) Alternate without a Published or Compatible Instrument Approach
   Procedure. To determine MIA at alternate airfields, aircrew will use the highest Minimum
   Sector Altitude (MSA) as published on either USG or TERPs-reviewed non-USG IAPs
   (NOTE: aircrew will ensure they reference the TERPs review letter for any MSA
 74                    AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


   adjustments prior to referencing the non-USG IAP). An IAP may be used to determine the
   MSA regardless of the compatibility of the aircraft. If an MSA is not published (or an IAP is
   not available), aircrew will use the highest ORTCA (found on the OCONUS Low Enroute
   Chart) within 10NMs of the field. Reference paragraph 8.13 and Attachment 1 Glossary
   of References and Supporting Information for more information on MIA determinations.
   8.8.3. (Added-USAFE) Dual Alternates. IAW with the AFFSA document title ―Waiver
   for Alternate Requirements‖, when unable to select an airport that meets the alternate
   weather requirements of paragraphs 8.8.1 and 8.8.2, aircrew may use dual alternates IAW
   the following guidance. Reference the ―Waivers‖ folder on the USAFE/A3TV ICE for the
   most current version of the waiver document.
      8.8.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Each alternate must have a compatible and operational
      precision approach servicing the active runway.
      8.8.3.2. (Added-USAFE) The worst weather (prevailing or TEMPO) forecasted for
      both alternates during the period 1 hour before to 1 hour after the ETA is no less than:
          8.8.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) 700 ft ceiling or 400 ft above the published minimums,
          whichever is higher.
          8.8.3.2.2. (Added-USAFE) 1.6KM visibility day (2.4KM night), or the published
          visibility minimum, whichever is higher.
      8.8.3.3. (Added-USAFE) The alternates are at least 35NM apart. The more distant
      alternate will be used to compute fuel requirements.
8.9. Airports That Do Not Qualify as Alternates. Except IAW paragraph 8.8.2, airports do
not qualify as alternates if:
   8.9.1. All compatible approaches require radar.
   8.9.1. (USAFE) If the forecast weather for the ETA (±1 hour) at an alternate does not
   permit a VFR descent from the MIA (see paragraph 8.8.2 (USAFE)) to a VFR approach
   and landing, then IAW the MAJCOM/A3 authorization allowed in paragraph 8.8.2 airfields
   within the USAFE AOR where all compatible approaches require radar may still be
   designated as alternates IAW the following guidance.
      8.9.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Squadron operations supervision determines the increased
      risk is acceptable due to complete dependence on HN radar capabilities based on mission
      requirements, aircrew experience, and HN equipment reliability.
      8.9.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Aircrew must ensure familiarity with applicable lost
      communication procedures for the approaches being flown to include any specific HN
      requirements.
      8.9.1.3. (Added-USAFE) To the maximum extent practical, at non-US-controlled
      fields, a Supervisor of Flying (SOF) or similar MDS liaison will be available (with access
      to the necessary radios) to communicate with USAF aircrew and liaise with HN ATC
      personnel anytime USAF aircraft are airborne.
   8.9.2. GPS is the only available NAVAID.
   8.9.3. The FLIP designation ―   A   NA‖ is displayed on all compatible approach plates.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                              75


   8.9.4. The FLIP A designation (without NA) is displayed on all compatible approach plates
   and an associated note applies. The A signifies that non-standard alternate minimums are
   published for that runway. While non-standard alternate minimums do not apply to USAF
   aircraft, there may be notes associated with the non-standard alternate minimums that do.
   Pilots must check for such notes whenever the A designation is shown on an IAP.
8.10. RVR Use, Applicability and Conversion. RVR reports, when given for a particular
runway, apply to all takeoffs, landings, and approaches to that runway, and always take
precedence over any other visibility report for that runway. RVR is normally reported in feet or
meters. Pilots will use the static RVR when available (regardless of reported variability). If only
a variable report is received and a static RVR cannot be determined, pilots will apply the lowest
reported RVR value. If necessary, pilots may convert the reported visibility from one format to
another (e.g. RVR to PV) only for takeoffs and straight-in approaches using the conversion
tables printed in the front of the Terminal Procedures Publication (TPP) booklet. For
conversions, use the higher of: the next higher value in the conversion chart, or the highest
published value from the IAP minima block; do not interpolate.
8.10. (USAFE)RVR Use, Applicability and Conversion. ―TPPs‖ are FAA NACO (therefore
CONUS/Alaska/Hawaii) products; however, HQ AFFSA intends for the term ―TPP‖ to include
all USG and TERPS-reviewed non-USG FLIP. If operating in areas of FAA NACO TPP
coverage,    aircrew     can     find  the    current    TPPs    at the following    link:
http://avn.faa.gov/index.asp?xml=aeronav/applications/d_tpp. Select the most current TPP
volume then select the link for ―Legends and General Information‖.
   8.10.1. (Added-USAFE) Alternatively, and for areas without FAA NACO TPP coverage,
   aircrew may use the conversion tables in DoD FLIP, Jeppesen IAP booklets, or HN AIP
   guidance. In all cases, do not interpolate values. Use the higher of either the next higher
   value in the conversion chart or the highest published value from the IAP minima block.
8.11. Minimum Takeoff Weather. Pilots shall not takeoff when existing weather is below the
landing minimums for their aircraft, unless specifically authorized by the MAJCOM, but in no
case less than 600 RVR (200 meters).
8.11. (USAFE)Minimum Takeoff Weather. CAF (except rotary wing). PWC shall be used
to determine landing minimums for takeoff weather.
   8.11.1. RVR Requirements. (N/A for Helicopter) Minima below 1600 RVR are not
   authorized unless the runways are equipped with centerline lights, visible runway centerline
   markings, and two operative transmissometers. All reported RVR readings must meet or
   exceed minimum authorized values.
   8.11.2. MAJCOMs that permit takeoffs when weather is lower than the published landing
   minimums shall prescribe alternative takeoff minima and substitute recovery procedures.
       8.11.2.1. (Added-USAFE) CAF (except rotary wing). The OG/CC may authorize
       aircrew to take off in weather below their PWC (but not lower than approach minimums)
       when operational requirements dictate.
       8.11.2.2. (Added-USAFE) MAF. USAFE authorizes takeoffs with weather below
       landing minimums IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3 guidance.
 76                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


   8.11.3. Civil contract carriers may operate from airports under USAF jurisdiction using the
   takeoff minimums approved by the FAA and published in the air carrier's operations
   specifications.
8.12. IFR Departures. Pilots of USAF aircraft must adhere to IFR departure procedures
guidance in this section and in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.
   8.12.1. MAJCOM Responsibility. Normally, MAJCOMs or COMAFFORs will ensure
   aircraft are tasked to takeoff at a weight that allows the PIC to comply with paragraph
   8.12.11.
   8.12.2. PIC Responsibility. The PIC will ensure the planned departure method, climb
   gradient, low close-in obstacles, route and emergency procedures are briefed to the crew
   prior to takeoff. See Attachment 3 for a decision tree.
   8.12.3. Authorized IFR Departure Methods. Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP) and
   Standard Instrument Departures (SID) should be flown to the maximum extent possible.
   USAF aircraft will depart IFR using only these methods:
      8.12.3.1. Published ODP; textual or graphic, including Reduced Takeoff Runway Length
      (RTRL) and Visual Climb Over the Airport (VCOA) procedures. VCOA procedures may
      also be termed VCID (Visual Climb to Instrument Departure).
      8.12.3.2. SID.
      8.12.3.3. Specific ATC Departure Instructions.
      8.12.3.4. Diverse Departures (Omni-directional Departures-ICAO).
      8.12.3.5. Special MAJCOM Certification (authorized locations, pilots and aircraft only).
      See paragraph 8.12.9.
   8.12.4. Obstacle Departure Procedures. Pilots will fly the published ODP               for the
   runway used. If issued other departure instructions, pilots should request clearance to fly the
   ODP or comply with 8.12.6.
      8.12.4.1. Visual Climb Over Airport. Pilots will not fly any VCOA procedure until
      completion of MAJCOM-specified training. The weather must be at or above the
      minimums published for the VCOA. Unless published, pilots will consider the VCOA’s
      visibility requirement as a ―remain within‖ distance, and will not exceed this radius from
      the center of the airfield while climbing to the specified altitude. Pilots will notify ATC
      (or other traffic) when planning to depart via the VCOA. Pilots without NVDs will not
      fly a VCOA at night, unless specifically authorized by the MAJCOM.
      8.12.4.1. (USAFE) Visual Climb Over Airport. VCOA Training. Aircrew will
      accomplish and document VCOA training IAW AFI 11-2MDSV1 and V3. If no guidance exists
      accomplish VCOA training IAW the following guidance. If not received as part of local Theater
      Indoctrination (TI) training (see AFI 11-202V1_USAFESUP_I) pilots will review the USAFE
      VCOA training presentation found on the USAFE/A3TV ICE under ―Misc Information and
      Guidance‖ (link: https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/A3/A3T/A3TV_External/default.aspx) prior to
      their first flight using VCOA procedures. Units will document the training with the ARMS event
      VC10.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                             77


         8.12.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) VCOA Procedures at Night. USAFE authorizes
         VCOA procedures at night without NVDs IAW the following guidance:
             8.12.4.1.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Flying the VCOA procedure must be a last resort
             for the aircraft to safely depart the airfield.
             8.12.4.1.1.2. (Added-USAFE) A suitable terrain chart (scale no greater than
             1:500,000) is thoroughly reviewed during mission planning/briefing and readily
             accessible in-flight).
             8.12.4.1.1.3. (Added-USAFE) The aircrew has adequately (as determined by
             operations supervision) identified and, to the max extent practical, mitigated the
             risks involved (updated ORM, heightened awareness, CRM, etc.).
     8.12.4.2. Reduced Takeoff Runway Length ODP. Pilots using a published RTRL
     procedure shall ensure their aircraft can attain a safe liftoff speed and rotate prior to the
     distance remaining specified in the procedure. MAJCOMS should establish ad hoc
     RTRL request procedures for their aircrews. Ad hoc RTRL procedures will be
     considered a published ODP.
     8.12.4.2. (USAFE) Reduced Takeoff Runway Length ODP. Aircrew will request ad
     hoc RTRL ODPs IAW TERPS review request procedures (see paragraph 8.4.5.3).
     8.12.4.3. Sector Departure ODP. Pilots may fly ―sector‖ diverse departures as
     published.
  8.12.5. Standard Instrument Departures. PICs will comply with the routing, altitudes,
  and climb gradient (including notes) published on the SID (or in the , if not published on
  the SID). If the aircraft cannot comply with an ATC minimum climb gradient, coordinate
  with ATC prior to flying the procedure or obtain an amended clearance. The term SID
  includes other approved published instrument departure procedures (DP).
  8.12.6. Specific ATC Departure Instructions. ATC instructions refer to specific
  navigational guidance (e.g. heading, routing, altitude) issued with the clearance or by tower.
  Outside the NAS, in a non-radar environment, to be considered a valid instrument departure,
  the instructions must be issued with either a minimum climb gradient or confirmation that the
  climb gradient does not exceed 200 feet/NM. Unless issued with a minimum climb gradient,
  the instructions may not provide obstacle clearance below a minimum IFR altitude.
  Therefore, in all cases:
     8.12.6.1. If the departure runway has any published climb gradients, the PIC must meet
     or exceed the highest gradient when departing via ATC instructions.
     8.12.6.2. If unable to meet any ATC climb gradient, coordinate with ATC prior to flying
     the procedure.
     8.12.6.3. Pilots are never relieved of the responsibility for terrain and obstacle avoidance.
     The radio call ―Radar Contact‖ only means the aircraft has been identified on radar.
     Responsibility is shared between pilot and controller only after navigational guidance is
     issued.
     8.12.6.4. Outside the NAS, use caution when flying radar vectors. See paragraph 8.13.2.

  8.12.7. Diverse Departures (Omni-directional Departure). Pilots will track runway
  centerline to 400 feet above the DER before turning on course. PICs must ensure their
  aircraft will vertically clear applicable low close-in obstacles published in NOTAMs or the
  Takeoff Minima and Departure Procedures (              ) before turning on course. Diverse
  departures are not authorized when an obstacle departure procedure, climb gradient or non-
  standard takeoff weather minima are published for that runway. ―Sector‖ diverse departures
  are authorized.
  8.12.8. Special MAJCOM Certification. MAJCOMs may develop departure procedures
  for their aircraft at specific locations that allow safe aircraft departure. Pilots must meet
  MAJCOM-specified training or certification requirements before these procedures may be
  flown. Once developed, these departure procedures will be sent to HQ AFFSA/A3O for
  review and inclusion in the ASRR or other appropriate location.
  8.12.9. No Authorized IFR Departure Method. If the airport does not have one of the IFR
  departure methods described above, then an IFR departure is not authorized. Refer to
  Chapter 7.
  8.12.10. Required Climb Gradients. Regardless of the IFR departure method selected,
  PICs will climb at a minimum of 200 ft/NM unless a higher gradient is published for the
  departure runway (in a departure procedure or ). For specific ATC departure instruction
  climb gradients, see paragraph 8.12.6. When no departure procedure is published and a
  diverse departure is not authorized, coordination with MAJCOM TERPS specialists is
  required to determine the best departure method and required climb gradient prior to an IFR
  departure.
  8.12.10. (USAFE) Required Climb Gradients. Reference paragraph 8.4.5.3 for TERPS
  review correspondence and requests.
     8.12.10.1. Low Close-in Obstacles. In addition to complying with the published climb
     gradient, the PIC must also ensure that the aircraft can always vertically clear applicable
     published low close-in obstacles.
     8.12.10.1. (USAFE) Low Close-in Obstacles. Reference Attachment 1 for a
     definition of ―Low Close-in Obstacles‖.
     8.12.10.2. Non-Standard Takeoff Minimums. Pilots will not depart an airfield using
     non-standard takeoff minimums in lieu of meeting the required climb gradient. When
     non-standard takeoff minima are published, with or without a climb gradient, the PIC
     may not take-off under the provisions of IFR established in paragraph 8.11. unless:
         8.12.10.2.1. The departure procedure authorizes ―standard‖ takeoff minimums with a
         climb gradient in lieu of the non-standard criteria and the requirements of paragraph
         8.12.10.4 or 8.12.10.5 below are met, or
         8.12.10.2.2. The aircraft is capable of being at or above the published non-standard
         takeoff minima ceiling requirement prior to crossing the departure end of the runway
         (for fixed-wing multi-engine, calculate this capability with One Engine Inoperative
         (OEI)) and can continue a climb profile that will vertically clear all obstacles.
     8.12.10.3. Unable to meet Required Climb Gradient. If unable to meet or exceed the
     required climb gradient and before reducing a published gradient with one of the methods
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                           79


     listed below, MAJCOMs will ensure supervisors and PICs consider: reducing aircraft
     gross weight, delaying the mission until environmental conditions improve, the crew’s
     familiarity with the departure area and the ability to increase performance by jettisoning
     external stores. If still unable to comply with the required gradient after exhausting the
     remedies in this chapter, an IFR departure is not authorized. Exception: If the mission
     justifies the increased risk, and if specifically authorized by the MAJCOM/A3, the pilot
     may depart any location, in VMC, without regard to the IFR climb gradient. Without
     such specific authorization, pilots will refer to Chapter 7.
     8.12.10.3. (USAFE) Unable to meet Required Climb Gradient. For the following
     missions, USAFE authorizes the OG/CC (CAF aircraft) or the owning AOC/CC or
     comparable level of flying supervision if agreed upon between the owning AOC and the unit
     (MAF aircraft) to approve IFR departures in VMC if aircrew are unable to comply with
     paragraph 8.12.10.3. Prior to departure, aircrew will ensure all factor obstacles and
     associated avoidance plans are briefed and understood. Approval authority for all other
     missions is USAFE/A3 (make requests IAW paragraph 1.6.1.4. [written] or 1.6.1.5. [verbal]).
        8.12.10.3.1. (Added-USAFE) HHQ-tasked/Contingency
        8.12.10.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Urgent Aeromedical Evac
     8.12.10.4. Single Engine Aircraft and All Helicopters. PIC’s will ensure the aircraft
     meets or exceeds the published climb gradient (or 200 ft/NM if a higher gradient is not
     published) for the selected departure to an appropriate minimum IFR altitude IAW
     paragraph 8.13.
        8.12.10.4.1. If unable to comply and when authorized by the MAJCOM, climb in
        VMC to an appropriate IFR altitude or fly VFR IAW Chapter 7.
        8.12.10.4.1. (USAFE) With OG/CC approval, USAFE authorizes IFR departures in
        VMC if unable to comply with paragraph 8.12.10.4.
     8.12.10.5. Multi-Engine Fixed Wing Aircraft. PIC’s will ensure the aircraft meets or
     exceeds the published climb gradient (or 200 ft/NM if a higher gradient is not published)
     for the selected IFR departure method, with One Engine Inoperative (OEI), to an
     appropriate MIA.
        8.12.10.5.1. If operationally necessary, the operations supervisor (or equivalent
        mission execution authority supervisor) may authorize the PIC to ensure the aircraft
        vertically clears all obstacles along the planned departure path OEI by subtracting up
        to 48’/NM from the published (or standard) climb gradient or the use of the departure
        runway’s SDP for OEI departure planning (IAW 8.12.11.).
        8.12.10.5.1. (USAFE) For USAFE CAF aircraft ―Operations supervisor,‖ in this
        context, is IAW AFI 11-418. For USAFE MAF aircraft approval authority is the
        SQ/CC or designated representative. The following missions are considered
        ―operationally necessary‖:
            8.12.10.5.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Training conducted as part of any Building
            Partnership (BP) deployment/mission.
            8.12.10.5.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Upgrade training conducted under an approved
            syllabus.
 80                    AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


              8.12.10.5.1.3. (Added-USAFE) HHQ-tasked/Contingency missions
              8.12.10.5.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Urgent Aeromedical Evac
          8.12.10.5.2. When using any method to reduce the required climb gradient, the PIC
          must still ensure the aircraft, with all engines operating (AEO), meets or exceeds the
          published climb gradient and all ATC or SID climb restrictions for the method
          selected.
   8.12.11. Special Departure Procedures (SDP). MAJCOMs may authorize SDPs for OEI
   departure planning when operationally necessary. The following guidance applies to the use
   of SDP’s or similar specifically designed departure procedures and/or routing for use in the
   event of the loss of an engine’s thrust. The term SDP refers to all such procedures/routing
   and not to any one particular product. All such products must be constructed from data and
   criteria specifically approved by HQ AFFSA/A3O. MAJCOMs must certify pilots prior to
   the use of SDPs. PICs must understand a SDP delivers as little as zero feet of obstruction
   clearance and must be flown exactly as published. PIC’s shall:
   8.12.11. (USAFE) 4 (Added) USAFE authorizes SDP use IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3 for the
   ―operationally necessary‖ missions listed in paragraphs 8.12.10.5.1.1 (Added) -
   8.12.10.5.1.3 (Added).
      8.12.11.1. Use only the most current procedure and brief the procedure prior to takeoff,
      8.12.11.2. Not exceed the maximum gross weight published for the procedure,
      8.12.11.3. Fly SDP routing that differs from clearance routing only in an emergency,
      unless approved by ATC.
      8.12.11.4. (Added-USAFE) USAFE certification is satisfied by successful completion
      of a unit training program IAW AFI 11-2MDSV1 and local guidance. In addition to AFI
      11-2MDSV1 documentation, units that use SDPs will annotate SDP certification on the
      squadron Letter of Xs (see AFI 11-202V2_USAFESUP_I, Attachment 11).
8.13. Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA). This section is not applicable to climbs and descents
required for takeoff and landing or practice approaches.
   8.13.1. On Airways. Pilots shall not fly lower than the Minimum En route Altitude (MEA),
   Minimum Reception Altitude (MRA), Minimum Crossing Altitude (MCA) or Minimum
   Obstacle Clearance Altitude (MOCA) published for the airway.
      8.13.1.1. Pilots using the MOCA shall ensure that the altitude selected will provide
      suitable navigation facility and ATC radio reception.
   8.13.2. Off Airways. Pilots shall fly no lower than:
      8.13.2.1. The Off Route Obstacle Clearance Altitude (OROCA).
      8.13.2.2. The Off Route Terrain Clearance Altitude (ORTCA).
          8.13.2.2.1. Pilots using the OROCA or ORTCA shall ensure that the altitude selected
          will provide suitable navigation facility and ATC radio communication reception.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                          81


     8.13.2.3. An altitude that provides at least 1,000 ft. of clearance above all obstacles
     within 5 nautical miles of the course to be flown in non-mountainous terrain or 2,000 ft.
     in mountainous terrain (see paragraph 2.11. & Glossary).
     8.13.2.3. (USAFE) The calculation in paragraph 8.13.2.3 will be used to determine
     Route Abort Altitude (RAA) for all low-level training in the USAFE AOR. Aircrew will
     ensure the RAA encompasses the entire area anticipated for low-level training regardless
     of black line routing. Reference AFI 11-2MDSV3 for more information.
     8.13.2.4. Descent below applicable MIAs, listed above, is only authorized under the
     following conditions:
        8.13.2.4.1. To an ATC-provided Minimum radar Vectoring Altitude (MVA) within
        the NAS from a suitably equipped and capable radar facility. For areas of
        responsibility outside the NAS, MAJCOMs will determine which radar facilities are
        not suitably equipped and capable.
        8.13.2.4.1. (USAFE) Aircrew may accept an IFR clearance in IMC at MVA IAW
        HN and local procedures given that ATC assumes obstacle/terrain/traffic clearance
        responsibility. Note: It is incumbent upon aircrew to be familiar with the MIA at their
        destination airfield should they need to execute IAW paragraph 8.13.2.4.1.1 As a
        technique to determine MIA, aircrew may use the highest Minimum Sector Altitude
        (MSA) as published on either USG or TERPs-reviewed non-USG IAPs (Note:
        aircrew will ensure they reference the TERPs review letter for any MSA adjustments
        prior to referencing the non-USG IAP). An IAP may be used to determine the MSA
        regardless of the compatibility of the aircraft. If an MSA is not published (or an IAP
        is not available), aircrew will use the highest ORTCA (found on the OCONUS Low
        Enroute Chart) within 10NMs of the field.
            8.13.2.4.1.1. If there is any doubt as to whether the ATC-provided minimum
            vectoring altitude is providing adequate obstacle clearance pilots should not
            descend below the non-radar minimum altitudes listed above.
            8.13.2.4.1.1. (USAFE) Prior to low-level training within the USAFE AOR, units
            will ensure aircrew are trained and familiar with local and HN allowances for
            IMC descents into the low-level environment. IMC descents to the low level
            environment are prohibited under ATC control if ATC cannot provide
            obstacle/terrain/traffic separation. Only those aircraft equipped with a Terrain
            Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA) system are authorized IMC descents to the
            low-level environment, but only if receiving IFR traffic separation from ATC and
            executed IAW HN rules and agreements and (see paragraph 8.13.2.4.3)
            8.13.2.4.1.2. In no case will the minimum altitude be below 1000 ft. AGL.
        8.13.2.4.2. When cloud clearance and visibility, IAW Tables 7.1/7.2 or MAJCOM
        direction, allow the pilot to maintain safe clearance from terrain and obstacles, or
        8.13.2.4.3. When a MAJCOM-approved self-contained navigation system (or
        approved Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance system (TF/TA)) is used.
        8.13.2.4.3. (USAFE) USAFE approves use of all TF/TA systems certified for use on
        USAFE aircraft IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3 and TO guidance. Aircrew will use the
 82                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


          systems only IAW AFI 11-214, AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, and TO guidance as well as
          MDS-specific AFTTPs.
   8.13.3. Military Training Routes (MTR). Pilots operating on MTRs shall adhere to the
   minimum altitudes published in FLIP AP.
   8.13.3. (USAFE) Military Training Routes (MTR). In the USAFE AOR where low-level
   training areas are used by HN instead of MTRs, reference HN low-level guidance for
   minimum altitude information.
8.14. IFR Cruising Altitudes.
   8.14.1. Pilots should file requested altitudes for IFR flights in controlled airspace according
   to the cruising altitude diagram depicted on the appropriate en route chart.
   8.14.2. Pilots operating in uncontrolled airspace shall maintain altitude IAW the diagrams
   published on the appropriate en route chart.
8.15. IFR Enroute Navigation. Pilots shall fly along the centerline of the direct course
between NAVAIDS or fixes defining a published or unpublished route when operating in
controlled airspace under IFR unless:
   8.15.1. Authorized by the controlling agency, or while operating in SUA or on MTRs.
   8.15.1. (USAFE) In the UK aircrew may assume clearance to fly other than direct course
   anytime aircraft are under ―Traffic Service‖ or ―Deconfliction Service‖ (execute IAW UK
   AIP). ―SUA‖ also includes all HN-defined low level operating airspace/routes as defined in
   HN AIPs.
8.16. In-Flight Communications.
   8.16.1. Position Reports. A pilot operating under IFR will continuously monitor
   appropriate ATC frequencies and follow FIH instructions for position reports, lost
   communications, and radio procedures.
   8.16.1. (USAFE) Position Reports. Fighter aircrew are not responsible for position
   reporting when in-formation with a tanker (e.g. CORONET movements). Should
   circumstances dictate separation from the tanker, aircrew will attempt to remain in radio
   contact with a tanker who will relay position reports as required.
   8.16.2. Navigation and Communication Equipment Malfunctions. When operating in
   controlled airspace under IFR, the PIC will immediately report to ATC the loss or
   impairment of navigational or air-to-ground communications capability according to
   instructions in the FIH.
   8.16.2. (USAFE) Navigation and Communication Equipment Malfunctions. In the UK,
   paragraph 8.16.2 applies anytime when under ―Radar Control‖. While under ―Traffic
   Service‖ or ―Deconfliction Service‖ aircrew will report comm/nav problems (not including
   complete loss of comm--in which case follow FIH procedures) only if it directly impairs their
   ability to maintain an IFR service in IMC.
   8.16.3. Cancellation of IFR Clearance. Pilots shall ensure compliance with Chapter 7 of
   this instruction before canceling IFR. VFR flight following requirements are not required if
   already in contact with the destination’s control tower.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                              83


   8.16.3. (USAFE) Cancellation of IFR Clearance. See paragraph 7.1.1 (USAFE).
8.17. Descent, Approach and Landing. Pilots will obtain the latest destination airport
conditions prior to beginning descent or commencing an approach. See paragraph 8.10.
   8.17.1. Prior to Descent or Approach. Pilots shall not begin an en route descent, arrival or
   published approach if the destination’s weather is below the required approach minimums.
   8.17.1. (USAFE) Prior to Descent or Approach. This does not prohibit aircrew from
   proceeding to a published holding fix on a segment of the published arrival/approach (see
   paragraph 8.7.3 for remote or island destinations). In all cases, aircrew will not delay the
   decision to divert once the aircraft has already reached the pre-planned fuel state needed to
   proceed to a designated alternate.
      8.17.1.1. After Beginning Descent or Approach. If a pilot has begun the en route
      descent, arrival or published approach (or has received a radar vector for the approach)
      and subsequently determines the weather is below minimums (visibility for straight-in
      approaches or either ceiling or visibility for circling approaches), the pilot must not
      deviate from the last ATC clearance until obtaining a new or amended clearance. The
      pilot may request a clearance to a holding fix or alternate airport, or, unless restricted by
      the MAJCOM, continue the approach as published to the Missed Approach Point (MAP)
      and land if the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing and the runway environment
      is in sight (See AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1).
   8.17.2. Determining Visibility Minimums for Approach and Landing. Prevailing
   visibility (PV) may be used when RVR is not reported. For circling approaches, PV shall be
   used. See paragraph 8.10. MAJCOMs shall determine suitable weather minima based on
   aircraft equipage, level of autonomy and crew proficiency.
   8.17.2. (USAFE) Determining         Visibility  Minimums        for  Approach      and
   Landing. Weather minima will be IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3 determination of aircraft
   category. When RVR is not reported, PV will be used based on the highest of ATIS, ATC-
   provided weather, or TO-certified on-board WX reporting system.
      8.17.2.1. Operational Criteria for Arriving Aircraft. USAF pilots will not use
      published visibility minima below 2,400 feet (or ½ SM or 800m) unless touchdown zone
      (TDZ) and centerline lighting (CL) are available and operable. Helicopter PICs will use
      touchdown zone RVR to determine visibility requirements.
          8.17.2.1.1. Category I (1800 RVR or greater). MAJCOMs may authorize Category I
          Instrument Landing System (ILS) approaches to less than 2400 RVR at locations
          without TDZ/CL (or when such system is inoperative) provided the approach is flown
          using guidance from an approved flight director, heads-up display, or coupled to an
          autopilot flown to a Decision Altitude. In addition to MAJCOM approval,
          authorization must be stated on the IAP.
          8.17.2.1.1. (USAFE) Category I (1800 RVR or greater). USAFE authorizes Cat I
          approaches IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, and HN guidance.
          8.17.2.1.2. Category II (1200 to less than 1800 RVR). Touchdown zone RVR will
          be used to determine if visibility is suitable for the instrument approach procedure.
          For RVR 1600 to less than 1800, mid/rollout RVR values will be used as advisory
84                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


         information. If RVR is less than 1600, rollout RVR (or mid RVR, if rollout RVR
         inoperative) is also required.
         8.17.2.1.3. Category III (RVR less than 1200). All installed transmissometers must
         be operational. MAJCOMs will publish Category III RVR requirements (i.e. in 11-
         2MDS V3), if applicable.
         8.17.2.1.3. (USAFE) Category III (RVR less than 1200). (USAFE) Reference AFI
         11-2MDSV3 for Cat III RVR requirements.
     8.17.2.2. Straight-In or Sidestep Approach. Weather must only be at or above the
     published visibility minimums.
     8.17.2.2. (USAFE) Straight-In or Sidestep Approach. CAF (except rotary wing).
     Weather must be at or above both the published ceiling and visibility minimums.
     8.17.2.3. Circling Approach. Weather must be at or above both the published ceiling
     and visibility minimums.
     8.17.2.4. Inoperative Approach Lighting System (ALS). Unless paragraph 5.12.1.4.
     applies, when the runway ALS (or any portion thereof), as depicted on the procedure, is
     inoperative, pilots shall increase the published visibility minimums of an instrument
     approach by one of the following:
         8.17.2.4.1. As directed by the inoperative components table in FLIP.
         8.17.2.4.2. As stated on IAP, NOTAMs, ATIS, or other airport information source.
         8.17.2.4.3. If no other guidance is provided, increase published visibility by ½ mile.
         8.17.2.4.4. This paragraph applies only to the ALS itself, not to Visual Approach
         Slope Indicator (VASI) or Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI).
         8.17.2.4.5. (Added-USAFE) For non-USG approaches, aircrew are reminded to
         check the TERPS review letter for further restrictions when the ALS is inoperative
         (see paragraph 8.4.5).
  8.17.3. Conventional Approach. Pilots will fly conventional approaches IAW this
  instruction, AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, MDS-series Volumes 3, and other governing
  directives (including the AIM, when appropriate) as defined by the MAJCOM.
  8.17.3. (USAFE) Conventional Approach. Aircrew will ensure familiarity with any HN
  MIL AIP restrictions/requirements when flying TERPs-reviewed HN approaches. Copies of
  HN MIL AIP should be procured through HN liaisons to ensure the most current versions are
  referenced. The HQ USAFE/A3TV ICE will attempt to provide links to AIP sites as they are
  available.
  8.17.4. RADAR Approach. For pilots to fly a published radar approach or instrument
  approach procedure that requires radar to define a fix essential for flying the approach, a non-
  radar facility must provide a positive aircraft position within 25 NMs of the airfield. Pilots
  operating in Class A airspace may file to the nearest nonradar facility or fix (regardless of
  distance from the terminal) and request radar vector service to the terminal.
  8.17.4. (USAFE) RADAR Approach. IAW with the AFFSA document title ―USAFE/A3
  Operational Authorization with[in] the USEUCOM AOR‖ the requirement to use a non-radar
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                            85


  facility for fixing aircraft position with 25 NMs of the airfield is hereby waived. IAW the
  waiver document, USAFE/A3 authorizes all USAFE units to utilize this waiver as necessary
  to facilitate safe mission accomplishment. Reference the ―Waivers‖ folder on the
  USAFE/A3TV ICE for the most current version of the waiver document.
     8.17.4.1. (Added-USAFE) For units requiring to operate under this waiver, aircrew will
     place special emphasis on HN flying procedures, weather reporting capabilities of the
     operating location, fuel management, monitoring/use of all on-board navigation systems.
     8.17.4.2. (Added-USAFE) In addition to MDS-specific MESLs, each aircraft must be
     equipped with an operable point-to-point RNAV system (both INS and EGI if dual
     equipped), and at least two operable radios.
     8.17.4.3. (Added-USAFE) CAF (expect rotary-wing). There will always be two
     aircraft airborne at the same time (exception: a single-ship may be airborne if in the
     pattern preparing to land) to ensure wingman back-up for on-board RNAV systems and
     radio capability.
  8.17.5. Precision Runway Monitoring (PRM) Approach. Pilots shall not fly PRM
  approaches unless the pilot(s) and the aircraft are properly certified by the MAJCOM. Pilots
  unable to accept a PRM approach clearance must contact the Air Traffic Control System
  Command Center at 1-800-333-4286 to coordinate an arrival time. Without coordination,
  pilots should expect an ATC-directed divert to a non-PRM airport.
  8.17.5. (USAFE) Precision Runway Monitoring (PRM) Approach. Certification of
  pilots to fly PRM approaches will be completed and documented IAW AFI 11-2MDSV1 and
  local guidance. Aircraft certification is IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3 and TO guidance.
     8.17.5.1. TCAS II equipped aircraft will fly the ILS PRM approach in TA/RA mode.
     8.17.5.2. If an ATC breakout and a TCAS RA are received simultaneously, or shortly
     after one another, the pilot will respond to any turns required in the breakout instructions
     as well as the vertical correction required by the TCAS system.
  8.17.6. Self-Contained Approach (SCA). A MAJCOM-approved arrival procedure flown
  from a MIA to a landing surface using only the navigational equipment on board the aircraft
  (GPS, radar or other sensors). These procedures may be practiced in the NAS (or elsewhere
  with host-nation approval) under radar control, in conjunction with a published instrument
  approach procedure, in SUA or under VFR.
  8.17.6. (USAFE) Self-Contained Approach (SCA). SCAs may be practiced IAW the
  limitations in paragraph 8.17.6 at the following USAFE bases unless restricted by HN or
  local guidance: Aviano AB, Incirlik AB, RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, Moron AB,
  Ramstein AB, Spangdahlem AB.
     8.17.6.1. Airborne Radar Approach (ARA). ARAs are instrument approaches
     conducted using navigational guidance provided by reference to the aircraft’s on-board
     radar system. ARA’s conducted in IMC shall be developed and approved by the
     MAJCOM TERPS office. For the purposes of filing under IFR, ARA approaches will be
     considered published if they meet the requirements of paragraph 8.4.
     8.17.6.1. (USAFE) Airborne Radar Approach (ARA). IAW AFI 11-230,
     USAFE/APF (TERPS) is the only authorized source for creating ARAs within the
86                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


     USAFE AOR. Aircrew will request ARA creation/review by contacting HQ USAFE/APF
     (DSN: 314-480-7024; Comm: +49-6371-47-7024). ARAs will be executed IAW AFI 11-
     2MDSV3, local, and TO guidance.
     8.17.6.2. SCA using GPS or other sensors. MAJCOMs will publish specific guidance
     and restrictions on the use of SCAs such as Self-Contained Navigation Systems (SCNS),
     Mission Computer Approaches, SCAs using FMS or other GPS-based systems (or other
     sensors) that have not been certified to civil IFR instrument approach standards. These
     procedures fall outside the construct of published instrument approaches and should be
     flown under VFR or closely follow a published instrument approach ground track.
     MAJCOMs that permit their pilots to fly SCAs in IMC during tactical operations must
     publish SCA guidance that includes, at a minimum:
     8.17.6.2. (USAFE) SCA using GPS or other sensors. USAFE aircrew may fly SCA
     IAW paragraph 8.17.6.2, AFI 11-2MDSV3 and TO guidance as well as MDS-specific
     AFTTPs. If allowed by AFI 11-2MDSV3, aircrew may fly SCAs in IMC during
     contingency operations as long as all the criteria in paragraphs 8.17.6.2.1. through
     8.17.6.2.2. is included.
         8.17.6.2.1. SCA weather minimums, minimum final approach segment dimensions,
         tracks, and minimum altitudes, based on aircraft equipage and capabilities. Along the
         planned ground track, a minimum of 300 feet (250 feet with TF/TA) of obstacle
         clearance must be observed between the MIA and the MDA/DA; and
         8.17.6.2.2. SCA missed approach procedures and ground tracks will be established
         and assessed for obstructions along the planned escape ground track, and require no
         more than a 200 ft/nm climb gradient; and
         8.17.6.2.3. SCA allowable course deviation standards, required actions when those
         standards are exceeded, aircraft equipage requirements, pilot certification and
         proficiency rules, landing surface marking/lighting requirements, and minimum
         standards of navigation system accuracy required to commence the procedure; and
         8.17.6.2.4. SCA guidance to ensure corrections (i.e. temperature, restrictions to
         visibility, NOTAM information, obstacle data, etc.) are applied to the procedure.
         Corrections will be applied to the MDA/DA and other altitudes using the best
         available data.
  8.17.7. Temperature Correction. When the reported temperature at the altimeter setting
  source (normally the airfield), is lower than the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)
  temperature, the aircraft’s actual altitude will be lower than the barometric altimeter
  indicates. It is critical that pilots flying aircraft equipped with FMS that compensate for cold
  temperatures be familiar with the conditions under which the FMS calculates cold weather
  altitudes. During all flight operations, to maintain obstacle clearance, pilots will use the FIH
  chart (or FMS calculations) to apply cold weather corrections to barometric altitudes on IAPs
  IAW Table 8.2.
  8.17.7. (USAFE) Temperature Correction. For aircraft either not equipped with an FMS
  or not equipped with an FMS capable of cold temperature altitude calculations, reference
  Table 8.2 for when to apply the corrections and the following link for an electronic version
  of the FIH: https://dbgia.geointel.nga.mil/downloads/index.cfm.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                              87


       8.17.7.1. In lieu of MAJCOM guidance, while in IMC in mountainous terrain, pilots will
       plan to fly at least 1,000 ft above published minimum altitudes obtained from IFR
       enroute charts and terrain charts (e.g. MEAs, MOCAs, OROCAs or other minimum safe
       altitudes during low-levels, etc.) if the temperature at those altitudes is colder than 10°C
       below ISA.
       8.17.7.1. (USAFE) While flying IMC in mountainous terrain (as defined by paragraph
       2.11) in aircraft with no on-board outside air temperature (OAT) readings or ability to
       display temperature deviations from ISA, aircrew will adhere to the MIA appropriate for
       the phase of flight (see paragraph 8.13).
       8.17.7.2. Pilots will not apply a temperature correction to an ATC assigned altitude, but
       may refuse a lower altitude if obstacle protection is in doubt.
       8.17.7.3. When applying corrections to IAP altitudes, pilots will advise ATC if any
       applied correction exceeds 80 feet.

   8.17.8. Determining DH/DA/MDA. Pilots shall determine minimum approach altitudes
   (DH, DA or MDA) with the barometric altimeter except when flying a Category II/III ILS
   approach. When flying a Category II/III ILS approach use the radar altimeter to determine
   DH and use the barometric altimeter as a supporting instrument. Pilots shall not fly Category
   II or III approaches unless the pilot(s) and the aircraft are properly certified by the MAJCOM
   IAW appropriate civil standards. MAJCOM should direct procedures for the use of radar
   altimeters during all other approach types, including during tactical operations.
       8.17.8.1. (Added-USAFE) Certification of pilots to fly Category II/III approaches will
       be completed and documented IAW AFI 11-2MDSV1, and local guidance. Aircraft are
       certified IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3 and TO guidance. Once certified, pilots may fly Cat
       II/III ILS approaches IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, and TO guidance as well as MDS-
       specific AFTTPs.
 88                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


          8.17.8.1.1. (Added-USAFE) USAFE authorizes full use of radar altimeters IAW
          AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, and TO guidance on all approaches and during all tactical
          operations.
       8.17.8.2. (Added-USAFE) CAF (except for rotary wing) Pilot Weather Category
       (PWC). Reference Attachment 4 (Added) for guidance on determining PWCs for use in
       calculating appropriate instrument approach minimums.
   8.17.9. Descent Below DH/DA/MDA. Continuing an approach below DH/DA/MDA is not
   authorized until sufficient visual reference with the runway environment has been established
   and the aircraft is in a position to execute a safe landing. The term ―runway environment‖ is
   defined in the glossary and AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.
   8.17.10. Executing the Missed Approach. If on arrival at the MAP or DH/DA (or at any
   time thereafter) any of the requirements in paragraph 8.17.9. are not met, the pilot shall
   immediately execute the appropriate missed approach procedure, ATC issued climb out
   instructions or other ATC clearance.
       8.17.10.1. To ensure obstacle/terrain clearance, the missed approach procedure may not
       be initiated until over the MAP/DH/DA, unless otherwise cleared by ATC. Climbing
       prior to the MAP/DH/DA is permitted but ATC should be advised as soon as practical.
       8.17.10.2. Prior to starting any instrument approach, pilots will ensure their aircraft can
       accomplish the missed approach. Unless a higher climb gradient is published or assigned
       by ATC, maintain a minimum climb gradient of 200 ft/NM during the missed approach.
       ―Copter Only‖ approaches require a minimum climb gradient of 400 ft/NM. If, during an
       emergency, an aircraft is unable to comply with the missed approach routing or climb
       requirements, pilots should coordinate for alternate climb out instructions to ensure the
       aircraft will vertically clear all obstacles.
8.18. IFR "VFR-on-Top. " Unless otherwise restricted by the MAJCOM, PICs may request
and fly IFR "VFR on Top" operations (IAW AFMAN 11-217V2 guidance) when the mission
requires such clearances. If the PIC cancels the IFR clearance, comply with Chapter 7.
8.18. (USAFE)IFR "VFR-on-Top. " IFR ―VFR-on-Top‖ may only be used if specifically
allowed in AFI 11-2MDSV3 or as part of a formal course syllabus.
8.19. Performance Specification Airspace. PIC’s will ensure their aircraft is properly
equipped, certified, and approved before operating in any performance specification airspace
(e.g. MNPS/RVSM/RNP-10/BRNAV, etc). See CNS/ATM requirements in Chapter 2.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                                89


                                            Chapter 9

   CREW REST, FATIGUE MANAGEMENT AND FLIGHT DUTY LIMITATIONS

9.1. Background Information. This chapter prescribes mandatory crew rest and maximum
Flight Duty Periods (FDP) for all personnel who operate USAF aircraft. Basic guidance for
fatigue management strategies and waiver authority procedures are also addressed.
9.2. Waiver Authority. Procedures in this chapter may be waived by:
   9.2.1. MAJCOM/A3 when an ORM assessment determines that mission requirements justify
   the increased risk. At MAJCOM/A3 discretion, waiver authority may be further delegated to
   no lower than the operations group commander (or equivalent). Waivers to crew rest and
   flight duty limitations may be published in MAJCOM guidance or on a case-by-case basis.
   Exception: when authorized by the MAJCOM/A3, the PIC may extend maximum FDP up to
   2 hours to compensate for unplanned mission delays, provided the mission requirements
   justify the increased risk.
   9.2.1. (USAFE) FDP and Crew Rest Waivers. With concurrence of the PIC and if the
   mission justifies the increased risk, the following individuals are waiver authority for the first
   two hours of FDP and/or the first 12 hours of pre-departure crew rest:
       9.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) CAF. The owning OG/CC or designated representative.
       9.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) MAF. For training missions, approval authority is the
       owning OG/CC or designated representative. For HHQ-tasked missions, approval
       authority is the owning AOC/CC or comparable level of flying supervision if agreed
       upon between the owning AOC and the unit.
       9.2.1.3. (Added-USAFE) The WG/CC is approval authority for all other FDP/Crew
       Rest waivers. For all WG/CC-approved waivers, provide notification of approval to 3
       AF/CC and USAFE/A3 (through USAFE/A3T, with info to USAFE/A3TV).
       9.2.1.4. (Added-USAFE) Prior to issuing crew rest waivers, commanders will ensure
       ORM processes are in place to identify that the waiver exists and that all levels of flying
       supervision are aware of the effected aircrews’ status.
       9.2.1.5. (Added-USAFE) The PIC may extend the maximum FDP up to two hours
       without the above waiver approval authority provided the aircrew have exhausted all
       means to contact the appropriate approval authority and the mission justifies the risk.
       Affected aircrew will ensure they notify their flying chain of command as soon as
       practical upon mission completion or upon termination of the affected leg of a multi-leg
       mission, whoever occurs first.
   9.2.2. COMAFFOR (in the grade of O-8 or higher) for forces under his or her operational
   control during contingencies and impending or actual hostilities. Waiver authority may be
   delegated to no lower than Air Component Commander/A3 or equivalent level.
9.3. Fatigue Management Authorization. Regardless of authorized FDP, the PIC will restrict
duty time, extend crew rest periods or terminate a mission/mission leg if safety may be
compromised by fatigue factors.

9.4. Terms Explained.
   9.4.1. Aircrew or Crew. The full complement of military, civilian and contract personnel
   required to operate a USAF aircraft and to complete an assigned mission.
   9.4.2. Aircrew Member. An individual, designated on the Flight Authorization, who:
      9.4.2.1. Is an aircrew member as explained in AFPD 11-4, Aviation Service, AFI 11-402,
      Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, and,
      9.4.2.2. Is assigned to a position listed in AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning
      Factors, and,
      9.4.2.3. Is designated on orders to fulfill specific aeronautical tasks.
   9.4.3. Augmented Aircrew. A basic aircrew supplemented by additional aircrew members
   to permit in-flight rest periods IAW paragraph 9.4.8. If the basic aircrew requires only one
   pilot and a second qualified pilot (includes pilots enrolled in an AETC formal aircrew
   training course) is designated an aircrew member to augment pilot duties, the crew can be
   considered augmented.
   9.4.4. Basic Aircrew. Aircrew positions as defined in the aircraft T.O. (or MDS-specific
   AFI) for the normal operation of the aircraft or mission.
   9.4.5. Crew Rest Period. The crew rest period is normally a minimum 12-hour non-duty
   period before the FDP begins. Its purpose is to ensure the aircrew member is adequately
   rested before performing flight or flight related duties. Crew rest is free time, and includes
   time for meals, transportation, and rest. Rest is defined as a condition that allows an
   individual the opportunity to sleep.
   9.4.6. Flight Duty Period. FDP begins when an aircrew member reports for a mission,
   briefing, or other official duty and ends when engines are shut down at the end of the
   mission, mission leg, or a series of missions. FDP for UAS ends at final engine shut down,
   final in-flight handover briefing, or final crew swap, whichever occurs last.
   9.4.7. ―Deadhead‖ Time. For crew rest purposes, ―deadhead‖ time is computed as FDP. If
   an aircrew member will perform in-flight or crew-specialty related duties (i.e., aircraft off-
   loading or performance data calculations) in conjunction with ―deadheading‖, paragraphs
   9.8., 9.11., 9.12. and Table 9.1 apply.
   9.4.8. Sleeping Provisions. Sleeping provisions are crew bunks or other MAJCOM-defined
   rest facilities aboard the aircraft. Rest facilities should provide adequate privacy and noise
   levels to obtain suitable rest.
9.5. Alert Duty. MAJCOMs establish alert and compensatory periods in keeping with mission
requirements and an ORM assessment.
9.5. (USAFE) Alert Duty. Reference AFI 11-2MDSV3 and Attachment 6 (Added) for alert
guidance.
9.6. Maximum Flying Time. 56 hours flight time logged per 7 consecutive days, 125 hours
flight time logged per 30 consecutive days and 330 hours per 90 consecutive days.
9.7. Maximum FDP. (see Table 9.1)
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                                91


9.7. (USAFE) Maximum FDP. See waiver information in paragraph 9.2.1
   9.7.1. If official post-flight duties are anticipated to exceed 2 hours, commanders should
   consider reducing the FDP to ensure the safe completion of those duties.
   9.7.2. For single pilot aircraft or when only one pilot has access to the flight controls, the
   maximum FDP is 12 hours.
   9.7.2. (USAFE) Single-pilot aircraft. Maximum FDP when during night operations (not to
   include civil twilight) is 10 hours. Exception: Alert crews operating IAW paragraph 9.5 and
   aircrew on an ACC/AOS movement to/from the CONUS. In these cases the maximum FDP
   is IAW Table 9.1.

9.8. Crew Rest. Aircrew require at least 10 continuous hours of restful activities (including an
opportunity for at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep) during the 12 hours immediately prior to
the FDP. To ensure individual accountability and mission reliability, crewmembers should be
officially notified prior to entering a crew rest period. A crew rest period cannot begin until after
the completion of official duties.
9.8. (USAFE) Crew Rest. See waiver information in paragraph 9.2.1
   9.8.1. Crew rest is compulsory for any aircrew member prior to performing any of the
   following flight-related duties: preflight, load/unload, start, and taxi aircraft.
 92                      AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


   9.8.2. Each aircrew member is individually responsible to ensure that he or she obtains
   sufficient rest during crew rest periods. Activities that would prevent the opportunity to
   achieve at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep are discouraged.
9.9. Crew Rest Interruptions. Any official business or duty that requires the active
participation of an aircrew member interrupts the crew rest period. This includes official
business conducted on the telephone or other electronic means. If crew rest is interrupted so that
the individual cannot get an opportunity for at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep, the individual
must be afforded the opportunity for at least 8 more hours of uninterrupted sleep plus reasonable
time to dress, eat, travel, etc. Intentional crew rest interruptions shall only be made under the
most exceptional circumstances. The individual must consider unofficial interruptions so that
the intent of paragraph 9.8. is met. If crew rest is interrupted, individuals will inform a
supervisor and remove themselves from the flight schedule, when necessary.
9.9. (USAFE) Crew Rest Interruptions. USAFE defines ―active participation‖ as any activity
where the aircrew is not simply an observer, but is a contributing member of the activity or
receiving training.
9.10. Exceptions to the 12-Hour Minimum Crew Rest Period. For continuous operations
when basic aircrew FDPs are greater than 12 but less than 14 hours, subsequent crew rest may be
reduced proportionally to a minimum of 10 hours in order to maintain a 24-hour work/rest
schedule.
   9.10.1. Continuous operations means three or more consecutive FDPs of at least 12 hours
   duration separated by minimum crew rest.
       9.10.1.1. The 10-hour crew rest exception shall only be used to keep crews in 24-hour
       clock cycles, not for scheduling convenience or additional sortie generation.
       9.10.1.2. Any reduction from 12 hours crew rest requires pre-coordination for
       transportation, meals and quarters, so that crewmembers are provided an opportunity for
       at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep.
9.11. Scheduling Restrictions. Aircrews will not perform flight duties until the requirements of
paragraph 9.8 have been met.
   9.11.1. Aircrew members must maintain a medical clearance from the flight surgeon to
   perform in-flight duties. All medical or dental treatment obtained from any source must be
   cleared by a flight surgeon prior to reporting for flight duty.
   9.11.2. Use of any medication or dietary supplements is governed by AFI 48-123 and as
   approved by a flight surgeon. Aircrew members will not normally self-medicate. In the
   absence of other MAJCOM guidance, the following is a partial list of medications that may
   be used without medical consultation:
       9.11.2.1. Single doses of over-the-counter (OTC) aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen to
       provide analgesia for minor self-limiting conditions.
       9.11.2.2. OTC skin antiseptics, topical anti-fungals, 1 percent hydrocortisone cream, or
       benzoyl peroxide for minor wounds and skin diseases which do not hinder flying duties
       or wear of personal equipment.
       9.11.2.3. OTC antacids for mild isolated episodes of indigestion.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                            93


     9.11.2.4. OTC hemorrhoidal suppositories.
     9.11.2.5. OTC bismuth subsalicylate for mild cases of diarrhea.
     9.11.2.6. OTC oxymetazoline or phenylephrine nasal sprays may be carried should
     unexpected ear or sinus block occur during flight. Aircrew may only use such sprays as
     ―get me downs.‖ Do not use to treat symptoms of head congestion prior to flight.
     9.11.2.7. For information on medication, see Aerospace Medicine policy letters at:

  9.11.3. Aircrew members will not fly:
     9.11.3.1. Within 24 hours of compressed gas diving (including SCUBA), surface
     supplied diving, hyperbaric (compression) chamber exposure or aircraft pressurization
     checks (to below sea level) that exceed 10 minutes duration (this restriction not
     applicable to UAS ground control station operations).
         9.11.3.1.1. Exceptions: Following HEEDS training, aircrew may only fly within the
         24 hour window if the aircraft’s maximum altitude remains below 10,000 ft. MSL.
         Pararescue aircrew personnel will follow guidelines IAW US Navy Diving Manual
         on flying and diving restrictions.
     9.11.3.2. Within 12 hours after completion of a hypobaric (altitude) chamber flight
     above 25,000 ft. MSL. Personnel may fly as passengers in aircraft during this period,
     provided the planned mission will maintain a cabin altitude of 10,000 ft. MSL or less.
     For altitude chamber flights to a maximum altitude of 25,000 ft. MSL or below, aircrew
     members may fly without delay as crewmembers or passengers if their cabin altitude
     does not exceed 15,000 ft. MSL (this restriction not applicable to UAS ground control
     station operations).
     9.11.3.3. Within 72 hours after donating blood, plasma or bone marrow. The flying unit
     commander must approve donations of blood, plasma or bone marrow by aircrew

9.12. Alertness Management Strategies. Commanders, mission planners, aerospace medicine
personnel and crewmembers share responsibility for alertness management.
   9.12.1. MAJCOMs will emphasize alertness management programs or procedures to
   minimize the risks associated with aircrew fatigue. These should include:
      9.12.1.1. Commander’s Responsibilities. Commanders use reasonable means to
      manage the health and welfare of their crew forces. Use aircrew and family education to
      emphasize the importance of aircrew fitness and alertness on duty performance.
      Consultation with aerospace medicine or other fatigue management experts is advisable.
      9.12.1.2. Fatigue Mitigation. Mechanisms to ensure that at all stages of the mission,
      commanders, mission planners and PICs assess the impact of reduced aircrew alertness.
          9.12.1.2.1. Assessments should include the fatiguing effects of weather, extremes of
          temperature, nighttime operations and use of NVDs, poor sleeping conditions (due to
          both location and time of day), mission delays, and restrictive personal equipment.
             9.12.1.2.1.1. Commanders, mission planners, aerospace medicine personnel and
             PICs must continually execute ORM assessments and implement alertness
             management strategies such as: extending crew rest periods, pre-positioning
             crews, using sleep quarantine facilities, non-pharmacological countermeasures
             such as controlled cockpit rest, bright light or physical activity breaks;
             pharmacological agents (go and no-go pills), and fatigue management education
             and training.
          9.12.1.2.2. To combat cumulative fatigue, commanders should grant additional crew
          rest, or limit consecutive duty days, during surge, combat, max-effort, or operations
          near maximum FDPs.
             9.12.1.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Afford aircrew members a minimum of 24 hours
             crew rest following three consecutive FDPs of 16 hours or more with minimum
             crew rest between flights.
             9.12.1.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Aircrew member will not fly their first day back
             from a non-flying absence lasting 2 weeks or more. OG/CCs may dictate a shorter
             period based on individual experience, proficiency, and mission. Individuals must
             be given time to refresh on aircraft procedures and unit standards and be afforded
             the opportunity to participate in the mission planning for their first flight back.
      9.12.1.3. Fatigue Countermeasure Medications. MAJCOMs will provide guidance on
      the use of go and no-go medications IAW AF/SG policy. For more information see:
      https://kx.afms.mil/kxweb/dotmil/kj.do?functionalArea=AerospaceMedicine. This
      website contains policy letters, approved medications, forms, dosage and warnings for
      approved fatigue countermeasures medications. The website will be updated as required
      by AFMOA/SG3PF.
      9.12.1.3. (USAFE) Fatigue Countermeasure Medications. Aircrew will only use
      go/no-go medication IAW AF/SG policy, AFI 11-2MDSV3 and local guidance.
      9.12.1.4. Controlled Cockpit Rest. Unless further restricted in MAJCOM guidance or
      MDS specific Volume 3, controlled cockpit rest may be implemented when the basic
      aircrew includes a second qualified pilot. All cockpit crewmembers must remain at their
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                             95


      stations. Cockpit rest shall be limited to 45 minutes, taken by only one crew member at a
      time and must be restricted to non-critical phases of flight between cruise and one hour
      prior to planned descent. More than one rest period per crewmember is permitted.
      Cockpit rest is not authorized with any aircraft system malfunctions that increase cockpit
      workload (e.g., Autopilot, Navigation Systems). The resting crewmember must be
      roused immediately if a situation develops that may affect flight safety. Cockpit rest
      shall not be a substitute for any required crew rest.
   9.12.2. Flight publications describe procedures for loss of pressurization, oxygen, cockpit
   temperature control, inoperative autopilot, and other in-flight malfunctions or emergencies
   that restrict flight duration and contribute to aircrew fatigue. Such limitations in flight
   publications take precedence over less restrictive standards in this instruction.
9.13. Forms Prescribed. AF Form 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight Log; DD 175, Military
Flight Plan and DD 1801, DoD International Flight Plan.
9.14. Forms Adopted. See above and AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication (Flight Publications), DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest.
9.14. (USAFE)Forms Adopted: AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification; AF Form
4327, ARMS Flight Authorization; AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
Document; USAFE Form 116, Functional Check Flight (FCF) Training and Recurrency

Terms
Some terms printed here are reserved for future use or are intended to define a common
vocabulary for HQ AFFSA, MAJCOM, USAF aircrew and industry users of this AFI.—
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                             103


1090mHz Extended Squitter (1090 ES)—The most mature of the 3 ADS-B link options. A
―Squitter‖ provides a spontaneous transmission containing information about the aircraft’s
identification, position, altitude, velocity, and route of flight information. It uses the Mode S
transponders as a basis for operation.
8.33KHz spacing—Due to frequency congestion in the 118-137 MHz range (voice
communications) in Europe, the normal spacing between frequencies (25 kHz) was further
divided into three 8.33 kHz bands.
Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS—B)—Aircraft equipment that
automatically broadcasts routine messages which include its position (such as lat, long, altitude),
velocity, and altitude. Other information may also be included.
Aerobatics—Intentionally performed spins, vertical recoveries, and other maneuvers that require
pitch and bank angles greater than 90 degrees.
Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA)—HQ USAF Field Operating Agency (FOA)
charged with the development, standardization, evaluation and certification of procedures,
equipment and standards to support global flight operations. Centrally manages ATCALS, the
SDP program contract, performs combat flight inspection, and instructs the Air Force Advanced
Instrument School for USAF pilots. Central agency responsible for global USAF Terminal
Instrument Procedures. Headquartered at the FAA’s Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center in
Oklahoma City, OK.
Air Combat Tactics—A general term that includes basic fighter maneuvers, air combat
maneuvers, and air combat tactics.
Civil Twilight—Evening Civil Twilight is the period that begins at sunset and ends in the
evening when the center of the sun’s disk is 6 degrees below the horizon. Morning Civil
Twilight begins in the morning when the center of the sun’s disk is 6 degrees below the horizon,
and ends at sunrise. Use an authorized weather source, the latest version of the Air Almanac,
MAJCOM-approved computer program or US Naval Observatory data to determine and
calculate light and moon data. Both periods of twilight are considered ―day‖, unless further
restricted by the MAJCOM.
Communication, Navigation, Surveillance, and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM)—An
umbrella term used to describe the emerging avionics technologies and architecture of space- and
ground-based systems designed to bring about Free Flight. Examples include: RNAV/RNP,
RVSM, CPDLC, ADS-B, elementary and enhanced Mode S, 8.33 kHz radios, FM
Immunity, TCAS, and TAWS—Previously termed Global Air Traffic Management (GATM)
by the DoD.
Composite Flight Plan—A flight plan which specifies VFR operation for one portion of flight
and IFR for another portion.
Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CDPLC)—An ―email-like‖ data link between
pilots and ATC that will augment and may replace voice communications. The two
environments for CPDLC are currently Future Aeronautical Navigation System 1/A (FANS-1/A)
and the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN).
Critical Phase of Flight—For the purposes of this AFI, this term shall include: Terminal Area
operations including taxi, takeoff and landing, Low-level flight, Air Refueling, Airdrop, weapons
 104                     AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


employment, flight using NVGs, tactical/air combat and formation operations (other than cruise)
and all portions of any test or functional check flight or any aerial demonstration.
Day—The time between the beginning of morning civil twilight and the end of evening civil
twilight, as published in the Air Almanac, converted to local time.
Down link Aircraft Parameters (DAP)—This is data down-linked to the ground, via the Mode
S transponder, that provides information about the aircraft operations and planned route. The
three types of DAP are ―basic functionality‖ (flight ID, transponder capability, and flight status),
―enhanced‖ [EHS] and ―elementary‖ [ELS] surveillance features also provide flight intent
information.
Decision Altitude/Decision Height (DA/DH)—A specified altitude in the precision approach at
which a decision must be made to either continue the approach if the pilot acquires the required
visual references, or to immediately climb or execute a missed approach.   Outside the NAS,
Decision altitude is referenced to mean sea level and decision height is referenced to the
threshold elevation.
Diverse Departure—If the airport has at least one published approach, the absence of any non-
standard takeoff minimums and/or IFR departure procedures for a specific runway normally
indicates that runway meets diverse departure criteria. Pilots departing a diverse runway may
climb runway heading to 400 ft. above the DER elevation and then turn in any direction provided
the aircraft maintains a minimum climb gradient of 200 ft/NM until reaching the appropriate IFR
altitude. Published ―Sector‖ diverse departures (i.e. ―Diverse Departure authorized 145° CW to
278° with min climb gradient of…) are authorized as an Obstacle Departure Procedure.
Embedded GPS/INS (EGI)—A military, self-contained navigation system that provides
positioning, velocity, and acceleration data for the aircraft. The EGI receives signals from GPS.
The EGI receiver tracks up to five satellites simultaneously.
Enhanced Surveillance (EHS)—Support of EHS consists of populating and maintaining three
Mode S transponder registers beyond those required for ELS: Selected Vertical Intention, Track
and Turn Report, and Heading and Speed Report.
Elementary Surveillance (ELS)—Support of ELS consists primarily of populating and
maintaining four Mode S transponder registers: Data Link Capability Report, Common-Usage
Ground Initiated Comm B (GICB) Capability Report, Aircraft Identification (Flight ID), and
Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) resolution advisory.
Extended Operations (ETOPS)—Those operations conducted over large bodies of water, or
desolate land areas, outside of gliding distance to a suitable landing site.
FAA Authorization—An authorization is an official written FAA document which provides the
petitioner relief from specified parts of the CFRs.
FAA Exemption—An exemption is an official written FAA document which provides the
petitioner relief from specified parts of the CFRs.
Fault Detection/Exclusion (FDE)—A GPS receiver capable of autonomously determining
which GPS satellite(s) is (are) causing the RAIM alert and then excluding the faulty satellite(s)
from the navigation solution. Flight in some civil airspace requires both RAIM and FDE.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                              105


Flight Mission Computer/Flight Management System (FMC/FMS)—An on-board computer
system that uses a database to allow routes and other navigation data to be preprogrammed. The
system is updated with respect to position accuracy by reference to conventional navigation aids.
Formation Flight—More than one aircraft which, by prior arrangement between the pilots,
operates as a single aircraft with regard to navigation and position reporting. Separation between
aircraft within the formation is the responsibility of the flight leader and the pilots of the other
aircraft in the flight. This includes transition periods when aircraft within the formation are
maneuvering to attain separation from each other to effect individual control and during joinup
and breakaway. Such a group is treated for ATC purposes as a single aircraft.
Free Flight—A safe and efficient operating capability under instrument flight rules in which the
pilot has the freedom to select routing, altitude, and speed in real time.
Fuel Reserve—The amount of usable fuel that must be carried on each aircraft, beyond that
required to complete the flight as planned.
Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS)—GBAS augments ground systems (typically at
an airport) with equipment similar in functionality to a GPS satellite. This augmentation allows
a properly equipped aircraft to increase the accuracy of the vertical/lateral GPS solution. The US
LAAS is a GBAS equivalent system.
GNSS Landing System (GLS)—Hardware and software that augments the GPS SPS to provide
for precision approach and landing capability. Based on differential GPS concepts, the GLS
augments the basic GPS position data in order to increase the integrity, continuity, and accuracy
needed for a precision approach.
GPS-based Monitoring Unit (GMU)—An on-board monitoring and recording unit composed
of a GPS receiver, computer and flight deck windows antennae. An alternative to the ICAO
requirement of overflying a Height Monitoring Unit (HMU) as a means to check aircraft for
RVSM compliance.
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)—An umbrella term adopted by ICAO to
encompass any independent satellite navigation system. GNSS provides suitably equipped
aircraft with en route/terminal navigation with non-precision approach and precision approach
capabilities. The U.S. system is GPS.
Global Positioning System (GPS)—A constellation of satellites that enables the user to receive
signals from six operational satellites nearly 100% of the time from most locations on Earth.
RAIM and FDE ensures the GPS derived solution meets the accuracy, availability, and integrity
requirements critical to flight safety
Differential GPS (GPS-D)—DGPS is a GPS augmentation that uses differential corrections to
the basic satellite measurements that are performed within the receiver. DGPS is based upon
accurate knowledge of the geographic location of Earth reference stations. This knowledge is
used to compute corrections to GPS parameters, error sources, and/or resultant positions. These
differential corrections are then transmitted to GPS users, either from a ground-based station
[e.g., LAAS] or from a satellite-based system [WAAS, EGNOS, GALILEO, etc]. GPS receivers
apply the corrections to their received GPS signals and compute a more optimum position. For a
civil user, differential GPS can improve accuracy from 100 meters to better than 10 meters.

Global Positioning System- Precise Positioning Service (GPS-PPS)—The military maintains
exclusive access to the more accurate "P-code" (pseudo random code). It is much more accurate,
much harder to jam and spoof. To provide better protection to military aircraft, the DoD has
encrypted the P-code to form Y-code. Horizontal accuracy is less than ten meters.
Global Positioning System Standard Positioning Service (GPS- SPS)—One of two levels of
GPS service used by both the military and civil aviation community in order to support aircraft
navigation and landing. Since a Presidential Order turned Selective Availability off, SPS
horizontal accuracy is about ten meters [vs. about 100 meters when SA is on].
GPS ―Overlay‖ Approaches—These are instrument approaches that were previously approved
for use with GPS based on an existing traditional instrument approach such as a VOR or NDB
approach. As most of the ―Overlay‖ approach locations now have RNAV (GPS) approaches,
there is no GPS ―Overlay‖ approach authorization from the FAA in the NAS.
Ground Control Element—Comprises the UAS ground control station, power generation units,
communications infrastructure and antenna arrays.
Height Monitoring Unit (HMU)—A passive, ground-based system that measures the geometric
height of an aircraft for comparison with the geometric height of the flight level at which it is
being flown. The HMU calculates altimetry system error using meteorological information and
the Mode-C/S height data. Overflight of an HMU satisfies the ICAO requirement to check
aircraft for RVSM compliance. Additional information on RVSM monitoring program can be
found at: http://www.tc.faa.gov/act-500/niaab/rvsm/naarmo_intro.asp
ICAO—The International Civil Aviation Organization (a UN Specialized Agency),
headquartered in Montreal, Canada, is the global forum for civil aviation that works to achieve
its vision of safe, secure and sustainable development of civil aviation through cooperation
amongst its member States. Promotes understanding and security through cooperative aviation
regulation.
Inertial Navigation System (INS)—A self contained, dead reckoning system that senses the
acceleration along the three axes of the aircraft and calculates the distance traveled from a
reference point. Accuracy of the system decreases with time.
Instrument Meteorological Conditions—Meteorological conditions expressed in terms of
visibility, distance from cloud, and ceiling less than the minima specified for visual
meteorological conditions.
Lateral Navigation (LNAV)—A function of RNAV equipment which calculates, displays, and
provides lateral guidance to a profile or path.
Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO)—Procedures developed to expedite traffic flow at
civil and joint-use airports needing additional tools to increase capacity. Allows civilian aircraft
to operate on intersecting runways simultaneously.
Low Close-in Obstacles—Those obstacles within the Initial Climb Area that require an
excessive climb gradient to a climb-to-altitude of 200 feet or less above the Departure End of
Runway elevation or alternate takeoff weather minima. These obstacles are published in
NOTAMs, on the SID chart or in the IFR Take-off Minimums and (Obstacle) Departure
Procedures section of the terminal procedure booklet. Typical chart notation is: ―NOTE: Rwy
17L, tree 5610' from DER, 212' left of centerline, 82' AGL/2723' MSL.‖
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                             107


Minimum Fuel—Indicates that an aircraft's fuel supply has reached a state where, upon reaching
the destination, it can accept little or no delay. This is not an emergency situation but merely
indicates an emergency situation is possible should any undue delay occur.
Minimum IFR Altitude (MIA)—The lowest safe altitude permitted to be flown under IFR.
Normally, this is the lowest published IFR altitude (i.e. MEA, MOCA, OROCA, or ORTCA) for
a given area, not including any portion of an IAP. See paragraph 8.13.
Minimum Navigation Performance Specification (MNPS)—Implemented in the North
Atlantic region between FL285-420, it specifies a number of equipment, training, and procedural
requirements. MNPS navigation accuracy is equivalent to RNP 12.6. Dual long-range
navigation systems (LRNS) and dual long-range communication systems are required. RVSM is
mandatory in MNPS airspace. Aircraft that cannot meet dual LRNS requirements may be
accommodated on special routings ("Blue Spruce" routes). Aircraft that cannot meet RVSM
requirements are excluded from MNPS airspace unless operating on an ALTRV.
Mode 4—Transponder mode established to enable IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) functions
between military aircraft or military aircraft and military ground stations. Uses classified codes,
but operates on 1030 MHz and 1090 MHz, the same frequency pair used by the Air Traffic
Control Radar Beacon System that civil air traffic uses for Mode 3A/C, Mode S, and TCAS.
Mode 4 interrogation signals can suppress civil airborne transponders, therefore all Mode 4
operations in the NAS require prior authorization through the Air Force Frequency Management
Agency (AFFMA): affma.cc@pentagon.af.mil.
Mode 5—Mode 5 is the performance upgrade to the current Mark XII IFF transponder
system. Mode 5 provides new waveforms, new cryptography, more data, and improved radio
frequency (RF) link margin to resolve many of the deficiencies identified with Mark XII. It will
eventually replace the analog Mode 4 IFF system with digital IFF message formats which embed
unprecedented combat relevant data.
Mode Select (Mode S)—The primary role of the Mode S transponder is to "selectively" respond
to interrogations [as opposed to responding to all interrogations] from a ground sensor or TCAS
to provide airborne data information including identification, equipage, and altitude.
Mountainous Terrain—Defined in 14 CFR §95.11 for CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto
Rico. PANS-OPS defines mountainous terrain as an area over which the changes of surface
elevation exceed 900m (3,000 ft) within a distance of 18.5 km (10.0 NM), or 300 ft over a 1 NM
distance. AFFSA believes the PANS OPS definition is too restrictive, so instead chose to use the
definition from NATO’s ATP 56(B) (Part 3, Chapter 4) that defines mountainous terrain as 500
ft surface elevation change over a ½ NM distance.
National Airspace System (NAS)—The NAS is the common network of United States (U.S.)
airspace: air navigation facilities, equipment, services, airports or landing areas, aeronautical
charts, information/services, rules, regulations, procedures, technical information, manpower and
material. Included are system components shared jointly with the military. United States, in a
geographical sense, means (1) the States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the
possessions, including the territorial waters (within 12 nautical miles) and (2) the airspace of
those areas. Note: IAW ICAO Article 12 and Annex 2 and 11, the United States has accepted
responsibility for providing air traffic services within airspace overlying the high seas beyond 12
miles from the coast (also known as international airspace). These flight information regions of
 108                    AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


international airspace include: Oakland Oceanic, Anchorage Oceanic, Anchorage Continental,
Anchorage Arctic, Miami Oceanic, Houston Oceanic and New York Oceanic. Aircrews should
be aware that although they are being provided air traffic services by the FAA, they are operating
in international airspace and ICAO SARPS, FLIP, and AFIs are applicable. (See paragraph 1.2)
Night—The time between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil
twilight, as published in the Air Almanac, converted to local time.
Non-Standard Formation—Operations under any of the following conditions:
       a. When the flight leader has requested and ATC has approved other than standard
       formation dimensions (≤1 NM lateral separation or ≤ 100 ft. vertical separation).
       b. When operating within an authorized altitude reservation (ALTRV) or under the
       provisions of a letter of agreement.
       c. When operations are conducted in airspace specifically designed for a special activity.
Obstacle Climb Gradient—FLIP products often provide different climb gradients, ATC and
Obstacle. Only the obstacle climb gradient need be considered for OEI (if applicable) IFR
departure planning. If no obstacle climb gradient is published, the aircraft must achieve a
minimum climb gradient of 200 ft/NM (or as specified in paragraph 8.12.6.), OEI (if
applicable), on all IFR departures. VFR departures must meet or exceed only any published
gradient, OEI (if applicable), to an appropriate VFR cruise altitude or a MIA.
One Engine Inoperative—Multi-engine aircraft are typically certified as airworthy after
demonstrating satisfactory control authority and climb capability after suffering the loss of one
engine at the most critical moment on takeoff. USAF multi-engine aircraft must be operated so
the aircraft is capable of experiencing such an event and still vertically clear all departure path
obstacles (even at night or while IMC). Therefore, using civilian ―see and avoid‖ rules is
prohibited, unless specifically authorized by the MAJCOM/CC or as published in a Special
MAJCOM Certification procedure.
Operations Supervisor—This term is officially defined in AFI 11-418. MAJCOMS for which
that AFI does not apply (AFSOC/AMC/AFRC) should use an equivalent-level mission execution
authority position as the operations supervisor.
OROCA—An off-route altitude which provides obstruction clearance with a 1,000 ft. buffer in
non-mountainous terrain areas and a 2,000 ft. buffer in designated mountainous areas within the
United States. This altitude may not provide signal coverage from ground-based navigational
aids, air traffic control radar, or communications coverage.
ORTCA—An off-route altitude that provides terrain clearance with a 3,000 ft. buffer from
terrain. This altitude may not provide signal coverage from ground-based navigational aids, air
traffic control radar, or communications coverage. This altitude is used on en route charts
covering those areas outside the United States.
Passenger—An individual on board the aircraft who is not on the aeronautical orders IAW AFI
11-401. For the purpose of this AFI, MEPs are considered passengers.
P Airfield—Civil airport wherein permit covers use by transient military aircraft.
PANS-OPS—ICAO documents detailing specific procedures for the safety of air traffic
navigation agreed to by ICAO signatories.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                             109


Predictive RAIM (P-RAIM)—Using a standard set of algorithms, the availability of RAIM
may be determined based on the satellite coverage expected at an aircraft’s ETA. Due to terrain
masking and other factors (e.g. satellite fails after RAIM prediction made), P-RAIM does not
guarantee there will actually be sufficient satellite coverage on arrival. P-RAIM does not have
to reside in the GPS receiver. It can be provided by FAA Flight Service (US NAS only) and
other ground based RAIM algorithms.
Prevailing Visibility—The greatest horizontal visibility observed throughout at least half of the
horizon circle. It need not be continuous throughout 180 consecutive degrees.
PRM Approach—An instrument landing system (ILS) approach conducted to parallel runways
whose extended centerlines are separated by less than 4,300 ft. and the parallel runways have a
PRM system that permits simultaneous independent ILS approaches. See:
http://www.faa.gov/education_research/training/prm/.
Radar Required—This note on an instrument procedure indicates aircraft using the procedure
will be monitored by ATC radar during a particular phase of flight or throughout the entire
procedure, as applicable. Coordination with air traffic is necessary to ensure ATC capability and
agreement to provide these services before adding the note to any instrument procedure. Note:
Instrument procedures with radar requirements should be avoided whenever possible.
Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM)—RAIM is a two-step process used to
assess the integrity of the GPS signals in the receiver. First, the GPS receiver determines if five
or more working satellites are above the horizon and in the proper geometry to make RAIM
available. Second, based upon the range solutions from those satellites it must determine if the
RAIM algorithm indicates a potential navigation error. Flight in some civil airspace requires
RAIM and FDE.
Reduced Lighting—External aircraft lighting that is less than that required by paragraph 5.20.
Reduced Same Runway Separation—Allows reduction of the normal ATC aircraft separation
standards during landing/touch-and-go and restricted low approach operations to increase the
airport/runway capacity.
Reduced Takeoff Runway Length Procedure—Method used by TERPS to reduce high IFR
climb gradients by shortening the available takeoff runway, thus increasing the distance to the
obstacle, spot elevation, or terrain feature. Normally printed in the IAP    section as: “…or
alternatively, w/ standard takeoff minimums and a normal 200'/NM climb gradient, takeoff must
occur no later than 2200' prior to departure end of runway.” Aircrews are NOT permitted to
compute climb gradients in this manner.
Remotely Piloted Aircraft—The aircraft portion of an unmanned aircraft system. Normally,
Group 4 and 5 unmanned aircraft are considered RPAs, and are flown by RPA Pilots.
Remote/Island Destination—In the absence of more restrictive MAJCOM guidance, pilots will
consider a remote/island destination as any aerodrome that, due to its unique geographic
location, offers no suitable alternate within two hours flying time.
Required Navigation Performance (RNP)—Prescribes the system performance necessary for
operation in a specified airspace, based on its required accuracy (RNP value). The basic
accuracy requirement for RNP-X airspace is for the aircraft to remain within X nautical miles of
the cleared position for 95% of the time in RNP airspace.

RNAV–Area Navigation—Rather than fly established airways from one ground NAVAID to
another, RNAV permits suitably equipped aircraft to operate on any desired course between
virtual waypoints.
Runway Environment—The runway environment consists of one or more of the following
elements: The approach light system (except that the pilot may not descend below 100 ft. above
the Touch Down Zone Elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red
termination bars or the red side row bars are also visible and identifiable), the threshold,
threshold markings or threshold lights, the runway end identifier lights, the touchdown zone
lights, the runway or runway markings, the runway lights, the visual approach slope indicator.
For more information, refer to AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1.
Runway Visual Range—The maximum distance in the direction of takeoff or landing at which
the runway, or the specified lights or markers delineating it, can be seen from a position above a
specified point on its center line at a height corresponding to the average eye-level of pilots at
touch down. This value is normally determined by instruments located alongside and about 14
ft. above the runway and calibrated with reference to the high-intensity runway lights.
Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM)—Reduces the vertical separation between
properly equipped and certified aircraft to 1000 ft in special qualification airspace, normally
between FL290-410 inclusive.
Self-Contained Approach—An arrival procedure, normally from a minimum IFR altitude, to a
runway, using only navigational equipment on board the aircraft (GPS, radar, or other sensors).
Single Medium Display—A single medium display is a Head-Up Display (HUD), Head-Down
Display (HDD), or Helmet-Mounted Display (HMD) presenting flight instrumentation on a
single display such as a HUD combiner, a ―glass‖ multifunction display, or a helmet visor.
Special Departure Procedure—A procedure designed to allow a safe takeoff for multi-engine
aircraft whose OEI climb rate would otherwise not meet the TERPS minimum climb gradient
requirement. The runway and all known obstacles along a chosen takeoff path are analyzed and
compared to the aircraft OEI takeoff and climb performance. The procedure provides a
maximum allowable takeoff gross weight for given environmental conditions that ensure vertical
and lateral obstacle clearance safety margins. The minimum allowable gross and net climb
gradients for SDPs are typically lower than TERPS standards. Unlike TERPS, the takeoff path is
selected to minimize obstacle clearance requirements and only those obstacles within the lateral
limits of the chosen flight path are considered. Pilots should understand that most SDPs allow
exactly zero feet of clearance between their aircraft and the offending obstacles, and provide no
safety factor for pilot technique, less than 100% engine thrust, etc. The term SDP encompasses
both the use of the textual obstacle data table information and the graphical departure
procedures.
Standard Formation—A formation in which no participating aircraft is more than 1 NM
horizontally and 100 feet vertically from the lead aircraft.
Stopover Flight—A flight where intermediate stops are planned en route to a final destination.
Tactical Operations—Flight operations consisting of maneuvers that are unique to the
employment of air power to: gain and maintain air superiority, prevent freedom of operation for
the enemy in the objective area, and to assist naval and ground forces in the attainment of their
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                             111


objectives. Tactical operations must be specifically MAJCOM (or COCOM) defined, approved
and implemented. These operations are normally practiced only on training or exercise missions,
in a form of special use airspace or on designated training ranges or routes.
Terrain Alert Warning System (TAWS)—Generic term for any on-board system taking inputs
from terrain databases, radar altimeter, aircraft position sensors, etc. to activate a Ground
Proximity Warning System or Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS).
Developed to help prevent Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) mishaps.
Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)—An airborne system that functions
independently of the ground-based radar to provide collision avoidance protection between
suitably equipped aircraft. TCAS I provides proximity warnings to pilots in the form of traffic
advisories. TCAS II provides both traffic advisories and recommended vertical escape
maneuvers, known as resolution advisories.

Terminal Area Operations—Terminal area operations are normally those flight phases
conducted within 30 NM of an airfield of intended departure or landing, or those operations on
charted Standard Instrument Departures, on charted Standard Terminal Arrivals (STARs), or
other flight operations between the last enroute fix/waypoint and an initial approach
fix/waypoint.
Unmanned Aircraft System—A control station, one or more unmanned aircraft, control and
payload datalinks, and mission payloads, designed or modified not to carry a human pilot and
operated through remote or self-contained autonomous control. A UAS must meet all applicable
requirements of a manned aircraft, unless specifically exempted. The term RPA is specific to the
Remotely Piloted Aircraft (the flying portion of the UAS).
Unmonitored Navigational Aid—Most NAVAIDs have internal monitoring systems that
provide automatic shutdown or notification when a malfunction occurs. Unmonitored
NAVAIDs lack the ability to immediately notify ATC when a malfunction occurs. The pilot
may still use the NAVAID for all types of navigation, including instrument approaches, but must
monitor the NAVAID for a loss of identification since no prior warning of operation may be
available from ATC.
Visual Meteorological Conditions—Meteorological conditions in which visual flight rules may
be used; expressed in terms of visibility, ceiling height, and aircraft clearance from clouds along
the path of flight. When these criteria do not exist, instrument meteorological conditions prevail
and instrument flight rules must be followed.
VFR-on-Top—ATC authorization for an IFR aircraft to operate in VFR conditions at any
appropriate VFR altitude (as specified in FLIP and as restricted by ATC). A pilot receiving this
authorization must comply with the VFR visibility, distance from cloud criteria, and the
minimum IFR altitudes specified in Chapters 7 and 8.
VFR- over-the-Top—VFR flight maneuver during which an aircraft on a VFR flight plan
climbs over a ceiling in VMC, maintains VMC above the clouds, then descends in VMC and
lands.
Vertical Navigation (VNAV)—A term that describes using GPS lateral and vertical guidance to
define the minimums for a GPS non-precision or precision approach.

Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)—The U.S. implementation of Space Based
Augmentation System (SBAS), a satellite navigation system consisting of the equipment and
software which augments the GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS).
World Geodetic Survey—1984 (WGS-84)—Developed by the U.S. for world mapping, WGS
84 is an earth fixed global reference frame. It is the ICAO standard.

         PILOT WEATHER CATEGORY (PWC) DETERMINATION AND USE

A4.1. (Added) Use the following guidance to assign PWCs for use in determining appropriate
instrument approach minimums.
A4.2. (Added) SQ/CCs will assign a PWC according to the individual’s assessed
proficiency and capability, but in no case lower than the criteria specified in Table A4 1.
(Added). Annotate PWCs on the unit Letter of Xs (see AFI 11-202V2_USAFESUP_I).
    A4.2.1. (Added) Non-USAFE aircrew who fly USAFE aircraft on a temporary basis will
    use the PWCs of their parent MAJCOM or as annotated on cross command Letter of
    Agreement (LOA). Completion of local TI academics is a prerequisite to use any other
    MAJCOM PWCs in the USAFE AOR less than 700/2.
    A4.2.2. (Added) During the hours of daylight (including civil twilight) at the home airfield,
    OG/CCs may authorize all MR pilots to use published approach minimums rather than
    PWCs. This authorization may not be delegated, but may be published in local guidance as a
    blanket authorization.
    A4.2.3. (Added) F-15/F-16. If an IP occupies the rear cockpit, the IP’s PWC may be used.
    A4.2.4. (Added) If non-current for a precision approach (see AFI 11-2MDSV1 and
    associated RAP Tasking Message), increase PWC by one category until currency is regained.
    A4.2.5. (Added) For formation approaches use the most restrictive PWC in the formation,
    but in no case less than AFI 11-2MDSV3 weather requirements.
    A4.2.6. (Added) For straight-in approaches, calculate DH/MDA at each PWC by
    referencing the following elevations in order of priority: touch-down-zone elevation (TDZE),
    runway threshold elevation (THRE), field elevation.
    A4.2.7. (Added) For circling approaches, calculate MDA by referencing the airport/airfield
    elevation.

       NOTE 1: Landing surface is 125 percent of takeoff/landing distance or stated runway
       length, whichever is greater
       NOTE 2: HN-equivalent arresting gear is acceptable if listed in the FIH
       NOTE 3: Aircrew must verify the capability/compatibility of arresting systems not listed
       in the FIH by contacting HN airfield management or other HN contacts (to include the
       Defense Attaché if direct HN contact is not possible) prior to arrival.

   A5.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Security provisions compatible with the aircraft or equipment
   classification must be available at the airfields. Aircrew will coordinate with their wing
   security office for the most updated published guidance. The following references are
   provided for aircrew awareness and should be a part of every unit’s off-station aircraft
   security procedures: FCG, AFI 31-101, AFI 31-401, and associated USAFESUPs.
A5.2. (Added-USAFE) Responsibilities:
   A5.2.1. (Added-USAFE) USAFE bases will establish command post procedures for flight
   following during off-station training flights. Parent unit command posts will monitor unit
   aircraft on all flight segments. The base of departure will pass the following information to
   the scheduled destination base: call sign, departure time, estimated time of arrival, and
   alternate airfields. When departing other than home station, aircrew will place the following
   statement in the remarks section of DD 1801, DoD International Flight Plan: ―RMK/PASS
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                            119


  ATD-ETA TO XXXX BASE OPERATIONS‖ (XXXX being ICAO identifier for parent unit
  airfield).
  A5.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Units will ensure the responsible individual at their parent unit
  (e.g. Ops Sup, SOF, OG/CC, etc.) is immediately notified when destination base weather
  deteriorates.
  A5.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Aircrew will contact their parent unit command post after
  completing each day’s flights with the flight times and aircraft status. The PIC will ensure the
  installation command post (if available) has the PICs lodging location and telephone number.
  A5.2.4. (Added-USAFE) PICs will inform parent units of changes to itinerary prior to
  occurrence, if practical. If unable, report itinerary changes to parent command post as soon as
  practical upon landing at the next destination.
  A5.2.5. (Added-USAFE) Units will include cross-country checklists in in-flight guides.
  Checklists should include pre- and post-flight procedures, with emphasis on aircrew-to-
  ground crew communication. Aircrew supervision of servicing operations at non-USAFE
  bases is required. At bases where arresting systems are listed as ―available upon request,‖
  aircrew will verify suitable departure end arresting gear is rigged prior to takeoff.
  A5.2.6. (Added-USAFE) Sustained deployed operations such as contingency operations or
  weapons training deployments operate under the control of contingency operation Special
  Instructions (SPINS) and host unit procedures.

                                Attachment 6 (Added-USAFE)
                                 USAFE ALERT GUIDANCE

A6.1. (Added-USAFE) Alert Duty. Unless specified in AFI 11-2MDSV3, units will use the
following alert procedures:
A6.2. (USAFE) Alert scheduling. Do not schedule an aircrew member for more than 7 days
of continuous alert duty. Following a 7-day tour, an aircrew must have a minimum of 24 hours
rest time away from the alert site before beginning a subsequent alert tour. If aircrew swap-out is
delayed following a 7-day tour, an aircrew may extend for one 24-hour period with sector/
Director of Operations (DO) approval.
   A6.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Qualified pilots may be placed on alert regardless of their PWC.
   If observed or forecast weather is below PWC criteria, pilots will be placed on mandatory
   alert status.
       A6.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) ―Mandatory alert status‖ is a status whereby the aircrew
       will only scramble for a launch if given a Mandatory Scramble Order (MSO).
       A6.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) MSOs will only be directed for real world events requiring
       immediate response. In no case will an aircrew launch if they consider conditions unsafe
       for flight.
   A6.2.2. (Added-USAFE) An alert aircrew or alert site commander may put the site on
   restricted or ―mandatory alert status‖ at any time due to crew rest considerations (actual
   /planned tasking, fatigue, or other factors).
A6.3. (Added-USAFE) Flight Duty Period (FDP).
   A6.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Initial FDP is IAW Chapter 9 guidance and begins with the first
   squadron duty or alert changeover briefing, whichever occurs first. After the first crew rest
   period while on alert, subsequent FDPs begin with any official tasking and will not exceed 12
   hours.
   A6.3.2. (Added-USAFE) The FDP for alert aircrews traveling to the alert sight via
   commercial air begins one hour prior to the scheduled commercial air takeoff. For alert
   aircrews traveling via military air, the FDP begins upon arrival at the squadron for mission
   preparation/briefing.
   A6.3.3. (Added-USAFE) Planned taskings (e.g. training sorties, aircraft swaps, etc.) will
   not exceed the FDP. If an actual alert tasking results in an aircrew member exceeding the
   FDP, replace or put the aircrew on ―mandatory alert status‖ until crew rest is attained.
   A6.3.4. (Added-USAFE) An aircrew member may fly up to three sorties during an FDP.
   Alert scrambles do not have a day/night combination limit. Upon reaching the sortie limit,
   replace the aircrew member or put on ―mandatory alert status‖ until crew rest is attained.
   A6.3.5. (Added-USAFE) An aircrew member may perform non-alert duty after being on
   alert if Chapter 9 crew rest requirements are met. The post-alert duty day begins at
   changeover, scramble activity (including battle stations or a "suit-up" call), or other official
   tasking, whichever occurs first.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                          121


A6.4. (Added-USAFE) Crew Rest
  A6.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Upon assuming alert duties, alert aircrew enter crew rest. For
  same day aircrew swap-outs at the end of the aircrew 12-hour crew duty day, the unit will go
  on ―mandatory alert status‖ until aircrew have had the opportunity for 8 hours of
  uninterrupted rest. After required crew rest is obtained aircrews may begin a FDP IAW A6.3
  (Added).
  A6.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Normal sleeping hours. Except for actual alert tasking, do not
  disturb alert crews from 2200-0600L. For any planned missions (actual alert or training) that
  start during, or extend into the period 2200-0600L, make all possible attempts to notify
  aircrew members in enough time for mission preparation and crew rest. Any tasking or duty
  accomplished by the aircrew during this period will be considered official duties and will
  impact crew rest and FDP determinations. This includes those duties in paragraph A6.4.3.2
  (Added) that do not normally affect crew rest and FDP (e.g. obtaining weather/ NOTAMS,
  power-on checks, aircraft acceptance).
  A6.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Once meeting Chapter 9 crew rest requirements, aircrew may
  start a new alert FDP. The crew rest period for alert is defined as the period when official
  alert duties are not being performed.
     A6.4.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Official alert duties are defined as alert scrambles to include
     battle stations, runway alert, hot cocking, or a suit-up call.
     A6.4.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Official alert duties do not include checking weather,
     NOTAMS, Power-on checks (i.e. those checks accomplished without engine start, or
     aircraft acceptance), and walk around and forms check if performed during the hours of
     0600-2200L.
  A6.4.4. (Added-USAFE) Restricted status. If the air defense sector and the unit determine
  that the aircrew needs to be put into crew rest due to probable future tasking, they may place
  the unit on restricted status.
     A6.4.4.1. (Added-USAFE) When on restricted status, alert crews will be in crew rest.
     A6.4.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Restricted status differs from ―mandatory alert status‖ in
     that it does not require up-channel reporting or prevent a HHQ tasking.
  A6.4.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Squadron Supervision. Squadron supervisors recalled to
  perform supervisory/ SOF duties during an actual alert scramble do not need to meet crew
  rest requirements for that duty. However, they must obtain required crew rest before
  returning to duty if scheduled to fly.

                              Attachment 7 (Added-USAFE)
  FUNCTIONAL CHECK FLIGHT (FCF)/OPERATIONAL CHECK FLIGHT (OCF)
                           GUIDANCE

A7.1. (Added-USAFE) General. Guidance in this attachment is in addition to AFI 21-
101_COMBATAIRFORCESUP_I, Chap 8, and TO 1-1-300. In addition to the aircraft listed in
AFI 21-101 (C-130, C-135), units with OSA/VIP/SAM aircraft rarely perform FCFs. When an
FCF is needed the OG/CC issues temporary written certification designating the most highly
qualified crews available (also reference AFI 11-2MDS guidance on FCFs).
A7.2. (USAFE) Responsibilities: :
   A7.2.1. (Added-USAFE) OG/CC will:
       A7.2.1.1. (Added-USAFE) Appoint an FCF program manager.
       A7.2.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Select only highly qualified individuals as FCF flight crews.
   A7.2.2. (Added-USAFE) FCF OIC will (at OG/CC discretion, any of these items may be
   delegated to a squadron-level FCF OIC):
       A7.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Ensures a standard FCF profile and associated procedures
       are established for each type of assigned aircraft IAW TO 1-1-300.
       A7.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Ensure the FCF certification and training program consists
       of: aircraft review of applicable FCF publications, local FCF procedures for the type of
       aircraft being flown, applicable -6 TO worksheets, and procedures for aircrew training
       devices (ATD) if applicable.
       A7.2.2.2. (AVIANOAB) [31 FW] Prior to executing a FCF, transient aircrew will
       receive a brief from the FCF Program Manager (PM) or a current FCF pilot covering the
       following: local radio and radar procedures, bailout and jettison procedures, area
       boundaries, area entrance and exit procedures, and emergency airfields. 31 FW FCF
       pilots performing FCF sorties off station will receive a brief from local authorities
       covering the above items.
          A7.2.2.2.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) New FCF pilots will accomplish the full upgrade
          program IAW Attachment 10.
              A7.2.2.2.1.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) FCF-1 is a full FCF profile flown in the
              simulator (UTD or MTC). See Attachment 11 for FCF-1 requirements.
              A7.2.2.2.1.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) FCF-2 is a full FCF profile flown in an F-
              16D with the Upgrading Pilot (UP) in the front cockpit, and a current FCF pilot in
              the rear cockpit. A chase aircraft will not be used for FCF-2. The configuration
              will be clean; however the aircraft can be configured with pylons on stations 1
              and 9 with no stores. The F-16D flown for FCF-2 will not require an actual FCF.
              See Attachment 12 for FCF-2 requirements.
              A7.2.2.2.1.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) When training is completed and
              Attachment 10 is signed by 31 OG/CC the original will be kept in the FCF pilot’s
              grade book. FCF qualification will also be annotated on the squadron Letter of
              Qualification (LOX) and FCF currencies will be tracked in Patriot Excalibur (PEX).
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                           123


          A7.2.2.2.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Pilots who are previously FCF qualified in the F-
          16 from another base, and are not out of currency by more than 180 days, may
          accomplish an abbreviated upgrade. The abbreviated program will include all of the
          initial ground training and an initial FCF Simulator with a current FCF pilot, but the
          initial FCF is not required. Individuals who are previously FCF qualified in the F-16
          but are out of currency by more than 180 days will accomplish a qualification
          program determined by the OG/CC on a case by case basis and documented in a
          memorandum kept in the pilot’s grade book that outlines the program requirements.
      A7.2.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Develop a written examination of no less than 25 questions
      based on applicable FCF publications.
          A7.2.2.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Passing grade is 85% with any missed questions
          corrected at the time of grading.
          A7.2.2.3.2. (Added-USAFE) The exam will be administered and filed (the PEX
          Stan/Eval module may be used) by OGV. The exam will be reviewed and rewritten
          annually.
      A7.2.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Review FCF results quarterly for trends, identifies deficient
      areas, and forwards recommendations for improvements to applicable OG leadership for
      review or action.
A7.3. (Added-USAFE) FCF Aircrew Management. Reference AFI 11-2MDSV1 certification
and currency guidance. If no guidance exists, the following will be used.
   A7.3.1. (Added-USAFE) FCF Aircrew Designation. Unless otherwise stipulated in AFI
   11-2MDS volumes, use the following minimum hourly criteria, including UPT time for
   pilots, to nominate aircrew for FCF certification:
      A7.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) 750 hours total and 200 hours PAA time.
      A7.3.1.2. (Added-USAFE) 650 hours total and 300 hours PAA time.
      A7.3.1.3. (Added-USAFE) 575 hours total and 400 hours PAA time.
   A7.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Currency. In addition to performing an actual FCF flight, FCF
   currency may be updated by accomplishing an FCF profile in an MTC, UTD, or equivalent,
   but aircrew must be under the supervision of an FCF-certified aircrew (either in the sim or on
   the console). FCF currency may also be updated by flying an FCF training profile with a
   certified FCF aircrew either as chase or in the rear cockpit (if equipped).
      A7.3.2.1. (Added-USAFE) FCF pilot currency for single seat aircraft is 90 days.
      A7.3.2.2. (Added-USAFE) FCF pilots of single-engine aircraft must maintain a 30-day
      simulated flame-out (SFO) landing currency. Currency shall be updated/regained IAW
      AFI 11-2MDSV1 (i.e. updating currency may be done in an MTC, but regaining lost
      currency must be done in-flight).
      A7.3.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Non-current FCF aircrew will not perform actual FCF
      flights until currency is achieved. To regain currency, FCF aircrew must accomplish
      either:
 124                    AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


          A7.3.2.3.1. (Added-USAFE) An FCF profile in an MTC, UTD, or equivalent under
          the supervision of an FCF-certified aircrew (either in the sim or on the console).
          A7.3.2.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Flying an FCF training profile with a certified FCF
          aircrew either as chase or in the rear cockpit (if equipped)
       A7.3.2.4. (Added-USAFE) If an FCF aircrew remains non-current for more than six
       months, an FCF certification program will be reaccomplished. Waiver authority is the
       OG/CC, or designated representative.
       A7.3.2.4. (AVIANOAB) [31 FW] The FCF certification program for aircrew more than
       180 days non-current will be determined by the OG/CC on a case by case basis and
       documented in a memorandum kept in the pilot’s grade book that outlines the program
       requirements.
       A7.3.2.5. (Added-USAFE) At OG/CC discretion, currently active-duty but previously-
       certified FCF aircrew may be designated as FCF sim supervisors for the purposes of
       updating/regaining currency. Document designations via official memo and archive with
       FCF OIC program information.
   A7.3.3. (Added-USAFE) If an FCF is needed during a TDY and an FCF crew is not
   available, the SQ/CC or designated representative, may issue temporary certification,
   designating the most highly qualified aircrew available to perform FCF duties. The
   certification will terminate upon completion of the TDY.
A7.4. (Added-USAFE) Flight Requirements.
   A7.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Do not shut down engines while airborne unless the requirement
   is explicitly identified in the -6 and -1 TOs.
   A7.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Fly FCFs under IFR to the maximum extent practical. If required
   to perform an FCF under VFR, then radar flight following (or HN equivalent) will be used to
   maximum extent practical.
   A7.4.3. (Added-USAFE) A supervisor of flying (SOF) will be in the control tower for all
   fighter aircraft FCFs conducted at home station or deployed locations (i.e. SOF not required
   for FCFs conducted at European depot locations).
   A7.4.4. (Added-AVIANOAB) Weather Requirements
       A7.4.4.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) FCFs will be flown between the hours of sunrise and
       sunset.
       A7.4.4.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) FCFs will be conducted under VMC. The FCF pilot
       may briefly penetrate IMC to complete the FCF in VMC above the clouds if all aircraft
       systems are operating normally.
       A7.4.4.3. (Added-AVIANOAB) If the FCF engine checks will be accomplished then
       the weather required for the FCF is 8,000 ft ceiling and 8,000 m visibility and must allow
       the pilot to be able to reasonably complete a flameout landing if necessary. If the OG/CC
       and MXG/CC have approved a reduced FCF profile without engine checks then the
       weather required is 3,000 ft ceiling and 5,000 m visibility and must allow the pilot to be
       able to reasonably complete a visual straight in. This will allow the pilot to takeoff in
       VMC then penetrate weather as outlined in paragraph A7.4.4.2 or return to base VFR if
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                         125


     required. If an airfield other than the takeoff airfield is to be used as the primary
     emergency recovery base then the weather at that airfield must also meet the above
     requirements. Additionally, if the planned recovery base is single runway then pilots
     must designate and carry fuel for a backup divert that is at least 3,000’/5km.
  A7.4.5. (Added-AVIANOAB) OCF flights should be flown by an experienced Combat
  Mission Ready/Basic Mission Capable (CMR/BMC) pilot. OCF flights may be flown in
  conjunction with other missions and varied weather conditions as long as the pilot in
  command determines that the issue requiring the OCF flight does not interfere with safe
  operations.
  A7.4.6. (Added-AVIANOAB) All FCFs, actual or simulated, will be debriefed. Pilots will
  fill out the supersonic log if applicable. Additionally pilots will annotate discrepancies on
  the AFTO 781As. If released from FCF then pilots will sign off the FCF write up in the
  AFTO 781As.
  A7.4.7. (Added-AVIANOAB) High-Speed Taxi Procedures.
     A7.4.7.1. (Added-AVIANOAB) In the event of a check-out that requires the aircraft to
     run at higher than normal taxi speeds but not fly, only experienced CMR/BMC pilot will
     be used and the checkout will be accomplished on a runway.
     A7.4.7.2. (Added-AVIANOAB) Higher than normal taxi speed is defined as operations
     above 30 knots straight ahead, 10 knots turning, or other technical order guidance,
     whichever is slower.

                      OPERATIONS NEAR VOLCANIC ACTIVITY

A8.1. (Added-USAFE) The guidance in this attachment is derived from experiences during
recent volcanic eruptions within the USAFE AOR (e.g. Iceland, Sicily) as well as reference to
UK Civil Aviation Administration (CAA), EUROCONTROL, and ICAO documentation.
Reference the following documents/links for more information (if a link does not work, perform

A8.2. (Added-USAFE) Definitions. Ash concentration levels of ―low‖, ―medium‖, and ―high‖
are IAW the definitions in the ICAO EUR/NAT Volcanic Ash Contingnecy Plan (ICAO EUR
Doc 19 and NAT Doc 06 Part II, December 2010 edition), found at the following link:
http://www.paris.icao.int/documents_open/files.php?subcategory_id=63.
   A8.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Volcanic Activity. Both the volcano itself (i.e. the volcanic
   eruption) and any noticeable indications of volcanic ash (e.g. visible ash, acrid odors, etc.) as
   well as any actual or forecast areas of ―medium‖ or ―high‖ ash contamination.
   A8.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Volcanic Activity Buffer Zone (VABZ). The zone outside of
   volcanic activity where ash is forecast, but may not be seen with the naked eye. Additionally,
   the effects of volcanic ash will likely not be immediately noticeable (if at all). This zone
   implies an increased level of ORM, vigilance to aircraft performance during flight, and post
   flight reporting requirements.
       A8.2.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The VABZ includes any actual or forecast areas of ―low‖
       ash contamination.
       A8.2.2.2. (Added-USAFE) NOTE. A VAAC may also produce a ―Volcanic Ash
       Advisory Graphic‖ with lines depicting ash concentrations at various altitudes (see

       chart are rough equivalents of the VABZ boundary (areas of medium/high ash
       concentration are not depicted), but DO NOT depict the boundary of ―Volcanic Activity‖.
   A8.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Terminal Area. For the purpose of this guidance, the Terminal
   Area is defined as within the boundaries, both laterally and vertically, of Class B, C, or D
   airspace depending on the class of field where operations are being conducted.

A8.3. (Added-USAFE) Operational Guidance.
   A8.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Volcanic Activity.
       A8.3.1.1. (Added-USAFE) IAW paragraph 5.26.5, Flight in/through/over/under
       Volcanic Activity is prohibited, ―Unless conducting rescue operations or when authorized
       by the MAJCOM/A3,‖ (see paragraph A8.6 (Added)).
       A8.3.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Accomplish post-flight reporting of               any    activity
       in/through/over/under Volcanic Activity IAW paragraph A8.5 below.
   A8.3.2. (Added-USAFE) VABZ. Flight operations in/through/over/under the VABZ are
   allowed at OG/CC discretion; however, aircrew/units must accomplish post-flight reporting
   IAW paragraph A8.5 below (flights over/under the VABZ do not require reporting).
   A8.3.3. (Added-USAFE) Visible Ash. In all cases, aircrew will not fly through visible ash
   regardless of the forecast ash contamination level.
       A8.3.3.1. (Added-USAFE) If aircrew witness unforecasted visible ash they will avoid it
       by a minimum of 5000’ vertically or 60NM laterally and make every effort to issue a
       PIREP for follow-on flights. If aircrew are within these limits at the time of ash
       encounter, they will take the most expeditious routing to achieve these limits or greater
       recognizing that higher power settings associated with climbs may exacerbate ash
       damage to the engines).
       A8.3.3.2. (Added-USAFE) If overflying unforecast visible ash, aircrew will brief
       contingency plans for emergencies that may require immediate descents.
   A8.3.4. (Added-USAFE) Terminal Area Operations.
       A8.3.4.1. (Added-USAFE) In/near Volcanic Activity and/or visible ash. USAFE
       missions may operate DAY-ONLY without a waiver under the following provisions
       (waiver authority is HQ USAFE/A3—see paragraph A8.6):
          A8.3.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) The PIC determines that the approach, missed
          approach, and/ or departure can be flown while avoiding Volcanic Activity and/or
          visible ash by at least 10NM.
          A8.3.4.1.2. (Added-USAFE) The area of Volcanic Activity and/or visible ash is not
          forecast or observed to be moving in the direction of the approach/departure/missed
          approach corridor.
       A8.3.4.2. (Added-USAFE) In/Near the VABZ. No restrictions. Post fight reporting
       may be required (see paragraph A8.3.2 and A8.5)
   A8.3.5. (Added-USAFE) Operations during HN airspace closure.
       A8.3.5.1. (Added-USAFE) If HN civil/military airspace is closed due to observed or
       suspected volcanic ash (regardless of VAAC product depictions), USAFE flight
       operations will also be suspended in that airspace..
       A8.3.5.2. (Added-USAFE) If civil/military airspace opens but HN is not providing IFR
       services, USAFE aircraft are permitted to conduct VFR operations IAW AF 11-202V3,
       Chapter 7 and this attachment.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                              129


       A8.3.5.3. (Added-USAFE) Case-by-case waivers may be granted by USAFE/A3 to
       operate in/through airspace closed by the HN, but will be limited only to Urgent
       Aeromedical Evac and SAR or SAR-support missions (see paragraph A8.6).
A8.4. (Added-USAFE) Operational Risk Management (ORM). Before allowing flights
in/through their airspace, certain European ATC agencies may require proof of an ORM
assessment regarding flight operations in forecast volcanic ash (as depicted by VAAC products).
Units will therefore, at a minimum, accomplish the following items.
   A8.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Add an item in unit-standard pre-flight ORM assessments when
   flying IAW paragraph A8.3. Units will assign a severity index consistent with unit ORM
   standards IAW with the following hierarchy (from most severe to least severe):
       A8.4.1.1. (Added-USAFE) In Volcanic Activity
       A8.4.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Within 60 NM of Volcanic Activity
       A8.4.1.3. (Added-USAFE) Inside the VABZ, but outside 60 NM from Volcanic
       Activity
   A8.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Insert the following statement in the comments section of the DD
   Form 1801 flight plan, ―Risk assessment for flight operations in forecast volcanic ash is on
   file with aircraft’s assigned unit.‖
A8.5. (Added-USAFE) Preflight Weather Assistance. Your AF weather flight will provide
appropriate ash forecast information with preflight weather briefings. Additionally, the 21 OWS
website (https://ows.sembach.af.mil) will post relevant links and information.
   A8.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Additional products based on the data from the responsible
   VAAC (e.g. London VAAC for any Iceland volcano) may be used for added situational
   awareness to include Air Force Weather Agency products (AFWA) that are based on VAAC
   analysis.
   A8.5.2. (Added-USAFE) If ―VA‖ (Volcanic Ash) is included in the METAR/TAF, the
   intent is to ensure aircrew reference the appropriate volcanic ash charts to determine
   operational constraints consistent with the guidance in this attachment. ―VA‖ in and of itself
   does not communicate an operational restriction.
A8.6. (Added-USAFE) Reporting.
   A8.6.1. (Added-USAFE) Whenever flight through Volcanic Activity occurs (either by
   flying through the area described in paragraph A8.2.1 (Added) or by encountering
   conditions as published in TO and/or AFI 11-2MDSV3 guidance, aircrew will report flight
   details (see below) as a Code 3 in the aircraft forms.
   A8.6.2. (Added-USAFE) Whenever flight through the VABZ occurs aircrew are to record
   flight details (see below) as an ―info-note‖ in the aircraft forms. The effects of long term low-
   concentration ash exposure will be analyzed based on the reported data; therefore, aircrew
   must ensure reporting is as accurate as possible.
   A8.6.3. (Added-USAFE) In all cases, report flight details in an Ops-maintained activity log
   (see paragraph A8.6.6 (Added)). Units will ensure the recorded information is made
   available to wing safety offices and archived for at least one year from the date of the flight.
 130                   AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


   A8.6.4. (Added-USAFE) Flight details to record:
       A8.6.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Approximate Location (Lat/Long if known, or general
       geolocation if Lat/Long not available).
       A8.6.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Time (zulu) and duration (to the nearest tenth, e.g. 1.4) in
       Volcanic Activity and/or the VABZ.
       A8.6.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Altitude, speed, type maneuvering (e.g. cruise, tactical, etc.)
   A8.6.5. (Added-USAFE) NLT 1500Z on the first Friday of the month (Thursday if Friday
   is a holiday), Wings will provide a roll-up (see paragraph A8.6.6 (Added)) of the previous
   month’s Volcanic Activity and VABZ flight details to the ―USAFE/A3TV (Workflow)‖
   organizational account (usafe.a3tv@ramstein.af.mil) with totals for the following (if no
   flights were logged, no report is needed):
       A8.6.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Flights in Volcanic Activity
       A8.6.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Average duration of exposure to Volcanic Activity
       A8.6.5.3. (Added-USAFE) Flights in the VABZ
       A8.6.5.4. (Added-USAFE) Average duration of exposure to the VABZ
   A8.6.6. (Added-USAFE) For unit recording of Volcanic Activity and VABZ flight
   operations as well as to submit the monthly roll-up, use the ―USAFE Volcano Flight Activity
   Log‖ under the ―Misc Information & Guidance‖ folder on the USAFE/A3TV ICE (link:
   https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/A3/A3T/A3TV_External/default.aspx)
A8.7. (Added-USAFE) Requesting Waivers. Submit waiver requests IAW paragraph 1.6.1.5
(Added) using the HQ USAFE/A3TV Volcanic Activity Waiver Template found under the
―Waivers‖ folder on the USAFE/A3TV ICE.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                               131


                                Attachment 9 (Added-USAFE)
           USAFE MODE S OPERATIONS AND ADDRESS MANAGEMENT

A9.1. (Added-USAFE) Purpose. This attachment outlines Mode S capabilities, address (both
default and dynamic) distribution and management, and usage by USAFE and USAFE-gained
aircraft. For more information on country-specific employment guidance and restrictions
reference the USAFE Mode S CoP (link: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/
home.aspx?Filter=OO-OP-FE-33)
A9.2. (USAFE) Basic Mode S Capabilities. A ―Default‖ address is assigned to each Mode S
transponder when it is installed in an aircraft. No two aircraft should ever have the same default
address.
   A9.2.1. (USAFE) . (Added) Mode S transponders in most military aircraft are equipped
   with the ability to accept a different address than the default to increase Operational Security
   (OPSEC). This address is called a dynamic address and as with the default address, no two
   aircraft should ever fly with the same address.
   A9.2.2. (Added-USAFE) The dynamic address does not overwrite the default since the
   default, in most case, is either hardwired into the Mode S transponder or exists in non-
   volatile memory. The dynamic address will simply override the default address until
   electrical power is removed from the aircraft.
   A9.2.3. (Added-USAFE) For most aircraft, once electrical power is reapplied, the default
   address will automatically be set into the transponder. Reference aircraft-specific TOs for
   details on individual system’s capabilities.
A9.3. (Added-USAFE) Threat Assessment.
   A9.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Mode S transponders currently do not have a military application;
   however, equipment necessary to interrogate Mode S transponders and consolidate the
   information received from Mode S interrogations is readily available.
   A9.3.2. (Added-USAFE) An adversary could match the default address to information
   about the aircraft, such as type, tail number, unit, and base, in a manner similar to that used to
   map internet sites to their locations and owners. With a database of default addresses, an
   adversary would be able to track movements of specific aircraft.
   A9.3.3. (Added-USAFE) Using the military-only capability of setting a dynamic address
   that cannot be tied to a particular aircraft may make it more difficult for adversaries to profile
   USAFE aircraft.
   A9.3.4. (Added-USAFE) Changing the address will have no effect on the ability to track
   aircraft using SSRs, air defense radar, or airborne platforms (through TCAS/ACAS) due to
   the unsecured transmission of Mode S data; however, changing codes may inhibit an
   adversary from developing a database of USAFE aircraft.
   A9.3.5. (Added-USAFE) Neither Mode S Addresses themselves nor an association of a
   Mode S address with a particular aircraft is classified; however, to aid in OPSEC, default and
   dynamic addresses assigned to each USAFE flying wing should be kept For Official Use
   Only (FOUO) as well as any documentation that lists them.
 132                   AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


A9.4. (Added-USAFE) Address Distribution and Management
   A9.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Default Address Assignment.
   A9.4.2. (Added-USAFE) The default address is assigned to a tail number by the SPO for
   that MDS and will stay with that aircraft as long as it is still under US registry. Should a
   Mode S transponder be removed from an aircraft, the default address would stay with the
   aircraft even if a new transponder is installed.
   A9.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Default Address Management.
       A9.4.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Aircraft Forms. The default address will be annotated in
       block 9 of the aircraft AFTO Form 781F, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Report and
       Maintenance (Front Cover), as follows: ―Aircraft Mode Select (S) Default Address:
       XXXXXXXX.‖
       A9.4.3.2. (Added-USAFE) MAF Only. The default address will be posted in the
       cockpit so as to be readily viewable by aircrew during flight (e.g. placarded next to
       aircraft tail number). This requirement may be met electronically if the default address
       can be viewed through the FMS.
   A9.4.4. (Added-USAFE) Dynamic Address Assignment. HQ USAFE/A3TV will be the
   OPR for dynamic address assignment. In order to ensure deconfliction of dynamic addresses,
   HQ USAFE/A3TV will maintain a database of which dynamic addresses are
   assigned/available for each USAFE flying wing.
       A9.4.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Dynamic address usage is mandatory for CAF units,
       optional for MAF. MAF units desiring to use dynamic addressing will notify A3TV
       through their respective OGVs.
       A9.4.4.2. (Added-USAFE) USAFE/A3TV will distribute a number of addresses equal
       to twice the number of PAA at each participating wing.
       A9.4.4.3. (Added-USAFE) Those flying wings that desire more addresses than twice
       their PAA will request the specific number from USAFE/A3TV.
   A9.4.5. (Added-USAFE) Dynamic Address Management (N/A for units not employing
   dynamic addressing). Management of dynamic addresses at the unit level will be IAW the
   following guidance with the overriding objective that no two aircraft should EVER fly with
   the same address.
       A9.4.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Each unit is responsible for distributing their HQ USAFE-
       assigned block of dynamic addresses to their respective squadrons. Once the unit
       distributes the dynamic addresses, squadrons will not share addresses except when same-
       MDS squadrons are conducting combined operations, then only the host squadron’s
       dynamic addresses will be used.
       A9.4.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Dynamic addresses will be associated with the maintenance
       line numbers on the daily schedule.
          A9.4.5.2.1. (Added-USAFE) Squadron flying supervision is responsible for
          tracking the dynamic addresses that have been assigned to each line number.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                          133


        A9.4.5.2.2. (Added-USAFE) Squadrons will distribute the dynamic addresses to
        aircrew NLT when the aircrew step to their assigned aircraft (CAF: NLT the step
        brief).
        A9.4.5.2.3. (Added-USAFE) Dynamic addresses will not be flown on the same
        aircraft twice in one day (Exception: Hot Pitting, engine(s) running on the ground
        between flights, or multiple legs of a continuous mission).
        A9.4.5.2.4. (Added-USAFE) Once aircrew have stepped to their aircraft, they will
        retain their assigned dynamic address until the mission is complete or canceled.
        A9.4.5.2.5. (Added-USAFE) If an aircraft must divert and land at other than the
        planned destination (i.e. home station for local training sorties), aircrew will cease
        using dynamic addressing once at the divert filed and use ONLY the default address
        for any other flights needed to return the aircraft to home station.
     A9.4.5.3. (Added-USAFE) Units will ―shift‖ dynamic addresses at least once every
     quarter on the first flying day of the month starting with Jan (i.e. 1 Jan, 1 Apr, 1 Jul, 1
     Oct) by moving the last dynamic address to the top of the list and all subsequent
     addresses down one line.
     A9.4.5.4. (Added-USAFE) For continuous off-station training sorties (i.e. non-
     contingency deployments/cross-countries), flying supervision for the deployment/cross-
     country will take twice as many dynamic addresses as the number of jets flown. Except
     for ensuring that both home station and deployed dynamic addresses are fully
     deconflicted and tracked, off-station dynamic address management is the same as home-
     station.
     A9.4.5.5. (Added-USAFE) If there is any confusion over the correct dynamic address
     to use or whether or not aircrew are authorized to use a dynamic address, aircrew will
     consult with squadron flying supervision or resort to using the default address.
     A9.4.5.6. (Added-USAFE) Aircrew will refrain from transmitting dynamic addresses
     over a non-secure radio and at no time will associate a dynamic address with a tail
     number or aircraft call-sign.
A9.5. (Added-USAFE) Mode S Usage.
  A9.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Flight Plans. Use the following guidance when preparing 1801s
  or using stereo flight plans for flights within the USAFE AOR.
     A9.5.1.1. (Added-USAFE) DD Forms 1801 must be filled out correctly to reflect both
     Mode S capability (e.g. ―/S‖ in block 10) and a correct Aircraft ID. See Appendix A, GP
     Chapter 4, and AP/2 for more information.
     A9.5.1.2. (Added-USAFE) Airfield management personnel should ensure that stereo
     flight plans currently in use by USAFE flying wings are entered into the ATC system
     correctly with respect to Mode S capability and callsign.
     A9.5.1.3. (Added-USAFE) The DD Form 1801 aircraft identification (block 7) MUST
     match what the Flight/Aircraft ID entered into the Mode S transponder.
  A9.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Flight ID Entry. Use the following rules when entering Flight
  IDs into the Mode S transponder.
134                    AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012


      A9.5.2.1. (Added-USAFE) The first digit is always the first letter of the callsign.
      A9.5.2.2. (Added-USAFE) No spaces, dashes or special characters should be in
      between digits.
      A9.5.2.3. (Added-USAFE) If the callsign is not a complete 7-digits, then leave spaces
      at the end (i.e. SPAR11_, not SPAR_11).
  A9.5.3. (Added-USAFE) Default/Dynamic Address Entry. Use the following guidance
  when inputting the Mode S address into the Mode S transponder.
      A9.5.3.1. (Added-USAFE) Enter either the default or dynamic address into the Mode S
      transponder IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, and TO guidance.
      A9.5.3.2. (Added-USAFE) Regardless of the aircraft, in order to maximize OPSEC,
      ensure the Mode S transponder is OFF prior to address entry. This will minimize any
      attempt to correlate the address with a specific aircraft.
      A9.5.3.3. (Added-USAFE) Loss of power via generator failure, power interruption, or
      upon turning the equipment off may cause the loss of the dynamic address and automatic
      reversion to and subsequent transmission of the default address. It is imperative aircrew
      check their Mode S transponders after a loss of power to be aware of which address and
      Flight/Aircraft ID is being transmitted.
  A9.5.4. (Added-USAFE) Peacetime/Non-Contingency.
      A9.5.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Default or dynamic addresses assigned by USAFE units
      will be used anytime the aircraft is flying under USAFE OPCON anywhere in the world.
      A9.5.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Mode S will be ON/selected for all missions utilizing either
      the default or dynamic address. At a minimum, Mode S will be on from takeoff through
      landing, but may also be on during ground operations.
      A9.5.4.2.1. (Added-USAFE) To the maximum extent practical (mandatory for all home
      station sorties), all USAFE aircraft will perform a Mode S ground check with the first
      available agency that can confirm the proper Flight ID is being received (N/A for those
      locations that do not possess a Mode S-capable radar).
      A9.5.4.3. (Added-USAFE) MAF. Reference AFI 11-2MDSV3, local, and TO guidance
      for Mode S usage guidance during flight. At a minimum, be prepared to have Mode S
      ON/selected whenever actively squawking Mode 3/A/C or when the aircrew would
      normally squawk Mode 3/A/C even if no Mode 3/A/C code is issued.
      A9.5.4.4. (Added-USAFE) CAF. Regardless of the following guidance, turn Mode S
      ON/OFF if specifically requested by ATC.
         A9.5.4.4.1. (Added-USAFE) Members within a formation will squawk Mode S
         anytime when actively squawking Mode 3/A/C or when the aircrew would normally
         squawk Mode 3/A/C even if no Mode 3/A/C code is issued. NOTE: Some ATC
         radar systems within Europe may transition to Mode S-only interrogators, therefore,
         a traditional Mode 3/A/C code may or may not be issued, but aircrew are still
         expected to have Mode S ON/selected. If in doubt, keep Mode S ON/selected
         unless/until the ATC controllers asks for it to be “strangled”.
AFI11-202V3_USAFESUP_AVIANOABSUP_I 11 OCTOBER 2012                                         135


         A9.5.4.4.2. (Added-USAFE) Do not use Mode S during CORONET movements
         (i.e. deployments and redeployments) or anytime while formating with a tanker.
         A9.5.4.4.3. (Added-USAFE) DO NOT change the Mode S address while airborne.
         If after airborne it is determined that an incorrect address has been entered into the
         transponder shut off the Mode S transponder and troubleshoot once back on the
         ground (do NOT try to troubleshoot a Mode S transponder in the air).
  A9.5.5. (Added-USAFE) Contingency Airspace.
     A9.5.5.1. (Added-USAFE) Until incorporated into SPINS/ROE, ensure Mode S is
     turned OFF/deselected by any means available while in contingency airspace.
     A9.5.5.2. (Added-USAFE) Once Mode S is incorporated into SPINS/ROE, address
     management and usage will be through the ATO in conjunction with other IFF codes.
  A9.5.6. (Added-USAFE) Change of Operational Control (CHOP). USAFE aircraft
  CHOPed to another MAJCOM may use dynamic addresses issued by that MAJCOM as long
  as the gaining MAJCOM has procedures in-place to ensure dynamic address deconfliction. In
  the event of confusion regarding address assignment, USAFE aircraft will revert to using
  their default address, if practical, until the situation is resolved.
