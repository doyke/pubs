Introduction _____________________________________________i

        Volume 5, Patient Administration, Qualification Training Package (QTP)
contains modules on verifying patient eligibility, the initiation of dental health
records, preparing medical consultations, charting records, identifying types of exams
and dental readiness classifications, and managing the movement of records. This
volume is designed to enhance 5-, and 7-skill level OJT of dental assistant personnel.
The eight volumes are intended to be used by trainees, trainers, supervisors, and task
certifiers. Before initiating any training you should review your responsibilities--as a
supervisor/trainer--for conducting on-the-job training (OJT) per AFI 36-2201, Air
Force Training Program.

        QTPs are designed to help you conduct and evaluate your field training. Once
you begin upgrade training you’re required to use the QTPs. QTPs provide
continuity to the trainee’s upgrade training and are divided into the following
volumes: 1) Basic Skills; 2) Clinical Skills - Radiology; 3) Clinical Skills - Chairside
Assisting; 4) Clinical Skills - Preventive Dentistry; 5) Patient Administration –
Procedures and Programs; 6) Logistics Management; 7) Clinic Management, and 8)
Supervision and Training. The QTP modules were written to assist you in preparing
for and conducting training. You must use the QTP modules for training when either:
1) the STS task is a core task (minimum qualification for the specialty); or 2) you
have identified the STS task as a requirement of the trainee’s job. Each module
segments the major tasks into teachable elements. Your goal is to provide enough
training and guidance so trainees can do all task related steps, without assistance,
while meeting local requirements for speed and accuracy. QTPs also aid OJT task
certifiers in evaluating the trainee’s demonstrated performance. If you have local
training requirements not covered by a QTP module you should develop “steps in
performance” and “performance checklists” that support and standardize those tasks.

        Accompanying each volume of QTPs is a qualification training progress
record. This QTP record serves as a document to record the date the trainee
completes each module. Individuals in qualification/upgrade training must have this
QTP progress record filed in their OJT folder. Use and annotation of this progress
record are similar to current OJT documentation. When you are satisfied the trainee
meets standards, as prescribed in the QTP performance checklist, you must document
and initial each task completion date in column 2B of the Specialty Training Standard
(STS) and the “date completed” column in the QTP progress record. If a person is
being recertified on a task that is supported by a QTP you must use that module to
complete the recertification process.

        Typically, you will manage each module by first, training the tasks and then,
evaluating performance. Your local steps in performance may vary from the method
listed in the QTP module. If this is the case, you are authorized to make changes to
the first half of each module, (i.e., steps in task performance); however, the
“performance checklist” is considered a standard and cannot be altered. You may
Introduction _____________________________________________ii

train each QTP volume/module in any sequence; however, when conducting training
use an organized and methodical approach. This will reduce your training time and
enhance your efforts.

        When beginning any training process you should first, review the procedures
in each module with the trainee. Second, direct the trainee to review the training
references listed to prepare for task performance. Third, go through the steps in task
performance with the trainee, allowing enough time to adequately train each step
(some modules may take longer to teach). Fourth, evaluate the trainee’s work at each
critical step--using the performance checklist at this point will be helpful. Fifth,
evaluate the trainee’s performance and provide feedback on any areas for
improvement. Finally, when the trainee has successfully completed the task you must
document and initial both the STS and the QTP progress record. If the trainee does
not accomplish the module, conduct follow-up instruction until the trainee
successfully completes the task.

        The QTP project goal of the 381 TRS/XWAA, Sheppard AFB TX, is to
publish a useable document for trainers and trainees. You are encouraged to write-in
changes or revisions to the QTPs. A corrections/improvements letter is located on the
last page of each QTP volume.

        The inclusion of names of any specific commercial product, commodity, or
service in this publication is for informational purposes only and does not imply
endorsement by the Air Force.

          toward the left, and then from mandibular left to the right
     c. Code 0: No calculus or defective margins are detected, gingival tissue is healthy and no
          bleeding is present after probing
