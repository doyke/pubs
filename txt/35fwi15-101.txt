SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised, reformatted and must be completely reviewed.
Major changes to the previous Weather Support Document (WSD) of 2009 has been made to the
entire document. Erroneous and extra information from the previous document have been
deleted. A revised AFMAN 15-129V1/V2 was published in December 2011, which has required
additions, exclusions and modifications to this document. ―Severe/Moderate Thunderstorms,‖
―Damaging/Strong Winds,‖ and ―Damaging/Large Hail‖ have been added to the weather watches
and warnings tables. The Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP) has been modified and is
reflected in this document. The Joint Army and Air Force Weather Information Network
(JAAWIN) is currently undergoing a transition to the AF-WEBS system and will soon be phased
out. Customers will not be substantially affected when this occurs but all JAAWIN referenced
products will become AF-WEBS in the near future.

                                          Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. The 35 Operations Support Squadron (OSS/OSW) Weather Flight (WF) provides
and/or arranges weather services to the 35 Fighter Wing (FW) and other units assigned to
Misawa AB, Japan. Basic concepts and procedures are outlined in Air Force and Pacific Air
Forces directives. This document establishes requirements and procedures for areas of weather
support that must be coordinated at the local level to meet mission needs. It consolidates
weather support requirements and procedures for peacetime operations and eliminates the need
for written agreements between the weather unit and supported organizations. It does not cover
weather support for emergency war operations (EWO), since this is covered in the applicable
United States Forces Japan, 5th Air Force (5 AF), and 35 FW OPLANs.
1.2. Background.
   1.2.1. The 35 OSS/OSW, Weather Flight (WF), which is also known as exploitation unit
   (EU) performs three (3) main functions: staff, airfield, and mission; to maintain efficiency
   and effectiveness of the Misawa Air Base mission.
   1.2.2. The 17th Operational Weather Squadron (OWS), Misawa Air Base’s collaboration
   unit (CU), located at Joint Base Pearl Harbor – Hickam, HI will provide regional and
   operational level products and information to Air Force and Army units in the Pacific Theater
   overseas and the continental United States (CONUS), to include Misawa Air Base, Japan.
   1.2.3. The Japan Air Self Defense Force (JASDF), weather squadron, located on Misawa
       Air Base, Japan will provide the official terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF) and hourly
   observations for the airfield (Ref. MOUI 3005). Details on criteria and dissemination times
   will be defined in section 1.3.3.1.
1.3. Responsibilities
   1.3.1. The 35 OSS/OSW implements their responsibilities under three (3) main elements:
       1.3.1.1. Staff Integration Function provides direct interface to the 35 FW Commanders
       and their staff. 35 OSS/OSW assists in the development of weather support plans and
       processes for the 35 FW and associated units. The WF will support Misawa Air Base in
       providing products and/or weather related information required by regulations or as
       directed by the 35 FW/CC.
       1.3.1.2. Airfield Support Function provides resource protection, meteorological watch
       and are the ―eyes forward‖ for the 17 OWS. The WF has the role as OWS backup,
       issuing, amending, and canceling forecasted and observed WWAs. The WF is
       responsible to provide mission impacting weather information to the 35 FW if operations
       occur away from main operating locations.
       1.3.1.3. Mission Integration Function provides support to the WF customers and
       transient aircrew through Mission Execution Forecasts (MEF) or similar means. The WF
       is responsible for mission/event planning briefs for the 35 FW mission. Briefings outside
       of the routine briefings can be requested through this function.
 8                                                                35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012


     1.3.2. 17th Operational Weather Squadron (OWS).
        1.3.2.1. Using AFI 15-128, Aerospace Weather Operations- Roles and Responsibilities
        (February 2011), the OWS will provide resource protection, regional and operational-
        level weather products and information, meteorological watch (METWATCH), and flight
        weather briefings support.
        1.3.2.2. The Installation Data Plan (IDP) between the 35 OSS/OSW and 17 OWS
        provides specific responsibilities concerning the two agencies. 17 OWS will issue all
        forecasted watches, warnings, and advisories (WWA). When the WF is closed, they will
        assume responsibility for issuing observed WWAs referenced on Table 8.2 (Lightning)
        and Table 8.3 with superscript ―¹.‖ Flight weather briefings will also be provided by the
        17 OWS when the WF cannot support transient aircrew.
     1.3.3. Japan Air Self Defense Force (JASDF)
        1.3.3.1. The Japan Air Self Defense Force will provide the official forecast for Misawa
        Air Base. They will also disseminate the hourly observations with forecasts at the end of
        each observation. The JASDF TAF and Observations are only available from the
        Weather Communication system (WECOM) and ―.mil‖ weather related websites.
        Specifications are listed below:
            1.3.3.1.1. The JASDF forecaster issues a TAF every 12 hours (2300Z/0800L and
            1100Z/2000L), each covering a 24- hour period.
            1.3.3.1.2. The JASDF Weather Squadron issues a 6-hour forecast every hour from
            0600-2100L; a 6-hour forecast every 3 hours from 2100-0600L; and a 9-hour forecast
            at 0700L in the body of the observation during the above times.
            1.3.3.1.3. JASDF forecasters will not amend the TAF; updates to the TAF will be
            shown in the hourly observations.
        1.3.3.2. To request access to the TAF and Observations through the appropriate ―.mil‖
        websites, contact the WF at DSN 315-226-3065/4930 on how to do so.
        1.3.3.3. The WECOM system and JASDF Radar are direct feeds from their weather
        office in building 998. The WF does not have any responsibility or capability to maintain
        these systems. Due to the importance of both systems, the WECOM specifically, is a
        must fund item.
1.4. Duty Priorities. In order to ensure high priority duties are accomplished during periods of
increased operations tempo, the 17 OWS duty priorities are listed in Table 1.1 and the WF duty
priorities are listed in Table 1.2.
 35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012                                                                 9

1.5. Operational Hours. Misawa WF normal hours are from 0700L to 1700L Monday through
Friday with exceptions of PACAF family days, federal holidays, and non-flying days. If the
Fighter Wing flies prior to the published hours, WF will be manned at least 3 hours prior to the
first pilot brief annotated on the daily flying schedule until 30 minutes after the last sortie lands
or the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) returns from the Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower. During
closed hours, WF personnel will be on standby. A monthly standby roster will be provided to
the Misawa Command Post and 17 OWS NLT the 28th of the prior month. If weather support is
required, contact the stand-by forecaster directly or through the command post. If the duty
forecaster cannot be reached, contact the Flt/CC or NCOIC of the 35 OSS/OSW.
1.6. Assumptions, Shortfalls, and Limitations.
   1.6.1. WF Assumptions. Weather support can only be provided if appropriate facilities,
   funding, communications, personnel, and indigenous support (e.g. power, water, etc.) are
   available.
   1.6.2. 17 OWS Assumptions. Adequate resources and communications will be available to
   execute the military operating areas (MOA) and/or assigned data sheets and sufficient
   weather intelligence will be available from various sources on which to base weather
   operations and production.
   1.6.3. WF Shortfalls. Some services may not always be available (out-of-station briefings)
   due to WF manning, station evacuation, or other higher priority missions.
   1.6.4. WF Limitations.
       1.6.4.1. The Weather Flight receives the official TAF and observation from the JASDF
       Weather Squadron. Minor deviations from this forecast will be decided upon the greater
       judgments of the forecaster on duty.
1.6.4.1.1. The WF does not have the capability to request the JASDF Weather Squadron to take
a special observation. The SOF will request a special to be taken through the tower
superintendant and then he or she will ask the weather squadron to take another observation.
       1.6.4.2. Short notice requests for routine weather services must be minimized. Pre-
       coordination for weather services is a major factor in allowing weather flight leadership
       to de-conflict and prioritize requests based on available resources and duty priorities.
       Requests for weather support outside of the weather flight’s operational chain of
       command will be routed through OSS leadership. Requests for weather support that the
       weather flight cannot provide or arrange are routed through OSS leadership for a
       support/do not supports decision.
       1.6.4.3. Due to the unpredictability of weather events, forecasts beyond 24 hours will be
       used for planning purposes only.
1.7. Alternate Operating Location (AOL).
   1.7.1. Weather flight will re-locate to the 35 OG, building 918, room 32 in the event of a
   building evacuation. The alternate location phone number is DSN 315-226-7380. For real-
   world mission reasons, the WF will not evacuate during exercises. The flight will continue
   operational FW support and the WF’s ―eyes forward‖ responsibilities for the 17 OWS. Most
   WF services and support will be provided, but will require a case-by-case assessment
   dependent on communication line status, equipment status, limited SIPR availability, etc.
35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012                                                                     11


   Expect most services to be somewhat degraded (weather products, pilot briefings, etc) due to
   limited facilities and of dedicated data services, including sensors and various data types
   (METSAT, radar imagery, etc.). The WECOM will not be available at the AOL.
1.8. Release of Weather Information to Non-DoD Agencies and Individuals. Release of
weather information to non-DoD organizations will not be provided unless authorized by Air
Force Instructions or 35 FW/CC (or designated representative). In addition, no Misawa AB or
35 FW agencies will release weather data to outside agencies unless first coordinated with 35
OSS/OSW.
1.9. Post – Mission Analysis / Feedback. Per AFMAN 15-129, Volume 2, Chapter 2, units
that regularly utilize weather support from the WF should provide post-mission/utilization
feedback, when possible. This information will be used to ensure products delivered to flying
customers are accurate, relevant, and timely.
   1.9.1. Formal/informal feedback methods include:
       1.9.1.1. Completing a feedback form located outside the weather station door and
       dropping it off at the forecaster counter.
   1.9.1.2. Calling the forecaster counter at 315-226-3065/4930.
       1.9.1.3. Email and/or phone calls to the Flight/CC or NCOIC.
       1.9.1.4. Face to face feedback after any briefing.
       1.9.1.5. 35 OSS/OSW webpage under ―Flying Support,‖ ―Pilot/SOF Feedback‖
       (\\mifs002\OSS_OSW\OSW\index.htm)
   1.9.2. The WF will, in turn, utilize this data to refine their mission support role and gauge
   unit strength and weaknesses.
1.10. Mishap Procedures. Misawa WF and the 17 OWS have a role when the airfield is
advised of an emergency or mishap. The WF will ensure applicable data is used in the
development of any weather product, and/or service provided is saved for an investigation (to
include MEFs, space weather products, etc.). The WF and 17 OWS will save enough data before
and after the mishap to fully reconstruct the environmental conditions. The WF will coordinate
with 17 OWS at DSN 315-449-8336.

                             AIRFIELD SUPPORT FUNCTION

3.1. General. Airfield Support include those actions that affect the Misawa aerodrome (defined
within 5 miles of the airfield). Examples include severe weather actions, OWS backup, PMSV,
and resource protection. Severe weather actions and resource protection are addressed in depth
in Chapter 8.
3.2. Operational Hours. Airfield Support are normally provided Monday-Friday (0700L-
1700L/2200Z-0800Z) and standby support through the weekend, federal holidays, and PACAF
down days. Airfield Support hours may be extended based on the 35 FW flying hours. Weather
personnel performing these services can be contacted at DSN 315-226-3065/4930. A standby
person is available during periods of time when the weather stations is closed and can be
contacted via Command Post, DSN 315-226-9899.
3.3. Observations. Per the MOUI-3005, observations are taken by the Japan Air-Self Defense
Force, Weather Squadron forecasters and disseminated via the Weather Communication System
(WECOM). The 35 OSS WF may provide limited, local weather updates/information solely for
35 FW flying operations using the FMQ-19/GMQ-14 observation systems.
   3.3.1. Observing Site. The JASDF's official point of observation on Misawa AB is the
   JASDF observation tower adjacent to Bldg 998.
   3.3.2. Observation Site Limitations. The following limitation affects surface observation
   quality:
       3.3.2.1. Lightning near the observation point reduces the observer’s visibility at night.
   3.3.3. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). JASDF conducts a basic weather watch in accordance
   with Attachment 2.
   3.3.4. LOCAL Observation. A LOCAL observation is taken for criteria established locally
   where worldwide dissemination is not required.
   3.3.5. Special Observation (SPECI). The JASDF take a special (SPECI) observation when
   observed weather criteria pass through significant weather thresholds established by JASDF
   Guidance 98-11. SPECI is disseminated worldwide using the Global Telecommunications
   System (GTS) and is automatically ingested into the Automated Weather Network (AWN).
   3.3.6. JASDF Weather Observing Criteria. Refer to Attachment 2 for specification criteria.
35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012                                                                      15

3.4. Cooperative Weather Watch. A traditional cooperative weather watch is not in force
between the JASDF ATC facility and the JASDF weather squadron due to the JASDF separation
of duties between their personnel and MOUI 3005; however, a non-traditional cooperative
weather watch is observed. Rather than cooperatively observing with an ATC facility, JASDF
weather personnel are permanently situated within a tower of equal height and approximate
location. Additionally, through the JASDF WECOM system all observations, to include Locals
and non-longline SPECIs are immediately displayed within the WF. Finally, JASDF ATC will
transmit pertinent weather warnings and advisories and weather alternate information on the
ATIS (as directed by MOUI 3005). The JASDF SQ will pass the warnings and advisories to
ATC. In addition, the SOF will forward the USAF weather watches, warnings, and advisories to
the 35 FW aircrews.
3.5. Alternate Observing Sites. The JASDF weather squadron utilizes the Base Defense
Weather Flight as an alternate observing site/team. Observations taken at the alternate site will
be pushed via the WECOM System.
3.6. Eyes Forward. WF technicians will relay significant, time-sensitive meteorological
information to the forecasters conducting resource protection and METWATCH operations at
 16                                                               35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012


the 17 OWS. ―Eyes Forward‖ provides an organized approach for weather personnel to maintain
situational awareness of the current and future meteorological situation within a designated area.
3.7. PMSV Support. Weather information is available during 35 FW flying hours on frequency
344.6 MHz. The duty weather technician will monitor PMSV traffic during normal operations
for all aircraft contacts. Phone patches are available on 226-3065.
   3.7.1. Pilot Weather Reports (PIREPs) provide forecaster with crucial weather information
   required to ensure accurate forecast products and safety of flight. All supported flying
   squadron commanders should maintain an active PIREP program and pass pertinent
       information to weather personnel as soon as possible via the PMSV, SOF, or Mission
   Integration Function forecaster. Pilots should relay any weather encountered which may
   jeopardize flight safety.
   3.7.2. Weather personnel will disseminate PIREPs to the SOF, TOP 3 and JASDF following
   local procedures. All urgent PIREPs will be disseminated locally and longline.
   3.7.3. PMSV Outages. When the PMSV is logged out/not usable, the Yokota Weather
   Flight will monitor PMSV calls directed at Misawa. If the outage is longer than 6 hours, the
   Tower will list us on the Automated Terminal information System (ATIS) as unavailable.
   We will be available through the Command Post as a phone patch. The WF will notify
   Airfield Management to issue a NOTAM when the outage exceeds 6 hours.
   3.7.4. A daily radio check with Command Post is executed to ensure proper PMSV
   functionality.
3.8. Weather Sensors. The FMQ-19 is available for real-time data retrieval. The JASDF
GMQ-14 is also used for real-time sensor data.
3.9. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF). The Misawa Air Base TAF will be produced and
disseminated by the JASDF Weather Squadron, IAW with MOUI 3005. The TAF is valid for 24
hours and will be issued 2300Z (0800L) and 1100Z (2000L).
3.10. Resource Protection. Specific details for RP are covered in Chapter 8.
3.11. Climatological Services. The WF will provide a monthly climatology summary for
Misawa AB via the internet, fax, or email. The summary will include at a minimum:
   3.11.1. Monthly maximum, mean, and minimum ambient air temperatures
   3.11.2. Daily, monthly, annual rainfall and snowfall totals
   3.11.3. Daily ambient air temperatures
   3.11.4. Daily peak wind and direction
   3.11.5. Monthly maximum 24-hour rainfall and snowfall total

                           MISSION INTEGRATION FUNCTION

4.1. General. Mission services are those actions directly related to completing each customer’s
daily mission requirements (e.g. MEF, DD Form 175-1, etc.). The Mission Execution Forecast
(MEF) is the primary tool used to accomplish these tasks. MEFs are tailored to individual
customer requirements and may include: a DD Form 175-1, Operational Readiness Exercise
MEF, or a Misawa Air Festival weather forecast.
4.2. Operational Hours. Mission services are provided Monday-Friday (0700L-1700L / 2200Z
0800Z). Mission Service hours may be extended based on the 35 FW flying hours.
4.3. Mission Execution Forecast (MEF). MEFs are essentially mission-specific forecasts that
are developed using a two-part (Operational and Administrative), four-step process and may be
provided by a number of methods (web-based, verbally, share drive, etc.). The Administrative
MEF is located on Attachment 3 and the Operational MEF is located in the WF local SOPs.
During this process, the WF will fuse and tailor products created by strategic and theater weather
centers, as well as information supplied by local units (e.g. flying schedule) and agencies. The
result is a product and information designed to provide timely, accurate, and relevant weather
intelligence to the customer by whatever means proves most effective. MEFs must be
horizontally consistent with (but not necessarily mirror) products issued by JASDF, 17 OWS,
and AFWA. However, during rapidly changing conditions, emergencies, or when conditions
threaten resource protection, the WF will amend the MEF to accurately reflect conditions and
back brief the SOF and 17 OWS when time permits.
   4.3.1. The SOFMEF will be posted 1.5 hours prior to the first take-off and the Mass Brief
   will be available an hour prior to the brief time.
   4.3.2. Misawa AB (RJSM) weather data on top (refer to Figure 4.1): This data includes the
   weather conditions for the duration of the specific mission being executed. The crosswinds
   portion will turn red when it is 25 knots or greater.
   4.3.3. Hazards (refer to Figure 4.1): This will cover at least a 100 mile radius of the airfield
   and/or the locations of which the aircrews will be flying throughout the duration of their
   mission. If more detail is needed, graphics will be added below the satellite image.
   4.3.4. Airspace forecasts (refer to Figure 4.1): Locations Charlie, Draughon Range, Gaicho,
   and Bravo will be forecasted on a daily basis and occasionally Alpha. Due to the large area
   of each section, forecasts will occasionally be broken into the cardinal directions to better
   indicate the weather phenomenon. The clouds will be provided as a thickness layer with
   occasional variances in FEW, SCT, BKN, or OVC (i.e. 020 BKN V OVC 100). Winds,
   waves, and sea surface temperatures are coded with specific colors when different thresholds
   are crossed.
       4.3.4.1. Sea surface temperatures: When temperatures are less than 60F, the box will be
       shaded light blue to indicate an unfavorable threshold has been crossed.
       4.3.4.2. Waves: Colors will change from Green (0-5ft), to Yellow (5.1-10ft), to Red
       (+10.1ft) depending on the thresholds the wave heights cross.
18                                                               35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012


     4.3.4.3. Wind Speed: Any wind speed that is less than or equal to 25 knots will be coded
     Green. Any wind speed great than or equal to 26 knots will be coded Red.
     4.3.4.4. These parameters are found on the METCAST program provided by the Navy.
     Any additional information may be gathered from the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and
     Oceanography Center (FNMOC) webpage or local products provided by the Naval
     Oceanography ASW Detachment, Misawa.
  4.3.5. Alternate/Divert Airfields include the TAFs/forecast weather conditions for suitable
  airfields in the local training area if take-off or destination weather for RJSM are below F-16
  minimums.
     4.3.5.1. The following alternates are used during routine MEFs unless otherwise
     specified.
         4.3.5.1.1. Hachinohe (RJSH)
         4.3.5.1.2. Chitose (RJCJ)
         4.3.5.1.3. Matsushima (RJST)
         4.3.5.1.4. Yokota (RJTY)
         4.3.5.1.5. Hakodate (RJCH)
         4.3.5.1.6. Aomori (RJSA)
     4.3.5.2. The ―Time‖ column will be highlighted:
         4.3.5.2.1. Green: Alternate weather is greater than or equal to 2000FT/3SM.
         4.3.5.2.2. Yellow: Alternate weather is less than 2000FT/3SM to 1000FT/2SM.
         4.3.5.2.3. Red: less 1000FT/2SM and/or crosswinds greater than or equal to 20 knots.
35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012                                                                       19

NOTE: This document is tailored to the customer’s needs and can be altered at any time.
   4.3.6. Space Weather products are gathered from the Joint Army and Air Force Weather
   Information Network (JAAWIN) see Chapter 6 for details.
      4.3.6.1. JAAWIN is currently undergoing a transition to the AF-WEBS system.
      Customers will not be substantially affected and information will continue to be
      disseminated properly.
   4.3.7. Follow-Up Support. Aircrews are welcome and encouraged to contact the WF for any
   post-mission information and/or follow-up support. Feedback information is available in
   Chapter 1, section 1.9.
   4.3.8. Transient Aircraft Weather Briefings. Weather personnel will provide verbal briefings
   and/or Flight Weather Briefings (DD 175-1) to aircrews as requested following the flight’s
   duty priority listed in Table 1.1. Transient briefings will be at the weather flight counter or
 20                                                               35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012


   via fax, phone, or email during normal duty hours (see Chapter 1, section 1.5). Transient
   aircrews will need to contact the 17 OWS during off duty hours and can be reached at 315-
   449-8335/7973/7950, the numbers to contact are also located on the WF entrance door.
   4.3.9. During special deployments, such as an Aviation Training Relocation (ATR),
   forecasters will continue to provide the 13 and/or 14 FS with the same MEF product.
   4.3.10. MEF Specification/Amendment Criteria can be found in Attachment11
4.4. Mass Brief
   4.4.1. The Mass Brief powerpoints will consist of satellite/radar, hazards, take-off weather
   data, operations areas, alternates, METCAST wave heights/ sea surface temperatures, and
   NVG data as required (See Attachment 4).
       4.4.1.1. Mass Briefs are tailored to what the customers (13/14 FS) have requested, this
       could change at any time (see Attachment 4).
       4.4.1.2. Once a SOFMEF is completed, a Mass brief will be produced. This will be
       posted on SIPRNET and WF webpage via NIPRNET. If there is a SIPRNET
       communication failure, the mass brief will be available via NIPRNET only.
4.5. MISSIONWATCH. Used to describe the process of how the WF monitors the weather for
all missions. All on-site meteorological and commercial data sources may be used to accomplish
this task and is the primary responsibility of the duty forecaster. It is through this method that
MEF amendments or updates are accomplished. During rapidly changing weather, the WF will
amend/update MEFs anytime MEF amendment criteria are met, or at any time deemed necessary
to ensure flight safety. For example, MEFs will be amended whenever a warning or advisory is
issued. WF will contact the SOF to pass on critical changes to applicable aircrews.
   4.5.1. Operational Risk Management (ORM). This six-step process (See Table 4.1 and
   Figure 4.2) will be used to determine the best course of action for any given situation by
   identifying the risks and benefits of the specific situation.
35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012                                                                       21



Table 4.1. Six-Step Process of Operational Risk Management
                 Identify the Hazard. A hazard can be defined as any real or potential
                 condition that can cause mission degradation, injury, illness, death to
                 personnel or damage to or loss of equipment or property. Experience,
    Step 1       common sense, and specific risk management tools help identify real or
                 potential hazards.
                 Assess the Risk. Risk is the probability and severity of loss from exposure to
                 the hazard. The assessment step is the application of quantitative or
                 qualitative measures to determine the level of risk associated with a specific
                 hazard. This process defines the probability and severity of a mishap that
    Step 2       could result from the hazard based upon the exposure of personnel or assets
                 to that hazard.
                 Analyze Risk Control Measures. Investigate specific strategies and tools
                 that reduce, mitigate, or eliminate the risk. Effective control measures reduce
                 or eliminate one of the three components (probability, severity, or exposure)
    Step 3       of risk.
                 Make Control Decisions. Decision-makers at the appropriate level choose
                 the best control or combination of controls based on the analysis of overall
    Step 4       costs and benefits.
                 Implement Risk Controls. Once control strategies have been selected, an
                 implementation strategy needs to be developed and then applied by
    Step 5       management and the work force. Implementation requires commitment of
                 time and resources.
                 Supervise and Review. Risk management is a process that continues
                 throughout the life cycle of the system, mission, or activity. Leaders at every
                 level must fulfill their respective roles in assuring controls are sustained over
                 time. Once controls are in place, the process must be periodically reevaluated
    Step 6       to ensure their effectiveness.
 22                                                            35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012


Figure 4.2. ORM MISSIONWATCH Process




4.6. Dissemination of Weather Products.
   4.6.1. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). JET is the first dissemination method used by the
   WF. Dependent on the setup of the system, JET will display current observations and
   watches, warnings, and advisories. Audible alerts are provided to key Misawa customers of
   weather that might impact operations. Key customers must maintain a continuous
   connection during operating hours and acknowledge receipt via the JET system.
   4.6.2. Weather Web Page. The WF maintains a robust set of web pages on the shared drive.
   The current address is: \\mifs002\oss_osw\OSW\index.htm. The location may change
   without notice due to 35 CS requirements. Customized pages can be provided for certain
   Misawa customers. Users requiring tailored weather data presentations may request the WF
   to customize a web page to meet their routine data needs.
   4.6.3. Misawa Weather Channel. The Weather Channel is channel 19 on the Misawa cable
   television system. Daily 5-day forecasts and climatology are routinely available. During a
   severe weather event, additional information concerning weather notices may be posted,
   including start and end times, and amount expected. Command and Control instructions
   pertaining to a given weather event may be found on the Commander’s Access Channel.
   This information will be posted as time and equipment allows.
35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012                                                                       23

                            STAFF INTEGRATION FUNCTION

5.1. General. Staff services are those briefings provided primarily by WF leadership. These
briefings are a specialized type of MEF focused on a particular event/audience. Examples
include, but are not limited to, staff meetings, Operational Readiness Exercises (ORE), and
Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) briefings.
5.2. Operational Hours. The staff weather service duty hours are Monday-Friday from 0730L-
1630L. Contingency, emergency, and exercise briefings are provided as required. Given the
current manning of the WF leadership, there will be times when requested staff weather support
cannot be provided or non-WF leadership personnel will fill in.
5.3. Daily 35 FW Stand-up Briefs. Staff weather briefings for the 35 FW are coordinated via
teleconference Monday, Wednesday (1500), and Friday (1300L). Briefings will be placed in
\\mifs002\35mxg\meetings\NewWingStand-up\weather NLT 1430L and 1230L on Friday. The
day forecaster will log into https://connect.dco.dod.mil.r60198176 and call DSN 315-226-0035
NLT 5 minutes prior to roll call. On Tuesday/Thursday, WF leadership or a qualified forecaster
will brief at the Fighter Wing Conference Room (FCWR) at 1500L and 1300L on Thursday for
All Units. Slides are due by 1430 for Tuesday’s briefing. The Thursday briefing will be sent to
35fw.electroniccoordinatio@misawa.af.mil by 1100L.
   5.3.1. The 35 FW stand-up briefs will include an overview of current forecast conditions,
   planning weather for the next day’s missions and a weekly outlook. If required, slides
   detailing specific events (ATR support, FS deployment planning) can be included.
   5.3.2. If a Typhoon is forecast to impact Misawa Air Base within 72 hours, a slide will be
   added with storm graphics. It will be stressed to wing leadership on the uncertainty of the
   forecasted typhoon storm track. The official forecast will only come from the Joint Typhoon
   Warning Center (JTWC) and the WF will not deviate from these products.
5.4. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC)/SOF Briefings. IRC training for the 13 FS and 14
FS are conducted once a month in the OSS Auditorium. The IRC/SOF briefs will be tailored to
the season and focus on local effects.
5.5. Safety Briefs. WF will provide safety briefings as requested at the quarterly flyers safety
brief. The safety topics will be tailored to focus on local effects such as sea fog or lake effect
snow (snow bands).
5.6. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Weather Updates. The WF is responsible for
ensuring all weather information in the FLIP for Misawa AB is accurate. All weather related
updates will be requested through the Airfield Management Operations FLIP Manager, 35
OSS/OSAA. The FLIP Manager will process the information to Air Force Flight Standards
Agency (AFFSA/OL-D). Updates will fall in one of three categories: revisions, changes, or
corrections.
5.7. Pre-Deployment Planning Briefings. The WF will provide pre-deployment weather
briefings when requested for deploying units; usually 13 FS and 14 FS. The content of the
briefing will vary depending on the customer’s requirements. Coordination in advance with the
Flight/CC and NCOIC is requested.

                      SPACE WEATHER SUPPORT AND SERVICES

6.1. General. Misawa’s mission is not heavily affected by space weather. As part of the
forecast process, the WF will indicate any potential solar activity.
6.2. Limitations. One of the biggest limitations in identifying and forecasting space weather is
the lack of sensors available. Additionally, depending on the type of the storm, a solar event can
reach Earth as quickly as fifteen minutes. The ability to accurately provide lead-times for
significant space events is extremely limited.
6.3. Space Weather Alerts and Warnings. Misawa’s missions have a wide variety of
operations possibly affected by various space weather conditions (UHF and VHF
communication, GPS, etc.). Broad space weather coverage over Asia is displayed on NIPRNET
at https://weather.afwa.af.mil/jaawin/space/space_hf.jsp. This product and the Stop Light
Chart (Attachment 4) are used to update the Space Weather portion of the Misawa MEF.
6.4. Products. Most space weather products are ―now-casts‖ and/or very short term forecasts
(6-hour increments). For sanity check, the duty forecaster will check the referenced websites for
updated products when preparing and updating MEFs. For more information concerning these
products, please contact the Misawa WF.

7.5. 35th Civil Engineer Squadron (35 CES).
   7.5.1. The WF will:
      7.5.1.1. During snow season (approximately 15 Nov – 31 Mar) provide freezing
      precipitation/snow forecasts to 35 CES/CEOHP (snow control). This will be produced
      Monday – Friday and will be provided at 0900L. Weekend support will be determined
      by WF Leadership.
      7.5.1.2. Provide input for chemical downwind messages (CDMs) for Misawa AB within
      the first hour after the stand-up of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Chemical,
      Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) cell.
          7.5.1.2.1. The 35 CES/CEX flight uses the Joint Effects Model (JEM) and Arial
          Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA) CBRN plume models. Due to the
          limited availability of model support for the Japan region from DTRA, the 35 CEX
          flight uses CDM data from the WF for inclusion into these models. If more weather
          data is needed, 35 CES/CEX will call the WF for current weather or short term
          forecasts. Since the 35 CES/CEX flight does not use a specific forecast model, the
          WF will give them data from the 17 OWS MOC or the JASDF forecast. The WF will
          provide CDM's from the 17th OWS webpage when requested by 35 CES/CEX.
35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012                                                                      27

                                           Chapter 8

                          RESOURCE PROTECTION SERVICES

8.1. General. This chapter contains details on weather watches, warnings, and advisories
(WWAs). Resource protection is accomplished through a joint effort between the 17 OWS and
the Misawa WF. The 17 OWS is responsible for issuing all forecast products including weather
watches and warnings via IWWC to Airfield Operations, Command Post, Maintenance
Operations Center, and Misawa Emergency Management. The WF acts as the ―eyes forward‖
for 17 OWS and is responsible for issuing all observed warnings and advisories during
operational hours. The WF can issue any forecast warning if there is an immediate threat to life
and/or property. In this case, the WF will back brief the 17 OWS when time permits and will
also be responsible for dissemination to local supported agencies. Conversely, the WF will act
as the alternate dissemination/notification source for the OWS. The goal is to provide the best
possible resource protection to Misawa Air Base.
8.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice sent to customers indicating that
conditions are favorable (potential) for the development of a particular type of weather
phenomena. Watches are issued for a 5 NM radius of the center point of the Misawa runway
complex. Each watch will be assigned a number following the two-digit number of the current
month (i.e. 06-001 would be the first watch of June). Table 8.1 contains all of the weather
watches and desired lead times issued for Misawa AB.
   8.2.1. Heavy fall watch is tailored to local requirements and varies from AFMAN 15-129, 7
   December 2011.

8.3. Weather Warnings. Weather warnings are special notices sent out to customers alerting
them that a predefined weather event, which will pose a threat to life or property, is expected to
occur. Warnings are issued for a 5 NM radius of the center-point of the Misawa AB runway
complex. Each warning will be assigned a number following the two-digit number of the current
 30                                                              35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012


month (i.e. 06-001 would be the first warning of June). Forecast warnings and desired lead times
are contained in Table 8.2.
   8.3.1. Heavy Snowfall warning is tailored to local requirements and varies from AFMAN
   15-129, 7 December 2011.
   8.3.2. The Sandstorm warning is not required by local customers and is not included in the
   table below.

The observed lightning warning will be issued/cancelled by the 17 OWS when the WF is
closed and capability exists.

Note: GTE = Greater than or Equal to
      LT = Less Than
8.4. Observed Weather Warnings. Lightning warnings are the only type of observed warnings
issued on Misawa AB. They extend 5 NM in all directions from the airfield. Lightning
warnings are not issued until lightning is observed, either visually on the WECOM/JAAWIN,
heard, seen in the observation, or deemed otherwise by the Japan Air Self Defense Force,
Weather Squadron.
   8.4.1. The lightning warning will remain valid until lightning has not occurred in the area
       for at least 15 minutes. A lightning warning will not be cancelled; however, if a
       thunderstorm is within 5 NM (observed on radar).
8.5. Forecast and Observed Weather Advisories. A weather advisory is a special notice sent
to customers alerting them that a predefined weather phenomenon, which may impact operations,
is forecast to occur at Misawa AB. An observed weather advisory is a special notice sent to
customers alerting them that a predefined weather phenomenon, which may impact operations, is
occurring on Misawa AB. Forecast and observed weather advisories can be found in Table 8.3.
35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012                                                                        31

²Lightning within 5-30 NM advisory is added due to a needed increase alert time by the
Maintenance Operations Center, safety requirement requested by the Mobile Mine Assembly
Detachment 12 and generator spin-up requirements for the Misawa Security Operations Center.

Notes:
1. Ice FOD criteria are listed below:

Ice FOD A
- Temperature is < 45ºF (7ºC) but > 20º F (-7ºC) with precipitation occurring.
- Temperature-dew point spread < 9ºF (5ºC); and the temperature <45ºF (7ºC) but > 25ºF (-4ºC).

Ice FOD B
- The temperature is < 45º F (7ºC) with standing water or a mixture of water with ice or snow
  within the immediate proximity of the engine inlet.
  - The weather flight does not have the capability to determine the proximity of water or water
  mixture to the engine inlet. Therefore the SOF, with the aid of the pro-super, will determine if
  the HAS and taxi areas are clear of water, ice, or snow.
  - The SOF will inform weather flight if an Ice FOD advisory is needed based on the immediate
    proximity of hazards to the engine inlet.
8.6. Upgrades and Downgrades. Advisories and warnings will be upgraded (i.e. winds
increase from 35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the
desired lead-times specified above. Only one forecast warning may be in effect at a time
except when observed lightning has been issued.
8.7. Amendments. Amendments to weather warnings and watches will only be issued to
change the valid time and will be issued before the original watch or warning expires. New
warnings and watches will be issued for any changes in weather criteria.
8.8. Cancellation. Warnings and watches may be cancelled when the weather phenomena are
no longer occurring or expected to occur. However, if not cancelled, they will expire at the end
 32                                                               35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012


of the valid period. Observed advisories will be cancelled when the criteria is no longer
occurring and is not expected to occur again in the next hour.
8.9. Toxic Corridor. Per 35FWI 10-2501, Emergency Management Program (PA), toxic
corridor responsibilities lie with the Civil Engineering Readiness Flight and Fire Department
Services. The WF will provide any weather information Readiness and/or the Fire Department
require.
8.10. Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP). The SWAP is in place to ensure sufficient
personnel are available during potential/actual severe weather events or during meteorological or
operational events critical to mission success. For the purpose of these procedures, severe
weather is defined as Tornado, Severe Thunderstorms, and Damaging Winds.
   8.10.1. The SWAT will usually consist of a team leader and additional team members
   consisting of the WF Flight Commander and/or NCOIC, depending on availability. WF
   leadership will respond ASAP and will assume SWAT leader duties upon arrival. The WF
   will perform SWAP responsibilities as defined in AFMAN 15-129, Aerospace Weather
   Operations-Processes and Procedures, 17OWS IDP, and this publication.
       8.10.1.1. If the WF is closed (limited duty after hours, weekends, federal holidays), after
       notification by the 17 OWS, the stand-by forecaster (team leader) will respond
       accordingly to the table below, quickly evaluate the situation, and then notify WF
       leadership.
       8.10.1.2. If the WF is open, WF leadership will be immediately notified and will
       determine the appropriate actions.
   8.10.2. While not in SWAP criteria, in the rare case of Tropical Cyclones (TC), the WF
   leadership will immediately notify the CP and evaluate the TC impact within 72 hours of
   affecting Misawa AB (i.e. Misawa is forecasting within the 35 knot radius by 72 hours on the
   Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) official warning). The WF may begin 24/7
   operations when the Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) Authority (see
   Attachment 9 for TCCOR Criteria and Destructive Winds), the FW/CC, initiates TCCOR 2.
   Due to the complex nature of TCs, WF leadership will determine the best course of action to
   address weather support and advise the 35 FW leadership. The WF leadership will also
   stress the accuracy of TC forecasts beyond 72 hours is subject to a wide margin of error.
       8.10.2.1. The WF may provide additional slide(s) to PA so they may post on the
       information on the Misawa website, Facebook or other approved social networking sites,
       and the Commander’s Access Channel to ensure that the Misawa community is informed.

   8.10.3. Activation.
      8.10.3.1. When the 17 OWS issues a WWA that meets SWAP criteria, 17 OWS will
      notify, the duty forecaster, DSN 226-3065 or the stand-by forecaster during limited duty
      hours to start the SWAP procedures. If unable to reach the primary stand-by forecaster,
      17 OWS will notify the WF leadership. Once the SWAP POC has been notified, the
      implementation of the SWAP will begin. The duty/standby forecaster will discuss the
      meteorological situation, manning requirements, and the recall of additional personnel
      with WF leadership. If deemed necessary, the SWAT member will report to the weather
      station as soon as possible after notification by the duty/stand-by forecaster. Once the
      SWAT member has arrived, they will assist in evaluating the situation, determine the
      need and availability to recall additional personnel, and execute the SWAP duties and
      responsibilities in Table 8.5.

                     WEATHER INFORMATION DISSEMINATION

9.1. General. Forecasts, observations, and weather alerts (WWAs) are only useful if the
customers have access to them. It is incumbent on all weather personnel to ensure dissemination
through timely and proper notification. Due to the unique partnership between the Japan Air Self
Defense Force and the 35 OSS WF Flight, weather alerts are disseminated separately among
JASDF and the WF; however, before any WWA is disseminated, mini METCONs are
occasionally performed to ensure consistency between the two forces. The Command Post,
Airfield Management Flight, and Maintenance Operations Center will receive notification via the
IWWC system, JET and/or a telephone call of issuance of a warning, watch, or advisory. See
Attachment 10 for the JET call list. This chapter describes the weather dissemination systems,
dissemination procedures, and backup systems and procedures.
9.2. Dissemination Systems and Backups.
   9.2.1. The Weather Flight currently uses the Joint Environmental Toolkit, JET, as its
   primary disseminating tool. The WF will follow backup dissemination procedures
       documented in the WF SOPs in the event that JET is inoperative.
9.3. Dissemination and Backup Procedures.
   9.3.1. Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories (WWA). WWAs will be disseminated
   via JET. If it is out of service, the WF will call each agency indicated on Attachment 11, to
   pass the information. Further dissemination by Airfield Management Operations and the
   Command Post are as follows:
       9.3.1.1. AMOPS. AMOPS will further relay all weather warnings via the secondary
       crash net to following organizations: Fire Department, CP, Weather, MOC, Security
       Forces, CE Readiness, Emergency Management, Wing Safety, Public Affairs, EOD,
       Vehicle Operations, Hospital, Transient Alert, Navy Duty Desk, MSG/CC, and Barrier
       Maintenance.
       9.3.1.2. 35 FW/CP. The Command Post disseminates all weather watches, warnings,
       and advisories by telephone. Attachment 8 indicates the agencies that are contacted by
       CP.
       9.3.1.3. Lightning Warnings. All lightning warnings are disseminated to the base
       populace via the Giant Voice in addition to AMOPS and the CP to ensure all members on
       base are prepared for inclement weather.
       9.3.1.4. Misawa Weather Channel. The Weather Channel is currently Channel 19 on the
       Misawa cable television system. During a severe weather event, start and end times and
       updates may be added to the normal weather channel slides.
 38                                                             35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012

                              OWS/WF BACKUP SUPPORT

10.1. General. There are many different scenarios that could cause an interruption of service
from either the 17 OWS or the WF. This chapter briefly describes how weather services will be
provided should any events occur.
10.2. 17 OWS. Per the Installation Data Plan (IDP) between Misawa AB and 17 OWS, when
weather operations at 17 OWS are interrupted (i.e. power outage, natural disaster, etc.)
associated weather watch, warning, and advisory responsibilities will be transferred to the WF
until such time as the 17 OWS is postured to resume operations.
10.3. WF. For standard evacuations, support will resume from the alternate operations location
(Bldg 918) with 17 OWS assuming responsibilities during any interim period. For longer
interruptions, the WF will coordinate required support with other organizations.

METWATCH—A deliberate process for monitoring the terrestrial weather or space
environment in an area or region. The purpose of a METWATCH is to identify when and where
observed conditions significantly diverge from forecast conditions and determine courses of
action to update or amend a forecast product or group of products and notify designated
agencies.
Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP)—A systematic, repeatable process for tailoring
weather products and forecasting mission-limiting meteorological parameters and providing
decision quality environmental information for an operational end user. This process provides a
basic framework for fusing perishable meteorological data, operational and strategic forecast
products, and an understanding of the supported user’s tactics which will be applied to any
mission their supported user may undertake. The MEFP describes an end-to-end process
incorporating management steps, forecast development, mission meteorological watch, and post-
mission analysis of the information provided.
Mission Integration—The ability to understand mission platforms, equipment, and systems
capabilities/sensitivities as well as mission processes (e.g., JOPP, MDMP, IPOE, ORM, COP,
tactics, etc.) and inject the right information at the right time every time, enabling mitigation of
environmental threats as early as possible in the mission planning process, ultimately optimizing
mission execution.
Mission Profile—describes a mission’s operating platform(s), route, flight level(s), weapons
systems, equipment, target(s), tactics/techniques/procedures (TTPs), and timing.
MISSIONWATCH—A deliberate process of monitoring terrestrial weather or the space
environment for specific mission-limiting environmental factors that may adversely impact
missions in execution. The MISSIONWATCH process is performed by WFs and WSTs and is
intended to identify previously unidentified environmental threats and alert decision-makers at
the operational unit and/or airborne mission commanders, enabling dynamic changes to mission
profiles that may mitigate the environmental threat and optimize the chance of mission success.
Weather Flight (WF)—Weather flights, detachments, and operating locations whose primary
purpose is to facilitate exploitation of the environment through integration at every step of the
operations planning and execution process. The WF may be located with the supported unit on
an Air Force base, Army post, remotely located in another weather unit, or at a deployed
location.

                      JASDF WEATHER OBSERVING CRITERIA

A2.1. General Information
   A2.1.1. Introduction. The Japan Air Self Defense Force Misawa Weather Squadron, Air
   Weather Service Group, Air Support Command (JASDF Wx) is responsible for taking
   observations. This service is provided 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Radar
      observations are taken at the discretion of the JASDF Weather duty forecaster. Surface
      weather observations are taken IAW JASDF Rules of Aeronautical Meteorological
   Observation (RAMO) Number 14, dated 08 Nov 2006, the MOUI 3005, and the published
   weather minimum for the airfield as determined by US Air Force TERPS.
   A2.1.2. Definitions
      A2.1.2.1. Hourly observation:       A complete observation taken, recorded, and
      disseminated near the beginning of each hour containing the following elements:
          A2.1.2.1.1. Time (GMT)
      A2.1.2.1.2. Wind direction, speed, and character. (10 Minute average)
          A2.1.2.1.3. Prevailing visibility
          A2.1.2.1.4. Runway visual range (when required).
          A2.1.2.1.5. Present weather and obstructions to vision.
          A2.1.2.1.6. Sky condition
          A2.1.2.1.7. Temperature (degrees Celsius)
          A2.1.2.1.8. Dew point (degrees Celsius)
      A2.1.2.1.9. Altimeter setting.
          A2.1.2.1.10. Sea-level pressure (disseminated local and longline).
          A2.1.2.1.11. Remarks on preceding encoded data.
      A2.1.2.2. Special observations. JASDF takes and disseminates five types of special
      observations: SPEC-1, SPECI-2, Q-SPECI, L-SPECI, and A-SPECI. All of these are
      limited element observations taken for meteorological conditions specified by special
      criteria containing in the RAMO, criteria listed in the DoD Flight Instrument Publication
      (FLIP) for Misawa AB, AFMAN 15-111, AFMAN 15-129, and customer
      requirements (JASDF or US Forces). The 5 types are as follows:
      A2.1.2.2.1. SPECI-1: JASDF takes and disseminates locally and longline for severe
      weather conditions or conditions at or below field minimums.
      A2.1.2.2.2. SPECI-2: JASDF takes a SPECI-2 immediately for deteriorating conditions
      (disseminated local and longline). For improving conditions, the RAMO allows for a 10
      minute delay before the observer must take and disseminate a SPECI-2. SPECI-2 marked
      with a ** will only be taken during runway repair.
35FWI15-101 12 JULY 2012                                                                 49


          A2.1.2.2.3. Q-SPECI: JASDF disseminates these locally only and records them for
          permanent record. JASDF does not delay for improving or deteriorating conditions
          marked with
***. No Q-SPECI criteria for wind, RVR, or other weather phenomena.
          A2.1.2.2.4. L-SPECI: Virtually the same as the Q-SPECI. The difference is that the
          L-SPECI is shorter than the Q-SPECI observation. No L-SPECI criteria for winds. L-
          SPECI marked with a * will only be taken when phenomena stops.
          A2.1.2.2.5. A-SPECI: Taken when notified of an aircraft emergency, accident, or
          mishap.

Note 1: Runway Condition Reading (RCR): Base Operations will determine and disseminate RCR
condition. It is not reported in the observation.

Note 2: Location Identifiers: JASDF will disseminate observations for Misawa AB using the identifier
RJSM.

Note 3: 35 FW will accept 5000m as a substitute for 4800m/3M and 2600m as a substitute for 2400m/1
1/2M.

Note 4: 35 FW will accept that the following required AFMAN 15-111 observations are not being
taken.

- Change in Runway. Following notification of a change in the runway in use, where the runway
is dual-instrumented, weather sensors must be changed and allowed sufficient time to update with
current information before taking the observation.

- Altimeter Setting (ALSTG). LOCAL ALSTG observations are taken at an interval not to exceed 35
minutes when there has been a change of 0.01 inch Hg (0.3 hPa) or more since the last ALSTG value. A
METAR or SPECI taken within the established time interval will meet this requirement, or the
observation may be taken and disseminated as a single element LOCAL.

- RVR for the active runway is observed to decrease to less than or, if below, increase to equal or exceed
6,000 feet (1830 meters)

- RVR is first determined as unavailable (RVRNO) for the runway in use, and when it is first determined
that the RVRNO report is no longer applicable, provided conditions for reporting RVR exist.

Note 5: NOTE: USAF weather criteria dictates a SPECI be required for wind direction changes by 45
degrees or more in less than 15 minutes and the wind speed is 10 knots or more throughout the wind
shift, however wind SPECI observations will be taken according to JASDF criteria stated above.

Note 6: Values for SPECI-1 may be added or changed on a temporary basis based upon runway and
flight pattern conditions when specified by TERPS as a valid weather minimum for the airfield (per
MOUI 3005). Changes will be published in the DoD Flight Information Publication. All communication
of said changes will occur through the JASDF chain of command.

   A2.1.3. Procedures: JASDF Wx:
       A2.1.3.1. Takes and records observations IAW criteria outlined above.
       A2.1.3.2. Disseminates observations locally to 35 OSS/OSW via WECOM.
       A2.1.3.3. Corporative weather watch does not exist between JASDF and USAF and
       therefore, according to the JASDF Rules of Aeronautical Meteorological Observation
       (RAMO), tower visibility is not required.
   A2.1.4. Procedures should the weather observing tower be disabled or destroyed:
       A2.1.4.1. The JASDF Weather Squadron will deploy weather observers to a mobile
       location on the southeast side of the ramp. Observers will take observations 24 hours
       daily and transmit them by radio or telephone to the JASDF weather office in the sector
       operations center/direction center (SOC/DC) if operations in building 998 are not
       possible.
       A2.1.4.2. Because these observations most likely won’t be taken using calibrated fixed
       meteorological equipment, all observed elements will be estimated. No RVR will be
       available.

                                   35 FW SENSITIVITIES

A3.1. The following are the 35 FW weather sensitivities. Reference Table A3.1 for the different
mission types and the weather required to execute each mission.
   A3.1.1. Max crosswind component is 25 knots (dry)
   A3.1.2. Max crosswind component is 23 knots (wet)
   A3.1.3. Sustained winds of 35 knots or greater can cancel flying. This is the threshold for
   safe pilot aircraft ejection.
   A3.1.4. Wind gusts 50 knots or greater: This threshold closes the flight line.
   A3.1.5. Thunderstorms within 5-30nm: Assume that severe turbulence, icing, hail, low-level
   wind shear, and lightning in the vicinity of the storms.
   A3.1.6. Lightning within 5nm: Restricts local traffic and refueling on the flight line.
   Lightning can strike the airfield any time there are thunderstorms within 10nm.
   A3.1.7. Wind Chill Temperature of < -25°F: Seriously impairs flight line operations.
   A3.1.8. Winds > 25kt and/or > 10ft sea heights in the flying areas causes F16 pilots to
   remain within gliding distance of the land.
   A3.1.9. Winds > 35kt in the flying areas results in cancellation of missions in the flying
   areas.
   A3.1.10. Space weather only interferes with the on-board radar. It does not prevent the
   sortie from launching.

A4.2. Electro Optics Tactical Decision Aid (EOTDA and Targeting Pod (TGP) Support.
   A4.2.1. The WF, through its Mission Integration Function, provides target acquisition and
   flight planning data to the 13 FS and 14 FS. The Mission Integration Function works closely
   with pilots within each fighter squadron to provide this information, such as EOTDA and
   TGP forecast data. Pilots must coordinate with Mission Integration Function forecasters for
   additional requirements.
   A4.2.2. The WF has the capability to provide target acquisition data to any flying customer
   operating from Misawa AB. All units will notify the WF of any special Tactical Decision Aid
   (TDA) requests at least 24 hours in advance.

  TROPICAL CYCLONE CONDITIONS OF READINESS (TCCOR) CRITERIA AND
                      DESTRUCTIVE WINDS

Figure A9.1. TCCOR Criteria and Destructive Winds
Destructive Winds is defined as 50 knots sustained or greater.
TCCOR 4                 Destructive winds are possible within 72 hours.
TCCOR 3                 Destructive winds are possible within 48 hours.
TCCOR 2                 Destructive winds anticipated within 24 hours.
TCCOR 1                 Destructive winds anticipated within 12 hours.
TCCOR 1 Caution* Winds of 35-49 knots sustained are occurring on the installation.
TCCOR 1                 Winds 50 knots sustained or greater are occurring on the installation.
Emergency
TCCOR Recovery* After the passage of a TC when destructive winds have subsided, work
                        and survey crews are sent out to determine the extent of damage and to
                        establish safe zones around hazards. Until the recovery process is
                        declared complete (TCCOR All Clear), the general base population
                        would normally be asked to remain indoors.
TCCOR All Clear*        The storm is over and not forecast to return and recovery efforts are
                        considered complete by the installation commander.
TCCOR Storm             The storm is over and not forecast to return (declared by the TCCOR
Clear                   Authority).
TCCOR Storm             The winds are not forecast to exceed 50 knots but there still exists a
Watch                   probability of high winds due to the proximity of the storm. The storm is
                        also close enough to the area that a heightened alert status is necessary
                        in order to rapidly establish regular TCCOR condition should the storm
                        deviate from the forecast track. Personnel should follow Standard
                        Operation Procedures for TCCOR Storm Watch and stay alert for any
                        changes to TCCOR status
* Note: TCCOR 1 Caution/Emergency/Recovery/All Clear is delegated to the Installation
Commander by the TCCOR Authority (For Misawa AB, the TCCOR Authority is the Installation
Commander).
