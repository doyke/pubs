                                             Chapter 1

                                     MEDIA OPERATIONS

Section 1A—Purpose and Objectives of Media Operations

1.1. Purpose of Media Operations. Media operations are essential for achieving the Public
Affairs (PA) core competencies of Airman morale and readiness, public trust and support, and
global influence and deterrence. Media operations expertise is also critical to an expeditionary
PA force.
1.2. Objectives of the Air Force Media Operations Program.
     1.2.1. Target audiences with Air Force messages to achieve specified effects.
     1.2.2. Deploy time-sensitive information.
     1.2.3. Convey Air Force core competencies to a broader audience.
     1.2.4. Target media strategies to an international audience, especially in expeditionary
     settings.

Section 1B—General Release of Information

1.3. Responsibilities. Senior commanders are responsible for releasing information within their
purview. The Secretary of the Air Force Office of Public Affairs (SAF/PA) director is the
coordination authority for all Air Force media activities and issues that have national or
international implications. Even though material is unclassified or has been cleared through
security and policy review channels, do not give it to the public unless the commander (or the
commander’s authorized PA representative) approves it for that purpose. See Air Force Policy
Directive 35-1, Public Affairs Management, for more detailed policy information on authorities.
     1.3.1. All military and civilian personnel must comply with the Secretary of Defense’s
     (SECDEF) Principles of Information, (see DODD 5122.05 for more information) and the Air
     Force’s “full disclosure/minimum delay” standards, thereby assuring commanders and PA
     staffs of rapid, accurate, and continuous flow of information to the public.
        1.3.1.1. Present Air Force information professionally, simply, and honestly.
        1.3.1.2. Be accurate, prompt, and factual.
        1.3.1.3. Confine the information to field of expertise.
        1.3.1.4. Avoid the hypothetical and speculative.
        1.3.1.5. Reflect Air Force policy.
     1.3.2. Classified Information. Do not release classified information. See paragraph 1.22 for
     circumstances when exposure to sensitive or classified information is allowed. Consult DOD
     5200.1-R, Information Security Program, AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
     Management, and AFI 35-102, Security and Policy Program. These publications tell how to
     classify, downgrade, and declassify information; who may release and receive certain
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                   7


   information; what to do before telling the public about weapons systems; how to challenge
   the classification of material; and how open publication affects classified material.
       1.3.2.1. Commanders will inform PA on all important operations and operational
       information affecting the organization, including any classified aspects.
       1.3.2.2. Unfavorable information must not be classified or withheld simply to avoid
       criticism of the Air Force.
1.4. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act. Federal law, Department of
Defense (DOD) and Air Force policy require prompt and accurate disclosure of information to
the public. The following documents are important for PA to learn the parameters of the FOIA
(Title 5, United States Code, Section 552) and Privacy Act in DODD 5400.7, DOD Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) Program/Air Force Supplement, the Privacy Act of 1974 (Title 5, United
States Code, Section 552a), DOD 5400.11-R, Department of Defense Privacy Program, and AFI
33-332, Privacy Act Program. The FOIA directs maximum release of information. According to
DOD, the commander, through PA and with the advice of the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA),
should provide media releasable information without forcing news media representatives to go
through FOIA channels. Since the implementation of FOIA policy is affected by a number of
policy memos and other controlling documents that are updated with greater frequency than the
applicable laws and directives, always consult the local SJA, the Privacy Act office, and the
DOD policy letters when releasing personal information.
   1.4.1. Withholding of Information that Personally Identifies DOD Personnel. Release of
   information on DOD personnel will be limited to the names, official titles, organizations, and
   telephone numbers for personnel only at the office director level or above, provided a
   determination is made that disclosure does not raise security or privacy concerns. This
   requires the SJA to provide advice in a timely manner. However, media representatives can
   request information under FOIA, completely bypassing PA. FOIA channels take longer than
   PA due to administrative procedures, and the FOIA office does not provide explanations or
   answer questions. In cases where news media representatives submit FOIA requests but PA
   can provide more information in a more rapid timeframe, the FOIA and PA offices should
   coordinate responses.
   1.4.2. Consideration of rights of living relatives and associates of deceased Air Force
   personnel. The Privacy Act and the privacy exemptions of the FOIA do not protect the
   personal privacy of deceased persons. Records about the deceased, however, may be
   withheld under FOIA or the Privacy Act to protect the privacy of living relatives and
   associates if the records contain private, personal information about the family or others that
   would adversely affect a recognized privacy right of living individuals.
   1.4.3. The Privacy Act was designed to protect individuals. It may prevent the Air Force
   from disclosing information to the news media even though an individual may have already
   chosen to voluntarily discuss Privacy Act matters with reporters. If individuals want the Air
   Force to assist the news media with a particular matter, they can waive their rights under the
   Privacy Act by signing a Privacy Act release. On a case-by-case basis, PA should consider
   the option of contacting the individual to offer a Privacy Act release. This release document
   must be signed and dated by the individual waiving his or her rights. Public Affairs are
   advised to consult and coordinate the release with the SJA prior to signature, and individuals
   are advised to consult legal assistance before signing the release.

        1.4.3.1. While a Privacy Act release statement can be tailored, an example of a Privacy
        Act release statement is: "I hereby authorize Air Force officials to disclose any
        information about me, whether or not protected by the Privacy Act, Freedom of
        Information Act, or any Air Force directives to [specific news organization or person] in
        response to [his/her] interest in my case."
1.5. Special Policy. Special policies often govern the release of information. Policies come
from the Secretary of the Air Force and Headquarters Air Force, sometimes supporting Higher
Headquarters policies. Major commands (MAJCOMs) can provide additional guidance to
policies.
1.6. Published, Released or Cleared Information. Do not assume information about the Air
Force has been officially released simply because it appears in the media. Neither does the
appearance of classified information in the public realm mean it is now unclassified, nor can it be
used or referred to by Air Force spokespersons. Operational or technical information combined
for re-release must meet the same release standards as the original information.
1.7. Air Force People. Occasions may arise when special directives control releasable
information about individuals under certain conditions. For additional guidance on the release of
casualty information see paragraphs 1.27 and 2.6. The following guidelines apply to the release
of information:
     1.7.1. Address. Home of record, home address, and home telephone number generally are
     not releasable. It is permissible to release the home of record of deceased Airmen.
     1.7.2. Administrative Actions. Administrative discharge boards or aviator flight boards
     generally are not releasable. Selective early retirement boards and reduction in force boards
     are boards affecting individuals and are not generally releasable.
     1.7.3. Age and Date of Birth. Generally not releasable without consent of member. It is
     permissible to release ages of deceased Airmen.
     1.7.4. Biographies and Photographs of Key Persons. Official photographs and biographies of
     general officers and key military and civilians maintained according to official biography
     requirements are releasable. For people other than these individuals, official photographs and
     biographies generally are not releasable.
     1.7.5. Death of Civilian Employee or Military Personnel. See AFI 36-809, Civilian Survivor
     Assistance, for more details on civilian employees. The apparent cause of death (i.e.
     homicide, suicide) generally is not releasable until the investigation is completed and after
     consultation with the investigative agency. Any news releases and interviews will not include
     tentative or speculative conclusions or use terms such as “homicide”, “suicide”, or “self
     inflicted”. Comments concerning the death should be limited to, “The cause of death is under
     investigation (or undetermined).” Release will not be made until 24 hours after next-of-kin
     (NOK) notification.
     1.7.6. Discharges. Information regarding administrative discharges generally is not
     releasable. Do not release information about honorable, under honorable conditions
     (general), or under other than honorable conditions unless the affected person gives written
     consent. Note: If a case has received extensive publicity, this information may be releasable
     (ask the local SJA or SAF/PA for guidance in this situation.) If the discharge results from a
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                  9


  court-martial, the record of trial is a public document. The sentence and subsequent clemency
  action, if any, are releasable.
  1.7.7. Duty Location. Current, past, and future assignments are releasable, except sensitive
  and overseas assignments masked in unit records. Current or future assignments, office and
  unit address and duty phone for personnel or units stationed overseas or for routinely
  deployable or sensitive units are generally not releasable.
  1.7.8. Duty Status. Releasable (active duty, retired, etc.) The following information
  concerning duty status is also releasable: military grade and rank; civilian grade; military
  basic pay; civilian gross salary; and all allowances except basic allowance for housing
  (BAH). In addition, duty telephone number; date of rank (DOR); entered active duty date
  (EAD); pay date; source of commission; and promotion sequence number, Air Force
  specialty code (unless operational security considerations warrant withholding a specific duty
  descriptions), position title, office, unit address, and professional military education are
  releasable. See AFI 33-332 for other items that are releasable, not requiring consent under the
  Privacy Act Program.
  1.7.9. Education. Information concerning civilian educational degrees and major areas of
  study, school and year of graduation generally is not releasable without written consent of the
  member.
  1.7.10. Employers of Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard Members. Not releasable
  without the consent of the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard member.
  1.7.11. Family Members. Family members, including number or gender of family members,
  are not releasable.
  1.7.12. Gender. Releasable.
  1.7.13. General Officer Assignments. General officer assignments are announced by Office
  of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs (OASD/PA) in coordination with the
  White House and other agencies or departments. Note: An assignment within a MAJCOM or
  FOA may be announced by the MAJCOM or FOA commander after HQ USAF has
  published orders on the assignment.
  1.7.14. Marital Status (single, divorced, married, widowed) or information about family
  members, including number or gender, generally not releasable.
  1.7.15. Military Awards and Decorations or Citations. Releasable.
  1.7.16. Military Personnel Records. See AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel Records System.
  Personnel board decisions should follow this rule: Actions that affect groups, such as
  promotion boards or augmentation boards, generally are releasable.
  1.7.17. Name. Releasable within guidelines described.
  1.7.18. Names of Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard (ANG) Aircrew members
  involved in incidents under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are
  generally not releasable during the investigation. Air Force policy is for crewmembers to
  assist FAA by using their assigned radio call signs. Coordinate responses to such queries
  with the flying safety officer or director of operations. See Chapter 2, Crisis
  Communication, and AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, for more information.
 10                                                         AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


   1.7.19. Prisoners. Base releases about stockade or guardhouse prisoner escapes, unusual
   incidents, or disturbances in local confinement facilities lead to satisfactory relations with the
   general public and the news media. Limit release to information on the Department of
   Defense (DD) Form 553, Deserter/Absentee Wanted by the Armed Forces, if not otherwise
   prohibited [e.g., blocks 5n (SSN) and 16 (Relatives and/or Persons Known).]
   1.7.20. Prisoners of War and Missing in Action (POW/MIA). OASD/PA regulates
   information release for POW/MIA situations. Since hostilities and conditions of peace vary,
   information policy changes periodically. SAF/PA distributes current policy via AFPD 35-1,
   Public Affairs Management.
   1.7.21. Race or National Origin. Generally releasable.
1.8. Accidents and Safety. See Chapter 2, Crisis Communication, and AFI 91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports.
1.9. Pre-Trial Publicity. Legal directives provide detailed guidance concerning the types of
releasable information before a trial. In all cases, closely coordinate with the installation Staff
Judge Advocate (SJA) before releasing information. Serious charges are newsworthy, especially
those that directly or indirectly concern the public. These may include cases for flying violations,
aircraft accidents, and nonmilitary offenses such as larcenies and assaults allegedly committed
by Air Force people in the community. Air Force guidance for releasing information on criminal
proceedings is that:
   1.9.1. Media representatives, as members of the public, may attend open sessions of Air
   Force courts.
   1.9.2. Cameras, video equipment, and audio equipment are generally not permitted in Air
   Force courtrooms during court sessions (see Manual for Courts Martial for more guidance).
   1.9.3. News releases should convey that military and civilian courts are similar, based on the
   principle that the accused is considered innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable
   doubt.
   1.9.4. Releasable material may include:
       1.9.4.1. Names of persons charged with crimes unless the person is a minor.
       1.9.4.2. Date and nature of the alleged offense, as shown in the court-martial order.
       1.9.4.3. Sentence.
       1.9.4.4. Type of punitive discharge (if any) from the Air Force, and whether it was
       executed, suspended, or remitted.
       1.9.4.5. Confinement circumstances or date of release from confinement.
       1.9.4.6. Previous convictions or absence of them.
       1.9.4.7. Findings of Guilty or Not guilty.
   1.9.5. Avoid sensationalism, exaggeration, and use of the term “criminal." Do not use
   editorial words prejudicial to the accused before trial, such as hit-and-run driver, deserter, or
   murderer. Before conviction, releases may say the accused is charged with the crime or
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                   11


   alleged to have committed it. Avoid military terms, jargon, clichés, or slang unless in a direct
   quote.
   1.9.6. Media interviews and telephonic communication between media and people in
   confinement are prohibited by DODD 1325.04, Confinement of Military Prisoners and
   Administration of Military Correctional Programs and Facilities, and AFI 31-205, The Air
   Force Corrections System.
   1.9.7. Do not release the names of minor children or other victims.
1.10. Dissident. Dissident and protest activities are rare in the Air Force. They might
concern human rights, political activism, or other causes. As a rule, protests arise from local
grievances. Problem resolution must stay at that level to be effective. Local commanders are
responsible for solving the problem. Consult with installation experts, such as the equal
opportunity officer, SJA, and/or chaplain. See Chapter 2, Crisis Communication, for more
information.
1.11. Gifts to the Air Force. Gifts are a contribution, donation, bequest, or device offered to
the Air Force. Guidance on gifts to individuals can be found in DOD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics
Regulation, AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force, and AFI 51-901, Gifts from
Foreign Governments. Gifts to the Air Force must be desirable, useful, and contribute to the
health, comfort, and morale of Air Force people. Acceptance is based on the best interests of the
Air Force, subject to the rules established in AFI 51-601.
1.12. Investigations or Reports by Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI). See
AFPD 71-1, Criminal Investigations and Counterintelligence; AFI 71-101V1, Criminal
Investigations, AFI 71-101V2, Protective Service Matters, and AFI 71-101V4,
Counterintelligence.
1.13. Legal Procedures and Litigation. See AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation.
1.14. DOD Homosexual Conduct Policy. Refer to the most current PA guidance and contact
the local SJA and higher headquarters (HHQ) PA for specific guidance.
1.15. Force Structure Announcements. As a matter of policy, Force Structure or Base
Realignment and Closure announcements are made at HQ USAF level. No public comments
should be made until official announcements are made at the headquarters level and
congressional notification has been completed. PAs must work closely with the SJA and the
manpower and organization experts as well as HHQ PA to prepare and coordinate questions and
answers and news releases before commenting.
1.16. Reduction in Force (RIF). Consult SAF/PA before releasing any reduction in force
information.
1.17. Scientists and Engineers. Significant work by Air Force scientists and engineers can be
releasable. See AFI 38-203, Commercial Activities Program, for information.
1.18. Technical Documents. See AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical
Information.
1.19. Contracts and Contractors’ Releases.
   1.19.1. Unclassified Contracts. Companies or institutions with unclassified Air Force
   contracts may release information about them unless the contract states otherwise. DOD
 12                                                        AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


   5220.22-R, Industrial Security Regulation, governs release of information by colleges and
   universities holding unclassified research and development contracts or letters of intent. The
   following may be released without further DOD approval:
       1.19.1.1. A statement that the contract, letter of intent, or supplement agreement has been
       received. Certain types of contracts (such as proposals for a new electronic system, a
       high-altitude research study, etc.) may be released if this information is not limited by the
       contract.
       1.19.1.2. Information of public or professional interest about the work being done, if this
       information is not limited by terms of the contract.
       1.19.1.3. Information previously approved for release.
   1.19.2. Classified Contracts. Companies or institutions with classified Air Force contracts
   prepare initial information announcements relating to new Air Force programs. DOD
   5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, regulates these
   announcements. The manual is an attachment to DD Form 441, Department of Defense
   Security Agreement. The agreement enables a company to receive classified contracts and the
   classified information to meet them. This agreement prohibits the contractor from releasing
   information that pertains to classified contracts or projects until it is approved for this
   purpose. The contractor usually sends it directly to the Office of the Secretary of Defense
   Directorate for Security Review for approval.
       1.19.2.1. The contract may specifically require the contractor to route the proposed
       release through an Air Force organization. In this case, PA reviews and clears the
       information for unrestricted publication. PA must coordinate the proposed release with
       the appropriate system program office, security office, and other interested agencies. If a
       non-DOD agency awards the classified contract or project to the contractor, requests for
       information release are sent to that agency.

Section 1C—Release of Information on Operational Subjects

1.20. Alert Status. Information concerning changes of alert status or defense readiness
condition (DEFCON) may be released only by SAF/PA and only after coordination with
OASD/PA. In addition, PA offices at all levels must be notified at once by their local command
post when there are changes in alert status. The local force protection condition (FPCON) may
be released to the general public if conditions affect the local community. For example, if the
base will be closed or a security check at the gate will be instituted causing disruption to local
traffic patterns, release the information. However, do not release the steps taken during a FPCON
except to say that the unit is increasing its vigilance. Consult MAJCOM PA offices for additional
guidance.
1.21. Deployments.
   1.21.1. Releasable information. Release guidance from SAF/PA or MAJCOM PA usually
   precedes a deployment. However, if it is obvious the unit has departed, confirm the obvious
   but notify SAF/PA or MAJCOM PA of the information release. Unless directed otherwise,
   the following items of information are releasable:
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                  13

     could harm mission accomplishment.
     1.21.2.21. Information on operational or support vulnerabilities.
     1.21.2.22. Specific methods and tactics, speeds, and formations.
  1.21.3. Movement of Units. As previously mentioned, release guidance from HHQ PA
  usually precedes a deployment, but if it is obvious that a unit has departed, confirm the
  obvious but notify the HHQ PA office.
     1.21.3.1. Continental United States (CONUS) to Overseas. Information on the movement
     of Air Force units to overseas areas must be released initially by OASD/PA, unless
     delegation is authorized. SAF/PA will immediately notify all MAJCOM PA offices that
     directly or indirectly concerned that such a release is being made. The time and content of
     the release must be included in this notification. In addition, guidance on releasing any
     information subsequent to the initial release must be incorporated. This guidance applies
     to all commands affected by the move, even if the unit is only passing through.
     MAJCOM PA offices will disseminate the guidance immediately to their affected units.
     Unit PAOs and commanders must comply strictly with the policy outlined in the
     notification, deviating from it only when specifically authorized by SAF/PA.
     1.21.3.2. Within Overseas Areas. Within overseas areas, movement releases are
     governed by instructions issued by the theater commander.
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                     15


       1.21.3.3. Within CONUS. For unit movements within the CONUS, the following
       information is releasable:
           1.21.3.3.1. Designation of Unit.
           1.21.3.3.2. Name and location of new station, assembly point, training area, etc.,
           within the U.S., unless the movement itself or new station is classified.
           1.21.3.3.3. Departure date, if routing for training, and details of movement are not
           classified.
           1.21.3.3.4. General information necessary for local civic relations, such as housing,
           recreation, etc.
           1.21.3.3.5. On arrival at new station within the United States, resume normal PA
           activities.
1.22. Access to Sensitive Information. Unit commanders may determine that coverage of a
story will involve exposure to sensitive or classified information, but coverage of which is in the
best interests of the Air Force. The primary safeguard will be to brief the reporter in advance
about what information is sensitive and what the parameters are for covering this type of
information. The commander may offer access if the reporter agrees to a security and policy
review of the communication product. Agreement to a security and policy review in exchange
for this type of access is strictly voluntary; however, if a reporter does not agree, then access to
sensitive information may be denied. If a reporter agrees to a security and policy review, it will
be conducted solely to ensure that sensitive or classified information is not included in the
product.
1.23. Intelligence or Reconnaissance Activities. News releases may not be made regarding
intelligence activities, except as authorized by SAF/PA.
1.24. Chemical, Biological and Radiological Warfare. Air Force PA material that deals with
chemical, biological, or radiological warfare must be cleared by OASD/PA, through SAF/PA.
1.25. Simulated Employment of Nuclear Weapons on Maneuvers and Training
Exercises. The fact that a particular maneuver or exercise will involve the simulated
employment of nuclear weapons may be released to news media as the maneuver or exercise
commander deems necessary. However, the technique required in the use of any nuclear weapon
must not be released.
1.26. Personnel Wounded in Combat. PA must exercise care in releasing information and
photographs of personnel wounded in action or hospitalized for other reasons. The governing
concerns are patient welfare, patient privacy, and next of kin/family considerations. OASD/PA,
unless it delegates authority to the combatant command PA, will issue an initial news release
acknowledging that combat injuries have occurred. After the initial release, the services may
release additional information on casualties, consistent with the Privacy Act.
1.27. Casualties. IAW with DODI 1300.18, Military Personnel Casualty Matters, Policies, and
Procedures, no casualty information on deceased military personnel may be released to the media
or the general public until 24 hours after notifying the next-of-kin regarding the casualty status of
the member. Information on ill or injured Airmen may not be released without the consent of the
individual, unless the release is otherwise authorized by the Privacy Act of 1974. In the cases of
service members who have been unaccounted for from past conflicts, public release cannot occur
 16                                                        AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


until 24 hours after the next of kin accepts the member’s identification or 24 hours after the next
of kin has been notified that the Armed Forces Identification Review Board has upheld the
identification. For more guidance on releasable information, see paragraphs 1.7.1 through
1.7.21.
   1.27.1. Medical Care Facilities. Media visits are authorized to medical care facilities but
   must be approved by the medical facility commander and attending physician and must not
   interfere with medical treatment. Patients are not to be photographed if they can be identified
   in the photo or interviewed without informed signed consent. Informed signed consent is also
   required for medical staff to release information about patients. A PA escort is required for
   all media visits to medical facilities.
   1.27.2. Unit casualties and losses. Information on unit casualties and losses should be
   described in general terms only, e.g., light, moderate, heavy. The use of percentages,
   numbers of aircraft damaged or destroyed, buildings, facilities, vehicles, etc., will not be
   released without approval of the combatant commander, a designated representative, or
   OASD/PA.
   1.27.3. Aeromedical Evacuation Flights. Media requests to travel aboard aeromedical
   evacuation flights will be considered on a case-by-case basis. For more information and
   request procedures, see AFI 35-103, Public Affairs Travel.
   1.27.4. Transfer of casualties to the United States. Media visits to Dover Air Force Base are
   authorized with primary Next of Kin approval, based upon the Secretary of Defense’s March
   25, 2009 memo, “DoD Policy Regarding Media Access to Dignified Transfers at Dover
   AFB.”
1.28. Casualty Notification to Next of Kin (NOK). Although not an official part of a casualty
notification team, in cases with high potential for media interest, PA has a valuable role in
assisting with Air Force casualty NOK notification.
   1.28.1. Responsibilities.
       1.28.1.1. PA should assess the media climate and, in potentially high visibility cases
       (combat related, mass casualties, homicides, etc.) or duty status-whereabouts unknown
       (DUSTWUN), missing or captured, advise the commander of the likelihood of news
       media contacting the family members of the deceased Airman and offer PA support to the
       family.
       1.28.1.2. The local commander or notification officer may request that PA accompany
       the NOK notification team when there are indications of high media interest and the
       possibility of news media contacting the deceased’s family members directly.
       1.28.1.3. When accompanying the NOK notification team, the PA should travel with the
       notification team but wait while notification is made to the family and remain available if
       the family requests contact.
       1.28.1.4. After the NOK notification is completed, the notification officer will provide
       the family an installation-specific PA Media Information Paper. The PA Media
       Information Paper should include the installation public affairs office contact information
       as well as a list of services the installation PA office can provide the family if there is
       media interest. If requested by the family, the PA office will advise the family on
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                 17


       interaction with the news media, offer assistance with any public statements, and define
       the family’s preferences on news media requests for information.
       1.28.1.5. If the news media is already at the family’s residence or calling during the
       notification, PA should offer to act as the liaison between the news media and the family,
       in keeping with the family’s preferences.
       1.28.1.6. Casualty notification officers in remote areas who do not have PA support will
       provide the family contact information for the Casualty Center (AFPCC) (1-800-433-
       0048). The AFPCC will contact the on-call PA representative if needed.
1.29. Unit Activations, Inactivations, Phasedowns, or Movements. A significant change in
unit level of operations is extremely important news for local communities. This change takes
place after deliberation at appropriate levels of government. PA personnel should not discuss
these subjects without guidance from HHQ PA.
1.30. Weapon Systems. This category includes aircraft, missiles, munitions, support systems,
subsystems, and space vehicles. Information about the existence, characteristics, potential or
demonstrated capabilities of new systems, or improvements or modifications of existing ones
must be reviewed by SAF/PA before it is released. The same is true for military applications of
nuclear energy, and the following types of warfare subjects: biological, radiological, chemical,
electronic, and psychological.

Section 1D—Working with the Media

1.31. General Guidelines. The media’s need for rapid, accurate information requires
immediate response by Air Force officials. It is important to understand media capabilities,
organization, technology, and deadlines. Information on working with the media is available on
the Air Force PA Community of Practice (CoP).
   1.31.1. Access to Installations. Bona fide media representatives, freelance writers, and
   photographers may visit Air Force installations. PA must notify the security forces at the
   main gate or visitor center and escort media at all times when they are on a military
   installation.
   1.31.2. Bad News. When bad news occurs, release it quickly and candidly.
   1.31.3. (Added-AU) AFJROTC units are not required to have an organized public affairs
   program. However, media queries and requests for interviews beyond routine requests such
   as unit demographics, history, activities, etc., should be coordinated with Air University
   Public Affairs (AU/PA) prior to scheduling the interview or providing information. Units
   should also coordinate interviews with host school administration. AFROTC detachments
   are required to coordinate all media queries and requests for interviews from local, regional
   or national media sources with AU/PA before responding to queries or granting interviews.
       1.31.3.1. (Added-AU) Detachment and unit cadre and cadets cannot participate in
       public discussion forums hosted by media or on call-in television/radio shows nor any
       call-in, forum, or public discussion activity sponsored by any political party.
       1.31.3.2. (Added-AU) AU/PA’s responsibility is to coordinate all media queries with
       Holm Center Headquarters/AETC Headquarters and attempt to meet the reporter's
       deadline. However, deadlines will not be met at the expense of accuracy. Most media
 18                                                       AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


       queries can be answered within 24 hours. If there is a delay in obtaining the requested
       information, detachments and units will be advised to call the reporter/editor or producer
       and explain the delay.
       1.31.3.3. (Added-AU) Following are some guidelines to assist in handling any requests
       that are subsequently approved (Note: Reporters are not required to submit specific
       questions. Typically, they will provide general line of questioning. Their refusal to
       submit specific questions should not be grounds to cancel the interview):
           1.31.3.3.1. (Added-AU) Select for interviews the most experienced, articulate cadre
           and cadets; pre-brief them on the types of questions they may be asked based on the
           reporter’s topic.
           1.31.3.3.2. (Added-AU) Detachment Commanders/Senior Aerospace Studies
           Instructors should be present to monitor the interview with the understanding that it
           will be terminated if media broach subjects/questions other than those mutually
           agreed upon.
           1.31.3.3.3. (Added-AU) Cadets may give their personal thoughts and talk about
           their personal experiences but should not represent themselves as official
           spokespersons for AFROTC/AFJROTC or the Air Force. As a general guideline,
           interviewees should speak only on topics with which they are personally and
           intimately familiar and current -- AFROTC/AFJROTC programs. Military operations,
           plans or specific capabilities of the USAF should not be discussed or speculated
           about.
       1.31.3.4. (Added-AU) Advise AU/PA when situations involving subjects of a sensitive
       nature occur. Some of the subjects include, but are not limited to:
           1.31.3.4.1. (Added-AU) Any topic with the potential to create adverse publicity.
           1.31.3.4.2. (Added-AU) Anti-military/ROTC/JROTC                demonstrations        on
           campus/school grounds.
           1.31.3.4.3. (Added-AU) Sensitive DoD matters such as the policies governing
           homosexual behavior.
1.32. Exclusive Requests. An exclusive is a reporter’s request for information that no other
reporter has asked for. It can involve a minor or major story. The Air Force allows reporters to
work on exclusives, but it is obligated to provide the same information to other reporters.
Reporters should be made aware of this policy to avoid misunderstandings. Interviews, by their
nature, are exclusive in terminology, i.e., quotes and statements, but not in content if another
reporter requests it.
   1.32.1. Minor Story. This news is not particularly significant. Protect the reporter’s story
   until a similar request comes from another reporter. If this happens, tell the second reporter
   that another media representative is already working on it. The second reporter probably
   won’t press the issue. If pressed, provide the same material to the second reporter and inform
   the first reporter that another individual is also working the story.
   1.32.2. Major Story. Do not honor any request for exclusive information on a truly major
   story. The Air Force must release information on major stories to all media equally. The
   public’s right to significant news transcends the right of a single reporter who first asked for
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                    19


   the information. In-depth feature stories on major issues may be treated exclusively until
   similar queries come from other reporters or major developments require a general release.
1.33. Air Force Reports on News Programs. Air Force members may do regular reports of
installation news on radio or television stations, if the subject matter pertains exclusively to Air
Force life and activities. All material must be read from written scripts approved by the proper
authority.
1.34. Review of Material. Do not ask a reporter to send material for review unless security
considerations are involved. The primary responsibility for protecting classified information lies
with the Air Force, not the reporter, and the reporter can justifiably refuse any requests for prior
review. The primary safeguard should be to brief the reporter in advance about what information
is sensitive and what the parameters are for covering this type of information.
1.35. Duty Officer. PA offices must have a designated representative available 24 hours a day
for significant breaking news stories, accidents, and other events that require immediate PA
action. Arrange to have someone on call during off-duty hours. Brief security forces, operations
centers, and telephone personnel on the procedures for contacting the off-duty representative. An
instruction book should be prepared for the off-duty representative’s use. At a minimum, it
should contain emergency checklists and off-duty telephone numbers of PA staff members and
key unit installation officials. Instruction books must be checked frequently to ensure
instructions and officials’ names and telephone numbers are current.
1.36. News Releases. The news release is the most common way to deliver information to the
media. It may announce news or answer anticipated queries. The news release varies in length,
but most often is a page of newsworthy information. Prepare news releases according to the
guidelines on the AF PA CoP.
   1.36.1. (Added-AU) AFROTC detachments are encouraged to make routine news releases
   concerning unit activities and personnel to local and regional news media. Use the host
   university's campus news bureau or public relations office for assistance with routine
   releases. News releases intended for national media should be sent to AU/PA for review and
   possible distribution.
1.37. Classified Answers. If an answer is classified, tell the reporter you cannot provide the
information because it is classified. If possible, explain why it’s classified.
1.38. Pooling Media. Consider pooling when circumstances such as limited space preclude
accommodating all the media wanting to cover a story. Keep in mind most media dislike pool
arrangements and prefer to do their own reporting. A news pool involves having a representative
from the media (or one representative from the various media, such as print, television, and
radio) cover the story and then feed reports to all media taking part in the pool. Use pools only
when circumstances absolutely preclude accommodating all interested media. Always let media
decide procedures on how representatives are selected and how stories are distributed
1.39. Air Force Visual Information (VI) Support for Media. The Air Force supports all bona
fide print and electronic media (which include traditional and nontraditional media organizations
and their accredited representatives) requests to release visual information (which includes
combat camera) products when such release meets the responsibility to inform the public and it
does not compromise national security. Releasable materials are equally available to all
 20                                                        AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


interested media. Air Force stock audiovisual materials or location photography on Air Force
facilities are provided to media without charge when used for news projects.

Section 1E—Magazine and Books Support

1.40. Books. SAF/PA and its field offices are the points of contact between the Air Force and
book representatives.
   1.40.1. SAF/PA Responsibilities. The New York field office generally handles book
   activities since most publishers have major offices in that city. These responsibilities include:
       1.40.1.1. Responding to requests for available material on Air Force subjects.
       1.40.1.2. Referring requesters to MAJCOMs, field operating agencies (FOAs), and Air
       Force record centers and depositories.
       1.40.1.3. Coordinating and approving requests from authors with Letters of Intent to
       interview Air Force personnel, visit bases, and participate in media orientation flights.
   1.40.2. MAJCOM Responsibilities. SAF/PA may delegate direct liaison between Air Force
   and book representatives to the MAJCOM, FOA, or unit level (with MAJCOM or FOA
   coordination and approval) on a case-by-case basis.
       1.40.2.1. Overseas MAJCOMs and FOAs are the liaison with foreign book
       representatives covering subjects solely within their areas of responsibility. Send all
       foreign magazine and book representatives’ requests for material not available at the
       overseas location to SAF/PA for coordination, support, or concurrence. Advise overseas-
       based foreign book representatives who request to visit CONUS installations to contact
       the press office in their respective U.S. embassies. Appropriate MAJCOMs and FOAs are
       the Air Force focal points for coordination and support after approval by Office of the
       Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs (OASD/PA). PA at every level may
       support unofficial Air Force authors as they would support civilian writers and may
       review submissions for policy and technical accuracy, if requested.
1.41. National Magazine Story Ideas. Placement of solid, mission-oriented stories in the
national magazine market is a critical part of the PA mission.
   1.41.1. Without assigning production goals, MAJCOMs and FOAs should encourage PA
   offices to develop original story ideas for proposal to national and regional magazines. These
   include trade, technical, fraternal, consumer group, and industrial publications. Stories
   receive official support when they satisfy Air Force PA requirements; that is, the topic must
   be related to an operational mission on an Air Force organization, or it must directly support
   Air Force programs.
   1.41.2. All PA people are encouraged to write for national publications as part of their
   official duties. On a voluntary basis, writers may prepare articles while on official duty and
   be credited in print with a by-line. Air Force people may not accept payment for these
   articles.
   1.41.3. PAs screen story ideas for accuracy, quality, security, and policy. In addition, PA is
   responsible for quality control to ensure the final product presents a professional image.
   Contact SAF/PA for assistance in marketing, when appropriate.
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                  21


   1.41.4. PA at all levels may contact or send story ideas or articles directly to national
   magazine representatives. Inform SAF/PA of national-level media requests.
1.42. Payment and Honoraria for Writing. Air Force military and civilian professionals are
encouraged to write for publication. Air Force and civilian professionals are not allowed to
receive payment or honoraria for writing produced as part of their official duties. However, they
can accept payment and honoraria for writings that are done off duty and are unrelated to their
official duties. Consult the servicing staff judge advocate (SJA) for more information, and refer
to DOD 5500.7-R.
   1.42.1. Air Force people receive the same service from the PA office as all other writers
   when they write for profit. They must not have access to technical or operational military
   information not available to all. They must not receive payment for materials their duties
   require them to provide at no cost.
1.43. Commercial Use of Published Official Air Force Material. Official U.S. Government-
and contractor-produced unclassified Air Force manuals, symposium papers, and other
documents often provide valuable story material for publishers. Excerpts are frequently reprinted
commercially. If a publisher requests Air Force documents for this purpose, contact SAF/PAO.

Section 1F—Support for Non-Government, Non-Entertainment VI Productions

1.44. The information provided in this section is relevant to non-government VI
productions other than news. These include commercial and nonprofit industrial, institutional,
documentary, educational, and commercial enterprise productions. The key is these productions
are intended to inform.
1.45. Visual Information Guidance. Per DODI 5410.15, DOD Public Affairs Assistance to
Non-Government, Non-Entertainment-Oriented Print and Electronic Media, Air Force
assistance, access to installations, equipment, and personnel for interviews, photo and video
opportunities, and unclassified VI material may be provided when it is considered beneficial to
the Air Force and DOD and is in the national interest. See DODI 5410.15 for complete
information and guidelines.
1.46. SAF/PA Responsibilities. SAF/PA evaluates and approves support for national-level,
non-government, and non-entertainment VI productions. SAF/PA determines if the VI
production meets Air Force and DOD policy and coordinates with OASD/PA. Requests are
generally supported when they serve the Air Force interest, meet guidelines in Air Force and
DOD directives, and are not prohibited by legal or policy restrictions. When a national
production involves more than one MAJCOM, SAF/PA coordinates assistance to obtain or
produce the VI material. SAF/PA notifies the requester the project is approved, reiterates project
restrictions, and arranges for release of stock footage or puts the requester in contact with the
right PA POC.
   1.46.1. SAF/PA must approve support for VI productions involving Air Force-level
   contracts.
1.47. MAJCOM Responsibilities. MAJCOMs approve regional and local requests.
MAJCOMs review, evaluate, and determine support for VI productions judged as having
regional and local impact only. They will withhold approval until support is coordinated with
 22                                                     AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


SAF/PA if it is believed interest may expand beyond a regional audience. They also keep
SAF/PA appraised of MAJCOM-approved projects.
1.48. Unit Responsibilities. When contacted by a non-government, non-entertainment group
(other than news media) seeking VI support, units forward requests through PA channels to
MAJCOM PA with a unit recommendation, if appropriate. Provide normal PA assistance in the
form of advice or guidance. Take care to ensure no commitment of resources is made without
approval.
   1.48.1. Units approve requests for assistance from Air Force contractors when the support
   relates to contract requirements. Contract-associated support should be confirmed with the
   contract administrator. Requests relating to contractor-sponsored photography outside the
   scope of the contract must be sent through PA channels to SAF/PA.
1.49. Support Procedures.
   1.49.1. Non-Government, Non-Entertainment VI Productions Other Than News. Productions
   done by organizations outside the federal government which are primarily intended to
   inform.
      1.49.1.1. SAF/PA approves support to national-level, non-government, and non-
      entertainment visual information productions other than news media. MAJCOMs approve
      support on the local and regional level. Requesters should submit requests in writing as
      outlined below:
          1.49.1.1.1. Include detailed description of the desired material stock footage or
          photography (footage format, amount, etc.); desired receipt date (two to four weeks is
          normal processing time).
          1.49.1.1.2. If production support is requested, include anticipated specific support
          requirements, such as military manpower and equipment and projected production
          schedule, including filming dates and proposed filming locations.
          1.49.1.1.3. Provide a synopsis or explanation of the product in which the Air Force
          VI material will be used. Include a treatment, outline, script, or storyboard for the
          project.
          1.49.1.1.4. Describe the use of the product to include distribution mode and target
          audience (e.g., national TV advertisement; 30-minute TV documentary to air
          nationally on PBS; etc.).
          1.49.1.1.5. Include a statement that the requested VI support cannot be reasonably
          obtained from commercial or private sources.
          1.49.1.1.6. Provide a statement that the finished product will not imply Air Force or
          DOD sponsorship, approval, or endorsement of the organization or company, its
          products or services, nor will it state or imply Air Force or DOD support of any
          viewpoint expressed in the product.
          1.49.1.1.7. Ensure that SAF/PA (or appropriate level) will be given the opportunity
          to review the final product before release.

   1.49.2. Contractor VI Productions. These are products by Air Force and DOD contractors
   such as annual reports, corporate in-house training videos, and promotional and marketing
   productions.
      1.49.2.1. Government contracts often include VI productions that address the contract
      program. Contractors are responsible for seeking approval of their produced print and
      electronic promotional, marketing, and advertising material before public release.
      Subjects of material that require OASD/PA and SAF/PA clearance are listed in DODD
      5230.9, Clearance of DOD Information for Public Release. Material not requiring
      OASD/PA or SAF/PA clearance will be cleared at the lowest level competent to evaluate
      the information.
      1.49.2.2. Contractors seeking VI material for a production must certify in writing that
      funding of the production will not be billed to the government unless the production itself
      is being done pursuant to a government contract that authorizes such costs.
   1.49.3. Commercial Advertisements. These are requests by advertising agencies for Air
   Force materials or assistance in campaigns designed to sell a particular product, service or
   company.
      1.49.3.1. DOD is prohibited from endorsing or appearing to endorse or selectively
      benefit any particular product, company, or commercial concern. Because of this, the Air
      Force generally does not support commercial advertising unless the Air Force uses the
      product or service being advertised. The requester must show a specific tie between the
      Air Force and the advertised item. Proof can be via valid contract numbers or other
      verifiable information that shows their company does provide the advertised goods or
      services to the Air Force. Any request for Air Force support for a commercial
      advertisement must be coordinated through SAF/PA. In all cases, a proposed
      advertisement must meet the policy guidelines and the following:
      1.49.3.2. Must be factual and in good taste.
      1.49.3.3. Must be of some benefit to the Air Force (informational value, enhancement of
      public understanding, etc.)
      1.49.3.4. Must not state or imply Air Force endorsement or preference of one product
      over another. Such terms as “government approved” or “Air Force certified” must not be
      used.
      1.49.3.5. Must not compare the relative merits of current weapons or weapons systems.
      1.49.3.6. Must not refer to the economic impact of a proposed continuation or
      cancellation of a defense contract.
      1.49.3.7. Must not reproduce the Air Force seal or any of its parts, except as authorized
      by AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official Communications.
      1.49.3.8. Active-duty Air Force military and civilian personnel may not use their title or
      position to endorse commercial products, services, or activities; assume responsibility for
      advertising claims; or obtain personal gain.

Section 1G—Support for Non-Government Entertainment Productions
 24                                                     AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


1.50. Television, Motion Picture, Other Entertainment Production Guidance. This section
covers guidance governing Air Force assistance to non-government entertainment productions,
including motion pictures released via box office, DVD, and direct-to-video; television movies;
television series and mini-series, on network, cable, and syndicated television as well as
theatrical productions. These productions are primarily intended to entertain. The SAF/PA field
office in Los Angeles is the OPR for liaising with the entertainment industry on Air Force-
related projects.
   1.50.1. DOD Instruction 5410.16, DOD Assistance to Non-Government Entertainment-
   Oriented Motion Picture, Television and Video Productions, authorizes assistance to an
   entertainment-oriented motion picture, television, DVD, or video production when
   cooperation benefits DOD or when this would be in the best national interest. See DODI
   5410.16 for complete information.
1.51. Responsibilities. Pending final approval of Air Force cooperation, PA may provide
production companies information or suggestions and access to unclassified technical research.
PA must make it clear that interim help does not commit the Air Force to final approval and
official support of the project.
   1.51.1. The OASD/PA-Special Assistant for Entertainment Media serves as the sole
   authority for approving DOD assistance to non-government, entertainment-oriented motion
   picture, television, DVD and video productions. The Special Assistant for Entertainment
   Media is herein referred to as OASD/PA.
   1.51.2. SAF/PA serves as the Air Force approval authority for official support before
   elevating requests to OASD/PA for DOD-level approval. The Los Angeles field office serves
   as the entry point for all requests, reviews and coordinates support requirements with
   MAJCOMs, makes a qualifying recommendation to OASD/PA, and is ultimately charged
   with preparing, coordinating, and executing a DOD Production Assistance Agreement.
   Before a production company officially submits a project to OASD/PA, the field office may
   provide advice and courtesy assistance that might ultimately help to qualify the project for
   support. However, no premature commitments may be made. The field office also provides
   the production company a copy of DODI 5410.16.
   1.51.3. MAJCOM PA. Reviews requests and makes recommendations to the Los Angeles
   field office, to include MAJCOM and local unit ability to support. MAJCOMs ensure
   required documents are accomplished for their units before filming is allowed.
   1.51.4. Installation PA. If initially contacted by a representative from the entertainment
   industry (to include TV and motion picture companies and city and state film commission
   offices), the unit should coordinate with its MAJCOM and contact the Los Angeles field
   office in-turn before agreeing to anything. If contacted by SAF/PA or MAJCOMs concerning
   projects already under LA field office review, units should advise MAJCOMs of their ability
   to support.
   1.51.5. Production company. The production company collaborates and coordinates with the
   LA field office to develop the project ultimately for OASD/PA approval of production
   assistance by the Air Force.
1.52. Procedures for Approval and Support. Before a production company officially submits
a project to OASD/PA for support consideration, the LA field office may provide courtesy
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                  25


assistance, as in project research and development, thereby helping the production company to
develop a script that might ultimately qualify for DOD assistance.
   1.52.1. The production company must submit to OASD/PA, via the field office, a formal
   request for production assistance, which should include:
       1.52.1.1. A letter describing the proposal to produce a specific motion picture, television
       program, or video product, stating the project objectives and identifying benefits for
       DOD.
       1.52.1.2. A statement acknowledging the producer has read and agrees to abide by DODI
       5410.16.
       1.52.1.3. Five copies of the script for review and evaluation.
       1.52.1.4. A detailed list of requirements. If not yet known, requirements should be stated
       in general terms.
   1.52.2. The LA field office reviews the request and determines initial support feasibility and,
   when necessary, coordinates with appropriate Air Staff agencies and MAJCOMs. Any
   comments, changes, or problems are resolved by the field office, and recommendation for
   approval or disapproval is sent to OASD/PA.
       1.52.2.1. Support approval or disapproval will be communicated to the producer by
       OASD/PA or the LA field office.
       1.52.2.2. Once support approval is granted, if the original request submitted was not
       complete as far as final scripting or specific support requirements, these must be
       coordinated and approved by the LA field office and OASD/PA as soon as possible
       thereafter.
   1.52.3. Once a project is granted OASD/PA approval, the LA field office is authorized to
   provide official production support through an assigned project officer. The field office can
   assist with script review and rewrite, filming location arrangements, stock footage research
   and acquisition, on-site technical advice, handling of insurance and reimbursement
   arrangements, and review of completed projects.
1.53. Use of Air Force People as Extras. Air Force people who appear in non-government
entertainment-oriented productions (non-news) must do so voluntarily, whether on duty or off
duty.
   1.53.1. If they are performing normal duties during the time of the production, the Airmen
   are said to be on duty and cannot be paid by the producer, but they are not required to
   participate.
   1.53.2. If they are not performing normal duties while taking part in the production, they
   must be off duty. Military personnel in an off-duty, non-official status may be hired by the
   production company to perform as actors, extras, etc., provided there is no conflict with any
   other Air Force instruction. In such cases, contractual arrangements are solely between those
   individuals and the production company; however, payment should be commensurate with
   current industry standards. Military personnel accepting such employment shall comply with
   DODD 5500.7, Standards of Conduct.
 26                                                          AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


   1.53.3. The production company is responsible for resolving any disputes with unions
   governing the hiring of non-union actors and extras.

Section 1H—Member Participation in Non-Government Talk, Reality and Game/Quiz Shows

1.54. General Guidance. Air Force members may participate in non-government talk, reality,
and game/quiz shows given the considerations and coordination outlined below, when such
participation does not detract from the dignity and prestige of the Air Force.
   1.54.1. The following factors should be weighed in favor of participation when appropriate:
         1.54.1.1. The show is devoted mainly to observing a national holiday or is dedicated to
         the U.S. Armed Forces or a particular service.
         1.54.1.2. The show is local and originates entirely from a military installation.
         1.54.1.3. The appearance of Air Force personnel is for a purpose that has no commercial
         counterpart or that contributes to a specific Air Force interest.
         1.54.1.4. The show supports national interests.
         1.54.1.5. Members may appear when they are newsworthy in their own right or when
         appearing as an Air Force official to provide information on Air Force subjects to the
         listening or viewing audience.
         1.54.1.6. A show’s sponsors or business practices do not reflect adversely on the Air
         Force.
      1.54.2. Coordination with PA.
         1.54.2.1. A member must coordinate with his or her base-level PA office if he or she
         intends to participate either in or out of uniform, in or out of official duty status or by
         expressly presenting himself or herself as a member of the Air Force.
         1.54.2.2. The base-level PA office should in-turn inform its MAJCOM, which should in-
         turn coordinate with SAF/PA as outlined below based on the type of show.
1.55. Talk and Reality Shows. SAF/PA is the OPR for coordination and approval of an Air
Force member’s participation on a talk and reality show. Member participation is approved on a
case-by-case basis.
1.56. Participation in Commercials. Participation in endorsing or marketing any commercial
products is strictly prohibited. If necessary, SAF/PA is also the OPR for coordination of an Air
Force member’s participation and involvement in all commercials depicting any relationship
with a product and the Air Force or any Airman.
1.57. Game/Quiz Shows. The LA field office is the OPR for coordinating a member’s
participation on a game/quiz show.
   1.57.1. Military-Themed Game/Quiz Shows. When a military installation takes an active
   role in providing military contestants, approvals by the SAF/PA’s LA field office and
   OASD/PA are necessary for military members’ participation (other than as audience
   members only), whether appearing in or out of uniform. Military personnel selected as game
   or quiz show participants should be placed in a leave or other authorized off-duty status.
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                              27


  1.57.2. Non-Military Themed Game/Quiz Shows. Military personnel who independently go
  to a studio to be a member of a game or quiz show audience and have the possibility of being
  selected out of the audience for participation are encouraged to contact the LA field office
  prior to attending the event, so the LA Office is aware and can inform the military member
  which uniform (if any) is appropriate. If randomly selected, military members should inform
  their unit PA office as soon as possible, which should in-turn inform its MAJCOM and the
  LA field office.

                                            Chapter 2

                                CRISIS COMMUNICATIONS

Section 2A—Purpose, Objectives, and Planning

2.1. Purpose of Crisis Communication. Facilitating effective communication is critical during
a crisis. A crisis is a rapidly developing situation ranging from natural disasters to hostile
activities posing a threat to U.S. interests. For OASD/PA, a crisis becomes relevant when it is of
a nature that commitment of U.S. military forces and resources is contemplated in order to
respond to the situation, or where the situation directly affects military assets. PA must be ready
to implement courses of action to provide target audiences with accurate, timely, and essential
information. PA requires its trained professionals to have the skills to engage the media and to
keep a wide range of publics informed during crises.
2.2. Objectives of Crisis Communication.
   2.2.1. Establish procedures which prepare PA to handle any crisis communication issue.
   2.2.2. Provide PA rules of engagement for the proper release of information during crises.
2.3. Planning and Preparation. MAJCOMs and FOAs must prepare comprehensive PA
accident plans, or supplements to this instruction, for both nuclear and non-nuclear accidents.
These plans must include provisions for adequate personnel, administrative, communication, and
logistical support for a nuclear accident or incident Immediate Reaction Forces (IRF). Plans must
agree with AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and
Operations, which establishes requirements for local responses and AFI 91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports, that describes mishap investigation management after initial
response. MAJCOM, FOA and Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) PAs should coordinate with
SAF/PA when activating accident plans. Base-level PA offices should coordinate with the
appropriate MAJCOM PA, which will notify SAF/PA.
   2.3.1. Unclassified Information. It is Air Force policy to give the public unclassified
   information on all activities subject to the guidance in this AFI. Provide accurate and timely
   release of news--good and bad--to recognized news media. Promptly release unclassified
   facts about accidents and incidents, including near misses or missing aircraft, consistent with
   national security considerations and responsibilities.
   2.3.2. Classified Information. Federal law and Executive Order 12356, National Security
   Information, require protection of classified information. Air Force people must protect
   classified information against compromise as required. The on-scene commander, with the
   advice of the security forces representative, will provide initial guidance to the PA
   representative when it is determined classified information is involved. However, there are
   limits to Air Force authority at an accident site, particularly away from Air Force
   installations. Civilian police enforce Federal, State, and foreign criminal law.
2.4. Requirements Explained.
   2.4.1. Media Operations Center. Establish a centrally located media operations center
   (MOC), as needed, for news media representatives. Do not co-locate the media center and the
   PA office. The MOC must have the appropriate telecommunications equipment available to
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                   29


  support anticipated media representatives, plus at least one commercial line for PA personnel
  only. Consider having an additional telephone line to accommodate media requirements in
  the event cell phone use is limited.
  2.4.2. Straight Talk Line. Consider the establishment of a Straight Talk phone line to provide
  base personnel with an authoritative point of contact for current, accurate information about
  the status of any disturbance, and the command's actions. PA personnel and augmentees will
  perform such tasks as preparing fact sheets, messages for automatic telephone answering
  devices (if used), e-mail messages, straight talk web page on the intranet, and news articles
  for online and print installation newspapers. Also, make updated statements available to base
  telephone operators.
     2.4.2.1. The PA office should publicize the existence of the Straight Talk phone line both
     before and during an on-base disturbance by the command/internal information program,
     newsletters, and base bulletins.
     2.4.2.2. When available, the PA office should consider the use of answering service
     systems incorporated into installation telephone exchange facilities for the Straight Talk
     Line’s automatic answering service.
  2.4.3. First Responders. PA should be prepared to join other base emergency responders as
  part of the initial response element as determined by local procedures. These forces—
  typically fire, medical, and security members—arrive as part of the first responders to
  manage the incident and coordinate with civil authorities.
     2.4.3.1. Emergency Operations Center (EOC). For on-base accidents and incidents, a PA
     representative should be designated for incident response.
  2.4.4. National Defense Area (NDA). A NDA is the temporary establishment in the United
  States of federal areas for the protection or security of DOD resources (Title 50, United
  States Code, Section 797). If the off-base site is designated as an NDA, PA supports news
  media representatives in the same way as if they were on a military installation. Brief the
  media on appropriate disclosable information during a nuclear accident or incident and the
  procedures to be followed, such as escort requirements.
  2.4.5. Emergency Responders. PA staff members must be prepared to join base emergency
  responders as part of the follow-on forces as determined by the on-scene commander. This
  team provides enhanced command, control, and communication functions at an incident site.
  2.4.6. Jurisdiction. In the United States, PAs must respect the jurisdiction and interests of all
  concerned government agencies at national, state, and local levels to include additional
  coordination which may be required with the Departments of Justice and State, the Federal
  Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
  2.4.7. Transportation Requirements. Mobility is vital during a disturbance. The PA office
  must request sufficient vehicles and land mobile radios for on-base internal information
  program support and vehicles for media through the base disturbance contingency plan.
  Certify PA personnel to drive these vehicles, preferably prior to an incident.
  2.4.8. Additional Duties. Do not assign PA personnel to other operational duties during a
  natural disaster, on-base disturbance, crisis situation, accident, or serious incident.
 30                                                       AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


   2.4.9. Installations Without a PA office. MAJCOM and FOAs must ensure that commanders
   of units without a primary duty PAO understand the need to release accident information to
   the news media on a timely basis. The MAJCOM PA should ensure commanders have
   established notification procedures between the unit and their supporting PA office.
   2.4.10. Crisis Notification. Reports of operational incidents or events use OPREP-3. Ensure
   command post procedures exist to notify PA duty officers of known or suspected incidents or
   events. PA organizations at all levels must ensure command post notification procedures. To
   confirm notification, inform the PA duty officer at the next higher level of command of the
   incident.
   2.4.11. Overseas Precedence. When instructions or plans of a combatant command conflict
   with this instruction in procedural detail (such as naming a release authority for confirming a
   nuclear accident) or with host nation sensitivities, use the combatant command plan.
   2.4.12. Exemption from MINIMIZE. When disturbance contingency plans are implemented,
   the commander may impose MINIMIZE to reduce the flow of voice and message traffic.
   Requirements in MINIMIZE instructions must include exemption of limitation of PA voice
   and message traffic. These exemptions allow the PA office to meet the rapid response
   requirements of SAF/PA and OASD/PA.
   2.4.13. Briefing Requirement. DOD Directive 5230.16, Nuclear Accident and Incident
   Public Affairs (PA) Guidance, requires that certain military people be briefed to help them
   understand Air Force procedures for handling nuclear accidents and incidents.

Section 2B—Crisis Procedures and Release of Information

2.5. Procedures. In significant weapon system mishaps, PAs should be in place at the PA
office, the accident scene, and the installation command post.
   2.5.1. PA must ensure unit contingency plans include transportation to the accident site
   during accidents/incidents.
   2.5.2. Regardless of location, establish communication at once between the on-scene PA
   representative and those at the installation. This permits PA at the site and those at the PA
   office to coordinate information for release on a timely basis.
   2.5.3. The installation PA office must establish procedures to notify a tenant unit
   commander of any follow-on PA actions in accidents involving that commander's resources.
   2.5.4. In accidents or incidents likely to require PA support for extended periods of time, or
   likely to exceed the capabilities of the responsible PA office, PA should:
      2.5.4.1. Ask the next higher PA echelon for additional people and equipment if needed.
      2.5.4.2. Set up a 24-hour news media operations center. If other federal, state, and local
      PA response force officers are on scene, the media center should be a joint operation.
      2.5.4.3. Provide Air Force news releases about the accident to state, local, or other
      officials responsible for informing the public and media, or who needs the releases for
      any other purpose.
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                   31


       2.5.4.4. Anticipate public concerns and issues, news releases before such concerns
       distort public perceptions.
       2.5.4.5. Have each PA staff member record media and public queries on AF Form 39,
       Response to Query.
       2.5.4.6. Use a central log to record: Time of accident, important developments, time of
       releases, guidance received from higher PA echelons and how or when it was
       implemented, and thumbnail sketches of most significant queries and events.
       2.5.4.7. Alert switchboard operators to direct all news media and public calls to the
       installation PA phone line in the media operations center.
       2.5.4.8. Ensure MAJCOM and Air Force News Services are included as addressees on
       initial information release and other publicly releasable information and images.
2.6. Release of Personal Information. This section provides guidelines for the release of
personal information about victims of accidents, incidents, disturbances, and disasters. Always
consult with the local SJA before releasing personal information.
   2.6.1. Names of Survivors. Generally, release the names of all survivors as soon as possible
   in close coordination with the commander, staff judge advocate, and the medical community.
   Make releases quickly, to relieve the fears of people with kin in the accident and also to ease
   the concern of families and friends of other individuals flying similar aircraft or on similar
   duty in the vicinity. Public Affairs officers should be in constant communication with the
   local SJA in these types of instances and releasing personal information.
       2.6.1.1. If, in the judgment of the commander, releasing survivors’ names would reveal
       the identity of deceased individuals prior to NOK notification (in the case of crew
       members known by their families to customarily fly together, for example), the survivors’
       names may be withheld. Do this only when the potential for the NOK deducing their loss
       through news stories about the survivors is so strong that the circumstances clearly
       warrant leaving other families in suspense.
       2.6.1.2. Report information on survivors who are believed to be in immediate danger of
       dying as survived but in critical condition. PA must ensure releases do not invade the
       personal privacy of the victims or relatives (see AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program).
   2.6.2. Names of People Aboard Aircraft Missing or Presumed Lost. When an Air Force
   aircraft, including a contract or charter flight, is officially declared missing or crashes in a
   remote area, the PA office at the departure base will release the names of passengers and
   crew to news media individually, as the NOK are notified. This should not delay the
   announcement that the aircraft is missing.
   2.6.3. Names of Persons Admitted to Military Medical Facilities. PA should coordinate
   responses to query or news releases about the admittance or status of patients with the
   military treatment facility’s privacy officer (each location is required to have an individual
   acting in this capacity).
   2.6.4. Names of Deceased. The responsible installation PA office releases the names of
   people killed in Air Force accidents according to the following rules:
32                                                      AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


     2.6.4.1. In accordance with DODI 1300.18, Military Personnel Casualty Matters,
     Policies, and Procedures, no casualty information on deceased military personnel may be
     released to the media or the general public until 24 hours after notifying NOK regarding
     the casualty status of the member.
     2.6.4.2. When a military accident in a civilian community causes significant property
     damage or civilian loss of life, the commander may release the names of Air Force
     members killed in the accident before their NOK have been notified. This is only done
     when, in the judgment of the commander, the needs of the public outweigh any potential
     distress of the victim’s NOK. This may be necessary when the commander needs to
     immediately reassure the community the Air Force members were well qualified and
     experienced, or when civilian authorities need information on the members to identify the
     accident victims’ remains.
     2.6.4.3. Releasable information includes gender; Air Force specialty code (AFSC);
     military grade and rank; civilian grade; military base pay and all allowances except basic
     allowance for housing (BAH); civilian gross salary; current and past assignments; date of
     rank (DOR); extended active duty (EAD) date; pay date; source of commission;
     professional military education (PME); military awards and decorations; duty status,
     attendance at technical, scientific, or professional meetings; and in the case of key
     personnel, biographies and photographs.
     2.6.4.4. Non-releasable information includes home of record, home address; home
     telephone number, date of birth; marital status; number and gender of family members;
     civilian education degree and year of graduation; civilian awards; or race.
  2.6.5. Release of Information When More Than One Service Is Involved. In joint exercises
  or operations, the joint command PA is responsible for all PA actions. In all other cases, if
  circumstances permit, the parent service of the involved aircraft or vessel makes the initial
  announcement of the accident. If this is not feasible because of location or time constraints,
  any other service directly involved may assist media as necessary, including release of facts.
  The responding service must keep the parent service PA informed. Once an official statement
  is released by the parent service, other services involved may release a full description of
  their own participation, such as rescue or disaster relief activities.
     2.6.5.1. Release specific casualty information according to the military service’s
     regulations. Names and numbers of casualties are released by the service to which the
     casualties belong. When time does not permit and facts are obvious to the public, any
     other service involved in the operation may announce, when queried, only the number of
     dead, number of survivors, and number of injured. If possible, release all services’
     casualty names simultaneously.
 2.6.6. Names of Foreign Nationals. When a foreign national (other than a locally hired
 employee) is an accident casualty while under Air Force auspices, Air Force officials will not
 release the name without host nation coordination and confirmation that NOK notifications
 have taken place. When the foreign national is locally employed by a host nation agency, that
 agency’s rules take precedence. Overseas MAJCOMs must develop policy for releasing
 names of local national U.S. Air Force employees injured on duty.
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                 33


   2.6.7. Key U.S. and Foreign Government Persons. Because of national and international
   interest and implications, carefully coordinate the release of casualty information concerning
   key U.S. Government personnel or equivalent rank foreign government visitors. When the
   following key persons are killed, injured, or listed as missing while on an Air Force
   installation or traveling in an Air Force vehicle or aircraft, notify OASD/PA press desk for
   public announcement by the White House Press Secretary:
       2.6.7.1. The President of the United States
       2.6.7.2. The Vice President of the United States
       2.6.7.3. Speaker of the House of Representatives
       2.6.7.4. President Pro Tempore of the Senate
       2.6.7.5. Members of the Cabinet
       2.6.7.6. Foreign visitors of political or royal rank equivalent to the above list of U.S.
       officials, and chiefs of foreign military services
       2.6.7.7. U.S. Senators
       2.6.7.8. U.S. Representatives
       2.6.7.9. Secretaries of the Military Departments
       2.6.7.10. The Joint Chiefs of Staff
       2.6.7.11. Commanders of combatant and specified commands
       2.6.7.12. Federal Government department heads
       2.6.7.13. The installation PA office withholds casualty information on the following
       officials until OASD/PA approves: other military officers and civilian employees in the
       grades of Lieutenant General, GS-18 or NSPS equivalent, Senior Executive Service
       Precedent Priority Code DV4, and above. (SAF/PA may authorize releasing casualty
       information before securing OASD/PA approval if specific by-name queries are received.
       Only do this when OASD/PA approval is not available in time to meet immediate needs.)
       2.6.7.14. When it is necessary to telephone OASD/PA directly about releasing casualty
       information on key personnel, send an immediate confirmation message to OASD/PA
       with SAF/PA and any intermediate headquarters as information addressees. Coordinate
       with the U.S. Embassy or Consulate to ensure the host government is notified of
       accidents occurring outside the United States.

Section 2C—Controlling Photography

2.7. On U. S. Military Installations During Crises. If no classified material is exposed, the
commander will permit news media photography. PA may not release official Air Force accident
photographs that show classified information, bodies, or parts of bodies. It does not mean the
presence of bodies is in itself a reason to prohibit media photography.
   2.7.1. Classified Material. If classified information or materials are exposed and cannot be
   covered or removed immediately, media or visitors will not be allowed to photograph or
   videotape in the area. As soon as reasonably possible, the appropriate agency will cover
 34                                                         AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


   exposed classified objects and information in order to allow escorted media to photograph or
   videotape the site. The commander and PA will:
       2.7.1.1. Notify media or visitors of any restrictions with regard to what can and cannot
       be filmed in a given area or activity. Bar or restrict media and visitors from sensitive sites
       or activities.
       2.7.1.2. Immediately notify security forces of suspected photography of classified
       material by media or visitors. Security forces will ensure the images are deleted or erased
       from the individual’s photographic equipment (camera, cell phone, video recorder).
       Return camera or other device (without images) to the media or visitor. Do not detain the
       media or visitor.
           2.7.1.2.1. Coordinate closely with command officials to confirm the existence of
           classified information on the seized materials, review the coverage, and return all
           portions that do not contain classified information.
       2.7.1.3. Immediately notify the local Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)
       for its determination as to whether an AFOSI investigation is warranted if it is determined
       that:
           2.7.1.3.1. The coverage contains classified information and in some cases, AFOSI
           will develop and review the content and will handle further necessary coordination on
           processing classified information. AFOSI will review and electronically edit
           classified information from the media coverage.
           2.7.1.3.2. If it appears there was an intent to deliberately obtain coverage of
           classified information for purposes of profit, espionage or to have any other
           significant adverse impact on national security, the Air Force, base, or command,
           officials should immediately report the above actions through command channels as
           well as to OASD/PA through PA channels.
2.8. Appropriate and Professional Photography. PA is responsible for being aware of on-
and off-base photography in relation to Air Force activities. Special attention will be placed on
photography of prisoners, wounded or killed personnel.
2.9. Control of Photography at an Off-Base Location in the United States and its
Territories. The authority of PA personnel, on-scene commanders (OSCs), accident boards, and
security forces is limited in dealing with media, particularly at an accident site outside an
installation, unless it is declared a national defense area (NDA).
   2.9.1. The senior Air Force representative at the scene must find out, as soon as possible, if
   there is any identifiable classified information present.
   2.9.2. If no classified information is exposed, or if it has been covered or removed, the senior
   Air Force representative authorizes media photography. PA representatives will use
   identified safe routes to escort media to a safe viewpoint of the scene, allow photography,
   provide statements to media from cleared press releases, and coordinate all media queries, to
   include interview requests. If photography of the incident scene is not initially an option,
   consider as an interim solution allowing media to photograph and report from a checkpoint
   where emergency responders are entering.
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                      35


   2.9.3. If undetermined whether classified information is exposed, explain that fact to any
   media photographers at the scene and advise them no photography is authorized. Warn that
   taking pictures without permission may violate federal law and may identify them for future
   investigative purposes if they persist.
   2.9.4. If classified information is exposed and cannot be covered or removed, the senior Air
   Force representative must:
       2.9.4.1. Explain the situation and ask the media to cooperate.
       2.9.4.2. Explain federal law prohibits photography when official permission is expressly
       withheld (Title 18, United States Code, Sections 795 and 797).
       2.9.4.3. Do not use force if media representatives refuse to cooperate unless declared an
       NDA. If photographs are taken after a warning is issued, Air Force officials must ask
       civilian law enforcement authorities to stop further photography of the exposed classified
       information and to collect all materials with that coverage.
   2.9.5. If no civilian law enforcement authorities are on the scene and media representatives
   take unauthorized pictures, do not seize the materials or hold the photographer. Instead, the
   senior Air Force official at the scene or the responsible Air Force installation commander
   must:
       2.9.5.1. Immediately contact the managing editor or news director of the newspaper,
       magazine, or television station employing the photographer.
       2.9.5.2. Explain the situation.
       2.9.5.3. Request the return of media coverage having suspected classified information.
       2.9.5.4. Explain failure to return the material to military authorities violates federal law
       (Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793(e), 795,797).
       2.9.5.5. Review media coverage turned over to the Air Force.
       2.9.5.6. Report the action by telephone and follow-up message, when such contact is
       made, through PA channels to OASD/PA.
2.10. Liaison With Media. Accidents occurring off an installation are under state and local
authorities’ control. Officials often rope off an area to protect the public from injury or to protect
government property from further disturbance. When this is done, the OSC must coordinate
media access to the accident site with civilian officials.
   2.10.1. If possible, brief the media on safety hazards in the area and the need for preserving
   the site for investigation and consider escorting media representatives. Air Force personnel
   do not have authority to physically restrict movement of media representatives.
2.11. Control of Photography Off-Base in a Foreign Country. Air Force officials at the
scene must comply with status of forces agreements, the laws of the host nation, and other
instructions of the combatant commander responsible for that area. Overseas MAJCOM
commanders will publish supplements to this instruction that state policy on relations with media
at accident sites.

Section 2D—Aircraft, Missile and Space Accidents--Non-nuclear
 36                                                          AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


2.12. Initial News Release. Write and publicly release a news release within an hour after
notification of an accident if possible or as close to an hour after notification of the incident. The
release should include as much of the following information as possible. Note: If all the
information listed below is not available, release any available information. Sample news
releases are available on the AF PA CoP. The news release should be sent to SAF/PAO at
safpao.workflow@pentagon.af.mil in addition to local and regional media.
   2.12.1. A general description of the type of accident (crash, mid-air collision, space launch
   mishap, etc.)
   2.12.2. The time and location.
   2.12.3. The aircraft, space launch vehicles or missile’s departure/launch point and
   destination or, in the case of satellites, intended orbit (unless that information is classified or
   foreign country sensitivity precludes release).
      2.12.4. The number of crewmembers and passengers aboard.
   2.12.5. The type of aircraft, space launch vehicle/satellite or missile. Withhold this
   information if the aircraft or missile is an experimental type that has not been publicly
   announced or is on a classified mission and an exact description would reveal the nature of
   that mission. In these cases, release a general description (for example: “...an Air Force jet
   aircraft...”).
   2.12.6. Release unclassified facts about the mission the aircraft and crew were on when the
   accident occurred. Avoid non-descriptive phrases, such as “on a routine training flight.”
   Instead, describe the purpose of the flight (for example: the specific training involved) and
   give as many facts about the mission as security permits.
   2.12.7. A board of officers will investigate the accident. See paragraphs 2.14. through
   2.15.3. for guidance on answering queries about these boards’ findings and the cause of the
   accident.
   2.12.8. If an accident occurs overseas, ensure U.S. embassy coordination is obtained prior to
   release.
2.13. Accident Investigations. Commanders and PA representatives must not speculate about
the possible causes of the accident, even if the cause seems obvious. If pressed by a reporter,
explain only an accident board is qualified to determine the causes. Explain the processes for the
safety investigation board and the accident investigation board. The Safety Investigation Board
(SIB) report is not releasable. The Accident Investigation Board (AIB) report is releasable.
2.14. Safety Investigation Board. SIBs are conducted to prevent future mishaps. Safety
investigations take priority over accident investigations because of the need to quickly assess the
impact on a weapons system’s ability to fulfill its national defense role. The SIB convenes within
days of the mishap and has approximately 30 days to return its assessment. Safety investigators
are given wide-ranging freedoms to assist in quickly moving to conclusion. For example, SIBs
have the authority to take testimony under promise of confidentiality and to deliberate on causes
and recommendations without bearing a substantial burden of proof. The SIB’s conclusions
reflect the best professional judgment of the board members. SIB members are specifically
selected because of their intimate familiarity with the maintenance, operation, employment roles,
and mission of the weapon system involved in the mishap.
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                      37


   2.14.1. The SIB report is in two parts. The first part is factual and passed to the Accident
   Investigation Board to be incorporated into its report in its entirety. The second part is
   privileged, meaning it is to be used solely for mishap prevention and is restricted from
   release outside the Air Force. The privileged portion contains testimony taken under promise
   of confidentiality, private individual medical material, and a record of the SIB’s
   deliberations.
   2.14.2. If a media representative requests the SIB report, direct the representative to the
   convening authority’s PA office. Tell the requester the releasable portions of the SIB report
   are in the AIB report. If no accident investigation was conducted, media representatives may
   apply in writing to the Air Force Safety Center at AFSC/IMR, 9700 G Avenue SE, Suite
   235A, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5670, for a copy of the releasable information. Findings,
   including determination of causes and recommendations, will not be in the material released.
   Reports generally are not available until 60 to 90 calendar days after an accident.
2.15. Accident Investigation Board. The AIB is also appointed immediately after an accident
and begins its investigation as soon as it can do so without interfering with the SIB operations.
For an aircraft accident, the board president is a senior pilot, and other team members include a
maintenance expert, flight surgeon, judge advocate, and any other needed specialists. The AIB
begins its investigation by reviewing the factual information from Part 1 of the SIB report and
building on it to determine the cause of the accident. The AIB re-interviews all witnesses and
performs any additional testing required. The AIB report includes the board president’s opinion
about what caused the mishap, using a “clear and convincing evidence” standard. If there is
insufficient evidence to meet that high standard, the report will describe the factors believed to
have contributed to the accident. After the report is approved, if there are fatalities in the mishap,
the families of the deceased or any injured victims are briefed privately prior to public release.
Note: For space launch mishaps, AIBs are conducted in parallel with SIBs and do not review
Part 1 of the SIB report. This is done to ensure timely completion of space launch investigations
and release of information to the public and industry. For more information see AFI 51-503,
Aerospace Accident Investigations.
   2.15.1. The AIB report is releasable to the public. The report is completed and released in
   approximately 60 to 90 days. This timeline allows for technical review, coordination, and
   approval by the convening authority (usually a MAJCOM commander) and a briefing to
   family members and any injured victims, if applicable. If a press briefing is held, the AIB
   president usually serves as the Air Force spokesperson and is available to answer questions.
   2.15.2. Requests for accident information should be referred to the convening authority’s PA
   office. The convening authority is the MAJCOM to which the weapon system is assigned.
   For Air National Guard units, the AIB is handled by the gaining active-duty command.
   Copies of the AIB report in its entirety can be obtained from the Air Force Safety Center.
   Note: AFSC's mailing address is at paragraph 2.14.2.
   2.15.3. Coordinate with MAJCOM PA for local release (community in which the weapon
   system and/or personnel were assigned) of the AIB report’s Executive Summary.

Section 2E—Disturbances
 38                                                         AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


2.16. On-Base Disturbances. Disturbances, such as protests and marches, due to social,
political, or economic unrest, can occur on any Air Force installation. PA must ensure their
actions do not aggravate the existing situation. PA also must ensure all PA actions are in close
coordination with security forces activities. In overseas areas, ensure PA activities during on-
base disturbances conform to policies and directives established by the combatant or specified
commander and the country team.
   2.16.1. Release Authority. The local commander is the release authority. HHQ may issue PA
   guidance. See Chapter 1, Media Operations, for media guidance. Sample news releases are
   available on the AF PA CoP.
         2.16.1.1. (Added-AU) Protests or confrontations at AFROTC detachments. A Public
         Affairs Plan for Protests or Confrontations at AFROTC detachments is provided as
         Attachment 2.
   2.16.2. Commander's Responsibilities.
         2.16.2.1. Adequately staff the PA office to provide required support during a
         disturbance, including authorized augmentation where needed, to assist PA personnel.
         2.16.2.2. Meet with internal and external media when needed.
         2.16.2.3. Approve a message for the Straight Talk Center's telephone answering
         machine, e-mail and web site, as applicable.
         2.16.2.4. Conduct on-base town hall meetings or other open forums to allay fears and
         address concerns of non-participants and to help stabilize the situation.
      2.16.3. PA Responsibilities.
         2.16.3.1. Develop Situation Reports (SITREPs). Send SITREPs to MAJCOM PA as
         warranted. Continue reporting during emergency conditions using priority precedence.
         Continue reporting during MINIMIZE. SITREPs include:
             2.16.3.1.1. Base facilities involved and how affected.
             2.16.3.1.2. Number of military personnel involved, both as participants in the
             disturbance and as members of the control force or in support of the control forces.
             2.16.3.1.3. Number of PA augmentation personnel requested or in place.
             2.16.3.1.4. Assessment of impact to on-base personnel, including information about
             previous similar incidents.
             2.16.3.1.5. PA actions already taken and known or anticipated media interest.
         2.16.3.2. Deploy to Disturbance Area. PA will deploy a person (or persons) with the on-
         scene response force to provide liaison between the disturbance area and the PA office.
         2.16.3.3. Activate, operate, and update the Straight Talk line, e-mail and web page as
         applicable.
         2.16.3.4. Conduct media operations.
             2.16.3.4.1. Activate and operate Media Operations Center, if appropriate.
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                     39


           2.16.3.4.2. Respond to local media. Release information about the crisis as soon as it
           is available.
           2.16.3.4.3. Initial News Release. The initial news release should include the nature
           and background of the disturbance, numbers of personnel involved, damage or injury
           estimates, command actions, and a statement that the cause is being investigated.
           2.16.3.4.4. Escort Media.
               2.16.3.4.4.1. Before taking media representatives to the disturbance area, brief
               them on the current situation, base organizations involved, and any possible risks
               of personal harm.
               2.16.3.4.4.2. Issue a media badge. Coordinate with the security forces to ensure
               they recognize the badge. Note that media representatives are not allowed beyond
               the disturbance cordon perimeter, if established, or the edge of the disturbance.
       2.16.3.5. After-Action Report. Provide an after-action report to MAJCOM PA within
       seven days after the end of the disturbance. Report should contain a chronology of PA
       actions, problems encountered, community and media relations activities, and lessons
       learned.
2.17. Chemical or Biological Material. If an accident or incident involves chemical or
biological material, release information according to AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency
Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations. The release must also comply with more
specific instructions given in movement and operations plans or orders and DOD or overseas
combatant command policies that apply.
2.18. Terrorism. Because terrorists seek media recognition, media information management
must be in the best interest of the hostage if any and the situation. PA screens information
disseminated to the media to ensure operational security and force protection and provides
communication advice and counsel to those in charge. In general, statements may include U.S.
policy that terrorist acts are criminal, that the U.S. Government will make no concessions to
terrorists, that ransom will not be paid, and that nations fostering terrorism will be identified and
isolated. In response to a possible or real terrorist threat, the PA representative may
acknowledge, if appropriate, that increased security measures have been taken (without going
into specific detail). PA may also confirm the obvious. Requests for coverage of counter
terrorism forces will not be approved. In overseas areas, coordinate announcements with the U.S.
Embassy and combatant command PA. Queries or requests for information or photography
beyond the above guidance must be referred to OASD/PA.
2.19. Near Mid-Air Collision. In case of a near mid-air collision that is of more than local PA
significance, advise HHQ PA of the details and the PA situation. Include any actual or proposed
responses to queries. MAJCOMs and FOAs should consider whether SAF/PA should be advised.
Responses to news media queries at any level should be coordinated with the appropriate FAA
office.

Section 2F—Nuclear Weapons

2.20. Policy for Information Releases After Nuclear Accidents and Incidents. DOD policy
is to establish efficient and effective procedures for release of information to the public in the
 40                                                         AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


event of nuclear accidents or incidents. However, procedures must be consistent with the policy
of neither confirming nor denying the presence or absence of nuclear weapons at any specific
location.
2.21. U. S. Initial Public Affairs Responsibility. In the United States and its territories and
possessions, OASD/PA retains initial PA responsibility for nuclear weapon accidents and
significant incidents. In overseas areas, combatant commanders, in coordination with OASD/PA,
have this responsibility, with the exception of losses, thefts, or seizures.
2.22. Neither Confirm Nor Deny (NCND). The presence of nuclear weapons or radioactive
nuclear weapon components at any specified location must not be confirmed or denied, except
for the following exemptions.
   2.22.1. Exception for Public Safety. In the interest of public safety in the United States and
   its territories and possessions, confirmation of nuclear weapons or radioactive nuclear
   weapon components may be made by any OSC. The deputy director of operations of the
   National Military Command Center (NMCC) also may invoke this exception to policy before
   the OSC arrives, based on available information and coordination with the Air Force Chief of
   Staff or designee. Notify public authorities in a timely, candid manner to enable them to take
   public safety actions. Notification is required if the public is or may be in danger of radiation
   exposure or any other danger posed by the nuclear weapon or radioactive nuclear weapon
   component. Make confirmation promptly when protective action or evacuation of civilians
   may be required. These actions may include releasing statements to news media to expedite
   public safety procedures. Advise SAF/PA and OASD/PA as soon as practicable when
   confirmation is made directly by the OSC or the deputy director of operations of the NMCC.
   2.22.2. Exception To Prevent Public Alarm. To reduce or prevent widespread public alarm
   in the United States and its territories and possessions, the OSC may issue an official
   statement of reassurance to the public that confirms or denies the presence of nuclear
   weapons or radioactive nuclear weapon components. Before the OSC arrives, the deputy
   director of operations of the National Military Command Center (NMCC) may invoke this
   exception to policy with available information and in coordination with the Air Force Chief
   of Staff, or designee. An official confirmation should be accompanied by appropriate
   assurances, such as that the chance of injury from high explosive detonation or potential
   exposure to radiation is highly unlikely. The confirmation also may state that use of
   explosive ordnance disposal teams and evacuation of military personnel is only a protective
   measure to limit the number of personnel at the accident site. A denial should characterize
   the accident or incident as a non-nuclear event. Notify SAF/PA and OASD/PA in advance if
   practical, or as soon as practicable thereafter if this exception to policy is initiated to enable
   OASD/PA and SAF/PA to continue initial PA responsibilities and ensure release of timely,
   accurate information at the national level.
   2.22.3. Overseas. In overseas areas other than the United States and its territories and
   possessions, combatant commanders, with concurrence of the host government through the
   Chief of the U.S. Mission, may officially confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons or
   radioactive nuclear weapon components at the scene of an accident or significant incident in
   the interest of public safety or to reduce public alarm. Advise SAF/PA and OASD/PA, in
   advance if practical, if exception to policy is necessary. Inform civil authorities through the
   Chief of the U.S. Mission of an accident or significant incident involving nuclear weapons or
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                      41


   radioactive nuclear weapon components in countries where international agreements require
   this information. Should a nuclear mishap occur in a country that requires public
   announcement either for public safety or to ease public alarm where PA coordination
   procedures are not established, the combatant commander or designee coordinates the
   announcement with the host government through the Chief of the U.S. Mission.
2.23. Release of Information. Information about any nuclear accident that does not cause a
public hazard or undue public alarm must not be released without OASD/PA approval. In event
of losses, seizures, or thefts of nuclear weapons, materials, or components by terrorists or other
dissident groups, or in the case of seizures of nuclear storage sites or any site or location having a
nuclear weapon or nuclear weapon system, release of information must be approved in advance
and handled by OASD/PA. However, this does not apply in overseas areas where governmental
agreements exist for the release of this information. Terrorist activities on or near an Air Force
installation are considered a special case of civil disturbance rather than an accident. For general
policies on release of information, see Chapter 1, Media Operations.
   2.23.1. Procedures for Release After Nuclear Accidents and Incidents. Within the United
   States and its territories and possessions, the responsible commander must:
       2.23.1.1. Require the on-scene PAO to contact SAF/PA by the most expeditious means.
       Phone numbers are DSN 225-0640 or commercial (703) 695-0640. During non-duty
       hours, contact the Air Force Operations Center, DSN 227-6103 or commercial (703) 697-
       6103 and ask for the SAF/PA duty officer.
       2.23.1.2. If action has not been taken by Federal Emergency Management Agency
       (FEMA) or the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a joint information center (JIC),
       establish one near the accident site. Make sure all public information is coordinated at the
       JIC before release.
       2.23.1.3. Direct the release of basic accident or incident information without reference to
       nuclear material. See sample news releases on the AF PA CoP.
       2.23.1.4. If needed, direct the preparation of a proposed follow-up release that is more
       specific to the situation that involves nuclear weapons, components, or radioactive
       materials and any conventional high explosives. If the mishap causes a public hazard or
       undue public alarm, the responsible OSC issues the release on his or her own authority. If
       there is no public hazard or alarm, OASD/PA approval is required for confirmation or
       denial of the presence of nuclear material.
       2.23.1.5. Notify HHQ and obtain OASD/PA approval of the proposed follow-on release.
       Both telephonic and message notifications are required.
       2.23.1.6. Coordinate all further releases and proposed responses to queries that go
       beyond the scope of previously approved releases with appropriate members of the JIC or
       through PA channels to OASD/PA if the JIC has not been formed.
           2.23.1.6.1. Community Emergency Action Team (CEAT). When key local officials
           and civilian and state officials are informed of an accident or significant incident
           where radiation and other hazards may exist, direct a CEAT be formed by the JIC.
           The CEAT may include PA, medical, legal, security, communications, administrative,
           logistics, and other appropriate personnel. As these resources become available, they
42                                                       AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


         function under the direction of the OSC and are physically located in the JIC to
         facilitate coordination.
         2.23.1.6.2. Coordinate CEAT activities through the senior federal official (SFO) and
         with other agency PA activities to ensure a unified approach to working with the
         community. For military nuclear reactor or radiological accidents, state and local
         officials may be informed by FEMA in the United States and its territories and
         possessions.
     2.23.1.7. Acknowledge the presence of nuclear weapons, components or radioactive
     materials, as soon as possible, if the accident or incident causes a public hazard or undue
     public alarm.
     2.23.1.8. Avoid talking about nuclear weapons or materials, beyond the scope of the
     above guidance, unless authorized by OASD/PA.
     2.23.1.9. Ensure the OSC or PA designee establishes communication with OASD/PA
     immediately if an accident or incident requires implementing public safety measures.
     Direct communication between the OSC’s PA representative and OASD/PA ensures
     appropriate coordination of PA policy matters and provides timely, accurate information
     for public release at the national level until the Air Force service response force (SRF)
     takes responsibility for PA at the scene. Response task forces are provided by Air Force
     Space Command (AFSPC) for Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) accidents within
     CONUS, Air Combat Command (ACC) for all CONUS non-ICBM nuclear weapons
     accidents, or the responsible command or component designated by current service
     policy. Note: Command responsibility of ICBM units transfer from AFSPC to Air Force
     Global Strike Command (AFGSC) 1 Dec 2009, and command responsibility of CONUS
     non-ICBM nuclear-capable units transfers from ACC to AFGSC 1 Feb 2010.
  2.23.2. MAJCOM Nuclear Accident Planning. PAs for MAJCOMs possessing, storing, or
  transporting nuclear weapons, or supporting nuclear-capable units should prepare sample PA
  annexes that can be tailored by the installation PA office. MAJCOMs and FOAs must guide
  subordinate units, describing what additional supplements or annexes are needed in support
  of accident or incident plans.
     2.23.2.1. Briefing Requirement. DOD Directive 5230.16, Nuclear Accident and Incident
     Public Affairs (PA) Guidance, requires that certain military and civilian people at or near
     a nuclear-capable installation be briefed to help them understand Air Force procedures
     for handling nuclear accidents or incidents. However, since there is usually intense local
     public interest in any Air Force aircraft accident, PAs should consider expanding this
     briefing to cover aircraft accident procedures in general as well as specific installation
     issues.
         2.23.2.1.1. DODD 5230.16 requires commanders to brief military and civil law
         enforcement, disaster response, nuclear weapons security force, intelligence and
         operations officials at least once a year. Areas discussed should include security, base
         plans, policies, and laws. While face-to-face meetings and briefings are preferred,
         PAOs have the option, if conditions warrant, to provide the required information
         through by-name letters, videotapes, or handouts. The sensitive nature of nuclear
         accidents and incidents requires PA, disaster preparedness, and security forces
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                                 43


           officials to conduct active PA and education programs with their civilian community
           counterparts. See DODD 5230.16 for details regarding annual briefings and meetings.

  PUBLIC AFFAIRS PLAN FOR PROTESTS OR CONFRONTATIONS AT AFROTC
                           DETACHMENTS

A2.1. (Added) Purpose: This plan provides guidelines for AFROTC detachment cadre to
follow during protests and acts of civil disobedience at college/university campuses across the
country.
A2.2. (Added)Key Themes:
   A2.2.1. (Added) We will successfully balance the needs of the mission with the
   constitutional rights of those who peacefully assemble.
   A2.2.2. (Added) The Air Force recognizes the right of assembly and free speech, but we
   also recognize our responsibility to safeguard lives and government property, and to continue
   to perform our mission.
   A2.2.3. (Added) We do not seek confrontation, but will take any necessary steps to protect
   valuable resources.
A2.3. (Added) Key Messages:
   A2.3.1. (Added) The U.S. Air Force has always been and continues to be committed to
   defending lawful freedom of speech and expression. However, anyone who unlawfully enters
   AFROTC detachment property without the express permission of the AFROTC detachment
   commander or university officials will be detained and turned over to local law enforcement
   authorities.
   A2.3.2. (Added) People are our most valuable resource. It is our responsibility to take the
   necessary actions to protect our people, as well as our assets.
   A2.3.3. (Added) AFROTC is committed to preparing the nation’s finest young men and
   women to assume leadership roles in the military.
A2.4. (Added) Assumptions:
   A2.4.1. (Added) The protest may be loud, confrontational and confusing.
   A2.4.2. (Added) The protest will attract news media attention.
   A2.4.3. (Added) The situation has the potential for negative media reporting.
   A2.4.4. (Added) Demonstrators may become belligerent in order to antagonize law
   enforcement personnel.
   A2.4.5. (Added) Some demonstrators may pose as media representatives and may in fact
   have credentials identifying them as media.
   A2.4.6. (Added) Spectators may be on-scene to watch the protest.
   A2.4.7. (Added) The protest could escalate into a violent confrontation if protestors try to
   get inside the buildings or harm law enforcement personnel or spectators.
A2.5. (Added) Actions to be Taken Before the Protest:
    50                                                              AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011


      A2.5.1. (Added) Advise AFROTC Headquarters THROUGH your region commander
      regarding all suspected protests/confrontations. Follow guidance from AFROTC
      Headquarters regarding wear of uniforms by cadets/cadre and protection of resources.
      A2.5.2. (Added) Notify AU/PA when coordinating with Headquarters.
      A2.5.3. (Added) Work with campus police/university officials on handling protests. Take
      all steps necessary to protect cadets/cadre and administrative offices/equipment.
A2.6. (Added) Proposed Questions and Answers. In the event of an advertised disturbance
or protest against AFROTC detachments, the following questions and answers should be used to
answer possible media queries. Remember, the following questions are generic in nature and can
be modified to fit the situation.

Table A2.1. (Added) Proposed Questions and Answers.


         QUESTION                                            ANSWER

1        Why are these people protesting?                    I will refer you to the protestors on all questions
                                                             relating to their motives, goals and agenda.

2        Will they be allowed to protest on the university   I will refer you to university officials on
         campus?                                             questions relating to demonstrations on
                                                             campus.

3        Will you meet with/negotiate with the leader of     Campus security and local law enforcement
         the demonstration/protest?                          agencies are in contact with the local groups
                                                             and have told them at what point they'd be
                                                             breaking the law. There is no room for
                                                             negotiation on what they've already been told.

4        How will this demonstration/protest affect your     Unless safety and/or security concerns dictate
         daily operations?                                   (putting anybody in danger), daily operations
                                                             should not be affected by the
                                                             demonstration/protest.

5        What are the Air Force’s views about the            As long as the protestors/demonstrators remain
         protestors?                                         outside the university buildings we respect their
                                                             right to demonstrate. It's the constitutional
                                                             right of any American citizen to peaceably
                                                             assemble and petition for a redress of
                                                             grievance. The U.S. military is pledged to
                                                             protect that right.

6        May I interview one of your cadets about the        Until this situation is over, all of our personnel
AFI35-104_AUSUP_I 26 MAY 2011                                                 51


   protest?                     are unavailable for interviews--they are busy

                                them in respect to this incident. However, after
                                the situation has been resolved, you can work
                                through our Public Affairs office and request an
                                interview. Senior AFROTC leadership will
                                determine if an interview is appropriate.
