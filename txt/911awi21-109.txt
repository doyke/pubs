This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-1, Air and Space
Maintenance. The purpose of this instruction is to establish procedures for 911th Airlift Wing
aircraft with hot brakes. These procedures may also be used for transient C-130 aircraft (except
LC-130 aircraft). For other transient aircraft ( including LC-130 aircraft), the following
procedures may be used in whole or in part only under close coordination with flight crew,
emergency response personnel, maintenance supervision, and a sound Operational Risk
assessment. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management
System       (AFRIMS)       Records      Disposition       Schedule      (RDS)       located      at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rds/rds_series.cfm.”             Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
using Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms
847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. See Attachment 1

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction establishes procedures for 911th Airlift Wing aircraft with hot brakes.

1. Responsibilities. Maintenance supervisors and maintenance personnel are responsible for
ensuring strict compliance with this instruction.
2. Procedures:
     2.1. Should the ground crew discover an aircraft has hot brakes upon arrival or other report
     from flight crew members, place chocks around nose landing gear tires, ensure brakes are
     released (to facilitate cooling) and evacuate the area immediately. Notify the Fire
     Department and follow remaining procedures in this instruction as applicable. Note: If the
     flight crew suspects or is otherwise informed of hot brakes by any other means during taxi
     operations, they should follow any and all emergency guidance or procedures. When the
     aircraft is in movement within the confines of the 911th Airlift Wing (AW) ramp, the aircraft
     should proceed to Hotspot 1 parking location (Attachment 2, Airfield Diagram). If ground
     maintenance is dispatched to the aircraft at any point within the airfield, the following
     procedures will remain in effect.
     2.2. On arrival, the Fire Department will verify the hot brake condition. If the Fire
     Department is unable to verify a hot brake condition, the brakes will be considered hot.
     Personnel will evacuate the area within a 300 foot radius of the aircraft as a minimum. Fire
     Department, On-Scene Commander, and/or Maintenance Supervision will notify
     maintenance personnel when to approach aircraft.          Warning: The area on either side
     (inboard and outboard) of an overheated wheel must be clear of personnel and equipment for
     at least 300 feet. Due to the possibility of a wheel explosion, all personnel must remain clear
     of the aircraft for at least 30 minutes after the brakes have sufficiently cooled. Under no
     circumstances approach the aircraft without permission from the fire department and
     concurrence of designated maintenance supervisor or other designated On-Scene
     Commander.
     2.3. Once the aircraft engines are shut down, maintenance must wait 30 minutes after the
     brakes have sufficiently cooled before any maintenance action. Maintenance will consist of a
     qualified tow crew with tow bar and vehicle. Repair/Reclamation (RR) personnel and/or
     Crashed, Damaged or Disabled Aircraft Repair (CDDAR) personnel(when available) to
     determine serviceability of wheels and brakes in accordance with Technical Order ( T.O.)
     4B-l-l, Use of Landing Gear Wheel Brakes and Wheels During Ground Operations and 4W1-
     4-1013, Overhaul with Part Breakdown for Main Landing Gear Wheel.
     2.4. After brakes have sufficiently cooled, approach from forward or aft of landing gear.
     After brakes, wheels, and tires have been inspected and found safe to tow, crew chiefs or
     other qualified maintenance personnel may tow the aircraft as required.
        2.4.1. The following documentation will be annotated in the AFTO 781A, Maintenance
        Discrepancy and Work Document. Document the initial discrepancy of hot brake(s),
        detailing the specific gear and brake affected, under a Red X symbol. Document an
        inspection due under a Red Dash, of the affected brake and refer to the original
        discrepancy. Document any subsequent findings as required in accordance with TO 00-
911AWI21-109 10 NOVEMBER 2014                                                           3


     20-1. Clear the original Red X discrepancy with the corrective action after all other
     maintenance actions are complete in accordance with TO 00-20-1.
