                                INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE
1.1. Introduction. Federal agencies to include the Department of Defense and all services
(including Army and Air Force) are directed to implement an Environmental Management
System (EMS) at all appropriate agency facilities based on facility size, complexity, and the
environmental aspects of facility operations. Fort Eustis is a designated appropriate facility. The
facility EMS shall include annually reviewed and updated measurable environmental goals,
objectives, and targets. EMS performance measures shall be incorporated in agency facility
audit protocols.

    1.1.1. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Environment, Safety and Occupational
Health) Action Memorandum on EMS; and Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Installations,
Environment and Logistics) direct installations to use the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) EMS, known as ISO 14001, to manage the environmental program. This
international standard, ISO 14001: 2004 provides elements of an effective EMS that can be
integrated with other management requirements to assist Fort Eustis in achieving its
environmental goals, mission requirements, and economic efficiencies. The ISO 14001:2004
standard, as other international standards, ISO 9001, Quality Management, and ISO 18001,
Safety and Health Management, uses the Plan-Do-Check-Act management methodology as
follows:

1.2. Approach. The installation will use an ISO 14001:2004-based, mission-focused EMS to
manage all aspects of the environmental program: compliance, prevention, conservation, and
restoration. The EMS sets the general management requirements and PLANNING guidelines,
establishes environmental roles and responsibilities for all personnel, identifies legal, training,
and documentation requirements, and establishes procedures to control, DO, monitor, and
CHECK all environmental media programs. The EMS also establishes requirements and
procedures for senior leadership and managers to review the EMS performance and ACT to
continually improve environmental stewardship and sustainability of the facility. A robust EMS
is the key tool to achieve a sustainable installation. Sustainability is the ability to achieve
continuing economic prosperity while protecting the natural systems of the planet and providing
a high quality of life for its people. For the Air Force, sustainability is critical if it is to continue
its mission to train and deploy its forces.

SAS. The ASD must be assigned to a container of Universal Waste when UWs are first added to
the container or the container is issued by the HWAF. Once the ASD is placed on a container, it
cannot be changed. The “shell game” of moving a container from one accumulation area to
another or re-containerizing the hazardous or universal waste does not restart the ASD. Do not
falsify the ASD.

methods of open burning or open detonation (OBOD), which are considered a means of
treatment for WMM.

Detonation—As relating to open detonation, detonation is a violent chemical reaction within a
chemical compound or mechanical mixture evolving heating and pressure. A detonation which
proceeds through the reacted material toward the un-reacted at a supersonic velocity. The result
of the chemical reaction is exertion of extremely high pressure in the surrounding medium
forming a propagating shock wave that originally is of supersonic velocity.

110 gallons in size. No more than 0.3% by weight of the total capacity of the container remains
in the container or inner liner if the container is greater than 110 gallons in size. Wastes removed
IAW above are usually from closed-top, closed-head, or non-removable top containers. Wastes
removed from open top or removable tops should have less than the quantities listed above, e.g.,
paint residue bonded to the container, which cannot be removed by normal scraping. A
container, which has held a compressed gas, is empty when the pressure in the container is at
atmospheric pressure and valve stem has been removed or holes have been made in the container
to prevent reuse. This includes aerosol cans. A container or an inner liner removed from a
container that once held an acutely hazardous waste is empty if: The container or inner liner has
been triple rinsed using a solvent capable of removing the commercial chemical product or
manufacturing chemical intermediate; or the container or inner liner has been cleaned by another
method that has been shown in the scientific literature, or by tests conducted by the generator, to
achieve equivalent removal; or in the case of a container, the inner liner that prevented contact of
