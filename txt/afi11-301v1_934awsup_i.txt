SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is a major revision and must be reviewed entirely. It includes initial guidance for the new
Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) career field (AFSC 1P0X1), which includes and merges the
former Aircrew Life Support (AFSC 1T1X1) and Survival Equipment (AFSC 2A7X4) career
fields. It modifies MAJCOM and other agency responsibilities, and updates office symbols.
Life Support Officers (LSO) are referred to as Flight Equipment Officers (FEO). Previous
guidance relating to Mobility, CBRN, and contingency operations has been moved to AFI 11-
301, Volume 3, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Combat Operations, (forthcoming).

Program Guidance Letter (PGL), Aircrew Life Support and Survival Equipment Career
Field Merger, dated 12 March 2008 implemented the Chief of Staff of the Air Force direction
to merge these two career fields, and created a new AFE (AFSC 1P0X1) career field with all
functions, manpower, and personnel organizationally aligned to the Operations Support
Squadron (OSS) under the Operations Group (OG) to include all military, civil service, and
contractor equivalent. A copy of this PGL can be obtained from HQ USAF/A3O-AT
(Operational Training Division).

                                            Chapter 1

                                          OVERVIEW

1.1. Mission. Provide USAF aircrew safe and effective aircrew flight equipment and programs
to increase aircrew performance. Protect and sustain human life during flight operations.
Prepare aircrew and passengers to survive, affect their rescue, and return to duty if forced to
abandon their aircraft during an emergency. Provide aircrew protection from effects of
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons.
1.2. Program Objectives:
     1.2.1. Increase combat capability of the total weapon system by enhancing and maximizing
     the performance and survivability of the aircrew.
     1.2.2. Reduce injuries and increase survival rates by providing aircrew and passengers with
     the best equipment available through new technologies, system training, and quality system
     maintenance.
     1.2.3. Identify requirements for modernization and new equipment by analyzing: customer-
     validated operational requirements, operational deficiencies, USAF suggestions and
     recommendations, Air Force Technical Order (TO) improvement reports, aircraft mishap
     investigation and safety report recommendations, and joint developmental programs from
     other Department of Defense (DoD) agencies.
     1.2.4. Train aircrew and passengers to use their Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) in a
     manner that reinforces recall during emergency situations. Training should be accomplished
     using training equipment that mirrors operational equipment and realistic scenarios, in which
     aircrew and passengers are likely to encounter. Realistic training will ensure aircrew and
     passengers have confidence in their equipment and increase their ability to use it.
     1.2.5. Train and qualify AFE personnel (Air Force Specialty Code [AFSC] 1P0X1) to
     maintain AFE in optimum condition and to conduct Aircrew Flight Equipment Continuation
     Training (AFECT). Provide units the suitable resources to perform optimal equipment
     maintenance.
     1.2.6. Conduct aircraft mishap safety investigations and analysis where AFE is involved

                            AFE PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

3.1. Purpose. This chapter provides guidance to assist AFE personnel in administering key
areas necessary for effective management of the AFE program.
3.2. Budgeting:
   3.2.1. Each AFE activity must use established DoD and USAF budgeting procedures to
   ensure their AFE programs are properly funded.
   3.2.2. Each AFE activity will prepare and submit a detailed annual budget and financial plan
   to their appropriate commanders and resource advisors. Submit unfunded requirements
   during mid-year and end-of-year calls IAW MAJCOM procedures.
3.3. Supply Accounts:
   3.3.1. The OSS AFE section will budget for and establish their own supply account as
   specified by AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 13, Chapter 8.
   3.3.2. When appropriate, local contingency plans will include qualified AFE technicians
   who will assume supply custodial responsibilities at deployed AFE locations.
   3.3.3. Ensure custodians receive base supply customer training as needed IAW AFMAN 23-
   110, Supply Manual, Volume 2, Part 13, and the Education and Training Course
   Announcements (ETCA) site at: https://etca.randolph.af.mil/.
   3.3.4. Develop procedures to track supply, equipment and clothing expenditures so as to
   provide quantitative requirements to the unit commander and resource manager to assist in
   and justify budgeting and funding requirements.
   3.3.5. To ensure/justify equipment authorizations, units will maintain a current printed copy
   of the TORC screen for each NSN. This product will be used as the configuration data
   resume list. Refer to AFH 170-1, Resource Manager’s Handbook (projected to be AFPAM
   65-605).
   3.3.6. Ensure applicable Force Activity Designators (FAD) code is used when requisitioning
   AFE. When ordering time-change items, use TEX Code 8 to by-pass base level stock (if
   remaining service-life is inadequate to meet mission needs) and advice code “2G” to ensure
   assets received from depot have the most service-life remaining on item.
   3.3.7. Report time-change component requirements IAW TO 00-20-9 and HHQs directives.
   AFRC associate units will provide information copies to their respective AFRC NAF.
   3.3.8. Use AS 538, AS 450, AS 660, aircraft configuration instructions, mission
   requirements, Logistics Details (LOGDET), AFEMS, MAJCOM specific guidance and this
   instruction to determine the basis of equipment required.

   3.4.1. Aircraft AFE components either on or off aircraft, to include prepositioned, used
   solely for flying operations are included as part of the CPFH program. In addition, aircrew
   equipment (other than uniforms and personal items are CPFH expenses. To purchase these
   items, use EEIC 644 for Materiel Support Division (MSD) items, EEIC 605 for General
   Support Division (GSD) items, and EEIC 61952 for Government Purchase Card (GPC)
   items. Units should use the most recent FY standardized CPFH RC/CC and PFMR/ORG
   codes applicable to their unit. Equipment items are not funded through the CPFH program.
   3.4.2. AFE and A4 AFCAIG/CPFH managers will identify and define, (by decision-tree
   method), total aircrew performance program AFCAIG/CPFH requirements for each MDS
   aircraft configuration within the command that adhere to HAF and MAJCOM guidance.
   Items not passing the decision-tree method for AFCAIG/CPFH AFE funding will be
   considered non-fly items.
3.5. Equipment Redistribution. In the event AFE becomes excess to organizational needs, the
AFE superintendent will notify respective MAJCOM, ANG, or NAF FMs for possible
redistribution prior to turn-in.
3.6. Transfer of AFE:

   3.7.4. Maintain a two-person concept when servicing equipment requiring IPI(s) to include
   at least one certified 1P0X1 technician and one IPI certified 1P071 (or equivalent). The IPI
   certified 1P071 will be present during accomplishment of the IPI tasks associated with the
   equipment. Only the person(s) performing the inspection, repack, and repair will annotate
   the parachute logs and records. The IPI inspector will annotate the appropriate locally
   developed IPI checklist.
   3.7.5. The original technician (inspector) will correct all discrepancies prior to the piece of
   equipment being placed back in service.
   3.7.6. Monitor QC documentation (e.g., AF IMT 2420, Quality Control Inspection
   Summary, or equivalent) to identify positive and negative trends. Provide QC documentation
   to the AFE QA function monthly or earlier if a negative trend is identified.
   3.7.7. AFE personnel certified to clear “Red-X” discrepancies will be annotated on the
   automated SCR, designated by unit commander via appointment letter for units that do not
   have access to an automated SCR, or as determined by applicable MAJCOM and ANG.
   AFE “Red-X” certified personnel will be a 1P071 (or equivalent). The first O-6 in the chain
   of command may waive the 7-level requirement for a SSgt (E-5) or SrA (E-4) to clear “Red-
   X” discrepancies based on their experience and technical expertise; such a waiver will
   terminate once a sufficient quantity of 7-levels are available.
3.8. Composite Tool Kit (CTK) Program. The objectives of the CTK program are to prevent
and eliminate Foreign Object Damage (FOD) to aircraft, engines, missiles, training and support
equipment, and to reduce tool cost through effective control of assets.
   3.8.1. Establish a CTK and lost tool procedure program to control and account for tools used
   in each AFE section IAW AFI 21-101, Chapter 10, and AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 13,
   Chapter 8, as well as MAJCOM, and wing/unit directives.
NOTE: AFE sections are authorized to manually track all their CTKs, or ALERTS is authorized
as well for AFE sections to track their CTKs. AFE sections are not required to use the
automated Tool Accountability System (TAS). Units will develop local tracking procedures that
will include quantity of serviceable/unserviceable oxygen connectors dispatched to and from the
flightline (if applicable).
   3.8.2. Each tool, item of equipment, or consumable contained in a CTK has an assigned
   location identified either by inlay cuts in the shape of the item, shadowed layout, or
   silhouette. No more than one item is stored in a cutout, shadow, or silhouette except for tools
   issued in sets such as drill bits, allen wrenches, apexes, or paired items (e.g., gloves, booties).
   NOTE: Personal tools are NOT authorized on the flightline or in any maintenance area. (e.g.,
   Mini-Mag type flashlights, Leatherman type multi-tools, buck knives).
   3.8.3. Units must place the 9-digit Equipment Identifier (EID) on all CTKs, tools not
   assigned to a box, and dispatchable equipment that is of sufficient size. The 9-digit EID must
   be placed on the outside of dispatchable CTKs. Tools located inside the tool box may be
   marked with less than 9-digits but must contain the 4-digit World Wide Identification
 32                                      AFI11-301V1_934AWSUP_I 18 NOVEMBER 2013


   (WWID) and identifying characters that tie the tool back to the CTK. For example, tools
   inside an assigned dispatchable CTK “U6JG00001” may be marked “U6JG1”.
   3.8.4. Inventory requirements. As a minimum, account for all CTKs, tools, and dispatchable
   equipment at the beginning and end of each shift, when moving from aircraft to aircraft,
   annually, and when custodians change. NOTE: Annual inventories do not replace inventories
   conducted each shift.
   3.8.5. Tool Accountability. AFE Flight commanders, superintendents and section NCOICs,
   through CTK custodians, are responsible for tool and equipment accountability and control
   (knowing where tools are and who has responsibility for them.) When a person signs for a
   tool or piece of equipment, they are accountable for the item until it is returned to the AFE
   section and accountability transfers back to the CTK custodian.

   a location where a training capability does not exist and the individual becomes due in an
   AFECT event, training must be accomplished before first flight at home station. AFRC and
   ANG FMs will determine time frame required to complete training upon arrival at home
   station.
   5.5.4. Emergency Egress and Parachute Descent Training (PDT) should be given
   concurrently when practical (ejection or non-ejection aircraft).
   5.5.5. Flight Surgeons will receive AFECT at frequencies determined IAW MDS-specific
   guidance.
   5.5.6. Aircrew members arriving PCS or visiting aircrews, such as those assigned to the
   inspector general, test squadrons, etc., are not required to re-accomplish egress or PDT if
   source documentation of currency can be obtained (e.g., ARMS) and they are current in the
   assigned aircraft. However, training on local unit specific AFE and rescue requirements will
   be accomplished.
   5.5.7. Aircrew members previously qualified in a given ejection seat equipped aircraft and
   currently in transition to a different model of the aircraft, or undergoing upgrade training in
   the same type of aircraft, may receive egress training at the regular interval from date last
   accomplished, if the escape systems and procedures are the same in both aircraft models.
   5.5.8. Aircrew members in transition from one type of ejection seat equipped aircraft to
   another and awaiting a Fighter Training Unit (FTU) slot will receive Emergency Egress and
   PDT at intervals determined by respective MAJCOM.
   5.5.9. Student aircrew members assigned to an FTU will receive emergency egress and PDT
   training IAW applicable syllabus.
   5.5.10. Initial and periodic ACDE training will be conducted IAW appropriate 11-2MDS-
   series, Vol 1 publications, this instruction, applicable TOs, and approved AFMLPs.
   5.5.11. An aircrew member may be credited with ACDT (LL04) during local operational
   readiness exercises provided all AFECT requirements and objectives are satisfied (i.e.
   crewmember donned chemical defense ensemble and subsequently processed through
   ACCA).
5.6. AFECT Safety. Safety is paramount when planning and conducting AFECT. As a
minimum, the following will apply:
5.6. (934AW)AFECT Safety.
 44                                       AFI11-301V1_934AWSUP_I 18 NOVEMBER 2013


   5.6.1. The group FEO or AFE superintendent, with assistance from the local safety office,
   will ensure ORM or other risk management programs or techniques are fully implemented,
   documented in unit lesson plans (LP), and tailored to their specific operation and location for
   all AFECT events.
   5.6.2. The AFE superintendent will develop and publish an Emergency Action Plan (EAP)
   for use during any training event where injury is likely, (e.g., AFE class if signal flares are
   activated). The EAP will be included in the unit LP, briefed by the lead instructor prior to
   each training event, and understood by every instructor and student prior to event start.
   5.6.2. (934AW) Respective AFE superintendent and training NCOIC will develop and
   publish an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for use during any training event where injury is
   likely, (e.g., AFE class if signal flares are activated). The EAP will be included in the unit
   Lesson Plan, briefed by the lead instructor prior to each training event.
5.7. Passenger and Incentive Flyer Training:
   5.7.1. Passengers scheduled for flight aboard ejection seat equipped aircraft will receive, as a
   minimum, emergency egress, PDT, and AFE training no earlier than 72 hours prior to flight.
   If the 72 hours are exceeded before flight, training will be re-accomplished. Emergency
   egress training includes cockpit familiarization, use of oxygen/communication controls and
   switches, and manual bailout procedures training, if applicable.
      5.7.1.1. Incentive/FAM riders flying over water beyond gliding distance to land will also
      receive water survival academics and hands on training with life preservers/life rafts.
   5.7.2. Non-rated personnel who fly occasionally to perform official duties (e.g., enroute
   ground support, security, etc.) will receive emergency egress, PDT, and AFE training at
   intervals determined by respective MAJCOM.
   5.7.3. Passengers scheduled for flight aboard non-ejection seat equipped aircraft will be
   briefed on emergency procedures and AFE as depicted in appropriate aircraft passenger
   briefing guides. The aircraft commander or their designated representative may conduct this
   briefing.
5.8. Training Documentation:
   5.8.1. All completed AFECT events will be documented on AF IMT 1522, ARMS Additional
   Training Accomplishment Report, or equivalent and maintained as a record of class
   attendance IAW AFI 37-139. Only those event identifiers shown in Table 5.1 of this
   instruction will be used to identify AFECT events.
   5.8.2. Upon completion of training, one or more rosters will be signed by the instructor and
   forwarded to appropriate office for input into ARMS. The OSS AFE Flight staff will keep a
   duplicate copy of the rosters on file.
   5.8.3. Instructors will provide written documentation to individuals who are from another
   unit (i.e., Inspector General, HHQs staff, and visiting aircrews) so their records can be
   updated at home station.
   5.8.4. FTU and Basic Fighter Training (BFT) student rosters will be maintained until
   graduation.
AFI11-301V1_934AWSUP_I 18 NOVEMBER 2013                                                      45


   5.8.5. AFE is not responsible for maintaining ARMS or managing and tracking aircrew
   training status for AFECT events in ARMS.
5.9. Training Aids and Equipment:
   5.9.1. Emergency ground and air egress and ejection seat training will be accomplished
   using the appropriate Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) when available or the actual aircraft
   only when an EPT is not available. Non-ejection seat egress training will be conducted using
   actual aircraft to the maximum extent possible.
   5.9.2. Units may use the actual aircraft installed ejection seat for egress training when
   designated training devices are not available provided all ejection seats are made safe by
   qualified egress personnel.
   5.9.3. For ACDT and egress training, aircrew members are required to wear all clothing and
   AFE items typically worn during contingency operations unless specifically prohibited by
   this instruction.
   5.9.4. AFECT instructors will inspect training devices and aids prior to use to ensure they
   are properly configured, safe, and operational for training. The AFE superintendent or their
   designated representative will perform annual inspections of all AFE training devices and
   aids to ensure they are current and safe for training use. This includes displays, ACDE, AFE,
   and personnel lowering devices. Inspections will be documented appropriately.
   5.9.5. Training equipment will mirror operational equipment to the maximum extent
   possible. Equipment used for training will be clearly marked “FOR TRAINING USE
   ONLY” and stored to prevent co-mingling with operational equipment. When training
   equipment does not exist (i.e., night vision devices, combat survival radios, etc.), MAJCOMs
   may designate the use of operational equipment for training as long as the training does not
   damage or destroy the integrity of the equipment.
5.10. Lesson Plans Development Guidance:
   5.10.1. AFECT Air Force Master Lesson Plans. AFMLPs are documents developed to
   prescribe instructional requirements, teaching points, and instructor-student activities
   essential to the accomplishment of training objectives for all AFECT. AFMLPs are designed
   to include the minimum training requirements and are essential for supervisors and
   instructors to ensure lesson objectives are completed.
   5.10.2. Only approved AFMLPs developed by the 361 TRS/TRR AFE CDC Writer,
   Sheppard AFB, TX will be used to conduct AFECT. The AFMLPs, developed by the 361
   TRS/TRR, are complete and ready be downloaded once they have been approved by Lead
   MDS MAJCOM. Units should delete information from the AFMLPs that does not pertain to
   their mission or unit. MAJCOMs will use AFMLPs developed by the 361 TRS/TRR.
   Furthermore, ARC units that have AFECTIs who are solely responsible for conducting code
   of conduct continuation training events will only use lesson plans approved by AFRC/A3TS
   or NGB/A3OS.
   5.10.3. The FEO or AFE superintendent must tailor down the AFMLP and produce an
   AFECT Master Lesson Plan (MLP) to meet their wings mission needs. AFECT MLP are un-
   personalized lesson plans used for control and standardization within an organization or unit
   that has been developed from the AFMLP by deleting unnecessary information based on a
46                                    AFI11-301V1_934AWSUP_I 18 NOVEMBER 2013


  units equipment or MDS. Group FEO/AFE superintendents who identify a need for a new
  AFMLP will forward request to MAJCOMs or Lead MDS MAJCOM for review of new
  requirement(s). Approved requests will be forwarded, and all data from Subject Matter
  Expert (SME) for development of AFMLP to 361 TRS/TRR AFE CDC Writer, Sheppard
  AFB, TX.
  5.10.4. AFECT LP. Lesson plans are documents developed from the AFECT MLP and
  prepared for use by each instructor to organize and present information. A personalized
  lesson plan contains information to aid the instructor. This is accomplished by writing
  personal instructional notes and material on the right-hand side of the AFECT MLP. The
  lesson plan must be validated with approved reference materials that can be produced upon
  request.
  5.10.5. All AFE MLPs and AFECT LPs used to conduct AFECT will be reviewed annually
  by the group FEO or AFE superintendent. Annual reviews will be documented as directed by
  individual MAJCOMs.
  5.10.6. Higher headquarters correspondence (e.g., messages, Flight Crew Information Files
  [FCIF], etc.) directing the inclusion of information not covered in AFECT AFMLPs or lesson
  plans will be added as directed by the 361 TRS/TRR.
  5.10.7. Designated Lead MAJCOM MDS SMEs will assist the 361 TRS/TRR in validating
  AFMLPs biennially during the World Wide AFE Workshop MAJCOM breakouts. If more
  frequent reviews are deemed necessary; the requesting MAJCOM will coordinate and fund
  for the CDC Writer to attend MAJCOM conference to accomplish the review with SMEs.
  The 361 TRS will notify the MAJCOMS of any changes to the AFMLPs and group
  FEO/AFE superintendent will update their MLPs upon notification by their MAJCOMs.

                                          Chapter 6

              AUTOMATED LIFE-SUSTAINING EQUIPMENT RECORDS

6.1. Overview. The ALERTS and APWEB are automated global data management systems
developed to allow “total asset visibility” of AFE items and associated documentation processes.
ALERTS is capable of supporting the entire AFE community to automate the data management
processes for most inspection, training, supply, and administration documents. The vision of
ALERTS is to provide the ability and means of improving the performance methods and
administration needs of the AFE community and support agencies using current COTS hardware,
software, and the military (.mil) network.
6.2. Automated Document and Management Systems:
   6.2.1. ALERTS. Once fully fielded, ALERTS will be used by all AFE functions within the
   Air Force IAW this chapter and MAJCOM supplements thereto. ALERTS Computer Based
   Training (CBT) is a mandatory training requirement prior to any individual using ALERTS
   in all organizations.
   6.2.2. ALSMS. ALSMS is a management tool used by AFE personnel. AFE units are
   authorized to continue using the ALSMS program to best suit their needs until they are
   designated by their MAJCOMS to be upgraded to ALERTS. Units tracking AFE items with
   the ALSMS program are not required to duplicate the data maintained in the computer on
   status boards, shop inspection cards, or forms. AFE superintendents will standardize
   equipment tracking methods within their respective groups.
   6.2.3. Aircrew       Protection    Website      (APWEB)         can     be   accessed     at:
   https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a37t/dot/DOTL/UnitData/UnitDataHomeFrame.cfm. All
   units that are not using ALERTS will use APWEB to document their end item data IAW the
   APWEB user manual. Each unit will provide all relevant data on each item to include;
   contract numbers, lot numbers, dates of manufacture, dates of expiration, back order
   quantities, off-base requisition numbers, and quantities deployed. The data contained within
   this site must be complete, verified, and validated by their respective MAJCOM prior to the
   unit being upgraded to ALERTS.
6.3. Responsibilities:
   6.3.1. Air Force ALERTS Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). HQ AMC is the primary
   OPR for the development, implementation, maintenance, and certification of ALERTS. The
   OPR will:
       6.3.1.1. Coordinate with the contract support team, AFE MAJCOM FMs, and the
       Aircrew Performance Executive Council (APEC).
       6.3.1.2. Oversee the support contracts and serve as the Contracting Officer Technical
       Representative (COTR) to resolve funding, project, and personnel issues.
       6.3.1.3. Sponsor and assist the support team representatives for ALERTS throughout the
       recertification process.

     data for AFE items except for COTS/NDI unless formally approved in accordance with
     the established COTS/NDI approval process.
     6.3.2.2. Coordinate on all aspects of provisioning for sustainment of AFE items (i.e.,
     illustrated parts breakdown [IPB] and or assembly definitions, etc.).
     6.3.2.3. Notify the ALERTS liaison and or the Air Force ALERTS OPR of the TCTO to
     be updated in the inspection definition prior to release of any TCTO.
     6.3.2.4. Extract, analyze, and make decisions based on data extract reports.
  6.3.3. AFCFM, MAJCOM and ANG FM, NAF. The AFCFM, MAJCOM and ANG FMs,
  and NAFs will:
     6.3.3.1. Extract, analyze, and make decisions based on data extract reports.
     6.3.3.2. Extract data for specialized high-level reports, (i.e., Annual Report to Congress
     for ACDE equipment, AFCAIG/CPFH program, etc).
     6.3.3.3. Establish an ALERTS POC within their command who will serve as the primary
     conduit to the Air Force ALERTS OPR and their units.

      6.3.5.5. Document corrective actions from quality control inspections.
      6.3.5.6. Ensure training records are correct.
6.4. ALERTS General Areas:
   6.4.1. Requesting Modifications or New Capabilities:
      6.4.1.1. Purpose.     ALERTS serves as the single focal point program in the
      documentation of all AFE processes. To meet the rapidly changing needs of the AFE
      community, the following process will be used to manage requests for modifications and
      new ALERTS capabilities outside of the scope of the current support contract. This
      process is described below.
      6.4.1.2. Changes to Policy/Procedure Documents and or ALERTS Processes.               The
      identifying user will accomplish the following:
          6.4.1.2.1. Provide a written proposal of the complete suggested process to their
          MAJCOM FM.
          6.4.1.2.2. The MAJCOM FM will validate the need and forward the proposed
          process to the Air Force ALERTS OPR.
          6.4.1.2.3. The Air Force ALERTS OPR will forward the proposal to the support
          contractor for evaluation.
          6.4.1.2.4. The support contractor will evaluate the proposed process and determine
          the technical feasibility.
          6.4.1.2.5. If the need is technically feasible, the Air Force ALERTS OPR will
          validate and forward to all using commands for their input. MAJCOM ALERTS
          POCs have 10 working days to evaluate proposals. Negative replies are required. If
          the need applies to only the proposing command, the Air Force ALERTS OPR will
          validate the need and proceed to the next step.
             6.4.1.2.5.1. If all MAJCOMs’ POCs do not agree, the proposal will be forwarded
             to HQ USAF/A3O-AT for final resolution.
             6.4.1.2.5.2. If all ALERTS MAJCOMs’ POCs agree, the support contractor will
             determine the cost for development and implementation.
          6.4.1.2.6. Once the technical feasibility and cost analysis are received, the proposal
          will be forwarded to the APWG and APEC for final determination and a funding
          solution.
             6.4.1.2.6.1. If approved and funding has been secured, the Air Force ALERTS
             OPR will initiate the development and implementation process.
AFI11-301V1_934AWSUP_I 18 NOVEMBER 2013                                                         51


             6.4.1.2.6.2. If disapproved, the submitting command will be notified by the Air
             Force ALERTS OPR and or the APEC of their decision and rationale for
             disapproval.
  6.4.2. Software Problem Report (SPR):
     6.4.2.1. Users will submit SPRs through the established procedures contained in
     APWEB or ALERTS websites. Users should contact their local Work Group Managers
     to validate there is not connectivity problems locally before contacting the help desk or
     submitting an SPR. There are 3 types of SPRs, which are described as follows: NOTE:
     The inability to connect or a slow response from the APWEB or ALERTS servers does
     not constitute a problem with these systems.
         6.4.2.1.1. Category 1. An identified requirement is nonfunctional.
         6.4.2.1.2. Category 2. An identified requirement is nonfunctional, but there is a valid
         work-around to accomplish a required task.
         6.4.2.1.3. Category 3. Administrative or cosmetic only and do not affect the function
         of the programs.
     6.4.2.2. Users will fill out all required information on the SPR submittal form to include
     detailed descriptions of the problem when required.
  6.4.3. AFE Automated Information Technology (AIT) Barcode Marking Standard. All AFE
  units with acquisition authority will refer to their responsibilities paragraphs contained within
  this instruction and Attachment 2 for implementing the AF AFE AIT barcode marking
  standard for AFE supplies.
  6.4.4. Standards.
     6.4.4.1. Nomenclature Standard. To ensure a common standard for nomenclatures
     within ALERTS, units will use the technical order IPBs or manufacturer’s manuals when
     establishing items. Items or equipment not addressed in IPBs, formal technical orders, or
     manuals will be assigned a nomenclature by 77 AESG or 642 CBSG.
     6.4.4.2. Air Force Kit/Aircraft Configuration Naming Standards. To ensure global data
     reporting capability, units will use the identified standards contained within ALERTS.
     Request additional templates IAW paragraph 6.4.1 of this Instruction.
     6.4.4.3. Item Supply Detail Data. All relevant data on these screens will be tracked by
     all AFE units. If the data is not available units will use the standard established below for
     all unknown data fields.
  6.4.5. Data Entry Standards:
     6.4.5.1. Within APWEB, units attempting to enter data that is unavailable will use
     “UNK” for unknown text fields, and 01/01/1900 for unknown date fields. All unknown
     data fields that are not mandatory will be left blank.
     6.4.5.2. Within ALERTS, all unknown data fields not mandatory will be left blank. For
     mandatory fields, units will use the APWEB standard.
 52                                      AFI11-301V1_934AWSUP_I 18 NOVEMBER 2013


      6.4.5.3. All contract number and lot number entries must include the full contract and lot
      number and be entered into ALERTS exactly as they appear on the item. This will
      ensure there is no confusion when data is recalled.
   6.4.6. LOGIN Standard for AFE Personnel and Aircrew. LOGIN standard is case sensitive
   and includes the last name, first initial, and last six numbers of individual’s SSN. AFE units
   must scan the one-dimensional bar code on the backside of the aircrew’s military
   identification card for the ALERTS login.
   6.4.7. APWEB and ALERTS Data Protection; For Official Use Only (FOUO):
      6.4.7.1. Reports generated from APWEB/ALERTS will be considered FOUO, unless
      otherwise marked, and must be protected IAW DoD and AF instructions.
      6.4.7.2. Reports containing personnel data, i.e., SSN will have the privacy act statement
      affixed.
      6.4.7.3. Aircraft tail number location in ALERTS must use the last six digits as the
      standard (EXAMPLE: 99-0011). This will allow full integration of the new automated
      forecasting system and the requirements established by 84 MUSG/GJ (OO-ALC) for
      properly tracking and forecasting time change items for replacement.
   6.4.8. Configuration Data File (CDF) Process:
      6.4.8.1. The CDF established for accountable equipment items will be maintained in
      AFEMS IAW AFMAN 23-110. Accountable and non-accountable equipment end item
      authorizations will be documented and maintained in APWEB/ALERTS. Air Staff,
      MAJCOMs, and 77 AESG when experiencing acquisition difficulties, may direct units to
      document authorizations and on-hand quantities within these programs.
6.5. ALERTS Operations Areas:
   6.5.1. Aircraft Accident Data Records. Upon notification from a competent authority, the
   AFE superintendent, squadron system administrator, or AFE NCOIC will freeze all AFE
   records for equipment involved in a mishap. To ensure data fidelity for the safety review
   board, these records will remain frozen until such time as determined by the involved
   MAJCOM Staff Judge Advocate or delegated authority. Once authority has been granted,
   the AFE superintendent will notify the contractor help desk to unfreeze the records.
   6.5.2. Data Review Requirement. AFE superintendents and NCOICs or designated
   individual will review APWEB and ALERTS to validate data accuracy every 180 days.
   6.5.3. CTK Procedures. AFE specialized equipment used on the flightline will be marked
   and managed IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, and
   Chapter 3 of this instruction.
   6.5.4. Equipment Accountability. ALERTS specialized equipment will be marked and
   managed IAW AFI 33-112, Computer Systems Management.
   6.5.5. ALERTS Data Record Transfer Process:
      6.5.5.1. Units using ALERTS to transfer equipment, personnel, or aircraft records to
      other ALERTS enabled units will use the ALERTS electronic data transfer process.
AFI11-301V1_934AWSUP_I 18 NOVEMBER 2013                                                     53


      6.5.5.2. Units using ALERTS to transfer equipment, personnel, or aircraft records to
      non-ALERTS enabled units will still use the ALERTS electronic data transfer process.
      However, the information will be stored under a general identified Personnel Accounting
      System (PAS) code until the receiving unit comes online with ALERTS. The sending
      unit will also provide paper copies of all required forms.
   6.5.6. AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, Process. AFE units with ALERTS fully
   implemented can use ALERTS in lieu of the AF IMT 1297 to transfer responsibility of the
   item. MAJCOMs may implement more restrictive accountability procedures as required.
   6.5.7. Contact Memory Button (CMB) Processes and Mounting. MAJCOMs will develop
   their own implementation process for units using the CMB.
   6.5.8. Interaction with Mobility Inventory Control & Accountability System (MICAS). Air
   Staff or MAJCOM will provide the APWEB or ALERTS data associated with MICAS to
   data managers when requested through these programs.
   6.5.9. Deployment and Multi-Command or Multi-Unit Operations:
      6.5.9.1. Units will use the guidance in the ALERTS user and process manuals for these
      operations. Units who do not have any ALERTS specialized equipment or are not
      connected to the ALERTS site while deployed will refer to paragraph 6.5.10 for
      documentation procedures.
      6.5.9.2. Non-ALERTS units, or units not using CMB, which service multi-place aircraft
      will preposition a copy of all AFE items inspection records on the aircraft prior to all
      deployments.
   6.5.10. Units will develop documentation procedures to update ALERTS data when
   connectivity is not available or if they do not have the necessary hardware to use ALERTS in
   the unconnected mode. This will include all maintenance actions, QA, and any other actions.
   6.5.11. DoD, Air Force and AFTO Forms/IMT, and Other Documentation (NL555, Battery
   Inspection Label) Within the Sections/Shops. Units implementing ALERTS do not have to
   use serviceability tags to identify equipment in service, storage, or otherwise used unless
   specifically required in AFMAN 23-110 or required by Air Force technical orders. Units
   will use condition code tags when turning in equipment to supply IAW AFMAN 23-110.
   MAJCOMs may implement more restrictive accountability procedures to distinguish
   serviceability of equipment as required.
   6.5.12. ALERTS will use a single type of inspection record for all AFE items when
   applicable.
   6.5.13. AF Form 623 (Automated). ALERTS is the primary electronic equivalent authorized
   means to provide the capability to electronically track all AFE technician training.
   MAJCOMS will develop an implementation process for using the electronic ALERTS AF
   Form 623. NOTE: TBA is an authorized AF Form 623 automated electronic equivalent
   alternative for those units that do not have access to ALERTS.

6.6. Adopted Forms

                                          Attachment 2
AIR FORCE STANDARD AFE AUTOMATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (AIT)
                       BARCODE MARKING

Contractors and suppliers for all AFE systems to include subcomponents shall use bar code
nameplates, labels, or direct part markings IAW DoD MIL-STD-130 Change 1, DoD UID
Guide, and this document. Use of an advanced part marking technology like bar codes and 2D
symbols is essential to the AFE community being able to facilitate automated “removal and
replace” features of automated programming and product support/maintenance. Exceptions to
use of machine-readable nameplates will be considered, on a case-by-case basis, in accordance
with practical or good business sense (e.g., part too small for nameplate, part immersed in fuel
tank, etc.). AFE will consider other advanced part marking technology should they become
commercially practicable, driven by DoD requirements, and or advantageous to the government
in the future.

Marking Requirements.

Human Readable Information (HRI) and Machine Readable Information (MRI) are required for
current AIT systems to provide the necessary advances in efficiency. Defense Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and the DoD has mandated the use of Data Matrix
ECC 200 as the standard format for UID MRI markings. Overarching guidance for the construct
and application of Data Matrix markings is contained in MIL-STD-130 and DoD UID Guide
located at www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/UID. Specific examples are given here for manufactures and
suppliers for implementation.

AFE has three different situations that require or can require different markings and they are:

a. UID Serialized Lot Batch; Items controlled with serial numbers and lot numbers
b. UID Serialized Data Stream; Items controlled with serial numbers only
c. Non UID/Non Serialized Lot Batch; Items that do not meet the UID requirement and are not
controlled with serial numbers.

See figures 1 – 6 for specific examples of the labels and data streams.

HRI Marking Requirements. The following HRI data is required (as a minimum):

- Manufacturer’s Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, 5 alpha/numeric characters

- Item Lot Number

           NOTE: The Lot Number MUST be unique within the manufacturer’s
           CAGE (Lot Numbers cannot be repeated on other part numbers)

- Item Serial Number
 72                                       AFI11-301V1_934AWSUP_I 18 NOVEMBER 2013


           NOTE: Air Force contracts typically require 5 digit serial numbers
           (minimum), sequentially assigned, not to be repeated until serial number
           99,999 has been reached

- Item manufacturer’s Part Number

           NOTE: The weapon system Specification Number does not meet this
           requirement

- Contract Number (CNCT#), 13 alpha/numeric characters

- Date of Manufacture; Year and Day of manufacture in Julian Date format

           NOTE: Markings and/or attachments shall make no reference to item
           installation requirements/procedures or shelf/service lives.

MRI Data Construct.

Data Matrix ECC200 markings shall be developed based on UID Data Construct #2 using Data
Identifiers (DIs) in accordance with MIL-STD-130 and the DoD UID Guide (see Figure 2). To
facilitate durability throughout the scanning life cycle, the largest symbol size, including quiet
zone, shall be fitted within the available marking real estate. The symbol’s internal module (cell)
sizes shall be no smaller than 0.0075 inch (0.19 mm) and no larger than 0.025 inch (0.64 mm).
Marks shall contain only the data elements identified below:

           NOTE: The parentheses surrounding the Data Identifier are NOT encoded in the 2D
           symbol.

- (17V) Manufacturer’s Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, 5 alpha/numeric
characters.

- (1T) Item production Lot Number, IAW HRI requirement, Maximum 20 alpha/numeric,
including special characters (- or/).

           NOTE: The lot number MUST be unique within the manufacturer’s CAGE
           (Lot Numbers cannot be repeated on other part numbers)

- (S) Item Serial Number, IAW HRI requirement, Maximum 20 alpha/numeric including special
characters (- or/).

- (1P) Manufacturer’s Item Part Number, Maximum 20 alpha/numeric including special
characters (- or/).

           NOTE: The weapon system Specification Number does not meet this
           requirement.

    - (8K) Contract Number (Cont No), Maximum 13 alpha/numeric characters.

              NOTE: For this data element the dashes are not transmitted in the data stream.

    - (4D) Date of Manufacture (DOM) in Julian Date format, five numeric characters:

                                EXAMPLE: 06151 = 31 May 2006

              The first two positions are the last two digits of the year; the last three
              positions are the Julian Date (001 through 366)
