                                           Chapter 1

            AIR AND SPACE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE (AEF) CONCEPTS

1.1. General. The AEF is the Air Force‟s methodology for organizing, training, equipping, and
sustaining rapidly responsive air and space forces to meet defense strategy requirements.
Through the AEF, the Air Force supports defense strategy requirements using a combination of
both permanently assigned and rotational (allocated) forces.
   1.1.1. How to use this AFI. This AFI governs Unit Type Code (UTC) status reporting. This
   instruction should be followed in the context of AFI 10-401 Air Force Operations Planning
   and Execution, which contains planning considerations for these UTCs and a full description
   of AEF concepts. Chapter 1 contains the basic description of the AEF and AEF UTC
   Reporting Tool (ART). Chapter 2 outlines roles and responsibilities in UTC reporting.
   Chapter 3 describes assessment and reporting policies.
1.2. Force Presentation. The Air Force aligns its war fighting capabilities into a baseline of 10
AEFs, each intended to contain an equivalent capability from which to provide forces. During
periods of increased requirements, capability areas from these 10 AEFs may be realigned within
the Global AEF construct to a Tempo Band that provides a deeper pool of capability, deploying
that capability at a more stringent deploy-to-dwell rate. The Air Force develops and tailors force
packages to meet mission requirements. Specifically tailored forces are presented to theater
commanders as Air and Space Expeditionary Task Forces (AETFs). Refer to Air Force Doctrine
Document (AFDD) 2 for doctrinal guidance on force presentation. The AEF will include
strategic “enabler” or common user assets, such as long-range mobility, Special Operations
Forces (SOF), and space forces, that will provide support to authorized organizations within and
outside of the Department of Defense (DOD), including Air Force movements of AEF forces.
Also postured as enablers, the Air Force‟s High Demand/Low Supply (HD/LS) assets (U2, E-8
JSTARS, E-3 AWACS, RC-135 RIVET JOINT, SOF, CSAR, etc.), will play critical roles in
AEF operations.
1.3. Spectrum of Operations. The National Military Strategy dictates that the Air Force be
prepared to support requirements across the spectrum of operations from humanitarian and
disaster relief operations up to and including major war (MW). The Air Force will meet its day-
to-day steady-state deployed operational commitments using the UTCs assigned to the two on-
call AEFs, one on-call AEW, and available enabler forces. Any substantial or sustained
commitment of forces beyond this level will constitute a surge for the Air Force, which will
require some degree of reconstitution of the involved forces after the surge ends.
1.4. Force Management. The AEF libraries contain a finite amount of capability that at any
given time identifies forces that constitute the total force that has been made available or
allocated for scheduling. The 10 AEFs are paired (e.g. AEF 1 and 2, AEF 3 and 4, etc.) into five
4-month contingency on-call/deployment eligibility period every 20 months. Most LS/HD assets,
as defined in GMFP, are not formally assigned to individual AEFs but are postured in the
Enabler library and will rotate as operational requirements dictate. Deployment levels must be
consistent with GMFP guidelines. Air refueling forces and medium-range airlift forces (currently
consisting of C-130 units) will be assigned to AEFs and enabler operations, subject to careful
scheduling to avoid over tasking.

1.5. Reporting AEF Status - General. To view the health of forces in the ten (10) designated
AEF's, AEWs, lead mobility wings and enablers, Air Force senior leadership determined a need
to collect UTC readiness status data from all AEF-allocated UTCs of sufficient detail to support
the following goals:
     1.5.1. Provide HQ USAF, AF Component Commanders, MAJCOM's, and AFPC/DPW
     readiness information to employ, manage, and sustain AEF operations.
     1.5.2. Provide units a mechanism to report a UTC‟s current and future (6 months out) ability
     or inability to fulfill its Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) across the full ROMO, to
     include contingency and rotational operations, and highlight associated deficiencies within
     the UTC.
     1.5.3. Provide information to aid resource allocation and tasking decisions during steady
     state and crisis actions.
1.6. System Description: The AEF UTC Status Reporting Tool (ART) is designed to support
the goals listed above. ART allows AEF-allocated units the ability to report UTC level readiness
data. It provides one central location to archive reported data. It allows immediate updates and
ready access to an aggregate UTC status for all levels of command with sufficient depth of
information to make informed decisions on the employment of forces for AEF operations. It
further provides a means for identifying and analyzing actionable indicators of change.
     1.6.1. ART is a web-based, non-intrusive, html-environment tool with associated databases
     to support collection, collation, and report generation of unit and aggregate UTC readiness
     data. It resides on the SIPRNET (https://aefcenter.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil/) for secure
     access. Units that are levied UTC taskings under AEF, view and report their status against
     these taskings directly within the ART application.
     1.6.2. ART's report generating capability allows all levels of command to arrange data to
     produce tailored written reports and graphics. The reports section is read-only and can be
     accessed by anyone with SIPRNET access.
     1.6.3. A       fully   functional    training      site    exists      on    the     NIPRNET
     (https://aefcenter.afpc.randolph.af.mil/). This site also allows personnel to review the ART
     tutorial and other guidance. There are no restrictions on this site; anyone can login and enter
     training data or experiment with the report section. DO NOT enter real world data on the
     training site.
     1.6.4. Operationally, ART supports the goals stated above by collecting and collating unit-
     reported data to answer, in whole or in part, the following associated questions:
        1.6.4.1. Are AEF allocated UTCs able to accomplish their MISCAP defined mission if
        tasked
        1.6.4.2. Are AEF allocated UTCs able to accomplish their component tasked mission?
        1.6.4.3. Do adequate resources exist and is training available in order to accomplish and
        sustain the AEF mission(s)?
     1.6.5. ART complements readiness data reported in Status of Resources and Training
     Systems (SORTS). ART focuses reporting on the modular scalable capability-based UTC‟s
     designed to meet the needs of the 21st century force while SORTS is unit-centric with
AFI10-244_AMCSUP_FAIRCHILDAFBSUP_I 1 MAY 2012                                                  7


  reporting based on major war (MW) commitments. The basis for both systems is the AEF
  Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) library (Once the UTC Availability Module
  (UTA) is available in DCAPES, it will be the basis.). The tasking baseline contained in ART
  is derived from the AEF Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) library which
  supports the range of military operations (ROMO). Readiness assessments for MW and AEF
  tasking must be considered together; however, the reporting guidelines for each may be
  independent. A unit‟s C level as reported in SORTS may not directly correlate to its ability to
  support a specific UTC tasking as indicated in ART.

                           ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. ART Reporting. Unit commander assessments reported in ART present the status of each
UTC in the AEF library; and they provide higher levels of command the necessary information
to make force and resource allocation decisions to effectively support theater commanders.
Within the AEF construct, the UTC assessments are used to determine the most effective force
tasking. Effective management of Air Force resources requires accurate information at all levels.
For these reasons integrity in reporting an accurate status is paramount. ART is not a report card,
but a method of identifying a UTCs ability to perform its MISCAP and identify shortages of
resources therefore, commanders must "tell it like it is."
2.2. Headquarters USAF.

            SCHEDULES. Training will also be provided at the request of any unit ART
            point of contact (POC).
            2.7.3.6.4.2. (Added-FAIRCHILD AFB) Initial unit commander training will be
            accomplished as soon as possible after a new commander arrives on station and
            refresher will be on a yearly basis, when required, or when requested. This
            training will be on a one-on-one basis or via e-mail.

        secure internet protocol router network (SIPRNET) e-mail.
     2.7.3.9. (Added-AMC) Wing ART POCs will maintain a listing of all wing and unit
     ART Monitors. Unit ART accounts will not be approved by the wing ART POCs unless
     a unit ART appointment letter has been submitted.
        2.7.3.9.1. (Added-AMC) Wing ART POC will maintain a consolidated listing of
        unit ART monitors and approved unit ART accounts. Wing ART POCs will maintain
        copies of current appointment letters, with unit commander signature, for all unit
        ART monitors.
        2.7.3.9.2. (Added-AMC) At a minimum, wing ART POC listings are required to be
        reviewed quarterly for accuracy. Unit ART Monitors that no longer require write
        access will be deleted from the ART system. Document quarterly review and
        maintain it in a ART continuity binder.

            initial changes in ART procedures and keeping the wing Monitors informed of
            ongoing ART events. It is the first line of communications from AMC/A3OCR to
            the wing ART Monitors. It ensures that important ART information is
            disseminated in a rapid and formalized manner. AIF messages will be transmitted
            by electronic mail and the message format will be IAW AFH 33-337, Tongue and
            Quill. AIF releasing authority will be AMC/A3OCR and to ensure the AIF
            system‟s integrity AMC/A3OCR will maintain control of sequence numbers and a
            master list of AIF items released. Each wing ART Monitors will maintain the
            AIF as part of their ART continuity binder.
        2.7.3.11.4. (Added-AMC) Training program for wing and unit ART monitors
        complete with training materials, sample worksheets, and documentation of
        completed training.
        2.7.3.11.5. (Added-AMC) Classify ART continuity binders IAW Chapter 3 of AFI

     the direction of AMC/A3OCR. To handle ART problems at the lowest possible level and
     prevent circumvention of command authority levels, wing ART monitors will solicit all
     contact with AEF Center through AMC/A3OCR.
     2.7.3.13. (Added-AMC) On a weekly basis, ensure units update the ART database IAW
     AFI 10-244, Reporting Status of Aerospace Expeditionary Forces, and this supplement.
     2.7.3.14. (Added-AMC) Establish a ART SAV program for all units as follows:
        2.7.3.14.1. (Added-AMC) Develop and distribute a SAV schedule annually. Visit
        each unit at least annually to conduct ART SAVs. SAVs may be performed more
        often if deemed necessary by the wing ART monitor. Maintain the most current
        completed SAV results.
18                            AFI10-244_AMCSUP_FAIRCHILDAFBSUP_I 1 MAY 2012


         2.7.3.14.2. (Added-AMC) Staff the SAV results (observations, findings, and
         recommendations) by memorandum to the unit commander and the Unit ART
         monitor. Ensure the wing commander is also addressed on the report.
         2.7.3.14.3. (Added-AMC) Ensure unit monitors staff replies to SAV results through
         the unit commander to the wing commander and wing ART office. Ensure
         observations and findings are suspensed and tracked until closed.
  2.7.4. Units.
     2.7.4.1. Appoint and train ART personnel IAW wing/group or equivalent direction.
         2.7.4.1.1. (Added-FAIRCHILD AFB) Initial unit training should be conducted and
         documented by either the Primary or Alternate Unit Monitor within seven days of
         appointment by their squadron/group commander. If not accomplished within seven
         days, ensure the reason is documented. At a minimum, training will cover any unit
         unique requirements, submission requirements, data gathering process, security
         classifications, and hands on portion in the ART database. Initial unit training
         documentation will be provided to the Wing ART manager after the training is
         completed.
         2.7.4.1.2. (Added-FAIRCHILD AFB) Initial and annual training conducted by the
         Wing ART manager is mandatory for all Unit ART Monitors and should be
         conducted in a classroom, but can be accomplished via e-mail as a last resort. E-mail
         will only be used as a last case scenario. Training will be scheduled and published on
         a yearly basis (calendar year). Training will also be provided at the request of any
         unit ART POC.
         2.7.4.1.3. (Added-FAIRCHILD AFB) Each ART reporting unit must have a copy
         of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-244, Reporting Status of Aerospace Expeditionary
         Forces, AFI 10-244_AMCSUP_I, AFI 10-244_AMCSUP_I_FAIRCHILDAFBSUP,
         and AFI 10-400, AEF Planning and Operations. These documents can be either hard
         copy or electronically filed on a shared location for their unit.
     2.7.4.2. Designate ART OPR in writing as directed by the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU.
     Include name(s), rank(s), unit and DSN telephone number. Continuity and consistency in
     this position is critical and therefore should be for a minimum of 18 months.
         2.7.4.2.1. (Added-AMC) Unit Commanders will designate in writing a primary and
         alternate unit ART POC. Submit a copy of the commander signed letter to the wing
         ART monitors. Letter must include names, ranks, organization, DSN, and classified
         and unclassified e-mail addresses.
             2.7.4.2.1.1. (Added-AMC) Designated unit ART monitors will establish and
             maintain an ART account.
             2.7.4.2.1.2. (Added-FAIRCHILD AFB) Unit Monitors will not be added to the
             Unit Monitor POC letter or the e-mail address list until all training has been
             completed. POC letters will be re-accomplished annually or when changes
             occur in Unit Monitors and/or commanders.
                  2.7.4.2.1.2.1. (Added-FAIRCHILD AFB) Unit Monitors will not be
                  granted an ART account without first attending both initial training sessions
AFI10-244_AMCSUP_FAIRCHILDAFBSUP_I 1 MAY 2012                                              19


                (Unit Training and Wing Training) and be on the unit‟s current appointment
                letter. Monitors will not be added to the ART e-mail address listing until all
                training is completed.
                2.7.4.2.1.2.2. (Added-FAIRCHILD AFB) POC letters will include all Unit
                Type Code (UTC) that the unit is responsible for.
     2.7.4.3. Report on all UTCs allocated to an AEF, Enabler, or Bundle.
     2.7.4.4. Ensure data and remarks adequately and accurately reflect the UTC's capability.
     2.7.4.5. Ensures report submissions meet established time lines.
        2.7.4.5.1. (Added-FAIRCHILD AFB) The monthly ART update is due between
        the 20th - 25th of each month. However, that does not excluded the Unit Monitor‟s
        responsibility for updating when changes occur. When a change occurs, ART for that
        UTC must be updated within 24 hours of being informed of the change. Unit
        Monitors should schedule their ART appointments with their squadron
        commander/group commander early enough to ensure the above timelines are met.
     2.7.4.6. Review discrepancies noted in previous reports and actions being taken to
     correct them. Release the report for entry into the ART system.
     2.7.4.7. If discrepancies are noted between other deployment tasking databases and the
     UTA information loaded in ART, it is incumbent on the unit to research the disconnect
     and work to resolve the issue with MAJCOM FAMs.
        2.7.4.7.1. (Added-FAIRCHILD AFB) Units will check their ART database at least
        every Tuesday and Thursday (the two days that Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC),
        Directorate of AEF Operations (AFPC/DPW) does refresh) to see any changes that
        may have occurred for their unit. This can be done using the report function on the
        ART site or reviewing your changes on the initial ART web page. All UTCs that
        require update will be updated as soon as possible.
     2.7.4.8. DELETED
     2.7.4.9. (Added-AMC) Unit commanders shall establish procedures to ensure all
     concerned offices coordinate on, or provided the required worksheets/data, to the unit
     ART POC prior to submission of the ART report to the unit commander for approval.
        2.7.4.9.1. (Added-FAIRCHILD AFB) Written procedures will identify how their
        units procedures flow. Procedures should be specific enough that it is clear how the
        information is collected and processed.
     2.7.4.10. (Added-AMC) Unit commanders must be continually cognizant of current and
     projected resource status in order to provide accurate GWD projections when submitting
     ART assessments.
     2.7.4.11. (Added-AMC) Unit commanders must establish procedures to accurately
     gather, prepare, validate, and submit ART assessments, reports, and certification message
     to the Wing/Group ART POC IAW established time lines.
     2.7.4.12. (Added-AMC) Establish and maintain unit ART continuity binder(s)
     containing the following documents:

     2.7.4.12.1. (Added-AMC) Appointment letter for unit ART monitors.
     2.7.4.12.2. (Added-AMC) A copy of current unit ART assessment(s) submitted to
     the Wing POC to include worksheets and all other supporting documentation used to
     compile the ART report. A copy of the unit‟s final ART report and supporting
     documents will be maintained for 30 days.
        2.7.4.12.2.1. (Added-FAIRCHILD AFB) A copy of the unit‟s final ART report
        and supporting documents will be provided to the the Wing ART Manager no
        later than five days after the final report is submitted.
        2.7.4.12.2.2. (Added-FAIRCHILD AFB) Updates made to the ART database
        other than the monthly assessment do not need to be provided to the Wing POC;
        however, they do need to be kept for 30 days. These daily/weekly assessments do
        not need to be approved by the unit commander, if the unit commander has
        designated approval authority for daily/weekly assessments to the unit ART
        monitor on the unit‟s POC letter.
     2.7.4.12.3. (Added-AMC) HQ and wing guidance, letters, messages, etc.

     messages will be transmitted by e-mail from the 92 ARW ART Manager and the
     message format will be IAW Air Force Handbook (AFH) 33-337, Tongue and Quill.
     AIF releasing authority will be Air Mobility Command (AMC/A3OCR) and to ensure
     the AIF system‟s integrity, AMC/A3OCR will maintain control of sequence numbers
     and a master list of AIF items released. Each Unit ART Monitor will maintain the
     AIF as part of their ART continuity binders. Maintain the AIF IAW AFMAN 33-363
     and, in the AFRIMS RDS. Ensure your file plan references the location of the
     documents.
     2.7.4.12.7. (Added-FAIRCHILD AFB) Unit ART monitors will maintain a unit
     ART self-inspection program and conduct self-inspections at least twice a year as
     directed by the 92 ARW Commander. A copy of the findings will be provided to the
     92 ARW ART Manager. Open items will be left open and tracked by the Unit
     Monitors. The 92 ARW ART Manager will be notified when all items are complete
     via e-mail or letter.

      2.7.4.13. (Added-AMC) Unit ART offices will be responsive to the wing ART offices,
      who will act as liaison between Unit ART offices and the AMC/A3OCR. To handle ART
      problems at the lowest possible level and to prevent circumvention of command authority
      levels, unit ART monitors will solicit all contact with AEF Center and AMC/A3OCR
      through their wing ART monitors.
   2.7.5. Units Required to Report. All Air Force units including Air National Guard and
   Reserve components owning UTCs allocated in an AEF or designated an enabler will report
   the status of their UTCs IAW this instruction.
2.8. Total Force Integration (TFI) Readiness Reporting Policy
   2.8.1. TFI units are critical to Air Force operations. They are organizational constructs that
   functionally integrate units from the regular Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force
   Reserve. Each unit in the association (host and associate) will independently report their
   readiness in ART.

                                  REPORTING POLICIES

3.1. Classification. ART contains real world deployment and personnel data. It is incumbent on
all personnel to be aware of the classification of data entered in ART. A UTC assessments in
ART is classified confidential, aggregate unit UTC reports are classified secret IAW Executive
Order (EO) 12958. Do not enter data that is classified under other guidance such as "Special
Access Required" information.
3.2. ART Data Classification. Executive Order (EO) 12958, Classified National Security
Information, requires us to protect classified information while striking a balance between
protection and the need to inform the American public of their governmental activities.
Additionally, this EO increases and emphasizes personal responsibility for classification and
declassification decisions.
   3.2.1. Derivative Classification. Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing,
   restating, or generating in a new form information that is already classified, and marking the
   newly developed material consistent with the classification markings that apply on the source
   information.
       3.2.1.1. Derivative Classifier. Persons applying derivative classification markings must
       carry forward to any newly created document the classification markings from the
       original source or document.
       3.2.1.2. ART assessment data (i.e., color codes, missing resources detailed in remarks,
       and limiting factors) for a single UTC, is classified at a minimum CONFIDENTIAL.
       3.2.1.3. Aggregate ART assessments (two or more UTC assessments) are classified
       SECRET. ART data converted to a new type information must be evaluated for its impact
       on national security if released.
       3.2.1.4. Data classification. Raw resource data used to derive UTC assessments is
       classified IAW it‟s original source. When data is directly associated with an ART rating
       or used in an ART worksheet, the data becomes classified IAW this guidance.
       Preformatted worksheets should be clearly marked with instructions on classification.
       3.2.1.5. Classification Authority. As with SORTS, ART combines elements of the
       JOPES database with assessments of the ability of units to provide combat capability.
       The assessments are used in the Air Force war-planning effort as a readiness feed to the
       Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) which
       parallels SORTS and JOPES war-planning capability. The Joint Staff SORTS database is
       classified SECRET. Information extracted from this database is classified IAW, CJCSI
       3401.02 and must contain derivative classification markings consistent with EO 12958,
       except where authorized otherwise. Derivative classification rules apply when extracts
       contain exempted data. ART will follow this same rule set and classification guidance.
       3.2.1.6. Classification Marking. ART data or extracts are classified by this AFI. Mark
       documents or data “DERIVED FROM: AFI 10-244 dated 12 Sep 05, Declassify on:
       (date).” The date of declassification is 4 years from the date of the document for each
       level of classification. Declassification timeline is 4 years for CONFIDENTIAL, 8 years
AFI10-244_AMCSUP_FAIRCHILDAFBSUP_I 1 MAY 2012                                               23


       for SECRET. See DOD 5200.1r, Information Security Program and CJCSM 3150.02
       Global Status of Resources and Training for additional classification guidance.
       3.2.1.7. Downgrading Authority. Initial downgrading of force readiness data and
       aggregate information will be determined by CJCS. HQ USAF/A3/5 is the authority to
       extend or accelerate downgrading classification of ART and SORTS data following an
       initial determination by CJCS.
3.3. What to Report. Commanders will report the unit‟s current ability through the next six
months to support each allocated UTC. NOTE: ART uses an extract of the approved UTC/UIC
AEF assignment of forces in the UTC Availability. A-UTCs are not currently reported in ART.
ART is a source for AEF UTC/UIC alignment for the unit commander.
   3.3.1. Units reporting SORTS with UTCs allocated to an AEF or identified as an enabler
   shall continue to report SORTS IAW their Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statement
   and AFI 10-201, in addition to reporting in ART.
3.4. UTC Assessments. Assessments are based on all aspects of the UTC to include: (1) the
ability to perform the capability defined by the Mission Capability (MISCAP) Statement, (2) can
fulfill the standard manpower requirements, and (3) can fulfill the complete equipment
requirements.     The Logistic Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR) Logistics Detail
(LOGDET) and Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) of the Manpower and
Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK) will be used to maintain the manpower and
equipment requirements.
   3.4.1. Response Time. A UTC readiness assessment is based on resources that are expected
   to be mission ready and available within their DOC response time, (if the UTC is referenced
   in the unit‟s DOC statement), or within 72 hours of tasking or less depending on the UTC
   requirements. A UTC is eligible to be tasked to perform its mission at any time.
   3.4.2. The Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) provides a brief description of the
   capability for which the UTC is designed.
   3.4.3. The Logistic Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR) provides a list of equipment the
   UTC requires to perform the mission.
   3.4.4. The Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) contains the manpower detail
   required to provide the capability for a standard UTC.
   3.4.5. Commanders provide an assessment of UTC readiness based on the unit's ability to
   provide the UTC for mission execution at any time.
   3.4.6. Commanders are not constrained by the unit SORTS "C" rating when assessing the
   health of the UTC.
   3.4.7. Commanders rate each UTC against the unit's current ability to deploy and employ
   the UTC. Areas to be considered are personnel, equipment, training, and equipment
   condition. Personnel must be worldwide mobility qualified and have all required mission and
   skill level training complete IAW applicable directives and instructions. Equipment must be
   serviceable and available for deployment.
       3.4.7.1. Equipment and supplies on hand reporting includes the status of LOGFOR
       equipment and supplies required to support the UTC. It may indicate budget and supply
24                           AFI10-244_AMCSUP_FAIRCHILDAFBSUP_I 1 MAY 2012


     problems when details are known. Commanders determine the readiness status based on
     the availability of mission required equipment and supplies. Items are considered
     available if they are assigned to the unit and are physically present at the unit for
     deployment.
         3.4.7.1.1. Units should report the status of UTCs as stand-alone requirements. For
         “rainbowed” UTCs where a UTC has both personnel and equipment requirements,
         but shares the equipment with a sister organization already deployed, the UTC should
         be assessed as Red, since it does not currently have the required equipment prior to
         deployment. For a rainbowed UTC a comment should be entered to indicate the status
         of the shared equipment.
         3.4.7.1.2. (Added-AMC) Equipment and supplies are required to be available to
         redeploy within 72 hours, unless otherwise directed by the MAJCOM.
     3.4.7.2. The equipment condition area is used to determine the combat essential and
     support equipment that can be made ready within the UTC's response time to undertake
     the mission. Units assess the equipment condition for combat essential and support
     equipment based on the availability of required equipment.
         3.4.7.2.1. Units should report the status of UTCs as stand-alone requirements. For
         “rainbowed” UTCs where a UTC has both personnel and equipment requirements,
         but shares the equipment with a sister organization already deployed, the UTC should
         be assessed as Red, since it does not currently have the required equipment prior to
         deployment. For a rainbowed UTC a comment should be entered to indicate the status
         of the shared equipment.
     3.4.7.3. The training assessment area indicates the status of training needed to support
     the mission for which a UTC is designed (MISCAP). All personnel assigned to a UTC
     must have all required mission and skill level training completed IAW applicable
     directives and instructions at the time of assessment. Individual training not required by
     the UTC (MISCAP or manpower detail) will not affect the readiness assessment but will
     be captured for deployment readiness tracking.
     3.4.7.4. DELETED
     3.4.7.5. (Added-AMC) Personnel filling a UTC requirement may be considered
     available to deploy if the projected TDY completion date is more than 30 days prior to
     their report no later than date (RNLTD), separation date, or retirement date.
         3.4.7.5.1. (Added-AMC) When assessing the status of UTCs in ART, report skill
         level substitutions as either Yellow or Red, only if the substitutions are not
         specifically allowed in the UTC Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP). Report as
         follows: Yellow if the UTC can meet the MISCAP (include a remark specifying the
         skill level substitution). Red if the UTC cannot meet the MISCAP. This is not to be
         confused with skill level substitutions authorized during actual sourcing, as outlined
         in AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution.
  3.4.8. Commanders are expected to use their judgment during assessments of missing or
  deficient capabilities (i.e. shortage of one computer may not make a UTC red; shortage of
  one generator may, similarly a member on a 72 hour medical profile would not require a
AFI10-244_AMCSUP_FAIRCHILDAFBSUP_I 1 MAY 2012                                                    25


   UTC status change, whereas a person with a broken leg would). Remarks should reflect
   training requirements and/or resource actions necessary to improve the readiness status.
   3.4.9. In addition and independent of the stoplight (Green, Yellow, Red) assessment, each
   unit will indicate if a UTC is tasked to deploy and, if tasked, whether it can meet theater
   specific requirements including line remarks IAW timing criteria.
   3.4.10. When substitutions, not explicitly allowed in the MISCAP but authorized IAW AFI
   10-401 guidance, are used in ART reporting, they will be noted using the Standard
   Assessment Remark of AFSC, Skill Level Training or Grade, and drive at a minimum a
   "Yellow" UTC assessment.
   3.4.11. If a portion of a UTC is tasked to deploy, the remaining assets continue to be
   available for the entire deployment eligibility window. Commanders should indicate this in a
   remark.
   3.4.12. Commanders will continue to submit an overall UTC assessment that treats the
   deployed portion of that UTC as available and healthy unless circumstances/information
   warrants otherwise. Commanders will also continue to submit an overall UTC assessment for
   complete UTCs that have deployed. If a UTC is deployed and was being assessed as Green,
   commanders will continue to assess the UTC as Green unless circumstances/information
   warrants otherwise. For UTCs that were deployed while being assessed Yellow or Red,
   commanders will continue with that assessment until circumstances/information warrants
   upgrading the assessment.
3.5. Assess the overall health of a UTC. The UTC represents a capability that is assessed
using the category areas described in paragraph 3.4.7. The overall assessment will be rated using
the following guidelines and the ART Monitor Assessment checklist (Attachment 2).
   3.5.1. Green. The complete UTC to include the exact MANFOR and LOGFOR equipment
   with only MISCAP explicit substitutions and all training for the AEF allocated UTC are
   available for deployment within 72 hours of notification or sooner if subject to more stringent
   criteria.
   3.5.1. (AMC) If a UTC is coded “Green” and cannot meet all or part of its MISCAP during
   an IG inspection, UTC will receive an “Unsatisfactory” or “Marginal” grade. The affected
   unit will change the UTC‟s ART status to reflect the correct assessment (yellow or red) and
   provide the rationale for not being green with an associated Get Well Date. HQ AMC/IG will
   forward the "Yellow" or "Red" UTCs to the applicable MAJCOM FAM(s) and courtesy
   copy AMC/A3OCR to ensure accurate ART reporting. Once corrective actions have been
   completed and the Wing/CC or equivalent determines the UTC can meet its full MISCAP,
   unit will return the UTC ART status to “Green.”
   3.5.2. Yellow. The UTC has a missing or deficient MANFOR or LOGFOR requirement; but
   that missing or deficient capability does not prevent the UTC from being tasked and
   accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation. This includes AFI 10-403
   approved standard substitutions. Provide a detailed explanation in remarks. Describe the
   condition, the corrective action and provide a projected get-well date. In the event that a skill
   level or grade is dependent only on a members‟ promotion it still needs to be noted and still
   drives a „Yellow‟ state.
26                            AFI10-244_AMCSUP_FAIRCHILDAFBSUP_I 1 MAY 2012


  3.5.3. Red = No Go. The UTC has a missing or deficient capability that prevents the UTC
  from being tasked and accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation.
  Provide detailed explanation of the shortfall in remarks. Describe the shortfall, the corrective
  action and provide a get-well date.
  3.5.3. (AMC) Red = No Go. The UTC has a missing or deficient capability that prevents the
  UTC from being tasked and accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation
  based on the UTC MISCAP statement. However, residual capability with the UTC may still
  be capable of supporting its theater specific tasking.
  3.5.4. Incorrectly Postured. This rating is to be used when a UTC is postured against a unit
  in ART and the unit commander believes this to be in error. Assigning this rating in ART
  will generate an email to the MAJCOM ART POC, raising the issue with the MAJCOM
  FAM to help determine whether or not the UTC is correctly postured. A detailed explanation
  is to be provided in the email of why the UTC should not be postured against your unit. This
  information will be forwarded to the MAJCOM UTC FAM ,who postured the UTC against
  the unit, for coordination and resolution.
  3.5.5. Think of the monthly assessment as a Yes/No process (Figure 3.1). Additionally, a
  Yes/No process can be used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it can meet
  theater specific requirements (Figure 3.2).
  3.5.6. (Added-AMC) Assess UTCs when determined to be “bad" or "incorrectly postured”.
  Input specific rationale as to why the UTC is suspected of being bad or incorrectly postured
  using the appropriate comment area on the deficiency screen. For "incorrectly postured"
  UTCs, input the AMC UTC FAM's email address (listing provided at
  (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=20703).
AFI10-244_AMCSUP_FAIRCHILDAFBSUP_I 1 MAY 2012                                            27


Figure 3.1. Monthly Assessment Process.




3.6. Tasked to Deploy Assessment. Upon deployment notification, commanders owning
UTC‟s tasked to deploy, in whole or in part, are required to assess the UTCs ability to meet
theater specific requirements to include line remarks. Each unit commander‟s UTC tasking
assessment is the Air Force‟s certification of forces. This assessment is independent of the
overall UTC stoplight assessment. As an example, a UTC may not have a person with specific
skill level and experience required by line remarks, however the UTC status (Green, Yellow,
Red) does not change since the stoplight assessment is based on the UTCs ability to deploy
anywhere in the world at the time of the assessment. Another example is a Red UTC assessment
due to equipment which could be tasked to support a personnel only theater requirement. Even
though it can meet that specific deployment tasking, the overall status is still Red.
   3.6.1. A Yes/No process can be used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it
   can meet theater specific requirements (Figure 3.2).
   3.6.2. (Added-AMC) When a UTC is partially tasked and the unit can meet the theater
   requirements, mark tasked line numbers within the UTC as “Tasked – Yes”, and mark “Yes”
   or “No” whether the line number is deployed. Then identify that the UTC can meet its
   tasking, (e.g., “Can Meet – Yes”). Overall UTC assessment does not change when partially
   tasked.
 28                             AFI10-244_AMCSUP_FAIRCHILDAFBSUP_I 1 MAY 2012


   3.6.3. (Added-AMC) When indicating “Meets – No” outline the planned action (i.e. waiver
   requested, training scheduled, or shortfall to be submitted) in the tasked remark area. Units
   will continually update the tasked remark area with the status of the waiver request or
   reclama until final disposition.
       3.6.3.1. (Added-AMC) ART must be updated immediately with concise information
       identifying: The shortfall condition (i.e. condition 1 – 5), Shortfall justification to include
       authorized and assigned personnel, and ability to fulfill any other AFSC or equipment
       requirements.
       3.6.3.2. (Added-AMC) When possible, units tasked to deploy under a non-postured
       UTC will identify a postured UTC with similar requirements and mark it as “Tasked -
       Yes” and “Meets - Yes.” The unit must identify the actual tasked UTC in the general
       remark area.

Figure 3.2. Tasked to Deploy Assessment Process.




3.7. Remarks. Plain language supplemental remarks are a critical component of the ART report
and are used as a management tool. Remarks are required if a unit is less than fully capable in
any reportable area. Remarks are used to identify trends and to redirect resources if necessary.
Remarks are mandatory for UTCs assessed Yellow and Red. All status remarks will be
standardized remarks from Standard Assessment Remarks listing maintained within ART (ART
Guidance under Information Tab) only. However, the Commander‟s Remarks section is an
additional avenue that should be utilized to relay vital information that affects the readiness or
availability of the UTC. This area of ART can be utilized regardless of the readiness status of the
UTC (i.e., Green, Yellow, or Red).
AFI10-244_AMCSUP_FAIRCHILDAFBSUP_I 1 MAY 2012                                                   29


3.7. (AMC)Remarks. Unit ART Monitors must provide rank, last name, and Defense Switched
Network (DSN) number when entering free text remarks on any of the Remark Fields as its last
line. For example: “TSgt Buck B. Buck at DSN: (312)779-2323.”
   3.7.1. Commanders use the remarks and associated get-well-dates (GWD) to explain and
   amplify data contained in ART reports. Write remarks in plain text English and ensure they
   contain all appropriate details such as AFSCs, projected improvements, workarounds, etc.
   Remarks should be sufficient to allow responsible managers to take specific corrective
   action. The remarks sections are not size limited.
   3.7.2. As applicable, list resource types with associated deficiencies; state numbers required,
   assigned, and available; explain the cause of the problem, if known; identify previously
   requested assistance; identify remedial actions in progress, highlight further actions required,
   and provide a projection of when the readiness status will change.
   3.7.3. Air Force standard abbreviations are acceptable. However, non-common, unique, or
   unit/system/functional specific acronyms will be defined when first used in a report. Do not
   refer to previous reports (ART is dynamic and will not retain previous remarks).
   3.7.4. Wing Commanders should challenge inadequate remarks. MAJCOMs will sample,
   review, and assess adequacy of unit remarks.
3.8. When to Report. All Air Force and Air Force gained units will submit and update UTC
assessments every 30 calendar days. The Air Force goal for on-time reporting is 97%.
3.8. (AMC)When to Report. All AMC and AMC gained units (upon activation under Title 10)
will submit and update the overall UTC health assessments every 31 calendar days. This update
will be accomplished no earlier than the 20th and no later than the 25th of each month.
   3.8.1. Upon notification of a significant event that changes the assessment of a UTC the unit
   commander will submit an out-of-cycle report within 24 hours of the change. This includes
   notification of a UTC change or addition.
   3.8.1. (AMC) All AMC and AMC gained units (upon activation under Title 10) will check
   ART every Tuesday and Thursday for Not Reported UTCs. These UTCs will be assessed
   within 24 hours.
   3.8.2. Additionally, commanders owning UTC's tasked to deploy will submit via ART an
   assessment of their ability to support the tasking, including theater specific requirements,
   within five (5) days of receipt of a deployment notification.
   3.8.3. Units owning a UTC tasked to deploy will reset the deployment status from "Yes" to
   "No" not later than five (5) calendar days after the tasked resources return to home station.
3.9. Where to Report. ART is accessed from the AFPC/DPW homepage located at the
following URL https://aefcenter.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil/. Click on the “AEF UTC
Reporting Tool” link. Users are required to have SIPRNET access in order to submit ART
updates.

                                 ART MONITOR ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST

         Table A2.1. ART Monitor Assessment Checklist.
All units MUST use this checklist as a tool to assess UTC Personnel, Training, Equipment/   Current AEF
Supplies and Equipment Condition (PTEC) monthly in ART. ALWAYS consider what the
UTC's MISCAP states when assessing.
GREEN = There are absolutely NO UTC deficiencies in any of the four assessed areas          G
YELLOW = UTC can meet MISCAP but there are deficiencies to be noted                             Y
RED = UTC cannot meet MISCAP due to too many deficiencies                                            R
BLACK = UTC is postured incorrectly and requires MAJCOM FAM attention.

Check the appropriate shaded block (G, Y, R) below, depending on how you answer the question. The
lowest rating in any area will drive the overall rating of the UTC. Any deficiencies must have remarks
and Get Well Dates (GWD); check each month for expiration. Only the FINAL rating is used in ART.
Refer to the MISCAP, MANFOR, LOGFOR, MILPDS, AFI 10-244 (Ch 3), AFI 10-401 and AFI 10-403.

Once an individual is associated to an AEF they cannot be changed without obtaining a MAJCOM/CV
waiver IAW AFI 10-401, 9.7.6
A: PERSONNEL
1 MANNING: Are all position numbers in the UTC, as outlined by the MANFOR, filled by
assigned personnel?
a     Yes.                                                                               G
