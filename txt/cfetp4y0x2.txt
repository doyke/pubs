Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and
training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support
resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty. In addition, the CFETP
provides personnel a clear career path to success. NOTE: Civilians occupying associated
positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts supervisors use to plan, manage, and control training within
the specialty.

2.1. Part I: Provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A
provides general information; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties
and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each skill
level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training, and other);
Section D indicates resource constraints; and Section E identifies transition training guide
requirements.

2.2. Part II: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties,
tasks technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC)
conducted training, core and critical tasks, and correspondence course requirements; Section B
contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if
Airmen satisfied training requirements; Section C identifies available support materials (i.e.
Qualification Training Packages); Section D identifies the training course index supervisors can
use to determine resources available to support training. Included in Section D are both
mandatory and optional courses; and Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training
requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for associated
qualification needs. At the unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan,
and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. Documentation of
training is outlined in section F via the use of the Air Force Training Record (AFTR); this
section outlines the format and documentation necessary to maintain an AFTR.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP ensures individuals in this specialty receive effective
and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan enables us to train
today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.

                                               PART II

Section A - Specialty Training Standard

1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes
beginning 1 April 2014.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Attachment 2, this STS:

2.1. Lists in column 1, the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TRs) necessary
for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill levels. TRs in the source summary are
commercial publications or other service publications that are essential for OJT and mission
accomplishment and are referenced by title throughout the STS. The unit OJT section will
consolidate the requirements for the unit they support and order publications through the
hospital/clinic library activity.

2.2. Uses the numbers 5 or 7 in column 2A, to identify core tasks required for upgrade to the 5- and
7-skill levels respectively in the dental laboratory specialty. Personnel must be trained on appropriate
core and duty tasks to complete upgrade training. Not all tasks require third party certification.
The symbol “X” in column 2B identifies critical tasks; these are the only tasks that require
third party certification.

2.3. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge
training requirements. Use automated training management systems, if available, to document
technician qualifications. Task certification must show a certification or completion date.

NOTE: Trainers must (1) possess a 4Y0XX AFSC or DoD equivalent, (2) be qualified on the tasks
they will train, (3) be recommended by their supervisor, and (4) have completed the Air Force
Training Course. Certifiers must (1) be at least a SSgt or civilian equivalent, (2) possess a minimum
of 5-skill level, (3) have completed the Air Force Training Course, and (4) be trained and/or certified
on tasks they will certify. The certification official must be someone other than the trainer.
Licensed/credentialed healthcare providers may substitute as trainers and certifiers without attending
the Air Force Training Course. If the trainer is a licensed/credentialed provider, they may serve as
both the trainer and certifier.

2.4. Shows in column 4, formal training, correspondence course and QTP requirements. It also
shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the trainee as a result of training on the task
and career knowledge provided by the correspondence course. For a list of QTP volume numbers
and titles, refer to Section C. Note: Training codes in columns 4B2 and 4C2 reflected for 5- and 7-
skill levels indicate the information provided in the CDCs. These codes are not intended to reflect
the level required to satisfy OJT upgrade requirements.




                                                   19
2.5. Identifies qualification requirements. The proficiency code key indicates the level of training
and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.

2.6. Is used to document training in the Air Force Training Record. Refer to AFI 36-2201, Chapter 6
for further guidance on documentation, transcription, decertification, and recertification.

2.7. Is used as a performance standard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the “Go” level. “Go”
means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local demands for accuracy,
timeliness, and correct use of procedures (“Go” level equates to 3c in the STS proficiency code key).

2.8. Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System
(WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) for the dental career field are developed at the USAF
Airman Advancement Division by dental SNCOs with extensive practical experience in their career
field. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team
members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study
references listed in the Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog. WAPS is not
applicable to the Air National Guard.

3. Recommendations. Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates,
inadequacies and recommended changes to this training standard to the 937 TRG/TGE, 2931 Harney,
Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 or use the Customer Service Information Line, DSN 420-1080
(commercial 210-808-1080) to report your findings. Be sure to reference specific STS paragraphs in
the report.

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a
specific task. (Example: b and 1b)
** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific
task, or for a subject common to several tasks.
- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.

NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.

6.3. Exportable Enlisted Specialty Training Courses: None

6.4. Courses Under Development/Revision: All

Section E - MAJCOM Unique Requirements

7. There are currently no MAJCOM unique requirements.

Section F - Documenting Training

8. The Air Force Training Record (AFTR).

8.1. The AFTR is an enterprise-wide custom training management system designed to replace the
paper-based training records system. It is the electronic equivalent of an AF Form 623 and will be
used by career fields within the Air Force Medical Service to document all training actions. The
AFTR allows training plans to be established by:

8.1.1. Career Field/Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)

8.1.2. Duty position/team member

8.1.3. Any group of tasks that require management, tracking, and documentation


                                                 35
8.1.4. Trainee/trainer/certifier

8.2. The AFTR components managed by the supervisor are:

8.2.1. Master Task List (MTL). The MTL is a list containing all the tasks that are to be trained in a
work center and is often broken out by specialty. The MTL consists of the Specialty Training
Standard; AF Form 623 Parts II and III; AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation
and Command JQS and AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training
tasks; and Qualification Training Packages. The supervisor creates the MTL by selecting tasks from
the Unit Task List (UTL) produced by the Unit Training Manager (UTM) and the STS.

8.2.2. Master Training Plan (MTP). The MTP is a list containing a schedule of training for all tasks
within a particular duty position. The MTP consists of the STS; 623 Parts II and III; AF Force Forms
797 and 1098 tasks; and QTPs. The supervisor creates the MTP by assigning training times and
methods to tasks in the duty position. Refer to AFI 36-2201, and AFH 36-2235, Volume 11,
Information for Designers of Instructional Systems Application to Unit Training, for guidance in
developing the MTP.

 8.2.3. Duty Task List (DTL). The DTL is a list containing all the tasks to be trained on in a duty
position. The DTL consists of the STS; AF Form 623 Parts II and III; AF Force Forms 797 and 1098
tasks; and QTPs. The supervisor creates the DTL by selecting tasks from the MTL.

8.2.4. Individual Training Record (ITR). All training is documented in the ITR. This is the
electronic version of the former Enlisted Training and Competency Folder. The ITR is made up of
the AF Form 623 Parts I, II and III; AF Forms 623a, 797, 803 and 1098; QTPs and the Job
Qualification Standard (JQS). This record is automatically populated based upon the duty position
the individual is assigned to. Refer to AFI 36-2201, for guidance in documenting training on the
various forms contained within the ITR. Maintenance of the CFETP is mandatory for all MSgts
and below assigned to dental facilities.

8.2.4.1. The AFTR provides the capability to incorporate training source documents and/or to
manually enter completed training into the ITR. The following documents will be incorporated into
the ITR:

8.2.4.1.1. The member’s initial MTF and clinic orientation checklists.

8.2.4.1.2. A copy of career field-relevant training certificates or certifications/licenses, such as dental
short course certificates, Dental Hygiene License, or Certified Dental Assistant/Certified Dental
Laboratory Technician certifications.

8.2.4.1.3. Recurrent training such as BLS and HIPAA.

8.2.4.1.4. AF Form 2096, Classification On-The-Job Training Action.




                                                    36
8.2.4.1.5. Medical Education & Training Campus (METC) Student Training Report (STR). METC
STR documents the level of success, strengths, and weaknesses that a student demonstrated during
technical school. It is emailed to the base training manager shortly after the graduate arrives at his/her
duty station. This form is maintained in the record until 5-skill level upgrade training is complete.

8.2.4.1.6. AF Form 803, Report of Task Evaluation. AF Form 803 is used to conduct and
document completion of task evaluations during training SAVs, when directed by the commander, or
when a task certification requires validation.

8.2.4.1.7. Other forms as appropriate.

Section G - Samples of ITR Documentation

9. The following are sample forms available in AFTR to document enlisted training.

9.1 AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS. The AF Form 797
(Figure 9-1) will be used to document training for tasks that are not otherwise documented in the
CFETP.

Document on AF Form 623A the start and completion dates of Unit Orientation, and reference the
date of the orientation checklist. In addition, document the member’s entry into upgrade training,
initial evaluation results, and periodic evaluations of training progress to include CDC progress.
Information on extensions, waiver requests, or breaks in training should be clearly documented.
Document on the AF Form 623A any decertification proceedings, including dates, reasons for
decertification, and other applicable information. Accomplish an initial evaluation when a new
person arrives to the clinic or when an individual changes duty positions. Document all other actions
pertaining to training IAW AFI-36-2201, Air Force Training Program.

20 Jan 13 A1C Doe is assigned to the Dental Squadron on this date. I have been assigned as her
supervisor and trainer and will orient A1C Doe to the squadron using the Dental Squadron
orientation checklist located in the Master Training Plan dated 20 Apr 12. An initial interview was
accomplished on this date. A1C Doe currently has no disqualifiers that would delay her
orientation/training. A1C Doe stated that her goals during the orientation process were to learn as
much as possible and to question the trainers when she was not clear as to the training provided.
A1C Doe seems to be very enthusiastic about working in the Dental Laboratory Flight and has
expressed her desire to take on any challenges that the trainers have to offer. An initial evaluation
was conducted. Additional training in the following areas is needed to meet the work centers
position tasks qualifications: A1C Doe was previously qualified on required work center tasks.
These qualifications will be re-verified prior to release from unit orientation.

20 Feb 13 A mid-orientation progress check was accomplished on this date. A1C Doe has
progressed through the dental clinic orientation dated 20 Jan 13, with little to no difficulty. She

                         INITIAL UPGRADE TRAINING ORIENTATION
                                    (Trainee Orientation)

A1C Doe is entering upgrade training to the 5-skill level effective this date. She has been briefed on
the On-The-Job Training (OJT) Program and how she fits into the program while in upgrade training
(UGT). Upgrade training was explained as a dual-channel process designed to qualify an Airman for
skill level upgrade. Dual-channel OJT is a systematic reportable application of self-study and the
craftsman/apprentice principle. Trainees acquire job qualification while performing on the job under
supervision. This combination, knowledge and job position qualification constitutes the dual-channel
concept. Requirements from AFI 36-2101 and 36-2201 were covered. AF Forms 623, 623A, 797,
2096, and the CFETP, STS/JQS or automated JQS, which serves to make up the individual training
record, were explained. Responsibilities of the commander, base training, unit education and training
manager (UTM), immediate supervisor, trainer, and trainee were discussed. The career development
course (CDC) was briefly discussed and will be explained in detail during the CDC briefing.
Requirements for upgrade to AFSC 4Y052 are: (1) satisfactory completion of CDC 4Y052, (2)
satisfactory completion of all appropriate skill level core and duty related tasks, and (3) supervisor
recommendation for upgrade. Each Airman in grades E-1 through E-7 has an AF Form 623, and
CFETP or JQS. The CFETP or JQS contains most duty related tasks and should be annotated to show
training has or is occurring in those tasks the airman is required to perform in his/her current duty
position, all AFECD mandatory requirements for upgrade, and core task requirements. In the CFETP,
the trainer, trainee, and certifier (as applicable) have a space to initial when training is completed.
After upgrade, the CFETP or JQS will continue to be used to document further qualification training.
