     1.1. The 35th Maintenance Group (MXG) Commander is responsible for the CDDAR
     program. Procedures must follow Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) and
     federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines.
     1.2. Wreckage will not be disturbed IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports,
     with the exception of essential rescue operations. Wreckage may be moved to prevent
     interference with vital air operations as deemed necessary by 35 FW/CC or the Incident
     Commander (IC). Refer to Misawa AB Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan
     (CEMP) 10-2.
     1.3. Commanders and Staff Agency Chiefs/Noncommissioned Officers in Charge (NCOIC)
     are responsible for ensuring compliance with this instruction.
     1.4. All personnel involved in crash recovery operations will adhere to training and safety
     procedures established in governing directives and standards.
     1.5. The 35th Transient Alert/Crash Recovery Section (35 MXS/MXMMT) will develop
     wing CDDAR procedures, coordinated through Fire Emergency Services (CES/CEF),
     Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE) (AMDS/SGPB), CE Readiness and Emergency
     Management (CES/CEX), Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) (CES/CED), Wing Safety
     (FW/SE), Airfield Management (OSS/OSA), Maintenance Operations Center (MOC)
     (MOS/MXOOM), Security Forces (SFS) and Quality Assurance, IAW AFI 21-

5. Crash Recovery Response Procedures:
     5.1. Normal Response:
        5.1.1. The CRT will consist of a recovery supervisor and two recovery members. The
        CRTS will respond with one CRTM in the primary crash recovery vehicle. The second
        CRTM will standby with an aircraft tow vehicle for further guidance from the CRTS. The
        CRTS will establish and maintain radio contact with the IC on the fire/crash net.
        5.1.2. If upon landing the aircraft stops on the active runway, the IC will determine if
        hazards exist. If an explosive hazard exists, the IC will contact EOD to render
        safe/eliminate the hazard. Once the hazards are eliminated, the IC will direct the fire
        dispatch center to contact the MOC to coordinate with the applicable AMU to de-
        arm/remove munitions from the aircraft. Once notified, the CRTS is clear to begin
        recovery operations.
        5.1.3. The CRT will establish interphone/hand signal communication with the aircraft
        commander, and if no further assistance is required, the CRT will clear the aircraft to taxi
        to End of Runway (EOR) and be de-armed by the EOR crew. The IC will terminate the
        IFE when the scene is safe.
        5.1.4. If further assistance is required, the CRTS will supervise normal engine shutdown
        procedures on the runway. The CRT will, with the pilot as brake rider (unless requiring
        medical attention), tow the aircraft to an open parking location at either West or East
        EOR. The EOR crew will respond to de-arm the aircraft. The CRTS will then contact
        the appropriate AMU and request the AMU send a tow crew to retrieve the aircraft from
        EOR or, based on mission requirements, tow the aircraft to its squadron location. Once
        the aircraft has cleared the runway, the IC will terminate the IFE.
     5.2. Major Response:
        5.2.1. The CRT will consist of a recovery supervisor and three recovery members. The
        CRTS will respond with one CRTM in the primary crash recovery vehicle. A second
        CRTM will standby with an aircraft tow vehicle for further guidance from the CRTS,
        while the remaining CRTM will assist as necessary.
        5.2.2. The CRTS will, if required, notify the 35 MXS Munitions Flight, Munitions
        Control (35 MXS/MXMWSC) to dispatch a driver and MHU-110 trailer. The CRTS will
        establish and maintain radio contact with the IC on the fire/crash net.
35FWI21-102 30 MAY 2013                                                                        7


     5.2.3. Emergency Power Unit (EPU) Activations:
        5.2.3.1. Upon landing, the aircraft will taxi to EOR or Hot Cargo Pad based on
        approach angle. The IC will establish an appropriate cordon and the fire/crash crew
        will install wheel chocks, pin landing gear, perform engine shutdown procedures, and
        then pin the EPU. The fire/crash crew will egress the pilot utilizing the crew 60 bottle
        (emergency escape cylinder). NOTE: The IC may expand the cordon size with HRT
        recommendation or as the situation warrants when hydrazine danger exists.
        5.2.3.2. The HRT supervisor will verify with the IC that no fire or explosive hazard
        exists.
        5.2.3.3. The HRT will replace the fire/crash crew’s EPU safety pin with one of its
        own and clear/safe the EPU system IAW LCL-35FW-221, Hydrazine Response
        Checklist.
        5.2.3.4. Once the IC declares the scene is safe, the HRT will contact the MOC who
        will coordinate with the applicable AMU to complete the recovery of the aircraft. At
        this time, the HRT will recover their EPU safety pin and have the appropriate AMU
        insert their safety pin.
     5.2.4. Hot Brakes:
        5.2.4.1. The pilot, EOR crew, or CRT will be responsible for identifying potential or
        actual hot brake conditions.
        5.2.4.2. When an aircraft is declared as having a potential/actual hot brake condition,
        the IC will normally establish a 300-foot cordon and determine if a fire or explosive
        hazard exists. If an explosive hazard exists, the IC will direct the fire dispatch center
        to contact EOD. The IC will direct the fire dispatch center to contact the MOC to
        coordinate with the applicable AMU to de-arm/remove munitions from the aircraft.
        Once the hazards are eliminated, the IC will normally clear the CRT to begin
        recovery operations. CAUTION: It is impossible for the ground crew to avoid the
        hot brake and engine danger areas while installing the landing gear, EPU and wing
        tank pylon safety pins, or wheel chocks; therefore, the engine will be shut down
        without installing the aircraft safety pins or wheel chocks. (Reference T.O. 1F-
        16C/CG/CJ-1, Pilots Flight Manual)
        5.2.4.3. If the aircraft engine must be shutdown, the IC will contact the pilot using
        UHF/VHF radio to confirm the EPU switch is in the “OFF” position and instruct the
        pilot to hold the aircraft in position using minimal brake. After shutdown, if the
        wheel chalks have not been installed, the fire/crash crew will approach the aircraft
        from the nose and chalk the front landing gear.
        5.2.4.4. The pilot will remain in the cockpit until the brakes have cooled sufficiently.
        If the pilot must be extracted, 35 CES/CEF personnel will chock the nose tire before
        pilot extraction.
        5.2.4.5. The IC will normally terminate the emergency. The CRT and one fire/crash
        crew will monitor the aircraft.
        5.2.4.6. After 45-60 minutes, the CRT will approach the wheel area from the front or
        rear only and examine to ensure enough heat has dissipated to safely tow the aircraft.
8                                                              35FWI21-102 30 MAY 2013


       When it is safe to approach the aircraft, the CRT will install the remainder of the
       safety pins and wheel chocks and EOR will de-arm the aircraft. The CRTS will
       notify MOC and applicable AMU to dispatch a tow team to tow the aircraft to its
       parking spot.
    5.2.5. Hung Flare:
       5.2.5.1. The IFE aircraft will taxi to EOR or Hot Cargo pad depending on approach
       angle. The IC will establish a cordon and determine if a fire or explosive hazard
       exists.
       5.2.5.2. The IC will contact EOD with the location and nature of the emergency.
       5.2.5.3. EOD will clear/safe the flare dispenser IAW applicable EOD 60 Series of
       T.Os. Once the fire or explosive hazard is eliminated, the IC will clear the CRTS to
       resume operations. The CRTS will establish interphone communication with the
       aircraft commander and supervise installation of the landing gear, EPU, wing tank
       pylon, chaff/flare and arresting hook safety pins.
       5.2.5.4. The CRTS will supervise engine shutdown procedures and egress the pilot.
       5.2.5.5. The CRTS will then clear the area. The IC will terminate the emergency
       once the flare is clear/safe. MOC will notify the applicable AMU to dispatch a tow
       team to tow the aircraft to its parking spot.
    5.2.6. Blown Tires:
       5.2.6.1. If upon landing the aircraft stops on the active runway, the IC will determine
       if hazards exist. If an explosive hazard exists, the IC will direct the fire dispatch
       center to contact EOD to respond to the scene, and safe the munitions. Once the scene
       is safe, the IC will direct the fire dispatch center to contact the MOC to coordinate
