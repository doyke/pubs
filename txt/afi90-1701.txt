                                           Chapter 1

                          OVERVIEW AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Overview. This publication provides guidance on office responsibilities and the Energy
Program. The AFI establishes the cross-functional governance and management structure at all
levels of the Air Force to execute the Energy Policy. Energy is defined as any usable power,
including but not limited to, coal, petroleum products, steam, electricity, natural gas, propane,
military operational fuels and propellants, alternative fuels and renewable energy including, but
not limited to, synthetic and biomass-derived fuels, solar, wind, geothermal, and nuclear, but
excluding nuclear energy used in ship propulsion.
   1.1.1. Energy availability and management is critical to Air Force readiness. Energy enables
   the Air Force to deliver its designed capabilities without unacceptable delay, and is essential
   for successful accomplishment of the mission. Energy availability and security impacts all
   Air Force missions, operations, and organizations and supports the Air Force’s priorities.
   The Air Force must have reliable energy supplies. Energy enables the Air Force to develop
   and care for Airmen and their families during training and in daily living. New energy
   technology will be incorporated into systems as the Air Force modernizes aircraft, satellites,
   and equipment.
   1.1.2. As the Department of Defense’s (DoD) largest energy consumer, the Air Force is
   taking a leadership role in developing Energy Strategies, Visions, and Programs to reduce
   energy consumption across missions. The Air Force is the renewable energy leader in the
   federal government and seeks to expand its renewable energy portfolio through public-
   private partnership. For example, the Air Force is expanding its use of alternative jet fuel to
   reduce demand on foreign oil and remain good environmental stewards.
   1.1.3. It is imperative that the Air Force continually refine its energy programs and create a
   culture that is mindful of the footprint we leave on the environment, and yet produces lethal
   combat power yielding sovereign options for America. This guidance, and the additional
   training and educating of the total force to conserve and use energy wisely, enables the Air
   Force to build the foundation for a culture that will continuously reduce energy consumption
   and identify and use new energy sources effectively. This guidance directs energy actions
   within the Air Force so it can remain in a leadership position and meet mission responsibility.
   1.1.4. Many organizations throughout the Air Force have energy responsibility as part of
   their primary mission responsibilities but there has been no single organization that has had a
   primary mission of global energy management or has visibility of all energy efforts. A single
   organization must be responsible for energy management to ensure the Air Force is able to
   meet the increased federal energy goals and coordinate energy efforts throughout the Air
   Force.
   1.1.5. The Air Force’s Energy Plan is to “Reduce Demand, Increase Supply, and Change the
   Culture.” Each element of the Plan is equally important. The Air Force’s energy vision is to
   “Make Energy a Consideration in All We Do.” The vision is the foundation of the Energy
   Plan and assigns energy responsibility to all Air Force personnel.

                  ENERGY PROGRAM MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE

13.1. Background. Many organizations throughout the Air Force have energy responsibility as
part of their primary mission responsibilities but there has been no single organization that has a
primary mission of global energy management or has visibility of all energy efforts. A single
organization must be responsible for energy management to ensure the Air Force is able to meet
the increased federal energy goals and coordinate energy efforts throughout the Air Force.
13.2. Air Force Senior Energy Official. The Secretary of the Air Force established the
SAF/US as the Senior Energy Official. This instruction provides guidance on the role of the
Senior Energy Official as the Energy Program Manager who is responsible for establishing an
overall Air Force Energy Program. The Energy Program Manager adds the necessary structure
to enable the Air Force to operate its energy programs efficiently and effectively. It does not
change the energy responsibility Commanders’ currently have within their organizations.
SAF/US designated SAF/IE to serve as the OPR for the Air Force supporting the Under
Secretary’s role as the Senior Energy Official and overseeing program implementation at the
MAJCOMs, DRUs, and FOAs.
13.3. Energy Program Management Office. The Headquarters Air Force EPMO is
established to provide overarching Air Force energy management and is under the oversight of
the Air Force’s Energy Program Manager, SAF/US, in coordination with the Vice Chief of Staff
of the Air Force. The EPMO is the coordinating body to provide oversight of cross-cutting Air
Force energy issues and supports all Air Force energy programs. SAF/US delegates
responsibility for the EPMO and overarching Air Force Energy Program to SAF/IE. The
Director of the EPMO is SAF/IE. Day-to-day operations of the EPMO will be managed by
SAF/IEE. Figure 13.1, on the following page, depicts a high level overview of the Air Force
Energy Program Structure.

                                                                                                  Installations


13.4. Energy Management Offices and Points of Contact. Headquarters Air Force offices
and FOAs will designate at a minimum Point of Contact (POC) responsible for energy
management issues for the office. MAJCOMs, the ANG, and DRUs exercising custody and
control over real-estate will designate an office responsible for energy management. The energy
management office conducts the day-to-day energy operations for each organization and is the
single POC for energy issues. Each organization’s energy management POC or office will be
responsible for energy policy execution and compliance, and developing, as appropriate, plans
and programs that are specifically applicable to their organizations to support or supplement Air
Force energy goals and strategies. Each organization is responsible to provide the right level of
staffing in proportion to the size of their energy mission. Organizations such as AF/A3/5 or
AF/A4/7 will have larger staff than smaller organizations without a direct energy missions.
Organizations with smaller energy missions may chose to assign energy management to an office
as a collateral duty. The energy management office’s role differs from the EMSG. The energy
management office provides the day-to-day energy operations for the organization, while the
EMSG provides the structure to bring together all reporting organizations together to resolve
complex energy issues at the HAF, MAJCOM, DRU, or installation level.
13.5. Chain of Command for Energy Offices. The establishment of the Energy Offices at
HAF, MAJCOMs, DRUs, and installations does not alter the established chain of command for
the office with the energy designation. Any tasking or reporting requirements from the Energy
Program Manager will follow the established chain of command and offices are expected to
follow their chain of command structure when responding. The designation of an office that is
responsible for energy establishes a single POC for all energy issues within the organization.
13.6. Energy Management Steering Group. Each level of command (Headquarters,
MAJCOM, DRU, and installation) will establish an EMSG, or similarly named organization.
The Energy SFG is the EMSG for HAF.
AFI90-1701 16 JULY 2009                                                                    35


  13.6.1. Scope. The EMSG is the focal point for energy-related matters at that organizational
  level.
  13.6.2. Goals. The goal of the EMSG is to coordinate all energy matters within the
  applicable level.
  13.6.3. Objectives. The objective of the EMSG is to achieve the goals outlined in the Air
  Force Energy Plan (Chapter 2).
  13.6.4. Authority. AFPD 90-17 Energy Management.
  13.6.5. Program Reviews. Each installation EMSG shall provide quarterly updates and
  activity reports to the MAJCOM, and all MAJCOM EMSGs shall report quarterly to
  SAF/IEE, which will provide reports to the EPMO.
  13.6.6. Membership. Membership and leadership of the EMSG is at the discretion of the
  MAJCOM, DRU, or installation commander but shall include, at a minimum, representatives
  from all major energy managing activities, including civil engineering, public affairs,
  transportation operations, budget, aircraft maintenance and operations, logistics, and fuels
  management. The EMSG provides a forum for coordinating energy activities and for
  conducting the Air Force Energy Plan. EMSGs at MAJCOMs, DRUs, and installations shall
  be chaired by the Commander or Vice Commander.

Energy—Any usable power, including but not limited to coal, petroleum products, steam,
electricity, natural gas, propane, military operational fuels and propellants, alternative fuels and
renewable energy, including, but not limited to synthetic and biomass-derived fuels, solar, wind,
geothermal, and nuclear, but excluding nuclear energy used in ship propulsion..
Energy intensity—The total amount of energy used per square foot in a facility. This includes,
but is not limited to, electricity, natural gas, propane, heating oil, and coal. Reducing energy
intensity will reduce costs, greenhouse gases, and reduce the nation’s dependence on foreign oil.
Energy Management Steering Group (EMSG)— The focal point for energy-related matters.
The EMSG is chaired by the Commander or Vice-Commander with representatives from at least
the civil engineering, transportation, aircraft operations, budget, supply, public affairs,
contracting, acquisition, and fuels management organizations.
Energy Security—Energy security includes physical security of infrastructure and supply, and
continuity of operations.
Energy Star Label—The Energy Star label was introduced as a designation for commercial
buildings in 1999. Under Energy Star, commercial buildings are measured against diverse
performance metrics, and then scored on a scale of 1-100. Buildings earning 75 or better are
eligible for the Energy Star label. Energy Star buildings use on average 35% less energy than
typical buildings of similar size.
Greenhouse Gases—Greenhouse gases are atmospheric constituents that contribute to the
greenhouse effect. Without these gases the planet would be uninhabitable, however emissions of
greenhouse gases associated with industrial activity are contributing to climate change.
Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydroflourocarbons,
perflourocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
Improved Operations—Achieved efficiencies which include: maintaining energy systems in
peak operating condition; seeking more cost-effective sources of energy; and exploring
applications for alternative sources of energy.
Lifecycle Cost-Effective—Lifecycle cost-effective means the life-cycle costs of a product,
project, or measure are estimated to be equal to or less than the base case (i.e., current or
standard practice or product).
Low Greenhouse Gas Emitting Vehicle—Vehicles which emit low quantities of greenhouse
gasses. Each year, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will issue
guidance identifying the makes and model numbers of low greenhouse gas emitting vehicles.
Process Energy—Energy directly consumed in manufacturing, maintenance, equipment
overhaul, rehabilitation or refurbishment, destruction, warehousing, and similar processes.
Programmed Fuel Consumption—Adjusted programmed fuel consumption based on actual
flying hours.
Renewable Energy Technology—Renewable energy technology includes solar, wind, biomass,
landfill gas, ocean (including tidal, wave, current and thermal), geothermal, municipal solid
waste, or new hydroelectric generation capacity achieved from increased efficiency or additions
of new capacity at an existing hydroelectric project.
