Figure A7.1. Privacy Act Statement


AUTHORITY. Solicitation of personal information for USAF endorsed recognition programs is
subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 (Public Law 93-579, as codified in Title 5, United States Code
(U.S.C.), Section 552a, and published in Title 32, Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.), Section
806b, and is authorized by Federal Statutes (5 U.S.C. 301 and 10 U.S.C. 8012).
PURPOSE. The principal purpose for the information’s use is to provide publicity and
recognition through military and (or) civilian news media inherent to the recognition program.
ROUTINE USES. Routine uses may be made of the information by commanders and award
section board members at any level of command, by officials of private organizations sponsoring
award programs, and by information officials representing the military and/or civilian news
media.
DISCLOSURE. Voluntary. Furnishing the information is voluntary; failure to provide the
information will result in ending this consideration for recognition.
I have read the above statement, and I do authorize release of the personal information for the
specific award.

                               BOARD MEMBER’S GUIDANCE

A8.1. Members must be fair and impartial. Set aside any bias (positive or negative) and
evaluate based on the substance of the nomination packages. Evaluate quality and impact of the
accomplishments. Keep in mind it is not the “importance” of one’s job you’re rating, but what
the individual did within their job.
A8.2. You should compare the accomplishments of each nominee and then score accordingly.
Pay careful attention to the category criteria. Bullets listed in an incorrect category (for example,
a job performance-related bullet listed in the significant self-improvement category) may impact
the overall score. Within the 6-10 point system, using half point increments, you must
differentiate between nominees. Do not score each category independently. You should
evaluate them on the “whole-person” concept relative to each other. Things to look for in each
category are listed below.
A8.3. JOB PERFORMANCE IN PRIMARY DUTY: The member’s leadership and job
performance in their primary duty, including the development of new techniques, must have
contributed significantly to increase mission effectiveness during the calendar quarter/year. You
should be looking for individual accomplishments--not unit accomplishments.
A8.4. SIGNIFICANT SELF-IMPROVEMENT: The member must have shown this
improvement through off-duty education, achievements in professional or cultural societies or
associations, and development of creative abilities during the award period. Consider military
and civilian classes, professional development, self-development, etc. In general, voluntary self-
improvement may be more noteworthy than just attending a mandatory class the individual was
scheduled for.
A8.5. BASE OR COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT: The member should have contributed
tangibly or intangibly to the military or civilian community’s welfare. This includes
base/squadron/community involvement such as Top-3, booster club, coach of a youth athletic
team, scout leader, church elder, etc. Being a member of an organization is normally not as
strong as serving in a leadership position (president, secretary, coach, team leader, head
organizer, etc.).
A8.6. Appropriate recognition is very important. Review the packages with the time and effort
they deserve. When you’re finished, set them aside and if you have time, review them again.
A8.7. Once you have an established score for each nominee, identify the highest rated nominee
with a “1”, the second with a “2”, etc. No ties are allowed. If you have two packages that are
very close you must decide which to rate higher. (Remember this is a “whole person” program
and you are selecting who you think will best represent the organization using the scoring
criteria.)
A8.8. Total only the rankings. Low Score is winner.
A8.9. Do not reveal who won until after the winners are announced by Fourteenth Air Force
Commander, Vice Commander, or Command Chief Master Sergeant.

                            BOARD PRESIDENT’S GUIDANCE

A9.1. This guidance is to assist the president in ensuring the board runs smoothly and
professionally.
A9.2. Quarterly/Annual Board Members must not discuss board results until validated and
released. Winners names are only to be released by Fourteenth Air Force Commander, Vice
Commander, Command Chief Master Sergeant (enlisted packages) or Fourteenth Air Force
Chief of Personnel (officer and civilian packages).
A9.3. 14AF/CCCA will provide you the ranks, names, and units of your board members.
A9.4. Explain the criteria for review of packages. Members are to focus on the information
listed on the AF Form 1206 and grade packages accordingly. The amount of information
provided is not the determining factor. The quality of information provided for the period being
considered is paramount. Remind members that, to be fair and consistent in their scoring, they
MUST set aside all prejudices and evaluate the packages in accordance with the provided
guidelines. This honest and unbiased review will give our program the integrity and fairness it
deserves.
A9.5. JOB PERFORMANCE IN PRIMARY DUTY: The member’s leadership and job
performance in their primary duty, including the development of new techniques, must have
contributed significantly to increase mission effectiveness during the calendar quarter/year. You
should be looking for individual accomplishments--not unit accomplishments.
A9.6. SIGNIFICANT SELF-IMPROVEMENT: The member must have shown this
improvement through off-duty education, achievements in professional or cultural societies or
associations, and development of creative abilities during the award period. Consider military
and civilian classes, professional development, self-development, etc. In general, voluntary self-
improvement may be more noteworthy than just attending a mandatory class the individual was
scheduled for.
A9.7. BASE OR COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT: The member should have contributed
tangibly or intangibly to the military or civilian community’s welfare. This includes
base/squadron/community involvement such as Top-3, booster club, coach of a youth athletic
team, scout leader, church elder, etc. Being a member of an organization is normally not
A9.8. Ensure the nominees’ ranks and names are written on the score sheets provided.
A9.9. Total the raw scores, and rack and stack packages for each nominee.
A9.10. Once the board is finished scoring their nominations, board members need to date and
sign score sheets and turn in their folders along with the score sheets to the president. The board
president will then transfer the information to the board president score sheet and sign it.
A9.11. Thank members for their participation and efforts in making our recognition program a
meaningful and successful one.
