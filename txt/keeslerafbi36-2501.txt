and Job Performance (50 Pts), Significant Self-Improvement (25 Pts), and Community

Pts). A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.
     1.1. Timelines: A1Cs must meet the requirements in AFI36-2502, Table 2.1, and have 36
     Months time in service (TIS) and 20 months time in grade (TIG), or 28 months TIG,
     whichever occurs first, and be recommended by their commander.
        1.1.1. Other significant times are as follows:
     2.1. The 81st Training Wing Commander is the selection authority for the CBB. In addition,
     81 TRW/CC prescribes the procedures for large unit boards.
     2.2. The Military Personnel Section (MPS) will distribute SrA BTZ quotas each quarter.
     Commanders of large units (seven or more eligibles) will receive their own quotas.
     Commanders of small units (six or less eligibles) will aggregate their eligibles to the CBB.
     The 81 TRW/CC is the convening authority for the CBB. The MPS will convene a CBB for
     the 81 TRW/CC to consider all small unit eligibles competing for BTZ promotion.
     2.3. The MPS will determine quotas and distribution based on 15 percent of eligibles
     ―eligibles‖ pertains to Airmen who meet time-in-grade and time-in-service requirements.
     Approval authority for quota distribution is delegated to the MPS Commander.
     3.1. When a large unit board convenes, it must consist of at least three voting members in
     the grade of MSgt or higher, a nonvoting recorder in the grade of SrA or higher, and a board
     president in the grade of CMSgt. If a CMSgt is not available to the unit, another SNCO will
     be appointed by the unit’s commander to be the board president.
     3.2. The CBB will consist of four voting members in the grade of MSgt or higher (only one
     board member per group to include Wing & tenant units) , a nonvoting recorder in the grade
     of SrA or higher, and the board president, who will be the Wing Command Chief Master
     Sergeant (CCC) or a CMSgt designated by the CCC.
     4.1. Large units will receive their own quotas and make selections at the unit level.
     Commanders of large units will convene a board and follow the same procedures as the CBB.
     4.2. Small unit commanders will use the BTZ eligibility list and an appropriate evaluation
     process (e.g., a unit board, record review, recommendation from supervisors/first sergeants,
     etc.) to determine one nominee for the CBB. All small units with eligibles are authorized one
     nominee. The commander may, with the concurrence of the 81 TRW/CC, nominate more
     than one individual. However, this will be the exception and not the norm. When nominating
     more than one, the commander sends a letter to 81 FSS/FSMPD with information supporting
     the request for additional nomination(s) prior to the established suspense date. Letters
     received after the suspense date will not be considered. The 81 FSS/FSMPD will staff the
     request through the 81 TRW/CCC for the 81 TRW/CC approval/disapproval. Unit
     commanders underline the name(s) of the nominee on the eligibility list, sign the list, and
     return it to 81 FSS/FSMPD.
     4.3. All BTZ nominees are required to physically appear before the CBB and large unit
     selection boards. All nominees must be present in order to have a physical appearance board.
KEESLERAFBI36-2501 15 JULY 2009                                                                 3


  The only exception will be deployment or a similar circumstance (i.e., emergency leave).
  Commanders, First Sergeants and Supervisors will take all necessary steps to ensure the
  nominees are present to meet the board (i.e., members on leave in the local area, shift
  workers). Members not able to appear before the CBB must be excused by the 81
  TRW/CCC. The request must be coordinated through the respective Group Chief with the
  CCC. Members not able to appear before the CBB because of mission/duty related causes
  and has been excused by the 81 TRW/CCC, a records only board will be held. Nominees
  who do not have an excused absence will receive zero points. The board will be held prior to
  the 25th day of the board month (board months are March, June, September, and
  December) in order for selection updates to be processed.
  4.4. Individuals nominated will only be our very best performers and Airmen. They must be
  positive role models for others and clearly deserve the recognition. The unit commander will
  ensure that the nominee meets fitness standards and exemplifies the standards for appearance
  and conduct. Commanders & First Sergeants will screen out those with negative ―Quality
  Force‖ indicators. If the pool of eligibles doesn’t include Airmen of this caliber, the full BTZ
  quota will not be used by the convening authority.


  6.1. Selection folders include the BTZ report on individual personnel (RIP), AF Form 1206
  (attachment 2), and citations or orders for decorations.
  6.2. Max score 90 points and Line Requirements for AF Form 1206. Line requirements
  for each category: Leadership and Job Performance in primary duties (10 lines), Significant
  Self-Improvement (3 lines), and Base and Community Involvement (2 lines).

  7.1. Max score 10 Points. The primary purpose of the interview board is the professional
  development of assigned Airmen and to ensure appearance is commensurate with written
  performance. A physical appearance board will only be held if all nominees are able to
  attend. There are three areas that are evaluated during the interview: (1) Dress and
  Appearance (3 Pts), (2) Military Bearing (3 Pts) and (3) Communication Skills (4 Pts). Each
  board member will prepare two opinionated questions for the nominee and will only score
  the member based on the nominees answer to their question. The questions will be from the
  following 4 categories (1) Current Events, (2), Standards of conduct, (3) Dress and
  Appearance, and (4) Customs and Courtesies (attachment 5). Also, the member may be
  asked to recite the Airman’s Creed. All opinionated questions will be based on the AFPAM
  36-2241, Professional Development Guide, and current media such as local and base
  newspaper, Air Force Times, Airman Magazine, etc.

        8.1.2. DELETED
     9.1. Large unit nominees are arranged in an order of merit by total score and the quota is
     applied. Commanders will report selections to the MPS by underlining the name(s) on the
     BTZ eligibility list, providing board minutes with attachments (Attachment 8, Large Unit
     Minutes Memorandum) and returning them to 81 FSS/FSMPD NLT three duty days after the
     board has convened. The MPS will forward a copy of the minutes to the Wing CCC for
     review. Commanders are not required to select a nominee to fill the unit’s quota if he/she
     deems that the quality is not there. The squadron commander of large units will announce
     their selectees only after 81 TRW/CC has approved CBB selections.
     9.2. For the CBB, the board president sends a written report (Attachment 9, CBB Minutes
     Memorandum) to the convening authority with an order of merit list of all Airmen
     considered. The 81 TRW/CC may approve the board’s merit list (in whole or in part) or
     disapprove the promotion of an Airman whose record does not justify BTZ promotion. The
     81 TRW/CC may elect not to use the full quota.
        9.2.1. Once CBB results have been approved and signed, 81 FSS/FSMPD will provide a
        copy of the select list to group commanders and squadron commanders via email.
     9.3. The MPS will project promotions immediately upon receipt of confirmation of
     selections from the large unit commanders and the 81 TRW/CC for the CBB. This must be
     accomplished prior to the end of the board month.

10. Alternate Selection. Alternates may be selected in the event a selectee is removed or not
recommended for promotion before the promotion effective date. The MPS will review board
minutes to determine who the first alternate is and notify the commander of that individual. If
the commander recommends the alternate for promotion, he/she forwards a letter to the MPS for
the concurrence of 81 TRW/CC.
11. Supplemental Consideration. If an eligible Airman was not considered, and the error is
discovered before the promotions are announced, large unit commanders consider the Airman
and adjust selections accordingly. The CBB will be reconvened to consider small unit eligibles
and adjust selections accordingly. If the error is found after the promotions are announced, the
MPS will forward a request for supplemental consideration, by message, to HQ
AFPC/DPPPWM.
12. Adopted Form.
