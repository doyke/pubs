         SAMPLE SENSOR CHAPLAIN AWARD SUPERVISOR’S LETTER OF
                            CONCURRENCE

When completing the supervisor’s letter of concurrence, use the following example.

As the supervisor of this SENSOR Chaplain Award nominee, I attest that this nominee is not
now, nor has been in the past, engaged in any activities, which could adversely reflect upon the
Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Agency, the Air Force Chaplain Corps,
or the United States Air Force. Furthermore, this nominee has no negative quality indicators or
an unfavorable information file, which would preclude or complicate eligibility.

Finally, I will allow the nominee the time necessary to participate in the Air Force Intelligence
Surveillance Reconnaissance Agency’s annual award week activities and banquet in San
Antonio, Texas, ordinarily held during March. I fully support this nomination.
