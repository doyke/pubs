1. Role of Corporate Process Structure.
   1.1. The primary objective of the corporate process is to provide the AFMC Commander and
   Staff with the capability to review Command-wide issues from a corporate perspective and
   maximize the effectiveness of AFMC’s decision-making. The AFMC Corporate Process also
   facilitates the transition of resource decision-making from a functional requirements view to
   a corporate AFMC-framed, capabilities-focused process.
   1.1. (AFNWC) The primary objective of the Corporate Process is to provide the
   AFNWC/CC, Staff, and Mission Organizations with the capability to review Center-wide
   issues from a corporate perspective and maximize the effectiveness of AFNWC’s decision-
   making. The AFNWC Corporate Process also facilitates the transition of resource decision-
   making from a functional requirements view to a corporate AFNWC-framed, capabilities-
   focused process.
   1.2. The AFMC Corporate Process is not meant to replace existing Executive Steering
   Group or Functional Process Panels’ decision processes; rather it funnels these activities
   through the appropriate panel structure and Corporate Process. The objective of the
   Corporate Process is to provide a decision forum to address major cross-functional decisions
   requiring corporate review and discussion. For example, each panel should continue to make
   decisions affecting their specific resource panel or functional area, but if they want to
   recommend an action affecting the entire Command, they should take their proposal through
   the AFMC Corporate Process, starting with the AFMC Group.
   1.2. (AFNWC) The AFNWC Corporate Process is not meant to replace existing HQ AFMC
   Steering Group or Functional Process Panels’ decision processes. It is intended to allow
   corporate decisions for functional activities through a local Panel/Group/Council structure
   and Corporate Process and to provide a decision forum to address major cross-functional
   decisions requiring corporate review and discussion. Where AFMC corporate organizations
   are referenced in AFMCI 90-601, the AFNWC structure applies.
   1.3. Since the various panels are the bedrock of the overall process, they serve as the initial
   entry point (voice) for Centers, via their functional representatives, into the Command day-
   to-day business activities. AFMC/CC expects each panel chair to provide their full support
   and participation. HQ AFMC/A8/9 will designate a panel chair when a permanent panel
   chair is not available.
   1.3. (AFNWC) The various panels serve as the initial entry point (voice) for Directorates,
   SPOs and Mission Wings, via their functional representatives, into the Center day-to-day
   business activities. AFNWC/CC expects each panel chair to provide their full support and
   participation. AFNWC/XP will designate a panel chair when a permanent panel chair is not
   available.
   1.4. The Corporate Process ensures the supporting and dissenting opinions for all major
   decisions are captured to enable senior Command leadership to make informed decisions. It
   is not intended to supplant the functional staff but to enhance it. The staff continues to
   conduct its functional reviews before entering the Corporate Process. The AFMC Corporate
   Process will capitalize on the members' experience and knowledge of the Command to
   enable open discussions and improved decisions not possible in customary staffing actions.
   Members represent their particular functional areas, but are also required to take Command-

     wide, vice functional, perspectives in order to make corporate decisions. The strength of the
     AFMC Corporate Process is the consistency of reviews tied to successive staff levels. Full
     participation is expected of all AFMC Group and Council members.
     1.5. Figure 1 depicts the relationships between the various bodies in a hierarchical
     framework. AFMC Resource Management Panels are the bedrock of the process and are
     used by Mission Areas and HQ Functional Directors for management, resource and policy
     decisions within their respective areas. AFMC Resource Management Panel issues are
     vetted through the appropriate Enabling & Supporting Process Team prior to entering the
     Corporate Process at the AFMC Group level. The AFMC Group is the first level of the
     process taking a corporate view of the issue and as a decision-making body, will decide if the
     topic should be settled by the Group or forwarded to the AFMC Council, along with Group
     recommendation to the Council and any dissenting opinions from the Group members. A
     dissenting opinion can be any disagreement a member has with the AFMC Group
     recommendation. The AFMC Council is the senior decision-making body in the AFMC
     Corporate Process. AFMC/CC retains final decision authority for Corporate Process issues
     even if the Commander did not chair the meeting.
     1.5. (AFNWC) The AFNWC Corporate Structure is in Figure 1.

   1.6. Issues can also be downward directed by AFMC/CC, CV or CA to be presented to the
   AFMC Council. These issues need to be closely coordinated with HQ AFMC/A8/9,
   HQ AFMC/CS and HQ AFMC/CCX to ensure they are vetted through the AFMC Group
   prior to the AFMC Council. If HQ AFMC/A8/9, HQ AFMC/CS and HQ AFMC/CCX
   determine the issue is only informational and warrants an exception, the AFMC Group may
   be bypassed, and the issue will enter at the AFMC Council.
   1.6. (AFNWC) Issues can also be downward directed by AFNWC/CC, CA or CV to be
   presented to the AFNWC Council at their discretion. Issues requesting AFNWC Group
   involvement will need to be closely coordinated with AFNWC/XP, AFNWC/CS and
   AFNWC/CCX to ensure they are vetted through the AFNWC Group prior to the AFNWC
   Council. If AFNWC/XP, AFNWC/CS and AFNWC/CCX determine the issue is only
   informational and warrants an exception, the AFNWC Group may be bypassed, and the issue
   will enter at the AFNWC Council.
   1.7. The AFMC Council is composed of HQ Functional Directors and Center CCs and is
   chaired by AFMC/CC. AFMC/CV or AFMC/CA can chair in AFMC/CC’s absence. The

     AFMC Group is composed of HQ Directorate Deputies or O-6/GS-15 equivalent/Pay Band 3
     designees identified by the Director, Center XPs and is chaired by the HQ AFMC/A8/9
     Deputy or HQ AFMC/A8/9 designated Chair in their absence. Center participation is at the
     discretion of the chair for each level of the Corporate Process.
     1.7. (AFNWC) The AFNWC Council is composed of AFNWC Functional Directors, SPO
     Directors, and Wing/ CCs, and is chaired by AFNWC/CC. AFNWC/CA or AFNWC/CV can
     chair in AFNWC/CC’s absence. The AFNWC Group is composed of HQ Functional
     Directorate/ Deputies, SPO Directors, and Wing/ CCs or O-6/GS-15 equivalent designees
     identified by the Director/Commander, and chaired by AFNWC/XP. AFPEO/SS will be
     invited as a voting member if the Council or Group subject impacts weapon system
     acquisition, sustainment activities and for POM-related meetings.
     1.8. AFMC Centers are encouraged to mirror the AFMC Corporate Structure process and
     follow similar naming conventions to facilitate AFMC and Air Force alignment.
2. How the Corporate Process Works. Issues, recommendations or initiatives with resource
implications from AFMC steering groups, integrated process teams (IPTs), AFSO21, Balanced
Scorecard, etc., will be brought through the appropriate panel by the owner/sponsor of the
process. Enabling & Supporting Process Teams (other executive steering groups (ESGs), the
AFMC Civilian Employment Cost Management Committee (CECMC), the Support Services
Advisory Panel (SSAP), etc.) work through the panels to bring issues to the AFMC Group for
corporate action. The panel is responsible for ensuring that all internal AFMC coordination has
been accomplished prior to presentation to the AFMC Group. The Panel Chairperson is the
advocate for that package or decision to the Group.
2. (AFNWC)How the Corporate Process Works. Issues, recommendations or initiatives with
resource implications from AFNWC steering groups, integrated process teams (IPTs), AFSO21,
etc., will be brought forward through the appropriate panel by the owner/sponsor of the process.
Enabling & Supporting Process Teams, and the AFNWC Civilian Employment Cost
Management Committee (CECMC) work through the panels to bring issues to the AFNWC
Group for corporate action. The panel is responsible for ensuring that all internal AFNWC
coordination has been accomplished prior to presentation to the AFNWC Group. The Panel
Chairperson is the advocate for the package or decision to the Group.
     2.1. For major cross-cutting issues like the Program Objective Memorandum (POM), Initial
     Distribution, End-of-Year Distribution, Workyear Execution, Execution Plan, etc., the lead
     integrator will prepare the package to go to the Group.
     2.2. All resource allocation packages or decisions must flow through the AFMC Group prior
     to going to the Command Section. This includes all steering groups, committees, sub-IPTs,
     etc. The Group will make a recommendation forward which will be presented and discussed
     at the AFMC Council.
     2.2. (AFNWC) All resources allocation packages or decisions must flow through the
     AFNWC Group prior to going to the Command Section. This includes all steering groups,
     committees, sub-IPTs, etc. The Group will make a recommendation forward which will be
     presented and discussed at the AFNWC Council.

3. Corporate Process Structure Authority and Responsibilities.
   3.1. AFMC Resource Management Panels.
   3.1. (AFNWC) AFNWC Resource Management Panels.
      3.1.1. Responsibilities. The primary focus of the AFMC Panel structure is resource
      management/allocation. Panels provide integrated and coordinated recommendations on
      all programming, budgeting and execution activities and are responsible for allocation
      decisions for assigned Program Element Codes (PECs). Panels are involved with pay
      (manpower) and non-pay funding resource decisions throughout the entire Planning,
      Programming Budget Execution (PPBE) process. NOTE: AFMC Directorates are
      responsible for planning activities that do not require resource allocation decisions or
      Command approval, i.e., strategic planning and performance measurement. These
      planning efforts are developed and managed outside the panels to include other
      boards/steering groups.      For example, the recommendations from the Logistics
      Requirements Review Board or the Logistics Executive Steering Group would support
      the logistics planning function.
      3.1.1. (AFNWC) Responsibilities. The primary focus of the AFNWC Panel structure is
      resource management/allocation.          Panels provide integrated and coordinated
      recommendations on all programming, budgeting and execution activities and are
      responsible for allocation decisions for assigned Program Element Codes (PECs). Panels
      are involved with pay (manpower) and non-pay funding resource decisions throughout
      the entire Planning, Programming, Budget, and Execution (PPBE) process.
          3.1.1.1. (Added-AFNWC) The Panels will relate to the AFMC Nuclear Panel
          (AFMC/A10 led) as well as the AFMC functional panels.
      3.1.2. Designations. There are five panels supporting the AFMC mission. Each panel
      manages resources for an established set of PECs, except those that pertain to Centralized
      Asset Management (CAM/Operating Agency Code (OAC) 87). All OAC 87 resources

        relationship between the two advocating directorates. The chairperson establishes the
        organization of the internal staff, governs the degree of decision authority of the
        internal panel staff, and determines the level of resource allocation decisions made
        without convening a panel meeting.
        3.1.3.1. (AFNWC) Panel Chairperson is an 0-6/GS-15 equivalent internal to the

        3.1.3.2. Panel Secretariat is determined by the Panel Chairperson. The secretariat is
        responsible for maintaining panel membership, scheduling meetings, preparing
        agendas and read-ahead information, submitting prep packages, ensuring minutes are
        taken, reviewing minutes, tracking action items, identifying AFMC Group topics to
        the AFMC Group Secretariat, and communicating applicable panel activity to the
        Group.
        3.1.3.2. (AFNWC) Panel Secretariat is determined by the Panel Chairperson. The
        secretariat is responsible for maintaining panel membership, scheduling meetings,
        preparing agendas and read-ahead information, submitting prep packages, ensuring
        minutes are taken, reviewing minutes, tracking action items, identifying AFNWC
        Group topics to the AFNWC Group Secretariat, and communicating applicable panel
        activity to the Group.
        3.1.3.3. Most Panel Members are subject matter experts external to the directorate(s)
        advocating resources for the applicable programs, intended to mitigate stove-pipe
        thinking and facilitate increased communication and collaboration. Cross-cutting
        organizations, i.e., HQ AFMC/A1, A6/7, A8/9, EN, FM, and SE are members of all
        panels. Decisions are made through consensus from all panel members. Panel
        recommendations proceeding to the AFMC Group and Council must be approved by
        the affected director(s) or deputy director(s).
        3.1.3.3. (AFNWC) Most Panel Members are subject matter experts external to the
        directorate(s) advocating resources for the applicable programs, intended to mitigate
        stove-pipe thinking and facilitate increased communication and collaboration. Cross-
        cutting organizations, i.e., AFNWC/XP, DP, FM, CS, and EN are members of all
        panels. Decisions are made through consensus from all panel members. Panel
        recommendations proceeding to the AFNWC Group and Council must be approved
        by the affected director(s) or suitable representative.
        3.1.3.4. Internal Panel Staff are subject matter experts and typically include the Panel
        Secretariat. Internal staff may or may not be panel members. Internal panel staffs are
        involved with day-to-day functions of resource management and are accountable to
        the panel chairperson.
     3.1.4. De-confliction. In those cases where a resource decision by a panel chairperson
     could benefit the chairperson’s directorate at the expense of another directorate, the Panel
     Chairperson is advised to present even minor issues to the panel for approval. Due to the
     sensitive nature of such a decision, only the smallest of such resource decisions should be
     made without panel approval. Only decisions made by vetting through the panel can be
     presented to the Group or Council as a ―Panel Approved Position.‖ Should a dissenting
     opinion result from the panel meeting, the first step to resolving such a situation is to
     present it to the affected directors or deputy directors at the same time for approval.
     Should they approve the recommendation, proceeding to the AFMC Group is not
     necessary. If it is a major resource decision, the AFMC Corporate Structure should be
     employed, starting with the AFMC Group.
     3.1.5. Center Point of Contact (POC). For contact purposes, Centers are required to
     provide a POC for questions related to funding association. A single POC may work
     more than one PEC. For example, one person could be responsible for PEC 88744
AFMCI90-601_AFNWCSUP_I 13 JUNE 2011                                                           13


     (Family Housing – Leasing), PEC 88745 (Family Housing – Operations) and PEC 88746
     (Family Housing – Maintenance). It is important the subject matter experts at Center
     level are linked with their counterparts in the headquarters.
  3.2. AFMC Group.
  3.2. (AFNWC) AFNWC Group.
     3.2.1. Responsibilities. The AFMC Group functions as a forum to vet and integrate
     issues for the AFMC Council and if appropriate, serves as the decision-making authority.
     The AFMC Group vets major issues requiring a corporate decision such as issues cutting
     across mission or functional areas. Corporate issues typically are generated through
     Resource Management Panels or Process Panels, but before a topic is briefed to the
     AFMC Group, it must be sponsored by a headquarters 2-Ltr directorate through the
     appropriate panel. The Group considers all inputs from mission areas and functional
     managers when developing options. The AFMC Group is a decision-making body and
     will decide if the topic should be forwarded to the Council. If any member has a
     dissenting opinion, it is recorded in the minutes and forwarded to the Council.
     3.2.1. (AFNWC) Responsibilities. The AFNWC Group functions as a forum to vet and
     integrate issues for the AFNWC Council and if appropriate, serves as the decision-
     making authority.       Corporate issues typically are generated through Resource
     Management Panels or Process Panels, but before a topic is briefed to the AFNWC
     Group, it must be sponsored by a 2-Ltr directorate, Wing, or System Program Office
     (SPO) through the appropriate panel. The AFNWC Group will decide if the topic is
     forwarded to the Council and if any member has a dissenting opinion, it is recorded in the
     minutes and forwarded to the Council.
        3.2.1.1. (Added-AFNWC) If another Center will be impacted by an AFNWC
        decision, AFNWC/XP will notify the other Center and establish a separate meeting or
        invite the other Center to attend the AFNWC Group meeting.
     3.2.2. Membership.
        3.2.2.1. The AFMC Group is chaired by the HQ AFMC/A8/9 Deputy or HQ
        AFMC/A8/9 designee in his/her absence (see Figure 2). The other members of the
        AFMC Group are the HQ Directorate Deputies or O-6/GS-15 equivalent Pay Band 3
        designees identified by the Director (HQ AFMC/A1, A2/5, A3, A4, A6/7, A8/9, CS,
        EN, FM, HC, HO, IG, JA, PA, PK, SE, and SG), Center XPs, Guard Advisor (CG)
        and the Reserve Advisor (CR). The AFMC Group will normally include the Center
        XPs or may convene without their representation as determined by the AFMC Group
        Chair. If Centers are not required to participate, it is imperative that the HQ Directors
        (topic OPRs) be prepared to discuss potential Center impacts. It is HQ AFMC/A8X’s
        responsibility to notify all Center XPs of the Group agenda so they also have the
        opportunity to notify the appropriate contacts at the Centers.
        3.2.2.1. (AFNWC) The AFNWC Group will be chaired by AFNWC/XP and is
        depicted in Figure 2. If an AFNWC Panel does not exist for a proposed briefing
        topic, AFNWC/XP will be notified of a required decision and schedule an AFNWC
        Group meeting, or direct the subject to an existing panel.

     scheduling meetings, preparing agendas, submitting prep packages, reviewing minutes,
     tracking action items, and communicating AFMC Group activity. A POC Checklist is
     located under ―Meeting Documents‖ on the AFMC Corporate Process Community of
     Practice                   (CoP)                      website               homepage:
     https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/openCoP.asp?Filter=OO-XP-MC-CP.                Issue
     OPRs, typically panel secretariats, will submit a potential Group topic to HQ
     AFMC/A8X at least one week in advance of meeting using the ―meeting request form‖
     link also provided on the website homepage. The secretariat will ensure the topic is
     ready to present to the AFMC Group. Additionally, the Group Secretariat will determine
     the schedule of topics based on their relative priority. If an emergency meeting is
     needed, HQ AFMC/A8X will schedule an out-of-cycle Group meeting to meet the need
     of the Issue OPR. The secretariat will post upcoming meetings on the AFMC Corporate
     Process CoP Website. Read-aheads are due to the secretariat two days prior, usually on
     Tuesday by close of business. The Group Secretariat will post the read-aheads on the
     CoP and send an e-mail to Group members providing a link directly to the read-aheads.
     It is the Group members’ responsibility to retrieve the briefing charts.
     3.2.3. (AFNWC) Administrative. AFNWC/XP will assign a Group Secretariat (XP) and

     recommendations before proceeding to the AFMC Council. The HQ AFMC/A8/9 Chair
     retains final decision authority for all issues brought to the AFMC Group for resolution
     and for all recommendations forwarded to the AFMC Council. When a consensus cannot
     be reached, the HQ AFMC/A8/9 Chair ensures dissenting opinions are voiced and
     documented. Any member may forward a dissenting position to the HQ AFMC/A8/9
     Chair, in writing, within 24 hours of the decision. Dissenting views must be presented
     through the dissenter’s functional representative at the next higher level. All attendees
     are subject to approval by the HQ AFMC/A8/9 Chair. After topics are approved by the
     AFMC Group, the Issue OPR will add a chart titled ―Group Recommendation‖ to signify
     to the Council that all issues have been fully vetted. Topics presented for information

     on a weekly basis. The Chair of the AFMC Group may recommend to AFMC/CC to
     convene a special meeting of the AFMC Council to address specific corporate issues.
     Decision briefings presented at the semiannual AFMC Senior Leader Conferences are
     also considered AFMC Council meetings.
     3.3.5. (AFNWC) Frequency. The AFNWC Council convenes at the direction of
     AFNWC/CC. The Chair of the AFNWC Group may recommend to AFNWC/CC to
     convene a special meeting of the AFNWC Council to address specific corporate issues. If
     no topics are identified, AFNWC/CCX will notify all members of meeting cancellation at
     least one day prior to the scheduled meeting. NOTE: Typically, a set schedule will be
     established to address standing issues (for example: 1st week of the month – Financial,
     2nd week of the month – Personnel, 3rd week of the month – Facility, 4th week of the
     month – special topics).

      3.3.6. Location. Unless otherwise announced by the facilitator, AFMC Council meetings
      will be held via VTC Monday, 0930-1130 ET, following Commander’s Staff Meeting in
      the Situation Room, Building 262, WPAFB.
      3.3.7. Presentations. Topics for the AFMC Council will be coordinated with HQ
      AFMC/CCX and HQ AFMC/A8X and approved by the AFMC Council Chair. The
      facilitator will distribute the approved agenda topics to the Council members. Guidelines
      and templates for briefings are available on the CoP. For presentations, the OPR will
      provide a synopsis of the briefing (Event Brief) to include: subject, issue, views of others,
      staff view and recommended action for AFMC/CC/CV/CA (see Attachment 1). AFMC
      Council briefer will provide briefing copies and cue sheets to the Council Secretariat by
      1200 on Tuesday prior to the scheduled Council. The Council Secretariat will make
      distribution to members in sufficient time to allow two working days for review prior to
      the meeting.       Corporate Process topics that have met the AFMC Group and are
      forwarded to the next level will be scheduled to be heard by the AFMC Council no
      sooner than the second Monday following Group presentation. Exceptions are those
      topics that are time-sensitive and are approved by the Group Chair for presentation at the
      Council on the Monday directly following presentation at the Group.
      3.3.8. Electronic Announcements. Initial notification of meetings, agendas, briefings
      and other AFMC Council communication activity will be distributed using the most
      appropriate means (typically e-mail). Copies of briefings, event briefs and minutes will
      be posted on the CoP unless deemed sensitive, FOUO or internal to the HQ.
      3.3.9. E-Council.
         3.3.9.1. An e-Council is an alternative to a ―sit-down‖ Council meeting. It is
         designed to address issues ready for approval while saving senior leadership’s time in
         meetings. An e-Council meeting should be used only for routine, non-controversial
         issues brought forward from the Group. The Issue OPR will prepare an e-SSS for
         AFMC/CV or CA signature to all the Council members for approval of a proposed
         routine, non-controversial issue using voting buttons. The e-SSS gives CV/CA the
         opportunity to review the issue and either approve release for coordination or remand
         to the AFMC Group for more discussion, etc. Once CV/CA has signed the e-SSS,
         HQ AFMC/CCX will send it out for coordination and electronic voting. AFMC
         Council members approve the proposed topic using the voting buttons which returns
         their vote to HQ AFMC/CCX. CCX will tabulate the results and provide to
         AFMC/CC including any comments received during coordination.
         3.3.9.2. If any member of the Council has specific issues that can’t be resolved in the
         electronic coordination, then a regular Council meeting will be scheduled to address
         the issue. An example of an e-Council can be found by accessing the following
         website                                                                           link:
