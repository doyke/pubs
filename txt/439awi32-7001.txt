This instruction provides procedures for coordinating among Munitions Flight (439
MXS/MXMW), Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD, 439 CES/CED), and Environmental office
(439 MSG/CEV) personnel to resolve any munitions-related environmental concerns at the
lowest level. This procedure is intended to fulfill the need for advanced procedures with
appropriate environmental regulatory agencies that enable EOD personnel to quickly and
effectively respond to situations involving munitions, as specified in Air Force Instruction (AFI)
21-201 paragraphs 3.12.4.5.4 and 3.12.4.6. This procedure is a 439th Airlift Wing Instruction
(AWI) supplementing AFI 32-7001, Environmental Management, as it addresses the
environmental management component of munitions responses for Westover Air Reserve Base
(ARB).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Introduction and Responsibilities sections were added. References were updated to reflect
current munitions and EOD instructions. The “Determination of Solid Waste Status” section was
deleted, and AFI 21-201 procedures were referenced to explain the Ammunition Disposition
Request process for determining disposition of munitions items that Munitions manages.
Massachusetts regulations were added.
1. Introduction. The purpose of this instruction is to assure that a partnership is established
between the Environmental office, Staff Judge Advocate (SJA, 439 AW/SJA), EOD, and
Munitions to plan for and resolve any munitions-related environmental concerns at the lowest
 2                                                          439AWI32-7001 9 AUGUST 2013


level and ensure appropriate regulatory agency coordination, when required. AFI 32-201,
Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management, and AFI 32-3001, Explosive Ordnance
Disposal (EOD) Program, outline Munitions and EOD personnel responsibilities, respectively,
related to response to incidents involving munitions. These requirements are outside the scope of
AWI 32-7001. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the state of Massachusetts, the U. S.
Department of Defense (DoD), and the U. S. Air Force (Air Force) establish criteria for
managing munitions that are discovered, including munitions discovered outside the normal
military munitions management process. Because Massachusetts does not adopt the Federal
Military Munitions Rule, the Code of Massachusetts Regulations (CMR) requirements for
emergency response to munitions must also be considered. These regulations specify
requirements for coordination with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection
(DEP). 310 CMR 40.000 establishes requirements for emergency response in Massachusetts.
310 CMR 40.0317(5) exempts releases of forbidden and Class A or Class B explosives from
emergency response notification requirements if the explosives are under military transport or
supervision and U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance personnel respond to the release. DEP clarified
in email coordinated through the Emergency Response Program Section Chief that U.S. Army
Explosive Ordnance personnel include EOD personnel of all branches of DoD, including the Air
Force. Although not required, Westover ARB will notify DEP, as a courtesy, when emergency
responses require transport off-base or management at the Fort Devens range. Additionally,
Massachusetts hazardous waste regulation at 310 CMR 30.104(2)(r) exempts certain explosive
emergency responses from hazardous waste regulations and states: “Explosives which are
destroyed by, or whose destruction is supervised, by U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance personnel,
if such explosives are generated by a Small Quantity Generator, as that term is defined in 310
CMR 30.351(1) and (2), such destruction does not involve land disposal, and such destruction
occurs during an immediate response to an immediate threat to human health, safety or welfare
or to the environment, by U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance personnel.” The DEP Hazardous
Waste Division also views “U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance” personnel to include the Air Force.
Additionally, the DEP Emergency Response Program Section Chief confirmed via email that it is
the intent for any military unit performing a public safety emergency procedure to be covered by
these exemptions (i.e., the exemption from hazardous substance release notification and the
exemption from hazardous waste regulations).
2. Responsibilities. Section 2 outlines responsibilities of key Westover ARB organizations in
managing potentially unsafe munitions.
     2.1. EOD
       2.1.1. EOD evaluates hazards of potentially unsafe munitions and determines the
       appropriate response to minimize their hazards. A Level 1 response is one in which the
       EOD response specialist determines that the munitions require an immediate response
       (e.g., not safe to transport or store). A Level 2 response is one in which the EOD
       response specialist determines that the munitions item is an imminent and substantial
       endangerment but can be transported and temporarily stored pending destruction.
       2.1.2. For Level 1 and Level 2 responses, EOD destroys unsafe explosive ordnance
       according to local, state, and Federal requirements for emergency response to the
       explosive hazard.   All off-installation emergency EOD responses are conducted in
       accordance with (IAW) AFI 32-3001, paragraph 7.3. The request for assistance from
439AWI32-7001 9 AUGUST 2013                                                                    3


      civil authorities IAW paragraph 7.3.1 should be provided to Westover in writing to
      ensure documented compliance with AFI 32-3001, paragraph 7.3.1.
      2.1.3. The EOD Flight shall document their response expenses for actions potentially
      reimbursable under AFI 32-3001, paragraph 7.3.2.2.1.3. The EOD Flight evaluates
      hazards of potentially unsafe munitions and determines the appropriate response to
      minimize their hazard. A Level 1 response is one in which the EOD response specialist
      determines that the munitions require an immediate response (e.g., not safe to transport or
      store). A Level 2 response is one in which the EOD response specialist determines that
      the munitions item is an imminent and substantial endangerment but can be transported
      and temporarily stored pending state notification.
      2.1.4. The EOD Flight shall not transport ordnance from an off-installation site onto the
      installation until such time as the installation SJA has determined that: (1) doing so will
      not violate the prohibitions set forth in 10 United States Code § 2692 IAW AFI 32-3001,
      paragraph 31.4.2.2.1; and (2) doing so will not violate any Hazardous Materials
      Transportation Act or hazardous waste permitting, placarding, or manifesting
      requirements IAW AFI 32-3001, paragraph 3.1.5. EOD can contact the SJA via the
      command post if after duty hours.
   2.2. Munitions. For DoD stock-listed conventional munitions, Munitions is responsible for
   processing Ammunition Disposition Requests IAW Air Force requirements to determine
   proper disposition of the item. These items are outside the scope of this procedure because
   the DoD Designated Disposition Authority determines disposition of these items, which may
   include transferring the item for use elsewhere.
   2.3. Environmental Office.     The Environmental office is responsible for providing
   regulatory guidance and regulatory interface, if needed, based on DEP recommendations.
   Environmental also coordinates with DEP, as a courtesy, for EOD munitions responses
   involving transport off-base.
   2.4. SJA (439 AW/SJA or 951 RSPTS OL-E/SJA). SJA is responsible for participating in
   planning to resolve any munitions-related environmental concerns and developing a
   memorandum of agreement with DEP, if considered to be beneficial. SJA reviews and
   provides recommendations for planned actions to coordinate with DEP.
3. Management of Response to Munitions. Section 3 provides procedures for Level 1 and
Level 2 responses.
   3.1. When suspect munitions are discovered, they must be reported to the Command Post in
   order to activate appropriate response actions, including mobilizing EOD to respond.
   Munitions, the Environmental office, and/or SJA could also be called on to provide their
   respective expertise.
   3.2. EOD will investigate, determine if the situation threatens the safety of personnel or
   property, and determine the response level, if response is required.
   3.3. For both Level 1 and Level 2 responses, either EOD or the Command Post will
   coordinate with the Environmental office. Environmental personnel will coordinate with
   SJA, if necessary, for the particular response and determine whether a courtesy call to DEP is
   appropriate.
 4                                                           439AWI32-7001 9 AUGUST 2013


     3.4. EOD will follow DoD and Air Force EOD requirements to address the munitions
     response.
     3.5. The Environmental office or the Command Post, if Environmental is unavailable, will
     notify the state regional environmental regulatory authority, DEP Western Region at (413)
     755-2231, of the planned detonation, if a courtesy call is appropriate based on the nature of
     the response.
     3.6. Trained and authorized EOD personnel will destroy the item and maintain a standard
     EOD After Action Report of the event for 3 years.
4. Legal and Regulatory Review and Concurrence. Section 4 describes responsibilities for
achieving compliance with regulatory requirements.
     4.1. Environmental Office Actions:
        4.1.1. The Environmental office will coordinate with SJA, when appropriate, for review
        and recommendations regarding the response action EOD has determined for a
        munitions-related incident. The SJA can be reached via the command post after hours.
        4.1.2. After SJA review and receipt of their recommendations, the Environmental office
        will ensure all regulatory-required documentation is maintained.
     4.2. SJA Actions:
        4.2.1. SJA will review planned actions and make recommendations, as needed, regarding
        Level 1 and Level 2 responses.
        4.2.2. If SJA deems necessary, Environmental personnel will arrange a meeting with
        appropriate Air Force and DEP officials to discuss the details of munitions-related
        responses and obtain DEP concurrence with the response action.
     4.3. 439th Airlift Wing Command Post Actions:
        4.3.1. If the Environmental office and SJA are unavailable to provide coordination with
        DEP, the Command Post will implement and document the verbal notification to DEP
        outlined in Section 3.5.
5. Execution of Level 1 and Level 2 Responses. Section 5 outlines requirements for Level 1
and Level 2 responses.
     5.1. If the munitions are associated with a Level 1 or Level 2 response and are destroyed at
     Westover ARB, appropriately trained and authorized EOD personnel will perform the
     destruction. The Environmental office will maintain a log, memorandum, or other
     appropriate documentation of DEP notifications and SJA coordination regarding Level 1 and
     Level 2 responses, as applicable.
     5.2. Munitions, the Environmental office, and EOD components will jointly ensure that any
     special requirements established by DEP through the concurrence process are accomplished.
