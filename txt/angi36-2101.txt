                     ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS AND PROGRAMS

2.1. Introduction.
   2.1.1. The primary purpose of the ANG assignment system is to assign ANG members to
   enhance unit effectiveness and meet the personnel resource needs of each ANG unit while
   maintaining a healthy force structure and ensuring fiduciary responsibility.
   2.1.2. The objective of the ANG assignments system is to attain and maintain at least 100
   percent manning of all Unit Manpower Document (UMD) positions. To achieve 100 percent
   objective, assignment in excess status is authorized for trainees in the student flight in
   accordance with (IAW) Paragraph 2.16., and for selected Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs)
   IAW Paragraph 2.2.4. to be manned above a 100 percent level.
   2.1.3. ANG assignments will be made for all members without regard to color, race, religion
   (except chaplains), ethnic background, national origin, or gender (except where prohibited by
   law IAW Paragraph 2.15.), consistent with requirements for physical capabilities.
   Assignments will be based solely on the abilities of individuals to perform productively in
   the jobs for which they are being considered.
   2.1.4. Retraining of personnel may be needed to minimize the number of excess and
   overgrade conditions.
       2.1.4.1. Assignments must not occur unless they are part of a comprehensive personnel
       force management plan.
       2.1.4.2. All assignments of officers and enlisted personnel, Master Sergeants and above,
       will be monitored by The State Headquarters.
   2.1.5. When the term ―State‖ or ―States‖ is addressed, this term includes all 50 states and
   territories; Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the District of Columbia.
2.2. General Instruction.
   2.2.1. Following appointment or enlistment in the ANG, initial assignments will be made
   IAW guidance provided in this instruction. All assignments within the ANG will be
   consistent with the classification instruction and procedures contained in AFI 36-2101,
   Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted) and consistent with enlistment,
   appointment, promotion, demotion, retention, and separation procedures outlined in
   applicable United States Air Force (USAF) and ANG directives. Members must meet at
   least the entry-level qualification criteria or be granted the appropriate waiver prior to career
   field assignment as specified in the Air Force Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD), and
   the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD), before assignment to a UMD
   position.
   2.2.2. Unit commanders will select personnel for assignment to authorized UMD positions
   consistent with individual’s AFSC, skill level, and grade to meet the unit’s Unit Tasking
   Code (UTC) requirements. Each unit will provide assignment change data to its servicing
   FSS, which will establish procedures to ensure it is entered into the personnel data system.
   The FSS will review unit assignment data change requests to ensure that ANG policies are
 6                                                              ANGI36-2101 10 APRIL 2012


     being met. Under no circumstances will the FSS update information in the Personnel Data
     System (PDS) that is not in compliance with this instruction. Unit commanders and the FSS
     must take appropriate action to meet the intent of this instruction and ensure the ANG is a
     viable resource for mobilization.
        2.2.2.1. Commanders and the FSS must work together to fill all UMD positions, either
        through reassignment or through recruiting.
        2.2.2.2. Airmen must be assigned to authorized UMD positions based on the Resource
        Identifier Code (RIC) IAW Attachment 4. If the unit needs to move the RIC between
        two UMD positions a Manpower Change Request (MCR) must be requested through
        NGB/A1M. In addition, the MPS/HRO will ensure the member’s Tech-ID and Active
        Duty Codes (ACDU) are updated correctly in the Personnel Data System (PDS) any time
        their status changes.
     2.2.3. Assignments of UMD vacancies must be made in conjunction with state and unit
     personnel force management plans.
     2.2.4. Exceptions to the objective of maintaining manning at 100 percent of UMD
     authorizations, and ANGI 36-2005, Appointment of Officers in the Air National Guard of the
     United States and as Reserves of the Air Force, and ANGI 36-2002, Enlistment and
     Reenlistment in the Air National Guard and as a Reserve of the Air Force, are permitted as
     follows:
        2.2.4.1. Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT). Individuals may be recruited to fill UFT
        training line numbers. A rated vacancy must exist at the time a member is reassigned
        from the student flight. Multiple rated members cannot be assigned to one UMD position
        and share allotted flying hours.
        2.2.4.2. Individuals recruited against AFSCs 41XX, 44XX, 45XX, or 48XX
        authorizations under the Early Commissioning Program for Physicians IAW Paragraph
        2.12.
        2.2.4.3. NGB/A1 will announce selected AFSCs that units may fill to higher levels based
        upon service needs. Announcements will be made each Fiscal Year (FY) through the
        Recruiting and Retention Initiatives. Changes to the initiatives may be made by NGB/A1
        at any time based on the needs of the ANG. Excess expiration dates will be IAW Table
        4.1.
            2.2.4.3.1. States will not exceed the grade manning levels for enlisted personnel as
            outlined in Attachment 3.
2.3. Assignment of Full-Time Personnel. Assign military technician and AGR personnel the
incumbent to a military UMD position compatible with their full-time duties and responsibilities.
Care must be exercised to ensure unit and AFSC compatibility is not violated when
reassignments are made. Assignment of individuals in AGR status will be made IAW ANGI 36-
101, The Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) Program, and this instruction. ANGI 36-101 will take
precedence where conflict exists.
     2.3.1. Only under mission unique situations and in the best interest of the ANG will
     NGB/A1 authorize military technicians or AGR personnel to be assigned in an excess status.
     An excess assignment request will be submitted IAW Paragraph 4.2.9.1. of this instruction.
ANGI36-2101 10 APRIL 2012                                                                          7


   2.3.2. First Sergeants. Emphasis should be placed on the selection of a Drill Status
   Guardsman (DSG). Effective 1 January 2012 AGRs are not authorized assignment against a
   First Sergeant position unless there is a valid full time requirement for a First Sergeant on the
   manning document. There will be no AGRs (RIC 148, AGR) assigned against the First
   Sergeant (RIC 128, DSG). For those AGR members who are assigned against the First
   Sergeant RIC 128 prior to 1 January 2012, once they vacate the position, it will no longer be
   filled by an AGR. Military Technicians may be assigned to the First Sergeant position only
   once in their career, and this term will be no less than three years from date of assignment
   and no more than six years from date of graduation from the USAF First Sergeants Academy,
   AFI 36-2113, The First Sergeant, Chapter 7. If a technician is selected, TAG must approve a
   local exception to the compatibility criteria, ensuring ANG First Sergeant Functional
   Manager coordination.
       2.3.2.1. Waivers to leave the position prior to three years from date of assignment must
       be processed through the ANG First Sergeant Functional manager. Waivers to extend the
       maximum term will not be considered.
       2.3.2.2. Upon completion of their assignment, military technicians and those AGRs who
       were previously authorized assignment must be reassigned to a UMD position with a
       compatible AFSC that will support the individual's current grade. Commanders must
       exercise sound force management practices to ensure reassignment complies with this
       provision. Only in unique mission essential situations and in the best interest of the
       ANG, where this requirement cannot be met, the member's Command Chief Master
       Sergeant may request an overgrade waiver to support the current grade. All requests
       must include complete justification and a favorable TAG endorsement. NGB/A1P and
       the ANG First Sergeant Functional Manager retain approval authority. Overgrade status
       will not exceed 24 months from date of assignment or ETS, whichever is earlier.
   2.3.3. State/Wing CCM. Emphasis should be placed on the selection of a DSG. However,
   TAG may approve a local exception to the compatibility criteria to allow a full-time person
   to serve as a CCM. The following conditions apply:
       2.3.3.1. Prior to assignment as a CCM, military technician and AGR personnel must
       serve at least 12 months in a specialty that is compatible with their full-time UMD
       position (i.e., immediately prior to appointment as a CCM). This condition is not
       waiverable.
2.4. Assignment of Family Members. Family members must be separated by at least two
levels of supervision within their unit [as defined by their Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS)].
This condition is not waiverable. Commanders are within the first level of supervision for all
members within their respective unit. CCMs and first sergeants are within the first level of
supervision for all enlisted members within their respective unit. This does not preclude family
members from being assigned within a subordinate organization. For example: a state CCM
with a family member assigned within the state is acceptable because it meets the rule for two
levels of supervision between them. A first sergeant at the group level must also meet the
requirement of two levels of supervision between them. Assignment of family members must
meet the following criteria:
   2.4.1. Prior to the assignment, the unit commander must conclude there exists neither a
   potential conflict of interest nor the possibility of preferential treatment on the part of either
 8                                                                  ANGI36-2101 10 APRIL 2012


     family member. Care must be given to watch for perceptions of preferential treatment or loss
     of impartiality, thereby compromising the integrity of the command and supervisory
     functions.
     2.4.2. One family member cannot be in the other's rating chain as first or second level
     rater/reviewer. Reference AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems, when
     establishing rater/reviewer.
2.5. Assignment of Members with Physical Limitations. Worldwide Air Force commitments
call for each member serving in active status to be physically qualified for immediate global
deployment. This includes all locations without regard to climate, physical ailments, need for
special diet or medications, or available medical treatment. A member with physical limitations
is identified and promptly referred to a medical facility for evaluation as shown in AFI 36-3212,
Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, and Separation, and AFI 48-123, Medical
Examinations and Standards.
     2.5.1. Temporary Medical Deferment. A member may be temporarily deferred from
     worldwide assignment availability when accepted medical principles make it known that a
     physical defect that prevents worldwide service is temporary and should be resolved within
     12 months. The medical facility sends the FSS notification of a temporary medical
     deferment on an AF 422, Physical Profile Serial Report. When the AF 422 shows a ―4T‖ in
     the "revised" line of Section II of the form, the FSS enters the appropriate DEPLOYMENT
     STATUS PHYS code in the current personnel data system with an availability date equal to
     the expiration date shown on the AF 422. Reference AFPAM 48-133, Physical Examination
     Techniques, for detailed instructions on completing AF 422. Thirty calendar days before the
     deployment availability expiration date, the FSS verifies the date of availability with the
     medical facility. The availability date is extended or canceled based on a new AF 422.
     Temporary deferments must not extend beyond 12 months from the date when the underlying
     defect was deemed, or clearly should have been deemed disqualifying for worldwide duty.
     Assignment instruction for pregnant personnel is outlined in ANGI 40-104, Pregnancy of Air
     National Guard Personnel.
     2.5.2. Movement of ANG Personnel. Air transportation is the primary mode of travel for the
     movement of all ANG military personnel. Inability of a member to accept air transportation
     as the primary mode of travel is incompatible with an ANG career. Promptly refer all
     members who cannot travel by air to a medical facility for evaluation by a medical board
     under AFI 48-123. If a restriction on air travel is due to physical disability as shown in AFI
     48-123, referral to a Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) is mandatory. If restriction on air
     travel is the result of any reason other than physical disability, the medical board takes action
     shown in AFI 48-123 and forwards the case for proper administrative action.
2.6. Assignment of Former Members of the Peace Corps:
     2.6.1. Former members of the Peace Corps are not assigned duty in the intelligence field for
     a period of four years following termination of membership. Airmen are not assigned in an
     intelligence capacity to any foreign country in which they previously served as Peace Corps
     members. There are no waivers or exceptions to this instruction due to overriding national
     interests.
ANGI36-2101 10 APRIL 2012                                                                        9


   2.6.2. The term "former members of the Peace Corps" includes former Peace Corps
   volunteers, volunteer leaders, and staff members of the Peace Corps. The term does not
   include persons who attended Peace Corps training, but never went overseas with the Peace
   Corps. Persons who attended training only are restricted from being assigned duties in an
   intelligence capacity only to foreign countries for which trained to serve in the Peace Corps.
2.7. Personnel in Retraining Status. Personnel in retraining status as a result of voluntary
action, realignment, reorganization, UMD change, or to meet ANG needs will be assigned to a
projected UMD vacancy or UMD growth position. Every effort will be made to ensure that
assignment to a position for retraining does not result in an overgrade situation.
   2.7.1. If the retraining status is a result of an enlisted member's voluntary action, and the
   position is not commensurate with the member’s current grade, a demotion will be initiated
   to be effective with the date of transfer as outlined in ANGI 36-2503, Administrative
   Demotion of Airmen.
   2.7.2. Personnel in retraining status who become overgrade as a result of an NGB directed
   unit realignment, reorganization, or UMD change may be retained in grade only under the
   provisions outlined in Chapter 4.
2.8. State Headquarters Assignments:
   2.8.1. Officers being considered for appointment to positions of Adjutant General (AG) or
   assistant AG must be appointed IAW ANGI 36-2501, Federal Recognition of General
   Officer Appointment and Promotion in the Air National Guard of the United States and as a
   Reserve of the Air Force, or ANGI 36-2005, as appropriate. All other assignment actions
   will be IAW this instruction.
   2.8.2. NGB, Human Resources (NGB/HR) will maintain and provide to each state annually
   or as requested an active duty listing for members on an ANG Statutory Tour (includes NGB
   and its operating locations), and United States Property and Fiscal Officers. TAGs should
   maintain regular contact with these individuals while they are on active duty to determine if
   they plan to return to the state ANG at the end of their active duty tours. TAGs should
   include ANG Statutory Tour members in the state force management plans.
2.9. Air Force Reserve Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs) and Category “E”
Reservists: AF Reserve (AFRES) IMAs and category ―E‖ reservists may be attached to ANG
units for training with the approval of TAG. Such attachment does not require these individuals
to be reported in the unit's strength. When such individuals are attached, the provisions of
AFMAN 36-8001, Reserve Personnel Participation and Training Procedures, must be followed.
2.10. General Officer Assignments or Colonels Assigned to General Officer Positions:
   2.10.1. The NGB-General Officer Actions (NGB-GO) is the office of primary responsibility
   for all general officer actions.
   2.10.2. The high visibility of senior officer personnel management caused by frequent
   congressional review requires close monitoring by NGB-GO and each AG. The
   reassignment of a federally recognized general officer, or colonel, or the assignment of any
   officer, regardless of grade, to a general officer position, should not be finalized until prior
   coordination with NGB-GO is completed and TAG reviews and approves the action.
 10                                                               ANGI36-2101 10 APRIL 2012


   2.10.3. General officer personnel reassignments will not take place to positions, which have
   a grade authorization below that of the member. An officer in Adjutant General Corps
   (AGC) position must be re-appointed under ANGI 36-2501 before they can be assigned to a
   line position. NGB-GO will review the assignment status of general officers and colonels to
   general officer positions. An officer who vacates a tenure of office position to revert to a line
   position will be appointed at the highest grade previously held as a line officer.
   2.10.4. Prerequisites and procedures for Federal recognition in general officer grades are set
   forth in ANGI 36-2501.
   2.10.5. The ANG Special Assistant Program, managed by NGB-GO, includes positions
   graded colonel and above. The program includes ANG officers selected to represent the
   ANG at Major Command (MAJCOM) and Air Staff levels and ANG officers selected to
   represent all Reserve Components at Combatant Command and Joint Staff levels.
   2.10.6. General officers may only be assigned to flying positions authorized by the Chief of
   Staff of the Air Force.
2.11. Assignment of Rated Personnel. UMD positions that require the incumbent to possess
an aeronautical rating are identified by an Aircrew Position Indicator (API) other than "0." All
officers assigned to rated positions must hold the aeronautical rating required for the position to
which assigned IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
2.12. Assignment of Additional Physicians. The following instructions apply when processing
a physician appointment or an appointment under the Early Commissioning Program for
Physicians:
   2.12.1. Physicians. If a unit identifies a recruitable physician for whom a vacancy does not
   exist, the commander may assign individual as excess to any existing physician position
   other than a medical facility commander position.
       2.12.1.1. The UMD excess code specified in Table 4.1., Rule 4 will be used to identify
       the excess assignment.
       2.12.1.2. Excess flight surgeons will be limited to the number the commander of the
       wing/group has determined can be supported with sufficient proficiency flights to
       maintain currency. If flying support capability changes after this determination, excess
       flight surgeons that cannot maintain currency must be reassigned to non-flying physician
       positions. Flight surgeon requirements are according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew
       Training, no exceptions will be considered.
   2.12.2. Early Commissioning Program for Physicians. If a unit identifies an individual
   qualified for appointment under the Early Commissioning Program for Physicians, upon
   approval of the appointment application by NGB/A1, the applicant will be assigned as an
   excess to an existing Health Services Administrator position, AFSC 41A1. This excess
   assignment will be used for persons appointed under the program even if the existing Health
   Services Administrator position is vacant.
       2.12.2.1. The UMD excess code specified in Table 4.1, Rule 4 will be used to identify
       this excess assignment. The excess assignment is authorized until the individual is
       reappointed as a Medical Corps officer or 48 months, whichever is less.
ANGI36-2101 10 APRIL 2012                                                                         11


2.13. Legal Officer Assignments: For assignment as a legal officer, a member must be
appointed as a Judge Advocate (AFSC 51JX) as prescribed in ANGI 36-2005
2.14. Chaplain Assignments. For assignment as a chaplain, a member must be appointed as a
Chaplain (AFSC 52RX) as prescribed in ANGI 36-2005.
2.15. Assignment of Women. Female members are restricted from assignment to positions
consistent with the definition and assignment rule for direct ground combat. Women applying
for entry into direct combat skills will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Applications will be
submitted through command channels to NGB/A1 for processing to the Secretary of the Air
Force, who is the final approval authority.
2.16. Assignment to Student Flight.
   2.16.1. General.
       2.16.1.1. All members assigned to a student flight, are considered part of total inventory
       strength for a unit for recruiting and effective manning purposes, but not considered part
       of a unit's mission strength. That is why members assigned to the student flight are
       counted when determining whether or not a vacancy, a projected vacancy, or a UMD
       growth vacancy exists in a unit, but not considered when determining overall mission
       readiness. Student flight personnel are projected gains to a unit, therefore these positions
       should not be considered for recruitment.
       2.16.1.2. The training pipeline consists of the following categories of personnel who
       must be assigned to the student flight.
           2.16.1.2.1. Non-Prior Service (NPS) personnel who have been enlisted and are
           awaiting Initial Active Duty for Training (IADT) or who were enlisted for the
           purpose of processing for an appointment as ANG officers.
           2.16.1.2.2. NPS personnel attending IADT, to include Basic Military Training
           (BMT)/technical school, flight-screening program, officer commissioning program,
           and home station on-the-job training (OJT) leading to the award of a 3-skill level
           AFSC.
           2.16.1.2.3. Second and First Lieutenants involved in initial and upgrade flying
           training activities, including undergraduate pilot training (UPT), undergraduate
           navigator training (UNT), survival training, initial mission aircraft training either at a
           Flying Training Unit (FTU) or home station, and home station checkout for mission
           qualification following FTU training.
           2.16.1.2.4. Prior service (PS) personnel from another branch of the Armed Forces or
           another component of the Air Force who have no convertible skill usable by the Air
           Force in the event of mobilization will be assigned to the student flight until their
           AFSC training is completed.
       2.16.1.3. The training pipeline does not consist of the following categories of personnel
       who must be assigned to the Student Flight.
           2.16.1.3.1. AGRs, regardless of training status, will not be assigned to the Student
           Flight.
 12                                                              ANGI36-2101 10 APRIL 2012


           2.16.1.3.2. A PS enlistee with an awarded AFSC (3-skill level or higher) based upon
           their prior service, but who is retraining into another career field with the ANG, could
           be mobilized before retraining is complete and be used in the awarded AFSC based
           upon prior service; therefore, assignment to the student flight is not required.
       2.16.1.4. Grades and quantities for each type of AFSC requirement are reflected on the
       UMD. However, there is no limit to the number of officers or enlisted personnel that
       may be assigned to a single authorization, to include a grade limitation. UMD excess or
       overgrade codes will remain "space" (indicating not applicable) regardless of the
       excess/overgrade situation that actually exists within the student flight.
       2.16.1.5. The appropriate training reporting identifiers must be updated as the member
       progresses from awaiting training through completion of required training IAW AFI 36-
       2101.
   2.16.2. Reassignment of Student Flight Personnel upon Completion of Training:
       2.16.2.1. Upon completion of formal training, a member will be assigned to the unit and
       UMD position for which originally recruited. Personnel who lack a security clearance
       will be retained in the student flight when such clearance is mandatory to function in the
       AFSC of assignment, or to complete required 3-skill level upgrade training.
2.17. Assignment Resulting From UMD Change or UMD Growth. A UMD may change
through the addition and, or deletion of positions. Major changes to UMDs are identified to the
states and units as soon as possible; normally one year before the conversion or activation date.
   2.17.1. Notification of UMD changes will be provided by written correspondence from
   NGB, Manpower (NGB/A1M). Although other offices may provide input concerning UMD
   changes, approved changes will be announced only by NGB/A1M. This notification will be
   followed by modification of the affected units' UMDs.
       2.17.1.1. Occasionally, changes to UMDs must be accomplished by a method other than
       that described above. In these situations, NGB will make every attempt to maintain
       programming and funding integrity while minimizing the impact of added UMD
       requirements to unit recruiting programs.
   2.17.2. The date the position is to be deleted will be shown in the authorization through date
   (TRU) column. Personnel will not be recruited or reassigned to positions being deleted from
   the UMD in the 12 months prior to the TRU date.
   2.17.3. The date a new position is to be added will be shown in the authorization effective
   date (EFF) column. Individuals may be recruited/selected for assignment or reassignment to
   these new positions as long as there is a current UMD position with the same AFSC
   available.
       2.17.3.1. Non-prior service individuals enlisted or appointed against projected UMD
       growth position will be initially assigned to the Student Flight. Upon completion of
       required training, members will be assigned to the UMD growth position, if it is
       available. If EFF date of new position has not consummated, the member will be
       assigned to a current UMD position within the same AFSC. If another member already
       occupies this position, the member may be authorized to remain in excess IAW
       paragraph 4.1.6.
ANGI36-2101 10 APRIL 2012                                                                   13


      2.17.3.2. Prior service personnel will be assigned to the UMD growth position unless a
      Student Flight assignment is required by Paragraph 2.16. If EFF date of new position has
      not consummated, the member may be assigned to a current UMD position within the
      same AFSC. If another member already occupies this position, the member may be
      authorized to remain in excess IAW paragraph 4.1.6.
2.18. Assignment to Excess or Overgrade.
   2.18.1. Any time a member of the ANG is placed in an excess or overgrade status, to include
   initial enlistment or appointment, the member will be counseled by their commander as to the
   reason why the condition occurred, the overgrade or excess code, effective date, expiration
   date and what could happen as a result of this assignment.
   2.18.2. Unit commanders must exercise due care in making assignment/reassignment
   decisions, giving primary considerations to mission need and ANG requirements. When a
   commander places a member in an excess or overgrade condition, they are tasked with
   having the member sign NGB 36-11, Statement of Understanding. This form identifies the
   assignment condition and outlines what could take place prior to or upon reaching the
   expiration date.
      2.18.2.1. During the counseling, the member will be briefed on the following possible
      actions:
          2.18.2.1.1. Reassignment to valid position within the same Air Force Specialty
          (AFS).
          2.18.2.1.2. Retrain to another vacant position commensurate with the member’s
          grade.
          2.18.2.1.3. Be voluntarily demoted (if overgrade) to the authorized grade of the
          current position IAW ANGI 36-2503 (Enlisted only).
          2.18.2.1.4. Separation from the ANG in accordance AFI 36-3209, Separation and
          Retirement Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members.
          2.18.2.1.5. Request an extension of the expiration date to NGB/A1P, only under
          mission unique situations and in the best interest of the ANG IAW Paragraphs 4.1.8
          and 4.2.9.
      2.18.2.2. A copy of the signed NGB 36-11 will be provided to the servicing FSS. The
      commander and member must sign the form. If a member refuses to sign the NGB 36-
      11, the commander will write ―Member Refused to Sign‖ in the member’s signature
      block. It is incumbent on the unit commander to keep members informed of their status
      and to continually work with the member to rectify the excess or overgrade condition.
   2.18.3. The FSS must monitor all actions within their serviced units to ensure that excess
   and overgrade situations do not occur as a result of assignment/reassignments except as
   authorized by this instruction.
   2.18.4. Each FSS is charged with coding each excess or overgrade condition properly within
   the personnel data system in a timely manner. The FSS will produce and provide a listing at
   least quarterly to each commander identifying those currently assigned excess or overgrade
   and whose condition will expire within twelve months. This listing will be used by each
 14                                                             ANGI36-2101 10 APRIL 2012


   commander for force management decisions in regards to excess or overgrade
   assignments/reassignments. The listing will be returned to the FSS with a viable plan for
   resolution of each excess or overgrade condition.
   2.18.5. No officer regardless of grade may be placed in an excess status against a general
   officer authorization, without prior coordination and approval by NGB-GO IAW Paragraph
   2.10.
   2.18.6. Overgrade status is not authorized in the general officer grades IAW Paragraph
   2.10.
   2.18.7. No officer regardless of grade may be placed in an excess status against a colonel
   officer authorization. Only under mission unique situations and in the best interest of the
   ANG will this be authorized by NGB/A1.
   2.18.8. Senior officers (colonel and above) personnel reassignments will not take place to
   positions which have a grade authorization below that of the member. Only under mission
   unique situations and in the best interest of the ANG will this be considered by NGB/A1 for
   colonel assignments in overgrade, IAW Paragraph 3.1.4.
   2.18.9. No officer regardless of grade may be placed in an excess status against a
   commander position. Only under mission unique situations and in the best interest of the
   ANG will this be authorized by NGB/A1.
   2.18.10. The assignment of an ANG member in dual status (excess and overgrade) is not
   authorized.
   2.18.11. Any member assigned in an excess or overgrade status must be reassigned to the
   first available position commensurate with their grade and for which they are qualified.
   2.18.12. No member (regardless of their grade) will be reassigned as an excess or overgrade
   to create a vacancy to permit the promotion of another member.
   2.18.13. No member may be retained in an overgrade status if member is assigned to a UMD
   position with an authorized grade two or more grades below that of the member. In unusual
   circumstances where no other assignment is possible and the member's continued service is
   essential to mission accomplishment, TAG may approve waivers of this provision; however,
   no waiver request for enlisted members serving in the grades of senior master sergeant, chief
   master sergeant, or officer grades of colonel or above will be approved.
2.19. Assignment of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Members.
   2.19.1. Members on active duty entitled to military medical health care and who have
   serologic evidence of Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) shall be medically evaluated
   to determine fitness for continued service. Those individuals who show no evidence of
   clinical illness or other impairment related to HIV infection shall not be separated solely on
   the basis of serologic evidence of HIV infection. Medical evaluations for sero-positive HIV
   members on active duty are conducted at Wilford Hall Medical Center, Lackland Air Force
   Base, Texas. Evaluation, once completed, must be forwarded to NGB, Surgeon General
   Directorate (NGB/SG) for evaluation and determination as to continued ANG service.
   2.19.2. Members not entitled to military medical health care who display serologic evidence
   will be transferred to the Standby Reserves if they cannot be used in a non-deployable
ANGI36-2101 10 APRIL 2012                                                                       15


   position. These members will be referred to their private physicians for medical care and
   counseling.
2.20. Assignment to Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant Positions.
   2.20.1. Any member assigned to a senior master sergeant position must complete the USAF
   Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Academy (SNCOA) in-residence or by correspondence
   within 36 months of assignment.
   2.20.2. Any member assigned to a chief master sergeant position must have already
   completed the USAF SNCOA in-residence or by correspondence prior to the assignment
   action.
   2.20.3. The assignment of a member to a senior master sergeant, or chief master sergeant
   position, who is two or more grades below that authorized, must obtain approval from TAG
   prior to assignment action.
2.21. Assignment of Lieutenant Colonel Inspector General (IG) (Traditional Only). One
traditional ANG lieutenant colonel position has been assigned to each flying wing. This position
will be utilized to assist in the resolution of potential ANG members concerns and issues prior to
the escalation to a higher command authority. This Special Duty Identifier (SDI 87G0)
lieutenant colonel position will be assigned to the wing headquarters command section. Waiver
to assign full-time member to this position will not be approved. Assignment to this position is
restricted to traditional members only, because of the potential conflict of interest between full-
time positions and the independence of the IG.
2.22. NGB Sponsored Programs.
   2.22.1. Lieutenant Colonel Augmentation Program (LCAP). This is a grade augmentation
   program used to free promotion opportunities for officers selected for mandatory promotion
   to lieutenant colonel, and to retain those same officers, who are overgrade, beyond current
   expiration dates.
       2.22.1.1. States will be authorized to augment a number of UMD major positions
       commensurate with 3.5% of total officer authorizations in that state. Rounding will be to
       the nearest number; as an example, a state authorized 152 officers will be permitted five
       augmentations (5.32 rounded to 5).
       2.22.1.2. States may use this grade augmentation authority to retain existing overgrade
       lieutenant colonels beyond current expiration date or to promote officers mandatorily
       selected for promotion to that grade. There is no limitation of this program to specific
       specialties or promotion categories.
       2.22.1.3. ANG officers promoted or retained under this authority must be the sole
       occupant of a UMD position in the grade of major and must be identified to the NGB,
       Officer Programs Section (NGB/A1POP).
       2.22.1.4. The expiration date will not exceed six years from the Reserve Officer
       Promotion Management Act (ROPMA) promotion effective date, or, mandatory
       separation date (MSD), whichever is earliest. Officers promoted under this authority will
       be promoted on their normal ROPMA promotion effective date.

     2.22.1.5. Each State Headquarters must submit a request for input of the overgrade to
     NGB/A1POP. An endorsement to the promotion recommendation and overgrade request
     must clearly state the following; TAG approval under authority of this paragraph, grade,
     name, social security numbers, DAFSC, and length of overgrade period authorized by
     TAG.
     2.22.1.6. NGB/A1POP will update the overgrade code ―4‖ in the personnel data system.
     The overgrade expiration date will not exceed six years from the ROPMA promotion
     effective date, or MSD whichever is earliest.
     2.22.1.7. LCAP promotions will not be counted against the authorized versus assigned
     when determining if a position vacancy exists.
     2.22.1.8. TAG has full authority to specify utilization of the augmented positions while
     adhering to the established limitations of this program and instruction. The LCAP is
     intended to provide total overgrade management of augmented lieutenant colonel
     authorizations. It can be used to assure continued ANG readiness by averting the
     premature loss of experienced officer resources due to ROPMA implementation and
     current ANG officer experience/grade distribution.
     2.22.1.9. The LCAP will not exceed overall lieutenant colonel grade authorizations, and
     it will not exceed statutory limitations on overall officer grade strength.
     2.22.1.10. The LCAP will permit an additional number of promotions to lieutenant
     colonel and the retention of current lieutenant colonels beyond previously established
     expiration dates.
     2.22.1.11. NGB/A1POP will monitor state utilization for effectiveness and ensure proper
     utilization.
  2.22.2. Non-Rated Vice Wing Commander Assignment. NGB has the authority to assign
  non-rated ANG colonels to vice wing commander positions. Each case is reviewed and the
  needs of the service weighed accordingly. Assignment request are to be submitted through

                             REASSIGNMENT PROCEDURES

3.1. Reassignment of Personnel Serviced by the Force Support Squadron or Between Units
Located in the Same State: Reassignment of a member between units serviced by the same
FSS or between units located in the same state must have the concurrence of both gaining and
losing unit commanders or be directed by higher authority. This action will normally be initiated
by the gaining unit IAW instructions contained in AFCSM 36-699, Volume 1, Military
Personnel Section (MPS) Management and Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) User
Guidelines.
   3.1.1. A voluntary change of assignment to a UMD position which has a lower grade
   authorization than that currently held by an enlisted member will result in demotion to the
   lower UMD grade IAW ANGI 36-2503, Paragraph 3.8. Members will not be retained in an
   overgrade condition.
   3.1.2. Only in mission unique situations, as approved by NGB/A1P, will enlisted members
   in grades technical sergeant through chief master sergeant be reassigned to a UMD position
   that will cause an excess condition for reasons not outlined elsewhere in this instruction.
   Such assignments will last no longer than 12 months.
   3.1.3. Enlisted members who have received an incentive who elect to retrain into another
   AFSC may be subject to recoupment IAW ANGI 36-2602, Air National Guard Recruiting
   and Retention Programs.
   3.1.4. Only in mission unique situations, as approved by NGB/A1P, will officers in grades of
   colonel and below be reassigned to a UMD position that will cause an excess or overgrade
   condition for reasons not outlined elsewhere in this instruction. Such assignments will last
   no longer than 12 months.
   3.1.5. ANG members will not be reassigned from a lower graded UMD position to a higher
   graded UMD position for the purpose of promotion, with the intention of returning the
   member back to their previously held position which will cause the member to become
   overgrade or excess.
   3.1.6. The FSS will monitor reassignment actions within their serviced units to ensure that
   excess and overgrade situations do not occur as a result of reassignments except as
   authorized by this instruction. Unit commanders will exercise due care in making
   reassignments, giving primary consideration to mission needs and ANG requirements.
3.2. Reassignment of Airmen Subject to Demotion. An airman who is demoted under ANGI
36-2503, for failure to maintain standards or is recommended for demotion but whose demotion
is not approved, may be reassigned to another organization at his or her request. Requests for
reassignments are granted by the demotion authority, and are denied only by the next higher
commander in the chain of command or TAG if a determination is made that the reassignment
would not be in the best interest of the ANG.
3.3. Retention of Persons Employed by Foreign Governments. With the approval of the
Secretary of the Air Force, an individual may remain in a Reserve status while employed by a
foreign government or by a firm controlled in whole or in part by a foreign government.
ANGI36-2101 10 APRIL 2012                                                                    19


Requests for such approval should be addressed to the Secretary of the Air Force and sent
through the individual’s chain of command to NGB/A1. The request should include the name of
the country, the title of the position, and a brief description of the duties to be performed. A
member so employed who fails to get approval for the employment is subject to discharge under
AFI 36-3209.
3.4. Command Chief Master Sergeant (CCM). Upon completion of their CCM term, DSG
and military technicians must be reassigned to a compatible UMD position commensurate with
their grade. Commanders must exercise sound force management practices to ensure
reassignment complies with all provisions outlined in this instruction. Only in mission unique
situations and in the best interest of the ANG, where this requirement cannot be met, TAG may
allow DSG personnel to be reassigned in an overgrade status. Reassignment in overgrade status
will be to positions with an authorized grade of senior master sergeant only. Reassignment in an
excess status will be permitted for DSGs only.

                                  SERVICE COMMITMENTS

5.1. General Instructions:
5.1.1. Service commitments are needed to ensure the ANG receives a return on its investments
in its members. All service commitments will be served concurrently and not be added together
to increase a member’s obligation to the ANG unless specifically indicated otherwise in this
regulation.
     5.1.2. Service commitment waivers should be approved only when it is in the best interest of
     the ANG or for hardship not common to other ANG members. TAG is the waiver authority
     for service commitment. This authority may not be delegated below TAG.
     5.1.3. The FSS will ensure each member is properly and thoroughly briefed on each
     commitment incurred as a result of action taken IAW Table 5.1, or 5.2. The FSS will ensure
     commitment requirements such as extensions or reenlistments are completed to cover the
     required period prior to entering into the required or requested action. The remarks section
     of the DD Form 4, Enlistment or Reenlistment Agreement - Armed Forces of the United
     States, or AF IMT 1411, Extension or Cancellation of Extensions of Enlistment in the
     Regular Air Force/Air Force Reserve, will specify the reason and duration of each service
     commitment.
        5.1.3.1. No member will be allowed to attend a training course that cannot be expected to
        meet service commitment requirements, regardless of the reason.
     5.1.4. All ANG service commitments will be documented. Members will not be allowed to
     attend training unless service commitment agreements are completed prior to attendance.
     5.1.5. All commitments incurred as a result of training begin on the day after that training is
     completed.

21.   Service
      commitment
      cannot be
      determined IAW
      rules above. (Note
      10.)
NOTES:
1. Service commitments incurred as a result of two or more rules of this table are served
concurrently.
2. Applicants and commanders who provide proper documentation of a seven year commitment
signed and dated prior to 1 Dec 98 for SUPT classes starting in FY 00, will be recognized and
honored by the NGB.
3. This is the first training experience in an aircraft of a major weapons system group; such as,
Fighter/bomber systems (F-15, F-16, A-10, B-1), tanker systems (KC-135), airlift systems (C-5,
C-141, C-130, C-17), and special duty aircraft (EC-130, HC-130, HH-60, counter drug aircraft).
Cross-flow from fighter to non-fighter and non-fighter to fighter incurs a 5-year commitment.
4. This is training in a different type aircraft within the same MWS group, such as an F-16 pilot
undergoing F-15 training. For this purpose all non-fighter aircraft are considered one group.
5. Examples are: C-9, C-12, C-20, C-21, C-22, C-23, C-26, C-27, C-29, C-32, C-37, C-38, C-
135, C-140, CASA 212 and T-39 aircraft.
6. This is training to update the qualifications of crewmembers in the same aircraft, such as co-
pilot upgrading to aircraft commander, crewmembers upgrading to instructor status, and
crewmembers receiving mission qualification training.
7. This is training to re-qualify a crewmember in an aircraft in which previously qualified.
8. Includes AU/AFIT continuing education courses, weather courses, education or professional
training not specifically shown in other rules of this table.
9. Minimum service commitment of 6 months and a maximum of 36 months for training with an
academic length of 20 weeks or more. Computation for 6 times the length of training: academic
length x 1.4 (length in calendar days) x 6 divided by 30 equals service commitment in months
(always round up).
10. Contact NGB/A1P to determine appropriate service commitment.

Terms
Active Guard Reserve (AGR)—For the purpose of this instruction, the term AGR refers solely
to personnel serving in the fulltime Air National Guard duty program under Title 32 USC 502(f),
Required Drills and Field Exercises, for organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing or
training members of the ANG.
Air Force Specialty (AFS)—A group of positions requiring common qualifications. Each AFS
has a title and a code.
Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)—A combination of numbers and letters used to identify an
AFS. Officer AFSCs consist of four characters/digits. Airmen AFSCs consist of five
characters/digits. When more specific identification of position requirements and individual
qualifications is needed, alpha prefixes and suffixes are used with the numerical codes.
Authorized Grade—The grade that appears on a manpower document for a particular Unit
Manning Document (UMD) position. Normally, the authorized grade is the highest grade that
can be held by the incumbent of the position.
Command—An inherent military status by which a member is designated as being responsible
for his or her subordinates or functions.
Direct Ground Combat—Women cannot be assigned to units whose primary mission is to
engage in direct combat on the ground or be assigned to units that require collocation with direct
ground combat units and to certain special operations units.
Drill Status Guardsman (DSG)—Unit members who participate in unit training assemblies,
traditionally one weekend per month and a two-week annual training period. Member's status
can be verified through member's servicing personnel office. Also known as Traditional
Guardsman.
Dual Status—An individual simultaneously assigned to a position number in excess and
overgrade status.
Effective Manning—The utilization of personnel in a position most needed. Computed as:
number assigned minus the number in excess divided by the number authorized.
Excess—More than one individual assigned to the same position number.
 38                                                                ANGI36-2101 10 APRIL 2012


Excess Code—Alpha or numeric code used in the the personnel data system to designate an
individual who is excess to their UMD position. Table 4.1 lists excess codes for officer and
enlisted personnel.
Family/Extended Family Member—A family relationship to another military member,
including father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, niece,
husband, wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-
in-law, stepfather, stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother, stepsister, half brother, or half
sister.
Force Management Plan—This plan, at a minimum, should consider such items for each unit as
overall manning, skill level of assigned members versus skill levels required, grade manning,
specialty manning, mandatory separation dates, retirements, good years for retirement of
members, experience of assigned personnel versus that needed, UMD changes, desired full-time
versus drill status mix, desired PS versus NPS personnel mix, etc. Such analysis should lead to a
program for the management of the personnel force that provides the optimum career
progression and promotion opportunity while keeping personnel in excess and overgrade status
to a minimum.
Incentive—The money or equivalent authorized for enlisted members who enlist or reenlist, and
officers who sign a commitment to serve in certain selected AFSCs and, or for specified periods
of obligated service.
Military Technicians—Accepted Civil Service employees who are members of the ANG unit
hired as technicians pursuant to Title 32 USC 709, Technicians: Employment, Use, Status.
Obligors—Airmen have an MSO and a temporary deferral from recall to mobilization because
of key employee status, dual status (Reserve Officer/RegAF Enlisted), or nonmilitary
delays/religious obligations. Training is NOT authorized and Airmen are not eligible to take
correspondence courses for point credit.
Overgrade—A personnel assignment condition where an individual's grade is greater than the
authorized grade indicated for the UMD position to which assigned.
Overgrade Code—Alpha or numeric code used in the personnel data system to designate an
individual whose grade exceeds that of the UMD position to which they are assigned. Table 4.2
lists overgrade codes for officer and enlisted personnel.
Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS)—A data chain composed of FSS number, gaining major
command identification, and PAS number.
Pipeline—The strength accounting status of those members of the ANG assigned to a student
flight who are not qualified for mobilization and, or operational assignment because of training
not yet completed.
Position Incumbent—The ANG member who is the official occupant of a UMD position.
Although circumstances (e.g., NGB directed unit realignment, reorganization, UMD change)
may require more than one person to be assigned to the same UMD position, only one individual
can be the position incumbent. All others will be coded excess.
Projected Known Loss/Projected Vacancy—A vacancy being created by an individual who
has submitted a letter of intent to separate from the ANG or who receives a mandatory separation
and whose loss will create a UMD vacancy as defined herein. Military technicians or AGRs
ANGI36-2101 10 APRIL 2012                                                                       39


with a projected ETS or tour completion date will not be considered as projected known losses
solely on the basis of their ETS or DOS.
Projected UMD Growth—These are new requirements (UMD positions) that have been
validated and have been added to the UMD with an effective date in the future pending funds

              GRADE MANNING LEVELS FOR ENLISTED PERSONNEL

A3.1. Maintaining Strength and Grade Manning. States and units should manage personnel
force management programs with the objective of achieving and maintaining strength and grade
manning at 100 percent of that authorized on the UMD. Recognizing that grade manning levels
may need to be exceeded to accommodate deserving airmen promotions and retention of
overgrade members with valuable skill requirements, an additional percentage is authorized.
This additional percentage is to be used only to the degree necessary to effectively manage a
personnel force management program and will not be used as a goal for enlisted promotion
actions.
A3.2. Exceeding Manning Levels. States may not exceed 100 percent manning in the grades
of chief master sergeant and senior master sergeant. Exceeding the 100 percent manning in these
grades would strictly be based on a NGB directed unit realignment, reorganization, or UMD
change. Promotions to these two grades will be accomplished under the unit vacancy promotion
program as outlined in ANGI 36-2502, and will not exceed 100 percent. EPP promotions do not
count against a state’s 100 percent manning.
A3.3. Specific Manning Levels. States should not exceed the manning levels specified for each
grade listed below. Reassignment of personnel, to include cross training, should be encouraged
to resolve overgrade assignments. Promotions to these grades may be accomplished under either
the Unit Vacancy Promotion Program or DAPP as outlined in ANGI 36-2502.
   A3.3.1. Master Sergeant - 120 percent
   A3.3.2. Technical Sergeant - 125 percent
   A3.3.3. Staff Sergeant and below - no restrictions
