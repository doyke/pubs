1. Mission: 953 RSPTS serves as an augmentation of USTRANSCOM, Joint Enabling
Capabilities Command (JECC) Reserve force. Provide mission-tailored, joint capability
packages to combatant commanders in order to facilitate the rapid establishment of joint force
headquarters, fulfill Global Response Force execution and bridge joint operational requirements.

     2.1. Reports to the Commander, Twenty Second Air Force.

members on the USTRANSCOM Joint Manning Document flows through USTRANSCOM.
Operational chain of command for squadron members on the Joint Staff Joint Manning
Document flows through the Joint Staff.
