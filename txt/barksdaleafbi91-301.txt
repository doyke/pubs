                                           Chapter 2

                               SPOT INSPECTION PROGRAM

2.1. Purpose.
     2.1.1. The safety spot inspection program provides a means for the ADWSR to periodically
     assess the health of the unit’s weapons safety programs. Spot inspections are informal and
     often unscheduled. The unit commander designates (in writing) the number and frequency of
     the spot inspections that must be performed; file this letter in the program management
     notebook.
     2.1.2. Spot inspections must be documented. A Spot Inspection Log is provided
     (Attachment 2), which may be used to log spot inspections. The spot inspection log shows
     the extent of your involvement while providing a documentation trail. Maintain spot
     inspection documentation in the program management notebook for at least one year. Be as
     detailed as possible when documenting spot inspections
     2.1.3. Discrepancies that cannot be corrected on the spot will have a follow-up inspection
     within 30 days. Document all follow-up inspections in detail until the discrepancy is
     corrected.
     2.1.4. Activities that operate around the clock should be adequately surveyed after normal
     duty hours.
2.2. Inspection Areas. The ADWSR should ensure the unit is prepared for nuclear surety
inspections and weapons safety program management evaluations. Nuclear surety inspection
areas outlined in AFI 90-201 should be inspected often and thoroughly. Use inspection
checklists and guides published by MAJCOM and 2 BW/SEW to evaluate the following areas:
     2.2.1. Weapons Safety/Nuclear Surety Training. Evaluate the quality of instruction and
     testing. Review training documentation to ensure no one goes overdue required training.
     Ensure individual’s overdue nuclear surety training are denied access to nuclear weapons or
     critical components. Individual’s overdue explosive safety training will not work with
     explosives.
     2.2.2. Personnel Performing Tasks. This should comprise the bulk of the spot inspection
     program.
        2.2.2.1. Look at individuals in the process of handling, transporting, maintaining,
        assembling or storing explosives. Verify all safety practices outlined in AFMAN 91-201
        are adhered to.
        2.2.2.2. Watch nuclear certified tasks or nuclear weapons surety related tasks. Ensure
        compliance with applicable Weapons System Safety Rules.
     2.2.3. Squadron PRP. If applicable, check that PRP suspension notifications are occurring in
     a timely manner and persons suspended or decertified are prohibited from performing PRP
     duties (line badge confiscated). Check documentation and commander’s awareness of
     suspension actions.

  2.2.4. Work centers. Check safety boards for currency, applicable safety briefings/cross
  feeds. Assess the general safety knowledge of unit personnel.
     2.2.4.1. Check the condition of equipment used for handling explosives. Ensure
     inspection cycles are maintained. Verify nuclear certified equipment has not been
     modified without proper authorization.
     2.2.4.2. Check unit plans, regulations and operating instructions (OI) for currency and
     compliance with nuclear surety and explosive/missile safety principles.
  2.2.5. Explosives Storage Areas. Check licensed facilities or sited locations for adherence to
  explosive/personnel limits. Ensure explosives are properly stored IAW AFMAN 91-201.
  Verify proper fire department notifications are made upon fire symbol change and that
  fire/chemical symbols are properly posted.

                                           Chapter 5

                                          TRAINING

5.1. General.
   5.1.1. One of the most important elements of the Weapons Safety Program is the training
   each individual receives. This includes all personnel involved with the program from the
   commander down to the individual worker. If one individual in the chain is not aware of
   their responsibilities in implementing the program, then the training and education process
   has failed.
   5.1.2. The ADWSR will ensure that weapons safety training is accomplished. The unit
   commander will designate, in writing, unit weapons safety and/or nuclear surety trainers.
   The ADWSR may be designated as a trainer.
5.2. Nuclear Surety Lesson Plans and Tests.
   5.2.1. Each unit develops nuclear surety training lesson plans based upon the criteria in
AFI 91-101. Lesson plans should be tailored to meet the unique mission of the unit. 2 BW/SEW
must approve the lesson plan prior to use. Attachment 4 is an example of the wing approval
documentation you are required to have on file with the lesson plan. Use of the ACC-produced
videos Nuclear Surety and You and Intrinsic Radiation is optional.
   5.2.2. Develop two distinctively different tests reflective of the training given. A minimum
   of half the questions on each test must be different from the other. Individuals must achieve
   an 80 percent or better to pass. Ensure test questions come from the AFGSC approved test
   bank questions.
5.3. Explosives/Missile Safety Lesson Plans and Tests.
   5.3.1. Each unit is required to produce an explosive/missile safety lesson plan tailored to the
   particular unit's mission. 2 BW/SEW must approve the lesson plan prior to use. Attachment
   5 is an example of the wing approval documentation you are required to have on file with the
   lesson plan. Applicable regulations and technical directives should be consulted to ensure all
   required elements are being included. The lesson plan must contain a section for briefing
   lessons learned from safety publicity and cross-feed information provided by 2 BW/SEW.
   5.3.2. Develop two distinctively different tests reflective of the training given. A minimum
   of half the questions on each test must be different from the other. Individuals must achieve
   an 80 percent or better to pass. Those receiving less than 80 percent must be given the
   second test. Revise 25 percent of the test questions annually.
5.4. Documentation of Training.
   5.4.1. Proper documentation of training must be available for numerous audits and
   inspections that are conducted throughout the year. Documentation proves the individual
   was trained on a specific date.
   5.4.2. Units must use a formalized method for documenting weapons safety training.
   5.4.3. Maintain initial and 15-month recurring nuclear surety training dates.

                              EDUCATION AND PUBLICITY

6.1. General. The education and publicity program complements the weapons safety training
process. The focus of this program is the dissemination of information. There are many ways to
disseminate safety information.
6.2. Safety Information Boards. Safety information boards should be in high traffic areas and
contain current information. The primary safety board will contain, at a minimum:
   6.2.1. Unit posters identifying primary and alternate ADWSRs.
   6.2.2. 2 BW Weapons Safety poster identifying 2 BW Weapons Safety Managers.
   6.2.3. 2 BW Weapons Safety newsletter.
6.3. Mishap Prevention Briefs. Mishap Prevention Briefs address weapons safety related
topics focusing on preventing specific mishaps. Feel free to create your own Mishap Prevention
Brief, but be sure to coordinate with 2 BW/SEW. Many suggestions from the field are adopted
for use by all of Eighth Air Force (8 AF).
6.4. Cross feed. Cross feed items can be obtained from mishap reports, inspection reports or
safety periodicals. If you want to brief information from an IG, safety investigation or accident
report, make sure that privileged (Limited Use) or For Official Use Only (FOUO) information is
not released (see Chapter 3of AFI 91-204). Coordination should be made with the 2 BW
Inspector General or 2 BW/SE to ensure privileged or otherwise protected information is not
disclosed improperly.
6.5. Weapons Safety Newsletters. In addition to the 2 BW Weapons Safety Newsletters, 8 AF
and MAJCOM often produces weapons safety newsletters.
6.6. Wingman. The Air Force Safety Center publishes Air Force Recurring Periodical (AFRP
91-2), Wingman, as an education and publicity document to help prevent nuclear/explosive
mishaps through increased nuclear surety and explosive safety awareness. Its primary purpose is
to assist commanders, weapons safety managers and operating personnel in maintaining effective
nuclear surety/explosive safety programs. Send an email to the AFSC Media Branch (HQ
AFSC/SEMM) at afsc.semm@kirtland.af.mil to ensure your unit receives one copy per ten
readers in the unit; this publication may be accessed and Cross referenced by using the following
web address http://www.wingmanmagazine.af.mil/. Encourage unit personnel to submit
unclassified articles for publication.

                                           Chapter 7

                      MISHAP INVESTIGATION AND REPORTING

7.1. Purpose. The Air Force investigates mishaps to find the cause and uses this information to
prevent them from happening again. It is important for ADWSRs to become familiar with
AFI 91-204, Investigating and Reporting US Air Force Mishaps; and AFMAN 91-221, Weapons
Safety Investigation and Reports. The ADWSR is an important link in the process of
investigating and reporting mishaps. Mishap reports have time critical reporting requirements.
If there are any doubts about a potential incident (such as a potential DULL SWORD situation),
contact 2 BW/SEW.
   7.1.1. All units will use the potential DULL SWORD worksheet (Attachment 6) to provide
   preliminary data concerning the occurrence of a potential DULL SWORD. ADWSRs will
   ensure that the worksheets are submitted to 2 BW/SEW within 72 hours of occurrence.
   7.1.2. 2 BW/SEW will determine if deficiencies and/or mishaps are reportable and the
   classification.
7.2. Investigation. 2 BW/SEW has investigative authority for weapons mishaps resulting in
personnel injury or equipment damage. For a major mishap resulting in severe injury, loss of life
or extensive equipment damage, a formal safety investigation board and/or accident investigation
board may be required to investigate.
   7.2.1. Witness statements, photographic documentation and physical evidence from the
   mishap scene may be required. Units will ensure that mishap evidence is preserved and not
   tampered with until released by the investigative authority.
   7.2.2. In some cases the unit may be tasked to provide technical experts to assist with the
   investigation.
7.3. Limited-Use and Privileged Safety Information. Some safety reports contain limited-use
and privileged safety information that must be appropriately protected against unauthorized
disclosure. Safety reports normally forwarded to the unit by 2 BW/SEW will be “sanitized” to
remove this information. If you are permitted to see a limited-use or privileged safety report, do
not discuss the information with anyone outside of the safety community. Do not post limited-
use or privileged information on unit bulletin boards. The unauthorized disclosure of the
information may be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
